ZAHARAH PUSHED THELAST netted bundle of goods through the lock and into the steamy humidity of the Encampment . Panne/Lorenzo , her bonded partner , hated the Oort run . Most of the Miners and Traders did , but that meant profit was good , and the dyad never passed up a credit , legal or ... according to the rumors kicking around Darkside .. . otherwise . Maybe it was the smell that kept everyone away . She wrinkled her nose . Or the menusahkan vines . Zaharah shoved the pale , rubbery stems out of her way one more time . Resilient , they gave her the eerie feeling that they pushed back . Hooking her leg into the tangled net of pallid green that twined through what was supposedly a docking port , she squinted , searching for welcome in the dim , green twilight . Well , this was where the ship had been instructed to mate with the Encampment hull . <p> A gypsy encampment . Nobody she knew had ever set foot inside one . The encampments showed up anywhere from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard all kinds of stories .. . fall asleep , wake up , and find out that during the night , the bubble-cluster of the Encampment had disintegrated into a swarm of spherical habitats and had scattered . Rumor was that miners and traders who did the falling asleep thing were never heard from again . No chance of sleeping , she thought , wrinkling her nose again . Smelled wrong , looked wrong , all sickly greens . No color , no flowers , not like the garden at the hub of New Singapore . A dozen meters away , two gypsies faced each other , one at ninety degrees to the other , neither orienting to her current version of " up , " anchored to the vines with their long , prehensile toes . One of them was naked , the other wore only a pair of brief shorts . <p> Zaharah looked away . Growing up under the Clerics in New Singapore , she had needed some time to get used to the casual attitudes about dress among miners and finally to adopt the practical , skin-tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of juice from her waist pouch , really tempted just to be rude and stare as she sucked guava . Their faces moved - smiling , eyes crinkling , doing all the body language thing you did when you talked to your mate . But they did n't talk . The childlike faces , deadwhite skin , and ropy , flexible limbs always put her off , even when she ran across one of them down low , in the near-Earth security of lunar Darkside . She 'd heard that some crazy created them on one of the orbitals , but she 'd also heard that they had come about all on their own , that their DNA was totally Homo sapiens . Could n't prove it by looking at them . No wonder they 'd mostly picked up and moved out here . <p> Zaharah swallowed the last of her juice , crumpled the bag and sailed it at what had to be the mouth of a recycle trap a few meters away . An air current caught it and its trajectory shifted . Tidak ! It bounced off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the gypsies stretched out a long arm and snagged the crumpled plastic , flipping it back toward the trap , did n't even look . It sailed into the trap 's mouth and vanished with a small slurp . <p> Where was the buyer Panne/Lorenzo had been so sure was on the way ? Now she had to pee . She blinked her eyelid screen to life , but the dyad 's link was dark . Menusahkan . Lazy one at that . Taking a nap , most likely . Or doing a porn virtual . <p> One of the gypsies had disappeared . The other - the one who had snagged her trash-give a sort of shiver and drifted gently in her direction , its momentum fading so that his face ended up less than half a meter from her own and oriented to her . Allah , they were good in microG . And she 'd been born on the platform . <p> " You are very young , " it said . He said . In English . Which , fortunately , she knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least this one wore shorts . " Is there anything wrong with being young ? " <p> " Young is a precious state of being . " The gypsy smiled at her . " Once lost , it can not be reclaimed . " <p> She felt his smile , like a shaft of sunlight slanting into her brain . Huh . She 'd heard they did n't talk to outsiders . But she had a high empathy rating .. . a nine . " Maaf , " she said , " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to sound rude . " She tilted her head , meeting those weird , milky eyes . " Saya .... I am Zaharah . " She held out her hand ... another habit she had had to learn . He touched her wrist lightly , did n't grab it . Smiled . <p> Her head filled suddenly with something like music and light and the colors that sparkled in droplets of water . His name ? " Terang , " she said , the Malay word for light . He lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished and instead , her head filled with a rich swirl of crimson and purple , touched with gold and the feel of velvet through fingers . His smile widened . <p> His name for her ? " Fair enough . " She laughed and wondered what laughter looked like to him ... instantly saw a burst of sparkling light . <p> He lifted one shoulder in the universal shrug , held out a hand . " Come eat with me ? " <p> " I ca n't . " And she wanted to . " I have to wait for this buyer . " She tilted her chin toward the netted and tethered cargo units . " He 's supposed to be here ... " she glanced at her eyelid screen " ... an hour ago . " <p> Another shrug . " Give me the reader . " <p> " Why ? " She blinked at him . " You ca n't sign for it . " But he had stuck out his hand and did n't respond . Let him figure it out . She put the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It cooed acceptance . <p> " You 're the buyer ? " Well , obviously . And he did n't react to her mix of surprise and annoyance . " Well , okay . Fine . " Panne/Lorenzo had shut down , the load had been paid for ... she checked her eyelid screen to make sure and yeah , Terang had uploaded the correct amount of share ... and ... Why not ? Panne was there to rescue her if the Encampment decided to go walkabout . " I 'd like to eat with you , " she said . <p> He grabbed her wrist , but before she could bristle , he had pushed off and so had she , and he was n't really towing her , but he clearly knew where every vine lay . She felt his amusement with an overtone of " young " and bristled anyway , even though he was right . She would have ended up tangled in vines before she had gone three meters . In fact , the vines gave the illusion of parting to allow them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing she had a guide . The maze of partial arches , masked and hidden by the pallid , twining plants , opened one after another , everything a tangle of green . No flowers . Here and there gypsies drifted , sleeping , talking , doing things . They ignored her . Bubbles , she thought . The thousand or so individual bubble habitats that the gypsies inhabited had fused together and the arches marked the joins . Sort of like the inside of a sponge ? Light seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere , transmitted through the smart alloy walls from the collectors tethered to the Encampment like huge , unfurled wings ? The platforms could n't do that . <p> The stories of gypsy tech were maybe true . <p> Her new friend drifted to a perfect halt in a small open space in the tangle of vines . They were n't all the same , she noticed , saw different leaves and different shades of green , all sickly compared to what you saw in the platform gardens . They must work just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food , provide oxygen . The gypsies brought in water from the ' roids . That was mostly what Panne had unloaded . Bladders full of frozen water mined from the top of the Belt . The small load of platform-manufactured goods they had unloaded was a bonus . Color caught her eye ... the first colors she had seen since unloading the sealed units from the ship . <p> A complex shape woven of gold and silver wire peeped from the pale leaves . Here and there , caged within the gleaming metal threads , small smooth shapes gleamed in reds , pale golds , dark green , and a blue deeper than Earth 's oceans against the black of vacuum . She pushed off , drifted closer , unable to tear her gaze away . Other things glinted darkly within the twisted wire cocoon , dark bits like chips from an M-type ' roid , a dull chunk of ragged metal that looked burned . A bone ? Tiny and ivory white ? " It 's ... beautiful , " she said . Although beautiful was n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought incredible prices downside on Earth and paid for the ice and the items the gypsies sometimes up-ported from the platforms . She let her breath out slowly , filled with the same feeling she had once in a while when she looked at the distant , small fire that was Sol from the topside of the Belt or caught the blue and white arch of Earth just right from Low-Earth and realized that down there people looked up at her . Terang was watching her , she realized . At least those blind-looking eyes seemed to be fixed on her . Smiled . No , his mouth did n't move , but she felt it . Like warmth when you come back inside after working on a ' roid 's surface , cold in a way that your suit ca n't block . <p> Terang reached above her , pulled a couple of small , pale oblongs like swollen fingers from the tangle of stems above her head , drifted them just right to float perfectly still in front of her . She reached for them , not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was okay , sort of chewy and firm , not like any particular fruit she knew , not tasty but not really unpleasant . " Thank you , " she said . <p> " You 're the youngest partner he 's had , " the gypsy said in his clipped English . <p> He meant Panne/Lorenzo and radiated ... disapproval ? " Panne 's not bad . " She ate more of the fruit because it was rapidly satisfying her hunger . " Now , Lorenzo is a pain , a menusahkan . But he only shows up occasionally and I can override his control of the ship if I have to .... He had to agree to that before I 'd retina the bond . " She shrugged . The two halves of the dyad did n't talk to each other at all , Panne had told her . She 'd never met a dyad like that before . " It 's a risk , but that 's why Panne has to pay so much share for a partner . " <p> " Why ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I .. . was in trouble . " She felt herself blushing because she was n't sure just how much Terang could read . " I do n't know if you know anything about New Singapore , but it 's still pretty strict , even if the Shariya law is n't really as bad as down on the planet . And I ... well , I 'm not very good at following rules . And Panne was loading cargo and he ... sort of looked the other way when I sneaked onboard ... and he could have really gotten in trouble . " She ran out of breath . " Later on , he even offered to take me on as a partner , and I did n't have any microG mining experience at all , not really . Tell me about this . " She waved the last of the fruit-thing at the arching curves that suggested vanished walls , the tangle of leaves and stems andfruit . Needing to change the subject . " Can this really just .. . break apart ? Vanish in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His amusement tinted the air . " Quickly . " He sent her an image of walls expanding , curving like closing fingers around them , stems and leaves writhing away from the walls , cocooning them in a dense net of living plant tissue that breathed oxygen and kept them warm . Showed her a vision of the bumpy cluster of the Encampment resolving into a host of smaller parts , single spheres and small clusters that dispersed in different directions . <p> " How do you do that ? " <p> Gap there .. . and whatever explanation he was offering was n't making any sense to her . Somehow . So the stories of the gypsy 's tech were true after all . Not just rumors . On Darkside they said the gypsies did n't think like real people . <p> Real people . She blushed , but apparently that thought had n't translated either , or Terang did n't care . She reached for the wire sculpture , lifted the delicate construct from its nest among the leaves . The wires gleamed , thin and fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of stone , glass , metal and bone seemed to attract the wan light and concentrate it . " Is this your bubble ... habitat ... whatever you call it ? " She gestured at the small clear space where they anchored . " Do you live here ? " <p> Blank response . He did n't understand her . <p> " Is this where you keep your things ? " <p> That did n't work either . Personal space not a concept ? Zaharah shook her head , thinking of the crche on New Singapore , rolling out your mat to sleep on the floor with the other kids , eating together , someone always crying , someone always squabbling , someone always throwing up or with a dirty diaper . " I like private space . " She laughed . " That 's what I 'm saving money for .. . to buy a room . On Dragon Home , I think . A lot of women from New Singapore emigrate there , and the Chinese are expanding the platform again . " He did n't understand her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Space to put .. . well , whatever she wanted to put there . She imagined a bed , a table , carpet . All to herself , and everything would still be there when she came back from being away . " Private space costs a lot , " she said . <p> Terang pushed away from the vine he 'd anchored himself to , head tilted as if listening . " You need to go , " he said out loud , and a tinge of urgency tinted his words . " I 'll take you back . " <p> All the stories of the traders who never came back crowded into her head and when he reached for her wrist to guide her , she did n't feel the least bit insulted . She felt the hurry in his muscles as he guided her through the tangle of vines that seemed empty now . Where were the gypsies she had seen before ? A shiver of fear brushed her neck . But ahead , she saw the netted bales that she had unloaded , just where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd made it . She touched open her link . " Open up , Panne , " she said . <p> Her eyelid screen remained blank . No response . She used her emergency link . " Panne ? You sleeping ? Open up . " All those Darkside stories were twisting in her head , taking on new meanings . " Something 's wrong , " she said when he did n't respond . Fear touched her . She was a bonded partner and no one could lock the ship against her . She palmed the lock panel where the ship 's smart hull had fit itself to the Encampment 's smart hull , using her personal override on the lock , waiting for Panne to break in and tell her he had been asleep . The lock opened , the soft breath of familiar ship-air startling her once more with how alien the Encampment smelled . She pushed through , became aware of Terang crowding close behind her . " You are afraid , " he said , before she could say anything . <p> And there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time she 'd worked with him had Panne ... or Lorenzo if he had showed up ... failed to greet her when she asked for the lock . " Panne ? " She felt a wordless exclamation from Terang behind her ... <p> ... and fell into blackness . <p> She dreamed about vines that caressed her and breathed into her mouth and jungles that fractured and scattered like droplets of water , and the sound of the stars singing , and after a while it occurred to her in a moment of fuzzy lucidity that she was dreaming Terang 's dreams but why she should be doing that she did n't know . <p> She woke , stretched , wondered vaguely what was wrong with her hammock , why it was so constricting . Then she remembered and tensed , pushing at the webbing , blinking in the ship light , struggling to bring the here and now into focus . Her head ached , throbbing to the beat of her pulse , and her eyes felt gummy . Panne hunched in front of the control holo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crimson fiberlight tracery decorating his scalp glowed and she realized blearily that they must be on emergency power . <p> Not Panne . Her stomach clenched as she recognized the familiar tightness in his unselected Gallic face , the subtle changes in muscle tension that gave it away . <p> Lorenzo . The other half of the dyad . <p> " What is going on ? " She struggled to free herself from her hammock , realizing fuzzily that it had been secured , imprisoning her . " Lorenzo , let me out . " <p> " Keep your voice down . " Lorenzo slapped his hand through the icons , scattering them . They coalesced behind his angry swipe . Lots of red among them . Bad . " They 're hunting for us , " he hissed . " They 're listening . " <p> " Who 's hunting ? " And she did n't bother to keep her voice down because they did n't need to worry about sound . This was a miner-ship and an old one and leaked all kinds of signature . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . " <p> Lorenzo pushed over to her , sweating fear , fumbling with the webbing . <p> " What happened ? " She stripped the webbing away , untangling herself with difficulty . " What did you do , hit me with a stunner when I cleared the hull ? " <p> " Keep your voice down . It 's Tai Lan and his crew . And it was just a drug patch . Hibernation . " Lorenzo swung back to the icons . " He already hit us once . Took out the main mirrors . We had just enough steam to duck into this hole on an M'roid . " <p> She linked to the ship 's archive , scanning recent commands . He was right . Stupid , stupid , stupid . Raging , she checked damage control , afraid , too , because Tai Lan was one of the worst pirates out here . He wanted the ship , he wanted the cargo . The crew went out the locks . No negotiation ever . " We 're empty . What do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , " she snarled , running the stats for the mirror over again , hoping for some kind of inspiration . None . They needed full mirror-capacity to maneuver with any kind of speed . This was a miner . They did n't need speed . Usually . That was why the miners hated the Oort run . It paid well , but this far out , the solar energy to melt ice into steam to power the ship was pretty thin . <p> She called up an external view on her eyelid screens . Quite a few shipeyes were down , but obviously Lorenzo had put them into a deep crater . To get out , they 'd have to use the storage cells to generate maneuvering steam just to get up to where they could unfurl their mirrors ... and he was right . Two-thirds of their mirrors were so much junk . They 'd be lucky if they could limp home . <p> " I ca n't believe Tai Lan is chasing us . " She blinked the depressing screens away . " He does n't waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Malay . Terang , bound with webbing , was anchored to a wall , eyes closed , dead or unconscious . " Allah 's beard , Lorenzo , what have you donel " <p> " Nobody goes wandering around in the Encampment . " Lorenzo cackled . " The gypsies do n't come waltzing onto anyone 's ship . You 're just special , sweet cheeks . But I knew that . High e rating . The gypsies go for that , you know . They can talk to you easy , I guess . " <p> " I do n't know why Panne has n't had the laser jockeys permanently erase you . " She pushed off hard , arrowed across the confined space , spilling her momentum with a slap of her palms against the hull next to Terang . Drugged , she guessed , just as she had been . Probably the same hibernation drug that automatically injected when you had to bail out in a lifeboat pod . Those had been his dreams , then . " You kidnapped him . " <p> " Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss . " Bounty hit . " He snapped his fingers , talking in a normal tone now , Tai Lan obviously forgotten for the moment as he gloated . " I got his description right here . " <p> " You got the wrong person . " <p> " How could I know ? " He beamed at her . " They all look alike and they 're not chipped . You just got ta guess . And I do n't think the contractor really cares .. . you know what I mean ? As to that comment of yours - " His eyes had turned to chips of black ice . " - do n't believe everything Panne tells you , sweet cheeks . We get along for a reason . I figure the angles he does n't because he 's a wimp . And they pay off . Any fish bites if you got good bait ... , ' he warbled off key . " And I 'm never there when they ask questions , if you get me . Panne , he 's pure as distilled water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just collects the payoff and passes the truth-scans with flying colors . Now we just need to get out of this in one piece . Do n't worry . You get a share of the bounty . It 's not in your bond , but hey , we 're fair . " <p> Zaharah stared at him , chilled . Oh , she 'd heard the rumors . About the price for gypsies , because some people wanted to wring their tech out of them . Only gypsies , isolated out in the Oort , were not easy to come by , and since they could read minds , it was dangerous to try . The price was supposed to be very high . All of a sudden , a lot of things made sense . Like why Panne had taken on someone as young and inexperienced as she . Who just happened to have the high e rating that gypsies liked .... Yeah , Lorenzo was a pain , but there were plenty of people who 'd take on a pain in turn for the amount of share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . No wonder she had n't seen much of Lorenzo . <p> Bait . She should have listened to the warnings in Darkside . Hubris , she thought . Lorenzo was smirking as if he were the mind reader . She closed her eyes , struggling for calm . " I think I 'll just sit here . " She let all the bitterness she was feeling color her words . " And I 'll let Tai Lan find us . Why not ? " <p> " Because you 'll die . " He smirked at her . " And you do n't really want to die . And your gypsy will die , too . And yeah , Panne and I will , too , but that wo n't really be vengeance , will it ? Just kind of a game-over , eh ? And I do n't think you 're a game-over kind of girl . If you were , you 'd be in the Clerics ' prison back on the platform . " He grinned , the crystal implants in his teeth flashing like bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even you can think they 're really human . You 're from New Singapore . They 're not even allowed to live on the platform . " <p> That was the Clerics ' doing . It had everything to do with their version of Allah and nothing to do with her . Time to start thinking . She sighed , giving her head a thoughtful tilt , lifting one shoulder just a hair , not really enough to agree with him , but just enough to suggest she was looking at the situation with new eyes . While she had n't seen much of Lorenzo , he had n't seen much of her , either . Put on a considering face . <p> " Let 's just get out of here , " she said , finally . Letting her shoulder hold that hint of an " I agree " lift . " Then we 'll talk about who is going to do what . " <p> " Sounds like a plan . " Lorenzo flashed all his teeth at her . " Your plan , rather . Which is ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take the gypsy back to the Encampment . " She glared at him . " Yes , or I do n't do anything . " <p> " You 'd really die for ihatl " He jerked a chin toward Terang . <p> " Yes . " She played the role of nave child , scalded with shame as he accepted it . What they had thought of her .... But then , they 'd been right , yes ? So far , at least . She waited as Lorenzo put on a show of considering her stand , agreeing with it . Reluctantly . <p> " I ca n't believe you 'd throw away that much share , but I do n't want to die . " He pouted . " Just get us out of here . " <p> " There 's one way . " She sighed . " Tai Lan 's ship is really strong on detecting acceleration but does n't do visuals . He spends his money on high level weaponry instead . " All lies , but Lorenzo spent most of his time in whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Allah if he was really out there , that this was n't something Lorenzo knew . That they really did n't talk to each other . Suppressed a surge of relief as he nodded knowingly , casually anchored to the hammock in front of the control field with a couple of fingers hooked through the mesh . <p> " We sneak up out of our hidey hole ever so slow and look around . We wait until we 've got rock between his ship and us and then we back up against a drifting rock , use our storage cells to power a good shove , and send it off . While he 's chasing that , we drift oh-so-gently away . " <p> " Lame . " He laughed and her heart sank . " Soon as he visuals the rock , he 'll backtrack on the trajectory and there we are . " <p> " No . " She gave him a genuine smile . Because he was buying it . " He figures we tore out of here and goes looking for us . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back , we 'll have changed trajectory so many times that he wo n't be able to find us and he 'll know it . He 's not stupid . Without a top AI to sift through visual data , it 's like looking for a planet in a galaxy . He spends his share on other hardware , so he 'll figure he can catch us heading in to Darkside and go watch for our acceleration signature . " She drew a deep breath . " But we 're going to go out , first . Find a miner and come down with that ship . " Held that breath , praying , because this whole story was so lame that a five-year-old could see though it . You were n't a pirate out here unless you carried what you needed to find ships efficiently and deal with them efficiently . <p> But Panne had to keep Lorenzo shut up pretty tight if he was going to pass the brain scans that let him remain " innocent " when he was under suspicion . Now she understood why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumor had it that he 'd done . <p> " So how do I do it ? " Lorenzo snapped . " Fast , before he figures out where we are . " <p> " I have to do this , I ca n't relay through you . You 're no good with the ship , Panne told me . He set up a tight link for me and we need every nanosecond that will buy us . " Pure vacuum-speak , and for a moment , she thought he was going to refuse , but Tai Lan scared him . <p> " Play any games and I 'll put you out the lock , " he snarled . <p> " If I play any games , we 'll all be dead , remember ? " She leaned into the bio-scan hood , stared at the blue target as the ship scoped retinal , bioelectrics , brain-wave patterns . Chimed acceptance . She had the controls . Clearly Lorenzo did n't know about her override . Not that he could n't simply overpower her and take the ship back by default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering icons as the field shifted to her personal mode , swept control icons into order , aware that Lorenzo was watching her intently , paranoid that he was . He had let go of the control hammock , drifted immediately behind her . She touched the hull with one toe , edged herself into a nearly imperceptible drift toward the control hammock , felt his attention focus on her movement and had to give it up . <p> Damn . <p> Well , time to throw the dice and pray to Allah . If He had any time to spare from the Clerics . At least Terang was anchored . She hovered one fingertip over a tiny green star , the start-icon for the sequence she 'd lined up . All the while she had been stalling , playing with colored icons , the power cells had been melting ice , generating steam , building up emergency pressure in the acceleration chamber . None of the usual red showed in her galaxy of icons . She had suppressed all warning codes , but felt the faint shiver of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ship leaped away from the sheltering ' roid at full emergency acceleration , steam jets hitting rock , pushing with enormous force . <p> Everything in the cabin hurtled toward the far wall . Zaharah grabbed for the webbing , hung on briefly , heard Lorenzo hit the hull with a meaty thud and a hoarse cry . Then the jets reversed , and the ship slowed like a ball on an elastic tether , then zoomed back down to stop at precisely the same location where it had rested . The acceleration was n't so fierce ... no rock to push against .. . but it was nearly enough to rip her weakening grip from the hammock webbing . Then Lorenzo hit her , tore her loose , and she had a second of seeing the hull coming at her fast before she hit .... <p> SHE WAS N'T OUT long . Allah had clearly listened to that much of her prayer . She found herself drifting slowly toward the control field , reached for the hammock webbing and sucked in a gasp as white lightning lanced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she snagged the webbing with the fingertips of her other hand . Trying not to move anything on the left side of her body . Her vision tunneled briefly . Broken arm ? Shoulder ? Ribs ? She hooked a toe into the webbing so that she would n't drift away , feebly stabbed at the icons , trying to shut out the pain . Got the storage cells shut down ... not enough power now to limp home .. . gon na have to depend on the mirrors and pray again that they were really operable . But Tai Lan was probably on the way right now , had most likely spotted her little maneuver . If so , it would n't really matter . <p> Lorenzo floated a half meter away , bruise darkening the side of his face . Breathing . Not conscious . He did n't look damaged in any way . She spat one soft and very rude word in Malay . Her shoulder was broken .. . she could feel the bone grind when she moved and the pain stopped her breath briefly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . If she got Lorenzo into an escape pod before he came to , she could keep him out , in hibernation , all the way home . <p> It was going to hurt . A lot . She nudged herself across the cabin , trying not to move her damaged shoulder . Paused for a few heartbeats to breathe and wait for her vision to clear , then palmed the emergency lock . The hull melted open to reveal the padded cocoons of the pods . Thank Allah for micro gravity . She wanted to move Lorenzo slowly and very very carefully , but his faint moan as she positioned herself blew that option . Planting her foot against the hull she pushed him into motion toward the pod opening , all coherent thought banished by the icy white agony it cost her . It took a moderate eternity to get him positioned in the padded space , to pull the webbing across him one-handed . She had to keep stopping to pant , to wait for the darkness to clear from her vision . If her stomach had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , Allah be praised , she got him into the pod . With the last ounce of her strength she activated the pod , watched the tiny twin bio-catheters snake into the artery and vein in his throat , saw the tension of returning consciousness drain from his face . <p> Safe . She put the unit on stand-by and manual eject mode , wanting only to let go , pass out . Touched up an injector of hibernation antidote from the bio center . A painkiller helped , but not much . No way to make the pain go away if she wanted to function . Her vision was tunneling again and she started to shiver . Shock ? Pushed off to drift across the cabin . Get Terang awake ... maybe Tai Lan had missed them . <p> He had not . <p> A bouquet of red blossomed in the control field and the port section of the hull began to shimmer , about to thin and open . Someone had overridden the ship 's hull lock . <p> He would n't do vacuum . Not if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weapon .... She tried to toe off the hull , change her trajectory to grab one of the lethal-grade stunners on board , missed her push and hit the hull with her bad shoulder . She heard her voice crying out , saw the hull thin and open , felt one moment of bitterness at the unfairness of it all . <p> She dreamed that Allah was speaking to her , but not in words . Why would a god use words anyway , she wondered , or one language over another ? Not that she was about to say that to the Clerics . She was in enough trouble with them as it was . But Allah was judging Lorenzo , pointed a huge disembodied finger and the void of vacuum loomed before him . <p> No , she said , tugging at Allah . He 's not the whole man . Panne has done good things . He did n't have to help me . Yes , he used me latei , but he did n't get anything when he let me stow away and he might have ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified ... a woman speaking to Allah like that . But Allah considered and asked her why not , when he had stolen Terang . Allah knew Terang 's real name , but a god would , would n't it ? Zaharah had no words to express her reasons ... only the feeling that it was an unbalanced thing to do . Surely Allah would not be unfair , but then the universe was not a fair place and people died all the time who should not and perhaps the Clerics were right and that was all at Allah 's will . It .. . disappointed her . That a god would be no more than the Clerics made him out to be . Allah laughed , and it occurred to her that she should fear a god 's laughter , but she felt no fear , only amusement and an oddly familiar sense of warmth , like the feel of a smile . Then she was dreaming that she slept among plants and they rooted in her flesh . It did n't hurt ; in fact the sensation of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost pleasant . She should hurt , she thought , and wondered why she did not , although she could n't quite recall why she thought she should hurt in the first place . Slowly , vague memories surfaced , focused into Lorenzo 's face , Terang 's bound and hibernating form , Tai Lan .... <p> She woke . Struggling . Bracing herself for the agony of her fractured shoulder and the realization that Tai Lan had boarded and if she was not dead already that was perhaps not a good thing . Pale vines wrapped her , immobilized her . She opened her mouth to scream , dream and waking blending horribly , but a sudden calm filled her mind , drowning her instant of terror . <p> It 's all right . You 're safe . <p> She was n't sure if she heard the words or simply converted understanding into words . " Terang ? " She recognized it now , the humid , alien smell of the encampment . Wondered for a moment if it had all been a dream , but a twinge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm suggested otherwise . She realized suddenly that she was naked , completely tangled in slender , pale vines . But even as she realized it , they writhed away , coiling back into pearly knots , releasing her . <p> She was cold . Terang drifted near her , radiating his smile , her singlet in his hand . He held it out and she took it , too stunned to even feel shame at her nakedness . The motion set her drifting gently . " How did we get here ? " <p> Her mind filled with a galaxy of matte-black bubbles drifting across the panorama of distant suns , of a large , weaponed ship heading sunward , fast . The Encampment had followed Terang . And Tai Lan had fled ? Zaharah shivered because that said a lot for the Encampment 's weaponry . Not much frightened Tai Lan . The stories of disappearances suddenly took on new meaning . As did the fact that nobody had yet figured out how the gypsy bio-tech worked . " What happened to Panne/Lorenzo ? " She realized she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . " Is he ... still in the pod ? " She imagined the open pod , his unconscious form . <p> Terang lifted one shoulder . Thoughtful . " You asked for that , " he said out loud . <p> The Allah dream . What would the Clerics say about her choice of Allah ? She stifled an urge to giggle , realized just how weak she was . And wondered if her dream about plant roots growing into her flesh was equally real . Shivered . " What now ? " she asked . <p> He did n't understand . <p> " Will you just let us go ? " <p> No answer . Did that mean yes ? He held out his hand and she let him seize her wrist , and this time let him tow her through the tangled maze of the Encampment . The space seemed full of gypsies this time - sleeping , eating , doing whatever they were doing . As if they had hidden from her on her earlier visit and did n't bother to do so now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual and friendly . Others paid no attention . They reached an area of empty space like the one where she had originally unloaded their cargo , nothing to show whether it was the same or simply like the one they had docked to earlier . Light spilled from a small oval in the hull of the Encampment and she recognized the inside of the ship , could even see Panne/Lorenzo dreaming in his open pod . <p> " How did they find you ? " She hesitated this side of the lock , studied his milky eyes , bathed by the warmth of his smile . " How did they know ? " <p> " I was n't shut away . " Terang said the words out loud . " The drugs he used do n't do that to us . " Pushed off to drift precisely over to a small knot of vines that writhed across the hull . Light glittered in his hands as he arrowed back to her . Zaharah stared at the small cyclone of hair-thin wire wound around a spiral of tiny , gleaming stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a distant spiral galaxy , filled her with a vast sense of completeness . <p> " You can sell it and buy your private space that means so much to you , " Terang said , still speaking out loud . <p> She could buy a ship with it . Not a new one or a big one , but an old steam-trainer with a good maintenance history and sound hardware . He was waiting for her to leave . " Thank you , " she said out loud , saying a lot more that did n't translate . " I would like to come back . Some day . If I can find you . If it 's all right . " <p> She recognized the slivery shimmer in her mind , like the tiny bubbles in expensive and illegal champagne . He was laughing . <p> " Just call , " he said out loud . " Try it . " <p> She blinked her eyelid screen into life first , thinking that he meant they had implanted some kind of comm link while she was healing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How ? She imagined herself calling his name , not the Malay word she spoke aloud , but the sound/texture/image of light . <p> Sucked in a quick breath as she felt a focused instant of vast attention . " I see , " she gasped . The whole Encampment had answered ? Felt a stab of regret that she had to leave , because even if she bought a ship , it might be a long time before she could find her way back out to the Oort . But if Panne spent too much time in hibernation , brain damage would begin to occur . Impulsively she pushed closer , touched Terang 's strange , other-than-human face lightly with her fingertips , felt his long , slender fingers on her own cheeks . Good-bye , she said without words . <p> They let go and pushed off at the same instant , and she arrowed into the ship , the sculpture in her hands , trailing sparkling droplets of tears . The hull sealed behind her and she brought up the control field . The mirrors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering how long she had dreamed in the vines ' embrace . Used the recharged power cells to push them gently away from the Encampment , and when she had attained enough distance , she unfurled the mirrors to their full capacity . A trickle of steam began to push her , taking her down the vast gravity well to the Belt , Darkside , and the platforms . <p> She 'd wake Panne when they closed on Darkside , blackmail him with the evidence she 'd copy from the ship 's navigation log . She might end up with a penal labor contract and wearing a collar , too , if she actually had to use the evidence , but she was willing to bet he would cave and get rid of Lorenzo finally and for good . And then she was through with him , all debts paid , free and clear . <p> She felt a brief touch from Terang . Not good-bye , precisely . You could translate it as " later , " she decided . And smiled . <p> IMG      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
