The most dramatic moment of Condoleezza Rice 's testimony before the 9/11 commission last week  --  her confrontation with former Senator Bob Kerrey  --  was also the most revealing . Kerrey was hammering Rice about the President 's now famous " fly swatting " remark . Bush had asked Rice for a comprehensive strategy for dealing with al-Qaeda ; he did n't want any more futile pinprick attacks . " What fly had he swatted ? " Kerrey demanded . And a minute later : " Why did n't we respond to the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole ? Why did n't we swat that fly ? " <P> Rice replied that she had been " blown away " by a " brilliant " speech Kerrey had given in which he suggested the best way to avenge the Cole was to " do something about the threat of Saddam Hussein . That 's a strategic view . And we took the strategic view . We did n't take a tactical view . " Earlier , Rice had described her problems with Richard Clarke 's first al-Qaeda action memo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger picture , the strategic impact on the volatile situation in Pakistan of any U.S. actions against the terrorist bases in Afghanistan . Indeed , the distinction between strategic and tactical thinking , which Rice mentioned repeatedly , is crucial to understanding the Bush Administration 's foreign policy and why it has gone so wrong . It 's also a good way to understand why the Clinton Administration 's foreign policy was n't such great shakes , either . <P> Strategic and tactical are wonky words , tossed about with impunity by policy sorts . Strategic thinking is comprehensive , long-term , theoretical ; tactical thinking is more limited . Tactics are , at best , the means to the strategy 's end  --  the practical , concrete actions to be taken . The Clinton Administration was , arguably , the least strategic in recent memory . In fact , Bill Clinton offended old-line strategic types by raising economic policy , which was considered a lesser art , to the same status as strategic policy in his meetings with foreign leaders . Clinton did make the strategic decisions to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all his other initiatives were tactical , reactions to crises  --  in Somalia , Haiti , the Balkans and Iraq . The most notable example , the " fly swatting " that Bush reacted against , was Clinton 's decision to launch cruise missiles against a terrorist camp in Afghanistan and a chemical factory in Sudan after al-Qaeda bombed the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
