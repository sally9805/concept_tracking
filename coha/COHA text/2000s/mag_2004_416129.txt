A Little History Old Salem ( or just Salem , as it was initially called ) began as a congregational town founded in 1766 by the Moravian Church-a Protestant sect that originally hailed from a province of what is today the Czech Republic . The orderly Moravians designed the village on a formal grid pattern with perpendicular streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow residential lots , each about 67 feet wide and 197 feet deep , extend from the street in front to the one in back . Directly behind each house is a fenced yard containing such necessities as the chicken house , woodshed , barn , and privy . The garden , which supplied much of the family 's food , lies just beyond the yard .

They contain plants authentic to the period between 1768 and 1856 . Because early settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest gardens harbor only vegetables and field crops such as cotton . Newer gardens dating from the 183Os and 184Os abound with flowers because a prospering town could finally afford the luxury of cultivating beauty . Awesome in Autumn Although Old Salem 's staff prepares the gardens for spring , summer , and fall , they readily agree that autumn is prime time . " Fall is the best gardening season because the segue into winter is very slow and drawn out , and the harvest is so long , " says Keyes Williamson , former director of horticulture . As the glorious leaves of maple , hickory , and black gum shower down , cabbage , broccoli , Swiss chard , lettuce , kohlrabi , beets , carrots , rutabagas , cardoon , sunset hibiscus ( Abelmoschus manihot ) , kale , and peas thrive in the November air . Sweetening with the frost , many crops last until Christmas . Home gardeners could take a cue here and plant their own fall vegetables . This is but one of many lessons Old Salem imparts , the teaching made simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The size of an average lot here is similar to that of a modern suburban lot , " explains Keyes . " Duplicating an Old Salem garden is easy . " Touching the Past If you want to know what makes Old Salem special , talk to Flora Ann Bynum , chairperson of Old Salem 's Landscape Restoration Committee . She has resided here in the village since 1952 , " The unique thing about Old Salem is that it 's a lived-in community with private residences mixed in with historic buildings , " she states . Visitors sometimes mistake her for a character . " People will knock on my door and ask , ' Is this a real house ? Are you a real person ? ' " But such confusion is worth it every time Old Salem brings visitors in touch with their heritage . " I was sitting on my porch the other day , " Flora Ann recalls . " The gate opened , and I heard a man telling his little child , ' Now , that 's a lamb 's ear .

Sidebar Five Simple Rules You do n't have to be an Old Salem pro to grow a garden this productive . Just follow these rules . 1 Build rich , well-drained soil by working in lots of organic matter each year . Old Salem applies a 4- to 6-inch layer of composted leaves to its beds in fall and summer . " Plants growing in good soil resist insects , disease , and drought better , " says Keyes . 2 To avoid compacting the soil , dig when the ground is dry , not wet . 3 Do n't put the same plants in the same place every year . Follow heavy feeders such as cabbage with a cover crop of clover , buckwheat , or annual rye ; then till in the cover crop to replenish the soil . 4 Do n't use sprinklers . Hand-water plants . This saves water and puts moisture right at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 Keep records of how different plant selections perform , and choose ones that do well in your area .
