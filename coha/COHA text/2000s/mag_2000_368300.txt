The scene is all too familiar . I have witnessed it  --  and been a participant  --  more times than I care to remember : a small team of physicians and students on rounds stops at the door of a patient in the last stages of a disease that has eluded all efforts at a cure . After an awkward hesitation , the senior member turns to the others and says , " She 's probably very tired and needs her rest . It 's better not to disturb her . Let 's just go ahead and see how yesterday 's colectomy is doing . " The others nod , and they move on to the next room . <P> Every one of the group knows what has just transpired . The students have already begun to understand that modern medicine is action , that its excitement comes from the challenge to intellect , to technological skills , even to personal daring . The greatest victories go to those who diagnose brilliantly , who are undaunted by the most intimidating confrontations with disease , so long as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are the biomedical gladiators , and their arena is the hospital . Unlike the gladiators of ancient Rome , they always win . Well , almost always  --  and only for a while . <P> When there is no victory , however , the challenge is gone , and most lose interest . Worse yet , they have suffered one of their rare defeats , and they handle it badly . They were not chosen to be defeated , and they are not trained to deal with it . They have been trained for the certainty that theirs is a noble war against death . <P> It begins with the selection process . Medical school admissions committees look for winners : the highest GPAs , the highest scores on the Medical College Admissions Test , the most glowing reports about undergraduate achievements . They like to see stratospheric numbers and florid adjectives . In view of this emphasis , it is a wonder that they manage to admit as many idealistic young people to the profession as they do . But there are not enough , and every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to triumph over great odds . When the time comes to lose , as it inevitably must , doctors will too often turn away from the evidence of their perceived failure because they do n't know how to behave when faced with it . Few will think to hold a dying woman 's hand . They will move on to the colectomy in the next room . <P> The faults in the selection process are compounded by the faults in training . Today 's medical or surgical residencies are like years on end of Marine boot camp , where the values of the group are instilled at the expense of the values brought to the experience by each individual entering it . In the presence of teachers who exemplify the fighter-pilot mentality of success in the face of mortal danger , the idealism and even the humanity become imperiled . Too often , they are leached out in the long indoctrination . The best become like their teachers : they worship at the shrine of scientific objectivity , and they wrap themselves in a mantle of depersonalization that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the name of victory over death .
