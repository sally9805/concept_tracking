Looking for a great business opportunity ? Step right up , ladies and gentlemen , and join the XanGo team . Pronounced zang-go , this powerful elixir comes from the mangosteen , a fruit grown in the jungles of Thailand . The juice is anti-inflammatory ! Antidepressant ! Antitumor ! Now you too can be a distributor of this incredible formula for a one-time fee of just $35 plus $100 for the first four bottles . Not one of those claims has been conclusively proved , but similarly worded pitches  --  made in e-mails or other direct solicitations to independent marketers have helped XanGo pass $200 million in sales in 2005 . The four-year-old company is just the latest big player in the country 's $23.5 billion dietary-supplement trade  --  much of it based here in an arid stretch of Utah called the Wasatch Front . <P> More than 100 supplement companies dot the terrain alongside I-15 snaking through Salt Lake City , Utah , generating $4 billion in annual sales  --  four times the revenue of the state 's more famous ski trade . The herbal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nicknamed Cellulose Valley , after the primary component of green plants . <P> Why Utah ? For one thing , the dry air is ideal for storing precious powders . For another , politicians like Senator Orrin Hatch have helped create a fertile regulatory climate . Then there 's the long-standing environment of support for the products . Many Utah supplement companies are owned or operated by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS ) . In the 1800s , LDS founder Joseph Smith blamed traditional medicine for his brother 's death and his own traumatic leg surgery . Early Mormon writings praised the " plants and roots , which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases . " In the 1940s , Mormon herbalist John Christopher preached about natural healing . A few decades later , three Utah companies  --  Nature 's Herbs , Nature 's Way and Nature 's Sunshine  --  began selling his formulas . <P> But it 's Utah 's entrepreneurial attitude that perhaps accounts most of all for the boom . A large portion of supplements is sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person-to-person sales . The trade publication Nutrition Business Journal estimates that $7.7 billion in supplements was sold in U.S. vitamin stores last year , $6 billion by food markets and big-box outlets and $4.2 billion via MLM distribution . " It 's a substantial figure , " says journal editor Grant Ferrier . " Roughly 20% of all sales come from MLM , and Utah is the stronghold . " <P> One reason for Utah 's MLM success seems again to stem from the church . Nature 's Sunshine became the first to go that route back in 1975 , and Mormons  --  trained in door-to-door evangelism through compulsory missions  --  proved natural salespeople . " The church provides a network  --  a real plus factor for MLM companies , " says Rory Mahony , general manager of Nature 's Way , which sells through health-food and vitamin shops . Under direct-sales plans , independent reps earn commissions for items they sell but also receive payouts by recruiting others to become distributors . The bigger one 's network , the better .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
