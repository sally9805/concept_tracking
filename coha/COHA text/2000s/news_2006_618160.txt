<p> By Friday morning , Pfc . Jonathan Jensen had been sitting in the Atlanta airport for nearly 24 hours , mostly dozing in the atrium . His U.S. Airways flight to Columbus , Ohio , had actually taxied out to the runway Thursday evening , gotten in line for takeoff and then been recalled because of weather . <p> Jensen , 21 , who just finished his Army basic training at Fort Benning and was headed home on leave , had plenty of time to consider the question of convenience vs. security at airports . He had stood in the lines , dumped the liquids , and waited and waited and waited . At what point , he was asked , does it become so inconvenient that people stop flying ? <p> " I do n't think it does , " he said . " They can do anything they want with security . They can search my bag if that 's what it takes to keep us safe . " <p> By Friday morning , Hartsfield-Jackson was quite calm . Lines moved quickly . A big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But beyond the talk about long lines and travelers removing their shoes at checkpoints , the federal government has proposed a change in security procedures that could have a profound impact on international air travel , some experts say . The government believes the new rule will make international travel safer ; the airline industry , however , has asserted that the change could have a " devastating impact " on the airlines . <p> Airlines for years have been required to supply the Transportation Security Administration with a passenger manifest no later than 15 minutes after the takeoff of any international flight leaving or entering the United States . The new rule , according to a proposal by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection , would require the airlines to supply the manifest before the flight leaves , and would prohibit the boarding of any passenger until he has been " vetted " and approved by the TSA . <p> Because it currently does not receive passenger manifests before takeoff , the government does not typically learn that a " high-risk traveler " is aboard a plane until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly Klundt said Friday . Its options then are to turn the flight back , divert it to another airport or let it land as scheduled . <p> " Receiving this information prior to departure will help identify potential high-risk travelers earlier , increasing the security of international flights to and from the U.S. and alleviating turn-backs and diversions of aircraft , " Klundt said . <p> Her agency developed the new rule in response to a law passed in 2004 that mandated that TSA get passenger manifests before flights depart . <p> " High-risk passengers allowed to board before they have been fully vetted may pose a security risk for aircraft en route or departing from the United States , " the bureau said in its " notice of proposed rule-making " last month . " A boarded high-risk passenger would have the opportunity to plant or retrieve a disassembled explosive device or other weapon . " <p> But some air travel experts and the airline industry say the rule could compromise airlines ' efficiency and passengers ' privacy . <p> " This changes the procedure from a notification requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people are not allowed to travel unless they are individually and affirmatively approved by the TSA , " said Edward Hasbrouck , travel consultant and author of " The Practical Nomad : How to Travel Around the World . " <p> The concerns fly <p> The airline industry , meanwhile , contends that the new rule could potentially be disastrous . " The member airlines of the Air Transport Association of America and the Association of European Airlines believe that such a rule will result in severe adverse consequences for the airline industry , and indeed , to the world economy , " said a letter last year from the heads of both organizations to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff . <p> The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has since revised its proposal , and an ATA spokeswoman said Friday that the organization was not prepared to comment on the new proposal . <p> But the spokeswoman , Victoria S. Day , managing director of communications for ATA , said the objections raised in the 2005 letter stand . <p> Delta Air Lines said Friday that it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " While we support a system that properly screens all passengers before departure , we see numerous operational challenges implementing the proposed rule as it is currently created , " said a statement sent to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by Delta spokeswoman Gina Laughlin . She also referred the newspaper to the 2005 ATA letter . <p> The proposed new rule was published in July . Normally the public comment period is 30 days , after which the rule may be adopted . But , at the request of the major airlines and others , Customs and Border Protection recently extended the public comment period 60 days , until Oct. 12 . <p> The rule would affect two main areas : the definition of " departure " and the schedule on which airlines transmit their passenger manifests to the government . Currently , a flight 's departure is said to occur at " wheels up "  --  that is , when the plane leaves the runway and retracts its landing gear . The new rule would change that so the time of departure would be the time the plane " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules <p> The airlines would have two options for transmitting their manifests before departure . They could submit the complete manifest no later than 60 minutes before push-back . Or they could submit passengers one by one , up to 15 minutes before departure . <p> " Our priority is to keep terrorists out of the United States by preventing them from boarding international flights , " Chertoff said last month in announcing the proposed rule . " Receiving APIS Advanced Passenger Information System data before a plane takes off is another layer of security that allows us to identify terrorists before they are en route to the United States . " <p> Regulations questioned <p> The airline industry says it is sympathetic with the goal but frightened by the way the government wants to achieve it . <p> " While we concur emphatically with the principle that all passengers must be properly vetted before departure , we are equally convinced that the suggested ' APIS-60 ' approach is not the way to accomplish this goal , " said the ATA/AEA letter to Chertoff . " Such a requirement would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A regulatory assessment by Customs and Border Protection estimated the cost of the new rule at between $612 million and $1.9 billion over 10 years . Klundt said most of that expense would be borne by the airlines . <p> While the airlines are concerned with the practical effects of the rule , Hasbrouck , the " Practical Nomad " author , casts the issue as one of personal freedoms . <p> " I think that the big impact on Americans fundamentally is not in the minor annoyance of having to take off their shoes or show up at the airport earlier , but the loss of their civil liberties , the loss of the liberty of movement , " he said . <p> Hasbrouck believes that the government 's efforts to improve airport security since 9/11 have mainly to do with surveillance and data-gathering not kidy on high-risk targets but on everyone who travels by air . <p> " Airlines and other companies related to travel have been mandated to build into travel information infrastructures the capability of continuous logging of people 's movements , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage and carry-ons , I think it creates the possibility where even people who are not now on a no-fly or a watch list could be held at any time in the future to account for why they went to Cleveland on Jan. 2 , 2009 , and why were you sitting next to this particular person ?
