Local folktales on the Indonesian island of Flores , some 350 miles west of Bali , tell of a race of shy little people  --  South Seas leprechauns who inhabited the limestone caves that dot the island , accepting gourds full of food that the Floresians would set out for them . It was n't until Dutch traders arrived in the 1500s , according to the legends , that the diminutive race finally disappeared . <P> Western scientists have long dismissed these stories as pure fancy , but now they are having second thoughts . In a report that rocked the world of paleoanthropology last week , a team of Australian and Indonesian scientists announced in Nature that they had discovered that a tribe of tiny humans , only about 3 ft. tall , did indeed live in the caves of Flores . Digging into the sediments on the floor of a cave called Liang Bua , the team found bones from seven individuals , including the nearly intact skeleton of an adult female they nicknamed the Hobbit . And while there 's no proof that the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not beyond the realm of possibility . <P> What makes the discovery truly shocking is that the beings were not , like the Pygmies of equatorial Africa , just a short variety of modern Homo sapiens . Dubbed Homo floresiensis , they represent an entirely new twig on the human family tree . Until now , scientists believed that Neanderthals , who died out some 30,000 years ago , were the only human species that coexisted for any length of time with people like us . The chapter of biology textbooks that describes our family tree will have to be rewritten . <P> Unlike Neanderthals , moreover , H. floresiensis was n't a close evolutionary relative . Its discoverers are convinced that it evolved from Homo erectus , a primitive branch of humanity whose line was thought to have been entirely supplanted by modern humans about 250,000 years ago . And while the general trend in human evolution over the past 7 million years or so has been toward larger bodies and larger brains , H. floresiensis went the other way : not only was its body small but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only about the size of a grapefruit  --  smaller than that of a chimpanzee . " To think , " says Nature senior editor Henry Gee , " that these creatures were evolving on their island while there were perfectly modern humans all around the place  --  it 's astonishing . " <P> Uncovering a new species was the last thing the scientists expected when they began excavating in Liang Bua . They were on the trail of H. erectus , which arose in Africa but had spread all the way to Southeast Asia by 1.8 million years ago ( the celebrated Java Man was the first to be discovered ) . Previous excavations in central Flores had already uncovered primitive stone tools , dating to about 800,000 years ago , mixed in with fossils of an extinct species of dwarf elephant known as Stegodon . <P> Reasoning that caves would be the best places in which to find undisturbed fossils , team leaders Michael Morwood of the University of New England in Armidale , Australia , and R.P. Soejono from the Indonesian Centre for Archaeology in Jakarta decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . Limited excavations there had revealed evidence of human habitation.
