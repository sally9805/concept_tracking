" My name is Mamie Miller . " Marine repeated her name , grinding out sounds with exaggerated slowness as she looked in her dressing table mirror . Her lips clamped tight on the Ms and stretched wide at the Y sound . She said the words faster , taking deep breaths at each interval . Her eyes were serious . A bead of perspiration stood out at the edge of her bangs . Downstairs a door opened , and Marnie heard a voice talking to her mother . Then cowboy boots made thumping noises on the stairs . Marnie 's friend Kendra burst into the room and flopped on the bed . Kendra popped her gum and asked , " Practicing for the drama tryouts ? " // " You know I ca n't be in the play , " said Mamie . " Fm doing my daily exercise for speech therapy . " She sighed . " As if it does me any good . " " Mmm , " said Kendra . " I thought I heard Mrs. Logan asking you to try out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to , " said Mamie . " If I got a part , the whole seventh grade would be laughing at me . Ca n't you hear me up on the stage stammering every line ? " Kendra popped another bubble and stretched out on the bed . " How come you never stammer when we talk ? " " Because I do n't get nervous when we talk . " Marnie smiled at her friend . " Sometimes , though , I do start to stammer , and then I think of another word to use . I pick one that does n't bother me , like one that begins with a vowel instead of a consonant . " Kendra 's eyebrows shot up . " Really ? You have to think about vowels and consonants ? " " Yes , " said Marnie . " Especially Ms. Always Ms. And my name begins with Ms ! " // Kendra stopped chewing for a minute . She sat up . " I heard Chip Thatcher is going to get the lead role . Lucky Jencie . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . " Marnie was running a comb through her long hair and gave it an extra yank at the sound of Chip 's name . Chip ! Yes , he would be picked for the lead . Anger and embarrassment burned inside her as she thought about what Chip had said to her in the hall . " Why do n't you try out for the play , Mamie ? " he had asked , leaning close to her face . " You 'd be simply m-m-marvelous . " Then he ran off to join his friends . Their laughter echoed down the hall . " It 's not fair ! " Marnie burst out , and slammed her comb down on the dressing table . " Quiet on the set ! " said Mrs. Logan , clapping her hands in loud bursts . " Places everyone . Jencie , turn your chair slightly so the audience can hear your words . Chip , walk all the way to the chalked X. You 're stopping too close to the table . And for heaven 's sake , do n't drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just nervous , I guess . It 's dress rehearsal , and I still ca n't get my lines straight . But , " he added shyly , " Mamie 's going to handle the rough spots for me , are n't you , Marn ? " " You 'll have to help yourself in tight moments , Chip . Marnie is a good prompter , but only you can memorize your lines , " chided Mrs. Logan . Marnie rattled her copy of the script and shuffled her feet . She wanted to spit a response at Chip but thought she might stumble over the words . Why had she let Mrs. Logan talk her into being prompter ? Chip and Jencie did n't know their lines perfectly , and so far she had prompted them fairly well . By masking her voice in a hoarse stage whisper , she found she did n't stammer as much . But if Chip messed up his lines during the real performance , he would blame her , especially if she could n't cue him quickly . A tiny splinter of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , Mamie 's spunter of fear had grown into a large wedge lodged in the back of her mouth . It was the same wedge her therapist gave her exercises to dislodge . But breathing deeply and repeating phrases slowly did n't always help her . Her palms stuck to the rumpled script . " You 'd better not expect help from me ! " she muttered to Chip and Jencie , who were talking and laughing in the wings . // The curtain opened with a grand swoosh as Kendra pulled the ropes . Jencie walked onstage and began her opening lines . Chip observed the chalk marks and kept his fingers off the stage furniture . Marnie sat on her prompter 's chair , a small light clipped to a shelf above her script . Her eyes were on the pages , but her ears listened to the actors ' voices . One stumble , one hesitation from them , and she must quickly throw out a line . Her throat tightened . Maybe she would n't be able to say the words . // Chip stumbled first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pants . She looked at the script and found the line . " That 's not what I told you . Do n't you remember ? " she croaked out . Chip 's voice took up the line as smooth as silk . Jencie was next , and her anxious face turned slightly toward Marnie for help . Marnie looked at the line : Many a modern man has failed that test . It began with an M ! Her lips trembled and froze . " M-m-m , " she began . Jencie 's face grew tense . Please help me , her eyes pleaded . Mamie 's heart was pounding . She could feel everyone staring at her . " M-m-m . . . any a m-m . . . odern man has failed that test , " she whispered , and she heard Jencie pick up the cue . Mamie 's relief did not last long . Jencie was stuck again . Mamie was determined to say the next line without hesitating . She delivered the words slowly and clearly , " I question his motives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last scene of the last act , and Mamie realized Chip was in trouble . If he fluffed his lines now , the whole effect of the surprise ending would be ruined . I wish I hadn " t agreed to be prompter , Marnie said to herself for the hundredth time that evening . Her throat was tight , and her stomach ached . Chip stopped . he could n't remember his next line . Marnie studied the script , and the line popped out at her : Manage that ? Most certainly ! More Ms ! She tried to whisper the sentence , but her lips clamped shut . She clenched her fists . The stage was so quiet she could hear Kendra pop a bubble over in the corner . She had to do something or her stammering would spoil the entire ending . She took a deep breath and forced the words out . " Manage that ? Most certainly ! " she heard herself say . Chip delivered the line with such smoothness that the audience must have thought his pause was planned . After several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulated Mamie . " You did a fine job , Marnie . " " But I- " Marnie started to say . " In our next play , I want you to have a speaking part . " " Well , I- " Jencie and Kendra were at her side . " Thanks , Marnie , " said Jencie . " I went completely blank . You saved me . " Marnie felt warm inside . // Kendra nodded approval . Then she whispered in Mamie 's ear , " And so many Ms ! " Chip appeared out of the shadows with one of his friends . he was n't acting smart now . " What a dummy I was ! Without your help I would have blown the ending . " He put his hand on Mamie 's shoulder . " Thanks , Marn . You were . . . were . . . . " " Simply marvelous ? " she suggested . She saw his eyes drop . Kendra spoke up . " Mamie 's going to have a speaking part in our next play . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marnie squared her shoulders and met his gaze , her hands on her hips . " Manage that ? " she said . " Most certainly ! " And she knew she could . Sidebar Illustrations by Mary Kurnick Maass // <p>
