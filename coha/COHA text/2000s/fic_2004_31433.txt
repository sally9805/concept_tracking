The Meet My God , the wedding was beautiful . So what if the bride with the translucent skin and white-gold hair ( courtesy of the ex-gay-porn-star hairdresser with the pregnant Amazonian wife ) had fucked every one of the groomsmen at one point or another in her short life . Back up . Clarissa Alpert 's life was n't actually as short as she liked to let on . She deemed herself twenty-eight , which was a surprise to everyone who 'd grown up with her in the relative impoverishment of the ( Lower ) Beverly Hills flats , where bungalow after bungalow had trudged only recently into the half-million-dollar range . In fact , she was thirty-one , but to her twenty-seven-and-a-half- ( " halves " were still important to the boy ) year-old bridegroom , the damaged scion of an old-money family , she was twenty-eight . Even her brittle-boned , anorexic , four-pack-a-day-smoker , Jewish mother , confused by the conviction of her daughter 's lie , came to believe she had given birth to this unnatural force twenty-eight years ago . Clarissa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn . She had n't really dated Sean Penn . However , Aaron Mason , of the Mason Department Stores , the largest midlevel chain in the South , idolized Sean Penn . Aaron , an SMU film school grad , was a nascent producer , new to Hollywood and its ways . Clarissa had discovered him tripping off the bus ( in this case , out of his 2002 Bentley at valet parking in front of the Ivy ) . She always had had a thing for handicapped men , and finding one who happened to be driving her favorite luxury vehicle was enough to make Clarissa , confirmed atheist , a Sunni . Clarissa had dated all kinds of men with various afflictions  --  they ranged from dyslexics to a blind Moby-knockoff singer for a techno band to a wheelchair-bound Emmy-winning screenwriter . Clarissa had found herself , unfortunately , in like-plus with the screenwriter : she had enjoyed wiping spittle from his face , she had treasured his incoherent affections . But a screenwriter ? And a television screenwriter at that ? Clarissa was only twenty-eight ( she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brass ( platinum , Tiffany ) ring quite yet . Aaron 's affliction was a clubfoot . Clarissa watched him like a tiger eyeing a fatted wildebeest as he made his way from his navy Bentley up the ziggurat-like patio steps of the Ivy to his awaiting table , where three men with chubby egos yelled obscenities into tiny cell phones . The limp cinched the deal . Their romance was short ; two weeks longer , it could have been called " whirlwind . " Clarissa squired her prized cabbage to parties from the graffitied , Ecstasy-laden banks of Silverlake to the gilded , coke-encrusted shorelines of Malibu . Aaron could not have known what hit him , though he may have known ( as we 'll later learn ) that Clarissa had slept her way , without mercy , regret , mourning or conscience , through Greater Los Angeles . But he could not have known that she lied about her age , religion ( Episcopalian at the Bel Air country club , Jewish at Hillcrest ) , mating habits , hair color , plastic surgeries , level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upbringing , her downfall , her rehab stay(s) , the number of pregnancies she 'd experienced  --  three  --  without an actual birth , and that she lied to anyone at any time for any reason . At least , in the beginning , he could not have known Clarissa was a sociopath-in-training , as common to L.A. as envy and palm trees . He could not have known , emerging from the relative norm that is suburban Georgia , that sociopaths are even more prevalent in Los Angeles than in Washington , D.C.  --  and more celebrated . And here , Clarissa Alpert was very celebrated , indeed . Prologue , or How This Whole Mess Got Started 10:42 P.M. , New Year 's Eve . The following was being scribbled onto a Le Domaine cloth napkin : January 1 , 2003 , Wish List : Men I , Clarissa Alpert , being of soundish mind and incredible ( aux natural ! ) body , would like to acquire this year : 1 . Bruce Springsteen ( too old , married , children ugh , probably happy . Level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hard Rock ( Planet Hollywood ? ) restaurants , etc. , divorced ... rich , rich , rich , engaged . Level of difficulty : 6 ) 3 .

Graydon Carter ( **25;826;TOOLONG , dozen or so kids ) . Powerful , underlined . Semi-British accent  --  yummy AND peculiar . Level of difficulty : 8+  --  P.S. Prefers classy girls with exquisite taste ... UGH . ) Clarissa Regina Alpert was making up her yearly to-do list . Lists , she knew , were important to the goal-oriented life ; writing them imbued focus and direction . She had learned this lesson from an ex-ex-ex ... ex boyfriend bartender/actor/stuntman with a permanently curled lip who learned it from a Dianetics course at the giant , Smurf-blue Church of Scientology ( which he 'd joined to meet Tom Cruise , John Travolta , or , at the very least , Jenna Elfman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn one tidbit of knowledge from every man she 'd ever dated ; though she was never a great student of school or life , she happened to be the Valedictorian of Men . She had written her " Man List " every year , on the New Year , since she had turned eighteen ( twenty-one ) . Most of her waking minutes were spent in the company of girlfriends , but this was one tradition Clarissa saved for her own company ; planning her future demanded her full and immediate attention . She scribbled on , using Larry the Waiter 's chewed pen . She was on her third Kir Royale , and work was to be done ... " You a screenwriter ? " said a voice . Male . ( No one in Los Angeles who appeared to be a writer could be anything but a screenwriter . Poets and novelists , much like vampires , hate the sun . Even if it 's shrouded behind a smog burkha . ) A gorgeous " hairless " was standing in front of Clarissa . " Hairless " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarissa and her girlfriends used for men under twenty-five . However , Clarissa looked not at his unmarked , eager face , but at his shoes . They were not Prada . They were not Gucci . They were not even Kenneth Cole . They looked suspiciously like Hush Puppies . Vomit , Clarissa thought . Sherman Oaks studio apartment , music industry mailroom  --  or worse , agent-in-training ... " You may leave , " Clarissa said , and went back to her mad scribbling . " Excuse me ? You do n't even know  --  " " Go . Away . Now . Take your ball , go on ... " She said , with the warmth of an injured cobra . Poor boy ; he looked shocked . He almost frowned , but , unused to the expression , settled for a pout . He made the mistake of trying to talk again . " Look , I 've eaten at your table , comprendez-vous ? Not interested . " Clarissa cut him off . " Bitch . " But he used the invective under his breath ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiss , her precisely bonded teeth briefly displayed . Back to the list . This year , the list had taken on greater importance . " Think , Princess , " she said to herself . Clarissa checked her watch . She had many , many girlfriends but they were n't to be trusted with her secret list . Much as she loved and adored them , why should she give her friends any ideas ? However , she had promised to meet up at the Playboy Mansion ( Silicone Valley , Tits Central , Home of the Free and the Laid ) with her girls later . There was much fun to be had there among the cheesy food , the failed sitcom stars , the dank , infamous grotto that reeked of semen , desperate laughs , and cash , and then , the endless river of gorgeous women , so many they had to be bused in , and all so aggressively beautiful that ugliness itself became a welcome commodity . But right now , there was work to be done . 5 ... 5 . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , " Have I dated everyone on the bicoastals ? " Larry the Waiter came by again , lanky as a rubber band . " Si , oui , affirmative  --  that would be a yes in any language , " he said , and set down another champagne cocktail . Without having to be asked . All men , Clarissa thought , should be gay waiters . " You should know , Mother , " Clarissa agreed . Clarissa wrote a name down . " Larry the Waiter knows all , Miss All-That-and-More . You 've been sliding in here since you were legal . " 5 . John F. Kennedy , Jr . ( rich , good family , married unhappily ? . Dead . Level of Difficulty : ... 8 ) " Correction . Before I was legal . " Clarissa loved Larry the Waiter . He was gay , smart , bitchy , and bald . A yummy combo .
