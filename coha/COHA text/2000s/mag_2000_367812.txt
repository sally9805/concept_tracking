Julie Bargmann sees beauty in land littered with mine refuse and scarred by acid-laced waters . At an abandoned coal mine in Vitondale , Pa. , she is creating what she has dubbed a " regenerative park " to capture the horror and the beauty of its industrial legacy . " New parks are n't all that different from the tradition of Frederick Law Olmsted parks , " says Bargmann , 42 , referring to the architect of New York City 's Central Park . " Olmsted was actually constructing places that were part of urban life . Our culture is now one of postindustry . Parks need to express that aspect of our culture . " <P> Growing up in the Garden State , Bargmann developed an affinity for befouled terrain during drives past the industrial dumps in New Jersey 's Meadowlands . After studying landscape architecture at Harvard , Bargmann , who lives and teaches in Charlottesville , Va. , became one of the rare yet growing number of landscape architects interested in doing more than just covering up abandoned sites by turning them into golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the land 's past , an environmentalist 's concern for its future and an artist 's appreciation of its present to create a new kind of public space . <P> Bargmann sees her 35-acre Testing the Waters park , which will break ground next month in rural Vitondale , as part nature preserve , part geological washing machine . The first in a series of parks that Bargmann is planning for the restoration of this part of southwest Pennsylvania , it is being paid for by the town along with state and federal agencies and will contain picnicking areas and hiking trails . But its central feature will be a stream of acidic water that will percolate out of the mine and course down a limestone-lined canal into aerating basins and finally to a wetland for a final rinse . Alongside the water 's path , Bargmann is planting a " litmus garden "  --  rows of cherry trees , blueberry bushes and other plants whose autumnal colors will reflect the water 's purifying progress as it cools down from a scalding orange to a soothing blue . <P>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
