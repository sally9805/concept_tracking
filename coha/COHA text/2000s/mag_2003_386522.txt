Section : culture in context <p> Although not yet released , Mel Gibson 's movie The Passion is already embroiled in a heated public controversy . Is it anti-Semitic and theologically flawed or simply the greatest movie ever made ? <p> THIS YEAR THE MOVIE GRABBING THE MOST HEADlines did n't have a major star in front of the camera , had n't been picked up by a studio , and was n't even expected to arrive in town until next Easter . <p> Still , by September everyone from Hollywood to Vatican City had weighed in on Mel Gibson 's unfinished and ( largely ) unseen film about the last 12 hours of Jesus ' life . The Passion has generated praise and protest from evangelicals , scholars , columnists , cardinals , and the op-ed pages of major journals and papers . As Gibson 's marketing director noted , " You ca n't buy that kind of publicity . " <p> The buzz began with a March Wall Street Journal article singing hosannas to Gibson 's $25 million epic , which the director promised would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Passion . To achieve this historical realism Gibson would immerse viewers in the graphic violence of Jesus ' torture and execution , have his actors speak in the ancient languages of first-century Palestine , and rely on the gospels as the source for his script  --  embellished somewhat by the dramatic visions of two 17th-century nuns . <p> The following week a less complimentary piece in the New York Times Magazine reported that Gibson belonged to a traditionalist Catholic church that rejected Vatican II , the council that repudiated the long-standing libel that Jews are " Christ-killers " and guilty of deicide . The article also reported that Gibson 's father was a Holocaust denier who believed that the council had been hijacked by a gang of Jews and Free Masons . ( Gibson himself , it turns out , argues that secular Jews have long been trying to pin the blame for the Holocaust on the Catholic Church . ) What did this mean , then , for the film Gibson was making about the Passion of Jesus ? <p> As part of their struggle against such unholy critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough cut of the film to select audiences of political and theological conservatives . Columnists Cal Thomas and Peggy Noonan , movie critic Michael Medved , and talk show host Rush Limbaugh all loved it . Ted Haggard ( president of the National Association of Evangelicals ) got a peek and declared , " Gibson is the Michelangelo of this generation . " Michael Novak wrote in the Weekly Standard , " It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen . " <p> Still , Abraham Foxman , national director of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League , had to wait until August for Icon to agree to show him the film . When he complained that even in its present form it " will fuel the hatred , bigotry , and anti-Semitism that many responsible churches have worked hard to repudiate , " William Donohue , president of the Catholic League , slammed what he called Foxman 's " politicized attack " on the film . <p> Meanwhile , Gibson , who thinks the papacy has been vacant since Pius XII , began showing clips of the film to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia and Francis George of Chicago both got a preview , as did Archbishop Joseph Chaput of Denver and the Vatican 's Cardinal Castrillon Hoyos and Archbishop John Foley . George thought it was faithful to the gospels . Hoyos praised the film as a " triumph of art . " Still , Cardinal Walter Kasper of the Vatican Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews stated that Hoyos ' comments were " purely personal " and " carried no official status . " The Vatican , like the U.S. bishops ' office , would wait for the movie 's release before offering its imprimatur or condemnation . <p> I AGREE WITH THE POLICY OF NOT REVIEWING A FILM I HAVE N'T seen and will reserve my final judgment until Gibson 's movie ( in whatever form ) is released next Ash Wednesday . Still , public debates about the movie and its historicity , theology , and potential anti-Semitic impact raise pertinent issues . <p> First , there is the matter of Gibson 's biblical navet . Gibson has described The Passion as " the most authentic and biblically accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear he believes he can bring the historical events of the Passion onto the screen by translating the gospel accounts into a film . For Gibson the gospels are history , indeed the most realistic and authentic history possible . <p> Gibson believes the gospels are written by eyewitnesses and offer a realistic and consistent record of the events of Jesus ' life and death . He believes he can compose an accurate , realistic , and authentic account of the historical events of Jesus ' Passion by pulling together different elements of the four gospels as he sees fit  --  or in his case , as he believes the Holy Ghost has inspired him to do . <p> Since he began discussing his movie , Gibson has argued that it " is meant to tell the truth . I want to be as truthful as possible , " he told Bill O'Reilly in January . But all along he has assumed that any child can read these gospel texts and know exactly what they mean . And he has assumed that he can tell that historical and biblical truth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That has n't been good Catholic theology since long before Vatican II . Gibson fails to acknowledge that the gospels were not composed as history , are not eyewitness accounts , and can not be understood without the interpretive lens provided by the faith community we call church . <p> Second , there is the matter of Gibson 's navet about the anti-Semitic potential of Passion dramas , especially one so graphically violent as his . Gibson and his supporters argue that he is not a religious bigot and that he is simply telling the truth about Jesus ' Crucifixion . <p> Whether Gibson , Haggard , Donohue , and others are right in saying the film is not even potentially anti-Semitic , the Oscar-winning director is wrong if he believes that just repeating the gospel accounts of the Passion can not inflame and incite anti-Semitic passions . <p> For nearly two millennia Christians have dramatized the story of the Passion in ways that fueled anti-Semitic bigotry and violence . Time and again Christians have incorporated the gospel accounts into Passion plays that blame Jews for the crime of deicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel accounts can be put to such dangerous use that the U.S. bishops developed a set of criteria for Passion dramatizations . <p> FINALLY , IS THE QUESTION OF the films violence . Everyone who has seen clips of Gibson 's movie agrees that it is an extraordinarily violent portrayal of Jesus ' Passion . <p> But as Peter Boyer points out in a September New Yorker article , " violence is Gibson 's natural film language , " and he seeks to create an authentic experience of the Passion by having Jesus " unsparingly pummeled , flayed , kicked , and otherwise smitten from first to last . " As the director reports , " I did n't want to see Jesus looking really pretty . I wanted to mess up one of his eyes , destroy it . " <p> And here is my concern . In movie after movie  --  the Lethal Weapon series , Conspiracy Theory , Braveheart , Payback , and The Patriot  --  Gibson 's protagonist suffers excruciating torture at the hands of his enemies , inevitably provoking mayhem that obliterates the forces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibson 's most " realistic " films is a central tenet of American cinema . We see it in classics like Shane and the contemporary films of Eastwood and Schwarzenegger . It 's " I 'll be back " theology ; the theology of the avenging angel . <p> And when someone whose movies are shot through with this theology makes a film about the Passion of Christ and believes that violence is the language of authenticity , there may be reason to pause . Boyer notes in the New Yorker that Gibson " perceives the Passion as a heroic action story , " and that the director " had once said he was n't interested in making a religious movie , and in The Passion he had n't . He was making a war movie . " <p> Indeed , when Boyer describes the Resurrection scene in Gibson 's film ( which he has seen ) , the reporter notes that " Gibson 's resurrected Christ rises in the tomb with a steely glare , then strides purposefully into the light , to the insistent beat of martial drums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive us , for we knew not what we were doing . <p> It 's not so hard to imagine him saying , " I told you I 'd be back .
