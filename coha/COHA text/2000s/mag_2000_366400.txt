It used to be that gay men who wanted to meet other gay men had limited options . Among them : go to a bar , or learn to love solitude . Then came the Internet . Now , millions of gay men wait in line  --  not to pay a cover charge or order a drink , but to get into the men-for-men chat rooms on America Online . <P> According to estimates by Internet demographers , 20% of AOL 's 21 million subscribers are gay , and at nearly all hours , the men-for-men chat rooms are filled with guys looking for Mr. Right . ( On a random night in AOL 's Town Square area , 140 of the first 200 chat rooms were labeled M4M . ) " Unless you 're John McCain , you ca n't always look at someone 's face and know they 're gay , " says Internet-privacy expert John Aravosis , jokingly referring to the candidate 's remark about his ability to spot gays in the military . " The chat rooms are a place where people can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's changed the world , " says Peter Ian Cummings , publisher of XY magazine , a title aimed at young gay men . " If you ask gay men under 25 how they meet people , I think 99% would say they 've met people online , and the vast majority of them would say they use AOL . " ( Women-for-women chat rooms are not yet nearly as integral to lesbian dating . ) <P> Most men-for-men chat rooms are organized geographically . Members select a chat room heading , like " ClevelandM4M , " and click on the who 's chatting button to see a list of folks in the room . Listed with each individual 's screen name is an accompanying profile  --  a personal resume of sorts , whose details vary from person to person and city to city . When a surfer finds a profile he likes , rather than have an ice-breaking conversation on the chat-room bulletin board , he 'll usually send an instant message to the potential paramour with an invitation to a private room . Says TV producer Jim Fraenkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything , and within a few minutes you 'll start getting instant messages from people who are reading your profile . " <P> While the chat rooms are filling a void for millions of men , the gay community 's relationship with AOL is more of a love-hate affair . In 1998 an AOL employee let slip the identity of gay naval officer Timothy R. McVeigh to a Navy investigator , resulting in McVeigh 's discharge for violation of the " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy . AOL issued a public apology , but complaints have persisted that AOL holds gay customers to different , stricter standards , both in chat rooms and on personal profiles . " There 's a sense , " says Cummings , " that they do n't want to acknowledge who gives them their money . " Last October a Fort Worth , Texas , man 's profile was deleted because he mentioned his preferred sexual position . Frank Provasek of the local a.c.l.u. chapter conducted an informal investigation and said gay men 's profiles are often removed or modified because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " AOL values all of its 21 million members . We want to make the online experience enjoyable , fun and safe for everyone , and we value and honor our members ' privacy . " If there is censorship , it is uneven ; anyone who glances at M4M ( and straight ) chat rooms is likely to find a number of graphic and suggestive profiles.
