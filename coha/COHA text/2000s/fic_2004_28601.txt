Chapter One CAITLYN RAINE SAT on the hard concrete bench and watched , mesmerized by the great cat 's regal beauty . Muscles rippled under the midnight-black coat as the beast stalked behind the fencing , its copper-colored eyes never leaving her own . This section of the Audubon Zoo had been her favorite place to escape since she 'd moved to New Orleans nineteen months ago . How many times had she come here , walking alone through the famous Garden District to get to this solitary spot ? The zoo provided a peace she could n't find in her job or in herself . The cages and habitats , each specifically designed for a unique species , provided an ordered respite from a world that never quite made sense . A world where Cate just never quite fit in . But the world would provide no cage for Caitlyn . She 'd find no safe haven , and there were no easy answers . She 'd spent her whole life stalking demons , the kind on the street and the kind that lived inside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , hunting down the killers and the rapists and the vandals . And day after day she testified in court . The stalwart detective . Just the facts , ma'am . No need to get emotional . No need to let the jury know you saved their children by gettingthat monster off the street . Why bother ? There would just be another monster to take his place tomorrow . But no matter how futile , Cate did her job . And she did it well . She had to . How else could she prove that the voice in her head was wrong ? That familiar low whisper with her mother 's southern drawl . You 're a bad girl , Caitlyn . A cursed girl . You should n't never have been born . Amazing that the voice could persist even after the woman was gone . The day Cate had graduated from high school , her mother had walked away , taking her anger and her superstitions with her , and leaving seventeen-year-old Cate to fend for herself . It hurt , yes . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the voice in her head remained , and so Cate came here to the zoo to escape that proclamation , to silence that persistent voice . And hour after hour she 'd lose herself in the sweet pleasure of doing nothing but watching the great cats move about . Their lives were her escape , and she loved them for it . But it was the one called Midnight that she loved the most . Even more aloof than his counterparts , and certainly more violent , the cat had been relegated to private quarters - a smaller habitat off the main panther area . And Cate had kept silent vigil , watching the cat , feeling absurdly , pathetically , as if there was a bond between them . Today , she 'd once again succumbed to the urge to come here , ignoring Adam 's offer to buy her a beer and his protest that it was n't right to spend her birthday alone . She sighed . He was probably right . She probably should have accepted her partner 's offer , but she just could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not when she was alone and turning thirty . With a tug , she hefted her backpack into her lap , then pulled out a package wrapped in gold paper . It was from Kimberly , the only person in the world Cate might actually call a close friend . They 'd met in Los Angeles , and for some reason Kimberly had taken a liking to Cate , managing during the years Cate worked for the LAPD to break through one or two of Cate 's thick stone walls . Cate twisted the package , examining its sides and corners , and imagining that it held something fabulous . Unlike Cate , who 'd happily shop at Goodwill for the rest of her life , Kimberly had good taste and knew how to wield it . With a little sigh , Cate allowed herself to wish that Kimberly was at home by her telephone . But her friend was out of reach , happily tripping through Europe , and Cate had no idea how to locate her . And despite her law-enforcement connections , using Interpol to track down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even for a thirtieth birthday . " Besides , " she said , looking once again toward the panther , " I 've got you . " The cat stopped stalking and cocked his head , those copper eyes peering at her over the wide , flat nose . Cate shivered , suddenly certain the beast had understood her . She licked her lips . " I hope it 's okay if I spend my birthday with you . " A few more seconds passed , and the cat 's gaze never wavered . Then he blinked - a gesture Cate took as acquiescence - and resumed pacing the habitat . Cate scowled , shaking her head at her own foolishness as she turned her attention from the cat back to the package in her lap . She found an untaped section of the thick gold paper and slipped her pinkie nail - the only one she had n't bitten off - under , edging it along until the tape peeled up . Slowly , she urged the tape away , careful not to let any of the gold color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Kimberly had used a lot of tape . It took almost ten minutes , but finally Cate managed to remove the wrapping paper intact . She folded it into a square and tucked it into her purse before turning to the box . Her unwrapping ritual was grueling and probably a little silly , but Cate loved it . Loved the anticipation that came from peeling back layer after layer of colored paper and tape to get to the goody buried deep inside . With a present , you always knew the digging was worth it . With people , you simply could n't be that sure . ( Continues ... )
