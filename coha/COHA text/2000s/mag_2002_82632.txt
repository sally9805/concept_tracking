Big Red Alert Iowa State 's dismantling of Nebraska exposed the precipitous decline in the Cornhuskers ' level of talent // Even as Iowa State 's players and coaches celebrated their 36-14 rout of visiting Nebraska last Saturday , they expressed bewilderment at the one-sidedness of the game . " That was really weird , " Cyclones running backs coach Tony Alford said after the game . " Going in , we did n't think we could run for 192 yards against that team . " Iowa State senior quarterback Seneca Wallace , who needed little of his trademark flash to take advantage of the Cornhuskers ' shoddy defense for 270 total yards and three touchdowns , said , " For us to come in here and beat them and dominate in all areas , it 's still surprising . " // Surprising does n't begin to describe the shift in power that has taken place in the Big 12 North . Think of a guard dog suddenly being attacked by its chew toy . After beating a team that had crushed them the last seven seasons by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2-0 in the Big 12 North ) rose from No. 19 to 15 in the AP poll . Nebraska fell to 3-2 , 0-1 in the conference and dropped out of the poll for the first time since Oct. 4 , 1981 ( a span of 348 consecutive rankings ) . // The Cornhuskers , who 'd had two weeks to fix the problems exposed on both sides of the ball in their 40-7 loss at Penn State , committed five turnovers and 10 penalties . Their renowned ground game picked up 81 yards in a performance that coach Frank Solich called inept . " We did not play well , " said Solich , his face drawn tighter than a size-16 collar on a 17 neck . " Well either splinter apart or we 'll come together . There 's no middle ground . " // After producing four All-Americas in the defensive front seven from 1993 through ' 97 , Nebraska did n't have one in the past four seasons . In fact the vaunted Blackshirts defense has n't been as fearsome since longtime defensive coordinator Charlie McBride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been equally dramatic on offense . Freshman tackle Richie Incognito is considered one of the two best blockers in a program with a tradition that no offensive lineman is good enough to play until his third season . // Nebraska 's most glaring problem may be at quarterback , where junior Jammal Lord has struggled to replace Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch . Lord is the Huskers ' leading rusher , but defenses do n't respect his arm ; Lord has completed only 48.5% of his passes and thrown more interceptions ( five ) than touchdown passes ( four ) . " At times Jammal can take his ability and make something work , " Solich said . " When you play a good football team , he has got to be more than that . " In other words , Lord is n't skilled enough to freelance . // For the past three decades Nebraska has dominated with a formula that combined speed from the Sunbelt with local-grown talent . It 's too early to predict whether Solich will make staff changes after the season to get the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huskers ' last two games , he may have to do something . // Is N.C. State for Real ? Unbeaten , But Untested // North Carolina State may be the only 6-0 team in the nation , but if its No. 16 ranking is any indication , few people outside the Atlantic Coast Conference , or even outside Raleigh , think the Wolfpack is as good as its record . " We 're still trying to erase the doubts of people who consider us a shaky team , " senior safety Terrence Holt says . " We know it would be tough to play for the national championship if we lost a game . We have n't earned that respect yet . " // N.C. State wo n't elevate its stature by beating up on Division I-AA teams , as it did in a 34-0 rout of East Tennessee State on Aug. 31 and a 56-24 drubbing of Massachusetts last Saturday . Of the Wolfpack 's four I-A opponents to date , only Texas Tech ( 3-2 ) has a winning record , and N.C. State needed overtime to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , has allowed a young offense to jell around the nation 's winningest junior quarterback , Philip Rivers , who has thrown for 1,481 yards and 13 touchdowns and is second in the nation in passing efficiency ( 177-4 rating ) . Another major reason the Wolfpack is averaging 418.3 yards and 45.3 points is freshman T.A . McLendon , an explosive 5 ' 11 " , 214-pound tailback who has rushed for 421 yards and 10 touchdowns . McLendon ( the T.A . stands for Tristian Akeen ) has made a smooth transition from Albemarle ( N.C. ) High , where he earned the nickname " Touchdown Anytime " after setting national records for touchdowns in a career ( 178 ) and a season ( 71 as a senior ) . " I never expected to do as well as I 'm doing , " says McLendon . " I 've come into college and been able to do the same stuff I did in high school . " // With the favorable schedule continuing , N.C. State is starting to believe that it can go undefeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the season finale on Nov. 23 , when it hosts Florida State . // Louisville 's Shocker Ragone Just Flingin ' in the Rain // By malting the footing equally treacherous for both teams , the torrential rain that Tropical Storm Isidore dumped upon Papa John 's Cardinal Stadium last Thursday night helped home-standing Louisville in its 26-20 overtime upset of fourth-ranked Florida State . The Cardinals won because senior quarterback Dave Ragone adjusted to the wet weather conditions far better than did Seminoles sophomore Chris Rix . // Ragone completed 15 of 27 passes for 182 yards and two second-half touchdowns . He also rushed for 81 yards  --  albeit a net of 43 counting six sacks and a total of minus 38 yards  --  as Florida State gave him room to run in front of its zone defense . " In their first four games they played a lot of man , " said Ragone . " Against us they dropped seven into zone coverage . When a defense does that , there are holes to throw to , but you have to make sure you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be smart with the football . " // Afterward , Florida State coach Bobby Bowden was singing Ragone 's praises . " Ragone made so many big plays , " said Bowden . " We got to him and got in his face , but he tucked it and ran for first downs over and over . He just killed us . He 's as good as any quarterback I 've seen this year . " // Meanwhile , Rix , who completed 2 of 12 passes in the first half , played better in the second  --  12 for 20 for 145 yards and a touchdown  --  but faltered with the game on the line . His ill-advised throw on the first play of overtime was intercepted by safety Anthony Floyd . One play later Louisville tailback Henry Miller ran 25 yards for a touchdown , touching off a celebration on the field that spilled over and lasted , at least in Ragone 's apartment , until 5 a.m. on Friday . " We 're still savoring the moment , " Ragone said on Saturday morning . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big win ; its next game is n't until Oct. 8 , at Memphis .
