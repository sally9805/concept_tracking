Headnote THE STRONGEST PERFORMERS , NEW AND OLD , IN OUR 2006 TEST GARDENS ARE WORTHY OF A SPOT IN YOUR GARDEN // The annual OG Test Garden project has one simple goal : To grow new varieties in conditions like yours and report the results so you can decide whether they are worth planting in your garden . This year , we made an additional request to the companies that provide the seeds : Give us seeds of your best new varieties , as always , but also let us try older underappreciated ones you believe deserve a spot in organic gardens . In the spring of 2006 , we planted 11 varieties of tomatoes , five peppers , a dozen beans , and assorted other eggplants , carrots , greens , melons , and more , plus a bouquet of annual flowers , in our test gardens near our offices in Pennsylvania and around the country . Throughout the season , we assessed how each performed and tasted , and afterward we gathered all the results into this comprehensive report you can use to plan your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated the flowers and vegetables they grew for taste , yield , vigor , and looks . But time spent in the garden is not just about the tastiest tomato or the biggest cabbage . We share here the winning flavors and colors of the season , and also our inspired ideas and successful techniques . Even with 166 years of gardening know-how among six testers , our gardens teach us lessons every season . One that we all agree on : Gardens keep us firmly rooted in the natural world ... and well entertained . Soil matters : Cabbage , big ( ' Filderkraut ' ' ) and beautiful ( ' Amethyst ' ' ) and carrots , long and strong , thrive in the compost-rich soil of the OG Test Garden near Emmaus , Pennsylvania . gallery of winners The rewards of creating a bountiful and beautiful organic garden are rich and varied , like the moment when you notice dragonflies cruising in the morning mist or bite into the first ripe sweet pepper of the summer .

Source : 6 " Opera Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . right for your region A best pick in our Pennsylvania summer , with its heat and humidity and above-average fungi population , may not be the right choice in Olympia , Washington , where summers are cool and slugs are fat and happy . So each tester awarded the varieties they recommend with a check mark , which means " this earned a spot in my garden next year . " High praise , indeed ! ( Due to lack of space or less-than-perfect weather , not every tester grew every variety . ) Also note the Flavor and Yield columns , an average of the i-to-io ratings by each tester . Key to the charts : checkmark = Loved it ! ballot X = Wo n't grow it again O = Not grown Sources : See page 51 Tomatoes This year 's tomatoes were a motley crew : a tiny mound of a plant that , for all its cuteness , could n't outrun the diseases ( ' Hardin 's Miniature ' ' ) , a very sweet large cherry ( ' Una Hartsock ' ' ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have fared better in a drier summer , and several hybrids that proved to be the best performers . We grew 11 varieties of tomatoes in all , but chose those listed below as our overall favorites : two luscious grillers and one perfect orb . Salad Greens From the smooth and buttery ( ' Adrians ' ' ) , to the weird and spicy ( " Wrinkled Crinkled ' ' ) , the strikingly beautiful ( ' Oriole ' ' ) to the puzzling and wild ( ' Liscia ' ' ) , the greens in our test gardens were unconventional . But delicious ! A late-summer planting of " Sunset " lettuce and the odd-looking but tasty cress produced well into fall . Peppers An interesting and colorful bunch , our featured peppers include a small but tasty fryer , a sweet orange hunk , and one that ripened to a chocolatey brown . The latter , " Holy Mole ' ' , the first hybrid pasilla-type pepper , proved to be a champion producer and made an excellent mole sauce . " Satsuma " could sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowers We plant flowers for entertainment . The 4- to 5-foot " La Ribera " marigolds gave us much to talk about . They formed a thick , green hedge that became a magnet ( perhaps a trap crop ? ) for Japanese beetles ... then the assassin bugs moved in and began sucking the life out of the beetles ! In October , the hedges burst into glorious bloom in all six test gardens , Northwest to Southeast . The others gave us a fresh look at familiar faces . Off the Charts A few unofficial , yet marvelous , plants always find their way into the Pennsylvania test garden . Here are several that we just had to recommend : " Red Shield " hibiscus Is a shrublike plant with maroon-purple foliage that you can grow from seed . We paired it with cosmos . " Tidalwave Silver " petunia won over avowed petunia skeptics when it clambered over a pile of rocks and transformed an eyesore into a focal point . Phacella , a cover crop that likes it cool , has blue flowers and attracts lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Piper sudangrass forms a 7-foot-tall barrier that waves in the breeze , while extracting the soil 's wealth of minerals . We used it to give last year 's sunflower bed a rest . Come one , come all : Colorful zinnias , marigolds , and clovers attract pollinators. the testers We are a community garden that has no shared fence and crosses many geographic boundaries . But we share seeds , stories , and solutions . When John lamented the loss of his squash to borers , for instance , Don suggested planting earlier . Even if a solution is not at hand , there is comfort in knowing that tomatoes succumb to diseases and squash run amok in other gardens , too . Most of all , we work together to gather information that you can use to be more successful in your garden . Pam Ruoh Emmaus , Pennsylvania ( Zone 6 ) The Organic GardenlngJest Garden ( at the Rodale family farm ) Is just one component of a multi-use property , so It Is Important that we define the boundaries . This was the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetable plots . It became a problem solver in several ways . We discover new combinations by mixing attractive leafy vegetables like kale in with the sturdy marigolds , sunflowers , zinnias , ageratums , salvias , and agastaches that make up the border . It is beautiful and it 's a pollinator magnet , but best of all It acts as something of an insurance policy . Pest insects are ( mostly ) kept in check by a diverse population of their predators that visit the flowers . To rebuild the soil in the border that nurtured last year 's sunflowers , we planted sudangrass , a 7-foot-tall wall of annual grass that sways with the wind . Fast-growing buckwheat fills In gaps left by plants that bloom and then expire . " ' Purple Majesty " millet interplanted with pink cosmos keeps the feathery cosmos stalks from crashing down in high winds .

He manages a garden for the homeless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community Gardening Association . Don has to deal with red clay ( nothing compost ca n't cure , he says ) , but he gets three full seasons of gardening : spring , summer , and fall . Here are his tips for southern gardens : ( ? ) Set squash transplants out right after the frost date , and you 'll get fruit before the borers show up . ( 2 ) Space your plants well apart to discourage diseases . ( 3 ) Pine needles are usually recommended as a mulch for trees and shrubs , but they 're excellent around vegetables also , and easy to find in the South . " To sow tiny seeds , mix them with sand and shake them onto the flat with a saltshaker. " - Don Boekelheide John Gutkowski Mokena , Illinois ( Zone 5 ) John is known for seasoning his gardening reports with cooking tips . " Violet de Galmi " onions , he says , are great " sliced and mixed with tomatoes , garlic , Parmesan dressing , and cucumbers . " He makes the most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall bamboo stakes to create artful tepeelike supports , with plant labels flying like flags at eye height . " My raised beds are excellent for succession planting , " John says . " From the same bed , I may harvest peas in early spring , beans during summer , and lettuce In fall . " Andrea Ray Chandler Olathe , Kansas ( Zone 5 ) An entomologist as well as a gardener , Andrea is acutely tuned in to the comings and goings of insects and their predators . She serves up water for frogs and dragonflles , nooks and crannies for garter snakes , and flowers and herbs-lemon balm , basil , sage , lovage , fennel , and dill-for predatory wasps , green lacewings , lady beetles , wheel bugs , and other helpmates . " I 'm always glad to see papernest wasps cruising around the broccoli and cabbages , looking for caterpillars to take home and feed their children , " she says . Even dandelions and Queen Anne 's lace have a function in her garden , as sources of nectar for her flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Debbie shifted her focus from supplying vegetables to the farmers ' market patrons of Olympia to feeding just her family and friends , and In the process rediscovered the importance of gardening for satisfying the soul . When she escaped one day to a neglected corner of the garden to knock down a mess of weeds , she uncovered a clump of chives planted more than 10 years ago and a forgotten asparagus patch . " Some people wonder why I leave " dead " plants in the garden , " she muses . That 's because I believe that plants are stronger than we think . Just when I think they ca n't possibly survive , they prove me wrong . " A case In point : This year , she did not get to planting her garlic until late January . Surprise ! It was one of her best garlic crops ever . " Slice cover crops and weeds just under the soil surface and turn them under . Add a layer of compost to smother surviving weeds ; then plant right into it . " - Debbie Leung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nan 's dry-climate garden , every plant requires irrigation . To keep her tomatoes off the ground ( and the irrigation pipes ) , she uses this system : " I buy sheets of 4-foot-tall and 7-foot-wide concrete reinforcing wire mesh at the big box store . I bend each sheet into a cylinder by connecting the short ends with zip ties-one each at the top and bottom ; one or two in the middle . Each cylinder fits over two plants . The mesh has 6-inch openings-big enough for me to reach in to guide branches through the mesh , prune errant branches , fertilize , and harvest ! " " This year , I removed my seedlings from the heat mat as soon as they germinated , rather than waiting until they were a few inches tall . I had almost no damping-off problems !
