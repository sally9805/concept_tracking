Paladin of Souls A Novel Chapter One Ista leaned forward between the crenellations atop the gate tower , the stone gritty beneath her pale hands , and watched in numb exhaustion as the final mourning party cleared the castle gate below . Their horses ' hooves scraped on the old cobblestones , and their goodbyes echoed in the portal 's vaulting . Her earnest brother , the provincar of Baocia , and his family and retinue were last of the many to leave , two full weeks after the divines had completed the funeral rites and ceremonies of the interment . Dy Baocia was still talking soberly to the castle warder , Ser dy Ferrej , who walked at his stirrup , grave face upturned , listening to the stream , no doubt , of final instructions . Faithful dy Ferrej , who had served the late Dowager Provincara for all the last two decades of her long residence here in Valenda . The keys of the castle and keep glinted from the belt at his stout waist . Her mother 's keys , which Ista had collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with all the other papers and inventories and instructions that a great lady 's death entailed . And that he had handed back for permanent safekeeping not to his sister , but to good , old , honest dy Ferrej . Keys to lock out all danger ... and , if necessary , Ista in . It 's only habit , you know . I 'm not mad anymore , really . It was n't as though she wanted her mother 's keys , nor her mother 's life that went with them . She scarcely knew what she wanted . She knew what she feared  --  to be locked up in some dark , narrow place by people who loved her . An enemy might drop his guard , weary of his task , turn his back ; love would never falter . Her fingers rubbed restlessly on the stone . Dy Baocia 's cavalcade filed off down the hill through the town and was soon lost from her view among the crowded red-tiled roofs . Dy Ferrej , turning back , walked wearily in through the gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strand of Ista 's dun hair and blew it across her face , catching on her lip ; she grimaced and tucked it back into the careful braiding wreathing her head . Its tightness pinched her scalp . The weather had warmed these last two weeks , too late to ease an old woman bound to her bed by injury and illness . If her mother had not been so old , the broken bones would have healed more swiftly , and the inflammation of the lungs might not have anchored itself so deeply in her chest . If she had not been so fragile , perhaps the fall from the horse would not have broken her bones in the first place . If she had not been so fiercely willful , perhaps she would not have been on that horse at all at her age ... Ista looked down to find her fingers bleeding , and hid them hastily in her skirt . In the funeral ceremonies , the gods had signed that the old lady 's soul had been taken up by the Mother of Summer , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate her views on protocol . Ista imagined the old Provincara ordering heaven , and smiled a little grimly . And so I am alone at last . Ista considered the empty spaces of that solitude , its fearful cost . Husband , father , son , and mother had all filed down to the grave ahead of her in their turn . Her daughter was claimed by the royacy of Chalion in as tight an embrace as any grave , and as little likely to return from her high place , five gods willing , as the others from their low ones . Surely I am done . The duties that had defined her , all accomplished . Once , she had been her parents ' daughter . Then great , unlucky Ias 's wife . Her children 's mother . At the last , her mother 's keeper . Well , I am none of these things now . Who am I , when I am not surrounded by the walls of my life ? When they have all fallen into dust and rubble ? Well , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that little , secret company left alive , now . That she had made of herself , and that she remained . She leaned between the crenellations again , the stone abrading the lavender sleeves of her court mourning dress , catching at its silk threads . Her eye followed the road in the morning light , starting from the stones below and flowing downhill , through the town , past the river ... and where ? All roads were one road , they said . A great net across the land , parting and rejoining . All roads ran two ways . They said . I want a road that does not come back . A frightened gasp behind her jerked her head around . One of her lady attendants stood on the battlement with her hand to her lips , eyes wide , breathing heavily from her climb . She smiled with false cheer . " My lady . I 've been seeking you everywhere . Do ... do come away from that edge , now ... " Ista 's lips curled in irony . " Content you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Or on any other . Never again . " The gods and I are not on speaking terms . " She suffered the woman to take her arm and stroll with her as if casually along the battlement toward the inner stairs , careful , Ista noted , to take the outside place , between Ista and the drop . Content you , woman . I do not desire the stones . I desire the road . The realization startled , almost shocked her . It was a new thought . A new thought , me ? All her old thoughts seemed as thin and ragged as a piece of knitting made and ripped out and made and ripped out again until all the threads were frayed ... Paladin of Souls
