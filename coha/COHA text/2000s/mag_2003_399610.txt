// This would be the time in my life , I often thought while it went on , that I would remember as the year , or half a year , or fiscal quarter-there was really no telling-when I lived with Martin Gold on Central Park West in Manhattan , and cooked in copper pots and ate on Spode that was figured in blue and maroon , lifting flatware as heavy as fire irons . I said , " I am taking my walking shoes , but you do n't really need to read anything into that . If you did , it would be more about you than me . " He could n't let the statement pass , of course . I knew it when I said it . He would have to answer , and it would tell me more about him . And what he said was , " You ca n't legislate what I understand when you do something , Cara . You take your most important pair of shoes with you when you take off for the weekend , or conceivably for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days ' is what you said ten minutes ago-and it means something . It means something if you go . It means something if you come back pretty soon , and it means something else if you stay there longer . And it means something if you take your brown , ugly , scuffed-up , brokendown , walked-out walking shoes with the extra-wide toe box and the fat yellow trail-boot laces . " One of the reasons I was drawn to Martin was his ability to sometimes talk his way out of trouble and , almost as often , back into it , and then to deny that there had been trouble in the first place . He was a shortorder orator , with a limited but interesting menu . He could whip it up and dish it out : nasty sentences , or elegant and generous paragraphs , and , not infrequently , small , desperately seasoned speeches of uncertain intent . It was possible , I thought , that we had lived together in his Aunt Susan 's vacant apartment too long . We had lived together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of as so long . On the other hand , we had lived together , as he had put it , only a little more than a month , not long enough to know how we felt , and anyway it was my parents ' dilemma more than my own , he suspected , that drew me to leave behind what mattered most , or ought to : him . I had started walking in college and I 'd kept on after school . Often , on an afternoon , I hiked up the Upper West Side , for example , toward the northern border of Central Park and then through Spanish Harlem , over to Fifth and down Embassy Row to the fountain at the Plaza , then along Fifty-ninth to Broadway , then over to a place near John Jay where cops who went to school there would sit around with coffee and open notebooks ; I found them touching because they seemed as worried as they were tough , and so , I think I fancied , was I. I wore the same shoes I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which had been restitched , the lugs replaced once , the laces three times . The walking kept my weight down , my eyes open , and my endorphins up . I worked alone , in other words , at turning myself on , and why , Marty wondered , did I need to ? " And you might ask yourself , " he said next , after commenting on the aesthetic disgrace of my walking shoes , " why you need to walk so much . Charles Dickens sometimes walked twenty-five miles a night . But that was in London . And he was neurotic . It 's crazy to walk so much . And , anyway , he was a genius . " " It 's a dark and stormy night , " ' I said , accurately if weather was the subject . " Disraeli , " he said . I raised my brows and said nothing . He loved it when I did that . " A different writer , " he said , " who is never , ever , confused with Dickens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's from a Peanuts cartoon . " He slowly shook his head , expressing pity with his wide , astonished eyes , and then disgust with his very terrific broad mouth . " Not even A Tale of Two Cities ? Come on , Cara . " " No , " I said . " We were supposed to read it for English in high school , but I saw the movie on TV . It was a far better thing than reading it . " " Far , far better thing . Come to think of it , there 's a hell of a lot of walking in that book . " " And there 's probably an even chance that whoever lived with Dickens did n't give him grief about his shoes . Or even his walking , maybe . " " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't know . " " That 's a good start . It 's the third thing you 've admitted to not knowing since I moved into Aunt Susie 's place . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was already bending back the upraised fingers of my left hand with my right forefinger . " One : Marty , are you sure the F train does n't stop at Bergen Street ? ' Two : " I can really take these Percodan with a bottle and a half of wine ? ' ' " " Your heart did not stop beating , " he said . " You felt like it stopped , but it did n't . You fainted because you had n't eaten . And your tooth was abscessed . And you were tired . " " And my heart stopped beating , " I said . " You think I would n't notice a little absence like that ? My own heartbeat ? Marty : my own . " " That is so pedagogical , " he said . " I 'll be back in a couple of days . Or maybe a little more . I 'll let you know . " " You 're driving on a night like this ? " " Say it , Marty . " " A fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is 3:15 of a sour Saturday afternoon , " I said . " It 'll hardly be night when I get there . And do n't read so much into the walking shoes . I was afraid you would . " " You were hoping I would , " he said , beginning to look like a sulky , adolescent version of a thirty-fouryear-old Legal Aid attorney with no parents , a generous , wealthy aunt who traveled most of every year , and a girlfriend with exceptional leg muscles who wrote cooking columns for newspapers , magazines , and the Web . I kissed him on the cheek beside his mouth . I kissed him on the upper lip and nibbled it . I nibbled on the lower lip . I squeezed his not entirely firm belly . " Thank you for letting me take her car , " I said . " And thanks for sitting around to wait and see if you come back ? " " I have to come back , " I said . " I 'm leaving my stuff here as hostage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be around to see what I do . " I could n't say the part about coming back or not . " Great , " he said , " consider me consoled . " Then he said , " You 're not leaving your terrible shoes here , though . I 'm going to think about them . " His next words would be " day and night . " He opened his mouth , but I was out the door . My parents lived upstate , 200 miles north of the city , and that was where I was headed in Aunt Susan 's large , old , shiny dark-green Mercury . It waddled softly , and you aimed it more than drove . I listened to a Pink Floyd retrospective until I was on the Palisades Parkway , still for much of its length a road that was narrow , with handsome , tended plantings that always made me think of 1940 , a year I knew next to nothing about except that both my parents had been born in it . y mother was trying to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very slowly , around the kitchen  --  her kitchen , I kept reminding myself  --  looking through heaps of mail and magazines and bills , examining recipes on her corkboard over one of the counters , sweeping salt or bread crumbs or garlic skins off a cutting board and into my palm . I should be looking at her face , I thought , to memorize it , or to understand its expression . I ought to be communicating , with my own expression , so that I was not the neurotic daughter descending with her infamous rigidity into their-could you still call it middle age ? Was sixty-two the middle of anything ? Were they old enough for me to call them-at least behind their backs-old ? " Wait , Mom . Wait . What did you say ? " I said . " He left you what ? " " It was a note . Thumbtacked to the whatever you call it that 's the wood at the top of a door . The jamb . " " Is n't that the wood at the side ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway-sweetie , listen-at the top of the door to our bedroom , there was a note from your father . It was hanging there . " " On the jamb , if that 's what it 's called . Is lintel a better word for it ? Or could it be the architrave ? " " Sweetie , do n't be ridiculous . This is about something funny . And it was very funny . When I told him so-this was later on-when I told him , he said , What did I call myself ? The Rememberer ? ' In fact , " my mother said , " he 'd printed out , This Is The Reminder Reminding You . ' It was about something to pick up when I went to town . And I told him , Oh . I do n't remember . I did n't see it that clearly . I did n't have my glasses on . ' And we looked at each other , in this mutual silly fog of forgetting and nearsightedness , and we both began to laugh . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as our first joint joke about getting ... on . " I smiled and nodded , but I wanted to cry . I 'm afraid my expression said so . " What , sweetie ? What 's wrong ? " I shook my head and smiled what Marty once described as my blackand-white-movie heroine 's smile : she knows that the last chance is gone , but the hero has n't seen that yet . " Are you having a bad time with your Marty ? " I shrugged . My mother came across the kitchen to me and opened her arms , and I , who had come to be her harbor , headed in and docked , face in her shoulder and arms around her waist so that she could wrap her own around my back and hug . Her tending made me brave . I said , " How is it with Daddy and you ? " " We 're okay , " she said . " His health could be better . I guess everyone 's could be . Not that he takes it easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bought a new ax by mail from some company in New York . He cuts a lot of kindling , but he does n't do much cordwood splitting anymore . " We stepped back from each other , releasing each other , as if care were a kind of shackling . She removed her glasses , wiped her eyes , smiled , shook her head , and put her glasses back on . They magnified her very dark eyes and made her seem frail . She raised her brows , and I felt my own go up in response . She was pretty , and , except for some white streaks , her hair was still the light brown it had been in my childhood . She was half an inch taller than I , and she looked slender and strong in my father 's Black Watch  --  plaid flannel shirt worn with the tails out and the baggy sleeves rolled up . Her neck was a mess of cords and wrinkled skin ; it was where she looked oldest , and she saw me study it . She lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment . I said , " Daddy sounds-upset . Sometimes , on the phone , he sounds sad . Would that be a fair way to say it ? " She was pouring coffee beans into the little grinder , then filling the kettle , taking a filter from the drawer she had always kept them in , and I suspected that all the motions of this routine provided her with someplace to hide . When she was done , she turned to me . " Yes . " " Yes ? " " A fair way to say it , as long as you are n't saying it to him . All right ? He noticed , suddenly , that he 's a good distance from young . He did this before . " " I remember . Forty . " " No . That would n't be your father . He did it his own way , which was to not even care about turning forty . Or he pretended not to care . If he did , he completely fooled me . But when he turned forty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was miserable for months . " " He tortured you , " I said . " He did not torture me . He was unhappy . " " He snarled . He growled at you . I remember , Mom . It was unbearable . " " It was not unbearable . I bore it . Do you say " bore " for that ? I think so . I handled it . I dealt with it . It became all right . You know , I sometimes still want a cigarette . If I could have a cigarette with this cup of coffee , I think I would really enjoy it . Do not , Cara , open your mouth and tell me not to smoke . Do n't . " " I 'm becoming a pain in the ass again . " " Not you . But do n't manage me right now , sweetie , is all . " " Not me , " I said . I know that I blushed . She was able to make me blush more than men could . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant . And so was my father . My brother , Douglas , was in charge of his own particle accelerator in Seattle . But Jessica Terranova was the champion at understanding directions that came with complex machines and at puzzling people out . She had been a social worker in Utica , but she could also , if she 'd wanted , have been the head of , say , the Food and Drug Administration . " And do n't , please , give me a tip about placing eggshells in the bottom of the coffee pot or anything . " " That 's a household-management tip from a hundred years ago , Mom . I write about cooking . I am being a pain in the ass , though . " " You might become one . You came up here with either saving me or saving Daddy in mind . Or getting saved . I 'm all right about saving someone . I 'm the lifeguard type . Parents get trained to do that . But I have to admit how terrible I am at getting saved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's from your father 's father . He was a lifeguard at Coney Island . The oldest , sexiest lifeguard of his time , according to Daddy . Until he was fired for playing house while someone almost drowned . " " Playing house ' ' ? " " I think you know what I mean . " " Well . Making out ? Screwing teenage girls ? Feeling up the over-fifty set ? Was Queen Victoria still alive ? " " That would be in England , Cara . " " It was a dark and stormy night , " ' I recited . We drank coffee and talked about bone mass in middle-aged women , and then , just a little , about living with someone as a way of figuring out whether or not to live with them . The family eyebrows rose and fell , and we moved on from coffee to chilled vermouth . I made a marinade of white wine , olive oil , marjoram , and redpepper flakes for the swordfish my mother had defrosted , and I was cooking us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home from his hospital . " What kind of job gets you home at nine at night ? " he asked . " The younger doctors get home on time . To hell with it . I 'm going to retire . " " Good , " I said , " you 're getting old . " " You sound like Mom , " he said , hugging me , kissing me on the mouth and once on each cheek and then hugging me again . " I 'm glad you 're here . " " Is something wrong ? " " Yes . My daughter grew up , my son moved to a different time zone , my wife does n't treat me with respect , and my physicians ' patients consistently refuse to send in their stool  --  sample cards . " " No bowel jokes , " my mother warned . His five-o'clock shadow was graywhite , and his skin seemed pale . I thought I could smell hospital soap on him , and ink , both of which I probably imagined . He spent most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be late , " he said . " Half the staff 's been sick or on vacation . A nurse retired and another went into private service . And we have a genuine money hemorrhage . Do I have time for a drink ? " My mother pointed to the glass of red wine she 'd set on the table . He pointed to his mouth , and she walked over to kiss him . He hugged her and patted her bottom . They stayed like that , and I turned away to work the galette onto a dinner plate so I could flip it over back into the pan . The swordfish steaks were in the broiler , and I instructed myself to remember to buy them a nonstick pan with ridges so they could grill on top of the stove . " Cara , " my father said , after drinking a little of his wine , " what brings our far-flung correspondent home ? " " It 's been a while , Daddy . " " True . But ? " " Why now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attorney-at-law ? Is he a reason ? " " Marty 's a reason . " " It 's not working out for you down there , up in the aunt 's penthouse ? " " Not a penthouse , Daddy . Just a big apartment . Very big . God . You could have an overnight for a Girl Scout troop in the living room . The piano is long enough to use as a tugboat . I will never live like that again in my life . " I turned to see him looking into his wine . I 'd have bet that he was imagining me in a bathrobe , walking down a long , carpeted hall from the shower to a vast and opulent bedroom . He slowly shook his head . " And Lawyer Gold ? " " He 's a sweetheart , " I said . " Otherwise , I would n't have moved in with him . Otherwise , I would n't stay . " " I 'm sure that 's true , " he said . " Of course , since it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with him could be enough to force you to stay . If anyone were to try to analyze anyone else , or understand their motivations , et cetera . Instead of shutting up and drinking their wine . " He took a sip . Because my mother had n't shut him up while she was making the salad , I knew that she was thinking something similar . So , of course , was I. We drank the jug wine that tasted like mothballs in vinegar and we ate swordfish , galette , and green salad , and there was a lot of banter I was happy to hear again from my parents . My father looked weary but undefeated , and , as he stood , he seemed powerful again . I became so tired from the drive , and , I suppose , from what had set me traveling , and , more than likely , from being there and with them and feeling-there was no other word for it-safe , that I thought I would sleep where I sat . You came home , at my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go of what you gripped and steered while you were away from them . Not knowing precisely what had really brought me , I closed my eyes and let my hands go loose , and they acted as if it were twenty years before , marching me to the stairs , so that I would go to bed . do n't remember dreams , though I did waken several times , and each time I thought I heard them whispering , first downstairs and then in their bedroom at the other end of the hall . I heard no specific words , but I woke on Sunday morning to remember with certainty that their conversations had been about me . What woke me was the high , loud , ragged voice of Stanley Sobriski-I knew it at once-as he called to my father , who probably stood two feet away from him , as if they were separated by half of the hayfield back behind the house that Sobriski paid my parents in order to cut and bale for his dairy herd . " Honest ta God , Docta Terranova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta God ! " I was glad for the hubbub , because it kept me from reexamining my childhood room and permitting or even requiring a sentimentality I had no patience for . I was too old for it , and so were my parents . And Stanley Sobriski , I knew , was behind in his payments again . He lived five or six miles down the road and across a county highway on a steep hillside where he kept what my father had described as a tilted farm on which the cattle stood crookedly to graze and where the mire and stink of the barnyard had entered the battered , small farmhouse where his tiny wife and illiterate son-he somehow had kept him from school and raised him as an agricultural laborer-lived in the cycle of debt and failure that characterized so many little upstate farms . When I had showered and dressed and come downstairs , my father and Stanley were gone from the house . A small bottle of Scotch stood on the kitchen table , where it caught the morning light and glowed amber . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of Stanley Sobriski 's little wife , in a smelly , dark kitchen , tying the bow . My mother stared at it from where she stood , at the sink , with a spatula in her hand . " Are you making pancakes ? " " No . Would you like some ? " " What are you cooking ? " " Nothing , " she said . " Why ? " I pointed at the spatula . " Oh . Oh , I think I picked it up because it was the nearest weapon . I thought they were going to have a fight . Your father kept rubbing his arm , it got so bad between them . " " What 's wrong with his arm ? " " It 's where people his age rub themselves when their hearts-it 's angina , sweetie . It radiates from the chest . You know . " " Daddy ? " " You push a hospital against the tide all day , that 's what happens . The tension gets to your heart . His father had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worried . " " Well , of course it 's right to be worried . " The structure of her face collapsed then , into vertical lines , horizontal wrinkles , loose flesh , red skin , and those eyes that her glasses seemed at times to enlarge so grotesquely . I had absolutely not a word in mind with which to comfort her , or comfort myself , or simply break the silence that seemed to harden and to separate us . She was alone on her side of it , I imagined , sensing her loss of him and the beginning of a fierce , long loneliness . And then it all fell back into place , and she was my powerful mother . But I had seen who she was when she was in her privacy . She would be far from pleased that I had . She shook her head . " He 's lucky I did n't take him apart with my spatula , " she said , tossing it into the sink . " Stanley 's not paying ? " I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnnie Walker Red . And honest  --  ta-God , Docta Terranova , this year he 's going to pay . Just forgive him for not paying over the last three years and let him start cutting today . You know what he 's like . " " He 's a deadbeat , " I said . " He is . " " And Daddy 's a pussycat . " " Until he told Stanley about sound business practices , and Stanley said then how come he 's driving the hospital into the ground and everybody who goes there gets sicker on account of Daddy not buying the necessary equipment , and your father grabbed his arm and started that very low city-Italian muttering he does when he 's crazy with anger . " " Is he having some kind of attack ? " " If he 's dead next time we see him , then probably he was . " " You 're so tough , " I said , watching her keep her face composed . " That 's where you get it from , sweetie . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " On pulpy white bread , please , with ketchup . " " Shall I make more coffee ? " " I think chocolate milk , " I said . But she did n't go to the refrigerator for eggs . She wore dark clogs and her own faded jeans and a different one-Stewart , I think was the plaid-of his long-tailed flannel shirts that was open enough for me to see how the edges of her breasts had gone crepey . It was like old lovers , I thought , her exposed like that and me noticing . I remembered how smooth her chest had looked , how tight her breasts had seemed to me when I was trying , through prayer and manipulation , to coerce my own to grow . She leaned against the stove and yoked her hand 's webbing , from thumb to forefinger , against her own throat , as if compelling herself to stand still . She said , " I worry about him every day . I do n't think there are any hours anymore when I do n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It 's so stupid . We 're together so much , and you know what we do ? We worry about each other dying and the other ending up alone . So we do that , and of course it creeps into the being together . Every time there 's light , we make it dark . We admitted it one night . He got home on time , and we drank too much wine with dinner and we said things . These are n't things you and Marty Gold would be saying , I hope . " I shook my head . She did n't see me . " This is precisely what I made myself promise I would n't say to you when you told us you were coming home . " " It 's why I came . " " Sweetie , that 's terrible . You should n't have to come home like we 're dying and you need to comfort us and see to our medication . You ought to be able to come home because life is miserable for you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . It was real laughter , and I enjoyed hearing it . " I 'm a little miserable , " I said . " Good girl , " she said . " Thank you . " I nodded , and then she did . " So I ca n't help , " I said . " You always help . Come be here with us once in a while . That 's lovely . There 's no real helping what I 'm talking about . It 's like the ocean , only slower . It comes in . " " We need Grandpa Terranova , if we could pry him away from the hotly-totsy girls at Coney Island . " My father , coming into the kitchen , said , " Why ? " " Tide 's up , " my mother said . " How are the local relationships ? " " He did n't punch me out when I insulted him . So I 'm still the lord of the manor . " " And he hates us , " my mother said . " That he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your favors for feeding his family . They always hate you if they need you to be good to them . And I was trying to be bad . " " Did you fire him , Daddy ? Or whatever you do to tenant farmers . Is he a tenant farmer ? " He shook his big head . He wore an old crewneck sweater of a peculiar mud-green color that made the skin of his face and even his wrists and fingers look gray . I watched my mother 's dark eyes on him . " Nothing that grand , " he said . " He 's supposed to pay us a few dollars a bale . Windrows , they call them now : those giant wheels of hay they wrap in white plastic and litter the world with after they unwrap them for the herd . He 's supposed to make it grow " - he gestured toward the large field behind the house- " without putting toxic chemicals into the groundwater . " " He has n't paid in years , " my mother said . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field anyway , we 'd just as soon do without his tractor going back and forth all day on the way to and from the field . And God knows what kind of deadly stuff he 's put into the ground . Let 's have it quiet again , we thought . That 's what Daddy told him this morning , when he came with his little bottle of whiskey and his excuses about paying . " My father sat to drink the coffee my mother offered , but he only held the cup in the air , away from the saucer but also away from his mouth . " I told him he could take any bales he 'd cut last year , but that I did n't want him cutting any more . " " So he 's gone ? " I asked , sipping coffee I did n't want . " No , he 's up there , being sly . He 'll take any bales he finds , for sure . And maybe he 'll cut more . It 's a fine summer day . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hike across from the access road just to catch him in the act . " " No , " my mother said . " No ? " he said . " Why not ? " " Because it 's Sunday , and Cara 's home , and I 'd just as soon you did n't throw an embolism or blow your heart through your chest and spoil her weekend with us . " " Medical talk , " he said to me , jerking his thumb at her . " Ask her what an embolism is . " " Not me , " I said . " I do n't want to know . Anyway , if you kick off , I wo n't be able to solicit your advice . " He leaned back in his chair and put the coffee down . My mother said , " Did you really want eggs ? " I shook my head . " Because you do look very pale , " she said . " Mommy , I never get pale . " " Are you sick ? " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply him with words : Loveless . Pregnant . Fettered by despair . " I 'm not sure , " I said , " about living with Marty too much longer . " " Is that a dilemma ? " my father asked . " You mean a choice I ca n't make ? " He shrugged . " I do n't know what I mean , " he said . " I never lived with anybody except your mother . She didn't- " He looked up . " Yes , you did , " he said . She shook her head . " You told me no , but I always wondered about the Frenchman . A hockey pro , a semi-professional hockey player ? In Utica . Before us . Le-something . Leblanc . " " Lafleur , " she said . " Mommy . " " We never lived together in the same apartment or house or anything . " She looked pleased by her recollection .. " I told you the truth . " He said , " But you maybe also lied a little ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't be silly , " she said . " His family had a camp up north , in the Adirondacks , near one of the lakes . We stayed there a couple of times . " She turned to look out the kitchen window . My father and I were staring at her shoulders and buttocks and back . I wondered what he was thinking while I considered how she might have lain beneath a broad , tall hockey player who , even as they celebrated his power , was losing his career . I thought of Marty as he sat in his plaid boxer shorts and knee-length businessman 's socks studying the laws of New York State while he dressed to go to one of two courtrooms where he waited to be necessary to people who were poor and accused . He was a lovely man , and bright , and he had done his share of scuffling in the tougher precincts of the city . I was going to write a column , I thought , when I got back , about pasta puttanesca . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do for early summer . I wanted , just then , to write only about the food of people who lived as close to the bone as Stanley Sobriski , and cooks consulting my column would learn " whore 's pasta " garlic and capers , tomatoes , Nicoise olives and anchovy fillets , oregano and red-pepper flakes . With puttanesca , you think you 're getting an everyday sauce , but then you 're surprised . The intensity of the silence between my parents increased . When my mother said , " He was a nice boy . He was gentle , which you would n't expect when you looked at him , " and when my father turned toward her but said nothing , I excused myself and went upstairs for my walking shoes . I brushed my teeth and came down to an empty kitchen in which dishes left on the table , and chairs pulled away from it , suggested interruptions and necessities . I put a banana in the hip pocket of my jeans , and I went out the back door , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their hooks , to walk across the back field that had put Stanley Sobriski into debt and my father into such discomfort . I had n't walked across this field for years-across the marshy ground on its way down into a creek and then up , across more marsh , and then higher , quite steeply , until the ground hardened and curved to a kind of plateau that went on for acres to the hedgerow that marked the end of my parents ' holding . It was wet walking at first , but I did n't mind . My shoes were waterproofed , and because I was wearing them I felt canny and adequate . When I was a girl , I used to follow the stream down to a basin of land where I had dammed the flow and had created my own small lake . It was important to call it my own , and my father had agreed that I could , if I made a spillway with my fieldstone dam that would direct the slow trickle away from the lower edge of their gardens below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking against the steepness of the hill . I could hear my breaths , and I realized that I had forced my breathing into something of the familiar rhythm of Marty and me as we panted together on his generous aunt 's walnut sleigh bed . Well , did n't you get to me , I said as if to Marty . And are n't you surprised , I heard as if in his voice . The slope of the hill must have been interrupting the sound that I suddenly heard when I was walking almost on the level , forcing my way through the tall , tender grass that had grown higher than my elbows . I saw that a man  --  Stanley Sobriski , I was certain , hunched and round with muscle , taut with purpose , on top of his blue tractor-was cutting hay . The blades spun clean and powerfully , and the grass was flung behind him with a sure , organized heaviness . I thought of my father , rubbing his left arm as he and Stanley argued about the word given and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainties that surpassed their words : Stanley the hungers of his bony cattle , and the land , growing unavailable , that was all that he in his debt could rely upon to lighten the debt ; and my father feeling in his chest and arm the sense , I had read , of being crushed . Stanley saw me as I stood in the tall , uncut grass , and he did something terrible . He had been cutting in rows that more or less followed the contours of the hill . Seeing me , he had slowed , and then he 'd sped up . He drove toward me against the grain of the hillside , violating the shape the swaths should have made . He tore the field apart as he drove to me . It was a defilement , a punishing of the order that emanated from the farmhouse to the owners ' field . And it frightened me . He stopped the tractor a safe-you could even say a polite-distance from me , and he left the motor idling . He stayed that way awhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stink of diesel fuel or something else in the air , while I squinted into the late-morning sun . Finally , he shut the tractor off and came down the slope through the grass , which came almost to his shoulders . He stood before me , his curly red hair stippled with bits of stem and leaf , his white teeth exposed in what he might have thought of as a smile . " I ai n't seen you for a long time , " he shouted , though we were only a few feet apart . He wore a stained rust-colored cotton shirt , its sleeves rolled high . Bits of grass were tangled in the light hairs on his forearms . " Honest ta God , you grew up good . " I said , " Hi , " and then said what I thought , and what I thought I perhaps should n't say . But I was thinking of my father and the pressure in his chest . I was thinking of my mother 's face when it fell . I said , " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He sent you ? " I shook my head . Then I decided to say , " Never mind who sent me , please . Are you ? " " Am I what , Miss Landlord ? " " Supposed to be cutting ? " His eyes shifted from side to side , not engaging mine . They were cruel , like a clown 's , when they finally fell upon my face and locked still , and he smiled without pleasure . " Sure . He said , your old man said : Go up there and finish it off . " At 's all I 'm doin " here . I 'll be outa here , a couple hours , you wo n't know you saw me . Whaddya say ? " " I think what I should say is no . So : no , Mr. Sobriski . My parents do n't want you cutting on their property . " I thought I sounded pompous . I thought I sounded arrogant . I thought of his wife in their dark kitchen . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally looking at me . He did n't seem to me , anymore , to be a clown . He looked like a man who was going to punch someone . I was one of you people , and you people were the ones who needed a little smacking around , and that 's why I jumped and gave a timid little hiccup of fear as his hands came out very quickly to seize my shoulders . I felt his fingers against the bone . " Payments . Installments . Due tomorrow , due today , kindly remit . Kindly fucking remit . " He worked the right shoulder backward , then forward , then backward again . He did the same with the left . I tried to pull away from him , but of course I could n't . He was powerful , and his bulk was immovable . He was going to set me down in the tall grass , where we 'd be invisible , and he was going to furrow and reap . Instead of practicing one of the veteran city woman 's surefire maneuvers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knuckles of the clenched hand ; swift knee to the groin ; finger in the eye and not relenting no matter what until the eyeball 's out of its socket ; knuckles of second and third finger , repeatedly , hard into the larynx ; high-pitched scream for assistance ; stab at the heart with an unpeeled banana-I closed my eyes and I choked back my weeping . He let go of my shoulders , and I heard the grass whisper against him , so I opened my eyes . It was my mother , of course , holding before her with both hands what seemed to be a smallish ax with a long steel head . That , I guessed , would be my father 's new kindling ax . She said , in what I suppose was the toughest voice of Utica , New York , " You want to fight , Stanley ? You want to try something with my kid ? " " Hi , Mommy . " " What did you think you were doing ? " " No , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that , " she said , as she had so many times in my childhood when I had trespassed or strayed and had needed her help . " Hey , missus , " Stanley said , " honest ta God , I was just-I think I lost my composza . This morning with the doctor , that was bad for everybody . But no harm intended , unnerstand ? " " I 'm going to the state police , " my mother said . " We 're going . We 're filing a report on you . Attempted- " and she could n't say the word . " I 'll go to the sheriff too . I wo n't leave you alone after this . " She lifted the ax , as if she expected him to jump and run . He did neither . He looked at her and then at me . He lifted his face so that his nostrils were pointed toward us . He breathed in deeply , as if he could distinguish our scent , on the breezes in the field , from the smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the grass , which closed behind him , and then he was on his blue tractor , and then he was driving-still mowing , tearing the field apart-as he went toward the access road at the far western edge . I sat down where I 'd stood . My mother sat beside me , her eyes closed , her head shaking a little , though she did n't weep . " You were going to chop up weeds ? " " I took the ax with me because I thought maybe if he could n't find his new toy , he 'd skip cutting kindling we do n't need . What we need is for him to rest . " " What were you coming out here for ? " " I wanted to talk with you . You had that look you used to get as a kid , all taut lips and grim eyes : Cara moving toward something inadvisable . I wanted to talk to you before you got there . " " I did n't know you saw me , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure things out . That was all it was . " She let her breath out noisily . She fiddled with a leather thong attached to the handle of the ax . " Things with Marty Gold ? " " Him . Daddy . You . What kind of food stuff I should write about when I get back . I was n't looking for trouble . God , he was so angry . I think he would have done it . " " I think he would have done it , " she said . " That , and stealing hay , maybe watching Daddy have a heart attack-what else could he have done ? But what about Daddy and me-what you were trying to figure out . " " How to handle missing you . " " Come home more . Or we could visit you down there . It might be good if I could get him out of town more often . " " Not that kind of missing , " I said . " The kind where you miss people sort of in advance . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the pale wood of the ax handle . She shook her head and said , " That . " She hefted the ax , then set it down on the crushed grass . " No , " she said , " I do n't know anything smart about that kind . No . " " No , " I said , " I do n't either . " We sat in the clearing we 'd made with our bodies , surrounded by high grass , while the sun rose to noon . Birdsong came in , and the hunting cry  --  that half-whispered menace-of a hawk too high to be seen . " I 'm betting that you did n't sublet your place , " my mother said . " Am I right ? So you 'd have someplace to go back to ? " I smiled for her certainty . " You 'll leave him , " she said . Her glasses were off , and she was rubbing her eyes . She looked up , and each of us knew she was exposed to the other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I untied each yellow lace and then tied each knot again . " Well , of course . " She replaced her glasses . " Of course . " She stood , a little stiffly , holding the ax at her side , and she reached down for my hand . I pulled against her to stand . Her grip was dry and powerful . " And then we get all the scaring we always were right to be scared of , " she said .
