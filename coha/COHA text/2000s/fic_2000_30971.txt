Chapter One : Heaven In Heaven there are 1,637 steps from my house to the Western Union . You have to walk by a playground and four stores  --  two clothing , one food , and one hardware coffee shop . After you pass those stores , you cross one street and hop over a deadly looking grate . ( I once heard about a man who got struck by lightning while standing on one . ) Ten steps past the grate is Ma 's Superette . ( If you ca n't find it at Ma 's ... she even sells live bait on the side . ) Ma 's Superette is open 23 1/2 hours a day . Ma closes it from 4:10 A.M. to 4:40 A.M. every morning . She uses the half hour to pray . At least that 's what she says she uses it for . When I said differently one day Pops said I was skeptical and not spiritual at all . That made me mad ' cause had n't I put all my allowance in the Salvation Army kettle last winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even said a while ago that because I was just fourteen I did n't understand about life , but I was n't about to hear that . Sometimes he gets so mad at me , he just shakes his head and mumbles that I 'm just like Uncle Jack . Then he tosses the thought away I guess and smiles at me , every time . Anyway , Ma 's was the place you could get nachos and nail polish , Levi 's when you needed them , and flip-flops for the summer . I 'd already gone through two pair and it 's only the middle of June . Heaven might sound pretty boring to most people , but before I really understood about all my years at the Western Union , it was fine for a girl like me . I do n't get sent to Ma 's for bread and milk like most kids , but to wire money . I 've been doing it ever since I 've been allowed to leave the yard by myself . It 's something I thought most kids did . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that made me different from every other kid in Heaven .
