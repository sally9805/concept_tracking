August 9 , 1979 <p> Alleged air-conditioning , " said Darius Fox . " What 's your take , John Jasper ? Motor pool morons set us on bake or broil ? " <p> Jack Reed laughed and used a meaty , freckled forearm to clear sweat from his face . Scanning the night-darkened Dumpsters and butt-sides of shuttered , low-rent businesses that lined the alley , he sucked on his Parliament and blew smoke out the cruiser 's window as Darius kept the car moving forward at ten mph . <p> Ten years ago , to the day , the Manson Family had butchered Sharon Tate and a whole bunch of other people . If either Fox or Reed was aware of the anniversary , neither thought it worth mentioning . <p> Crazy Charlie 's crimes might as well have been on another planet ; big-ticket outrage on high-end real estate . Fox and Reed 's Southwest Division shifts were filled with nonstop penny-ante crap that sometimes blossomed into stomach-churning violence . Reality that never made the papers because , as far as they could see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Man , it 's a steam bath . " <p> Reed said , " Alleged , as in this is a motor vehicle . More like a shopping cart with a cherry on top . " <p> Fox had prepped for driving the way he usually did , hand-vacuuming the driver 's portion of the bench seat , then wiping the steering wheel down with his private bottle of Purell . Now it was his own sweat coating the plastic . " Hand me a tissue , J.J. " <p> Reed complied and his partner rubbed the wheel till it squeaked . Both men continued to study the alley as they crawled . Nothing . Good . One half of the shift had passed . <p> Jack Reed said , " Alleged , as in Jimmy Carter 's a commander in chief . " <p> " Now you 're getting unpleasantly political . " <p> " That 's a problem ? " " Night like this it is . " <p> " Truth is truth , Darius . It was Peanut Boy helped that loony towel-head back into Eye-Ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No debate on Farmer Bucktooth being a nitwit , John Jasper . I just do n't want to pollute our precious time together with small things like international affairs . " <p> Reed thought about that . " Fair enough . " <p> " I 'm known for my fairness . " <p> Slow shift ; the usual drunk and disorderlies at Mexican dance halls on Vermont , a couple of false-alarm burglary calls , an assortment of miscreants warned and released because none of them was worth the paperwork . <p> The last call they 'd fielded before embarking on alley-duty was yet another noise complaint at a USC fraternity , already taken care of by the campus rent-a-cops by the time Fox and Reed arrived . Rich , confident college boys saying yessir and nossir , scooping up beer bottles from the lawn , hurrying inside to continue the merriment . Wink wink wink . <p> Reed smoked his Parliament down to a shred , pinched it cold between his fingers , flicked the remnant out the window . He was a ruddy , blond fireplug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscled pounds , thirty but looking older , with skin leathered by the sun and a nose flattened by high school football . A hay-colored crewcut topped his bullet skull . A naturally grainy voice was coarsened further by two packs a day . <p> Three years out of the service , all his time spent running an armory in Germany . <p> He said , " Tell you what alleged is , Darius : L.A. nights cooling off . Night like this , might as well have stayed in Bull Shoals . " " And missed the opportunity to ride with me ? " <p> Reed grinned . " Perish the thought . " <p> " Damn heat , " said Fox , dabbing sweat from his straight-edge mustache . He was a tall , rangy black man , thirty-one years old , a former air force mechanic who 'd been told by many people that he was handsome enough to act . <p> Jack Reed , a small-town Arkansas boy , was comfortable with black people in a way northerners could never be . He found L.A. scary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anger . <p> Working with a black man-sitting side by side , eating , talking , trusting your life to a black man-was a whole different level of comfort for a transplanted southerner , and he was surprised how fast he 'd gotten used to riding with Darius . <p> Knowing what Darius was thinking without Darius having to put it into words . <p> He could only imagine what his cousins would say if he bothered to talk to them anymore , which he did n't . All that ignorance and stupidity was history . <p> He contemplated another cigarette as Darius exited the alley , drove a block , entered a neighboring back lane . More garbage and accordion-grated rear doors . <p> Same old same old ; both patrolmen were bored and crazy-hot . <p> Darius used his forearm to wipe sweat off his chin . Shiny nails flashed . Jack resisted the urge to kid his partner about the weekly manicures . Night like this , no sense being tiresome . <p> Jack had been to Darius 's neat little bungalow in Crenshaw for barbecues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made chitchat with the woman Darius was supposed to be committed to till death do us . <p> Madeleine Fox was a small-waisted , curvy , strong-featured white girl who thought she was an artist but had no talent anyone else could perceive . Great teeth and hair , even better body . Those big soft ... Jack imagined Darius getting close to her . Sliding down the bed and putting his manicured hands on ... Jack 's own face and body and hands transferred to the scene . <p> Feeling like a shit , he shut down the movie , lit up another Parliament . <p> " You okay ? " said Darius . <p> " Yeah . " <p> " You got fidgety . Pumping those knees , like you do . " <p> " I 'm fine . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " Okay , what ? " <p> " You fidget when something 's bugging you . " <p> " Nothing 's bugging me . " <p> " Okay . " <p> Jack said , " All that intuition , apply for detective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sitting on my ass all day typing , no more stimulating conversation with you ? Not to mention fringe benefits ? " <p> Jack had been riding with Darius for thirteen months , knew the perks his partner was talking about . Comped meals , " donations " of merchandise by grateful civilians . <p> Last week , both he and Darius had gotten brand-new pocket calculators from an Arab with a store on Hoover after they 'd busted two kids trying to shoplift cassette tapes . <p> Darius 's favorite perk had nothing to do with tangible goods . <p> Police groupies . Hit the right cop bar at the right time and they swarmed like ants on molasses . Sad girls , for the most part , not Jack 's thing . But he did n't judge . <p> Sometimes he wondered , though . Darius married to a good-looking , downright sexy girl like Maddy , nice backyard , cute little Aaron . <p> Jack ever got married , he was pretty sure he 'd never step out . <p> Sometimes he thought about Maddy , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought on headaches and long , itchy thoughts . Mostly when his crappy little single in Inglewood got real quiet and Penthouse was n't gon na cut it . <p> Darius said , " Wind blows the heat in , then the heat just sits down and stays until another wind finally decides to kick its ass out of town . " <p> Jack said , " Tonight 's weather report is brought to you by Cal Worthington Dodge . Now for the latest on them Dodgers . " <p> Darius laughed . " Nasty night like this , almost a full moon on top of the heat , you 'd think we 'd be having more fun . " <p> " People carving each other up , " said Jack . <p> " People shooting each other full of holes , " said Darius . <p> " People stomping each other till the brains ooze out of their cracked skulls . " <p> " People strangling each other till the tongues are sticking out like limp ... salamis . " <p> " For a moment I thought you were gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Pointing up the alley to a big white car idling , maybe ten yards up , pulled to the left . Lights off but the security bulb of a neighboring building cast an oblique band of yellow across the vehicle 's rear end . <p> Darius said , " Caddy , looks pretty new . How come it 's smoking worse than you ? " <p> He rolled closer and each of them made out the model . <p> Big white Fleetwood , matching vinyl top , fake wire wheels . Tinted windows shut tight . <p> Someone 's A.C. was n't alleged . <p> Darius rolled close enough to read the tags . Jack called in the numbers . <p> One-year-old Caddy , registered to Arpad Avakian , address on Edgemont Street , no wants or warrants . Darius said , " East Hollywood Armenian . Bit of a drive to Southwest . " <p> Jack said , " Maybe something worth driving for . " <p> " Real worth driving for . " <p> Both of them thinking the same thing without having to say it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wheels to be in this crap-dump neighborhood in a newish luxury boat unless someone had a serious jones . <p> Dope or sex . <p> Or both . <p> Guy with a fresh Caddy had the potential to be a fun bust , bit of diversion from the brain-dead locals they usually dealt with . <p> If Arpad was polite , they might even let him go with a warning . Some of those Hollywood Armenians owned stereo stores and the like . Nothing wrong with chalking up another grateful civilian . <p> Darius got closer , put the cruiser in Park . Got out of the car before Jack could place his hand on the door handle . <p> Jack watched his partner hitch up his trousers , approach the Caddy with the cop swagger that originated when you learned to walk with all that heavy gear on your belt . Like making your way on the rolling deck of a boat ; eventually , you came to like it . <p> Darius walked right up next to the Caddy , shined his flashlight at the driver 's window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prevent it being grabbed . His free hand hovered near his holstered .38 , and Jack felt his own paw settling on his weapon . Nowadays everything had to be logged , so he called in the stop , caught a bad connection on the radio , tried twice more before reaching Dispatch . <p> Meanwhile , Darius was rapping on the window . <p> Tinted almost black . It stayed closed . <p> " Police , open up . " <p> The Caddy sat there , smoking away . <p> Maybe suicide ? Or a carbon mono accident ? Normally , you had to be in an indoor situation to asphyxiate yourself with exhaust , but Jack had heard about venting gone bad . <p> " Open up now . " Darius put that menacing edge in his voice . You 'd never know this was a guy who loved his weekly salon manicure . <p> The Caddy 's window remained shut . <p> As Darius repeated the command , he reached to unsnap his holster and Jack moved for his own gun and opened the cruiser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , the window slid down silently . <p> Whatever Darius saw relaxed him . He dropped his gun arm . Smiled . Jack relaxed , too . " License and reg- " The night cracked . <p> Three shots in rapid succession . Each hit Darius square in the chest . Each caused him to buck . He did n't fall back the way they did in the movies . He sank down into a sitting position , hands flat on the asphalt , as the Caddy lurched into gear and shot forward . <p> At first glance , just a guy resting . <p> Crazily , Jack thought : He 's okay . <p> Then Darius pivoted , half faced Jack . What looked like motor oil leaked through Darius 's tailored navy shirt . His face was that of a stranger . <p> Jack screamed and fired at the fleeing car . Emptying his revolver as he ran to Darius . <p> " Oh man , oh Jesus , oh man , Lord Jesus . . . " <p> Later , he 'd learn that one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had n't slowed the big car down . Darius continued to sit there . Three wet holes in his chest . <p> Jack cradled him , put pressure on the wounds . " Hold on , Dar , you 're gon na be fine , just hold on hold on hold on . " Darius stared at the sky with dull , sightless eyes . His mouth gaped . <p> Jack felt for a pulse . Gim me something , c'm on , c'm on , gim me ... Darius 's skin turned to ice . <p> Jack began CPR , covering Darius 's cold mouth with his own . <p> Like breathing into an empty cave . Darius lay there . Still as the heat that had blown in from the desert and decided to stay . <p> Chapter Two By now , Aaron Fox understood Mr. Dmitri . <p> Once a level of trust had developed , he 'd stay out of your face . <p> Aaron 's favorite type of client . Real deep pockets made Mr. Dmitri the perfect client . <p> Before his first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Googling Leonid Davidovitch Dmitri and coming up with two dozen hits , the most informative a rags-to-riches tale in a business journal : Moscow born , trained as an electrical engineer , Dmitri had been stuck for fifteen years in a dead-end Communist job measuring noise levels at restaurants and filing reports that never got read . At the age of thirty-seven , he 'd emigrated to Israel , then the U.S. , taught night school math and physics to other Russians , tinkered in his kitchen , inventing numerous objects of dubious value . Ten years ago , he 'd patented a tiny , wafer-thin stereo speaker that produced outsized sound and was perfect for cars-especially high-end sports models with their limited cabin space . <p> Aaron 's Porsche had been outfitted with Dmitri 's gizmo when he 'd had it customized and the fidelity was kick-ass . The article estimated Mr. Dmitri 's net worth at a couple hundred million , and Aaron was expecting to meet some tycoon sitting behind an acre of desk in an over-the-top inner sanctum crammed with imitation FabergT and God knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stubby-limbed , bullnecked man in his late fifties with a pie-tin face blued by stubble , sitting behind a plywood desk in a no-window hole at a factory in a Sylmar industrial park . <p> Dmitri was maybe five five , at least two hundred , lots of that muscle , but also some fat . Dark brown laser-sharp eyes never stopped moving . <p> Two hundred biggies , but the guy was n't spending it on wardrobe . Short-sleeved pale blue shirt , baggy gray pleated pants , gray New Balances . Aaron came to learn that it was Dmitri 's uniform . Cheap digital watch . <p> Fake-o tongue-and-groove covered all four walls of the office . Same for the door , giving the place a claustrophobic feel . That first meeting , he 'd played it safe clothes-wise , not knowing what kind of rapport he 'd have to develop with the client . <p> That kind of individual attention was one of the many keys to Aaron 's success . Variety was what he liked about the job . One day you might be meeting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking he could pull off hip-hop . Chopsticking miso black cod and waiting as the client struggled for nonchalance , inside he 's rotting from insecurity as he fumbles to explain his reason for hiring a detective . Finally the confession : He needs to know , is his twenty-seven-year-old fourth wife blowing the good-looking guy someone saw her with at Fred Segal , or is Darrett really a gay hairdresser she took along as a shopping buddy ? <p> Situation like that , you do n't dress down to the client 's level but you do n't wear a suit . Aaron met the poor fool wearing indigo Diesel jeans , a slate-colored , retro Egyptian cotton T-shirt from VagueLine , unstructured black linen jacket , perforated black Santoni driving shoes . <p> The following day , he was at a downtown law firm , corporate client talking through a **26;1436;TOOLONG mouthpiece , needing someone to check out the goings-on at a Temple Street construction site where tools and building materials were disappearing at an alarming rate . For that one , Aaron chose a navy pin-striped Paul Smith made-to-measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket square , brown kidskin Magli loafers . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
