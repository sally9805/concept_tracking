The Princess Diaries , Volume IV : Princess in Waiting " If I was a princess , " she murmured , " I could scatter largess to the populace . But even if I am only a pretend princess , I can invent little things to do for people . I 'll pretend that to do things for people is scattering largess. " a little princess Frances Hodgson Burnett Thursday , January 1 , Midnight , Royal Genovian bedchamber My New Year 's Resolutions by Princess Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldo , age 14 years and 8 months I will stop biting my fingernails , including the fake ones . I will stop lying . Grandmre knows when I am lying anyway , thanks to my traitorous nostrils , which flare every time I tell a fib , so it 's not like there is even a point in trying to be less than truthful . I will never veer from prepared script while delivering televised address to the Genovian public . I will stop accidentally saying mrde in front of the ladies-in-waiting . I will stop asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear words . I will apologize to the Genovian Olive Growers Association for that thing with the pits . I will apologize to the Royal Chef for slipping Grandmre 's dog that slice of foie gras ( even though I have told the palace kitchen repeatedly that I do not eat liver ) . I will stop lecturing the Royal Genovian Press Corps on the evils of smoking . If they all wish to develop lung cancer , that is their prerogative . I will achieve self-actualization . I will stop thinking so much about Michael Moscovitz . Oh , wait . It 's okay for me to think about Michael Moscovitz , BECAUSE HE IS MY BOYFRIEND NOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! MT + MM = TRUE LOVE 4-EVER Friday , January 2 , 2 p.m. , Royal Genovian Parliament You know , I am supposed to be on vacation . Seriously . I mean , this is my winter break . I am supposed to be having fun , mentally recharging for the coming semester , which is not going to be easy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention Health and Safety class . Everybody at school was all , Oh , you are so lucky , you get to spend Christmas in a castle being waited on hand and foot . Well , first of all , there is nothing so great about living in a castle . Because guess what ? Castles are totally old . And yeah , it 's not like this one was built in 4 a.d. , or whenever it was my ancestress Princess Rosagunde first became ruler of Genovia . But it was still built in , like , the 1600s , and let me tell you what they did n't have in the 1600s : Cable DSL Toilets Which is not to say there is n't a satellite dish now , but , hello , this is my dad 's place ; the only channels he has got programmed are , like , CNN , CNN Financial News , and the golf channel . Where is MTV 2 , I ask you ? Where is the Lifetime Movie Channel for Women ? Not that it matters because I am spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't as if I ever even get a free moment to pick up a remote and go , " Ho hum , I wonder if there 's a Tracey Gold movie on . " Oh , yeah , and the toilets ? Let me just tell you that back in the 1600s , they did n't know so much about sewage . So now , four hundred years later , if you put one square too much toilet paper in the bowl and try to flush , you create a mini indoor tsunami . So that 's it . That is my life in Genovia . Every other kid I know is spending his or her winter break in Aspen skiing , or in Miami getting tanned . But me ? What am I doing for my winter break ? Well , here are the highlights from the new datebook Grandmre gave me for Christmas ( what girl would n't love to get a datebook for Christmas ? ) of what I have done so far : Sunday , December 21 Royal Daily Schedule Arrived in Genovia . Due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barfed on official Genovian welcome committee who came to airport to greet me as I disembarked from the plane . One full day since I last saw Michael . Tried calling him at his grandparents ' house in Boca Raton , where the Moscovitzes have gone for winter break , but no one answered , perhaps because of time difference , Genovia being six hours ahead of Florida . Monday , December 22 Royal Daily Schedule While touring naval cruiser , the Prince Phillipe , tripped over anchor , accidentally knocking Admiral Pepin into the Genovian harbor . He was okay , though . They fished him out with a harpoon . But why am I the only one in this country who thinks pollution is an important issue ? If people are going to dock their yachts in the Genovian harbor , they really ought to pay attention to what they are throwing overboard . I mean , porpoises get their noses stuck in those plastic six-pack holders all the time , and then they starve to death because they ca n't open their mouths to eat . All people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holders out , and everything would be fine . Well , all right , not everything , since you should n't be throwing trash overboard in the first place . I simply can not stand idly by while helpless sea creatures are being abused by a bunch of Bain de Soleil addicts in search of that perfect Saint-Tropez tan . Two days since last saw Michael . Tried calling him twice . First time , no answer . Second time , Michael 's grandmother answered and said I had just missed him , as Michael had gone to the pharmacy to pick up his grandfather 's prescription foot powder . This is so like him , always thinking of others before himself . Tuesday , December 23 Royal Daily Schedule At breakfast with Genovian Olive Growers Association , mentioned unseasonable drought afflicting Mediterranean area must be the " pits . " No one seemed to think this joke particularly amusing , particularly members of Olive Growers Association . Three days since last saw Michael . No time to call due to pit controversy .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
