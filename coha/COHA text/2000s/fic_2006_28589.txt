" We 're here , " Irys said . I looked around . The surrounding jungle bulged with life . Overgrown green bushes blocked our path , vines hung from the tree canopy , and the constant chatter and trill of jungle birds beat at my ears . Small furry creatures , who had been following us through the jungle , peeked at us from their hiding spots behind huge leaves . " Where ? " I asked , glancing at the three other girls . They shrugged in unison , equally confused . In the thick humid air , their thin cotton dresses were soaked in sweat . My own black pants and white shirt clung to my clammy skin . We were tired from lugging our heavy backpacks along snake-thin jungle paths , and itchy from hosting unnameable insects on our skins . " The Zaltana homestead , " Irys said . " Quite possibly your home . " I surveyed the lush greenery and saw nothing that resembled a settlement . During the course of our travels south , whenever Irys had declared that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small town or village , with houses made of wood , stone or brick , hemmed in by fields and farms . The brightly dressed inhabitants would welcome us , feed us and , amid a cacophony of voices and spicy aromas , listen to our story . Then certain families would be summoned with great haste . In a whirlwind of excitement and babble , one of thechildren in our party , who had lived in the orphanage in the north , would be reunited with a family they had n't known existed . As a result , our group had grown ever smaller as we 'd traveled farther into the southern land of Sitia . Soon , we had left the cold northern air far behind , and were now cooking in the steamy warmth of the jungle with no sign of a town in sight . " Homestead ? " I asked . Irys sighed . Wisps of her black hair had sprung from her tight bun , and her stern expression did n't quite match the slight humor in her emerald eyes . " Yelena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your senses , " she instructed . I rubbed my slick hands along the grain of my wooden staff , concentrating on its smooth surface . My mind emptied , and the buzz of the jungle faded as I sent out my mental awareness . In my mind 's eye , I slithered through the underbrush with a snake , searching for a patch of sunlight . I scrambled through the tree branches with a long-limbed animal with such ease that it felt as if we flew . Then , above , I moved with people among the treetops . Their minds were open and relaxed , deciding what to eat for dinner , and discussing the news from the city . But one mind worried about the sounds from the jungle below . Something was n't right . Someone strange was there . Possible danger . Who 's in my mind ? I snapped back to myself . Irys stared at me . " They live in the trees ? " I asked . She nodded . " But remember Yelena , just because someone 's mind is receptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive into their deeper thoughts . That 's a breach of our Ethical Code . " Her words were harsh , the master level magician scolding her student . " Sorry , " I said . She shook her head . " I forget that you 're still learning . We need to get to the Citadel and begin your training , but I 'm afraid this stop will take some time . " " Why ? " " I ca n't leave you with your family like I did for the other children , and it would be cruel to take you away too soon . " Just then , a loud voice from above called out , " Venettaden . " Irys swung her arm up and mumbled something , but my muscles froze before I could repel the magic that engulfed us . I could n't move . After a frantic moment of panic , I calmed my mind . I tried to build a mental wall of defense , but the magic that ensnared me knocked down my mental bricks as fast as I could stack them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the treetops . " We 're friends of the Zaltanas . I 'm Irys of the Jewelrose Clan , Fourth Magician in the Council . " Another strange word echoed from the trees . My legs trembled as the magic released me and I sank to the ground to wait for the faintness to pass . The twins , Gracena and Nickeely collapsed together , moaning . May rubbed her legs . " Why have you come , Irys Jewelrose ? " the voice above asked . " I believe I may have found your lost daughter , " she replied . A rope ladder descended through the branches . " Let 's go , girls , " Irys said . " Here , Yelena , hold the bottom while we climb . " A peevish thought about who would hold the ladder for me flashed through my mind . Irys 's annoyed voice admonished me in my own head . Yelena , you will have no trouble getting into the trees . Perhaps I should have them raise the ladder when it 's your turn to climb , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was right , of course . I had used the trees to hide from my enemies in Ixia without the convenience of a ladder . And even now , I 'd enjoyed an occasional " walk " through the treetops to keep my skills honed . Irys smiled at me . Perhaps it 's in your blood . My stomach filled with unease as I remembered Mogkan . He had said I was cursed with Zaltana blood . I 'd no reason to trust the now dead southern magician , though , and I 'd been avoiding asking Irys questions about the Zaltanas so I would n't get my hopes up about being a part of their family . Even while dying , I knew Mogkan would have been capable of pulling one last spiteful trick . Mogkan and General Brazell 's son , Reyad , had kidnapped me along with over thirty other children from Sitia . Averaging two children a year , they had brought the girls and boys north to Brazell 's " orphanage " in the Territory of Ixia for use in their twisted plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they had been born to families with strong magic . Irys had explained to me that magical powers were a gift , and only a handful of magicians came from each clan . " Of course , the more magicians in a family , " Irys had said , " the greater chance of having more in the next generation . Mogkan took a risk kidnapping children so young ; magical powers do n't manifest until a child reaches maturity . " " Why were there more girls than boys ? " I had asked . " Only thirty percent of our magicians are males , and Bain Bloodgood is the only one to achieve master level status . " As I steadied the rope ladder that hung from the jungle 's canopy , I now wondered how many Zaltanas were magicians . Beside me , the three girls tucked the hems of their dresses into their belts . Irys helped May start up the rope rungs , and then Gracena and Nickeely followed . When we had crossed the border into Sitia , the girls had n't hesitated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses worn by some of the southern women . The boys switched their uniforms for simple cotton pants and tunics . I , on the other hand , had kept my food taster 's uniform on until the heat and humidity had driven me to purchase a pair of boy 's cotton pants and a shirt . After Irys disappeared into the green canopy , I set my boot on the bottom rung . My feet felt as if they were swollen with water , weighing me down . Reluctance clung to my legs as I dragged them up the ladder . In midair , I paused . What if these people did n't want me ? What if they did n't believe I was their lost daughter ? What if I were too old to be bothered with ? All the children who had already found their homes had been immediately accepted . Between the ages of seven and thirteen , they had been separated from their families for only a few years . Physical resemblances , ages , and even names had made it easy to place them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins , Gracena and Nickeely were thirteen . May was the youngest at twelve , and I was the oldest of the group at twenty . According to Irys , the Zaltanas had lost a six-year-old girl over fourteen years prior . That was a long time to be away . I was no longer a child . Yet I was the oldest one who had survived Brazell 's plans and remained whole . When the other kidnapped children reach maturity , those who had developed magical powers had been tortured until they surrendered their souls to Mogkan and Reyad . Mogkan had then used the magic of these now mindless captives to enhance his own , making the children nothing more than living bodies without souls . Irys bore the burden of informing the families of these children , but I felt some guilt by being the only one to survive Mogkan 's efforts to capture my soul . The effort , though , cost me a great deal . Thinking about my struggles in Ixia led to thoughts of Valek . An ache for him chewed at my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butterfly pendant he had carved for me . Perhaps I could devise a way to return to Ixia . After all , the magic in my body no longer flared out of control , and I would much rather be with him than among these strange southerners who lived in the trees . Even the name of the south , Sitia , felt thick as rancid syrup in my mouth . " Yelena , come on , " Irys called down to me . " We 're waiting . " I swallowed hard and ran a hand over my long braid , smoothing my black hair and pulling out the few viney tendrils that clung to it . Despite the long trek through the jungle , I was n't too tired . While shorter than most Ixians at five feet four inches , my body had transformed from emaciated to muscular during my last year in Ixia . The difference had been in my living arrangements . From starving in the dungeon to tasting food for Commander Ambrose , my situation had improved for my physical well-being , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . I shook my head , banishing those thoughts and concentrating on my immediate circumstances . Climbing up the rest of the ladder , I expected it to end at a wide branch or a platform in the tree like a landing on a staircase . Instead , I entered a room . I looked around in amazement . The walls and ceiling of the room were formed by branches and limbs that had been roped together . Sunlight leaked in between the gaps . Bundled sticks had been worked into chairs that had cushions made of leaves . The small room held only four seats . " Is this her ? " a tall man asked Irys . His cotton tunic and short pants were the color of the tree 's leaves . Green gel had been combed into his hair and smeared over all his exposed skin . A bow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder . I guessed he was the guard . Why , though , would he need a weapon if he were the magician who had frozen us ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could she turn aside an arrow as well ? " Yes , " Irys said to the man . " We 've heard rumors at the market , and wondered if you would pay us a visit , Fourth Magician . Please , stay here , " he said . " I 'll get the Elder . " Irys sank into one of the chairs , and the girls explored the room , exclaiming over the view from the single window . I paced the narrow space . The guard seemed to disappear through the wall , but upon investigation , I discovered a gap that led to a bridge also made of branches . " Sit down , " Irys said to me . " Relax . You 're safe here . " " Even with that heartwarming reception ? " I countered . " Standard procedure . Unaccompanied visitors are extremely rare . With the constant danger of jungle predators , most travelers hire a Zaltana guide . You 've been edgy and defensive ever since I told you we were headed to the Zaltana 's village . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fighting stance , prepared for attack . These people are your family . Why would they want to hurt you ? " I realized that I had pulled my weapon off my back , and was clutching it in the ready position . With effort , I relaxed my posture . " Sorry . " I threaded the bow , a five-foot wooden staff , back into its holder on the side of my backpack . Fear of the unknown had caused me to clench . For as long as I could remember in Ixia , I had been told my family was dead . Lost to me forever . Even so , I used to dream of finding an adopted family who would love and care for me . I had only given up that fantasy when I had been turned into Mogkan and Reyad 's experiment , and now that I had Valek , I felt I did n't need a family . " That 's not true , Yelena , " Irys said aloud . " Your family will help you discover who you are and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought you said it was against your Ethical Code to read someone 's mind . " I rankled at her intrusion on my private thoughts . " We are linked as teacher and student . You freely gave me a pathway to your mind by accepting me as your mentor . It would be easier to divert a waterfall than to break our link . " " I do n't remember creating a pathway , " I grumbled . " If there was a conscious effort in making a link , it would n't have happened . " She watched my face for a while . " You gave me your trust and your loyalty . That was all that was needed to forge a bond . While I wo n't pry into your intimate thoughts and memories , I can pick up on your surface emotions . " I opened my mouth to reply , but the green-haired guard returned . " Follow me , " he said . We wound our way through the treetops . Hallways and bridges connected room after room high above the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellings from the ground . We did n't see or meet a soul as we passed around bedrooms and through living areas . From glimpses into the rooms , I saw they were decorated with items found in the jungle . Coconut shells , nuts , berries , grasses , twigs and leaves were all artfully arranged into wall hangings , book covers , boxes and statues . Someone had even fashioned an exact replica of one of those long-tailed animals by using white and black stones glued together . " Irys , " I said , pointing to the statue , " what are those animals ? " " Valmurs . Very intelligent and playful . There are millions of them in the jungle . They 're curious , too . Remember how they spied on us from the trees ? " I nodded , recalling the little creatures that never stood still long enough for me to study . In other rooms , I spotted more animal replicas made from different colored stones . A hollowness touched my throat as I thought of Valek and the animals he carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsman-ship of these stone statues . Perhaps I could send one to him . I did n't know when I 'd ever be able to see him again . The Commander had exiled me to Sitia when he had discovered I possessed magical powers . If I returned to Ixia , the Commander 's order of execution would be in effect , but he had never said I could n't communicate with my friends in Ixia . I soon found out why we had n't encountered anyone on our journey through the village . We entered a large , round common room where about two hundred people gathered . It appeared the entire settlement was here . People filled the benches of carved wood that circled a huge fire pit made of stone . Talk ceased the minute we entered . All eyes focused on me . My skin crawled . I felt as if they were examining every inch of my face , my clothes and my muddy boots . From their expressions , I gathered I was n't meeting expectations . I stifled the desire to hide behind Irys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Zaltanas thumped in my chest . At last , an older man stepped forward . " I 'm Bavol Cacao Zaltana , Elder Councilman for the Zaltana family . Are you Yelena Liana Zaltana ? " I hesitated . That name sounded so formal , so connected , so foreign . " My name is Yelena , " I said . A young man a few years older than I pushed through the crowd . He stopped next to the Elder . Squinting hard , his jade-eyed gaze bore into mine . A mixture of hatred and revulsion creased his face . I felt a slight touch of magic brush my body . " She has killed , " he called out . " She reeks of blood . " Continues ...
