Im finishing reading all the days new job postings when Fletch walks in . " Hey , sweetie , whats up ? Youre home really early . " Maisy and Loki bark and spin , delighted at their dads unexpected arrival . I am too because Im dying for a little human interaction . I talk to those damn dogs all day long . Someday theyre going to start talking back , and I am simply not prepared for that . Then I notice that Fletch is carrying a huge paper box full of personal effects . Uh-oh . " You want the good news or the bad news first ? " I take a deep breath . " Bad , please . " " I was laid off . " I gesture towards his box . " I figured . But you know what ? Its not your fault . I know how hard you worked and Im very proud of the job you did there . Are you OK ? " I fight my way through the dogs to give Fletch a big hug . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , we suspected this might happen . " Actually , I am . They gave me a decent severance package and Ill still get my year-end bonus . Plus Im eligible for Unemployment insurance , so well be OK for a little while . " " Thats the good news ? " " Nope . When Clark told me my position was eliminated , he could barely keep from smiling . Miserable son of a bitch . While Im packing up my stuff and commiserating with everyone else Lisa , Bill , and Ernesto are also gone the Regional VP goes into Clarks office and closes the door . Two minutes later we hear shouting and slamming . Apparently Clark got canned too . " " He did nt know it was coming ? " " Completely blind-sided him . " " Thats hilarious . " " Yeah , but I did nt tell you the best part . Right before I walked out , I poked my head in his door and said , Ill save you a place in line at the Unemployment Office . Must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took a swing at me ! " " No way ! " " I kid you not . Ernesto called the police and the whole team got to enjoy watching Clark being escorted out in handcuffs . Best day of work ever . " A malevolent grin plays across his face . " You baited him . " Im always secretly delighted when Fletch gets in touch with his inner evil-streak . " You bet I did . That man made me miserable for three years with his explosive rage . He was so much like my dad . As I never had the pleasure of seeing my father arrested , this was the next best thing . I should be upset about losing my job , but I feel great . " The phone rings and I peer at the Caller ID . " Fletch , hold that thought its Midwest IR . Im crossing my fingers that its an offer . " I take a deep breath before grabbing the phone . " Good afternoon , Jennifer speaking . " " Hi , Jennifer . Its Julie from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks ! Whats up ? " Im trying to sound cool , but really Im a basket case . I need this job now more than ever . After an entire YEAR off , Im dying to get back to work . Im even thrilled at the prospect of wearing pantyhose again . Shoot , Ill take public transportation if I need to . This way Fletch can be on my health insurance so he does nt have to worry about COBRA . Ooh , and Ill start another 401 K and can begin to feel like a real adult again.1 So what if its a step down ? With my work ethic Ill be back on top in no time . I predict a promotion in six months or less . After all , the other VPs loved me at Midwest IR . And when- " Im calling to say weve decided to go in a different direction . " " Im sorry , can you repeat that ? " The dogs are still yipping and whining , so I must have heard her wrong . " Weve decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interview after hearing so many good things about you . " " I do nt understand . I promise I wouldnt be bored if thats your concern . I know I worked on more advanced projects before , but - " " You just do nt have the kind of experience we need in this department . " " Cut the crap , Julie . I created the very product your department supports , so do nt tell me Im not experienced . Level with me . When Corp . Com . laid me off they never gave me a reason and its driven me nuts for a whole year . Be honest . Was I overly confident ? Arrogant ? Whatever was wrong , please tell me so I can fix it before I interview anywhere else . " Julie sighs and lowers her voice . " Jen , you did everything right and I really lobbied for your hire . But Ben wont let me bring you back . He says youre too unprofessional . " Oh , that is rich . " Julie , do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not solely because I got a better offer . Ben threw a cup of coffee at me during a board meeting while screaming , If you cant give me the fucking answers I want , then fucking lie to me ! But as I was not about to let that old bastard see me cry , I replied , Come on , sir , youre the president of this place get it together . I should have thrown coffee back at him . Instead , I went home to change clothes and post my resume . " " I heard a rumor about that . " Bens unprofessional behavior is legendary . " I swear I did nt know it was you . Things must really be tough out there if you were willing to come back here . " " You do nt know the half of it . " " God , Im so sorry . Take care , and if you need a reference ? Call me . " Before I even hang up the phone , Fletch is by my side . " No luck ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute ago I was elated because I thought that job was mine . Now Im scared to death because no one in this household has an income . How are we going to pay for this place ? How are we going to keep up with our bills ? How am I ever going to get my hair colored again ? " I begin to pace and wring my hands . " You know what we should do right now ? " Fletch asks . " Pray ? Cry ? Move back to Indiana so I can work at Hardees , as my brother keeps helpfully suggesting ? " " No . Were going to the Four Seasons . " " Are you insane ? " " I say we celebrate the end of the Dot Com era by going out with a bang . Our days of posing at their bar are over , so why not celebrate with a couple of $15 Martinis ? " " You are insane . " Brief silence . " And Ill be ready in ten minutes . " * * * Four Seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pooor but haaaaappppeee ! ! Fletchhhss is SCHMARTEST MOST HANDDSUM MAN ALIVE even wiscch his pancake butt . Mmmm pancakes ! Sommebuddy buuuy me pancakes ? Pleeeeease ? Drunkety . Most , most exccccelent drunkety.2 * * * " Jen , its a simple favor , " Fletch says . " But I do nt want to , " I reply . " Come on , itll be easy . And youll get to drive the Cadillac . " " I can drive the Caddy any time I want . " " But you never have anywhere to go . " " So ? I can still use it to take the dogs to the park . " " Last time you drove them it took a week to scrub all the mud off the seats . Admit it . Theres no good reason not to do this for Carol . " " Then you do it . " " Number one , she did nt ask me , number two , I have an interview that afternoon , and number three , shes the only non-relative you have whos been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God , I hate when he s right . A couple of days ago Carol emailed to ask a favor . Her familys coming up from Indianapolis this weekend . Carol and her small children are visiting friends and her husband Pete is running the Chicago marathon . As their time here is limited , Carol asked if I could go to the convention center and pick up Petes official race pack . Since Ive got NOTHING going on right now , theres no good reason I cant do this simple task for my oldest friend ... except that I do nt want to because , according to Fletch I can be a trifle torpid and a bit selfish.3 " Jen , think about it . How often does Carol ask you to do anything for her ? " " Almost never , " I concede . " And how many times has she done something unpleasant for you ? " " Well ... there was that time in high school when I insisted we see Desperately Seeking Susan in full on Wannabe-like-Madonna gear . " Poor Carol . Warily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heavy Kohl eyeliner and her Topsiders for torn fishnets . And when I yanked her out of her seat to dance in the aisle with me to Get Into the Groove , she never once complained , even when I accidentally stabbed her with an over-sized cross.4 " Is that it ? " " No . She also used to let me ride to our Speech meets in the back of her car and do Queen Elizabeth waves . " " And ? " " Once when I was a sophomore she came up from I.U. and we met these Alpha Sigs at a party . I got to make out with the cute one with the Flock of Seagulls haircut while she patiently listened to his roommate prattle on in painstaking detail about the musical genius of Jethro Tull. " 5 " Uh huh . Anything else ? " " Um she never judged me in my junior year when I thought it would be fun to live my life like a character in a Bret Easton Ellis novel . " 6 " Are you forgetting her wedding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one time I should have shaken myself out of my perpetual , narcissistic haze and paid her special attention Carol had to come to my hotel room to hustle me down to the ceremony . Id lost track of time while grooming myself and almost delayed the start of the wedding . Looking back at our lives together , I realize in the Big Book of Favors , Im woefully lacking credit . Ive always taken more than Ive given . Im not sure I deserve a friend like Carol . Defeated , I admit , " OK , OK . Youve got me . Ill do it . " 1 Thank God . 2 Six hours and $250 later . 3 He is SO sleeping on the couch tonight . 4 It was a very brief phase . I was back to Tartan plaid within the week . 5 The roommates nickname was " Zitty-Zitty Bang-Bang . " 6 A very bad phase . Do nt ask .
