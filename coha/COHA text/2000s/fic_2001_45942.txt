Me and my neighbor Frank Main used to get along real good till the dog thing . We got two kids each , only a year apart in school , and his wife and my wife take turns sometimes driving carpool . I took his mail in every day for two weeks while they had their vacation , and once when I dropped an intake manifold on my foot , Frank mowed my lawn for five weeks running . I think he 's one of those America-America guys , like , you 're here now , so speak English , but in nine years he never made fun of my English-even at the beginning when it was n't so good-or mentioned nothing about it . Like so long as I was trying , you know ? I got mixed feelings about that but it never much got in our way . <p> Anyhow , a while back his boy , Eddie , got after him to get a dog . And I even put in my two cents . I said you 'll never regret it , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look what Blackie is to our family . The kids love her , she takes care of the house , she even gets me off my lazy behind to walk her every morning and every night and that 's good for the both of us . <p> She 's the best dog , Blackie , big as a house , nearly eighty pounds , I think , though I never picked her up and put her on a scale , but so gentle . Shepherd and some Labrador and maybe something else , too . She can see her favorite food in my son 's hand , a big juicy piece of steak , maybe , and she 'll take it so gentle he 'll giggle because he says it tickles his hand . And to think a dog like that was on her last day at the pound . Just think , Frank , I said , you could save a life like that , too , and that dog 'll pay you back in more ways than you even knew there were . <p> So I felt real good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the perfect dog . <p> Great , I said , when are you bringing him home ? I ca n't wait to see . Is it a male dog or female ? <p> Not sure , he said . Have n't decided yet . The bitch is expected to whelp in three weeks , then the breeder likes to let ' em nurse seven or eight weeks before he weans ' em-that makes ' em nice and confident since they 're born guard dogs-and then me and Eddie get our pick of the litter and we 'll be bringing it on home . <p> Now wait , I said , now hold on a minute here , let me get something straight . You found the perfect dog but it is n't even born yet ? He just smiled in a way that made me see the first of the trouble coming on . Then how do you know it 's perfect ? You got a crystal ball to look in ? <p> Researched it , he said . Bloodlines . Pedigree papers . Red Doberman pinscher , championship lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I could already feel things get hot behind my ears . This is never a good sign . <p> Blackie is a hell of a watchdog , I said . And she was nearly free , out of the county pound . One time Blackie just out of nowhere howled like a banshee and lit out across the yard and leaped up at a spot on the corner of the fence . Slammed right into the fence and brought us running . We had no idea why but in a few minutes later some creep was caught looking over the back fence at widow Jesperson 's place down the street . <p> Like I said , Blackie is big as a house , and if she were to say to you , Stay out of my family 's yard , I just bet you would . I just damn well bet you would . <p> I did n't think I should ask how much this pure red Doberman was costing him , but I wanted to know real bad . <p> Anyhow , I could see things going in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breaths and I said to myself , It 's a free country , man can get any dog he wants . Man can do what he wants , even if it 's stupid . So all I said was , Ca n't wait to see , Frank , and then I went inside to take it out on my poor wife . <p> If I made the America laws , I said to my poor wife , who was trying to finish the lunch dishes , a guy could still do what Frank is doing , only first he 'd have to go to the pound and walk up and down all those rows and look in the eyes of all those smart , pretty dogs , and tell them why they 're just not good enough . Why they got ta die while he 's waiting for something better to get born . And another thing , I said . What kind of example is that to set for your kids ? Here 's how much we respect life , kids . Let 's make sure lots of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that are already here . Cause , you know , our dog has to be special . And another thing . I wonder what he 's paying for that dog . What do you think , Sofi ? Guess . <p> I could n't guess , Cacho , she said . I got no idea . Probably a lot . <p> Just my point . Just what I 'm saying . Probably a lot . <p> Then she dried her hands and touched my shoulder like she does when she wants me to breathe deep and think on happier things . And I swear I thought no more about it till that dog come home . <p> Now there are crimes against nature and there are crimes against nature , but please tell me why , if the good Lord put a certain set of parts on a dog , why would a guy go and cut some of them off again ? Would you tell me that , please ? Does Frank Main know more about dogs than God does ? Is that it ? I 'm not trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I seen lots of dogs with tails cut off but it 's still a crime against nature if you ask me . But then Frank tells me he 's going to have the vet cut off half of those pretty silky ears and tape what 's left to splints so they 'll stick up straight . <p> While he 's telling me this the pup is sitting on one hip , all off at an angle , and she turns her head to follow some movement , a bird or a fly , I do n't know , and almost falls right over . For all that money I do n't think she 's very smart . But that does n't make it right what he 's saying . She 's flesh and blood , after all . <p> Why ? I ask him . That 's all I want to know . Why take a knife to a healthy pup ? <p> She 's purebred Dobie , he says . Got to at least look like one . <p> Then he goes inside before we can really talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls her-starts chewing on one of his wife 's marigolds in the nice planted beds . I stand and watch over the fence , and she gets tired of the flower after a time and digs up the whole plant . Frank 's wife , Sharon , loves those flowers . Does n't he know you ca n't just leave a new pup alone like that ? They need tending . Figures Frank does n't know nothing about dogs or he would n't be cutting parts off them . Anyhow , puppies are always trouble . Got ta watch them every minute . Blackie was fourteen months when we got her . It 's better that way , because all those bad stages are over and besides , people do n't like to take the grown ones . They die a lot more regular in the pound . It 's stupid , too , because they 're better dogs and they get to love you just fine and if you ca n't train them it just means you do n't know nothing about dogs . They 're better dogs but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up at me with eyes that do n't look so smart for all that money . Blackie never digs up the yard . Blackie is a great dog . Over the next month or two I get real good at how not to look over the fence . She may be raising hell over there , chewing up landscape and digging for China , but I 'll say one thing for that dog , she never makes a sound . Never hear a bark out of her . Sometimes I used to hear Eddie come out and play with her , yell at her to fetch and stuff but it seems like he never does no more . Like he 's back playing with his friends and forgot all about her . The girl is a year younger . She used to go out on the weekend but I guess that dog is too rough for her , because she always ran inside crying . This is all I can hear and I 've taught myself not to look over the fence . <p> I think it 's funny how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking Blackie , Monday , a couple hours before work , and here comes Frank and Gretta . She looks nearly half  --  grown now , big enough to pull him down the street . Her ears are taped and she 's just crazy . I mean this is one hyper dog . Since this is the first I bumped into them outside the yard , I guess I see why . I 'm not saying they never went out before , just I never bumped into them and I 'm out two times a day like clockwork . So we walk together for about three blocks , and the pup is scrambling , churning her legs three times for every one of Blackie 's steps , like running in place , like overdrive . She 's jumping up at Blackie , slamming at her side , and Blackie does n't hardly notice . Frank is telling me how he hired some pro painter guys to come over and paint his house . I 'm looking at the tape all around this poor dog 's butchered ears and listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You should 've told me , I say . I 'd 've pitched in . Two weekends we 'd get it done . <p> No , that 's okay , Frank says . Get the pros , they do a good job . <p> So for a minute I 'm thinking , What , I would n't do a good job ? And I almost say it . But then Frank turns for home . They been out all of six minutes . <p> What , that 's it ? I say . Poor dog needs more exercise than that . <p> I got ta go , he says . Got ta get to the office . <p> He never said the office before . He always called it work . Just work . He works in a big office on the sixteenth floor downtown and I work in a city garage , maintaining service vehicles . I call it work and he calls it work , but all of a sudden it 's the office . Then I think maybe I 'm reading too much in . <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me are going all the way down to Figueroa . I 'll put her in your yard after . <p> Sure , I guess , he says . Thanks . Yeah , good . Thanks . <p> He turns back and I take hold of this little hellion by her stitched leather leash , and man , can that little girl pull . After a while I get tired of hearing her choke herself , so I break from a walk to a jog . It 's been a while since I jogged . Months , and even then it was n't regular . So it hurts my chest but feels kind of good , too , and I go through that wall like I always used to . You know , where you think you ca n't go more but you do , and then you settle in and get past it and kind of chug along . Blackie loves it . She 's loping like a rocking horse , throwing herself up in the air instead of stretching out , so she wo n't get ahead of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide . Every day . A young woman comes out on her stoop to get her morning paper , and while she bends over she sees Gretta and her ear tape and gives me a bad look . One of those " How could you ? " looks . Not my dog , I say . <p> Either she does n't believe me or she 's mad at me anyhow . <p> When we get back , Frank is just heading out to his car for work . Oh , excuse me , the office . <p> You know , it 's not just me , I say , and he looks at me funny . I say , Wherever I went with this dog , people think it 's not right to put her through that . <p> Through what ? Frank says . <p> The cropping . <p> That 's what Frank calls it . Cropping . I call it taking a scalpel and slicing up one of God 's perfect creatures , but I 'm trying to have a civil conversation with the guy . <p> Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes ' em good dogs . Makes em more stoic , you know ? <p> Actually , I 'm not sure I do . I heard the word stoic before , and maybe I knew what it meant at the time , but I ca n't make it come back to me now . <p> Frank keeps talking . They get used to pain , and they 're better dogs for it . <p> Stoic . Right . I got it now . All of a sudden I 'm mad . Real mad . Last time I got this mad I was still living with my father in Argentina . Now that my father is far away I do n't get so mad anymore . Till now . I say something really loud . I say , What ? Really loud I yell it and Gretta pees , right there , without even squatting down . It just leaks right out of her . I 'm right up in Frank 's face and I do n't even remember how I got there . My brain knows I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . <p> Want me to make you stoic , Frank ? I ask him that . I say , You 'll be a better man for it . <p> I just want him to think what he 's saying , that 's all . How it sounds , what he 's saying . <p> You do it , he says , and I 'll have the cops on you so fast . <p> Then he goes to his car . Leaves me to put his prize dog away in the yard . <p> We do n't talk again for three months . Every morning and every night I take Gretta out of his yard and she jogs with us , but we never talk , me and Frank . <p> You never know who somebody is . You think you know but you do n't . <p> Then after three months I come home from our run and I have to talk to Frank , to tell him Gretta 's spotting . Tell him I ca n't take her for runs till she 's done being in heat because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big males to keep them away . We barely made it home . Poor Gretta . She 's got ta feel bad when she loses those runs . It 's pretty much all she 's got . <p> So I knock on his door . <p> I tell him all the stuff the vet told us about Blackie . Tell him it can happen to anybody , that our Blackie got in one surprise heat , too , before we got her spayed . That she has to be locked in the house or she 'll get pregnant , and now the vet wo n't spay her till the heat is over . <p> From the look on Frank 's face you 'd think I just explained the whole thing to him in Spanish . <p> Spay ? he says . <p> Yeah . Spay . Fix . Neuter . <p> Spay ? he says again . He just ca n't seem to wrap his head around that word . You think I 'm going to get a two-thousand-dollar dog spayed ? <p> Two thousand dollars . Two thousand dollars is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing high . And I decide I 'm not going to say all the stuff I want to say to him because he will never see a thing my way . We 'll just keep banging heads . I 'll say there 's too many puppies in the world and he 'll say people want champion Dobies , so these 'll get homes . And I 'll say that do n't matter , it 's still homes snatched right out from under those that 're already here , and he 'll say the people who buy his puppies were never headed for the pound no matter what . And then he 'll slam the door in my face . Or worse yet , I 'll really hit him this time , and the cops will come , and I 'll be the wrong one , and all the shame will be mine . <p> Better keep her locked up in the house , then , I say . <p> Sharon does n't like her in the house . Dog wo n't housebreak . <p> All dogs housebreak . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any dog 'll housebreak . Just lots of people do n't know how to go about it . <p> Might have to build her a five-sided run , then , I say . <p> I see in Frank 's face that he does n't want my advice , any of it , never did . Two thousand dollars . I bought my last car for less than that and it 's a good car . Sofi drives it now and it still runs good . <p> The yard is nice and secure , he says . <p> I start up to tell him that he does n't know what a female in heat will do to get out , what the males will do to get at her . But Frank closes the door . Does n't slam it , but closes it , and me and Blackie and Gretta are on the street on our own . Does n't even take his damn two-thousand-dollar dog back . I have to put her away in the yard . <p> While I do I look at Frank 's house , all nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little nicer than mine . I never noticed that before it was painted . I knew it was bigger but I did n't think about it as nicer . And even in the month or so since the pro paint job , it 's sort of been there to see without me seeing it . <p> Like a lot of other things I guess . <p> The next thing that happens is so not avoidable I almost do n't have to tell it . It practically tells itself . I 'm in the back room that Saturday with the windows open for air , and I hear some commotion , some scuffling and whimpering , so I go out , and I look over the fence . A dog is digging through from the other side . I can see his nose now and then , and his paws flying , and Gretta right at the fence cheering him on . Digging from her side , too . Then he tries to squeeze through , does n't make it on the first try , has to back out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I run get my Polaroid . <p> When you work on cars , a Polaroid is a good thing to have . Take pictures of all the smog fittings and stuff or you wo n't never get them back where they go . Take pictures of parts and then post them for sale . Take pictures of ugly mongrel dogs in your neighbor 's yard with his prize bitch . <p> I get back out and the dog is through the fence and Gretta and him are going at it and let me tell you , he 's even uglier than I thought . He 's got some wire-haired something in him , but a big head like a bassett mixed with an Airedale and a million other things . I 'm a big lover of dogs and no stickler for beautiful but this is an eyesore of a dog if there ever was one . You almost got to love him for looking so bad . <p> They 're holding still now and they 're in that part I think where they 're tied and they could n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'll turn a hose on two dogs and think they 're just too into it to stop , but that male is tied in there till it goes down and he 's not going nowhere till it 's over . I snap off a couple of shots . <p> I take them inside and watch them turn into pictures , and they come out pretty good . First I think I just wo n't tell him . After all , I warned him once already . If I told him , he could go to the vet and get it aborted early . If I do n't we all get to see what those damn puppies look like . That brings a smile on my face , I got to admit . But then I think it would n't be Frank to get hurt , it would be the puppies . One thing I know for damn sure , two people get into it over a dog , the loser will be the dog . <p> But I do n't want any fistfights , so I tell Sharon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out tending the garden . Trying to put it back to where it was before Gretta , I should say . Sharon is crouching down , sweaty , and Gretta is on a chain . <p> Good morning , I say . <p> She jumps . Oh . Hi . Yeah . <p> Why is Gretta chained ? I did n't mean to ask . This will get us off on a bad foot . <p> Oh . Frank said she tried to dig out under the fence . <p> She did n't , though . I tell Sharon that . I say , A male dug in and got her pregnant . I just wanted you guys to know that . So you can figure what you want to do . <p> See ? After all that 's happened I 'm still trying to be a good neighbor to this man . That 's who I am . Whatever Frank is , that 's what I am . The dirt has been half-assed filled in where it was dug . <p> Sharon wipes her face off on the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , she says . <p> I stand there and say nothing . She does n't believe me . I ca n't believe this . She thinks I 'm lying ? All I have to do is go inside and get those pictures . Polaroids never lie . But I do n't . Because , you know why ? Because I 'm doing too much already , to be a good neighbor . And Frank , he 's doing not enough . So , Frank , you got some really ugly mutt puppies in your future and it 's nobody 's fault but your own . <p> When Gretta starts to show , Frank calls me at my house . Talks to Sofi . Sofi covers the phone and says Frank wants to know if I actually saw a dog in his yard . If I know anything about who his dog might 've bred with . <p> Tell him to go to hell , I say . <p> She does n't . She tells him I do n't remember . Now I make it sound like we are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of course not . There 's lots of others , they just do n't figure in about the dog . Till after she gets pregnant . Then Frank is all over asking people if they saw whose dog it was . Acting as if I saw but wo n't talk . Acting as if he could 've got to the situation in time if I 'd talked . How 'd it take him so long to figure out the dog was pregnant anyways ? I mean , does n't he ever go out there and look at her ? <p> Anyhow , my neighbors on the other side are the Li family . I do n't talk much with them , mainly because they wo n't talk to me or much of anybody else . Sometimes I try to talk to them about neighborhood things , good things that will help , but they do n't want trouble . They do n't say it like that but I can see . They say things like Thank you and Yes , yes , over and over and hurry back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I known him since he was in high school , since they first come here from China , and now he 's in graduate school but home for the summer . He wants trouble , if it 's the right kind . If it 's his kind of trouble . <p> Richie knocks on our door one night after dinner . <p> I send the kids upstairs to do homework and I sit with Richie in the family room and Sofi worries around getting us brandy while he tells me Frank came to see him . <p> Richie says , Like it 's my problem his stupid dog got knocked up . Know how much he paid for that dog ? Four thousand dollars . <p> I heard two . <p> You heard wrong . <p> Frank told me . Two . <p> Then that 's all he wants you to know . <p> But also , I think , sometimes things go too many places around a neighborhood , and while they 're traveling they get too big . <p> Richie looks so grown up now . His hair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up handsome . He 's going to be a businessman . A good one . <p> I did n't know you do n't like Frank , I say , because it 's coming out while he talks . <p> Of course I do n't like him , he 's a bigot . You do n't like him , do you ? <p> Well , I guess I used to , I say . I do n't think he 's a bigot exactly . Just stupid . Especially about dogs . And maybe a little ... like he 's better than I am . <p> Richie sits back with his brandy and we both know I just said it . Frank is a bigot . I always knew it , but till I said it out loud to Richie Li , I did n't know . Explain a thing like that . <p> The purebred dog thing is a riot , Richie says . That dog is so stupid . And a total failure as a watchdog . I hope the ugliest mutt in the world knocked her up . <p> Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hard not to . <p> Wait , I said . Wait till you see . <p> And I went and got the pictures of the dogs going at it . I guess that 's why I took them . Cause that dog was ugly in a way I could never describe . Richie just howled with laughing . I never heard nobody laugh so hard for such a time . And I looked again and it was even funnier with Richie here , because we neither one of us like Frank . <p> Oh , please can I have one of these ? he said . <p> Do n't show Frank , though . <p> Why not ? <p> And miss the look on his face when he sees those puppies ? <p> But I did give Richie one , and he took it to his father 's copy place and made color photocopies , and gave them to all the neighbors that did n't like Frank . You know , people like us and not like Frank . I guess I always knew the block was divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it deep till this dog thing . <p> Then every time Frank took this big pregnant dog for a walk , which was n't very much , the neighbors who were like us got a good laugh behind their hand . I guess it was mean but I did n't do it , anyhow . Richie Li did it . And also Frank deserves it because he 's stupid , especially about dogs , and besides he 's a bigot . <p> Now it seems to me that anytime you do something you probably should n't do , you can bet it , will come around to bite you . <p> So a couple evenings before Gretta is due to whelp I get a big knock at my door . The whole family jumps , because it 's one of those police knocks . Either that or fire people to say get out right away . One of those shocking trouble knocks . <p> I answer the door and there stands Frank . He has a paper in his hand , and he holds it up about an inch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies Richie Li made from the dog picture . I step out onto the dark front yard and close the door behind me to spare the family from trouble . While I do I 'm feeling that cold flutter when you know things are coming to battle . I notice a couple of the neighbors out already . That police knock sure gets attention . <p> Frank is yelling at me . Yelling that he 's trying to sue the people whose dog got into his yard , and here I have evidence and I do n't give it to him , I give it to other people in the neighborhood so they can laugh at him . Loud enough so more neighbors come . And it seems funny how they come . Maybe it 's just chance but the people behind Frank are people more like Frank . The people behind me I can only guess , because it 's getting to be that dogfighting thing where you do n't look away . <p> None of this seems very much real . <p> He holds the picture in my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> God help me , I crack a smile , I ca n't stop . <p> It 's a little funny , I say . Yes . <p> Then just as I expect the fight to start for real I hear the voice of Richie Li behind me . Richie says , I think it 's fucking hilarious . <p> That slows things down because Frank ca n't swing on two men at once . <p> Richie says , Frank , you know what ? No wonder you got no sense of humor about that picture . Because you 're a mongrel yourself and you know it . <p> Frank 's face twists around and I notice that I can see the veins under his forehead . Even just with the streetlight I can see . His face is red and there are veins in his temples and it 's because his skin is so white . <p> Excuse me ? he says to Richie . <p> Just what I said , Frank . My family has been nothing but Chinese for eons . My friend here is from pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian and you 're just a big mix of all those people who came later on a boat . <p> There are more people behind me than I thought and I know they are people like me because I can hear them saying yeah . Richie says , Is n't that right , Cacho ? and slaps a hand down on my shoulder . <p> Yes , I say . That 's right . <p> It is right , but it 's wrong , too , because if somebody looked at Blackie and said mutt like a bad thing I 'd kick his ass . But I 'm with Richie . But I feel a little bit like I know what it means to be a gun . Like there 's a bigger fight and it 's not so much about me but I 'm the trigger gets pulled . <p> Frank throws the picture at my face . It 's on a heavy stock like thin cardboard and the corner hits my eye . It 's a shock to all of a sudden hurt so this must be the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn with our fists ready , not up exactly but balled up and ready . I do n't dare look away but I see Sofi standing on our stoop . See her at the corner of my eye , as she was when I raised fists to my father . Back then I looked over to see her face , asking me to please not . Then I looked back at the face of my father and saw all cold . When I did it , he would n't hit me back or call the police , only close his heart to me . Which in most ways he already had . Maybe that 's why I was mad enough to hit . Maybe that 's why I 'm here again now . I did n't give Sofi her wish that day . Instead we gather up and run to this country . But I 'm running low on countries where I think I can live . <p> My fists go straight , turn back to hands . I turn my head to look at my wife . To let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As I do , Frank 's fist slams my cheekbone . A good solid punch , enough to knock me back , slap on my brain . But it does n't knock me down . I was in fighting stand , one leg well back , feet out . I just snap back and then straight again . I hear a little Oooh from the crowd because he really did it , then a sprinkle of cheer from the people more like me because I 'm still on my feet . It does make me seem sort of unbeatable . <p> I turn my back on Frank and go inside with my wife . I will not hit him back . Just go inside with my wife and put ice on my face . He will be the one that hit . He will always have to live with being the one that hit . <p> It 's hard being the one that hit . I almost feel sorry for Frank . <p> Three days later a For Sale sign goes up on Frank 's lawn . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day and there 's no car in his driveway , no dog in the yard . No curtains , and through the windows you can see no nothing . The house is empty . How did he get out so fast ? Maybe packed in private for three days , then a moving company took it all while I worked ? I never saw nobody move that fast . <p> Nobody in the neighborhood knows either , but we talk plenty about it . <p> Then about a couple months later I see Eddie Main down in front of the home improvement store . He 's with a box of puppies to give away . <p> Hey , Eddie , I say , and he goes quiet like maybe he should n't talk to me but I can see that for his own money he 'll talk to me fine . <p> I look at the puppies , and there 's just two . They 're really not so ugly . No puppy is ugly . did there used to be . <p> Only three , he says . Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . This one maybe I found him somebody . They keep coming by and looking . I bet they like him but maybe they wanted something prettier . But maybe they 'll come back . <p> I ask him where his family has been living . <p> He says they 're in a rented place in the valley , but now they bought a house in Chicago . <p> Chicago , I say . Wow . Such a long way . <p> Dad says it 'll be better there . <p> It wo n't , but I do n't tell this to Eddie . It will be the same because Frank will bring himself along . <p> Good luck with the puppies , I say . What if nobody takes them ? <p> Dad says at the end of the day they have to go to the pound . <p> Of course . That 's what always happens to the puppies , I do n't say . <p> Next day before work I go to the pound . Sure enough there 's one of Gretta 's puppies , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppies with blue and white coats and blue eyes . With that same goofy look on his face . <p> I say to the pound lady , I 'll take that one . <p> That one , she says . Really . <p> Of course she 's surprised , but he 's my fault . My pighead temper got him born so now he 's my job . <p> But you know , he turns out to be a pretty good dog . Not super smart but smart enough . Not the prettiest dog but the kids love him and he 's a great companion to Blackie and a pretty decent watchdog . <p> I think he gets that from the father side . <p> Author Affiliation
