The Emperor 's Grand Plan // On 2 february 1421 , China dwarfed every nation on earth . On that Chinese New Year 's Day , kings and envoys from the length and breadth of Asia , Arabia , Africa and the Indian Ocean assembled amid the splendours of Beijing to pay homage to the Emperor Zhu Di , the Son of Heaven . A fleet of leviathan ships , navigating the oceans with pinpoint accuracy , had brought the rulers and their envoys to pay tribute to the emperor and bear witness to the inauguration of his majestic and mysterious walled capital , the Forbidden City . No fewer than twenty-eight heads of state were present , but the Holy Roman Emperor , the Emperor of Byzantium , the Doge of Venice and the kings of England , France , Spain and Portugal were not among them . They had not been invited , for such backward states , lacking trade goods or any worthwhile scientific knowledge , ranked low on the Chinese emperor 's scale of priorities . // Zhu Di was the fourth son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ming emperor despite his lowly birth as the son of a hired labourer from one of the poorest parts of China . In 1352 , eight years before Zhu Di 's birth , a terrible flood had struck parts of China . The Yellow River had burst its banks , submerging vast areas of farmland , washing away villages and leaving famine and disease in its wake . The country was still in the throes of a terrible epidemic . The Mongols had ruled China since its conquest in 1279 by the great Kublai Khan , grandson of the greatest warlord of them all , Genghis Khan . But in 1352 , plagued by famine and disease and desperately poor as a result of the depredations of their Mongol overlords , the peasants around Guangzhou on the Pearl River delta rose in revolt . Zhu Yuanzhang joined the rebels and rapidly emerged as their leader , rallying soldiers and farmers to his cause . During the next three years the revolt spread throughout China . Over decades of peace , the once ferocious Mongol warriors , the scourge of all Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissension , they proved no match for the army raised by Zhu Di 's father . In 1356 , his forces captured Nanjing and cut off corn supplies to the Mongols ' northern capital , Ta-tu ( Beijing ) . // Zhu Di was eight years old when his father 's army entered Ta-tu itself . The last Mongol Emperor of China , Toghon Temur , fled the country , retreating north to the steppe , the Mongol heartland . Zhu Yuanzhang pronounced a new dynasty , the Ming , and proclaimed himself the first emperor , taking the dynastic title Hong Wu . Zhu Di joined the Chinese cavalry and proved himself a brave and skilful officer . At the age of twenty-one he was sent to join the campaign against the Mongol forces still occupying the mountainous south-western province of Yunnan , bordering modern Tibet and Laos , and in 1382 he was ordered to destroy Kun Ming , to the south of the Cloud Mountains , the remaining Mongol stronghold in the province . After the city was taken , the Chinese butchered the adult defenders and castrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Mongol boys had their penises and testicles severed . Many perished of shock and disease ; the surviving eunuchs were conscripted into the imperial armies or kept as servants or retainers . // Eunuchs served as ' palace menials , harem watch dogs and spies ' for rulers throughout the ancient world , in Rome , Greece , North Africa and much of Asia , and they had played an important role throughout Chinese history . Surprisingly , they were intensely loyal to the emperors who had authorized their mutilation . There had been eunuchs at the imperial court since at least the eighth century BC and as many as seventy thousand were employed in and around the capital . Only sexless males were permitted to act as personal servants to the emperor and to guard the women of his family and the quarters occupied by his concubines in the ' Great Within ' , inside the palace doors . Emperors retained thousands of concubines both as a symbol of their power and to ensure a number of male heirs at a time of high infant mortality ; guaranteeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital part of Chinese cultural rites . Non-eunuchs , even relatives of the emperor and his consorts , were barred from the vicinity of the women 's quarters on pain of death . The absence of potent males ensured that any children born to the concubines had been sired by the emperor alone . // Eunuchs also helped to preserve the aura of sanctity and secrecy that surrounded the imperial throne . While the gods granted a ' Mandate of Heaven ' to legitimize the emperor 's rule , they could rescind it if he proved guilty of human failings , misgovernment or misconduct . It was forbidden to look upon the emperor : even senior officials kept their eyes downcast in the imperial presence , and when he passed through the streets , screens were erected to shield him from public gaze . Only the ' effeminate , cringing eunuchs ' , slavishly dependent upon the emperor for their very lives , were considered cowed enough to be silent witnesses to his private foibles and weaknesses . // Ma He , one of the boys castrated at Kun Ming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his name was changed to Zheng He . Many of the Mongols whom Zhu Di and his father expelled had adopted the Muslim faith . Zheng He was a devout Muslim besides being a formidable soldier , and he became Zhu Di 's closest adviser . He was a powerful figure , towering above Zhu Di ; some accounts say he was over two metres tall and weighed over a hundred kilograms , with ' a stride like a tiger 's ' . When Zhu Di was elevated to Prince of Yen - a region centred on Beijing - and given the new and more important responsibility of guarding China 's northern provinces , Zheng He went with him . //
