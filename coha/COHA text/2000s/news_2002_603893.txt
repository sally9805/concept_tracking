<p> WIMBERLEY , Texas  --  Five barefoot women sit on the floor , in a circle , here at a home deep in the hill country , more than an hour outside of Austin . Dozens of candles flicker around them . The only movement is that of a gentle breeze blowing through an open window . <p> " Just close your eyes and begin to think about letting go of whatever traveled with you here tonight , " begins Judith Yost , the evening 's host , " so we can be open to whatever the spirit has to tell us . . . to be clear and fully present . " <p> This is not your mother 's Tupperware party . Nor an evening with ever-pink Mary Kay . It 's not even a book club , although what 's being played out here is supposedly replacing book clubs across the country . <p> It 's called a " dream circle , " and if you think that sounds a bit hokey and a little too touchy-feely for you , even the dreamers understand . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " says Melissa Wolf , one of the participants . But they do not . At least not tonight . <p> The women are part of a cutting-edge trend in America that sprang out of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , a trend toward looking inward . Talking about their dreams , in a circle , a couple of times a month , is their ticket in . <p> Dream circles can be traced back centuries to native populations who believed dreams are not individual , but that all our dreams fit together like pieces of a puzzle . <p> Author and spiritual counselor Connie Kaplan of Santa Monica , Calif. , who dubs herself the " grandmother of dream circles , " says she has helped start up 25 such circles in the last year , one just last month in the non-trendy burg of Little Rock . This Austin circle began in June . <p> Kaplan became interested in dreams 16 years ago when an illness caused her to sleep most of the day . She began holding dream circles in her home and is now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness-raising Californians , the circles are now creeping into the heartland . <p> " People have become much more interested in finding ways to self-investigate since 9/11 , " says Kaplan , author of Dreams Are Letters From the Soul : Discover the Connections Between Your Dreams and Your Spiritual Life . " The whole point of a dream circle is to achieve something like the dream state , but while awake . Your breathing slows down , your heart slows down , your blood pressure goes down . It 's like a prayer meeting , meditation . " <p> " What it 's not is group therapy , by any means , " says Yost , a psychotherapist and newly minted New Age minister and dream-circle facilitator . " We endeavor in this process to see how the dream might be collective , more universal , the larger picture . It 's not so much about interpreting the dream , but what it generates . " <p> She begins this evening 's circle by hitting sticks together , then beating a small drum . Twice . <p> Tonight 's group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer/teacher , an office manager and Yost , all in their 40s and 50s . Some are friends , some met Yost through her therapy practice , and some met through sweat-lodge gatherings . There is little small talk , maybe because Yost charges $ 25 a head for each session . <p> Kaplan insists that dream-circle participants are not on the edge or fringe of society . <p> " Our Birkenstock factor is rather low , in fact , " says Kaplan , who describes herself as a soccer mom . She says she often hears from doctors and lawyers who tell her they 've just joined a dream circle . <p> " It 's all about getting insight , " says Wolf , who drives in twice a month from South Austin , about an hour away , to sit Indian-style on the floor with the other dreamers . <p> " We 're holding a certain vibration , " adds Shiila Shafer , a fellow dreamer from Austin . " It gets me out of my personality . I see what others see , a broader view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asks Jean-Jack Morales of nearby Wimberley . " You ca n't change the world without changing yourself . " <p> What happens over the next two hours is the women  --  it 's mostly a female exercise at present  --  sit in a circle and pass a smooth stone counter-clockwise as they take turns telling their most recent dreams . ( The stone carries the energy and memory of their collective dreaming . ) After everyone has spoken , they go around again , talking about each other 's dreams , and what messages they think are being sent . <p> " It takes practice , discipline , " Yost says . " It 's not a parlor game that you think is fun and do once in a while . You establish a practice of opening your being . " <p> It 's not about analyzing or giving advice , she says . " It 's more intuitive . It 's objective , not emotional . " <p> Tonight 's dreams are as varied as the dreamers . There 's a dark one about a suicide pact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about sleeping at the beach , safe and secure buried under sand , while another involves a dreamer being somewhere where everything feels dangerous . <p> Although participants deny it , interpretation appears to be part of the evening to an outside observer . For an hour , the women talk , offering up comments like " I think you were looking for the deepest part of yourself , " and " You 're going back in the womb , protected , covered , " and " Things are n't what they seem . " <p> There 's laughter , too , about a dream in a church from a dreamer who never goes to church . The same woman also never wears powder-blue pantsuits , but did in a dream . <p> Kaplan knows she has naysayers . She admits that one Sunday school class caused quite a ruckus in their church when they decided to become a dream circle . " I think everyone thought there were a bunch of witches gathering . " <p> The skeptics also include the more traditional therapists who deal in dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , says he has no problem with the circles , as long as the dreamers find a " balance . " <p> " If the participants are searching for a sense of community , that 's fine , " Livingston says . " But what worries me is , will that take the place of personal growth ? " <p> But Bruce Goldberg , a hypnotherapist in Woodland Hills , Calif. , and author of the soon-to-be-released Dream Your Problems Away , believes dream circles are " a very healthy process . " <p> " What they 're doing is confronting and conquering any situation that might come up in a dream  --  and with confidence , " he says . " They 're used to take charge of your life . " <p> Even men are slowly joining up . <p> Frank and Annette Hulefeld of Oak Park , Ill. , have been operating their dream circle for about six months now . It began with an all-male dream circle meeting in one room , women meeting in another , but the groups are now combined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men were dreaming , interesting to see the dreams of the divine mother coming through these men , " says Annette Hulefeld , 60 , a clinical social worker . <p> Hulefeld acknowledges that she " could n't always see the big picture . But now you can just feel the energy go through you . The story that has been told has been put right in your lap . " <p> Hulefeld is so into this dream world that she joined Yost and Kaplan this week on a trip to Peru , where they hoped to tap into different messages at sacred sites . <p> " There is a prophecy that the most ancient and secret spiritual truths of the Inca tradition , which were hidden at the time of the Spanish invasion 500 years ago , will become available to certain clairvoyant or receptive people starting in late 2002 , " says Edwin Florez Zevallos , a professor at the University of Cusco who teaches Incan history . <p> Kaplan and her dream followers hope they are those people . <p> " He wants to take us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dream , to see what comes up under those circumstances , " she says . " I ca n't wait . "
