Headnote Online play can help researchers tackle tough computational problems // I 'm online wrapped up on the ESP Game , and I 'm finding it hard to stop . As each round ends , I 'm eager to try again to rack up points . The game randomly pairs players who have logged on to the game s Web I site ( www.espgame.com ) . Both players see the same image , selected from a large database , but they ca n't communicate directly . Each player types in words that describe the image . When the words match , both players earn points and move to the next image . Each round lasts 150 seconds and displays up to 15 images . I keep hoping that my invisible , anonymous partner 's thoughts are in sync with mine-all the better to rise on the list of top players . I 'm having fun , but there 's more to this game than meets the eye . To its inventor , computer scientist Luis von Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and his colleagues , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms that make them easier to find online . Most of the billions of images on the Web have incomplete captions or no labels at all , von Ahn says . Accurate labels would improve the relevance of innige search results and make the information in images accessible to blind users . However , computers are n't good at looking at images and determining what 's in them , and it 's boring for a person to label images . " The ESP Game turns the tedious task of entering words that describe an image into something that 's fun , " von Ahn says . Moreover , the game is addictive , he admits . Since it debuted in late 2003 , more than 100,000 people have registered to play . Some players spend more than 40 hours a week accumulating points at the site . Last fall , Google licensed the game and created its own version , called Google Image Labeler ( **31;5909;TOOLONG ) . " Image-search quality remains a top priority for Google , " says a company spokesperson . The ESP Game is just the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on several new games to solve other problems , such as locating objects in images , filtering content , translating languages , accurately summarizing text passages , and developing common sense . " Computers are really good at solving certain kinds of problems , " says Ben Bederson of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland at College Park . " This offers the opportunity to solve problems that computers just ca n't do . " " People around the world spend billions of hours playing computer games , " von Ahn says . " We can channel all this time and energy into useful work to solve large-scale computational problems and collect the data necessary to make computers more intelligent . " PICTURE PUZZLES Von Ahn first thought of harnessing human brainpower for computational purposes when , a.s a graduate student , he was working on a security scheme to help the Internet company Yahoo ! solve a problem . Yahoo ! permits people to sign up for free e-mail accounts , memberships in groups , and other services . However , people can take advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of accounts automatically and then use the accounts to distribute the uninvited mass mailings known as spam . Working with Carnegie Mellon 's Manuel Blum and others , von Ahn looked for a task that people could do easily but that computers would find difficult . Suppose , for example , that a computer-generated image contains seven different words , randomly selected from a dictionary and displayed so that they overlap and appear against a complex , colored background . A person can almost always identify at least three of the words . A computer program would typically recognize none of them . Blum coined the word captcha to describe such tasks . The word stands for " completely automated Turing test to tell computers and humans apart . " Traditionally , a Turing test is one in which a person asks questions of two hidden respondents and , on the basis of the answers , guesses which of them is a person and which is a computer . In the case of a captcha , a computer generates the test and judges responses to it , but , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many online companies now use captchas to control registration , confirm transactions , check voting in online polls , manage the sale of concert tickets , and other tasks . While thinking about things that people can do but computers ca n't , von Ahn realized that he could take advantage of human capabilities to solve problems such as image labeling . " I toyed around with a lot of possibilities until the ESP Game came about , " he says . It took months to go from idea to working prototype to final version , as von Alm and his colleagues incorporated various features to make the game more useful and more fun . For example , some images have lists of one or more taboo words , which players ca n't use . This encourages players to go beyond the most obvious descriptive terms . " Depending on the image , we can easily end up with 30 words , on average , " von Ahn says . He also collects data on the frequency with which players type in different words-information that may be helpful for improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to sociologists and other researchers . Von Ahn suggests that the game could be varied , for example , by permitting players to choose what sorts of images they want to see . If someone is interested in cars , images of cars will appear more often . " If you see images of things that you 're interested in , you 'll probably be able to give better labels , " von Ahn says . Instead of simply describing a vehicle as a car , a player could go further to identify it as a specific model . It 's a way of harnessing expertise that players might have . Bederson offers one suggestion for making the game more appealing . " I would much , much rather play with people I know , " Bederson says . " The gaming world has shown that games get much more engaging , and people spend much more time playing them and getting into them more deeply , when they have relationships with the people they 're playing . " As currently configured , the ESP Game is a cooperative venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , " von Ahn says , which may appeal to different types of people . WHERE 'S WALDO ? The ESP Game ca n't determine where in an image an object is located . Such location information would be helpful for training and testing computer algorithms for recognizing objects . To approach this problem , von Ahn came up with a game that he called Paintball , in which players shoot at objects in an image . " That was a flop . " he says . " It was n't fun . " Peekaboom ( www.peekaboom.org ) , which debuted in the summer of 2005 , succeeds where Paintball failed . Two randomly paired players are assigned the roles of Peek and Boom . Peek starts with a blank screen , while Boom sees an image and a related word that had been assigned by players in the ESP Game . To provide a clue to Peek , Boom clicks somewhere on the image . Then , a small piece of tinimage appears at that location on Peek 's screen . Peek then types in a guess for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say whether Peek is hot or cold , and provide other hints . When Peek correctly identifies the word , the players switch roles and go on to the next image-word pair . The players continue for 4 minutes . Rapid identifications lead to high scores , so Boom has an incentive to reveal only the areas of an image necessary for Peek to guess the given word . So , if the word is " dog " , and an image has a dog and a cat , Boom would send only those parts representing the dog . Over the course of many rounds , researchers end up with a sense of which pixels belong to which object in any given image . Von Ahn 's latest game to go live , Phetch ( www.peekaboom.com/ phetch ) , is an Internet scavenger hunt in which players look for images that fit certain descriptions . One player , called the narrator , types out a description of a picture randomly retrieved from a database containing 1 million Web images . Then , two-to-four other players , the seekers , use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , the narrator receives points for each successful search and loses points if he or she decides to bypass an image that seems too difficult to describe . The first seeker to find the image receives points and becomes the narrator for the next image . " It sounds like work , " von Ahn says , " but people seem to enjoy it . " In a week of testing , 130 Phetch players generated 1,400 captions . Players spent an average of 32 minutes with the game , but some played for up to 10 hours in a single session . From the results of multiple games , researchers can select the best single caption for an image , determined by factors that include how quickly the image was retrieved . The intention is to provide captioned images to people who are visually impaired . " You 're never going to get a paragraph that you would get out of Moby Dick , " von Ahn says . " The language that you get is similar to the language that you get out of instant messaging . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the caption , you get a really good idea of what s in the image . " COMMON SENSE Von Ahn 's newest venture , now under development , is a game called Verbosity . It aims to build a database of commonsense facts-statements about the world that are known to and accepted by most people . Researchers have long sought to collect common knowledge . In the Open Mind : Common Sense Project ( openmind.media. mit.edu ) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , for example , Internet users enter statements that they consider facts into a database of hits of information . Other activities include explaining why a statement is true , giving a cause-and-effect relationship , and paraphrasing a sentence . The database currently holds more than 600,000 entries , linking many different objects , concepts , and actions . These entries may be used to train reasoning algorithms , which try to make inferences about the world . Scientists view such algorithms as a step toward making computer programs more intelligent . In von Ahn 's game , one player gets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hints take the form of sentence templates with blanks . Suppose the word is " car " and the sentence template is , " It 's a type of . " The first player could then send the hint , " It 's a type of vehicle . " Another template might he , " You use this for . " The hints would constitute facts ahout cars . This game is n't yet ready for prime time because it 's tough to come up with an appropriate set of sentence templates . " To he useful to us , they have to be unambiguous , and they 've got to be fun , " von Ahn says . Verbosity is a great idea , says Henry Lieberman , a member of the Commonsense Computing group at the MIT Media Lab . Von Ahn , Lieberman says , is " a very clever game designer . " Junia Anadeto , who runs an Open Mind project in Brazil , recently created a game that uses knowledge in the MIT common-sense database to generate clues for a guessing game called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ) . Teachers can customize the game to focus on specific topics . Inspired by von Ahn 's work . Dustin A. Smith , one of Lieberman 's students , designed a computer game called Common Consensus , based in part on the structure of a venerable television game show called Family Feud . This Web-based game collects and validates common-sense knowledge about everyday goals . For example , a question might ask , " What are some things that you would use to watch a movie ? " The players would reply with a list of objects , such as a DVD player or an iPod . The more players who mention the same object , the more points they get . ART OF FUN Some aspects of creating what von Alm describes as " games with a purpose " are more art than science . There 's no simple formula for making something fun , for example . " That 's something that still requires a lot of creativity , " von Ahn says . " The only way that we know that something is fun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree on what 's fun , and what 's fun today may not be fun tomorrow . All von Alms games have a time limit . " It makes players go faster , which is what I want . " von Alm says . " It gives me more data . " Von Ahn has also noticed that keeping the time short increases participation . Given 5- and 10-minute versions of a game , a 5-minute round is played more often , and more people play the game for longer than 10 minutes . Cheating can bias or taint the results in which researchers are interested . " I worry about it a lot , " von Ahn says . " Before launching a game , I think very carefully about any way that I can imagine of cheating , and I come up with mechanisms to stop it . " Bederson says that von Ahn " has done an admirable job at addressing these issues . I do n't think there 's any evidence that people have been able to subvert these systems . " With all these factors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 18 months . Von Ahn is developing a Web site that only features games in which players provide useful data for researchers . The most popular , well-known games would attract visitors , who might then be tempted to try other games . Von Ahn sees applications of this sort of game beyond computer science and artificial intelligence . " It could be a new business model , " he suggests . " Rather than charging people to play your games , you let them play for free , and your business is the data that the games collect . " Bederson is already looking toward games of the future . " The big challenge is how to scale this approach up to more-complex problems , " he says . Examples of such problems include summarizing or explaining literature , providing services in ways that meet an individual 's particular needs , or handling situations in which the truth is n't known-all tasks that require human judgment . Fun is n't the only way to tap human brainpower . " People want to help the world , and they typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're often willing to do really hard things if they have legitimate reasons to think that they are doing good in the world . " Imagine what people might be willing to tackle through a combination of entertainment and personal fulfillment .
