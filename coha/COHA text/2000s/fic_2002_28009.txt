Everything in Tibet starts with the wind . It is the wind that offers up prayer flags to the heavens , the wind that brings cold and warmth and life-giving water to the land , the wind that gives movement to the mountains themselves as it sends the clouds careening down the ranges . As he looked out from his high ledge , Shan Tao Yun remembered a lama once suggesting to him that the human soul first became aware of itself in Tibet because the wind never stops pushing against its inhabitants , and it is in pushing back against the world that a soul is defined . After nearly four years in Tibet , Shan believed it . It was as though here , the highest of all lands , was where the planet , gasping and groaning , began its rotation , here was where it learned to move , here was where it was the most difficult for people to hold on . There was an exercise for enlightenment Shan had learned from the lamas that was called scouring the wind . Extend your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindful of the world it carries and absorb its lessons . He and his companions had hours before darkness fell , before it was safe to travel again , and he sat cross-legged on his high perch and tried it now . Drying heather , Shan sensed . A hawk soaring high over the valley . The sweet , acrid scent of junipers , tinged with the coolness of snow . The distant chatter of ground squirrels on the rock-strewn slopes . And suddenly , before a spreading plume of dust in the north , a single desperate rider . As Shan shielded his eyes to study the intruding figure , a sharp syllable of warning cracked through the air . He turned to see Jowa , his Tibetan guide , pointing to an old man in a broad-brimmed brown hat walking toward the edge of the ledge , staring up the valley . " Lokesh ! " Shan shouted and leapt to grab his old friend , who seemed not to notice when Shan grasped his arm . He was blinking and shaking his head , staring at the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it real ? " Lokesh asked in a tentative tone , as if uncertain of his senses . The day before , he had seen a giant turtle on the top of a hill , a sign of good luck . He had insisted that they take it an offering and apologized because it had turned back into a rock by the time they had reached it . " It is of this world , " Shan confirmed as he squinted toward the horizon . " He 's frightened , " Jowa said behind them . " He keeps looking back . " Shan turned and saw that the wiry Tibetan had found their battered pair of binoculars and was studying the figure through the lenses . " That horse is dead if he keeps it up . " The Tibetan looked back to his companions and shook his head . " Someone is chasing him , " he said in a worried tone as he handed Shan the glasses . Shan saw that the rider was clad in a dark chuba , the heavy sheepskin robe worn by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwestern Tibet . Behind the dropka 's horse the dust was so thick that Shan could see no sign of a pursuer . He scanned the landscape . Snowcapped peaks edged the clear cobalt sky for miles in three directions , towering over the rugged grass-covered hills that lined the opposite side of the valley . Neither the long plain below them , brown with autumn-dried grass , nor the narrow dirt track from which they had retreated at dawn , gave any sign of life other than the solitary rider . Shan could see the man 's arms now , flailing his reins against the horse 's neck . He looked down at their battered old Jiefang cargo truck , hidden behind a large outcropping a hundred feet from the road , then handed back the binoculars and stepped into the shadow of the overhanging rock where they had taken shelter after their night 's ride . Ten feet away , where the shadow was darkest , Shan dropped to his knees . By the ashes of the small fire where they had roasted barley flour for their only hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been thrust into a tiny cairn of stones . A blanket of yak felt had been folded and laid on the ground , and on the blanket , sitting silently in the cross-legged lotus fashion , was a man in a maroon robe . He had close-cropped graying hair , and his thin face would have been called old by many , but Shan never thought of Gendun as old , just as he never thought of mountains as old . The lama 's eyes were mostly closed , in what for him passed as sleep . Gendun refused to rest during the night , while they traveled in the old truck , and he did not lie down in the daylight rest shifts taken by his three companions but only drifted off like this , after Lokesh had made sure he had eaten . " Rinpoche , " Shan whispered , using the form of address for a revered teacher . " We may have to leave , " he said . " There is trouble . " Gendun gave no sign of hearing him . Shan looked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape beyond the rider , then turned back to Gendun , noting for the first time that the lama had arranged his fingers in a mudra , one of the hand shapes used to focus meditation , a symbol of reverence to the Buddha . He studied the lama 's fingers a moment . The wrists were crossed , the palms held outward , with the little fingers linked to form the shape of a chain . Shan paused and stared at the hands . It was an unusual mudra , one he had never seen Gendun make . The Spirit Subduer , it was called . It chilled Shan for a moment , then he sighed and rose with a slight bow of his head , stepping back to Jowa 's side . The young Tibetan was looking up the slope above them , as though searching for a way to climb over the mountain . They both knew that there was probably only one reason the rider was so scared . Shan looked once more at the truck . Their only hope was that it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stopped here , high on the remote plateau , short of their destination . Not simply because of the suffering they would face from the Public Security Bureau , but because they would have failed Gendun and the other lamas who had sent them . Lokesh sighed . " I thought it would be longer , " he said , and touched the beads that hung from his belt . " That woman , " he said absently , " she still has to be settled in . " Settled in . The words brought back to Shan how different they all were , how differently they seemed to view the strange task that had been set for them . Gendun had been with the lamas who had summoned Shan from his meditation cell in their mountain hermitage , seated on cushions around an eight-foot mandala that had just been completed that afternoon . Four monks had worked for six months on the delicate wheel of life , composed of hundreds of intricate figures created of colored sands . Fragrant juniper had been burning in a brazier , and dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like distant thunder rose from a chamber below them , the sound of a huge prayer wheel that required two strong monks to turn it . For a quarter hour they had gazed in silent reverence at the mandala , then Gendun , the senior lama and Shan 's principal teacher , had spoken . " You are needed in the north , " he had announced to Shan . " A woman named Lau has been killed . A teacher . And a lama is missing . " Nothing more . The lamas were shy of reality . They knew to be wary of facts . Gendun had told him the essential truth of the event ; for the lamas everything else would be mere rumor . What they had meant was that this lama and the dead woman with a Chinese name were vital to them , and it was for Shan to discover the other truths surrounding the killing and translate them for the lamas ' world . He had not known how far they would travel , and when he had arrived as instructed at the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that it would be to the north end of the Lhadrung valley , to the settlement nearest the hermitage . Nor had he realized that Gendun was to accompany him . Even when Gendun appeared at the door , Shan had thought it was to bid him well or offer details of his destination . He had even assumed that the canvas bag of supplies the lama had brought was for Shan . But then he had seen Gendun 's feet . The lama had removed the sandals he always wore under his robe and replaced them with heavy lace-up work boots . They had walked until dawn , when they had met Lokesh at the ancient rope bridge that spanned the gorge separating the hermitage from the rest of the world . Lokesh and Shan had embraced as old friends , for such they had become during their time together in Lhadrung 's gulag labor camp , then the three had walked another hour until a truck had stopped for them . Shan had thought it was just a coincidence , just a favor from the driver . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the vehicle with wide eyes , having never been so close to a modern machine , the lama had blessed first the truck , then Jowa , and climbed inside . Jowa had eyed Shan resentfully , then started the engine and driven for twelve hours straight . That had been six days earlier . Shan had been confused from the outset , waiting each day for the clarification from Gendun that never came . But Lokesh had never seemed to doubt their purpose . For Lokesh their job was to resettle the dead woman , meaning that they must address her soul and assure that it was balanced and ready for rebirth . For Lokesh , the woman had to settle into her death the way the living , after a momentous change , had to settle into life . Not her death , really , for to Lokesh and Gendun death was only the reverse side of birth . But a death not properly prepared for , such as a sudden violent death , could make rebirth difficult . When a monk in their prison had been suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigil for ten days , to help the unprepared spirit through the period when it would discover it needed to seek rebirth . Shan gazed toward the valley floor again . The rider continued his breakneck speed , bent low now , as if studying the ground . Shan looked at his companions with grim frustration . " Perhaps , " Shan said to Jowa , " it is one of your friends . " Jowa had been a monk once himself . But the Bureau of Religious Affairs had refused to give him a license to continue as a monk , and a hard shell had grown around the monk inside him . Jowa was n't worried about resettling a soul . A teacher had been killed and a lama was missing , things that the Chinese did to Tibetans . Jowa had simply understood that they were being sent against an enemy . Shan studied him now as Jowa unconsciously rubbed the deep scar that ran from his left eye to the base of his jaw . Shan had known many such men during his years in Tibet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way such men turned their heads when encountering a Chinese on the street . He knew the scars made by the Public Security troops , the knobs , who were fond of wielding whips of barbed wire against public protesters . The hard labor brigade from which Shan had been released four months earlier had been heavily populated by men like Jowa . It had taken less than a day on the road from Lhadrung , however , for Shan to understand that the essential truth about Jowa was something else . As the former monk had stealthfully exchanged passwords with the horsemen who had taken them away from the Lhasa highway , Shan had realized that Jowa was a purba , a member of the secret Tibetan resistance , named for the ceremonial dagger of Buddhist ritual . He had replaced his monastic vow with another vow , a pledge to use up the rest of this incarnation in fighting to preserve Tibet . " No , not one of us , " Jowa replied curtly . " Not like that , " he added enigmatically . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in a low , urgent tone . " I will lead them away on a chase to the south . Gendun and Lokesh can not move fast enough . Just climb higher and hide . " " No , " Shan said , watching the rider . " We stay together . " Lokesh sat near the edge of the ledge and stretched , as if the approaching threat somehow relaxed him . He pulled his mala , his rosary , from his belt , and his fingers began reflexively to work the beads . " The two of you have strength , " the old man said . " Gendun needs you , both of you . I will stay with the truck . I will tell the soldiers I am a smuggler and surrender . " " No , " Shan repeated . " We stay together . " As much as he needed Jowa for his wisdom of the real world , the world of knob checkpoints and army patrols , he needed Lokesh for his wisdom of the other world , the world the lamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's world to get to the place of death , once they arrived Shan knew he would be seeking answers in the lamas ' world . Lokesh would have been a lama himself except that long ago , before the Chinese had invaded , he had been taken from his monastery as a novice to serve in the government of the Dalai Lama . Shan watched Jowa remove the canvas bag that hung over his shoulder and his thick woolen vest , then wrap his hand around the pommel of the short blade that hung at his waist . Jowa would not speak about the priest within him , but at their campfires he sometimes spoke proudly about his bloodline that traced back to the khampas , the nomadic clans that tended herds in eastern Tibet , a people known for centuries as fearless warriors . Jowa no longer watched the rider but the cloud of dust behind him . Soldiers would have machine guns , but , like thousands of Tibetans before him , Jowa would rush them with only his blade if that was what it took to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . " Why is he staying on the road ? " Jowa stepped to his side and slowly nodded his head . " You 're right , " he replied in a puzzled tone . " If someone chased one of the nomads , first thing he 'd do , he 'd get off the road . " As he spoke , he swept his hand toward the wilderness that lay beyond the rough dirt track . They were in the wild , windblown changtang , the vast empty plateau that ranged for hundreds of miles across central and western Tibet , a land where the dropka had hidden themselves for centuries . Lokesh cocked his head , then looked toward the opposite end of the valley , to the south . " He 's not running from someone . He is running to someone . " They watched as the rider sped past the outcropping that hid their truck , reappeared , then abruptly reined in his horse . As the horse spun about in a slow circle , the dropka studied the road . " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did , for Chinese eyes . " The rider dismounted and led his mount toward the outcropping . Moments later he stood by their empty truck . After tying his horse to the bumper , he warily circled the vehicle , then climbed to the edge of the open cargo bay , his hand on one of the metal ribs designed to support a canvas cover over the bay . He stepped inside and lifted the lids of the barrels that stood there , then jumped out and studied the slope above him . Most of the slope was covered with loose scree , fragments of rock broken from the ledge above . Winding through it was the solitary goat path which they had climbed after leaving the truck at dawn . " Sometimes the soldiers have Tibetan scouts , " Jowa reminded Shan . He touched Shan on the shoulder , motioning him into the deep shadow of the overhanging rock . The dropka began climbing the path at a fast trot . Shan fought the temptation to pull Gendun to his feet , to scale the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , they had identity papers . But no one could explain Shan or Gendun . Gendun , who had lived so hidden from the rest of the world that Shan had been the first Chinese he ever met , had no official identity . Shan , on the other hand , had suffered from too much official scrutiny . A former government investigator who had been exiled to slave labor in Tibet , his release from the gulag had been unofficial . If captured outside Lhadrung , he would be considered an escapee . Jowa pushed Shan against the rock in the darkest part of the shadow , beside Gendun , and waited in front of them , his hand on his blade again . The man reached the ledge where they hid , took a few steps in the opposite direction , then turned and came straight toward them . When he reached the rock , he stepped toward the shadow and shielded his eyes to peer inside . " Are you there ? " he called loudly , in a voice edged with fear . The man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mop of black hair and a faded red shirt under his chuba . He twisted his head and squinted , as though still uncertain of what lurked within . Predators made lairs in such places , and so did the demons that lurked in mountains . He looked back toward the northern reach of the road , as if searching for something , then pressed his palms together in supplication and stepped into the darkness . " We say prayers for you , " he called out , still in his loud , frightened voice , then halted with a sigh of relief as Lokesh took a step forward . His mouth moved into a crooked shape that Shan thought at first was a smile , then he saw that the man was choking off a sob . " For your safe journey . " Lokesh was the most emotional Tibetan Shan had ever met , and he wore his emotions like other people wore clothes , in plain view , never trying to obscure them . In the prison barracks Shan had shared with Lokesh , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flared up unexpectedly , fanned by a rush of emotion or sudden realization . When the embers flared , snippets of sound , in croaks and groans and even squeals , escaped him . The sound he made now was a long high-pitched moan , as if he had seen something in the man that scared him . As the sound came out he shook his hand in front of his chest , as though to deny something . Jowa stepped beside Lokesh . " What do you want ? " he demanded loudly , not bothering to hide his suspicion of the man . No one was to have known about their journey . The man looked at the purba uncertainly , then took another step toward them . But as he did so Lokesh shifted to the side and the dropka was suddenly face to face with Shan , who stood in front of Gendun , hiding him from the man 's view . " Chinese ! " he gasped in alarm . " What do you want ? " Jowa repeated , then stepped out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The herder followed Shan and Lokesh out of the shadows , then circled Shan once and looked back at Jowa . " You bring a Chinese to help our people ? " he asked accusingly . Lokesh put his hand on Shan 's shoulder . " Shan Tao Yun was in prison , " he said brightly , as if it were Shan 's crowning achievement . The anger in the man 's eyes faded into despair . " Someone was coming , they said . " His voice was nearly a whisper . " Someone to save us . " " But that 's what our Shan does , " Lokesh blurted out . " He saves people . " The man shrugged , not trying to conceal his disappointment . He looked up the valley , his right hand grasping a string of plastic beads hanging from his red waist sash . " It used to be , when trouble came , " he said in a distant voice , as if no longer speaking to the three men , " we knew how to find a priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon and decided to address it . " We had a real priest once , " he said to the cloud , " but the Chinese took him . " His expression was one Shan had seen on many faces since arriving in Tibet , a sad confusion about what outsiders had done to their world , a helplessness for which the proud , independent Tibetan spirit was ill-prepared . Shan followed the man 's eyes as they turned back up the valley . Someone was emerging from the dust cloud , a rider on a horse that appeared to be near collapse . The animal moved at a wobbling , uneven pace , as if dizzy with fatigue . " When I was young , " the man said , turning to Lokesh now , with a new , urgent tone , " there was a shaman who could take the life force of one to save another . Old people would do it sometimes , to save a sick child . " He looked back forlornly at the approaching rider . " I would give mine , give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , stepping closer to study Lokesh 's face . " You have the eyes of a priest . " " Why did you come ? " Jowa asked again , but this time the harshness had left his voice . The man reached inside his shirt and produced a yak-hair cord from which hung a silver gau , one of the small boxes used to carry a prayer close to the heart . He clamped both hands around the gau and looked back up the valley , not at the rider now but at the far ranges capped with snow . " They took my father to prison and he died . They put my mother in a town but gave her no food coupons to live on , and she starved to death . " He spoke slowly , his eyes drifting from the mountains to the ground at his feet . " They said no medical help would be given to our children unless we took them to their clinic . So I take my daughter with a fever but they said the medicine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we found a boy and he had no one and we had no one , so we called him our son . " A tear rolled down his cheek . " We only wanted to live in peace with our son , " he said , his voice barely audible above the wind . " But our old priest , he used to say it was a sin , to want something too much . " He looked back toward the second rider , his face long and barren . " They said you were coming , to save the children . " A chill crept down Shan 's spine as he heard the words . He looked at Lokesh , who seemed even more shaken by the man 's announcement . The color was draining from the old man 's face . " We are going because of a woman named Lau , " Shan replied softly . " No , " the dropka said with an unsettling certainty . " It is because of the children , to keep all the children from dying . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second horse staggered forward , then stopped . Its rider , wrapped in a heavy felt blanket , slumped in the saddle , then slowly fell to the ground . The herder let out a sound that was n't just a moan , nor just a cry of fear . It was a sound of raw , animal agony . Shan began to run . He ran in the shortest line toward the fallen rider , darting to where the path met the ledge , then leaping and stumbling down the loose scree of the slope , twice falling painfully on his knees among the rocks , then finally landing on all fours in the coarse grass where the valley floor began . As he rose he glanced over his shoulder . No one followed . The exhausted horse stood quivering , its nose , edged with a froth of blood , nearly touching the ground beside a mound of black yak-hair felt . Shan slowly lifted an edge of the blanket and saw dozens of hair braids , a bead woven into the end of each . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight braids , one hundred eight beads , the number of beads in a mala . The woman was breathing shallowly . Her face was stained with exhaustion that they seemed not to notice Shan . Inside the blanket she had used as a cloak was another blanket , around a long bundle that lay across her legs .
