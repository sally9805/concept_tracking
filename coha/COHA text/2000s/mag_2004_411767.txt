The ability to pick a baby 's gender leaves many parents thrilled with the outcome-and some experts worried about ethics // Tommy and Dana Paschal married in 1982 and were soon blessed with three baby boys . They were a happy , healthy family-even though , from time to time , Dana felt a little something , or someone , was missing . " I do n't think she ever stopped wanting a girl , " says her mother , Pauline Ferguson . " She was just afraid to try again . " Then , in August 2000 , Dana picked up a magazine while strolling through her local Kmart . Inside was an article about a medical breakthrough that would allow couples to choose the sex of their babies . " I called my husband and said , " I think I know how we can get our girl , ' ' " says Dana , 36 , a homemaker from Pleasant Garden , N.C. Her family scrapped plans for a cruise to the Bahamas , opting instead to try having a daughter through an experimental sperm-sorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that allowed specialists to remove those with female chromosomes . Dana was then artificially inseminated and , after two attempts , became pregnant . On Oct. 12 , 2001 , Dana , Tommy , now 38 , and the boys-T.G. , 18 , Kevin , 16 , and Michael , 12-welcomed Heather Rene Paschal . " We got exactly what we wanted , " says Dana , who paid $5,300 for the procedures . Not so long ago , of course , no amount of cash could have bought the opportunity to decide the sex of your child . Even today many Americans object to what they see as parents playing God . But in the past few years-quietly at first and now through services touted on the Web-a growing number of fertility experts around the country have begun offering clients the ultimate form of family planning . " Personally , I think sperm sorting is a great idea , " says Sonja Kristiansen , 41 , a Houston fertility specialist who has helped two dozen couples choose the sex of their kids using the technology known as MicroSort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl she can dress up and Dad wants a boy to carry on the family name . I already have two boys , but if I were to get pregnant again , I 'd have a girl . " Since clinical trials of this procedure began in 1994 , it has produced about 500 pregnancies and 420 babies , according to the Genetics and IVF Institute , based in Fairfax , Va. , which holds the MicroSort patent . Some couples , like Nina and Rob Wagoner of Ventura , Calif. , have opted for preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) , a more complex and expensive method-it averages $15,000 per attempt-in which doctors screen a fertilized embryo for its sex and genetic disorders , before implanting it in the mother . In 2003 the Wagoners , parents to three girls from Nina 's previous marriage , read about PGD on the Internet and decided to try for a boy . Doctors implanted a total of three embryos , and Nina eventually delivered twins last Nov. 7-Jared and his sister Jordan . Tm still in shock , " says Nina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Jared is here . " Like the Wagoners , many couples see the new technology as an invaluable tool either for so-called " family balancing " or for guarding against sex-specific diseases . But some in the medical community advise caution . A number of doctors who offer gender selection refuse to perform it for first-time parents or those who do n't need reproductive assistance . Others are concerned that if unused embryos are n't frozen or donated , they 're discarded . And antiselection critics say manipulating sex sets a chilling precedent that could one day lead to a generation of " designer kids . " " Children are not products you can buy like pets , " says Boston University bioethics professor George Annas . " Why not select for eye color , height and strength ? This is treating children like commodities . " Aware of possible moral objections , Kathy and Cliff Krug , a couple from Fairfax Station , Va. , debated for six months before finally deciding to use sex selection in the wake of a pair of devastating events : Four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , was born with hemophilia , a hereditary disease that predominantly afflicts males . A third son , their doctor told them , would carry a 50 percent chance of having the disease . Then , two years later , Kathy 's 62-year-old mother died of breast cancer . " I felt like it would be great to have this little girl to replace my mom , " she says . Both the Krugs are observant Catholics . They prayed for guidance but eventually decided not to consult their priest before joining a clinical trial for sperm sorting in October 2002 . Kathy began taking a fertility drug and used a home predictor kit to determine when she was ovulating . When that day arrived , she and Cliff , who works for their family-owned moving business , hurriedly drove to the Genetics and IVF Institute near their home , where Cliff 's sperm were sorted , then tested and artificially inseminated into Kathy . Even after she became pregnant , though , the waiting was n't entirely over , says Kathy , because the MicroSort method has a 91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 76 percent for boys ) . " We waited 20 weeks to have a sonogram , " she says . " The technician was quiet and I thought , " Oh no . " But she turned and said , " It 's a girl , " and we were so excited . " The Krug 's daughter Abigail Anne was born July 10 , 2003 . " Now I 've got my partner in crime , " says Kathy . Despite the moral qualms of many , gender selection is almost certain to grow , say some experts . " The vast majority of patients are average suburban parents who have two or three children of one gender and say they want another of the opposite sex , " says Norbert Gleicher , who performs PGD at offices in New York and Illinois . " What is wrong with that ? " Nothing , say Jose and Claudia Quintero of Miami , who have three daughters and , thanks to sperm sorting , a bouncing toddler named Joseph . " We thought about everything-our kids , our religion , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that it was worth it , " says Claudia . " And it was . He 's a miracle .
