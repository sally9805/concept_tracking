While I was at the Albuquerque airport bar-pueblo turquoise and sandstone-waiting to meet my girlfriend , a woman offered to buy me a drink . She was better than goodlooking . We each ordered a frozen margarita , did a salud , and I walked her politely to her gate , and she kissed my lips as she went to the plane at the very last minute-she had a first-class seat . I came back to the bar and ordered both a shot and another margarita . In less than fifteen minutes my girlfriend 's plane was supposed to arrive . It was one of those days when I was a man . My head was shaking when a starched white shirt and tie , coat slung over the shoulder , came up to me . <p> " George " he said . His speech was timid and a little too formal . It was always hard for me to figure out these guys who wore business suits . " You do n't remember me ? From El Paso . Austin High ? " <p> It took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was right . I stood up and shook his hand harder than he did mine . " How 's it going , Daniel ? " I said his first name with a Spanish pronunciation , un-Americanized . I was conscious of this immediately , and I was sure he remembered me as the guy who did n't like it back in the old days when an Anglo coach or teacher would say it their way , like they were right and the other was wrong . I was still that same guy , even though my own legal name was Jorge , like my father and his father . It 's just that I did n't happen to like my name in Spanish . I thought George was better . And that was always my point , anyway : our choice , not theirs . <p> Danny and I went to Austin High School a hundred years ago , though we did n't hang out together . He was a better student than me , and that was probably why we never had any of the same classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crockett , and that was enough for us to know each other forever . It must 've been around sixth or seventh that we separated off . We played on the same Little League team one season . He was left field , sometimes third base . I played short and pitched . He was fast , I was strong . We made the city playoffs that year . <p> " So you get back much ? " I asked . <p> " I 'm living there , " he said . <p> " Really ? " Everybody who grew up in El Paso hated it and left when they could , as soon as possible . There was nothing to do , and no jobs , let alone good-paying ones . If you were raised there , it seemed like any other city was better . You sensed this if you had n't ever gotten away , and knew when you had . The best thing about El Paso was that people thought you were cool and tough for growing up there . <p> " It 's what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving El Paso was for good . Moving back was almost unheard of . There were two possible explanations . You had no choice-desperate , tragic economics-or your parents , who of course were still there , were old , and somebody had to take care of them . That was cultural , and the best part of El Paso . " You actually have a job , El Chuco ? Pues , que haces hay ? " <p> " I 'm a newspaper editor . " <p> " Like a reporter ? " <p> " No . Though I used to be a reporter . I did that in Dallas , then in L.A. I took the job in El Paso as the paper 's editor . " He looked at me carefully , like he was wondering if I was aware how much his suit was worth . " I was the first Hispanic to have it . " <p> " First Hispanic , huh ? " <p> He caught my sound like he did when I pronounced his name . It 's an ancient discussion made new again-who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were " Spanish , " how they called us years ago , this one implied the light-skinned Iberian Peninsula , too . No one I ever knew in El Paso , Tejas , dark or guero , had a single relative from pinche Spain . These words were a way to avoid saying you had Mexican descent , that Mexico was too low-class . Even if it was out of public fashion , I felt like I was the last one to still say I was a Chicano . Maybe it was a dead issue left over from the old days , but not to me . <p> " Congratulations , " I told him , letting it loose . " That is great . I bet El Paso 's up to like ninety percent of us Mexicans by now . Que duro , that town . Yeah , it 's about fucking time they noticed us living there . That 's great . You got ta be proud . You should be . " <p> I 'd made him happy . <p> " I ca n't imagine the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . " Did they ever ? " <p> " It was bad . Gangs and graffiti stories . Sometimes about how to make tamales . " <p> Even as he told me this he was somber , too dry . " So you 're kicking ass . That 's great , Danny . " <p> " I did all right . " He paused and looked off . <p> " Really , " I said . The pause was loud . I told him about my art . <p> " What 're you doing here ? " he asked . <p> I 'M locura , " I said . " I 'm broke , but I got a girlfriend ... ' <p> " I saw her , " he said . <p> " You saw her ? " <p> " Yeah , you lucky bastard . " <p> " You mean that woman at this bar ? " <p> " Could n't miss her . " <p> " She ai n't her , man . My baby has n't gotten off the plane yet . ' He laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's coming in from Denver , and I 'm waiting here for her plane . ' <p> " And this other , you just met her ? " <p> " She lives in New York City and says she was out here for a shoot . Do you believe it ? Says she 's a model . Sat right up next to me and started talking and shit . ' <p> " What a lucky bastard . If I were you I 'd go out and buy a stack of lottery tickets immediately . You may never be so hot again as long as you live . " <p> " Sabes que , Daniel , tienes raz6n , that 's smart business advice " Smiling , we were both shaking our heads now . My girlfriend 's 747 was gleaming in the windows as it approached the gate . The bar was directly across from it . <p> " So what 'd you mean ? " I asked . " You get fired from your job or something ? " <p> He sighed , surprised , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I quit . I decided I had to move on . " I was watching for my girlfriend . <p> " I need that job right now , " I said . " So , que te paso ? You burned out on El Paso ? " <p> " El Paso 's all right . It 's not Albuquerque , but it is getting better . <p> You should come down . You could stay at my place . ' He started watching for my girlfriend , too . " No , it was a woman . Romance , love . ' He was n't sure I was listening , and I was n't . " So I decided to quit . " <p> " Hay viene , " I said . <p> " That 's her ? " <p> " Yeah . ' <p> " You are a lucky bastard. , You find two , and I ca n't even keep <p> , Bien fed verdad ? " <p> " You lucky bastard : ' <p> " I am , I know . Pues , tambien , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head like I was before he came up to me . " Let me give you my number before you take off , " he said . " Visit anytime . Especially now : ' <p> " You do n't know what you 're offering , dude . I may be sleeping on your couch next week . No traes una business card or something ? " " It 's old ... " He touched the wallet in his back pocket , and he <p> felt around for a pen in his jacket , and he stared at my girlfriend standing over there . " Do n't you think you better get her ? " <p> I followed her eyes as her body pivoted , searching for me in the long , well-lit aisle beyond the darkened airport bar . " Let her find me . She will any minute , watch <p> " You 're too much . " He pulled out his wallet and scribbled on the back of a card . <p> I was pocketing it as she saw me . The eyes closed , the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it stopped , she moved with a huge grin toward me . <p> Not a month later I was at his apartment . He 'd offered it to me for the utilities while he was in Mexico and Central America for the next six weeks . The timing was magic potion-I could n't pay the rent on my studio , had n't in two months , and my landlord was n't a patron of the arts . <p> " This here is some view , " I said . " You forget the big picture , you know , of where you 're from . " I held on to a wooden post on the wide old wooden deck of this old plastered apartment , below me the compact El Paso downtown , and the darkened slot that was the concreted Rio Grande , and Ciudad Juarez beyond that , and then the blackened plain of the desert . The lights of the city all around shook like moonlight broken up in a calm lake . <p> " If this were L.A. , " Danny said , handing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be Mulholland Drive , and it would cost beaucoup . " No cans of American for him , only the imports . <p> " A chingo of bucks , for sure " I translated . Maybe his Spanish was n't so perfect anymore and that was why he avoided using itall of us spoke English best , began leaving the other in the house once we were old enough to ride a bike a few blocks-but , though I did n't know why , he was still thinking about being Mexican somehow : Besides the beer , he played Tejano music on the stereo , and a black felt sombrero was on the wall . <p> " So what 's going on with your women ? " he asked . I took a swallow . " Women ? " <p> " The ones I saw . " <p> I 'd forgotten about the one at the bar . " She called me once . Told me to come to New York : ' <p> He interrupted . " Is she a Latina ? " <p> I was n't sure what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's una de los que , one of those que do n't even know how we say California . Do n't know ni una palabra of Spanish . ' <p> " She was sexy . ' <p> She was a good-looking woman , I remembered , but I had n't thought about her . <p> He laughed too loud and finished his bottle , chugging like a frat boy . " You want another ? " <p> I was only half done . " Sure " I said . I gulped mine down as we moved inside to be agreeable . " My problem is Lisita . You know , la otra . " <p> " She 's a beauty , George . " He shook his head as he plucked off a bottle cap like this took strength . It bounced on the ceramic tile counter and onto the floor . I picked it up . " She 's not a Latina , is she ? " He handed the bottle to me , and attacked another with his opener . <p> Here we were standing , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant labels . " No , pura white girl , and not Latina . " I could n't help mocking that word ever so subtly , even though I realized this was n't a time for a disagreement over something so stupid . " I only call her Lisita . Her name 's Lisa , " " She was a beautiful woman , she really was a beauty . " He looked at me like he was about to say something important , but drank instead . <p> Danny was getting buzzed . He was drinking so fast , already almost finishing the beer he 'd just opened . <p> " Does it matter to you ? " he asked . " Does it matter if she 's Anglo or Latina ? " <p> " My wife was from here . Pura chuquena . She went to La Jeff . " <p> " So this Lisa , who 's married , right ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " You two are serious ? " He spoke like he was doing an interview . <p> " Depends on what room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even smile . <p> " It always gets serious , no matter what it starts like . ' <p> Danny went for another Negra Modelo without offering me one-I 'd barely sipped this one yet-and we went to the living room . It had two wooden-Bashed windows on the south wall , and they were open , and wind blew enough for the shades that were half-down to lift and slap . There was a big couch against another wall , and across from it the TV set and a stereo system and a few racks of CDs and cassettes and a tall , stuffed bookcase . His desk was a scratched-up dining room table with a computer on it pushed against the wall and under the windows . That was where he sat . I took the couch . <p> " Pretty comfortable , " I said . " You might have to worry that I wo n't let you in when you get back . ' <p> " Use the computer if you want , " he said . " I never write a postcard . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably set up outside on the porch . If that 's okay . " There really was n't enough room inside . I 'd been expecting a much bigger place , probably because I assumed Danny made big bucks . " Of course . ' <p> " I 've never been one to paint outdoors before . " <p> " You 'll have to watch out for the wind , " he said . The shade puffed out with it . He was draining this next bottle too fast , too , though he did seem to be slowing down in another way , sinking into the swivel chair at the dining room table . " It 'll blow hard . ' <p> " I swear , you 're like divine intervention , " I told him . " I 'm supposed to be getting money by the end of the month . I did n't want to have to borrow money . " <p> " It helps me out , too , " he said . " It 's better if somebody 's here . The thieves , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He got up for another beer . " So what are you planning after this ? " he said from the kitchen . " You going back to Albuquerque ? " <p> " Sabes que , I really do n't know . La cosa es que , I really do n't . ' He sat down again and set the beer on the table-maybe to let his arm rest . He rubbed his eyes . <p> " So what about you ? " I finally asked . " You do n't exactly seem pumped about going . " <p> " I guess it 's obvious , " he said . <p> " Pues , you did drink all the beers . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> " I 'm joking , dude . " <p> " I am sorry . I am . Oh . Yeah . Well . I 'm sorry . " Shaking his head , but not in wonder . " It 's because of Mary . " <p> I felt like that might be where he left it . " Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of to say . <p> " She lives in Albuquerque . " <p> " That 's what you were up there for ? " <p> " Well . Yeah . Mostly " <p> " You broke up . " <p> " It 's been going on . We tried for almost five years : ' I did n't say anything . <p> " She was an Anglo girl " <p> That took me by surprise . Not that she was , but how he said she was . <p> " All I ever wanted was to get married . I wanted a house . I wanted a couple of kids . I wanted to read the Sunday paper in an overstuffed chair . " <p> " Really . " I was n't sure what else to say . " I could n't understand . I ca n't . " " What does she do ? " <p> " Teaches art . ' <p> " She could 've moved here for that . " <p> " She likes her job . I could n't get my job up there in Albuquerque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm happy as an editor . I 'm good , too . But I decided I had to move on . I had to take some risks . I have to do more . " <p> " And so that 's why you 're taking this trip to Mejico ? " <p> " Mostly . " He was drinking more reasonably now . Sips . " Be a man . <p> " Be a man ? " <p> " Yeah . Have adventure . Stop thinking like a soft editor . What I was did n't work , you know . It did n't work out . " <p> " You 'll meet another woman . I 'm sure of it . You ca n't miss . " <p> " Yeah , probably . Maybe when I 'm down there . A woman from my own culture . " <p> I sipped some beer . He sipped some beer . <p> " What do you think ? " Danny asked . " You think it 's better we stay with our own ? " <p> This all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Indian his dark face was-the eyes , the nostrils . The deep , quiet frown . He did n't wait for me . " I love that woman , I still love that <p> woman . I just do n't know why she does n't love me . " <p> What could I say ? <p> " See ? I get mad one minute , sad the next , " he told me . " You done ? " <p> " I guess so . ' <p> I was almost finished with mine , he was only halfway on his . He carried them into the kitchen . <p> " I got a futon in here , " he said at a closet . He took it and two sheets and a blanket out for me . He went into his bedroom and came out with a pillow . " I 'll be getting up early in the morning . Finish packing , make a couple of phone calls . " <p> I unrolled the futon and threw one sheet over it . The wind was blowing with a gritty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible power and beauty . It reminded me of what I missed about El Paso . The simple things . Sun , and moon , and stars , and dirt , and wind . Day and night . Before I turned off the lamp , I grabbed the pillow he 'd put on the couch : I could n't believe how filthy it was , so much so that its dirty gloss bled through the white pillowcase . I did n't even want to put the back of my head on it , so I used the blanket for that instead , and pulled the other sheet over me . <p> It was early in the morning when we got up . Too early for me , but I did n't say so . I rerolled the futon and folded the sheets and the blanket and put them in a pile on the couch , pillow on top . Danny packed , and I read magazines . He had every magazine in print , months of them , three big piles . It was what he was going to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . He 'd bought cushioned nylon bags for his camera and lenses . He worried about his laptop , using it , losing it . He needed to make some calls at his desk , the table . No , he said to me , it 's okay , you can stay . First it was his mom and dad . In case he did n't come back , he told me , if anything happened . He called his sister and his brother . He talked to each of them for a long time about his career . He sounded confident , self-assured . I wanted to leave , take a walk , but I did n't want him to worry about me , because I was driving him to the airport . He was worried about so much . This trip , which so many people I knew had taken , worried him . His flight was to Mexico City , where he was meeting up with a friend , and then they 'd travel in a jeep together . The city worried him , driving through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , reading , studying photos , while he was in the bedroom . He was a long time in there . When he finally came out he asked me if I was ready . Everything but the ticket , I said . He had most of his belongings in a backpack . I carried a small tote down the apartment stairs-we were loud , and it echoed on the hardwood floors-and we stopped for Mr. Palacios . I 'd sort of met him the day before , when I got here . The old man had opened the door and asked if I was looking for someone . He knew everything , Danny had told me . He saw everything , every coming and every going . He liked to talk . As we got to the bottom of the stairs , near his door , it opened , and Danny introduced me . He explained how I 'd be staying there until he got back . Mr. Palacios nodded . Andale , bien bien , ni modo , mucho gusto . Though I knew we were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and all . He did n't think so , he told me . He was born in Parral . No relatives here except his wife . I knew we were n't , I said , I was just joking around because we had the same last name . He went on , not reacting . She 'd had two children previous . They 'd had one , a man with a family of his own now , and lost one . We have to go , Danny interrupted . Down the front building stairs , and we tossed his bags in the back of my pickup . We got on I-io and headed for Airway Boulevard . It was warm out , but the wind was still blowing , so the windows were only cracked . <p> " I wanted to call her . I had this overwhelming urge to call her . " " It 'd be all right if you did . " <p> " I wanted to tell her . I hate that I ca n't talk to her . This does n't even matter , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even go on this trip . It is n't what I want . I would n't need to go if , you know , if we were together , or going to be . " <p> " You should call her , dude . Call her from the airport . You 'll have plenty of time . I 'll bet she 'd like it . " <p> " I just ca n't . " <p> " That 's not so bad , either . Maybe you should n't . But , sabes que , it 'd be okay if you did . You guys were together what , five years ? " <p> " I wanted us to live together . An apartment for a while . I want <p> ed her to live with me . I thought she 'd agree to that . " <p> " But she did n't . Well , you 're both working . Distances . Es bien duro . " <p> " Tell me what you think about this . That in all the time , in all that time , she never once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my window down , anyway . " That 's , well , I 'm not sure what you 're saying . " <p> " That she never did . Not once . " <p> " But you guys were together a lot ? Went places ? " My real thought was about sex . <p> " We had great times . Especially the first years . Lots of fun . We loved being together . And I know she did . I know . It 's why I do n't understand . ' <p> " Well , " I said , " I think you should make the best of this trip . Get away for a while . I think shaking it up is good . And , de todos modos , you told me how you can get jobs everywhere . This either works out for you , or you get another good job after you get back . Either way , dude . " <p> I double-parked near a skycap booth for his airline . We said goodbye to each other hurriedly , shaking hands . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sleepy and did n't want to start working yet . I lifted up the pillowcase and I looked at the pillow again . Dead was the only way I could describe it . It once had silky , blue stripes , and then I remembered , with sudden clearness , having a pillow exactly like this when I was maybe ten years old , even younger . It was my favorite pillow . It was probably my mom 's first . She 'd given it to me when she got a new one , or when one was ruined , and she bought a pair . This could be the same pillow , decades later . I went into the bedroom . His other pillow was a match . He had two of them . Two dead , decomposing pillows , discolored not by stains or misuse but by age , the passage of time . He 'd been given them , by his mom , and they were n't torn , and he kept them . He did n't notice how black the white stripes between the blue had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them so long , for so many years , and he 'd kept them , and could n't see that they needed to be thrown away . <p> The couch , if comfortable , was old , unattractive , indistinctive . Not damaged in any way , not a tear , not a spill , but it had n't been cleaned ever either , and it was turning brown , a black film on the armrests from the oil of human hands . Everything in the apartment , it occurred to me , was like the couch . Furniture that functioned but was never more than functional new . Never beautiful , never worth taking care of , not worth paying attention to but for the function . Like particleboard with paper veneer , it would never be " antique " or " kitsch . " And all of it brown like the walls , the ceilings , like the shades . Nothing with brilliant color . Not a red , not a white , not even a faded bright color . Except for that sombrero , the walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing . <p> I imagined his Mary on the bed . She is passionate , wanting , in the throes . I imagine her body all alert , hear her breathing fast , feel her perspire , and she reaches , climbs , and peaks . When she is spent , as she drops back into time , naked , her blood still rushing , when her head-eyes and nose and mouth-rests on one of these disgusting pillows . <p> The two pillows I bought at the department store were n't the cheapest , but close . I liked them . The covers had a satiny sheen , in a pattern of long-stemmed , leafy flowers . I went ahead and bought a set of sheets with pillowcases , too . The clerk put them in the biggest bag I 'd ever been given . The pillows were plump , overripe , bursting . The front door of the apartment building was locked , and the key to the apartment did n't fit . I had to ring the bell . Mr. Palacios came . <p> " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like the bag barely fit through the door . " I guess he forgot . " <p> " It 's only locked at night . " <p> " You think I could get one from you ? " Mr. Palacios was n't sure . <p> " You do n't have an extra ? " <p> " I 'll have to ask Mr. Nevarez , the owner . " <p> " I 'll pay you if you want . " I reached for my wallet . I took out five dollars . " When you get a chance . " <p> He took the cash . " New pillows , " he said . <p> I swore he wanted to open the bag and touch them . I swore he wanted to talk about these new pillows . <p> " Look at it this way , " I told Lisita . " She 's either an artist or she teaches it . So she loves beauty . She lives for the idea of beauty . She desires it . Can you see what I 'm saying ? What other reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose he has n't tried to make it better ? " <p> " He told me . He thought of this place as temporary , and five years later he 's still here . " <p> " Is he a good-looking man ? " <p> " He is . And he 's in good shape . He 's athletic . " " Those are the worst pillows I 've ever seen . " <p> " I ca n't imagine a woman getting in a bed with those pillows . I ca n't imagine a woman wanting to , even to take a nap . " <p> " It is an awful bed . " She rocked up and down on it . " How are we going to sleep on it ? " <p> " But you see what I 'm saying about beauty , right ? Do n't you see the conflict ? Say she has this Just , this sexual passion , which is the raw form of what drives us into art in the first place , and she 's here , with these pillows , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is absent of what she deeply wants and loves most : ' <p> Lisita had stopped listening . " How do you know they were here all the time ? " <p> I had n't even considered that . <p> " It 's a bachelor 's pad . You 're being hard on him . He 's a guy . " <p> " Pues , I 'm a guy , you know . " <p> " Palacios . " She was still on the bed . She was waiting . <p> " What I mean ... ' I stopped for a few seconds : Lisita was so uniquely sexy that it caught me once in a while . She was pure want of woman , something powerful and undeniable and not visible . " Lo que digo , I mean I do n't go around saying this all the time . I 've never worried about pillows before . " <p> " I care about pillows . You 're right about that . Women care more about pillows than men . I like these ones you bought : ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That I never realized how much I take it for granted in my life . Put it this way . I want a woman to like getting in my bed . " <p> " Shut up about your women . " <p> " It 's not what I 'm saying . " <p> " Oh , Palacios . " <p> " What I 'm trying to say is that lots of men do n't know about women . That a woman wo n't fall in love with a man that does n't care about beauty . " <p> " Oh , Palacios , " she said , crawling up on the bed . " Are you going to get on this bed with me , Palacios ? " <p> I do n't know what I loved most about making love to Lisita . What I think of is her face . That punishing shock of desire all over it . So pleasurable it scared her . I loved making love to her , loved making her love it . <p> " I 'm leaving these pillows , " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the sheets , though . I do n't want him to ... well , you know , and I do n't want it to seem like a personal thing . " <p> " He could 've put his best ones away . " <p> " I 'm thinking he 'll see these new pillows ... " <p> Her fingers traced the small of my back and the top of my butt , and she sighed as her breasts pressed against my chest , and she kissed my neck , under my ears , to my lips . " I love being with you , " she said . " I love it too much . ' <p> It was early evening when we got out for a drive . I took her over to the neighborhood , by Austin , the high school Danny and I went to , and I stopped my truck across the street from where I grew up , a stone house that was painted white when I lived there and had been repainted pink . Lace curtains in the windows . There was a cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Corolla in the rutted driveway . The house was so much like all the others , and as still as a photograph twenty-five years old . I was full of this selfish pride , full of a private joy about our neighborhood , about our culture . I lied . I did n't tell her it was my house but that it was an old friend 's . <p> The next three days we drove under that desert sun and sky , moon and stars , in the wind and air . We drove up the river through the cotton fields and ate rellenos at Chopes and swung back and drove down to the San Eli mission , smelling the burning skin of green chile all around . We ate at Kiki 's and Delicious and Lucy 's , and we walked El Paso Street across the bridge and onto Juarez Avenue , and we drank at the Kentucky Club . We hiked , until we were out of breath , up a loose rock path in McKelligon Canyon to a high point where my dad buried our dog when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected by agave and ocotillo . We drove slow past the brick house over by Washington Park where my wife grew up and where we 'd lived together with her parents those first years . I 'd wanted to go , get away , so bad . <p> And , like those first days , and the others when she flew down , it was the bed , my sheets , with the pillows . Her breasts and waist and hips , nipples , lips , lengua , nalgas , panocha . Never enough . <p> " It 's so wonderful here , " she said . " El Paso is such a sweet town . I could live here . We could live here . " <p> I did n't say . <p> " I love you , " Lisita said . " I want to be with you , " she said . <p> No , I decided not to . Not for the obvious , that he 'd be offended , that he 'd take it as a personal criticism . Which would be bad after he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it . It just seemed like too much for him to suddenly learn . Not the embarrassment of realizing that he 'd been sleeping on disgusting pillows , even offering them to guests . Much as that might be too much , too . But no , it was n't that . It was if he did see it as I did . The revelation of the repulsive truth . And yes , I did believe it was absolutely true , an easy call . I did . He would look at these new pillows , and he would look at those dead ones , and he would think of the years that had passed , how he 'd wasted so many , how simple it might 've been and how he 'd messed up . No , I did n't want that responsibility . I did n't want to be the one . I could n't be sure how he , how anyone , would take it , would respond . <p> I had to get them out of the apartment and into my truck . At first I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up from the side of the house . Which would have kept Mr. Palacios from seeing me go down the stairs with them , unless he saw what I did do , and that would be much worse , much more memorable . I already worried that he would tell Danny about the pillows , anyway . The day you left , I could hear him say , he bought these two pillows that he carried upstairs in the biggest sack I ever saw . After six weeks , I 'd learned there was no telling when he might be awake , and when he was awake , and he heard , he opened the door . Though he did n't need to open the door every time . In the afternoon to early evening it was usually already open . He had the TV on , a Mexican station blaring . I worried about walking them down in the middle of the night , too , because I did n't want him to rush out and open the door then , either . In my stocking feet , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless he saw me , and with the pillows . He 'd cracked it open on me between two and three a.m. a couple of times . Once he 'd met Lisita , he asked me about her every time I came down without her , which had been most of the days I 'd been staying in the apartment . <p> I was making it too big a deal ? Exaggerating the possibility of Mr. Palacios seeing me ? If I did , I did , and , anyway , I finally figured it out : I took the clothes out of my suitcase and put the pillows in and zipped it up . I walked down the stairs . <p> I heard the door opening . " Moving out ? " Mr. Palacios asked . <p> I kept my hand on the suitcase handle , but rested it on the floor . " Daniel 's here tomorrow night . He 's taking his apartment from me . ' <p> " Tomorrow night ? " <p> " Yeah , " I said , " so I 'm getting my things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my truck . Left it , and I went back . Mr. Palacios 's door was wide open now , and the TV was on . I brought down a couple of easels , my paint boxes . After a couple of those trips , I unzipped the suitcase and took the pillows out and went back to the building with it empty again . <p> I passed his door and up the stairs , and when I looked behind me I saw him standing under the threshold watching me go up . I made two other trips . Then I repacked my clothes in the suitcase . He was standing at his door , suspicious . " You forgot something ? " <p> I acted guilty . " Yeah " I laughed . <p> Now he watched me more carefully . A few hours later , when I was moved out , I cleaned up what mess I 'd made , and I locked the door behind me . <p> " You mind giving him this key when he gets here ? He told me it 's a spare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the other , too . " He looked them both over . " Tomorrow night ? " <p> " He 's supposed to be here tomorrow night . ' We both waited . <p> " Well , it was good to meet you , Mr. Palacios . " <p> Author Affiliation
