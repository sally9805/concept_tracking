Some kids dream about being in a rock band . Dave Grohl dreamed of being in every rock band . " As a kid , my fantasy was that I would go to a concert , any concert , and something would happen to the drummer , " says Grohl , 34 . " The lead singer would look out into the audience and say , ' Is there anyone out there who knows how to play our songs ? ' And , of course , they 'd have to pick me . " <P> Now Grohl is another rock god living his dream . At 21 he was drumming for Nirvana , and after front man Kurt Cobain 's suicide , he moved center stage as guitarist and lead singer for the Foo Fighters . In the past year , Grohl has also played drums on every track of acclaimed albums by heavy-metal rockers Queens of the Stone Age , female singer-songwriter Cat Power and goth princes Killing Joke ( whose first album in seven years , Killing Joke , is out this week ) . Grohl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Costello at the Grammys and been floated as a possible replacement for John Bonham on a Led Zeppelin reunion tour . " My everywhere-ness , " Grohl says , " is kind of freakish  --  even to me . " <P> Like most modern adventures in ubiquity , Grohl 's begins with Puffy . In 1998 , P. Diddy called Grohl and asked him to do a remix for his song It 's All About the Benjamins . Grohl says , " I was like , ' Well , I do n't know how to do a remix . ' And he basically said , ' Do whatever you want . ' So I got a drum set , a guitar and a bass and made some rock music , and they put it under the song . That was my first collaboration . " <P> Since then Grohl has got dozens of calls from bands looking for an expert fill-in drummer ( inexplicably , bands go through drummers as fast as drummers go through groupies ) and the cachet of having a former member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for much cash , but he is moderately selective . " It 's great to jam with other people ; inevitably you learn something , " he says . " But to make it more than just throwing Legos together to see what you can build ... I try to work with people I respect . " <P> Rather than bring his frenzied Nirvana style to each project , Grohl strives to blend in . He usually spends a week or two in the recording studio ( " Anybody who spends more than a few days laying down drums is an idiot , " he says ) and takes his cues from his collaborators ' melodies . On Queens of the Stone Age 's throbbing , bass-driven Songs for the Deaf , Grohl set the frantic pace and then stayed out of the way , while on Cat Power 's You Are Free his style is more impressionistic , adding a layer of sadness to the songs . For Killing Joke 's reunion album , Grohl went back to his punk roots and banged away .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
