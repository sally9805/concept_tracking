An integral part of the patient care provided by a healthcare facility takes place outside of the exam or treatment rooms . During a patient 's hospital visit , and potentially months after being discharged , the patient will interact with hospital staff  --  in person , by phone , or by mail  --  to deal with the monetary charges incurred for the medical care received . A facility 's system for handling patient information and billing records provides a postvisit opportunity to deliver quality patient care . <p> Because billing is one of the contact points between a healthcare organization and its patients , " an orderly , effective , understandable billing and collection system is not only viewed as essential to profitability but can be a positive marketing tool " ( Hemmer 1992 , 12 ) . The process component of medical services , which includes the system for handling patient information and billing records , has been identified as providing opportunities to deliver better-than-expected care . Quality of care and increasing patient satisfaction can be addressed by focusing on the aspects that patients are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Public dissatisfaction with healthcare billing is frequently in the news . A study of patient complaints over a seven-year period , conducted by the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , found that one-fifth of patient complaints were associated with billing and payment , making this the third-highest source of complaints ( Pichert et al . 1999 ) . Patients are tired of confusing billing statements and are challenging hospitals to " get billing right " ( Bell 1999 , 36 ) . <p> Bills are not the only potential source of dissatisfaction . Healthcare managers must aim to ensure that their customers have positive encounters with facility employees , including billing office staff . " The greatest influence on a patient 's perception of a hospital is the quality of the interactions between the patient and the staff at the point of service " ( DeBaca 1990 , 30 ) . More often than not , the last impression a patient has of a healthcare provider is influenced by his or her interaction with the billing office . RESEARCH OBJECTIVE <p> The goal of this research was to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction with a facility 's billing process . The results suggest areas for improvement and the issues that tend to be most important in the patient 's overall evaluation of the facility . More important , we illustrate an evaluation process and tool that may be useful to hospitals in their efforts to improve the quality of their billing process . Study Design <p> The data for this study were based on responses from 496 patients at seven facilities , each in a different state , representing both inpatient and outpatient experiences . A questionnaire was mailed to a sample of patients discharged in the previous two to nine months . We chose a mail survey method to reduce cost ( Press and Ganey 1989 ) and acquiescence bias ( Hall 1995 ) . <p> We derived the survey questions from input from quality improvement managers and finance managers from various healthcare facilities as well as from the literature on hospital billing . The survey included questions about bills received , interaction with business office staff , billing procedures followed , and personal issues dealing with the patient 's understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table 1 ) . The final section of the questionnaire evaluated the " overall rating of the billing process . " <p> Patients rated each billing issue using a 5-point Likert-type response scale with the following anchors : very poor , poor , fair , good , and very good , where 1 represents very poor and 5 very good . This response framework was selected because it met the requirements of the balance and uniformity of rating concept ( Vavra 1997 ) . The responses were then transformed to a 100-point scale ( 1 = 0 , 2 = 25 , 3 = 50 , 4 = 75 , 5 = 100 ) , to aid interpretation and facilitate the detection of even small changes in patient satisfaction . <p> The questionnaire also included background questions to help identify sources of variation in ratings of service . These background questions included such things as out-of-pocket expenditures , number of billing office mailings in the last three months , and whether the patient received bills from multiple sources ( lab , physician , hospital ) for a single visit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a questionnaire measures what it is supposed to ) was evaluated by conducting a principal component factor analysis using a Varimax rotation on the variables . This analysis generated a relatively clean , five-factor solution . The factors were labeled bills for service , staff , procedures , personal issues , and overall ratings and reflect the sections of the questionnaire ( see table 2 ) . The last factor , " Overall rating of the billing process , " loaded on the same factor as the bills-for-service questions . That suggests that patients tend to associate the question with an evaluation of the actual bills received , rather than viewing it as an overall evaluation of the facility . Principal Findings <p> After excluding the summary items from the " overall ratings " section of the questionnaire , we found that respondents gave the highest mean ratings to the following billing issues : courtesy of business office staff , helpfulness of business office staff , and answers given to billing questions . Likelihood of using the services of the hospital again received the highest overall mean score ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other factors in addition to billing influence patients ' responses to this question . Notably , although the majority of mean scores on the billing questions are in the 60s and 70s , patients gave higher mean scores for the likelihood that they would use the services of the hospital again ( 83.3 ) and that they would recommend the hospital to others ( 80.1 ) . That suggests that patient dissatisfaction with billing-related issues is not a strong indicator that the patient would avoid using the hospital again or recommending it to others , perhaps because of a high level of satisfaction with the care received in other areas . <p> The billing issues receiving the lowest mean scores were level of detail provided , description of specific charges , and patient 's knowledge of what charges the insurance company has or has not paid ( based on the bill provided by the hospital ) . The lowest scores identify areas for potential improvement , but it may be inappropriate to expend resources on low-scoring issues if they are not important to the patients . <p> One method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how closely related a score for an individual service issue is to the patient 's overall rating of the billing process . This correlation analysis identified the following five billing issues as the most closely related to the overall rating of the billing process : ( a ) help provided in exploring payment options , ( b ) staff knowledge of billing issues , ( c ) staff solutions to patients ' problems , ( d ) help provided in understanding the bill , and ( e ) helpfulness of business office staff . Excluding the overall items , the correlation of the survey questions with the likelihood that the patient would recommend the hospital to others is not as high as their correlation with the patients ' overall rating of the billing process . Variation in ratings of billing based on Patient Experiences <p> Ratings of the billing process differ based on the experiences and characteristics of the patient . These relationships shed additional light on the potential sources of satisfaction with the billing process . <p> Age of patient . Older patients tend to be more satisfied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p &lt; .001 ) . The youngest age group ( 0 to 17 years of age ) gave a mean score of 61.8 , while the oldest age group ( 80 and over ) gave a score of 79.8 for the overall rating of billing process . Although this pattern is consistent with previous research that finds that patient satisfaction increases with age ( American Health Consultants 1998 ) , it may also reflect something unique about the healthcare financing of this group . It appears that the older patient population pays less out-of-pocket expenditures , which could be a factor in their higher satisfaction with the billing process . They are also more likely to use Medicare financing . <p> Type of insurance . Rating of the billing process tends to be lowest among patients who pay for the services themselves or rely on some form of HMO or managed care . Medicare-insured patients , as a group , gave a comparatively high overall rating of the billing process , which further emphasizes the age differences noted earlier ( see figure 1 ) . <p> Of the six types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Medicare insurance represent over 80 percent of the patients . When we compare patients with these three types of insurance on selected items , we continue to find greater dissatisfaction with billing issues among the HMO and managed care patients . For both accuracy of bill and level of detail provided , HMO patients gave the lowest ratings and Medicare patients gave the highest ( see figures 2 and 3 ) . <p> Out-of-pocket expenditures . A negative relationship is found between increased out-of-pocket expenditures and patient satisfaction with the billing process ( r = - .26 , p &lt; .001 ) , indicating that higher expenditures are associated with lower levels of satisfaction . The mean score on the overall rating of the billing process is 78.8 for those who pay nothing out of pocket , 63.5 for those who pay between $1 and $499 , and 59.8 for those who pay $500 or more . One interpretation of these findings is that patients who must pay for hospital charges are more likely to be involved in the billing process and are therefore more likely to encounter difficulties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from multiple sources ( 56 percent of the survey group ) appear to be less satisfied than patients who receive one bill from a single source ( F = 3.37 , p &lt; .07 ) . For those patients who received a bill from only one source ( the hospital ) , the score for the overall rating of the billing process is 73.6 . For patients who received bills from multiple sources ( hospital , physician , lab ) , the overall rating is 67.1 . <p> However , it appears that patients with bills from multiple sources are less satisfied only when they pay nothing out of pocket ( see figure 4 ) . Of those patients with no out-of-pocket expenditures , the mean score on the overall rating of the billing process for those who did not receive bills from physicians and labs is 82.6 , while the mean score is only 76.9 for those who did . However , if patients do have out-of-pocket expenditures , their satisfaction with the billing process appears to be higher if they also receive bills from physicians and labs . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean score for the overall rating of the billing process is 60.9 for those who did not receive physician and lab bills in addition to hospital bills and 66.0 for those who did . Among patients with out-of-pocket expenditures of $500 or more , the mean score for this question is 55.0 for those who did not receive bills from physicians and labs , but 59.7 for those who did . <p> These results suggest that patients who are responsible for paying some of the hospital charges out of their own pockets are more satisfied with the billing process if more detail is provided to them in the form of physician and lab bills in addition to the hospital bill . Conversely , for patients who are not paying any of the hospital charges out of their own pocket , receiving fewer bills is viewed as better . <p> Total number of mailings received from the billing office . The more bills the patient has received , the lower the satisfaction with the billing process ( r = - .33 , p &lt; .001 ) . Among those patients who indicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the previous three months , those who received one mailing during that period gave the highest mean score ( 82.6 ) on the overall rating of billing process . Apparently , as the billing process drags out , the patient becomes more dissatisfied with the progress toward resolving the bill or more frustrated with attempts to get it paid . The mean score on the overall rating of the billing process is just 48.3 for patients who received six or more billing office mailings . Managerial Implications <p> As with all consumer experiences , a healthcare provider 's billing process plays a role in maintaining good customer relations . Our study suggests some areas where managers might best direct efforts to improve overall patient satisfaction with billing . Although these findings provide some suggestions for the industry , they primarily illustrate the efforts that individual facilities should make in evaluating how their patients rate their billing process . <p> Identifying the billing issues that have highest and lowest ratings and understanding their relationship to the patients ' overall rating of the facility is the first step in improving service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey vital to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of service delivery , it also can , through the comments and recommendations made by the patients , suggest actions that should be taken . <p> It is also important to note that there was considerable variation among facilities in the ratings given by the patients . The lowest overall score received by a facility was 57.0 , while the highest was 87.4 . In addition to looking at the scores themselves , facilities will benefit if they can benchmark their scores against the averages for other hospitals . The mean overall score for all facilities was 71.4 . <p> Finally , billing must be put in context with the larger healthcare experience . Billing is often seen as a " retail " issue and not a critical , life-saving patient care issue . If patients view care as superb , billing issues will likely have little effect on their likelihood to return . However , billing issues may be the differentiating feature for facilities that are average in other respects . ( Remember , the majority of facilities are average  --  meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being equal , a patient 's experience with a facility 's billing process can affect whether the patient will recommend the facility to others or choose to go back to that healthcare provider in the future . The bill is the last contact that the patient has with the facility . Care should be taken to manage it well .
