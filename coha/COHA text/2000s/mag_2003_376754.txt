Jerry Rowland feels the dragon breathing down his neck . He 's the CEO of National Textiles , a T-shirt maker in a state that has lost more than 37,000 textile jobs since the U.S. lifted quotas on Chinese imports two years ago . Unless Rowland 's North Carolina workers suddenly become competitive with Chinese counterparts who earn just a few dollars a day , he fears his employees will be next . The plainspoken Southerner ticks off what he regards as China 's unfair advantages : excessive government protection , an underpriced currency , cowed and underpaid workers , exports dumped below cost . If Washington wo n't help , Rowland says , he will have to move some jobs overseas . The new quotas slapped on some Chinese textiles last month , he contends , are n't enough . " Our government has done nothing , " says Rowland , " just a little bit of hand slapping . " <P> Half a world away , Yang Rong manages the privately run Jinhua Asset Underwear Co. , with a factory tucked into verdant hills a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sexiest lace bras . On his shop floor , surrounded by 200 young workers outfitted in pink kerchiefs and aprons , Yang points to the wall on which he has taped a laminated list of rules issued by Walt Disney Co. , with which Asset Underwear has a contract to make clothing featuring Disney characters . The list prohibits , among other things , indentured servitude and " slavery . " Yang thinks that 's funny . His laborers come from villages across China to work 8-to-10-hour days for up to $120 a month and consider that a pretty good deal in a nation where urban per capita income is $78 . Looking up from her C cups , Lou Xuxiao , 20 , brags about the new electric moped " I never thought I 'd own . " <P> While Yang is sowing prosperity in China , the U.S. 's new penchant for protectionism could bust his big plans for brassieres . Asset Underwear , which grossed $10 million in exports last year , recently began negotiating with Sara Lee , maker of Playtex and Wonderbra , to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese bras , bathrobes and knit fabrics have forced the Chicago company to withdraw . Yang is mystified . " Why ca n't the Americans stick to making what we ca n't ? " he asks . " For little things like bras , nobody can compete with China . " <P> Right you are , Mr. Yang , which is why the U.S. 's uneasy embrace of globalization is chafing against China 's emergence as the world 's workshop . China rules in stocking stuffers , but it 's climbing the technology ladder too . Its huge pool of cheap labor  --  up to 500 million peasants are expected to migrate to cities in search of factory work over the next two decades  --  should provide 20 more years of growth for an economy that already produces a quarter of the world 's television sets and washing machines and half of its cameras and photocopiers . U.S. towns built on products that seem uniquely American  --  think A.T . Cross pens from Lincoln , R.I.  --  have been devastated as employers moved whole factories to China .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
