ASTRONAUTS ARE PEOPLE who ride rockets into space . They must train for a very long time before they go . Astronauts must be brave and smart . <p> Will you be an astronaut ? <p> The biggest rocket ever was the Saturn V. On the launch pad it was taller than a thirty-story building . Today 's rockets are smaller and lighter . Today 's rockets can be launched more than once . They have wings and can come back to Earth and land like airplanes . <p> When a rocket engine blasts out flame and smoke , it is so loud that windows rattle and the ground shakes . Everybody knows when astronauts are traveling to space . <p> Antonio is strapped into his seat . He is about to ride to a space station . Because there is no air in space , Antonio must wear a space suit . In the suit , Antonio can breathe and talk over radio . He wears a helmet with a special faceplate that protects him from the sun . The fingers of his gloves have tiny claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket is about to take off . There go the engines . 5-4-3-2-1 ! Lift off ! <p> Astronauts come from many countries . Antonio is from Mexico . Other astronauts come from Ecuador , Colombia , Brazil , the North American Diaspora , El Salvador , and other countries . Astronauts must be able to work well with others . They also must be good at math , computer science , and engineering . <p> In space , astronauts speak Spanish . No matter what language you speak at home , you must learn Spanish if you want to be an astronaut . <p> ? ( inverted ) Habla espanol ? <p> Mercury was America 's first manned spacecraft . It was smaller than a car and could hold just one man , all scrunched up . Gemini was more roomy and could take two men into orbit . And the Apollo spacecraft was even larger . It could take three men to the Moon and back . <p> On July 20 , 1969 Apollo 11 brought the first astronauts to walk on the Moon . There are no plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink or air to breathe . Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin conducted experiments and talked to people on Earth . They collected many Moon rocks , but their spacecraft was lost while returning to Earth . Space exploration is dangerous . <p> Astronauts must be very brave . Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made one giant leap for mankind . <p> Will you be an astronaut ? <p> Antonio 's rocket docks with Space Station Vigilancia . The space station circles 19,000 kilometers above the Earth . It also has rockets to help it move out of orbit . In some ways , the space station is like a spaceship . It is shaped like a big donut with a needle through the center . Antonio 's rocket links up with the space station at the bottom of the needle . He rides an elevator up to Vigilancia 's living quarters . <p> The living quarters are small but comfortable . Antonio cooks some of his own food in a kitchen and grows some of it in garden  --  bubbles . He sleeps in a hammock and exercises with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleeping or exercising , he watches movies and plays games , just like you do at home . <p> Antonio replaces another astronaut . The old astronaut will ride back to Earth in the rocket that brought Antonio . Antonio will remain on Space Station Vigilancia for nine months . During that time , he will finally get to put all his training to use . He will use telescopes and other instruments to watch for incoming Asps . If he sees an Asp , he will track it with radio waves , and if it gets close enough he will blast it with the space station 's proton guns . Antonio has practiced doing this on Earth for a long time . He is very good at it . It is a great responsibility to be an astronaut , protecting Earth from Asps . <p> If even a single Asp gets through , millions of people could die . <p> How did Antonio become an astronaut ? Astronauts come from all kinds of places . They come from big cities and small cities , from mountains and jungles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , the place where Antonio 's parents lived . They had to move to the refugee camp where Antonio was born . <p> Here is Antonio in the refugee camp . He is standing in line at the depot . At the depot he is given a box with food in it . It is enough food to feed Antonio for a week . Antonio eats bean cakes and fruit paste and crackers with peanut butter . <p> Every time Antonio picks up a box of food , the people at the depot ask him questions . <p> " How do you spell rocket ? " asks a man . <p> " R-O-C-K-E-T , " says Antonio . <p> " Very good , " says the man . The man is from Africa and works for the United Nations . He writes something in his notepad and asks Antonio another question . <p> Antonio can spell many words . <p> P-R-O-T-E-C-T . <p> E-A-R-T-H . <p> H-U-M-A-N-I-T-Y . <p> L-O-Y-A-L . <p> Not all the questions are about spelling . Some are about math . Antonio can answer those easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " pretend " questions . <p> " Antonio , pretend your best friend is hungry . He has already eaten his crackers . When you go to the clinic to get your shot , you see a food box that someone has left by the door . The person who left it there must not be hungry , since they were so careless . Your stomach is rumbling . Do you eat the crackers , or do you give them to your best friend ? " <p> Antonio says , " I tell the nurse there is a food box by the door . " <p> The man says , " Very good , Antonio . " <p> All Antonio 's answers are entered in the notepad . After a while , people know that Antonio is very smart . When he is twelve years old he is chosen to attend astronaut school in Rio de Janeiro . It is a great honor to be picked for astronaut school . It is important to study hard . Always speak intelligently to adults . Do n't be afraid of big words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee camp , and he is very sad . <p> His father hugs him . " Be good , " says his father . <p> " You will make us proud , " says his mother . <p> Antonio flies to astronaut school in an airplane . <p> He will miss his parents when he is at astronaut school , but he knows he is learning how to protect them from Asps . <p> It is okay to be sad when you help other people . <p> The Earth is beautiful . When Antonio has free time he looks through one of the space station 's windows . Antonio learned geography at school in the refugee camp , and he learned even more at astronaut school . He sleeps with a picture of Earth over his hammock . The Earth is the most important thing there is . <p> Antonio sees blue ocean beneath the white clouds . The Gobi Desert is the color of a camel . The tip of Cape Horn is white like a polar bear . North America is green and brown , but parts of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash gray . Across China is a patch of ash gray . <p> The gray parts are where Asps have touched down . More than two billion people used to live where the patches are . But nobody lives there now . There are no people , no animals , and no plants in the patches . Over two billion people have died in the patches since man started going into space . Many more have died because the people in the patches grew food for others to eat , all over the world . Now their farms are gone . <p> People like your parents have died . People like your brothers or sisters have died . People like your teachers and friends at school have died . Dogs and cats and fishes and hamsters have died . <p> Do you have a pet ? <p> An astronaut 's most important job is to prevent people and animals from dying . An astronaut will do anything to save a life . <p> On the space station , Antonio controls the guns . Here he is at work . He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dentist 's chair ? Antonio 's chair has a gyroscope inside it . If something hits the space station , Antonio will remain steady . That 's the gyroscope 's job . An astronaut must be able to concentrate on his job no matter what . <p> From his chair , Antonio controls twenty guns at once . The guns are satellites with little rockets that control their movements . Each gun is as big as a tram car . Some of the guns are very far away . Some are out beyond the Moon . Antonio aims and fires his guns with radio signals . <p> Some astronauts will spend their entire time in space without ever firing a shot . But they 're still working . Firefighters are working even when there is no fire . Police officers are working even when nobody is committing a crime . Cleaners are working even when there is no quarantine . Working means always paying attention , even when not much is going on around you . <p> But now there is an alarm ! <p> Robot detectors have picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do math very quickly . It can figure out the size of an object , and its speed , and where it 's headed , and even what it 's made of . <p> An Asp is headed toward Earth . <p> Antonio is ready . He is very brave . <p> He waits for the incoming Asp to come close to his first gun battery . If he fires at the Asp and misses , the Asp will change course . Then it will be even harder to hit . <p> Asps are like pieces of string . They can be kilometers long , but only a few meters thick . They are like giant worms . They are disgusting . <p> Sitting in his gunner 's seat , Antonio stares at his computer screen . He sees the Asp as a bright purple line . He tries to line up a red circle over the purple line . When the red circle is in the right place , Antonio can tell his guns to fire . The Asp moves quickly though , and it is hard to aim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Antonio wants to shoot it in a soft spot so it will break up into parts so tiny they 'll burn away as they fall to Earth . But if he shoots the Asp in the wrong place , in one of its hard joints , it will break up into several Asp segments and will be harder to kill . <p> The red circle is on the purple line . Antonio squeezes the trigger . A signal is sent to his guns and they fire . <p> Oh , no ! The Asp wriggles ! It is not a clean hit ! <p> Now there are four Asps . <p> Antonio 's job is harder now , but he does not give up . Being an astronaut means never giving up . He sends radio signals to his guns . He tries to line up four red circles over four purple lines . <p> Number one is lined up . Antonio fires . It 's a hit ! The Asp segment breaks up into many tiny bits . He does n't have to worry about them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mark ! <p> Number three is lined up . Antonio fires . It 's a bull's-eye ! <p> Now number four is lined up . But only for a second . The red circle drifts away from the purple line . Antonio tries to aim his guns again , but he ca n't move the red circle at all . He hears a voice inside his head . <p> We have descrambled your code , the voice says . We now control your guns . Thank you . <p> Asps know how to send signals to Earth . They know how to speak over our radios and televisions . They can interrupt our shows . Recently , they learned how to talk directly to people inside their heads . This kind of communication is called telepathy . Asps may have talked to you . What did they say ? <p> Asps want Earth to stop going into space . They want us to stop broadcasting radio and television . They want us to shut down our factories . They want us to stop drilling for oil . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop breeding animals . They want us to stop growing food on our farms . <p> When the Asps talk to you , it is very easy to want the same things they want . Some people have listened to them . They have started living the way the Asps want all of us to live . You may have heard your parents or teachers talking about " worms . " Worms look like normal people , but they are not normal . Worms are people who do what the Asps want . How can you tell who is a worm and who is normal ? Worms sometimes say strange things . They may say that machines are wrong or evil . They may complain about pollution . They may make their own clothes . <p> If you think someone is a worm , you should tell three grownups . You could tell your mother or father , and your teacher , and a police officer . <p> Remember , worms can be anybody . Worms look like normal people . <p> Even your parents could be worms . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asp is coming toward Earth . If it gets through , everything where it lands will die . It will kill all the people and all the plants and all the animals . <p> Antonio 's guns no longer work . The Asp has taken control of them . What can he do ? <p> Antonio has an idea . <p> The Asp speaks again : Your name is Antonio . Your favorite color is blue . Do n't use your machines . Be happy , Antonio . Be soft . Hello . <p> Antonio unstraps himself from the gunner 's seat and floats to the space station 's navigation controls . The space station has rocket engines that allow it to change its orbit . If it has to , it can even go to the Moon . <p> Metals are poison . Chemicals are poison . We will keep you warm , Antonio . We love you . Your favorite color is blue . Thank you . <p> Antonio wants to listen to the Asp . It has a nice voice . It is a little like his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's power . He believes the Asp will make him soft and warm . The Asp loves him . <p> Do n't be scratchy , Antonio . Call home . Tell them they can be alive and soft . We can make them alive and soft . Death is scratchy , Antonio . Hello . <p> Sometimes it is hard to do the right thing . <p> Antonio fires some of the space station 's engines . He switches them on and off to steer the station . The space station moves into the Asp 's path . <p> The Asp knows how to avoid beams from guns , but it does not know that the space station itself is a threat . <p> Through the window , Antonio watches the Asp come closer and closer . He thinks about his friends in the astronaut corps . He thinks about his mother and father back in the refugee camp . He would like to talk to them on the radio . He would like to be alive and soft with them . <p> The Asp is moving in fast . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a purple line , he tells himself . <p> It is just a purple line , and I am a red circle . <p> He puts his hands behind his back . <p> The Earth is so pretty from space . <p> Astronauts are the smartest and bravest people there are . There is nothing an astronaut wo n't do to help people . <p> Sometimes schools are named after astronauts who sacrifice their lives to protect our planet . <p> What is your school 's name ? <p> Will you be an astronaut ? <p> IMG
