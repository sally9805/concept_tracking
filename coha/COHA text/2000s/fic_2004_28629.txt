Chapter One Shai'tan AMME AND I sat in the backseat of the Fiat , covered entirely with black chadors . Only our eyes showed , both brown , pear-shaped , and frightened . In her irises I saw my own face reflected back at me , featureless , a dark , oval mass , the ghost or the devil she already believed me to be . We were driving into the inner parts of the Old City to visit the alim . Amme was convinced the devil was inside me and she wanted the mystic to exorcise it . But I knew that when she looked into my eyes , she saw the same thing , her own face dark and formless . My uncle sat in the front seat of the car in order to direct our driver , Ahmed . Amme did n't want anyone to know our destination , not even the driver . She worried word might reach Sameer , my fianc , and he would break the engagement if he heard I was possessed . So Abu Uncle guided the young driver through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their one- to two-room shacks as he searched For the alim 's house . The deeper we moved into the neighborhood , the fewer trees I saw . There were only cement walls here , one after the other , and alleys that led to more alleys , shooting off each other like veins , and I doubted we would find the alim . A few times we reached dead ends in the dirt road and had to backtrack . " He 'll take care of you , " Amme whispered to me through the glistening polyester of her veil . But she was careful to sit close to the door , careful not to touch me . " Do n't be worried . The dreams will stop . And the bleeding . You 'll be better . It 's not you , Layla , it 's not . " Her eyes searched me up and down as though she were looking for any signs of the devil . The more she behaved this way , the more I believed there really was something inside me . I stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond any of them . She glanced toward the front seat , at the slim and broad shoulders of Ahmed and Abu Uncle , then turned again to me . " The alim 's good , " she continued to whisper . " Not like the others . Your uncle says this one is authentic-he does n't take money . " Her eyes grew bigger and smaller as she spoke . " Do n't look at me like that , " she said . " Your eyes scare me . " She gazed out the window . Beneath her black veil , on her thigh , I saw the movement of her fist as she rolled her knuckles . Outside , the Old City streets were becoming narrower and narrower , and the cement houses smaller . In these parts , not even motor-rickshaws passed , so at the sound of our slow-moving car , bare-legged kids jumped out of doorways and chased after it , some waving sticks . We grew silent in their shrill laughter . A light rain was coming down , though here and there the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early July in India and the monsoons were just under way . Despite the rain , my uncle had his window open and his thick arm placed outside , the black hair becoming wet and pressed into his chocolate skin . His other arm was thrown across the length of the seat back , his fingers lingering near Ahmed 's thin shoulders . I watched the tips drum the vinyl car seat and waited to see if he would actually touch Ahmed . Men did that here , openly caressed one another , and no one was sure what those touches really meant , not even the men themselves ... or their brides-to-be . On the streets , men held hands and wrapped arms around waists while they walked . Having been raised in both India and America , for me these differences in cultures , slight as they sometimes might be , had caused much confusion . Each time I arrived in India or the U.S. , after spending a half year away , it was like turning a page and not knowing whether to begin reading the script from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . Yet the direction I chose always made a difference . " Here , here , " Abu Uncle said , squeezing Ahmed 's shoulder then pointing left toward an alleyway that looked like all the others . " Turn here . " By now Ahmed had turned on the wipers and they squeaked and scratched the windshield . He stopped the car and stuck his head out the window . " I ca n't go in there , sa'ab , " he said to Abu Uncle . " The car will get stuck . " " No , no , I think this will work . Go on , go on . " " I do n't think so , sa'ab . Look how narrow the alley is . Even if the car goes in , how will any of you be able to get out ? " He laughed . From behind , the hair of both was long and wavy , covering the sweaty napes of their necks . Amme and I leaned forward . It was early morning on a Friday , the holy day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them visible in their entirety . I studied the narrow passageway that lay between two rows of tiny houses , but could n't be certain if we would fit or not . The Fiat was smaller than the BMW I drove in Minneapolis , so I could n't trust my judgment . " Try to go in as far as you can , Ahmed , " Amme said . " Get us in closer . " " I do n't think it 'll go , " Ahmed said , turning to face her . " I know what can fit and what ca n't , Ahmed . Just go in farther . I wo n't be caught walking these streets . What will people say if they see us ? " " But memsa'ab ... " " Do it , " Abu Uncle ordered . Ahmed sighed and turned the car . The kids snickered and yelled , then smacked the trunk with open palms . The metal echoed . Ahmed mumbled that no one could recognize Amme and me with our chadors on , and we pretended not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assumed it had been built during the time of Nizam . Today , back alleys were nothing but dirt pathways . A sign of progress , indeed . The engine groaned but the car only inched forward as the kids pretended to push the Fiat from the sides and back . Ahmed drove us in about five feet then simply turned off the engine . The children 's sneers grew louder . On either side of us were white cement row houses , the roofs of corrugated sheet metal , the windows barred , the wooden shutters wide open to catch what air there might be back here . Every ten or so feet a different-colored door-blue , orange , pink , shades of yellow-each color representing a different house . " I 'll run the rest of the way and see if he 's in , " Abu Uncle offered . He had an angular face with thick eyebrows . Amme nodded . My uncle gave me a quick glance then tried on a smile . I stared at him , knowing he could n't see anything but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened the door , which hit against the wall of a house , and squeezed out . I watched his black-and-red checkered shirt disappear around a corner as he ran down the length of the curved passageway . " They call this Elephant Alley , " Ahmed said , turning toward us . His lips were dark from smoking . " It 's famous because not even an elephant could get through . It got stuck up there . " He pointed in the direction Abu Uncle had just gone down . " It took the men four hours to pull out the dumb animal . " " People here are always forcing things to happen , " I said , scrutinizing the whitewashed walls for any signs of skin or blood . There was none . " It 's only the show that counts . Poor animal . " " It happened because of a wedding , " Ahmed explained . " Everything here happens because of weddings , " I mumbled . The driver kept talking on , " The groom was riding the elephant to meet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding band was here , you see , and they were playing on their trumpets and banging on their drums as they led the groom . This way the bride and guests know the groom has arrived . You 'll see in just two days at your ... " " Ahmed , " I warned . I was n't in the mood to discuss my wedding . " You always talk too much . " " Sorry , Layla-bebe , " he said , smiling . I was sure he thought that I was behaving as a bride should , bashful , too mortified to talk about the upcoming event-for it meant the loss of virginity on the wedding night-and I let him think this . The children continued to pound on the trunk , the sound of the reverberating metal bringing women to their doorways and windows . They wore old cotton saris and one had a baby in her arms , its eyes lined black with kohl so the child would n't catch the evil eye . They stood just outside our car and watched us . Amme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother so hidden inside her veil that only half her eyes showed . " Cover up , " she snapped to me , but I ignored her . What more could I hide ? The car jiggled as the kids pushed against it . My stomach began to cramp at even this slight motion and I turned and gave the brats a nasty look . They did n't see me . So I imagined using my demonic powers . Maybe my eyes would turn red as I stared at them . Maybe I could fling them away without even a touch . But these were just images I had picked up in American horror movies . What did it mean , then , in real life , to be possessed ? Amme began whispering prayers for my salvation , her eyes closed , the veil 's fabric rippling against her lips , and I realized there was nothing she could now do to save me . " MAKE THE KIDS go away , " I told Ahmed . His dark cheeks were covered with pockmarks . He stuck his head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed back , then continued to shake the car . " Such disgusting children , " Amme said , her surahs finally completed . " These mothers have kids , then throw them to the streets . No discipline , no worry . Let whatever happens happen . Then they wonder why India is making no progress . Thoo ! " She spat out the window to show the women her contempt . Then she quickly covered her face . " Forget them , memsa'ab , " Ahmed said , trying to console her . " They are only alley kids . " " I do n't care about them , " she said . " I 'm worried about the car . " She leaned out and yelled at the kids . " Get away from the car , you bastard ! " They stopped moving at once . I turned and saw that three or four were actually sitting on the roof and sliding down the back window . Their skinny thighs were pressed flat against the glass . " Who 's going to pay for the damages ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use those sticks on you . " The children laughed . There must have been ten of them . By now , their nylon shirts had become drenched and their hair was flat on the crowns of their heads , making their ears stick out . " Zaheer , " one of the women called from her doorway . She rested her palms on the hood as she peered over the car at the children . " Do as the lady says and stop playing with the car . " There was silence , then the boy who must have been Zaheer ordered the others away . As the ones on the roof jumped off , the car bounced . Amme moved back inside and sat satisfied against the seat . " Ageeb log hai , " she said . " I have never seen such strange people . " " So listen , " Ahmed began again . " The groom was so eager to get married , he leapt off the rear of the elephant and ran to the mosque-without the band ! They were on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ahmed , stop your babbling , " Amme said . " You 're making me more angry . " " I 'm just telling a story . It 's to calm Layla-bebe . " " Layla-bebe does n't need calming . Why would you think that ? " " Of course she does n't , " he said and smiled . So , he already knew it all . Servants always did . You could n't keep any secrets from them . I glanced at Amme , but she had n't noticed his smile . She had grown even more restless and was turning this way and that , looking behind us , then in front . " When is he coming back ? " she asked . " You ca n't trust anyone with anything . He knows we ca n't be seen out here . And still he takes his time . " " No one can recognize you under the veil , " I said , trying to help . " Even I would n't be able to . " " Do n't be so naive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles once more turning on a thigh . She had been this way all morning , ever since I told her about my bleeding and suggested we cancel the wedding . " Someone might even recognize this car , " she went on . " Or Ahmed . Ahmed ! " She turned to him . " Stop looking around . Hide your face . " " Ar 're , memsa'ab , " he said , grinning . " No one will recognize me " " If you do n't stop arguing with me , Ahmed , I 'll throw you out and get another driver . You 're only one in a dozen . Do n't forget that . " His face grew solemn and he dropped low behind the steering wheel . I was glad she had shut him up . " And do n't you tell me you would n't know your own mother , " she said , turning her face away from me . " You have such a black tongue . So ungrateful-just like your father . Every day you grow more and more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sees it . Conveniently blind . Both of you , the same . " I , too , slid down in my seat and looked absently out the front window to the narrowing alley beyond . Though I had done everything I could not to be like my father-including agreeing to this marriage-I could no longer say that she was wrong . ABU UNCLE APPEARED around the corner , out of breath , and the women hid inside their houses so they would n't be seen by the unknown man . Just when they disappeared , the alley kids ran back to the car and began jumping on the trunk again . We shook inside . I held my stomach . It was round and hard . Abu Uncle leaned in through the passenger window . Ahmed sat up . " The alim is there , " my uncle said . " He 'll see us . " " How many other visitors does he have ? " Amme asked . " Only three people . He says he 'll seat us in the bedroom until they leave , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting time for his prayers . " " Let 's go then , " she said , turning to me . I breathed in as I stepped out of the car . The kids laughed and ran away . " Come on , come on . Quickly , " Abu Uncle said , waving to me . Amme was already racing through the alley , her head down . A black ghost against the white walls . I followed my uncle . We passed several open doors and windows , and from behind the curtains , I saw half faces , eyes , watching us pass . I was thankful for the chador and how invisible I became inside it . Behind us , Ahmed began yelling at the kids , while ahead , the alley curved , then led to the same monotony on the other side of the bend . Rows of concrete . The rain continued to fall . Hardly a breeze back here and only the stink of sharp urine and dull spices . The hem of my veil flapped against my ankles . Our sandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between rocks . One eye , half lips , stones . The rough heels of Abu Uncle 's sandaled feet . That was all I saw . I quickly lost my breath , then my foot caught and I slipped . I fell forward and a hot cramp pierced through my stomach . Abu Uncle grabbed my arm . His thumbnail jabbed into my flesh and I shrugged him away . " Sorry , " I said through the chador . I pressed my palm against my abdomen to soothe it , thankful that neither he nor Amme could see me doing this . " Careful , " he said . Continues ...
