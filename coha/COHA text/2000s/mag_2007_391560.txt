AMONG WALL STREET tribes , there has long been a group of swaggering deal specialists known as risk arbitrageurs , or risk arbs . Robert Rubin , the former Treasury Secretary now heading Citigroup , famously ran Goldman Sachs 's risk arb desk ; Ivan Boesky infamously made his name as Wall Street 's alpha arbitrageur . In the simplest form of arbitrage , these speculators pick up the spread between the current price and the agreed-to purchase price of a not-yet-consummated merger or acquisition . When deals close like clockwork , it 's about as close to a sure thing as Wall Street offers . Arbs know how much they stand to make and when they will be paid  --  it 's all in the merger announcement . ( Because they tend to deal in narrow spreads , arbs typically need to make their money fast . ) During the recent upheaval in the credit market , however , risk arbs had their mettle tested as high-profile deals like Harman International Industries and Acxiom were announced  --  then fell apart . But while the risk has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung in . And unlike in the ' ' 80s , firms today are diversified enough to escape ruin on arb deals alone . Consider Harrah 's , one case of merger interruptus . Last December when buyout firms TPG and Apollo said they would buy the casino giant for $90 a share , the stock was trading at $82 ; it rose to $85 by May . But when the credit markets seized in August , the deal looked as though it might fall apart ; at their nadir , shares traded below $80 . Many arbs who bailed took a hit . But some believed the financing would still come through and jumped in . They were richly rewarded when the stock recovered ( it now trades at close to $88 ) and appears likely to close at the agreed-upon $90 a share . " Opportunities like that do n't come along every day , " says Tom Burnett , a former risk arb specialist at Merrill Lynch and currently the executive vice president of research firm Wall Street Access . " All the spreads widened during the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many arbs saw major losses . Some deals , like GE 's proposed acquisition of mortgage company PHH Corp. , cratered quickly : PHH shares tumbled 15% in one day , too fast for many speculators to get out . Bad merger arbitrage bets so badly damaged British hedge fund De Putron Fund Management that UBS , a major investor , asked for its money back . Other deals fell apart slowly , and investors had time to get out . Havens Advisors sold Harman shares while rumors of a broken deal were churning but before shares tumbled . Several indexes that track risk arbitrage have held up : Total returns are about even with the S &P,; at 7% for the year . Still , the volatility may cause a shakeout among risk arb desks reminiscent of the one that followed the insider-trading scandals of the late ' ' 80s . Back then Boesky , Rubin , Richard Rosenthal at Salomon Brothers , and Guy Wyser-Pratte at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields were known as the " four horsemen " ; they so dominated the business that together they owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDermott Inc. bought it in 1977 But insider trading sullied arbitrage enough that most banks shut down their desks , and when a buyout of United Air Lines failed to close in 1989 , arbs saw devastating losses . Since then , arbitrage has risen from the ashes in the form of hedge funds that use the tactic and arb desks that are cogs in diversified investment firms . " A lot of people who do this do other things as well now , " says Varun Gosain , who runs Constellation Capital Management , a New York hedge fund . The risk is more insulated  --  but for arbs with nerves of steel , the rewards are still there . BOX Putting on the Risk Many deals looked as if they would n't survive the credit crunch , but arbs that hung in saw their payday . TXU Shares jumped to $67.93 when a buyout by Apollo and TPG was announced in February . They tumbled to $62 in August , but the deal ultimately paid out at the original offer price , $69.25 a share . FIRST DATA Shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share looked as if it would wither on the vine this summer . But the deal closed in September for the promised amount . HILTON Blackstone said in July it would buy the hotel group for $47.50 a share . Despite up-and-down trading through the summer , arbs were paid the deal price in October .
