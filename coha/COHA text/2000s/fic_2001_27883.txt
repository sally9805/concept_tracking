Hooking Up : What Life Was Like at the Turn of the Second Millennium : An American 's World By the year 2000 , the term " working class " had fallen into disuse in the United States , and " proletariat " was so obsolete it was known only to a few bitter old Marxist academics with wire hair sprouting out of their ears . The average electrician , air-conditioning mechanic , or burglar-alarm repairman lived a life that would have made the Sun King blink . He spent his vacations in Puerto Vallarta , Barbados , or St. Kitts . Before dinner he would be out on the terrace of some resort hotel with his third wife , wearing his Ricky Martin cane-cutter shirt open down to the sternum , the better to allow his gold chains to twinkle in his chest hairs . The two of them would have just ordered a round of Quibel sparkling water , from the state of West Virginia , because by 2000 the once-favored European sparkling waters Perrier and San Pellegrino seemed so tacky . European labels no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " intellectuals , " whom we will visit in a moment . Our typical mechanic or tradesman took it for granted that things European were second-rate . Aside from three German luxury automobilesthe Mercedes-Benz , the BMW , and the Audihe regarded European-manufactured goods as mediocre to shoddy . On his trips abroad , our electrician , like any American businessman , would go to superhuman lengths to avoid being treated in European hospitals , which struck him as little better than those in the Third World . He consideredEuropean hygiene so primitive that to receive an injection in a European clinic voluntarily was sheer madness . Indirectly , subconsciously , his views perhaps had to do with the fact that his own country , the United States , was now the mightiest power on earth , as onmipotent as Macedon under Alexander the Great , Rome under Julius Caesar , Mongolia under Genghis Khan , Turkey under Mohammed II , or Britain under Queen Victoria . His country was so powerful , it had begun to invade or rain missiles upon small nations in Europe , Africa , Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leaders were lording it over their subjects at home . Our air-conditioning mechanic had probably never heard of Saint-Simon , but he was fulfilling Saint-Simon 's and the other nineteenth-century utopian socialists ' dreams of a day when the ordinary workingman would have the political and personal freedom , the free time and the wherewithal to express himself in any way he saw fit and to unleash his full potential . Not only that , any ethnic or racial groupany , even recent refugees from a Latin countrycould take over the government of any American city , if they had the votes and a modicum of organization . Americans could boast of a freedom as well as a power unparalleled in the history of the world . Our typical burglar-alarm repairman did n't display one erg of chauvinistic swagger , however . He had been numbed by the aforementioned " intellectuals , " who had spent the preceding eighty years being indignant over what a " puritanical , " " repressive , " " bigoted , " " capitalistic , " and " fascist " nation America was beneath its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was too busy coping with what was known as the " sexual revolution . " If anything , " sexual revolution " was rather a prim term for the lurid carnival actually taking place in the mightiest country on earth in the year 2000 . Every magazine stand was a riot of bare flesh , rouged areolae , moistened crevices , and stiffened giblets : boys with girls , girls with girls , boys with boys , bare-breasted female bodybuilders , so-called boys with breasts , riding backseat behind steroid-gorged bodybuilding bikers , naked except for cache-sexes and Panzer helmets , on huge chromed Honda or Harley-Davidson motorcycles . But the magazines were nothing compared with what was offered on an invention of the 1990s , the Internet . By 2000 , an estimated 50 percent of all hits , or " log-ons , " were at Web sites purveying what was known as " adult material . " The word " pornography " had disappeared down the memory hole along with " proletariat . " Instances of marriage breaking up because of Web-sex addiction were rising in number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst would sit in front of the computer for twenty-four or more hours at stretch . Nothing that the wife could offer him in the way of sexual delights or food could compare with the one-handing he was doing day and night as he sat before the PC and logged on to such images as a girl with bare breasts and a black leather corset standing with one foot on the small of a naked boy 's back , brandishing a whip . In 1999 , the year before , this particular sexual kink sado-masochismhad achieved not merely respectability but high chic , and the word " perversion " had become as obsolete as " pornography " and " proletariat . " Fashion pages presented the black leather and rubber paraphernalia as style 's cutting edge . An actress named Rene Russo blithely recounted in the Living section of one of America 's biggest newspapers how she had consulted a former dominatrix named Eva Norvind , who maintained a dungeon replete with whips and chains and assorted baffling leather masks , chokers , and cuffs , in order to prepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Thomas Crown Affair , Miss Russo 's latest movie . " Sexy " was beginning to replace " chic " as the adjective indicating what was smart and up-to-the-minute . In the year 2000 , it was standard practice for the successful chief executive officer of a corporation to shuck his wife of two to three decades ' standing for the simple reason that her subcutaneous packing was deteriorating , her shoulders and upper back were thickening like a shot-putter'sin short , she was no longer sexy . Once he set up the old wife in a needlepoint shop where she could sell yarn to her friends , he was free to take on a new wife , a " trophy wife , " preferably a woman in her twenties , and preferably blond , as in an expression from that time , a " lemon tart . " What was the downside ? Was the new couple considered radioactive socially ? Did people talk sotto voce , behind the hand , when the tainted pair came by ? Not for a moment . All that happened was that everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up or E-mailed one another to find out the spelling of the new wife 's first name , because it was always some name like Serena and nobody was sure how to spell it . Once that was written down in the little red Scully &; Scully address book that was so popular among people of means , the lemon tart and her big CEO catch were invited to all the parties , as though nothing had happened . Meanwhile , sexual stimuli bombarded the young so incessantly and intensely they were inflamed with a randy itch long before reaching puberty . At puberty the dams , if any were left , burst . In the nineteenth century , entire shelves used to be filled with novels whose stories turned on the need for women , such as Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary , to remain chaste or to maintain a faade of chastity . In the year 2000 , a Tolstoy or a Flaubert would n't have stood a chance in the United States . From age thirteen , American girls were under pressure to maintain a faade of sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a term of contempt . The old term " dating " referring to a practice in which a boy asked a girl out for the evening and took her to the movies or dinnerwas now deader than " proletariat " or " pornography " or " perversion . " In junior high school , high school , and college , girls headed out in packs in the evening , and boys headed out in packs , hoping to meet each other fortuitously . If they met and some girl liked the looks of some boy , she would give him the nod , or he would give her the nod , and the two of them would retire to a halfway-private room and " hook up . " " Hooking up " was a term known in the year 2000 to almost every American child over the age of nine , but to only a relatively small percentage of their parents , who , even if they heard it , thought it was being used in the old sense of " meeting " someone . Among the children , hooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extent of what they did could vary widely . Back in the twentieth century , American girls had used baseball terminology . " First base " referred to embracing and kissing ; " second base " referred to groping and fondling and deep , or " French , " kissing , commonly known as " heavy petting " ; " third base " referred to fellatio , usually known in polite conversation by the ambiguous term " oral sex " ; and " home plate " meant conception-mode intercourse , known familiarly as " going all the way . " In the year 2000 , in the era of hooking up , " first base " meant deep kissing ( " tonsil hockey " ) , groping , and fondling ; " second base " meant oral sex ; " third base " meant going all the way ; and " home plate " meant learning each other 's names . Getting to home plate was relatively rare , however . The typical Filofax entry in the year 2000 by a girl who had hooked up the night before would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants : O , A , 6 .

" The letters referred to the sexual acts performed ( e.g. , TTC for " that thing with the cup " ) , and the Arabic number indicated the degree of satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 . In the year 2000 , girls used " score " as an active verb indicating sexual conquest , as in : " The whole thing was like very sketchy , but I scored that diesel who said he was gon na go home and caff up drink coffee in order to stay awake and study for the psych test . " In the twentieth century , only boys had used " score " in that fashion , as in : " I finally scored with Susan last night . " That girls were using such a locution points up one of the ironies of the relations between the sexes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sexual life easier , even insouciant , for men . Women had been persuaded that they should be just as active as men when it came to sexual advances . Men were only too happy to accede to the new order , since it absolved them of all sense of responsibility , let alone chivalry . Men began to adopt formerly feminine attitudes when the subject of marriage came up , pleading weakness and indecisiveness , as in : " I do n't know ; I 'm just not ready yet " or " Of course I love you , but like , you know , I start weirding out when I try to focus on it . " With the onset of puberty , males were able to get sexual enjoyment so easily , so casually , that junior high schools as far apart geographically and socially as the slums of the South Bronx and Washington 's posh suburbs of Arlington and Talbot County , Virginia , began reporting a new discipline problem . Thirteen- and fourteen-year-old girls were getting down on their knees and fellating boys in corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen-year-old in New York , asked by a teacher how she could do such a thing , replied : " It 's nasty , but I need to satisfy my man . " Nasty was an aesthetic rather than a moral or hygienic judgment . In the year 2000 , boys and girls did not consider fellatio to be a truely sexual act , any more than tonsil hockey . It was just " fooling around . " The President of the United States at the time used to have a twenty-two-year-old girl , an unpaid volunteer in the presidential palace , the White House , come around to his office for fellatio . He later testified under oath that he had never " had sex " with her . Older Americans tended to be shocked , but junior-high- school , high-school , and college students understood completely what he was saying and wondered what on earth all the fuss was about . The two of them had merely been on second base , hooking up . Teenage girls spoke about their sex lives to total strangers without the least embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man-on-the-street interviewer with the question : " How did you lose your virginity ? " Girls as well as boys responded without hesitation , posed for photographs , and divulged their name , age , and the neighborhood where they lived . Stains and stigmas of every kind were disappearing where sex was concerned . Early in the twentieth century the term " cohabitation " had referred to the forbidden practice of a man and woman living together before marriage . In the year 2000 , nobody under forty had ever heard of the word , since cohabitation was now the standard form of American courtship . For parents over forty , one of the thornier matters of etiquette concerned domestic bed assignments . When your son or daughter came home for the weekend with the live-in consort , did you put the two of them in the same bedroom , which would indicate implicit approval of the discomforting fail accompli ? Or did you put them in different bedrooms and lie awake , rigid with insomnia , fearful of hearing muffled footfalls in the hallway in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly old-fashioned thing to do ; and in the year 2000 , thanks to the feverish emphasis on sex and sexiness , nobody wanted to appear old , let alone old-fashioned . From the city of Baltimore came reports of grandmothers having their eyebrows , tongues , and lips pierced with gold rings in order to appear younger , since body-piercing was a popular fashion among boys and girls in their teens and early twenties . Expectant mothers were having their belly buttons pierced with gold rings so that the shapelessness of pregnancy would not make them feel old . An old man who had been prominent United States senator and a presidential candidate , emerged from what he confessed to have been a state of incapacity to go on television to urge other old men to take a drug called Viagra to free them from what he said was one of the scourges of modern times , the disease that dared not speak its name : impotence . He dared not speak it , either He called it " E.D. , " for erectile dysfunction . Insurance companies were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to pay for treatment . In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , old people in America had prayed , " Please , God , do n't let me look poor . " In the year 2000 , they prayed , " Please , God , do n't let me look old . " Sexiness was equated with youth , and youth ruled . The most widespread age-related disease was not senility but juvenility . The social ideal was to look twenty-three and dress thirteen . All over the country , old men and women were dressing casually at every opportunity , wearing jeans , luridly striped sneakers , shorts , T-shirts , polo shirts , jackets , and sweaters , heedless of how such clothes revealed every sad twist , bow , hump , and webbed-up vein clump of their superannuated bodies . For that matter , in the year 2000 , people throughout American society were inverting norms of dress that had persisted for centuries , if not millennia .

In 1999 , the Internet industry alone had produced fourteen new billionaires . The Valley 's mythology was full of the sagas of young men who had gone into business for themselves , created their own companies straight out of college , or , better still , had dropped out of college to launch their " start-ups , " as these new digital-age enterprises were known . Such were the new " Masters of the Universe , " a term coined in the eighties to describe the ( mere ) megamillionaires spawned by Wall Street during a boom in the bond business . By comparison with the Valley 's boy billionaires , the Wall Streeters , even though they were enjoying a boom in the stock market in the year 2000 , seemed slow and dreary .

The stodginess of such a career was symbolized by the stodginess of their dress . Even the youngest of them dressed like old men : the clark blah suit , the light blah shirt , the hopelessly " interesting " Herms tie ... Many of them even wore silk braces . The new Masters of the Universe turned all that upside down . At Il Fornaio restaurant in Palo Alto , California , where they gathered to tell war stories and hand out business cards at breakfast , the billionaire founders of the new wonder corporations walked in the door looking like well-pressed , well-barbered beachcombers , but beachcombers all the same . They wore khakis , boating moccasins ( without socks ) , and ordinary cotton shirts with the cuffs rolled up and the front unbuttoned to the navel , and that was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley billionaire carried no cell phone , Palm Pilot , HP-19B calculator , or RIM pagerhe had people who did that for him . Having breakfast with him at Il Fornaio would be a vice president whose net worth was $100 or $200 million . He would be dressed just like the founder , except that he would also be wearing a sport jacket . Why ? So that he could carry ... the cell phone , the Palm Pilot , the HP-19B calculator , and the RIM pager , which received E-mail and felt big as a brick . But why not an attach case ? Because that was what old-fashioned businessmen Back East carried . Nobody would be caught dead at Il Fornaio carrying an attach case . The Back East attach case was known scornfully as " the leather lunch pail . " When somebody walked into Il Fornaio wearing a suit and tie , he was likely to be mistaken for a matre d ' .
