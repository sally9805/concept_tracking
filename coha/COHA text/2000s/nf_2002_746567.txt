Section : ABA CONNECTION LAW PRACTICE Electronic Documents Are Vital to Building a Case , So Do n't Get Papered Over <p> AN INVESTIGATION INTO WALL Street 's business practices appears to reveal what one Merrill Lynch financial analyst reportedly thinks about impartiality . " The whole idea that we are independent from banking is a big lie . " <p> The probe by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is said to capture analysts privately admitting they sometimes were more interested in attracting banking fees than objectively analyzing businesses . Another analyst reportedly says a company being touted to the public as an investment vehicle is , in actuality , " a piece of junk . " <p> As with many damaging revelations produced in court during the past decade , these statements did not come from wiretaps  --  the old-fashioned way of gathering such information  --  but from e-mails produced in the normal course of discovery . <p> E-mails revealed Microsoft chairman Bill Gates ' unguarded opinion on Netscape . Kenneth Starr even recovered personal e-mails Monica Lewinsky deleted from her computer hard drive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . <p> But e-mail is only one of many kinds of electronic records that lawyers increasingly target when requesting , producing and sorting documents for litigation . Electronic documents are eligible for discovery wherever they may reside  --  whether in a corporate database , an individual 's cell phone contact list , or a computer hard drive . Thanks to advances in storage , archiving , imaging , scanning and search technology , all are readily accessible . <p> " It used to be you 'd send young associates out to Brooklyn to some vermin-infested , sweltering warehouse to wade through mountains of paper documents , " says Charles Weeden , chair of 17a-4 , a New York City-based company that archives electronic information . " Now , if you can put your data in a central database with a powerful enough search function , you can type in a keyword and get more information than that poor associate in Brooklyn ever could . " <p> According to a 2001 study from the University of California-Berkeley , 93 percent of all new information is created entirely in a digital format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted as including electronic data among the list of eligible documents . <p> That means discovery today ought to be almost entirely an electronic affair . However , courts still struggle with how to handle discovery of these kinds of digital records . One reason is that there is little case law to draw upon . Judges often venture into uncharted territory when they take on electronic discovery disputes . <p> " Discovery battles are very rarely reported , " says Denver intellectual property attorney Natalie Hanlon-Leh . " I ca n't say to the judge , ' Here 's how other judges handled this same problem before , ' because there 's simply no record there . " <p> The consequence , specialists warn , is that electronic discovery can become combative . " This is electronic warfare , " says Bill Speros , a Cleveland attorney and independent e-discovery consultant . " It 's going to be contentious because the courts really have n't given us any guidance  --  nothing about what to retain or what limits there are on what to produce . I have never seen an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only beginning to define the scope of the e-discovery process . Although Rule 34 says electronic documents are discoverable if relevant , and Rule 26 sets some scope and limits to the process , discovery of electronic records is more complicated than the rules account for . It is often up to individual courts to decide exactly how electronic evidence ought to be handled , presented or transferred , or if there are limits to what is discoverable . <p> For this reason alone , lawyers say , the first rule of electronic discovery is to negotiate with the other side . " That 's the only way to limit costs and define the scope of what needs to be produced , " says Tyra Wright , an attorney with Ford Motors in Detroit . " It seems obvious , but if you do n't sit down and figure these things out , it 's easy for things to get out of control . " <p> A successful negotiation can produce a data exchange agreement , which lays out timelines and defines details such as what format documents ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward request for an archive of a company 's e-mails could become a confused mess . That 's because such a simple request could involve vast amounts of potentially discoverable data stored in multiple locations across the globe . <p> Sometimes the parties will have to get the court 's help . Hanlon-Leh says the responding party can attempt to limit the scope of discovery through objections and motions to the judge to set guidelines . She also recommends that lawyers negotiate and define the search terms to be used in scouring a database for documents . This can limit the scope of production , so long as both parties agree on relevant search terms and on how to protect privileged information . <p> Negotiating is especially necessary because many courts have been trying to speed along the discovery process , which means there is little time to recover from mistakes . And the more quickly the courts move , the more costs multiply , says Milwaukee litigation partner William Mulligan . " When you 're doing a massive transfer of documents in a short time , it takes a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trade secrets and to maintain a chain of custody of the documents . " PICKING UP THE TAB <p> ONE ISSUE THE COURTS HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH IS how to allocate the costs for electronic discovery . In the world of paper discovery , courts typically have ruled that the producing party bears the financial burden of production . But in e-discovery proceedings , the matter of cost is often unsettled . <p> In one recent case , Rowe Entertainment v. William Morris Agency , 205 F.R.D. 421 ( S.D.N.Y. 2002 ) , the court came up with an eight-point test to see which parties ought to shoulder the burden . In the Jan. 16 ruling , a federal magistrate concluded plaintiffs should pay for producing defendants ' e-mail , and defendants should pay for reviewing the data for privileged or confidential information . Among the factors the court weighed were the cost of producing electronic files , the likelihood of discovering critical information , and the resources available to each party . <p> The court noted that both the plaintiffs and defendants , all major players in the concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But two other factors helped tip the balance in favor of plaintiffs bearing the costs of production : The costs of recovering the e-mail would be substantial and the material was not likely to be a " gold mine " of information . <p> This kind of test offers a model for other courts to use in mediating electronic discovery disputes . But allocation of costs is n't the only dispute likely to arise , especially when the price tag is hefty . HARDBALL TACTICS <p> COSTS CAN ESCALATE WHEN PRETRIAL SKIRMISHING OVER electronic discovery turns hardball . Lawyers need to beware of traps for the unschooled  --  especially when it involves how e-data is produced . <p> " One thing I do is advise my clients to print out electronic evidence and turn it over in paper form . It 's counterintuitive and more expensive , but I 'm a mercenary , and I want to drive up the costs and make things difficult for the other side , " says Speros . " If adversaries are not sophisticated enough to ask for electronic documents , you might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . " <p> The courts have begun to address this kind of tactic , though . A recent example involved plaintiffs in a pharmaceutical class action who were asked to pay for photocopies of millions of pages of defendants ' documents that were also available in electronic form . Plaintiffs had agreed to pay 10 cents a page , but balked when they got the bill . That 's when defendants disclosed the fact that many of the documents were printed at the same time they were scanned into a database . Defendants offered to make the documents available in digital form  --  if plaintiffs split the cost and paid more than $200,000 . <p> The ruling in In re Bristol Myers Squibb Securities Litigation , 205 F.R.D. 437 ( D.N.J. 2002 ) , forced Bristol Myers Squibb to produce the electronic records and obligated it to help defray some of the plaintiffs ' expenses . <p> The court said the defendants should have disclosed at the start of the litigation that some documents were available in electronic form , and there would be no charge for photocopies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintiffs of the plan to scan additional documents  --  absent an expressed request for the information  --  that did n't let defendants off the hook . <p> Plaintiffs had already paid for the printed documents , so they need only pay nominal costs for an electronic copy , the court said . " Any other decision would result in the plaintiffs paying for ' double discovery , ' " the court said . <p> In addition , some courts have shown little patience for litigants who complain that technology limits their ability to produce documents in electronic form . During the discovery phase of Sattar v. Motorola , 138 F.3d 1164 ( 7th Cir. 1997 ) , the plaintiffs requested hard copies of more than 200,000 e-mails because they could n't read the defendant 's electronic files . The court ruled that the defendant must equip the plaintiff with the capacity to read the files , or pay for half of the hard-copy costs . FINDING WHAT YOU NEED <p> IN DISCOVERING WHAT COMPUTER DATA AND HARDWARE their opponents possess , lawyers find it useful to get past the corporate suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually does n't know much , but if you go after the computer geeks , you 'll find all sorts of things management would probably tell you were n't possible , " says Hanlon-Leh . " Not because of belligerence , but just simple ignorance of what their technology can do . " <p> Information technology experts can tell what data is backed up or saved regularly , where it might be stored , what format it exists in , and what part of it might be recoverable . These kinds of details are usually outside the purview of management . <p> Probably the most important role technical experts play is simply figuring out where relevant documents are likely to be stored . The volume of data that computer networks are capable of storing grows exponentially every year . " Storage capacity is becoming such that you could be dealing with an impossible amount of data , " says Ford 's Wright . " When you 're dealing with file drawers , it 's relatively easy to identify and locate things , but electronic data is another story . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discovery is huge . A typical computer hard drive holds at least a couple of gigabytes of information , with each gigabyte roughly equal to 75,000 printed pages . A typical e-discovery procedure might turn up hundreds of CD-ROMs of material , each with 600 MB of data , or the equivalent of 30,000 to 40,000 printed pages . <p> And lawyers also need to be aware that there is more to be concerned with than just a document 's contents . For example , within every computer file there is metadata , or information about the file itself , such as when it was created , who created it , when it was last modified . <p> Metadata , invisible to the user , is embedded in a document 's source code but is often as important as an actual document because it establishes potentially important details about who accessed or modified a document and when  --  items that few paper documents reveal . <p> The upshot is that lawyers need to have a battle plan going into the e-discovery process , one that would search and catalog electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn over . <p> An electronic discovery plan should include special codes for privileged , proprietary and highly sensitive materials . Organized codification makes it possible to avoid keeping multiple copies of a document or neglecting to obtain an important record . <p> " The first thing I do is come up with a plan to make sure I do n't do something stupid . So many times an associate will hand me a disk and say to me , ' Here 's that document , ' or , ' I 'll e-mail it to you , ' " says Hanlon-Leh . " We 've gotten so used to handling information this way in our work , but to handle evidence like that is a mistake . " <p> The standard method of organization is to place discoverable documents into one single format , usually TIFF or PDE which is easily searched and allows scans of paper to be stored electronically . However , lawyers can not always scan paper and turn it into electronic formats , so they often have to manage discovery of paper records separately . BLASTS FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROFIcient e-discovery expert are dealing with outdated or proprietary data formats . " We were handed backup tapes from one client from 10 years ago on an arcane , old e-mail system called CA Mail , " says Dave Barnes , marketing manager for Minneapolis-based Quorum , an e-discovery outsourcing company . " We called Computer Associates , the company that made the system , and they did n't even know they 'd made such a product . I 'm not sure if we 'll ever get that data . " <p> Lawyers with e-discovery experience agree that outside consultants can be vital to complicated electronic request battles but warn not to rely on them entirely . Consultants can assess the infrastructure and technologies involved in a case , deflect meritless requests , perform forensic analysis on recovered data and provide other technical help . And outsourcing companies may offer a cost-effective way to manage a high volume of data . These companies have the hardware , technical experience and process in place for e-discovery . <p> But lawyers need to be involved in setting search criteria , screening for privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on experts can lead to problems . " Third-party experts are important , " says Guadalupe Sisneros , vice chair of the ABA Computer and Internet Litigation Committee . " But if you give them too much power , it 's easy to lose control . Experts can wind up making the process very expensive , " Sisneros says . <p> " Experts can do things like the forensic analysis and help develop your response plans , " adds Hanlon-Leh . " But do n't presume experts know everything ; you 've got to think about the process . " <p> No matter how daunting it may appear , the process should be familiar to those accustomed to discovery in a paper world . " A lot of the literature will say , ' Oh , this is all new , all different , ' and discuss ways to adapt to this new world , " says Hanlon-Leh . " But courts do n't like ' different . ' The courts want to ensure that the same rules that worked for the paper world will apply to electronic . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to begin thinking about it after electronic records become an issue in litigation . Electronic discovery specialists recommend that any large organization should have policies in place for a day when it may be required to produce electronic documents . <p> While companies may treat electronic data differently than paper , the duty to preserve documents is the same for both . That can become a problem : Electronic files are continually being erased or overwritten as a normal part of business . A number of defendants have been sanctioned or otherwise rebuked in court for recycling backup tapes of information , something most corporations do every day . <p> A document retention policy , which outlines what documents should be kept and what should be thrown away or destroyed , is especially important because courts have ruled that litigants can request even deleted documents and fragments Of documents . In Simon Property Group v. mySimon , 194 F.R.D. 639 ( S.D. Ind . 2000 ) , the court stated , " Computer records , including records that have been ' deleted , ' are documents discoverable under Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOO ? <p> THE DUTY TO PRESERVE DOES NOT STOP WITH ELECTRONic documents themselves . Hanlon-Leh says she was recently involved in litigation that concerned a years-old sales presentation on a salesperson 's laptop . Unfortunately , the salesperson no longer had the computer . <p> " When did we have a duty to save all the salespeople 's laptops ? " says Hanlon-Leh . " As soon as someone complained about the product ? When we receive a demand letter ? When you go to trash an old laptop ? The rules are pretty vague . " <p> In one recent case , a court held that a defendant 's hard drive was discoverable because it was likely that it held relevant information , so long as its production would not be unduly burdensome . Playboy Enterprises v. Welles , 60 F. Supp. 2d 1050 ( S.D. Cal . 1999 ) . The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco later affirmed and reserved in part on another issue at 279 F.3d 796 ( 2002 ) . <p> But while it is possible to recover deleted files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Speros . " It is a fiction in the market that you can recover deleted data , " he says . " You can usually get crumbs , and sometimes whole documents , but if someone really wants to , they can make sure data is ... permanently gone . " <p> Lawyers say that courts are beginning to recognize that allowing unlimited requests for electronic records would quickly become burdensome on a company 's information technology department and inhibit its ability to do business . The only way to avoid getting sucked into a costly fight over electronic records is to catalog them for easy retrieval and to have a regular , coherent policy for destroying documents . Offering detailed records to the court will help avoid charges of spoliation  --  the destruction of discoverable documents  --  and give the court an accurate picture of what is discoverable . <p> That may be a challenge to large companies , which seem constantly involved in litigation of one kind or another . " We 've always had a document retention policy ; Ford would n't be able to operate without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document retention policy ought not to be burdensome to daily operations but should offer easy-to-follow guidelines . An effective policy is designed to identify and preserve necessary business documents and to retrieve electronic records for litigation , while keeping them to a minimum . Such a policy is especially important for e-mail because it can be costly for businesses to produce the huge volume typically generated . <p> Beyond keeping detailed records , companies need to have a plan in place for the retrieval and preservation of documents after a demand letter is served . " The first thing you have to do is to find and preserve any e-mail and record stores you can think of . Even those kept by third parties  --  they must be frozen , " says Wright . " When you get a preservation demand letter you have to put everyone on notice . Tell them you simply can not destroy things . " <p> But as the recent government prosecution of embattled accounting firm Arthur Andersen for obstruction of justice shows , even a document retention plan is not always protection against charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Duncan claimed in court that he thought he was working within Andersen 's document retention policy when he ordered Enron-related documents shredded . " The first barrage of demand letters in any discovery process will ruin even the best document retention policy , " says Speros . <p> Of all the ways to prepare for e-discovery battles , perhaps the best is simply to understand technology . Because developments in computer science typically move much faster than the courts , lawyers who understand technology and electronic records can often dictate and control the discovery process . " E-discovery is the most significant challenge we have to the rules of evidence , " says Speros . " Unless you 're aggressive and know how to handle it , you Will get beaten up .
