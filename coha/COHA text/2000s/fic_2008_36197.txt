The Beggar at the Corner <p> I 'm a man of a certain age  --  old enough to have been every kind of fool  --  and I find to my surprise that the only counsel I have to pass on is this : Never let your name be found in a dead man 's trousers . <p> Name , yes . Mine is Hector Carpentier . These days , Professor Carpentier , of the +cole de MTdecine . My specialty is venereology , which is a reliable source of amusement for my students . " Come with us , " they say . " Carpentier 's going to tell all about the second stage of syphilis . You 'll never screw again . " <p> I live on the Rue du Helder , with an orange tabby named Baptiste . My parents are dead , I have no brother or sister and have n't yet been blessed with children . In short , I 'm the only family I 've got , and at certain intervals of calm , my mind drifts toward those people , not strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of family  --  for a time , anyway . If you were to pin me down , for instance , I 'd have to say I recall the lads I went to medical school with better than I recall my own father . And Mother . . . well , she 's present enough after all these years , but from some angles , she 's not quite as real as Charles . Who was perhaps not real at all but who was , for a time , like family . <p> I think about him every time I see a penta . One glance is all it takes , and I 'm standing once more in the Luxembourg Gardens , somewhere in May . I 'm watching a pretty girl pass ( the angle of her parasol , yes , the butter brightness of her gloves ) , and Charles is brooding over flowers . He is always brooding over flowers . This time , though , he actually plucks one and holds it up to me : an Egyptian star cluster . <p> Five arms , hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starfish dragged from the ocean bottom and . . . never mind , I ca n't do it justice . And , really , it 's not so remarkable , but sitting there in the cup of his hand , it lays some claim on me , and so does everything else : the Scottish terrier snoring on a bench ; the swan cleaning its rump feathers in the fountain ; the moss-blackened statue of Leonidas . I am the measure of those things and they of me , and we are all  --  sufficient , I suppose . <p> Of course , nothing about our situation has shifted . We are still marked men , he and I. But at this moment , I can imagine a sliver of grace  --  the possibility , I mean , that we might be marked for other things . And all because of this silly flower , which on any other day , I would have stepped on like so much carpet . <p> He 's been on my mind of late , because just last week , I received a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coronini 's estate in Slovenia . ) The envelope was girt round with stamps , and the letter , written in her usual shy hand , was mostly an essay on rain , sealed off by prayers . I found it comforting . Word has it that the Duchess is penning her memoirs , but I do n't believe it . No woman has clutched her own life more closely to her bosom . She 'll hold it there , I expect , until the coroner assures her she 's dead . <p> Which may be a long time coming . God 's funny that way . The more his servants pine for his presence  --  and make no mistake , the Duchess does  --  the longer he keeps them shackled to the old mortal coil . No , it 's the blasphemers he 's aching to get his hands on . Take Monsieur Robespierre . At the very height of the Terror , Robespierre decided that the name " God " had too much of an ancien rTgime color to it . In his capacity as head of the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as the Supreme Being . There was some kind of festival , I believe , to celebrate God 's promotion . A parade , maybe . I was only two . <p> A few months later , with half his jaw shot off , groaning toward the scaffold , was Robespierre already composing apologies ? We 'll never know . There was no time for memoirs . <p> Me , I have acres of time , but if I were to write up my life , I do n't think I could start with the usual genuflections  --  all those ancestors in halberds , I mean , the midwives catching you in their calloused mitts . No , I 'd have to start with Vidocq . And maybe end with him , too . <p> A strange admission , I know , given that I spent no more than a few weeks in his company . Fifteen years have passed with virtually no word from him . Why , then , should I bother revisiting the terrible business that brought us together ? <p> Not from any hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may believe . Did it really happen ? In quite that way ? Nothing to do but set everything down , as exactly as I can , and see what stares back at me . <p> And how easily the time slips away , after all . I need but shut my eyes , and two decades vanish in a breath , and I am standing once more in . . . <p> The year 1818 . Which , according to official records , is the twenty-third year in the reign of King Louis XVIII . For all but three of those years , however , his majesty has been reigning somewhere else entirely  --  hiding , an unkind soul might say , while a certain Corsican made a footstool of Europe . None of that matters now . The Corsican has been locked away ( again ) ; the Bourbons are back ; the fighting is done ; the future is cloudless . <p> This curious interregnum in French history goes by the name of " the Restoration , " the implication being that , after senseless experiments with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their senses and have invited the Bourbons back to the Tuileries . The old unpleasantness is never alluded to . We have all seen enough politics to last us a lifetime , and we know now : to take a hard line is to take a hard fall . <p> <br> Continues ...
