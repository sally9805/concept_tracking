Section : TRANSITION 2000 They helped shape the 20th century  --  and caught a glimpse of the 21st . A gallery of faces to remember TABLE <p> The showbiz Leonardo da Vinci , Allen composed thousands of songs ( including " This Could Be the Start of Something Big " ) , played Benny Goodman on film , wrote books and campaigned against sex and violence on TV . But his biggest legacy  --  as the first host of " The Tonight Show "  --  is America 's habit of staying up late to watch funnymen sit behind desks and trade cracks with movie stars . TABLE <p> " My mother says I began rhyming at seven , " Gwendolyn Brooks wrote in her autobiography . " Of course I would be a poet ! " But it always bemused Brooks that she was better known for being the first African-American writer to win a Pulitzer Prize ( in 1950 ) than for the poems themselves  --  except perhaps for the much-anthologized 1960 lyric " We Real Cool , " which ends : " We/Jazz June . We/Die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy Marchand . As the widowed Los Angeles Tribune publisher on the late- ' 70s TV drama " Lou Grant , " Marchand captured four Emmy Awards in five seasons . Then , in 1998 , she electrified HBO as Mafia mom Livia Soprano , the Machiavelli in the oxygen mask . No Emmys this time  --  just an instant niche in the pantheon of TV villainy . TABLE <p> The so-called Lion of Damascus took power in Syria in 1970 , during a so-called bloodless coup . The Syrian strongman held on until his death through several attempts to overthrow him ; in 1982 his security forces killed some 10,000 people during an uprising . Despite recent peace talks , he never succeeded in getting back the Golan Heights , which Syria lost to Israel during the 1967 war , when he was Defense minister . TABLE <p> Comic-book artist Gil Kane 's bursting , gestural reimaginings of classic superheroes , such as Captain Marvel , Green Lantern and Spider-Man , jump-started a moribund industry in the 1960s . His life in comics began at 16 with a job at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses D.C. and Marvel . In 1990 his career peaked again with a comic-book adaptation of Wagner 's " Ring " cycle . TABLE <p> In the years before R-rated skin invaded the cineplex , the Austrian-born " World 's Most Beautiful Woman " was our topless goddess . Lamarr parlayed a short nude scene in the 1932 Czech film " Ecstasy " into a long career in America . But the actress was no brainless beauty : during World War II she invented a device that prevented the jamming of radio-controlled weapons . TABLE <p> He called himself a " cultural journalist "  --  choosing both words advisedly . As editor of NEWSWEEK 's arts coverage in the ' 60s and ' 70s , and theater and film critic from 1975 , Jack Kroll investigated both high culture and pop culture with the same erudition , energy and enthusiasm . He could build an unanswerable case for the lasting importance of Harold Pinter , of Sharon Stone , of Radio City Music Hall  --  which his advocacy helped save from demolition  --  or of his getting more space for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabin , in 1943 , 15-year-old Leah Schlossberg thought he looked like King David . And as Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote in NEWSWEEK this year , what mattered most to Leah Rabin was being " a soldier 's wife , a general 's wife , a prime minister 's wife , " who , even in the years after her husband 's assassination by a Jewish extremist in 1995 , continued to believe in and speak out for his dream of " a secure Israel at peace with her neighbors . " TABLE <p> " U is for Una who slipped down a drain/V is for Victor squashed under a train . " Artist Edward Gorey 's eccentric imaginative world , Edmund Wilson once wrote , is both " poetic and poisoned . " In his delicate and pitiless illustrated books , scrawny children and hollow-eyed adults die horribly or simply wilt away in Victorian manses , and for some reason  --  our own dread seeking relief ?  --  we find it all irresistibly funny . TABLE <p> Before she turned to television in 1953 , actress Loretta Young lent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from silent films to talkies . Famous for her practice of fining actors who cursed on the set of her films , she refused to say the word " divorce " on screen  --  even though she was twice divorced herself . Consistency may not have been Young 's strong suit , but being a star came easy . TABLE <p> It was only fitting that Willie B. , Zoo Atlanta 's famous lowland gorilla , should be named after a human ( former Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield ) . He often seemed as human as the millions who came to see him over 39 years . To wit : the 400-pound primate was slapped in his first encounter with a female in 1989 . He learned his lesson and produced five children , including his only son , Willie B. Jr . TABLE <p> " My heroines are always virgins , " Dame Barbara Cartland , queen of the romance novel , once said . " They never go to bed without a ring on their fingers . " Her chaste protagonists  --  723 of them  --  sprang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often Cartland would complete two novels a month . In all , they 've sold 1 billion copies . TABLE <p> " If you buy my lamp , " its nudist British inventor claimed , " you wo n't need drugs . " Yeah , right . But if you owned a Lava lamp  --  Edward Craven Walker 's 1963 oil-and-water gizmo inspired by an egg timer  --  you still needed a tie-dyed parachute on the ceiling , " In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida " on the hi-fi and a headband of beer-can tabs to go with it . In the 1990s , a new generation of teens made Walker 's bubbling brainchild hip again , as if to prove what he once said : " It grows , breaks up , falls down and then starts all over again . " TABLE <p> The silken-voiced Sir John Gielgud was both the last of England 's great classical actors and a pioneer of modern theater . While moviegoers knew him mostly as the foulmouthed butler in the 1981 comedy " Arthur , " his 1934 " Hamlet "  --  never filmed  --  was his defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing lyrical or old-fashioned about him , " Ralph Fiennes recalled . " He was so courageous , direct and ruthless . " TABLE <p> " Beloved " is an overused word . But with " Peanuts " cartoonist Schulz , it 's not only absolutely necessary but it applies to the whole America-in-a-snow-globe cast of his gently philosophical strip ( which ran almost 50 years ) : Charlie Brown , Lucy , Snoopy , Linus , Franklin , Schroeder , Pig Pen , The Little Red-Haired Girl and the rest . " Peanuts " paraphernalia sold more than $1 billion worth annually . And you know what ? Schulz deserved it . TABLE <p> If only we had listened . Karski was a clandestine representative of the Polish government-in-exile when he had himself smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto , and then into an actual Nazi concentration camp . He told both Anthony Eden and Franklin Roosevelt what was happening to the Jews of Europe , but could prod neither to decisive action . Karski 's revelatory book , " Story of a Secret State , " was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trudeau veered between JFK-ish swingin ' statesman and Jerry Brown-like flake , doing yoga and posing with a rose between his teeth . But as Canada 's Liberal prime minister from 1968 to 1984  --  with a brief hiatus as opposition leader  --  he quelled separatists in both Quebec and western Canada , helping forge a truly bicultural nation . TABLE <p> Long before those famous jowls dragged his face into the visage of an adorable sourpuss , Walter Matthau was a surprisingly versatile leading man , ranging with ease from hard-eyed villain in the Cary Grant classic " Charade " to seductive romantic alongside Glenda Jackson in " House Calls . " But in our mind 's eye , he 'll always be a curmudgeon . His dour , sardonic turns opposite Jack Lemmon  --  both early ( " The Odd Couple " ) and late ( " Grumpy Old Men " )  --  play like comic master classes . TABLE <p> Patrolling the sidelines of a football field like a gray-suited Patton , Tom Landry was the commander in chief of America 's Team for 29 years . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games ( third-most in NFL history ) , 13 division titles and two Super Bowls  --  all without ever disturbing his trademark fedora . TABLE <p> Not everybody thought the POW-camp sitcom " Hogan 's Heroes " was all that funny , and not everybody thought the fatuous , bumbling commandant Col. Klink  --  the character Klemperer played on it  --  would have indeed been the same " total bureaucrat ... if he had worked for General Motors . " But that 's how the son of conductor Otto Klemperer ( who fled Hitler in the 1930s ) saw it . And from 1965 to ' 71 , most of America was also willing to sacrifice political good taste to laughter . TABLE <p> Long , long before there was Ricky Martin and all that blonda Latin music , Tito Puente combined jazz , big bands and an Afro-Caribbean beat into what became known as " salsa " music . ( Puente  --  dubbed " the Salsa King "  --  disliked the term . ) He said he wanted to live long enough to have the first Latin band to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's up there now , playing timbales in the stars . TABLE <p> Nothing in socially conscious American art comes close to the stark , brightly colored paintings that make up Lawrence 's landmark series " The Migration of the Negro " ( 1941 ) . The work chronicled the vast , between-the-wars northward movement of Southern blacks in search of a better life . Lawrence learned to paint at the Harlem Art Workshop and often walked miles to the Metropolitan Museum to look at Renaissance painting . TABLE <p> To correct her illness-ravaged legs Gwen Verdon spent much of her childhood in orthopedic boots  --  and boy did they work . The effervescent redhead danced to Broadway stardom in " Can-Can " and , as Lola , the Devil 's seductive sidekick , in 1955 's " Damn Yankees . " The latter role , her first choreographed by future husband Bob Fosse , won her the second of four Tony Awards . TABLE <p> In the 1976 presidential election , Gus Hall collected just 58,992 votes  --  his best showing in four ill-fated campaigns . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lifelong true believer , undeterred by the Soviet collapse of 1991 or his ever-dwindling constituency , Hall spent eight years in prison for his beliefs and 41 more as general secretary of the American Communist Party . TABLE <p> The leader of the country 's biggest and most powerful diocese ( including most of New York City ) was an unapologetic moral conservative : he disapproved of abortion , homosexuality and the ordination of women . But he labored mightily to avoid the stridency from the pulpit that often accompanied such a stance , and also maintained one of the church 's more liberal constants  --  care for immigrants and the poor . TABLE <p> While teaching law in Africa as a young man , Ruff contracted a virus  --  never identified  --  that forced him to work the rest of his life from a wheelchair . By 1997 , however , he was White House counsel and went on to represent President Clinton in the impeachment hearings . Ruff conceded his client had committed deplorable deeds ( many in concert with a youthful intern ) . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal conduct was n't sufficient ground for tossing out a sitting commander in chief . TABLE <p> As a 24-year-old security guard at Washington 's Watergate building in 1972 , Frank Wills found tape over a lock on a basement door and called the cops . Five intruders were arrested in the office of the Democratic National Committee  --  and , to make a very long story very short , President Nixon resigned two years later . In recent years Wills was unemployed ; he died of a brain tumor at 52 . TABLE <p> Before his career as a columnist and a TV pundit , Rowan was a pioneer . In the 1950s he was the only black reporter to cover the Montgomery , Ala. , bus boycott for a national paper ; in the mid- ' 60s , as head of the U.S. Information Agency , he was the highest-ranking black in government . His independent-minded columns attacked the usual suspects  --  Reagan , J. Edgar Hoover  --  but also MLK , Jr. , for his antiwar activities . TABLE <p> In 1990 British novelist O'Brian 's manly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy to figure why : in an age of chocolate-popper 's trash like " Scruples , " who would want to read about early-1800s British naval warfare ? Then Norton began putting out the books  --  " the finest historical novels ever written " said one critic  --  and found millions of readers ready to set sail . TABLE <p> " It 's only a thimbleful of a voice , " Julie London once admitted , " and I have to use it close to a microphone . But it is a kind of oversmoked voice , and it automatically sounds intimate . " Her second husband , songwriter Bobby ( " Route 66 " ) Troup , encouraged the sultry actress to take up singing , and she achieved mass intimacy in 1955 , selling 3 million copies of her single , " Cry Me a River . " TABLE <p> It seems downright perverse that Guinness , who was a titan of the British stage , should be best remembered by many moviegoers for uttering such a hokey , faux-mystical line as " Use the force , Luke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with its soul-shaking gravitas  --  that made it fly in the first place . In both pop sci-fi fare like " Star Wars " and in artful jewels like " Kind Hearts and Coronets , " Guinness 's effortless poise made a silver screen glow . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Simply red : With Damn Yankees , ' Verdon won her second Tony Award <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> Written by David Gates ; Devin Gordon and Peter Plagens <p>
