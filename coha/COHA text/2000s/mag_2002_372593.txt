U.S. forces are seeking to undertake another raid inside Pakistan , sources in Islamabad tell TIME , like the one that captured Osama bin Laden 's lieutenant , Abu Zubaydah , two weeks ago . This time , however , they are after bigger quarry : bin Laden himself . Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca , the sources say , was in Islamabad last month to ask Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for permission to make the raid on Pakistan 's mountainous border with Afghanistan . But Musharraf has still not given his consent . He is hesitant , the sources say , because the fierce tribes of the region are well armed and sympathetic to Afghanistan 's former Taliban regime . An American military operation , especially if it went wrong , could weaken the Pakistani leader 's already frayed ties to the area . <P> After three months in which the hunt for bin Laden has looked nearly hopeless , U.S. authorities now seem convinced that their top terror suspect is hiding in the lawless borderland territory . That conviction may have been bolstered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lair in central Pakistan . If intelligence from the Abu Zubaydah raid has added to the U.S. evidence that bin Laden is hiding in the borderlands , Musharraf 's decision may get tougher yet .  --  By Tim McGirk
