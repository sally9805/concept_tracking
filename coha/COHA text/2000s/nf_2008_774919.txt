Introduction // Female Puppets and Eunuchs // Why ca n't a woman be more like a man ? // The question seemed innocent enough in 1964 . As sung by Henry Higgins , the lovesick Victorian professor in My Fair Lady , social class was changeable  --  just a matter of tweaking accent and costume  --  but the gender divide was completely inscrutable . Four decades later the question is still being asked , but with a different twist . Now it usually means " Should n't a woman be more like a man ? " The frustration is still there , now torqued with unfulfilled expectations . // Like Higgins , most of us do n't realize that we think of male as the standard , and of female as a version of this base model  --  with just a few optional features added on . We have come to expect that there should be no real differences between the sexes . But the science that 's emerging upends the notion that male and female are interchangeable , symmetrical , or the same . To put this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychology , neuroscience , and economics of people 's choices and behavior  --  fields that have exploded with amazing findings in the last ten years alone  --  how reasonable is it to expect that a woman be more like a man ? And how likely is it for a man to be like a woman ? This time , it 's more about describing what is , than why ca n't , or should n't , because the expectation that male is the starting point seems to have led us astray . // The assumption that female is just a slightly different shade of male was perfectly captured by the predicament the Sesame Street team found itself in when trying to invent a cast of characters for its popular preschool television show . In 2006 The New York Times reported how Sesame Street 's producers had long been stymied in creating a female lead puppet out of the anxiety that any girl-like features would play into stereotypes . " If Cookie Monster was a female character , she 'd be accused of being anorexic or bulimic , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if Elmo were female she 'd be seen as ditzy . Especially after the indignant reaction to the Muppet Show 's Miss Piggy , it just seemed safest to reflect the common assumption that male was the default setting for both sexes . Male puppets  --  whether flightless birds , hairy monsters , or earnest little boys  --  were not really male , but generically human . But any female puppets would be viewed as deviant , or as having girl-specific traits . As a result , it took thirty-seven years after Big Bird , Cookie Monster , and Elmo were created for the show 's producers to come up with Abby Cadabby , a high-spirited puppet with magical powers and a feminine aesthetic . Her distinctly female persona was a sign that people were beginning to relax about gender , but it still made the news . // I had little idea of how touchy it was when I proposed to combine two areas of personal and professional interest  --  extreme or distinctive male traits and women 's occupational choices  --  in a book about men , women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at least twenty years after they 'd had problems as children to see what had become of them . Their stories would contrast with those of gifted women with every chance of success . The human stories were compelling , but then so was the science underlying their experiences . Trying to make sense of their stories was how I entered the politically charged world of sex differences , where , as it turned out , almost everyone I would encounter had already taken sides . Along the way , I discovered that sex differences not only colored my work , but had likely affected my own choices . As in Higgins ' song , I started to wonder about myself , my female colleagues and other women I knew , " Why do they do everything their mothers do ? Why do n't they grow up like their fathers instead ? " // I 'd had every opportunity . In 1973 , at the age of sixteen , I worked for my father . In those years he was a garment manufacturer 's agent and for two summer months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-paneled station wagon , the back loaded with a dozen navy sample bags filled with women 's uniforms and sleepwear , each bag the size of a fridge and weighing about seventy-five pounds . With new respect I discovered the labor that financed our suburban , middle-class life . His years on the road eventually put three kids through college , my mother through graduate school , and would underwrite his own transition to a successful law career . The work was often lonely and physically exhausting , and like many work landscapes at the time , it was 99 percent male . // By then I was sure that a women could and would do any job a man could . In The Second Sex , Simone de Beauvoir had laid it all out : biology was not destiny . " One is not born , but rather becomes a woman . " There was no such thing as a maternal instinct  --  humans were not like animals with observable , fixed habits , like rutting deer or baboons who flashed their pink behinds . We were above all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of change , forever becoming , " an existentialist take that certainly matched my sixteen-year-old worldview . So women could be defined by their current situation and their possibilities , but that was it . If there was a healthy demand for nurses ' smocks and peignoir sets , it was because society defined women as caregivers and sex objects . But soon all this would change . Of course , I knew nothing about the gulf between this feminist classic and the particulars of the writer 's own life , how de Beauvoir allowed herself to be treated by Sartre , not as an equal , but more as an enabler and procurer of pretty young women , some of them as young as I was at the time . But that would n't have mattered . What happened in the forties and fifties was history . This was now . // Coming of age at the cusp of second-wave feminism , my expectations diverged sharply from those of previous generations . Unlike the women who matured during the Depression , I counted on an education and a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't think getting married and pregnant was a sufficient future plan . It was precisely the one that had trapped our mothers . In 1963 Betty Friedan had shredded the idyll of postwar domesticity in The Feminine Mystique , portraying suburban housewives as burdened by endless chores , whiny children , and an unnamed , enveloping anomie . These were the original desperate housewives , and Friedan 's strident demand that women reject that scenario was not just hot air . " We swallowed it whole , " recalled my mother , who had married at nineteen and then spent the next eighteen years at home " wiping the same stretch of counter over and over . " ( According to the sociologist Juliet Schor , a middle-class mother of three did an average of fifty-three hours of housework a week in 1973 . ) Galvanized by Friedan , Gloria Steinem , and others , that 1973 summer , my mother started a graduate degree . All her friends were doing the same , returning to jobs they had before they married , or seeking professional training that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other signs of a major societal attitude shift . The birth-control pill had been legal since 1969 in Canada , and some of my high school friends were already on it . A robust postwar economy had launched our sense of infinite possibility , but The Pill boosted it skyward , along with the idealism and individualism of the Vietnam era . None of us expected to have our aspirations curtailed by pregnancy or marriage  --  or to have anyone tell us what kind of work we should or could do . The Female Eunuch had just been published , and I was an instant convert to Germaine Greer 's lusty prose . Women were conditioned to have the characteristics of a castrate , she wrote , listing passivity , plumpness , timidity , languor , delicacy , and preciousness as the female virtues that were lauded by men , and thus obediently emulated by women . " The new assumption behind the discussion of the body is that everything that we may observe could be otherwise , " she wrote . Her italics captured the self-assurance of the era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only women rejected their conditioned roles by refusing to be men 's handmaids , by avoiding " menial " jobs like teaching or nursing , and by abandoning the clothes , cosmetics , and even the household appliances that enslaved them , it could be a different world . The assumption was that men had it made ; they were the standard , the ones to be emulated . Only when women dumped their female personae and took on men 's roles would they truly be equal . It was true that many women in my family and social circle were plump , but I did n't know any who were remotely passive , delicate , timid , or languorous . Still , the idea of a complete overhaul had appeal . // Feminism , along with the sixties zeitgeist , had instilled a powerful belief in the freedom of choice . Behind the cultural facade , we were equal to , if not the same as , men . And once artificial barriers came down , many women assumed we 'd lead similar lives . In fact , more progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 years , during which American women struggled  --  but failed  --  to have the same constitutional rights as had been granted to former slaves . Having been lucky enough to have been born when I was , I benefited from the hard-won achievements of second-wave feminism . Enforced domesticity did n't come crashing in on me at the age of twenty . I simply took it for granted that my views had as much value as any man 's , and that I had the same rights to education and employment , to vote , to own property , and to decide if and when I 'd have children . That I took these truths to be self-evident proved how far women and society had traveled in a short time . // Still , it never occurred to me that women would choose to do this kind of work , the work my father did for years . Sure , his earnings amply supported a family of five . But hoisting sample bags , working alone on the road , and only rarely seeing his family and friends ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // What women want , and why they want it , is half of what this book is about . The other half is about men , and whether it makes sense to see males as the base model when we think about women and work . Thirty-odd years after my first summer job , I wondered whether biology is , well , if not destiny exactly , then a profound and meaningful departure point for a discussion about sex differences . Most women in the West are now in the workplace . But gifted , talented women with the most choices and freedoms do n't seem to be choosing the same paths , in the same numbers , as the men around them . Even with barriers stripped away , they do n't behave like male clones . So I began to wonder what would happen if all the " shoulds "  --  the policy and political agendas  --  were shifted to the side for a moment to examine the science . Would female really look like an alternative version of male ? As a developmental psychologist , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of being what de Beauvoir called " the absolute vertical with reference to which the oblique is defined , " it was clear that boys and men demonstrate a wide range of biologically based foibles that make many unpredictable , others fragile , and still others reckless or even extreme . If anyone is oblique , it 's males . // For me , the question of whether males really fit our expectation of the standard , neutral gender  --  what I 'll call the " vanilla " gender  --  started in my pediatric clinic waiting room . Over twenty years of clinical practice and teaching as a child psychologist , I had seen mostly males . Boys and men with learning problems , attention problems , aggressive or antisocial boys , those with autistic features , those who did n't sleep well or make friends , or could n't sit still , dominated my practice  --  and that of every other developmental psychologist I knew . Research confirmed the gender breakdown of my waiting room . Learning problems , attention deficit disorder , and autism spectrum disorders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depression twice as common in girls . From the point of view of learning and self-control , boys are simply more vulnerable . Defining their strengths and weaknesses , and teaching others how to , had been the focus of the first half of my working life . I had been at it so long that many of my first charges were now adults , and to my surprise , I began to see some of them featured as success stories in the press . One had become a designer of international renown . Another had made money as a financial analyst and was leapfrogging from one investment bank to another . A third had become an electrical engineer who had pioneered an invention . A fourth was a chef on his way up . And there were more . These apparently fragile boys had overcome their early difficulties through the support of parents and teachers , who , after all , were attentive and observant enough to seek out a psychologist , presumably only one of many steps they might have taken with that child 's welfare in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a biological thread . In some , there seemed to be a flip side to early male vulnerability . Many of these initially fragile boys continued to have obsessive interests or an appetite for risk that set the stage for their careers . Meanwhile , many of the girls their age who were light-years ahead of them in classroom learning , language , social skills , and self-control opted for paths that would not necessarily lead them to the highest status or the most lucrative careers . They had other goals . So even if being male made childhood a bumpier road , as adults at work , the situation was reversed . // In The Sexual Paradox I examine the trajectories of these two extreme groups  --  fragile boys who later succeed , and the gifted , highly disciplined girls who eclipsed them in third grade  --  as a way of exploring sex differences . These apparent opposites challenge our assumptions . We expect that the fragile boys will continue to struggle . We expect that high-achieving girls will shoot right to the top . That so many in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex differences . If boys and girls , are on average , biologically and developmentally distinct from the start ( and I 'll walk you through some of the more intriguing evidence ) , would n't these differences affect their choices later ? Could men 's and women 's diverging developmental paths and different work priorities be linked ? // The History // The idea that there are inherent differences is a sensitive issue in the present because it provided cover for abuses in the past . Until the mid-twentieth century , a rigid gender gap enforced by law and tradition was the rule . Except for a tiny elite , few women had any choices . And without choices , what they wanted was moot . They could take in boarders , washing , or piecework , but up to the Second World War , married women could n't be hired in most states in the United States , Canada , or Britain ( Australia 's civil service banned married women until 1966 ) . So single women who got hitched were duly sacked , barred from jobs in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely to find work . Factories had always employed women but usually paid them less , so unions saw them as a form of scab labor that undercut men 's livelihoods . Even after the privations of the Depression and the war years , when women were aggressively recruited to factory and munitions jobs to keep the economy chugging along , having a wife who " did n't work " and earning a " family wage " were seen as a woman 's privilege and a man 's duty . Never mind Rosie the Riveter , who flexed her biceps on recruitment posters and was " on a sharp lookout for sabotage , sitting up there on the fuselage , " according to the popular song . When the war ended , there were gains for some women , especially for black women , but for most there was a regression to the status quo . Gender discrimination was rife , and with no birth control , few formal jobs , and little access to money or property , women were often trapped by their circumstances . // Second-wave feminism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen next . Women became an undeniable presence in the workplace , their numbers ballooning in a single generation  --  my own . In 1930 , 25 percent of the workforce was female . In 1950 , it had risen to 29 percent , but by 1975 it had become a wave of more than 40 percent , reaching 47 percent by 2005 . Women got the vote in 1918 in Canada , 1920 in the United States , and 1928 in Britain , but it was only in the 1970s that women began to flood educational programs that trained them to become doctors , lawyers , and architects , just a few of the careers formerly identified as male . This generational attitude shift was duly reflected in public policy . Through the sixties and seventies , equal-rights laws were introduced in Britain , the United States , the European Union , and Canada that made it illegal to discriminate against women or to pay them any less than men . Ironically , given its role as the tinderbox of social upheaval in the sixties , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum to write gender equity laws into its constitution  --  despite thirty-five years of debate and rollicking support for the idea . Instead there were targeted statutes that made workplace discrimination and sexual harassment illegal ( the 1963 Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ) and prevented publicly funded schools from offering programs on the basis of sex ( Title IX , enacted in 1972 ) . A long time coming , these statutes still created controversial fallout . While eliminating obvious injustices such as separate pay scales for men and women and infelicities like " boom-boom rooms , " where male employees socialized with strippers , the laws also whitewashed any fundamental differences between the sexes , creating absurd situations where allowances for pregnancy or all-male soccer teams suddenly became discriminatory practices . Still , there was no doubt that an overwhelming social movement was afoot in the West , one aimed to redress the inequalities of the past with protective legislation and affirmative action programs designed to bump up the numbers of girls and women in schools and workplaces . // Gender equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the baby-boom generation , had unintended effects . Together they created the expectation that all differences between men and women were created by unjust practices and therefore could be erased by changing same . With new laws and policies in place and women making up almost half of the workforce , there was a leap of faith that it was only a matter of time before all occupations would be split 50-50 . Equal numbers of men and women working side by side , doing exactly the same work for exactly the same number of hours and pay , seemed a logical extension of the sixties-based egalitarian ideal . So when 50-50 did n't happen in all jobs by the year 2000 , there was a vast feeling of letdown . " Full equality is still a distant promise , " wrote British journalist Natasha Walters in 2005 , about the fact that women 's salaries when averaged are 85 percent of the average male salary . " What 's Wrong with This Picture ? " ran the headline of a 2007 article by the Feminist Research Center , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be 475 years , or not until the year 2466 before women reach equality with men in the executive suite . " ( At 16.4 percent of all corporate officers in Fortune 500 companies in 2005 , that estimate for women is n't quite right . At current rates of increase , it would take another 40 , not 475 years , to have female and male CEOs in equal numbers , according to projections by Catalyst , another women 's research group . ) Still , the assumption seemed to be that if the social order had really changed , women would be exactly like men by now . They 'd make the same choices , opting in equal proportions for chief executive positions , careers in theoretical physics , or political office . Even among women who have n't chosen such fields themselves , the wider the discrepancy from 50 percent , the greater the sense of chagrin . That 's because it is largely taken for granted that gender discrimination is what is behind these numbers . And though discrimination still exists  --  both Wall Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel their advancement has been blocked  --  as I talked to high-achieving women and started to look at the data , it became clear that women 's and men 's interests and preferences are also skewing the picture . Equal opportunity does n't necessarily lead to equal results . In fact , women 's preferences stand out in higher relief precisely because they a little , we can get a feeling for the pursuits women choose once doors are opened to them . // One of the most remarkable transformations over this period has taken place on the university campus . In 1960 , 39 percent of undergraduate students were female . Now 58 percent of American university students are ; indeed , women outnumber men on college campuses throughout the developed world . Their strong academic profiles and broad extracurricular interests  --  in everything from debating to building houses for Habitat for Humanity  --  have meant that high-achieving women have their pick of schools and disciplines . Professional degree programs in law , medicine , pharmacy , and biology , all fields formerly dominated by men , are now evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  clinical psychology and veterinary medicine  --  are now between 70 and 80 percent female . Clearly , girls and women are excelling in the classroom and making significant inroads outside it , so efforts to narrow the gender gap have succeeded in Western countries . Fifty-six percent of all high-paying professional jobs are now held by women , and women hold more than half of all professional and managerial positions in Canada and Britain.16 Even at the top echelons of business , where female executives have been notoriously absent in the past , a 2006 study of 10,000 Fortune 500 companies has uncovered an interesting phenomenon . While almost half the companies have no women at the helm , the other half promote more women to executive officer positions , and they move them up faster  --  when they 're younger and have less experience than men in comparable positions ( the women are promoted after an average of 2.6 years on the job while in their forties , the men after 3.5 years and in their fifties ) . Currently , any gender gaps in pay are narrower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many parts of the world where girls still ca n't go to school ; are forced into labor , prostitution , or marriage as young teenagers ; and as adults ca n't work outside the home or vote . But in Western democracies , what 's the problem ? Why are n't people celebrating ? // One reason for the continued hand-wringing is that though women have flooded certain disciplines where they had been rare a few decades ago , there are still noticeable discrepancies in others . More women are studying engineering , physics , and computer science than ever before , but they are not exactly falling over themselves to enter those fields the way they have in medicine and law . Even with dozens of task forces and millions consecrated to increasing gender diversity , female enrollment in engineering in most schools has n't budged past 20 percent . Men have entered teaching , nursing , and social work  --  but these , too , remain predominantly female enclaves . Even with more choices , women still cluster in certain occupations , just as men continue to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are concerned is that when earnings are averaged by sex , men still earn more . These global figures usually blend disparate occupations , different subspecialties , and work schedules into one undifferentiated blob . In the following pages we 'll see how biologically based leanings and preferences might influence the telling details for both sexes . Boys ' developmental differences may shine some light on why their school performance and university attendance lag behind girls ' . Meanwhile women 's priorities  --  wide-ranging and often people-based  --  infuse their career choices . Despite increased opportunities and affirmative action programs , many women routinely turn their noses up at many occupations now open to them , among them computer programming , cutting down trees for pulp and paper , and politics . From their educational profiles , it 's clear that when it comes to making career choices , it 's not a question of " ca n't . " Nor is it a question of " should n't , " as most formerly male dominions have made significant investments to recruit women . Yet the question of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories here . One of the pressures gifted , high-achieving women feel keenly is to make the same choices as men . This brings us back to men , and whether it makes sense for them to be their models . // The Extremes // " There is no female Mozart because there is no female Jack the Ripper , " wrote the social critic Camille Paglia , and her quip hints at a biological truth . Compared to women , there are more men who are extreme . Even though the two sexes are well matched in most areas , including intelligence , there are fewer women than men at the extreme ends of the normal distribution . Men are simply more variable . Their " means , " or the average scores for the group , are roughly the same as those of women , but their individual scores are scattered more widely . So there are more very stupid men and more very smart ones , more extremely lazy ones and more willing to kill themselves with work . There are more men with biological frailties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by other deficits , such as the very problems dogging the children in my waiting room . The bell curve simply looks different for males , with more men at the tail ends of the distribution , where their measured skills are either dismal , stellar , or a mix of the two . So even though male and female averages are the same , there are more male outliers  --  and more " normal " women overall . Comparing men and women in the middle ranges one finds fewer sex differences , but at the extremes the picture looks  --  well  --  extreme . // Sex differences at the extremes was one of the issues that sank the former president of Harvard University , Larry Summers . This book was already under way in January 2005 , when I received an e-mail from one of my literary agents . " Did you see this ? " she wrote , attaching an electronic article from that morning 's New York Times . Summers had made a speech to a science and engineering diversity conference on the origin of sex differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a thousand articles in the press , sparked a year of bitter dissent at Harvard , prompted several public apologies from Summers , and ultimately a commitment of $50 million to hire and promote female and minority faculty at the university . Still , by 2006 he was forced out . What was the fuss about ? Summers conjectured that there were three reasons for the paucity of women in high-level science and engineering faculty positions . The first was that these jobs are so greedy that many women avoid them . " What fraction of young women in their mid-twenties make a decision that they do n't want to have a job that they think about eighty hours a week ? What fraction of young men make a decision that they 're unwilling to have a job that they think about eighty hours a week ? " he said , adding that whether it 's correct for society to ask for that commitment is a different question . His second point was about male variability . If men are more variable than women , then there will be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution . So in research positions in physics or engineering that compete for a tiny fraction of human talent at the very top end  --  where there are not only very few women , but also very few men  --  one might find more extreme sex differences , he said . This was not a new idea and was one that at least a dozen researchers had already mapped out . One Edinburgh psychologist , Ian Deary , had even documented the phenomenon after examining the records of more than 80,000 children , nearly every child born in Scotland in 1921 . At age eleven , boys ' and girls ' IQ scores were no different , on average , Deary 's team found . But the difference in male variability was unmistakable : there were significantly more boys than girls at the low and high extremes of ability . // For more than a decade , other researchers  --  Amy Nowell , Larry Hedges , Alan Feingold , Diane Halpern , Camilla Benbow and Julian Stanley , Yu Xie , Kimberlee Shauman , the Scholastic Aptitude Testing Service , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written about the same phenomenon , but in Summers ' case it caused a furious uproar that would n't abate . " I felt I was going to be sick , " said MIT biology professor Nancy Hopkins , who reported that Summers ' comments upset her so much that " my heart was pounding and my breath was shallow . " Summers went on to talk about a third factor  --  socialization and continuing discrimination  --  but few listened . His message about extremes , standard deviations , and greedy jobs had been distilled as " women are not as good as men at math and science . " The electric atmosphere surrounding the discussion of sex differences became even more charged . // So the issue of biologically based sex differences was already in the spotlight when I stepped into the fray . But a chill had settled on many researchers ' willingness to talk about their work . Several female scientists who are experts in the area declined to be interviewed ; they did n't want to draw attention to anything that could be seen as politically incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I asked a female social scientist why she thought highly intelligent , successful women might be making different occupational choices than men , she burst out angrily , " Not that again ! " I naively asked , " Not what again ? " " Not that choice thing again ! " I had unwittingly touched a sore spot . Apparently in " choice feminism " women are free to choose whatever jobs appeal to them  --  to work part-time , full-time , or not at all  --  and still call themselves feminists . But this offshoot had ended up challenging the idea that any deviation from the male standard would be a retrograde step for women , as many smart and capable women were not making " male " choices . Never mind individual differences and desires . Equal opportunity for women  --  a principle I hold dear  --  was supposed to lead to a mathematically equal result . That it has n't has sparked the incendiary Mommy Wars and a lingering feeling among scientists that the topic is taboo . // But scientists are n't the only voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their careers and why they made their decisions . None of the profiles in this book are composites or fictionalized , although identifying details have occasionally been altered . The interviews with the men and women took on a self-reflexive quality , as all the women asked me to give them pseudonyms and the majority of the so-called fragile men insisted that I use their real names . As a result , the women whose stories are recounted here are referred to with a fictitious first name . When first and family names are used in this book , as is the case with most of the men profiled here , this is the person 's real name . It was my decision to use pseudonyms for the few young men still in their early twenties , just in case they might regret being identified in a few years . Even though all the men had sensitive clinical histories , they seemed less concerned about appearing vulnerable than the women were about seeming uncommitted to their science or professional backgrounds . Although all the women spoke volubly and sensitively about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second thoughts about participating  --  even with pseudonyms and a change of costume and hair color . None of the men had these reservations . Perhaps these men had struggled so much for their successes that they saw them as triumphs . Perhaps the freedom of women to make choices is still too recent for them to feel invincible . // " Confidence is a very fragile thing , " said NFL football player Joe Montana . While it 's hard to imagine a quarterback as much of an authority on fragility , the unusual men profiled in this book and the underlying data show that men are neither standard nor generic . Nor are they always the right models for women 's career aspirations . After all , many men demonstrate a wide range of strengths and disabilities that skews their development as well as their fortunes . Men are more prone to developmental disabilities , to get sick , hurt , or kill others . They are also more likely to work extreme hours at extreme jobs and to die younger . The Sexual Paradox shows how these characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as variations on their own theme will give a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be male . And instead of viewing women as frustrated versions of this male model , gifted women will explain why , after trying it on , that model did n't quite fit . // In reality , neither sex is a souped-up or flawed version of the other . In this book , men are not given short shrift as unfeeling , uncomplicated louts . And women are not portrayed as hapless victims prevented from achieving their goals . The stories these two groups tell and the science behind them , are the ciphers through which I examine basic sex differences . These apparent opposites  --  fragile men , gifted women  --  provide an unusual lens on the gender debate . If they are extremes on a continuum , then whatever is driving them is also true for the rest of us. //
