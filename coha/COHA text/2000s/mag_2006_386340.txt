. The first reactor-on-a-barge will bring power to Russia 's electricity-starved Arctic . WHILE THE U.S. hems and haws over reviving nuclear energy as a less expensive alternative to oil , Russia has dug back 30 years in our nuclear history to find a solution for some of its own energy woes : the floating nuclear power plant . The Russian nuclear-energy company Rosenergoatom is planning a mobile plant to deliver electricity to hard-to-reach northern territories near the White Sea , where harsh weather makes regular coal and oil fuel deliveries unreliable and expensive . The $200-million floating plant  --  slated for construction next year  --  could provide relatively inexpensive , reliable electricity to 200,000 people . Although the concept of a waterborne nuke plant might sound outlandish , it is n't new , nor did it originate in Russia . Westinghouse Electric Company considered the idea in the 1970s and built an immense dry-dock facility in Jacksonville , Florida , where plants would be launched and floated north along the Eastern Seaboard , conveniently doling out power to towns in need . Engineers would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased quality control and reduced production costs before tugging a plant to its port of call . But ultimately , says retired Westinghouse consultant Richard Orr , energy conservation following the 1973 OPEC oil embargo killed the project . The Russian plan is to mount two reactors on a football-field-size barge , float it to a port , connect power lines to the mainland , and turn on the reactors , providing communities with affordable electricity . The plant will store waste and spent fuel in an onboard facility that workers will empty every 10 to 12 years during regular maintenance overhauls . After 40 years , the normal life span for a nuclear plant , the decommissioned plant would be towed away and replaced with a new one . The reactor and spent fuel would go to a storage facility , but the barge could be recycled . Yet because the safety of the Russian facility is still unknown , the prospect of resurrecting the Westinghouse idea in the White Sea has drawn protest from environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Norwegian foundation Bellona . One concern is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . An even bigger fear is that a nasty storm could cut the plant off from the land-based power supply required to run plant operations . Should emergency generators fail , says David Lochbaum , director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists , a Chernobyl-like disaster could ensue . In a worst-case scenario , an overheated core could melt through the bottom of the barge and drop into the water , creating a radioactive steam explosion . Such a cloud could do far more damage than the plume of nuclear fallout kicked up by the 1986 explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former U.S.S.R. , Lochbaum notes , because the human body absorbs radioactive water droplets more easily than it does radioactive ash . " Its worst day would be much worse than a land power plant 's , " he says . Sergey Obozov , acting director for Rosenergoatom , says that reactors at sea have a proven safety record : The facility would be powered by two 60-megawatt KLT-40S reactors adapted from those already in use on three Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist with the Monterey Institute for International Studies in California , cautions that subtle performance differences might arise when running the reactor for pure energy generation instead of propulsion , noting that the cooling system remains unproven . Although the technology exists to contain a burning core , Rosenergoatom wo n't say if the plant  --  which was designed a decade ago  --  will include the most modern safety measures . With a building permit in hand , Rosenergoatom aims to have the facility afloat in the port city of Severodvinsk in the southeastern White Sea by late 2010 " The Russians have learned a lot about safety from the U.S. Department of Energy , Sweden and Norway  --  who probably all wish the Russians would focus on things other than a floating nuclear power plant , " says Chuen , who adds that she wishes the planning process were more transparent . " Maybe it will turn out great , but I just hope they did all the research to make sure it 's safe . " BOX THIS MONTH 38 Grow the greenest home on the block 46 Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found !
