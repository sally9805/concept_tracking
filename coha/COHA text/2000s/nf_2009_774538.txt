1 On Liberty and Tyranny // There is simply no scientific or mathematical formula that defines conservatism . Moreover , there are competing voices today claiming the mantle of " true conservatism "  --  including neo-conservatism ( emphasis on a robust national security ) , paleo-conservatism ( emphasis on preserving the culture ) , social conservatism ( emphasis on faith and values ) , and libertarianism ( emphasis on individualism ) , among others . Scores of scholars have written at length about what can be imperfectly characterized as conservative thought . But my purpose is not to give them each exposition , as it can not be fairly or adequately accomplished here , nor referee among them . Neither will I attempt to give birth to totally new theories . // Instead , what follows are my own opinions and conclusions of fundamental truths , based on decades of observation , exploration , and experience , about conservatism and , conversely , non-conservatism  --  that is , liberty and tyranny in modern America . // To put it succinctly : Conservatism is a way of understanding life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by certain philosophers , among them Adam Smith ( spontaneous order ) , Charles Montesquieu ( separation of powers ) , and especially John Locke ( natural rights ) ; they were also influenced by their faiths , personal experiences , and knowledge of history ( including the rise and fall of the Roman Empire ) . Edmund Burke , who was both a British statesman and thinker , is often said to be the father of modern conservatism . He was an early defender of the American Revolution and advocate of representative government . He wrote of the interconnection of liberty , free markets , religion , tradition , and authority . The Conservative , like the Founders , is informed by all these great thinkers  --  and more . // The Declaration of Independence represents the most prominent official , consensus position of the Founders ' rationale for declaring independence from England . It states , in part , // When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .... // The Founders believed , and the Conservative agrees , in the dignity of the individual ; that we , as human beings , have a right to live , live freely , and pursue that which motivates us not because man or some government says so , but because these are God-given natural rights . // Like the Founders , the Conservative also recognizes in society a harmony of interests , as Adam Smith put it , and rules of cooperation that have developed through generations of human experience and collective reasoning that promote the betterment of the individual and society . This is characterized as ordered liberty , the social contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this civil society ? // In the civil society , the individual is recognized and accepted as more than an abstract statistic or faceless member of some group ; rather , he is a unique , spiritual being with a soul and a conscience . He is free to discover his own potential and pursue his own legitimate interests , tempered , however , by a moral order that has its foundation in faith and guides his life and all human life through the prudent exercise of judgment . As such , the individual in the civil society strives , albeit imperfectly , to be virtuous  --  that is , restrained , ethical , and honorable . He rejects the relativism that blurs the lines between good and bad , right and wrong , just and unjust , and means and ends . // In the civil society , the individual has a duty to respect the unalienable rights of others and the values , customs , and traditions , tried and tested over time and passed from one generation to the next , that establish society 's cultural identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of his family . And he has a duty as a citizen to contribute voluntarily to the welfare of his community through good works . // In the civil society , private property and liberty are inseparable . The individual 's right to live freely and safely and pursue happiness includes the right to acquire and possess property , which represents the fruits of his own intellectual and/or physical labor . As the individual 's time on earth is finite , so , too , is his labor . The illegitimate denial or diminution of his private property enslaves him to another and denies him his liberty . // In the civil society , a rule of law , which is just , known , and predictable , and applied equally albeit imperfectly , provides the governing framework for and restraints on the polity , thereby nurturing the civil society and serving as a check against the arbitrary use and , hence , abuse of power . // For the Conservative , the civil society has as its highest purpose its preservation and improvement . // The Modern Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of the Declaration and the order of the civil society , in whole or part . For the Modern Liberal , the individual 's imperfection and personal pursuits impede the objective of a utopian state . In this , Modern Liberalism promotes what French historian Alexis de Tocqueville described as a soft tyranny , which becomes increasingly more oppressive , potentially leading to a hard tyranny ( some form of totalitarianism ) . As the word " liberal " is , in its classical meaning , the opposite of authoritarian , it is more accurate , therefore , to characterize the Modern Liberal as a Statist . // The Founders understood that the greatest threat to liberty is an all-powerful central government , where the few dictate to the many . They also knew that the rule of the mob would lead to anarchy and , in the end , despotism . During the Revolutionary War , the states more or less followed the Articles of Confederation , in which most governing authority remained with the states . After the war , as the Founders labored to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent . The central government did not have the ability to fund itself . Moreover , states were issuing their own currency , conducting their own foreign policy , and raising their own armies . Trade disputes among the states and with other countries were hampering commerce and threatening national prosperity . // Eventually the Articles were replaced with the Constitution , which granted the federal government enough authority to cultivate , promote , and " secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , " but not enough authority to destroy it all . James Madison , the most influential of the Constitution 's authors , put it best when he wrote in " Federalist 51 " : // But what is government itself , but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ? If men were angels , no government would be necessary . If angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary . In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men , the great difficulty lies in this : you must first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next place oblige it to control itself . // For much of American history , the balance between governmental authority and individual liberty was understood and accepted . Federal power was confined to that which was specifically enumerated in the Constitution and no more . And that power was further limited , for it was dispersed among three federal branches  --  the legislative , executive , and judicial . Beyond that , the power remained with the states and ultimately the people . // The Framers recognized that the Constitution may require adjustments from time to time . Therefore , they provided two methods for proposing amendments , only one of which has been used in adopting all current amendments . It requires a supermajority of two-thirds of the members of both Houses of Congress to propose an amendment to the states for ratification , and three-fourths of the states to successfully ratify the proposed amendment . In all our history the Constitution has been amended only twenty-seven times  --  the first ten of which , the Bill of Rights , were adopted shortly after the Constitution was ratified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily altered . It was to be a lasting contract that could be modified only by the considered judgment of a significant representation of the body politic. // But in the 1930s , during the Great Depression , the Statists successfully launched a counterrevolution that radically and fundamentally altered the nature of American society . President Franklin Roosevelt and an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress , through an array of federal projects , entitlements , taxes , and regulations known as the New Deal , breached the Constitution 's firewalls . At first the Supreme Court fought back , striking down New Deal programs as exceeding the limits of federal constitutional authority , violating state sovereignty , and trampling on private property rights . But rather than seek an expansion of federal power through the amendment process , which would likely have blunted Roosevelt 's ambitions , Roosevelt threatened the very makeup of the Court by proposing to pack it with sympathetic justices who would go along with his counterrevolution . Although Roosevelt 's plan failed , the justices had been effectively intimidated . And new justices , who shared Roosevelt 's statism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not long before the Court became little more than a rubber stamp for Roosevelt 's policies . // The federal government began passing laws and creating administrative agencies at a dizzying pace , increasing its control over economic activity and , hence , individual liberty . It used taxation not merely to fund constitutionally legitimate governmental activities , but also to redistribute wealth , finance welfare programs , set prices and production limits , create huge public works programs , and establish pension and unemployment programs . Roosevelt used his new power to expand political alliances and create electoral constituencies  --  unions , farmers , senior citizens , and ethnic groups . From this era forward , the Democratic Party and the federal government would become inextricably intertwined , and the Democratic Party would become as dependent on federal power for its sustenance as the governmental dependents it would create . Ironically , industrial expansion resulting from World War II eventually ended the Great Depression , not the New Deal . Indeed , the enormous tax and regulatory burden imposed on the private sector by the New Deal prolonged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in any one program , but in its sweeping break from our founding principles and constitutional limitations . Roosevelt himself broke with the two-presidential-term tradition started by George Washington by running for four terms . His legacy includes a federal government that has become a massive , unaccountable conglomerate : It is the nation 's largest creditor , debtor , lender , employer , consumer , contractor , grantor , property owner , tenant , insurer , health-care provider , and pension guarantor . // And yet , the Statist has an insatiable appetite for control . His sights are set on his next meal even before he has fully digested his last . He is constantly agitating for government action . And in furtherance of that purpose , the Statist speaks in the tongue of the demagogue , concocting one pretext and grievance after another to manipulate public perceptions and build popular momentum for the divestiture of liberty and property from its rightful possessors . The industrious , earnest , and successful are demonized as perpetrators of various offenses against the public good , which justifies governmental intervention on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way , the perpetrator and the victim are subordinated to the government 's authority  --  the former by outright theft , the latter by a dependent existence . In truth , both are made victims by the real perpetrator , the Statist. // The Statist veils his pursuits in moral indignation , intoning in high dudgeon the injustices and inequities of liberty and life itself , for which only he can provide justice and bring a righteous resolution . And when the resolution proves elusive , as it undoubtedly does  --  whether the Marxist promise of " the workers ' paradise " or the Great Society 's " war on poverty "  --  the Statist demands ever more authority to wring out the imperfections of mankind 's existence . Unconstrained by constitutional prohibitions , what is left to limit the Statist 's ambitions but his own moral compass , which has already led him astray ? He is never circumspect about his own shortcomings . Failure is not the product of his beliefs but merely want of power and resources . Thus are born endless rationalizations for seizing ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , who was a predominate focus of the Founders . When living freely and pursuing his own legitimate interests , the individual displays qualities that are antithetical to the Statist 's  --  initiative , self-reliance , and independence . As the Statist is building a culture of conformity and dependency , where the ideal citizen takes on dronelike qualities in service to the state , the individual must be drained of uniqueness and self-worth , and deterred from independent thought or behavior . This is achieved through varying methods of economic punishment and political suppression . // The Statist also knows that despite his successful usurpations , enough citizens are still skeptical and even distrustful of politicians and government that he can not force his will all at once . Thus he marches in incremental steps , adjusting his pace as circumstances dictate . Today his pace is more rapid , for resistance has slowed . And at no time does the Statist do an about-face . But not so with some who claim the mantle of conservatism but are , in truth , neo-Statists , who would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quicksand of a soft tyranny . // Michael Gerson , formerly chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush , has written in his book , Heroic Conservatism , that " if Republicans run in future elections with a simplistic anti-government message , ignoring the poor , the addicted and children at risk , they will lose , and they will deserve to lose . " Gerson argues for a " compassionate conservatism " and " faith-based initiatives " in which the federal government plays a central role . // Gerson all but ignores liberty 's successes and the civil society in which humans flourish , even though he is surrounded in his every moment by its magnificence . So numerous are liberty 's treasures that they defy cataloguing . The object of Gerson 's scorn is misplaced . Gerson does not ask , " How many enterprises and jobs might have been created , how many people might have been saved from illness and disease , how many more poor children might have been fed but for the additional costs , market dislocations , and management inefficiencies that distort supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the federal government 's role ? " // Liberty 's permeance in American society often makes its manifestations elusive or invisible to those born into it . Even if liberty is acknowledged , it is often taken for granted and its permanence assumed . Therefore , under these circumstances , the Statist 's agenda can be alluring even to a former advisor to a Republican president . It is not recognized as an increasingly corrosive threat to liberty but rather as coexisting with it . // Columnists William Kristol and David Brooks promote something called " national-greatness conservatism . " They coauthored an opinion piece in which they exclaimed that it " does not despise government . How could it ? How can Americans love their nation if they hate its government ? But the way to restore faith in our government is to slash its flabbiness while making it more effective . " // The Conservative does not despise government . He despises tyranny . This is precisely why the Conservative reveres the Constitution and insists on adherence to it . An " effective " government that operates outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle for efficiency , the neo-Statist , it seems , is no more bound to the Constitution than is the Statist . He marches more slowly than the Statist , but he marches with him nonetheless . The neo-Statist propounds no discernable standard or practical means to hem in the federal power he helps unleash , and which the Statist would exploit . In many ways , he is as objectionable as the Statist , for he seeks to devour conservatism by clothing himself in its nomenclature . // The Conservative is alarmed by the ascent of a soft tyranny and its cheery acceptance by the neo-Statist . He knows that liberty once lost is rarely recovered . He knows of the decline and eventual failure of past republics . And he knows that the best prescription for addressing society 's real and perceived ailments is not to further empower an already enormous federal government beyond its constitutional limits , but to return to the founding principles . A free people living in a civil society , working in self-interested cooperation , and a government operating within the limits of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people than any alternative . Conservatism is the antidote to tyranny precisely because its principles are the founding principles . //
