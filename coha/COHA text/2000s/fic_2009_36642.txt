Trenton July , the mayor of Henry Adams , Kansas , called the emergency town meeting to order with a bang of his gavel . " All right . Let 's get this started . Who wants to go first ? " <p> Riley Curry , the former mayor , rose to his feet . He was wearing his favorite pinstriped suit with its ever-present fake red carnation pinned to the shiny worn lapel . As always , he looked around for a moment to make sure all eyes were on him before speaking . " I 'll start by demanding we rescind the offer . " <p> Murmurs of agreement rose from some of the thirty or so folks seated on the worn wooden folding chairs in the church 's small sanctuary , but Trent saw disapproval on the faces of those who disagreed . " Offer 's already been accepted , Riley . We signed the papers two weeks ago . Next person . " <p> " I 'm not done . " <p> Trent sighed . " Go ahead . " <p> Riley cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smiling up at him as if he were the Second Coming , then declared , " The idea that you held this vote behind my back speaks to the underhandedness of the whole affair . I say we vote again . " <p> Some people clapped loudly . <p> " We 're not having another vote , " Trent replied evenly . " And nothing was done behind your back . You knew what day we were holding the vote , just like everybody else . " <p> " But I had to leave town . Which would n't have been necessary if we had a competent vet instead of that drunken  --  " <p> " Watch it , " Trent warned coolly . <p> Riley puffed up and whined , " Okay , but if we 'd had a real vet , I wouldn't 've had to drive Cletus fifty miles downstate to get him treated . " <p> Cletus was Riley 's hog . Every three or four months , Cletus had to see a vet . It 's a necessity when you feed a hog stuff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doubles as the child you and your wife could never have . <p> Trent told him , " Sorry about Cletus , but there was no reason to change the date . Your one vote would n't have made a difference anyway . Proposal passed thirty-five to seventeen . " There were only fifty-two registered voters on the town 's rolls , and for once everybody turned out to have a say . <p> But Riley was n't having any . " My constituents demand a revote . Who knows what this person 's real agenda is ? And a white woman too ? Suppose she 's just a front for people who want to build a casino or God forbid a strip club ? " <p> More murmurs of agreement were heard . <p> Trent 's jaw tightened . <p> " What do we know about her ? Suppose she 's one of those Aryan Nation folks wanting to turn Henry Adams into a terrorist training camp ? " <p> Trent opened his mouth to argue but knew it would n't matter so he closed it . <p> Riley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those supporting him and those who did n't and asked , " Is the buyer even American ? " <p> " Ms. Brown lives in Florida , " Trent drawled . " Last I heard it was still part of the U.S. " <p> " My constituents and I  --  " <p> Marie Jefferson snarled , " You do n't have any constituents , Riley . That 's why you 're the former mayor . " <p> " Ouch ! " someone cringed loudly . <p> Snickers greeted that . <p> Marie , the town 's retired school teacher stood up and glared at Riley from behind her signature cat's-eye glasses . " This is ridiculous . Henry Adams needs help now ! Not tomorrow , not a year from now , but now , and Trent 's found a way to make that happen . " She looked around the sanctuary . " No , we do n't know who this Ms. B. E. Brown person is , and we do n't know what she plans to do , but she 's agreed to keep the town intact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's a mistake ? " Riley 's wife , Genevieve , threw back . <p> " What if it 's not ? " Marie countered . " We do n't know how this will play out . Before it 's over we may regret selling , but the only idea Riley had was for us to be annexed by the city of Franklin . Annexed ! The ancestors did n't build this town out of blood and sweat for it to be annexed and assimilated and forgotten . " <p> Applause filled the church . <p> She added , " If this buyer , whoever she is , can come in here and save this place , I 'm all for it . And all y'all who voted against the sale  --  get over yourselves . " She sat . <p> More applause . Trent wanted to kiss her . <p> But Riley was still on his feet . " I will take this to the highest court in the land . Selling a town on cyberspace ca n't be legal anyway , no matter what Trent says ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side yelled for Riley to sit his you know what down . Tempers flared . Verbal shots began to fly . Folks stormed to their feet in defense of themselves and their positions , and before Trent could tell everybody to sit down , all perdition broke loose . <p> " Order ! " Trent yelled over the chaos . He banged the gavel against the table with so much force its head went flying across the room . " Order , dammit ! " <p> But the shouting combatants , people who 'd been friends and neighbors all their lives , were n't feeling him . <p> In the middle of the melee , Agnes Jefferson , who was Marie 's mother , a Riley supporter , and a descendant of the town 's first Black sheriff shook her cane in the face of her best friend , Tamar July . " You traitor ! You voted to sell our town ! " <p> Tamar , Trent 's grandmother , snapped back . " Yes I did because I 'm not stuck in the past , Agnes . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , it 's going to be me and you ! " <p> " You touch me and I 'll take you down like Hulk Hogan ! " <p> They were a nose a part . <p> Trent watched wearily . With his gavel dead and no one paying him a bit of attention , he threw up his hands and walked out . <p> The cool night air was a blessed relief to the heat and anger swirling around inside . Sighing , he pulled out his cigarettes . After lighting one , he drew the smoke deep down into his lungs and slowly exhaled . <p> <br> Continues ...
