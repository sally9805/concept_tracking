In some libraries , noise is good <p> " I 'm a bad person to go to a movie with , " says Greg Budney , curator of the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds at Cornell University . He sometimes reacts to details that other people miss . He now rustles around his desk for a list he keeps of moments in movies that have disturbed him . " In Black Hawk Down , that scene where Delta Force is leaving Mogadishu and a soldier tries to call his wife , " Budney says , " you hear a chiffchaff in the background ! " In real life , the little birds called chiffchaffs live in Europe . <p> " There were Pacific tree frogs in The Hunt for Red October-in a Maine estuary , " he says . " It was horrible . " <p> Not that he ca n't take a joke . Early in Raiders of the Lost Ark , the long , raucous call of an Australian kookaburra rings out in the Americas , but Budney appreciates it as homage to the corny roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite sounds in the whole movie , " he says . " Early Tarzan movies all had a kookaburra . " <p> Not everyone hears the sounds of nature with the mixed blessing of Budney 's highly tuned ears . Yet he contends that the sounds of birds , frogs , crickets , or whatever creatures are out there make a powerful part of the experience of nature for most people , regardless of whether they 're knowledgeable about chiffchaffs ' whereabouts . " Well-recorded sound has a remarkable ability to transport people , " he says . <p> The library where Budney works is now the largest in the world devoted to preserving and archiving nature 's sounds , with 150,000 recordings of 6,700 species and counting . In the United States , Ohio State University and the Florida Museum of Natural History also have substantial collections , and a worldwide tally includes about 14 sound libraries . Even patrons of the British Library in London can take a break from poring over Shakespearean first folios to hear a crested gibbon recorded in Vietnam , a screaming piha from Peru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from some of the great names in field biology , as well as from people taking a break from other professions . The fruits of these efforts draw scientists , conservation activists , merchandisers , and moviemakers . Sound librarians have even dug up recordings to be transmogrified into unnatural sounds , such as special effects in science fiction movies . <p> EARLY BIRDS Now libraries record creatures ranging from insects to reptiles , but what inspired many of the pioneers in nature recording were bird songs . In the British Library , the earliest surviving recording of a natural song , made by sound-collecting enthusiast Ludwig Koch , still preserves on a wax cylinder the sound of a thrush singing in 1889 . <p> The possibility that modern technology might capture the songs of birds came to intrigue the first ornithology professor in the United States , Arthur Allen . He joined the Cornell faculty in 1915 , and during the 1920s , he and his students were experimenting with catching bird songs on film used for the sound in the new motion pictures . It remained the medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the equipment was portable only in the sense that it could fit in a truck . <p> The mid-1930s brought a new technology : equipment that could be lugged into the field to cut grooves into 12-inch , 78-rpm disks . Allen 's team embraced the change , as did Koch , despite various drawbacks . Koch 's memoirs recount the complications on one of his recording jaunts when he gave a lift to a soldier , who lit up a cigarette . An ash ignited the flammable disc parings that had collected in the car seat . <p> Magnetic tape , developed in Germany during World War II , opened the era of reel-to-reel recordings , and all but the youngest libraries still have shelves of them . Today , sound collectors are moving to digital equipment , says Budney . In the corner of the 800-square-foot climate-controlled chamber that houses his library 's magnetic tapes now stand two of what he calls DVD jukeboxes . <p> Collecting sounds " requires a great deal of patience , but there are great rewards , " says Linda Macaulay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the library-she and her husband , William , contributed funds for its facilities-and she 's recorded more than 2,500 species for the collection . <p> Some of her rarest recordings come from birds that she knew where to find , but traveling to them was a challenge . For example , she trekked to northeast Gabon to record the gray-necked rockfowl , which builds big mud nests in caves there . The bald-headed birds , a little bigger than doves , emerged to hop around in the sunlight , making " very small " noises , she says . Her 1995 recording was the first that Cornell had received of the species , and since Ebola broke out in that part of Gabon 2 years after she visited , she 's not expecting a lot of people to rush in to make more recordings . <p> Reaching an animal is n't the only problem , says Richard Ranft , curator of the British Library 's National Sound Archive Wildlife Section . The creature has to cooperate and make some noise . <p> A bat expert once asked Ranft to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had done before . During the day , when the scientists could work easily , the bats used fleshy , disk-shaped suction cups on their wings to cling quietly to the insides of furled banana leaves . <p> Trying to work with free-flying bats at night was n't practical because they are so small . " You can fit a pair of them in a matchbox , " says Ranft . He finally succeeded by carrying a tent to the margins of banana plantations and creating a makeshift flight tunnel . During daylight , he woke a bat and eased it into the darkened tent , where it had to use sonar to navigate . <p> Unfortunately , the problem then became too much noise . Ranft was startled to discover that he had pitched his tent in an ultrasonically noisy spot , where a bush cricket blasted away at high frequencies . Eventually , he succeeded at recording bat sounds between the cricket 's outbursts . <p> Despite the many tales illustrating the value of good strategies , Macaulay admits that sometimes " you just get lucky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a companion noticed a vocalization that none of the party recognized . Macaulay recorded it and played it back , hoping that the mystery bird would come investigate . Eventually a bird did arrive , behaving to Macaulay 's eyes like an animal checking out its own call . <p> Macaulay was thrilled . Here was a Whitehead 's trogon . Ornithologists had described the species ' appearance but had n't identified its vocalizations . The bird did n't call during its investigation , though , putting Macaulay in the maddening position of suspecting she 'd just made the first recording of a Whitehead 's trogon but not being able to prove it . She and her colleagues spent the next 4 hours tramping around the mountain slopes trying to catch sight of a trogon actually calling . Fortunately , they succeeded . <p> Making nature recordings has challenges that have nothing to do with birds , Macaulay says . On a trip to Haiti and the Dominican Republic during one of the periods of high tension between the two countries , she had to work her way through six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border . Birding has its own diplomatic powers . " Whenever there are police or roadblocks , you just get out the bird books and start pointing to pictures , " says Macaulay . <p> After a week of negotiating in Haiti and the Dominican Republic without mishap , she was startled to see a heavily armed man step into the road and block her way . " It turned out he had heard about us and wanted us come to his house and identify a bird , " Macaulay says . So , she accompanied the head of the army for the border region to his home , where she found a burrowing owl in his garden . <p> Recording is n't all about exotics on the edge of the world though . One of Macaulay 's one-of-a-kind treasures for Cornell came from a young great horned owl making an atypical sound she describes as " chattering hoots " literally in Macaulay 's back yard . And just last year , Budney realized that the Cornell library could use better recordings of pigeons , in part because they hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never enough . Any given species makes multiple sounds-calls for alarm , begging , staying in contact , mating , claiming territory , and so on . A good library needs both male and female versions of all those sounds , plus the squawks of developing youngsters . And then there 's geographic distribution . According to Budney , even 150,000 recordings are n't enough . <p> CHECK IT OUT Scientists use sound libraries for all kinds of projects . Ornithologist Douglas Nelson , the director of the recordings collections at the Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics at Ohio State University in Columbus , relies on recorded sounds for his studies of dialects in white-crowned sparrows . <p> Yes , he means dialects in much the same way the word applies to regional particularities in the way people talk . Nelson and his colleague Jill Soha are building on some 30 years of analysis of dialects in the Puget Sound subspecies of white-crowned sparrows . The late Luis Baptista began the project ( SN : 4/15/00 , p. 252 ) . Nelson and Soha can now identify about 10 different dialects along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dialects differ mostly in the way birds perform the final trill of their song . Some versions show up only in a small pocket of land , such as within 30 kilometers of Port Angeles , Wash. , but others can spread over hundreds of kilometers of coast . <p> " Once you get the hang of it , you can tell where you are by listening to the white-crowned sparrows , " says Nelson . <p> For birds that are born with their songs-as opposed to learning them from a parent-recordings offer researchers a way to look for genetic differences that might distinguish species . Ned K. Johnson of University of California , Berkeley , for example , has analyzed recordings of western flycatchers . He found two consistent song types that , with other evidence , indicate that the bird should be considered two different species . <p> Tape recorders became the conservation biologists ' best friend during a 1990s push to catalog birds and other animals in tropical forests about to be cleared . The late superstar of bird recordings , ornithologist and conservation guide Theodore A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd detected 243 species in a 2-square-kilometer area . Simultaneously , seven other ornithologists who relied on catching birds in a fine net required 54 days to document 287 species . <p> Ranft describes a more specialized form of census . In the early 1990s , conservationists feared that far fewer than a hundred Eurasian bitterns survived in the wild in Britain . But survey teams were having great trouble getting a good count of the birds , which usually slip silently among reeds in wetlands . By recording and analyzing males ' booming courtship calls , however , the surveyors were able to identify voices of particular males . Surveyors realized that earlier work had counted some males twice , not realizing that a male will travel several kilometers to try his luck again . New estimates set the number of males at around nine . <p> Despite Budney 's wincing moments in certain movies , he 's worked quite happily with several sound specialists in the entertainment industry , often on projects that have little to do with understanding wildlife . Sound designer Alan Splet called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library could provide that would evoke fall at a New England private school . Budney supplied the calls of black-capped chickadees assembling in their winter flocks , raucous brays from blue jays , and the honks of migrating Canada geese . <p> On several occasions , Budney has supplied nature recordings to Gary Rydstrom of Skywalker Sound in Nicasia , Calif. , who teased the originals into such novel forms that even Budney could n't pick them out . In Artificial Intelligence , Rydstrom manipulated woodpecker recordings to make the motor sounds of a robotic teddy bear . In the futuristic cop thriller Minority Report , he added to the unsettling atmosphere of police workstations with bits of recordings of midshipman fish . <p> There 's a long tradition of juicing up inanimate sounds by mixing in a few animal calls , he says . " You put a lion roar into a crashing wave , " Rydstrom says , and make an explosion sound more interesting by adding a cougar growl . In the movie Backdraft , which was about fighting fires , Budney enhanced the ominous effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of a coyote howl . One of the classic examples of such sound enhancement , he says , comes from the first three Star Wars movies , in which fighter aircraft screech with a modified camel 's call . <p> Ranft says his library , too , gets plenty of requests beyond the bounds of science . Birdcalls are becoming increasingly popular for cell-phone rings , and psychologists ask him for recordings of wasps and bees to use when people undergo therapy for insect phobias . Ranft has also supplied wasp recordings for treating a phobic dog . <p> Like librarians everywhere , Budney gets requests that do n't fit into any category . He 's no longer thrown by people begging him to send someone over immediately to record Sasquatch . Years of experience with " raspy screechings late at night , " usually from midsummer until November , lead him to inquire whether the caller knows the sound of a juvenile great horned owl being weaned . <p> However , Budney says he did enjoy the challenge of a series of phone calls , starting with one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . " When the third person called the library , Budney responded that someone in the household must recently have acquired a particular model of watch from Radio Shack . " The fellow was absolutely incredulous , " Budney recalls . <p> At some settings that model 's alarm went off on a default schedule with the oversimplified , hard-to-recognize sound of a rooster . The sound moved around the house because people had left the watch in different places on different days . <p> Rogue watch alarms aside , people can invent remarkable artificial sounds . However , even Rydstrom , a master of designing artificial universes , says , " I do n't think we can synthesize as interesting a sound with computers as the ones the natural world can create .
