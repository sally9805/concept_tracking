<p> NEW YORK  --  One fact is indisputable after Steve Case acknowledged the anger of shareholders by announcing Sunday his decision to resign in May as chairman of AOL Time Warner : <p> The Internet media visionaries of the late 1990s just did n't get it . <p> Case and other fallen digital dreamers  --  including former AOL Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin , former Vivendi Universal CEO Jean-Marie Messier and former Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Middelhoff  --  clearly misjudged how fast Internet media would catch on and how much revenue it would generate . <p> But the downfall of the Web 's most prominent evangelist raises another , more intriguing , question : Are he and his colleagues simply the victims of bad timing and market karma ? Or were they lousy executives who , at the height of the Internet frenzy , lost sight of fundamental characteristics of business and human nature ? <p> Case clearly believes that short-term circumstances beyond his control account for the 80% decline in the value of AOL stock in the three years since he announced its acquisition of media giant Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales would fall at America Online , how much subscription growth would slow and how interested federal investigators would become in its accounting practices . That made him an albatross at AOL , according to the company 's mightiest investors , including Vice Chairman Ted Turner , Capital Research &; Management 's Gordon Crawford and Liberty Media 's John Malone . <p> They and others are so angry that it appears to be just a matter of time before CEO Richard Parsons and the board decide to strip " AOL " from the company name . <p> Yet Case says time is on his side . <p> " Despite the current cynical view on Wall Street , there is growing evidence on Main Street that consumers increasingly desire and demand more choice , convenience and control from the media they consume , " Case said Sunday . " I will continue to advocate a forward-looking view , so that when the environment and our performance improve , our company will be well positioned to benefit from these trends . " <p> In a TV appearance Monday , he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think people will look back and have a different view on this merger . " <p> He 's not the only one who clings to the dream . Case and Levin " were extremely visionary and in the end will be vindicated for being correct , " says Tim Bajarin , president of consulting company Creative Strategies . <p> But others say that the Internet bubble was inflated more by hot egos than by cool logic . <p> " In light of the huge valuations of their companies two or three years ago , these men cast huge shadows , and they believed their legends , " says Brian Arthur , an economist at the Santa Fe Institute , a non-profit research and education center . " After the Internet collapse , they 've been revealed as just normal executives  --  some bright , some not . And many have been forced to slink away from the huge challenges they set themselves . " <p> Sony Corp . of America CEO Howard Stringer says , " The frenzy was quite blinding , and if you were n't in it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business executives was , ' You 're missing the boat . ' Society favored those who could n't wait to do deals . And when one ( Internet ) person can say , ' I 'm worth $ 100 million , ' that was irrefutable for a while . That enhanced the gold rush . It was greed run rampant . " <p> That skewed the way many approached basic business considerations . For example : <p> * Executives failed to realize how few synergies they 'd find between online and traditional media . <p> That was one of the most dazzling rationales AOL and Time Warner gave for their union . Case and Levin said that they could boost revenue by persuading advertisers to pay up for package deals . The assumption was that they 'd relish the opportunity to see their spots run across AOL Time Warner 's broadcast and cable channels ( including WB , CNN , TNT and TBS ) , in magazines ( including Time , People and Sports Illustrated ) and in AOL banner ads . <p> But that 's not the way ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick the venues that appeal to their target audiences , says David Simons , managing director at Digital Video Investments . <p> To make matters worse , AOL executives never could figure out how different divisions would benefit by working together . For instance , Time Warner Cable honchos knew that their successful high-speed Internet access service , Road Runner , might suffer if they also pushed AOL Broadband  --  where they 'd have to share the proceeds . <p> " You can smooth these things over but never eliminate them , " Simons says . As a result , companies " hoped for synergies that did not happen . " <p> * Executives panicked into moving too quickly . <p> Many companies decided they had to do something , anything , to catch the seemingly speeding Internet train . They " saw a few early successes , like Amazon.com , and thought they needed to rush in , " says Christopher Ely , vice president and portfolio manager at investment management firm Loomis Sayles . <p> It was n't just that they 'd miss out on a good thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that if you do n't have a substantial presence in new media , you 'd be left out in the game of musical chairs , " says Joseph Turow , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania 's Annenberg School for Communication . <p> Many companies acted first and asked questions later . <p> Where were the voices of reason on Wall Street ? <p> " These business were being put together so quickly , it was very hard for analysts to get their arms around the numbers , " says UBS Warburg 's Christopher Dixon . " Where we stand today , we are digesting the excesses of the past several years . " <p> * Media giants overestimated how fast cable and phone companies would roll out broadband . <p> Moguls could n't do much without the broadband speed needed for high-fidelity music and video . <p> " Broadband was the missing link , " Ely says . " To capture people 's attention , you have to provide an experience that will hold their attention , " he says . " If you want to surf Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial-up . Life 's too short . " <p> But broadband providers consistently promised more than they could deliver . <p> Stringer saw that in the mid-1990s when he ran Tele-TV , a failed phone company alliance with Hollywood that was supposed to deliver video . <p> " At Tele-TV , I thought DSL ( digital subscriber lines ) would be ubiquitous , " he says . " But seven years later , it is n't , and cable has the most capacity to deliver broadband . " <p> * They overestimated how much consumers would pay for new services . <p> The theory was that people who used free Internet services would become hooked  --  and then gladly buy subscriptions to keep getting the content . <p> That 's not how things turned out . Media companies discovered that the cost for making content was much higher than they expected . With just a few exceptions , " Being able to charge for online content has been difficult , " says Paul Cook , portfolio manager at Munder Capital Management . <p> Consumers stubbornly continued to buy music and rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month or more for broadband to download the entertainment . <p> In the meantime , many grew accustomed to getting material for free . Deep changes in the industry are needed to overcome that mindset . <p> Small upstarts that still give away free content need to burn through their venture-capital funds , Cook says . Then large media companies will be able to charge for their content . <p> In addition , large media need to bundle their content into packages that Internet service providers can offer for an extra fee  --  similar to premium cable channels such as HBO , Showtime and Starz . <p> * Executives misjudged investors ' willingness to support unprofitable companies . <p> " There was an assumption you could sell stock to the public and fund your way through anything , " says Marta Wohrle , vice president of the media consultancy at Mercer Management Consulting . Moguls thought " they could invest their way to being the last man standing . " <p> It did n't take long before most media firms launched Internet tracking stocks , such as Disney 's Disney Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shut out of the equity market after the Internet bubble burst . <p> Shares of NBC Internet and Disney Internet Group plunged before their parents finally called them back in . Viacom could n't even get its initial public offering of MTVi done . " The marketplace let the valuations get out of hand , " says Bob Davis , former CEO of Internet portal Lycos who is now a venture partner . " They were astronomical . " <p> Executives contributed to that by forecasting extraordinarily high earnings . AOL Time Warner shareholders felt especially betrayed by the company 's refusal in 2001 to acknowledge that it had gotten carried away . Investors finally concluded that AOL and Time Warner had paid " too high a price for something that was too uncertain , " says Sanford C. Bernstein 's Tom Wolzien . <p> It will probably take another year or two before the market can determine whether the Internet champions were visionaries or delusional . But that 's cold comfort for those left with devastating losses . <p> " In the long run , they 'll be proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former CEO of Viacom and Universal . " But in the long run , we 're all dead . " <p>  --  <p> Contributing : Paul Davidson , Matt Krantz , Jon Swartz
