The recession  --  if indeed we had one  --  appears to have ended in the first quarter , yet unemployment remains stalled at 6% , close to its eight-year high . The economy is growing , but the stock market is n't . The bubble in tech stocks has popped , but some are worried another is swelling in the housing market . It 's been that kind of economy , where each hopeful portent comes wrapped in anxiety . <P> A catchphrase for the times is jobless recovery : national income is rising , but employment is not . That 's not unusual immediately after a recession . Businesses are typically quicker to lay off workers than to hire them back . But sometimes , as in the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession , the economy grows for months without a significant boost to payrolls . The statistics say one thing ; people killing time in the unemployment line say another . <P> With 1.8 million net jobs lost in 2001 and little improvement in the unemployment rate so far this year , are we heading toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME posed to its Board of Economists . " It will feel like a jobless recovery largely because our point of reference is the boom years of the ' 90s , when unemployment went all the way down to 3.9% , " says Nariman Behravesh , chief economist for the consulting firm DRI-WEFA . " When it is up around 6% , it feels a lot worse . " <P> Our four other panelists were Ken Goldstein , labor economist for the Conference Board ; Sung Won Sohn , chief economist for Wells Fargo Banks in Minneapolis , Minn. ; William Spriggs , director of the National Urban League 's Institute of Opportunity and Equality ; and Diane Swonk , chief economist for Bank One in Chicago . They all agreed that job growth will remain anemic this year , with unemployment hovering around 5.6% to 5.8% and falling slowly even as other economic indicators regain strength . Our panel expects payroll growth to rise from 50,000 in July to , optimistically , 125,000 by December  --  compared with 400,000 a month during the 1990s boom . <P> What makes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slump and continues to be strong in the recovery . In every other postwar recession and in the early part of most recoveries , productivity slumped because production dropped faster than employment . This time , companies were quick to shed workers and have been slow to hire them back . Those who have jobs are working harder and more efficiently , with better technology . Productivity , or output per worker , rose 8.3% in the first quarter and 5.5% the quarter before that . <P> TIME : How significant are productivity gains to the shape of this recovery ? <P> SOHN : I view productivity as the linchpin driving this economy . Economic growth comes from two sources : No. 1 is labor hours ; the other is productivity . <P> BEHRAVESH : One of the unusual things about productivity in this whole cycle is that it continued to rise during the expansion , whereas in the normal cycle , it tends to tail off at the end of the expansion . This time it actually accelerated during the expansion .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
