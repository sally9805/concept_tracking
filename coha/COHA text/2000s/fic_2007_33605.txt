1 SANTIAGO EFFORTLESSLY avoided a lunging tackle and closed on the goal . The Newcastle faithful , a sea of black and white on all four sides of St. James ' Park , roared their approval as Santiago brushed off a second challenge . His eyes lifted for a split second and his brain made the instinctive and instant , computer-like calculation : range , trajectory , power . And then , with hardly a break in stride , Santiago struck a perfectly weighted and flighted ball past the despairing dive of the keeper into the top corner of the net . The crowd erupted , joyously celebrating what was to be voted the Premiership goal of the season as Santiago raised both arms to the sky in acknowledgment of their adulation . The fans ' roars thundered around the stadium , into the city streets , and down to the River Tyne . And as Santiago stood , arms raised , the echoes of those cheers could be heard across Europe in a darkened room at the very heart of Spain . A group of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen image on a huge plasma screen . They spoke softly , almost conspiratorially , in Spanish , as if they were afraid that unwanted listeners might overhear their words . The electronic shutters on the windows slowly began to open and daylight spilled into the screening room , revealing a desktop clutteredwith photographs , sheets of statistics , videocassettes , biographical notes , everything dedicated to the life and football career of one young man : Santiago Muez . The man at the center of the group turned to one of his colleagues . " Harris and Muez played well together at Newcastle ; maybe they would be good together here . " " Buy they play in the same position now , " came the instant reply . He nodded toward the plasma screen and within seconds the Muez highlights reel was rolling again , cutting to a different match and a bustling run by Santiago that ended in another spectacular goal . " Exactly , " said the first man . Santiago had grown to love Newcastle and its people , who had adopted him as an honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . It was a long way from his Mexican roots and just as distant from the run-down district of Los Angeles in California where he had grown up and developed his natural skills as a soccer player . He would , almost certainly , have still been playing local league soccer , as they called it back home , had it not been for a chance encounter with Glen Foy . Glen , an ex-Newcastle player himself and a onetime scout for the club , was on vacation in L.A. when he saw Santiago playing in a park match . He knew instantly he was watching someone special , someone blessed with footballing gifts granted to very few . Against all the odds , Glen arranged a trial with Newcastle for Santiago , and what followed had since become part of the folklore of the famous Tyneside club . Sometimes , even after a season and a half , it still seemed like a dream to Santiago -- a dream come true . He missed the sunshine of L.A. and he missed his grandmother , Mercedes , and his younger brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , the top-of-the-line BMW , the beautiful new home . And then , of course , there was Roz . Roz was a nurse ; they had met soon after Santiago arrived in Newcastle , and little more than a year later , they were planning their wedding . Life was wonderful . It could hardly get better . Santiago had moved swiftly from park player to St. James ' Park hero . Fans of Newcastle United , collectively known as the Toon Army , knew he was a great , natural goal scorer , and many of the faithful predicted that someday he would challenge the scoring feats of even the legends , Jackie Milburn and Alan Shearer . But , of course , that depended on the club being able to hang on to a player now regarded as one of the hottest properties in football .
