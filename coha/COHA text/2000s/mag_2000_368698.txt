John McCain would n't give him much face time , so Wallace , in this narrative , available only as an e-book , tries to make a virtue of exile by telling the story of the Senator 's failed presidential bid from the perspective of the TV crews and others on the overflow buses . But the mash note to his fellow riders turns to wholesale gush as he pants over their observations , the banal as well as the smart , reminding us that this is Wallace 's first up-close look at a campaign . Worse , some details are made up , tainting the sharp insights he does offer . <P>  --  By John Dickerson
