Kathleen lay on the massage table and looked up at the casement windows high above her . The sashes were fashioned of rough oak , the glass uneven and bottle-thick . Propped open on green sapling sticks , they were windows from an enchanted castle . Having been a children 's librarian for twenty-five years , Kathleen Levine considered herself something of an expert on the subject of enchanted castles . She smiled and closed her eyes . The massage was a birthday present from her coworkers at Edison Elementary . They 'd given her the gift certificate at a surprise party for her fifty-ninth birthday , almost five months ago . When Madge Feeney , the school secretary , had learned that Kathleen still had n't used it , Madge had harrumphed and made the appointment for her . Kathleen stretched her neck from side to side . " Comfortable ? " asked Marla , who stood at the far end of the table , kneading Kathleen 's left instep . Marla Fletcher , who was nearly six feet tall , sounded as though she were far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle of " Jack and the Beanstalk , " Kathleen thought , and smiled again . She sighed , letting go of the tension of driving from school to this odd , out-of-the-way place . Kathleen had thought she knew every last side street on Cape Ann , but Marla 's directions had taken her along unfamiliar roads leading , finally , up a rutted , one-way lane that looped around the steep hills overlooking Mill Pond . She nearly turned back once , convinced she 'd lost the way . But then she spotted the landmark : a stone gate , half-hidden by overgrown lilac bushes , weeks away from blooming . It must have been a stunning estate in its day . Much as she hated being late , Kathleen slowed down for a better look . The great lawn had been designed to show off the pond , which shone platinum in the spring sun . Beyond it , Mill River glittered into the distance , silver on mauve . She turned the car toward the sprawling hewn-granite mansion . Those windows seemed piteously small to be facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four smaller outbuildings , made of the same majestic stones , with the same slate turrets , seemed oddly grand for servants ' quarters . Kathleen drove past two young couples in tennis whites standing by the net on a pristine clay court . They turned to watch as she pulled up beside the round stone tower , where Marla waited by the door . Rapunzel , thought Kathleen , at the sight of her waist-length golden hair . Lying on the massage table , Kathleen wondered whether she could translate this amazing place into " once upon a time . " She had tried to write children 's books , she had even taken classes . But that was not her gift . Kathleen was good at matching children to books . She could find just the right story to catch any child 's imagination even the wildest boys , who were her pet projects , her special successes . It was n't as grand a gift as writing , but it was a gift . And in her own private way , Kathleen was proud of it . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill in the woods , stroked and kneaded like a happy lump of dough by a kind lady ; it seemed like an engraved invitation . Was this the kind of scene that had inspired Charles Dodgson to become Lewis Carroll ? Was this the world that Maurice Sendak visited whenever he set out on a new book ? " Time to turn over , " Marla said , draping the sheet so Kathleen remained covered . Warm oil trickled over Kathleen 's sloping shoulders , velvet drops that soothed and tickled . " Nice , " she said , overcome by gratitude to this pleasant stranger who made her feel so well cared for , so ... cradled . Curious word , Kathleen thought . Curiouser and curiouser . She closed her eyes . The next thing she knew , two warm hands cupped her face . " Take your time getting dressed , " Marla whispered . " I 'm going to get you a glass of water . " But Kathleen was no dawdler . She saw from the clock beside her that nearly two hours had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the edge of the table and reached for her bra , fastening the hooks in front , bottom to top , just as her sister had shown her when Kathleen was twelve years old , before she needed a bra at all . She had no idea she was weeping until Marla raced back up the winding stone staircase , an empty glass in her hand . Kathleen tried to regain control of her breathing . " I have breast cancer , " she said , staring down at her chest . " Oh my God , " Marla said softly . She sat down and took Kathleen 's hand . " I wish you 'd told me . I would have brought up my amethyst crystal . I could have burned myrrh instead of sage . " Kathleen sniffed and stifled a laugh . " That 's okay . It was a wonderful massage . " " Do you want to make an appointment for another one ? That might be a good thing to do . " Kathleen wiped her nose on her slippery forearm and turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one , and then the traitor . " I 'll call you after I know when ... After ... " Her throat closed . Marla put an arm around her shoulders . The only sound was the volley on the tennis court below . The juicy pop of ball hitting racket , court , racket , sounded back and forth for a long time before someone finally missed a shot . The players ' laughter filtered up through the windows , like an echo from another day , another story .
