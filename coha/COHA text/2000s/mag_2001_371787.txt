The 12 bearded soldiers making their way up a pass in the White Mountains of Tora Bora were decked out in flat-topped Afghan caps and flowing shalwar kameezes . From a distance only one detail gave them away as Americans . Afghan alliance fighters  --  dedicated but largely untrained  --  walk upright , making themselves easy targets for enemy fire . The Americans were shimmying up the hill on their bellies . <P> Late last week American special operations forces quietly made their way to Tora Bora , to the very front of the front lines . The dozen U.S. soldiers used a translator to coordinate with an Afghan commander . To the Afghan fighters at their side , the Americans made it clear they were on a search-and-destroy mission . " We and the Americans had the same goal , " said Khawri , an Afghan who was shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. troops . " To kill all the al-Qaeda people . " By Sunday , the Afghans were claiming victory , though the U.S. remained guarded . <P> The war in Afghanistan began nine weeks ago on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end in a high , narrow valley smaller than the city of Austin . After weeks of playing Where 's Osama ? , military officials believe they have overheard bin Laden on handheld radio in the White Mountains , giving orders to his dwindling al-Qaeda forces . Afghan fighters said they had killed 200 and routed al-Qaeda but the U.S. said too many nooks had yet to be searched . If bin Laden is in Tora Bora , he and his soldiers are trapped in a box : snow-covered peaks loom on two sides , Afghan and American soldiers await on a third , and Pakistani border patrols stand guard on the fourth . <P> The cornered fighters have little room to maneuver . With no enemy anti-aircraft fire , U.S. spy planes circle the sky , daring al-Qaeda fighters to step out of their caves and become glowing infrared targets . Few have done so . Bin Laden has resorted to giving orders on shortwave radio , U.S. authorities suggest , because there 's no one else left to do so . <P> But inevitability almost slipped away last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the week with a successful assault on the Milawa Valley , the lone entrance to Tora Bora from the north . Al-Qaeda soldiers fled quickly , though they did manage to kill a few alliance troops . Having taken the territory , the warlords committed a major tactical error : they withdrew from the valley . When alliance forces returned the next day , they were greeted by three al-Qaeda fighters armed with machine guns who opened fire from 200 meters . No alliance soldiers were killed , but the morning was spent fighting a battle for territory that had already been won . <P> The follies had only just begun . As al-Qaeda fighters scampered up the mountains in search of safe haven , one of the warlords , Haji Zaman , agreed to a cease-fire without bothering to consult the other two Afghan commanders or the U.S. Zaman claims the Arab-speaking fighters reached him via wireless and offered to surrender on the condition that they be turned over to the United Nations . " They said they had to get in contact with each other and would surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the cease-fire , halted his troops ' advance and gave the opposition until 8 a.m. to give themselves up .
