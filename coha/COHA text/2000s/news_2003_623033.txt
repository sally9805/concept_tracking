<p> They realize they 're gambling , or they just try not to think about it . <p> They are among the 74.7 million Americans under 65 , or about 30 percent of the population in this age bracket , who had no health insurance for some or all of 2001 and 2002 , according to a new survey . <p> In California , 11.1 million people were uninsured during that period , a reflection of high unemployment and the growing number of immigrants in the state . That accounted for 35.5 percent of the state 's non-elderly population and is more than any other state . <p> " We tend to stereotype people who do n't have benefits . Many people say they 're not deserving , they 're loafers , " said Dr. Steven A. Schroeder , professor of health care and health policy at UCSF and former president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , which released the survey and sponsored last week 's Cover the Uninsured Week . <p> Schroeder said he hopes to dispel that myth . According to the survey , 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers do not offer health insurance , and many more are expected to drop coverage or to require increased employee contributions to the plans as the double-digit premium increases continue . <p> Adding to the ranks of the uninsured is the growing number of laid-off workers . Those eligible to remain covered under their employer 's plan often can not afford it . And , when the company goes bankrupt , like many of the dot-coms , such a plan is not an option . <p> For many , finding individual health insurance on the open market is just too expensive or difficult due to such factors as a pre-existing condition . New plans with low monthly premiums have cropped up to fill the gap , but they carry deductibles as high as $5,000 . <p> With rising unemployment , increasing premiums and diminishing retiree benefits , the numbers of uninsured are expected to rise , putting an increasing burden on the already strained health care system . <p> Here are three stories that put a face on the uninsured with some of the issues and some of the difficult choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monterrosa Serres lost her job as an apartment manager in September , she lost her family 's health care along with it . <p> The 36-year-old mother , who lives with her husband , 19-month-old daughter and 5-year-old son , was let go after her former management firm came under new ownership . <p> The layoff also cost her their apartment because it was a benefit of her former job . <p> She found a new apartment management job , along with a new , rent-free home , but the deal did n't include health insurance . Serres ' husband , who is self-employed in the computer industry , has had difficulty finding clients or getting another job . <p> " It 's very frustrating and very scary , and we just do it one day at a time . The main thing I worry about is not just illness , but accidents , " said Serres , who has never been without health insurance before and is well aware of the potential disasters two small children can get into . <p> At a salary of $1,600 a month , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' income is just high enough that they have not qualified for a state program such as Medi-Cal or Healthy Families . <p> Her 19-month-old has already missed her well-baby appointment , which is usually scheduled at 18 months of age . Serres is willing to pay the $750 for the appointment and vaccinations , but she does n't have the money up front , and the doctor 's office balked at allowing her to pay in installments . <p> She 's managed to take care of her own health needs through Planned Parenthood and is on the waiting list for a low-income clinic to take care of the kids . <p> " I 'm just holding my breath . I try not to worry , " Serres said . " But when they get a little sniffly , I 'm always worried if this is going to turn into an ear infection or an asthma attack . " <p> SELF-EMPLOYED , UNINSURED <p> Rob Blackwelder is what the health insurance industry likes to call the " young and immortal . " <p> He 's 33 , single and pursuing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be emotionally fulfilling but not financially rewarding . <p> Some people in the " young and immortal " category make a conscious choice not to buy insurance because they would rather spend the money on other things . <p> Blackwelder , who 's $28,000 in debt , is not one of them . He simply ca n't afford it . <p> " I 'm sort of maintaining that sort of youthful delusion of invincibility . But I 'm at a point when I 'm starting to realize that notion is not the truth , " said Blackwelder , who sells his articles through his own syndication service called Splicedwire . <p> Blackwelder , who is lucky enough to have nothing more than allergies and a popping knee , says his cash-flow problem makes it infeasible for him to buy even one of those low-premium , high-deductible plans that cover only catastrophic illness or accidents . <p> He works 70 hours a week but relies on savings , loans and credit cards to make ends meet . The monthly rent for his one-bedroom apartment in Oakland 's Adams Point neighborhood is $735 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The choice Blackwelder has is to get a job that offers health insurance , but he 's not ready to give up on his dream of becoming a financially stable film critic despite the tough economic climate . <p> " I 'm so addicted to what I 'm doing . I really do n't want to do anything else , " he said . " I will get some insurance when I 'm stable . If I ever need insurance , I hope it 's not going to be until I have it . " <p> Until then , he tries not to think about it . <p> " When I worry about it the most is when I 'm just going to the doctor for a visit , " said Blackwelder , who has n't had insurance since 1998 and pays out of pocket for each visit . " What I tend to do is wait until I have at least three things wrong with me . " <p> UNINSURED BY CHOICE <p> Valerie Lathrop has consciously decided not to have health insurance . She does n't want to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care she believes in . <p> The 59-year-old Orinda resident spends about $300 a month on natural supplements , flower essences , homeopathic remedies , acupuncture , chiropractic visits and healers  --  the remedies and services she says make and keep her healthy . <p> What really upsets her is the recent introduction of several state bills that propose lowering the ranks of the uninsured by requiring everyone to have health insurance either through employers or a state program . <p> To Lathrop , that 's like mandating whether or not she can breathe . <p> " I ca n't drive if I do n't have auto insurance . Am I not allowed to be allowed to work if I do n't have health insurance ? Am I not going to be allowed to have children ? , " she said . <p> It also goes against how she looks at life . " I could walk out and have a piano drop on me tomorrow , but I work consciously and consistently to evolve so I do n't attract and participate in that kind of violence , " Lathrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit on the fringe . She 's a practitioner of bio-energy balancing , which she describes as a form of muscle testing that unblocks energy and promotes healing . <p> Lathrop said she 's not against health insurance . She would support a universal plan that offered what she wants . But she opposes compulsory insurance for what she calls only " half of the pie , " which is just standard Western medicine . <p> It 's not about money . While she wo n't say how much she and her husband make , she said they make a healthy income running their own business that builds and rents homes . <p> She realizes her choice means she could be financially wiped out if she or her 72-year-old husband ( who is on Medicare ) were to suffer a catastrophic illness or accident . She also believes people create the environment that allows for their own illnesses and accidents . <p> CHART : Coping in Californiawithout health care insurance A statistical profile of the uninsured under 65 TIME UNINSURED DURING 2001-02 1 to 2 months - 9.1% 3 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 to 12 months - 10.2% 13 to 23 months - 19.5% 24 months - 25.0% EMPLOYMENT STATUS Employed ( full or part time ) - 69.6% Not in labor force - 22.6% Unemployed - 7.7% FAMILY INCOME - Relative to federal poverty level 200% of poverty level or less - 46.3% More than 200% of poverty level - 53.7% SEX Male - 51.6% Female - 48.4% AGE 0 to 10 years - 17.1% 11 to 17 years - 11.2% 18 to 34 years - 40.3% 35-64 years - 31.3% RACE AND ETHNIC ORIGIN Hispanic - 53.3% White , non-Hispanic - 28.4% Black , non-Hispanic 5.7% Other - 12.6% <p> .
