" One of my secret pleasures in this game of ours , " Bob Thurston confesses , " is to open a publication with something of mine in it and read the header . " With that pressure on us , our editorial team set to work and discovered that Robert Thurston played the maitre d " in I Still Dream of Jeannie and Zack Miller in the 1926 film Stacked Cards ; is a Research Assistant in the Botany Department in the University of Wyoming ( Laramie ) ; was born 25 Feb. 1713 in Stratham , Rockingham ( the son of Mary Knight and Steven Thurston ) ; is a local councillor for Netteswell ward in Essex ; donated his papers ( including correspondence with Cy McCormick and Nik Tesla ) to Cornell University 's Carl A. Kroch Library ; and was a musicologist who died in 1971 . The internet has certainly changed our lives . Which leads in nicely to this story , a look at the near future and the nature of change . Bob Thurston ( our Bob Thurston ) says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and feelings about the field that this story explores . <p> 1 . EVEN THOUGH I WAS typically not packed , even though typically I 'd mislaid my Civilian Travel Documents , even though Generalissimo Belford was barking at me to get on the stick , even though the chopper was waiting to take me off the island , I had to first say goodbye to my favorite aliens , Minnie and Zip Drive . My Favorite Aliens - maybe I can turn this all into a TV sitcom and make some money for once in my damn life . Because there had been some new mischief from my beloved charges , I had to be escorted around the island by one of our military contingent . This time I drew the one guy who refused to believe that my rejection of his attentions was honest and final . His name was Miguel Santiago , and he insisted on being called Miguel over Mike , although most of us called him Mike anyway . " Hows about it , Yesenia , " he said . " Your barracks or mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " I do n't have barracks . I 'm a civilian . I get a real room , Mike . " " Tell me the time and I 'll bring flowers . " " Dump your wish list , soldier . " Santiago was a thin , dusky-skinned man with - against military regulations - a very thin moustache and elongated sideburns . I thought it was curious that he even wanted to look like a Mexican bandit . Next thing I knew , he 'd be telling me he did n't need no stinking badges . I found Minnie and Zip Drive near the northeast end of the island , moving their thick bodies in that graceful side-to-side sway and looking out to sea , toward the place where their spaceship lay submerged . So idyllic , I thought at the time in that dreadful ironic way I have n't been able to shake since I was a pretentious college student . But they did look like a photo shoot for a book on - I do n't know - on Rousseau . The Noble Savages from Outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking it . Hardly savages , and not so noble either . All the Loshaks painfully jabbed at any human who got too close to them . Since there were twentyseven of them , that was a lot of pain , a lot of incidents , a bunch of Loshakmade scars for our peaceful military guardians . The latest incident , the one that had required my escort , had involved one of the Loshaks , Zip maybe , or the furiously mischievous Macro , roughly tripping up one of the sergeants , then sitting on him . When something like this happened , our noble warriors cursed us for putting so many restrictions on retaliation . Even in those times when regs had been ignored and a guard tried to nail a Loshak with a stun gun pellet , the target could spring out of the way like a kung fu specialist . I gestured Santiago away and watched him amble toward the nearby tree where the soldiers assigned to guard Minnie and Zip Drive leaned against fragile-looking trees or sat on the rocky ground , chatting , probably concocting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does a Loshak pick its nose variety , and I hated them . The soldiers resented me because I was forever telling them that they were tools of the government whose flag they displayed in oversized shoulder patches . I suspect that the anonymous emails , routed through unknown sources , that accused me of alien-worshipping treason , came from them . I momentarily wondered if Santiago really thought he could seduce me . If he touched me , I 'd either cut his throat or set fire to his sideburns . After he had reached his compatriots , I could see from the way his body gestured back toward me that he was bitching about me . With relief , I returned my attention to my favorite aliens . I gestured hello , a kind of jutting out of one elbow while shaking my head side to side . This was only one of the forty or so kinetic units of communication I 'd been able to establish in my three years as the linguistics specialist on the island . In some ways the choreographic content of the communication made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been sure whether the units represented units of the Loshaks " own language patterns or merely ones that they let us make up for the rudimentary communication they needed with us , a kind of joke they could share in scorning us . Minnie responded to my gesture while Zip Drive , characteristically , paid little attention . I looked at Minnie and thought again of how lousy we were with names . Their computer names , concocted by our computer geeks , did n't even make sense , any more than their calling the species Loshaks , a term whose origin I had never been able to track down . The word made them sound like some exiled Slavic family rather than aliens from space stranded on our planet . And the whole gender differentiation of the names was crap . There was n't any indication , for example , that Minnie ( short for Minibyte ) was male or female or even one of several sexes we could n't comprehend . Nobody had detected any sexual differentiation among the Loshaks . Once they gave them names , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even I called Minnie " old girl . " Minnie at that moment looked almost human as she fingered , with narrow long digits that seemed to wheel out from her hand , the silver identification tag that hung on a chain from her very thin neck . Almost all the Loshaks ignored the LD. tags , but Minnie had a habit of fidgeting with hers . Beneath a face that could be imagined as humanoid , although their heads actually looked like pitted and jagged rocks with nothing resembling a nose , there was a rounded ill-defined body with limbs that emerged and retracted according to need . In repose a Loshak looked pretty much like an unevenly shaped head atop a pillow that had lost its shape . We did n't have a clue about how many limbs an individual Loshak had . The guys had tried surreptitious electronic scans , but the Loshaks responded with their usual jamming , a mysterious effect that seemed to come more from their minds than any device we could detect . Some of us thought that the shapes they took on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds and discovered our irrational affection for household pets , and so had restructured themselves to look cuddly and less threatening . They did not completely scale down the threatening part , but it was easier to regard them through our teddy bear eyes . Sometimes Loshaks emerged from their drafty government-issue Quonset huts carrying jerrybuilt contraptions and walked into the sea . When they descended to the ocean floor , our scanners showed that their bodies became elongated and thin . They glided in spite of the high pressure at that depth . If I had half their grace , I 'd have been the damn ballerina my mom wanted me to be . They took the contraptions to the spaceship , stayed awhile , then came back empty-handed . Most of us figured they were either storing the materials or using them to repair whatever was broken there , though how such assemblages of junk could be used for anything was baffling . " What 's new with you , old girl ? " I asked Minnie . Her gravelly sound meant something like , " nothing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag , forcing it to fly upward to the level of her face . " Something new for me , I 'm afraid , Minnie . I 'm going back stateside - to my country , that is . " Minnie stared at me , but Zip Drive whirled around and climbed a nearby tree . Zip was usually thought of as male because of his apparent bluff arrogance . He sat on a branch now and looked out to sea , pretending not to listen to Minnie and me . He had an almost pleasant expression on his face , which meant he was angry . Minnie looked irritable , a sign she was probably in a good mood . " You know what we mean by country ? " Minnie gave an abrupt grunt . I suspected they always understood more than they cared to show through their grunted and growled vocabulary . Their language seemed to be full of nuance . My training in paralanguage helped me to combine hand , arm , and leg gestures with my version of Loshak sounds to achieve some interaction with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions and perceive their metalinguistic signals . I had done a paper on how their faces displayed emotions opposite to humans , anger for happiness , joy for rage . When the government 's nondisclosure restrictions were rescinded , I planned to publish the paper and even write a book . " Well , old girl , I do n't really have a home in my country anymore , just relatives , friends , an ex-husband who explores caves and caverns and should remain in one forever-which would suit him , I think . See , people who control the money for this project are going to ask a lot of questions , and they 're going to complain that , since results have been limited , the money 's being wasted . That 's how government works , Minnie . The money shows , the project goes . And I 'll say , what the hell you gon na do with " em anyway . Take away the money and you guys 're still here and we retain enough human virtue not to do anything evil . I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the best representative to argue for the project . Says I 've achieved so much with you guys . That is bullshit , of course . Belford wants me to go there because I 'm attractive , in my dark and Latin way , and my hair has a natural wave that looks heroic for a representative of a team working with fearsome aliens in a desolate scientific environment . He wants me to lie , exaggerate the significance of our results , dazzle them with my charm , and - you know what ? - I will because I love it here and I love you guys and I do n't want this to end . Not ever . " As she listened , two of Minnie 's arms propped her up on the hillside while one straight limb , not looking much like a leg , anchored her . Reminded me of a cheesecake pose in a cheap magazine . Damn , I said to myself , why did God give me the kind of mind that would imagine Minnie as an alien centerfold ? Yet I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they picked up small rocks and carried them around . They hardly seemed conscious of them . After a while , though , they tossed them aside without noticing where they fell . Occasionally they sat back to back and made arrhythmic low noises . One team member thought this might be , at long last , Loshak sex . I did n't even like to speculate on Loshak sex . They say there 's a species of something on Earth , dwelling in the sea , microscopic , that never has sex and is female . Maybe this is the way God wanted all species to be . Zip Drive eased down off the tree branch and spoke to Minnie in a voice that resembled a volcano rumbling , all the while appearing to smile . Minnie responded in a series of cadenced utterances that contained almost human inflection . I strained to hear something I could recognize , translate , interpret . At something Minnie said Zip Drive took a couple of steps toward me . I looked to my right and saw Santiago begin to rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , seeming disappointed that he could n't use his martial expertise . Not that he could have done much . Still , he was allowed to down an alien with a tranquilizer bullet - something that had not yet happened , but warriors can dream , I guess . I probably misjudged Santiago and , for that matter , all the soldiers who guarded us . It must be hard on troops to guard a peaceful government installation instead of being off with real soldiers who were using their martial expertise . I wished they could go away , travel to more adventurous locations , but even I had to admit that we were pretty vulnerable to attack on Belford 's Island , should one of our foes suddenly decide we would make a sweet and meaningful target . Pro patria mori , I guess , though I had some reservations about that , too . Zip Drive , using three limbs , turned and raced briskly to the side of the cliff , his nametag swinging wildly from side to side . At cliffside he came to an abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It always surprised me , how fast Loshaks could move , and Zip was one of the speediest of them . Among the Loshaks there was one faster than Zip , a small compatriot incongruously named Broadband . Generally , Loshaks loped across the countryside on four legs , strolled on two or three . A single limb , which might emerge from anywhere on the rounded body , was used to pull vegetation out of a bowl and insert it into the lopsided orifice that served as a Loshak mouth . Lifting could engage as many as eight limbs , and they were strong as hell . With those eight limbs a Loshak could lift a truck and fling it several meters up a hillside - a practice that we had to persuade them to stop . While I could n't imagine our government abandoning the Loshaks , I still had unpleasant pictures of them scratching out an existence on the island . There was enough vegetation and the ocean would provide , but it would n't say much for humanity if we ignored them . And , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty nervous , not knowing what the Loshaks were up to on the island . These days we never knew what kind of prod anyone would use to start an uprising , so paranoid politicians all over the world worried about what kind of uprising the Loshaks might be capable of . The other futures that might be found for them were unpleasant . Zoos , traveling exhibitions , their own TV shows , sitcoms - I did n't even want to think about any of it . My own worst paranoid nightmare was of the CIA conducting one of their covert operations to make the aliens disappear forever . " So I do n't know what they 'll do . Not to worry , though . You guys are too important . " Zip Drive made a nervous wave toward the sea . I walked nearer to him and said , " What are you looking at , I wonder ? Your ship ? It is kind of wondrous , the sea , the waves , the horizon , even the boats that come up close to sneak a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me , in a daze and zoning out . Hey , Zip , give me a clue . Speak to me suddenly in my own language , in a British accent , with wonderful insights into life . Wo n't ? No , I could n't either , I were you . " Minnie came to my side and Zip took a couple of steps toward us . He growled and I must admit the sound seemed menacing , even though it was friendly . Santiago edged forward and shouted , asking me if I needed any help . I told him do n't be ridiculous and go somewhere and tell offensive jokes . Eventually Minnie and Zip Drive strode gracefully away , each on four limbs . Later , they stood almost shyly at the edge of a line of scrawny trees and watched the chopper take off . Except for the TV coverage , that was the last I saw of them . 2 . I entered the taxicab with the foul taste of bureaucracy in my mouth . I had spent hours with a stiff government employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivy League and nasal vowels . In a flat disinterested voice he asked me questions that clearly indicated his disapproval of the Belford 's Island project . I could tell he thought the money was wasted and that his belief reflected the litany of the damn bureaucrats I was scheduled to go up against tomorrow - that there were too many people in our country needing help . Our money should be diverted to improving the lives of the poor , the downtrodden . If not the poor , then trillions for defense , trillions for preemptive attack . All the crap that fueled politicians at election time and gave bureaucrats excuses for their lies . No matter what logical arguments I offered , he just sighed , ignored me , and went on to the next prepared question he retrieved from papers in a folder he held on his lap . Froman was a pudgy sort , chubby cheeks and a bureaucratic belly bulge . He looked like the villain-banker in an old movie serial , the kind I had watched with my father during the days we had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had rescued the set from a trash pile in the street . He liked to shout at the villains with some old-fashioned oldcountry curses that he refused to translate for me . I loved my father , mi papa . I missed him so much , even after seven years I could not think of him without immediate tears coming into my eyes . Froman sat stiffly , his body twisted slightly away from me and his legs thrust straight out and crossed , just one of the guys at ease in the frat house . He reminded me of some of the characters in reruns of The West Wing , so sure of their whitebread notions , good-mouthing inclusion while holding on to power . In spite of Froman 's apparent indifference to me , there were times when he stole quick glances my way - generally checking out my chest but occasionally sweeping across my face . I twisted my own body around , figuring the view might improve my chances of success with the committee . In the one time he relaxed , he put his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my last views of Zip Drive . " How did you even know he was sad to see you go ? " " Not sure exactly . Since he appeared kind of happy , I suppose he was actually sad to see me go . " " I 'm surprised you even distinguish facial expressions . " " My job . When you 've been around Loshaks long as I have , you see subtlety , hear nuance . Look , let 's get back on track . Leave the Loshaks to me . " The edge was definitely in my voice . I decided to try a gentler tack . " You seem like a nice guy , Froman , but we have to - " He became rigid and narrowed his eyes . His reaction was too quick , too nervous . " I 'm married , very married , " he said . Well , that threw me . " That 's nice , very nice , " I said , " but what does it have to do with - " He relaxed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to think I was coming on to you . The whole harassment process in our - " " Oye , vaquero . I 'm up on the latest in harassment . But I 'm not going to call innocent talk harassment . Back on Belford 's - well , forget that . We do n't have much time for harassment suits there . I said to one of the guys , you 're no John Wayne , why do you strut when you 're around the other guys ? He said - he was married , too - he did n't want to be seen as pussywhipped . " " Yeah , I know . New term for that , too , after some protests . Only partly serious . Feline-dominated . " I could n't help laughing . " You 're kidding . Feline-dominated . Silly . " " Not - so silly when a word like pussy - " " Oh , stop . You do n't have to lecture me on the liberation of us cowgirls . Do n't tell me what I already know . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is create a new phrase and as long as it 's got more syllables than the original it 's all right . " For a moment that shut Froman up , and made me curse myself . Here I was , the expert on metalinguistics , tones , markers , the ins and outs of conversation , and I was about to lose it . Blow the interview . Why could n't I be a good little bureaucrat , like I was supposed to be ? I cursed Belford for shuffling me off the island , and for this . Froman , after a long pause , said , " The Loshaks , do you consider them ugly ? I mean , physically ugly ? I 'm sorry , I - " I could feel my blood racing , but was determined to stay calm . " They 're alien . NLU - not like us . " " I 'm just curious what it 's like to be around an alien species . You have to realize that a lot of people see them as , well , a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd look at us ? I 'm sure we 're no prizes in their eyes . Maybe they have their own views on physical appearances . A lot depends on how much bulk you have in your ass , if you 're a Loshak . " " You mean , a big , well , behind , is a sexy trait for them ? " " Actually , I was joking . " Clutching the folder , his voice got all official . Inside , I was kicking my own , well , slightly overplump behind . Why did n't I just shut up ? I was here to get money , not win a point on a middleman . I settled down after that , while he went on , asking the questions in an official monotone that I now found threatening . I did all right with the facts and figures , but could n't shake the thought that I had screwed up big time . If I went back to the island Belford had so inelegantly named after himself without the funding , I could kiss good evaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I rode in the taxicab , I could n't decide which was uglier , the urban sprawl sweeping by the car 's windows or Belford 's Island , with its rocky soil , scrawny trees , and ragged roads laid down by the Army construction team . Right then I longed for the desolation of Belford 's . Lost in my memories of the interview , I had n't been aware that my driver , Valerie , was talking to me . Valerie Tenison , her name written in thick bold letters on a large identification tag hanging on the cab dashboard , was a slim attractive black woman in a high-priced brown business suit . I 'd heard something on some cable TV program about this new breed of women cabdrivers , imitating the chatter of their male counterparts but classier in their elegant outfits and beauty shop hairdos . It was all right , but I kind of missed the guys in the turbans and their neat , broken-teethed smiles . You get the stereotype you deserve , maybe . I took a stab at making conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what she 'd already said . " Men complain about women taking cabdriver jobs , Valerie ? " " Nope , doll . " She spoke in what sounded like a put-on gravelly voice . " They did , we 'd pound " em into the pavement . Like they say , it 's a New World and plenty of it , honey . " " Doll ? Honey ? When I left the States nobody , male or female , was calling anybody doll or honey . " " New world , new ways . " " But why men 's endearments ? Why doll ? " . " Any macho bastard calls me honey or doll , I kick his balls right out of his body . " I did n't particularly care for the picture she summoned up , which involved both the male anatomy and a set of goalposts photographed from below . " Would n't it be better if we dropped terms like doll altogether ? " " No , the bastards 'd use " em , so we defuse " em . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't mind me asking ? " " Do n't mind . Yesenia . " " Pretty name . Hispanic , right . Or do you say , Latina ? " " I do n't use either word that often . I grew up in a family that denied ethnicity . My father wanted me to speak English all the time . " Feeling my eyes tear up as usual when I talked about him , I turned away , looked at some very expensive homes peeking out from behind iron gates and sculpted trees . I looked back to find Valerie staring at me quizzically in the rearview mirror . A toy pair of high-heeled glittery pumps hung from the mirror , in the way dice used to hang . " I 'm told I have an American accent when I do speak Spanish and that my grammar 's awful . " " Well , your pops was way off-base . Latina , Hispanic , nowadays they 're , like , medals of honor . Hey , you guys 'll probably own the country pretty soon and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's from our ol 's . So , Hispanic doll , that 's pretty good . Latina chick , even better , doll . " Although I smiled , there may have been an edge in my voice when I replied , " I wish you 'd stop using that word . " " Hey , doll , nasty gender words 're a man 's game . Play it , but play it with balls . " 3 . " Yesenia , Tu te ves confundido , prima - confused , frazzled , " Maria said as she alighted from her own cab and joined me at the enormous Maximall entrance . " Anything wrong , hon ? " I was so glad to see Maria , the best cousin in the whole world , again . It had been two years since I 'd last been stateside and we 'd rushed a quick lunch together , each hurrying on to our next event . This time , we had vowed , we 'd not let anything interfere with our afternoon together . I stared at her round face and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly older woman , the girl who 'd been my best playmate , her wide eyes welcoming any new experience , any new knowledge , any foolish thing that I said . The slight cynicism in those eyes now rattled me a bit , but I realized it might have come from the blue-tinted contacts in her eyes . I knew , from one of her e-mails to me , that she wore the contacts as a concession to her Irish husband , whom she loved beyond belief . So did I , in my cousinly way . Still , the eye color did not blend all that well with her light olive skin tones , even with her adept use of makeup . There were a few wrinkles in her face and a few more pounds on her already chubby body that I chose to ignore in favor of my image of the girl behind the mask . We stood beneath a frieze of lions in a jungle . When I had arrived too early , I had stared at the lions for a while , not being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fierce lunges at a bargain counter ? Devouring new products ? Honoring the eternal commercial success of The Lion King ? Maybe it did make some sense . Lions scavenge . Shopping , scavenging - not much difference in the way each custom was practiced . " Do n't you start , " I said , after we hugged . " Start with what ? " " Hon. All this honey , doll kind of talk . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . I call everybody I love hon. " I told Maria about my ride with Valerie . " Oh , yeah , " she said . " 1 heard about some of that , but it 's not all that common . Originated in some group that calls itself the Ms-Alliance , something like that , or maybe with my literary turn of mind I 'm making it up . Probably a small-time fad . Not for me . I still call my husband sweetface . " " Hope Valerie never hears that one . She might adopt it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need words to support it . I was overreacting . She was the cool , measured one , always had been . We went into a comfortable silence . A shiny red Porsche pulled up to the curb and let out passengers . " Nice car , " I commented . " I 'm so used to mud-splattered dented jeeps where I come from . " " With a dirty jeep , you 'd wind up somewhere in the outskirts of this parking lot . " " I do n't understand . " " The Mall here . You have to earn your parking space . Do it two ways . Either spend a lot and they 'll give you a computerized pass to let you park close and for free on an earned credit basis , no matter what a wreck your car is . The costliest vehicles get good spaces , too . It 's like the rest of the world : status or good consumerism earns you the space and the free fee . " I laughed . " You 're joking , Maria . " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuppeeism was dead ? de ninguna manera . It 's alive and well and living in our souls . see that light blue boxlike thing in the center of the windshield ? " She gestured toward the Porsche as it was beginning to pull away from the curb . " That governs where you are eligible to park . You do n't have the right parking status , a detector or something in the space sends up a screech and mall cops materialize to give you a ticket . Well , not a ticket actually , but a fee to your account . Very embarrassing . But that 's the system . Grew out of those windshield gizmos that let you cruise through toll sites - you know , E-Z Pass , Speedpass , whatever . Now that pass can even govern which roads you 're allowed to take . Silly , huh ? Demente . Glad I do n't drive . C'm on , prima , let 's shop to drop . " As we browsed , arm in arm , through the mall , I saw that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a bridal wing , another of stores all devoted to children 's clothes , and an especially long corridor lined with shoe stores . Along the way the ubiquitous military guards stood , usually with a hand flirting with their holsters . None of them were doing much , though we passed one rifling a shoulder bag of an obviously annoyed lady in a sari . Overall , the Maximall was not exactly like the malls I remembered from my last stateside visit . In one wing there was a group of masculinethemed shops . One , in whose display windows were models of various types of weapons against a colorful flowery canvas backdrop , was called the Guns and Roses Boutique . The clothes were drab and designed for rough terrain . Many of them had large flag patches on their shoulders , along with other patches that were fake insignia heralding a bunch of recent battles . " Oh-oh , perdon , " Maria said . " Got lost . Lo siento , prima . This is the machismo strip . Emerged from the wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest . Comes in reaction to some independent gutsy-woman kinds of stores that sprang up in many malls . " Two men in cut-down tees stood in the doorway of a sports arcade with the ungainly title of BustYourBalls and leered at us , while making some remarks that I could not quite hear , though the tone was clear . I wondered if they were pretending to be construction workers . Oh , God , I said to myself , there I go again with the stereotypes . Maria eagerly steered me away from the machismo strip . Fortunately , most of the shops we now stopped at did not proclaim social or political links , and few were reminders of global violence , so we enjoyed a couple of hours of what at least came close to old-fashioned shopping . I became more comfortable . At least The Gap and J. Jill had survived the disaster intact . Tiring , we decided to eat and Maria suggested Unity , an international restaurant located nearby . As we were about to go into Unity , I felt a hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Valerie . She had changed into a gingham dress in red-check pattern that startled me . " Yo , doll . Did n't expect to see me again , didja ? " " Well , no . " " I got to the cab stand , looked at all the people in their finery , said to myself , hey , hon , you need a break , time for a bit of shopping . Got this little number . You like ? " She did a dancer 's twirl in the gingham dress , looking for all the world like a dancer from an old Broadway show like Oklahoma . " It 's quite nice . Did n't " know that style was coming back . " " Retrofem 's all it is . The next thing , they say . You going to the trough ? " As if to join us , Valerie picked up three large shopping bags . " Um , yes . This is my cousin , Maria . Maria , Valerie . She drove me here . " " Hi , hon. Ooops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a reunion . You do n't need me at the table . I talk too much as it is . Maybe we can have a drink after . " " Join us , " Maria said . " We 've got lots of time to - " " Nope , doll . I 'm easy with it . You guys go and have a good lunch , and I 'll check you later . Hasta la whatever . " Valerie strolled ahead of us into the restaurant . " Interesting lady , " Maria commented . " You bet , but can you explain the dress to me ? " " Not at all . I never even heard of retrofem . Does n't seem like a good idea to me but , hell , all my life the same styles come around again . Whatever works , I guess . " " I noticed something during our walk . Most people are dressed normally , but some seem to proclaim affiliations - yet with contradictions , you know ? Guys in biker dress carrying briefcases , demure women wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsements they look like NASCAR coveralls , Valerie in her business suit cabbie outfit - for that matter , Valerie in gingham . " " Far as I know , it 's a way of claiming a place in society . You ask me , I think it began way back when - you know , teens and college students in unattractive outfits that nobody sensible would wear except to suggest good solid surly rebellion , gays wearing duds that proclaimed their sexual identity while incidentally setting the styles for the fashion industry , all those sartorial variations blacks wore to separate themselves from whites and then had to change when whites adopted them . Somebody calls it an I.D.I.D. - meaning identity identification . You declare your identity through clothes , accessories , patches , words and pictures on shirts and skirts . Today 's guys choose outfits that are extremes of machismo , confident women like to wear business suits . It 's pretty mild , and you 're only noticing the extremes . A lot of the outfits are quite stylish and mean nada . C'm on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motifs from countries all over the world . I found it a bit too colorful and bright . My eyes ached from the glare , and I could not relax them until we were sitting in a booth whose overhanging awning cut off some of the light . A hostess in a sweatshirt and sweatpants - the international attire , I guess , or some mysterious form of I.D.I.D. - flung menus at us and took our drink order . Each of the menu 's several pages seemed to feature a particular cuisine . After the waiter set down the drinks , I settled for a hamburger off the American specialty page , along with a Coke float . " Long time since I had real junk food , " I explained apologetically . Maria chose ropa vieja along with rice and beans , commenting , " As soy yo , que puedo hacer . Or as the gringos say , I am what I am . Like the Broadway song . " I lifted my margarita as a silent toast . Maria followed suit with her gin and tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 're things at the college ? " I asked . Maria shrugged . " Same-o , same-o . Maneuvering for tenure , promotion , recognition . A hundred committees trying to pretend that bureaucracy is n't driving the machine , pretending that our feeble anti-government protests have any effect , pretending we still have individualism because we can bitch within our territorial limits . I 'm just happy to have the tenure . Forget about promotion . I 'll be stuck in rank all my career , unpromoted and unpromotable , while my precious publish-or-perish colleagues bill and coo over the articles they 've just published in their refereed journals about some obscure woman poet who wrote a couple of poems on cocktail napkins while dining with Sylvia Plath . Or they take a survey of some useless educationist idea , feed the results through a computer , and write about how the whole mess proves something that nobody could really care about , at least outside the old territorial limits . Not for me , prima . I just teach my classes , do whatever I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subversive thought or two . Lo mismo , lo mismo . " " You could publish . What about those articles you were planning on Garca Mrquez and - " " I ca n't get myself to follow that yellow brick road . Besides , I do n't like a lot of what 's going on over in the publishing ballpark either . You know , I just reviewed a textbook , a new edition of a fine old text . But the original editor 's died and so they 've called in some young turks for the new edition . It 's like - well , I do n't know how to say it , just that it 's the times and the way things are . " " Ca n't follow you . " " ' Course you ca n't , mi vida . It 's all academic crap , anyway . Everybody these days has to satisfy so many factions that it dilutes the material . Mostly it 's gender , race , ethnicity . Got to make sure the kids get all the correct lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not what somebody tells me I ought to think . So I teach and read and little else if I can help it . " " It 's nice to be - " I said , but was interrupted by a man at the next table shouting at his waitress . " Wanna'nother one of these ! Now ! " he said . He was a big man . Broad shouldered and not yet going to fat . His blond hair was worn just a bit long , with tufts neatly touching the top of his ears . It was hard to judge from his scowling face , but I suspected he was generally considered handsome in a middle-aged , oozing-with-vitality way . A bit too whitebread for me , but not bad-looking . " We have a limit on the number of drinks we can serve , sir , " the waitress said . Maria , who had glanced behind her at the scene , turned her head back and whispered , " Most places have a strict drink count these days . " " You mean there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . All those organizations against drunken driving got their way , I guess . Started with designated drivers , then went to limits . Demente . " The man grumbled something I could not hear , and the waitress said , " That may be , and I understand your irritation , but I am here to take your food order or provide your check for the drinks , whichever you prefer . " I suspected that the waitress 's words represented a company response , to soothe the customary piques of its drinking customers . The waitress , a tall black woman with almost precise cornrow locks that swung easily when she moved her head , was pregnant and stood that way that pregnant women did , with her womb set forward and her back arched slightly backward . She held an order pad at the ready , and her pencil hand occasionally lowered to touch the side of her womb . Above her blouse pocket was a blue-bordered badge that said , " How may I serve you ? My name is Wanda Vitale . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Somewhat sobriety-challenged , I would say , " Wanda replied . " Hey , lady , do n't be sarcastic , I 'm - " " Please do n't call me " lady , " sir . " " What do I call you then ? " She tapped the pencil 's eraser on her name-badge . " How about my name ? Wanda . " " Wanda , please , my good woman - is that all right ? My good woman , I mean ? " " I can live with it , sir . " " Wanda , my good woman , I would like your Chili and Rice from the Spic page of your menu . " Maria turned her head to look at the man , but he did not seem to notice her . Sitting three tables away , my cabbie Valerie shifted nervously in her chair , looking ready to challenge the man to a duel . Wanda quickly wrote down the order , pressing her pen hard against the paper , and started walking away from the table . Either she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too intent on keeping her job to retaliate . " Wanda , huh ? " the man muttered loudly . " Wanda . Looks like that 's her trouble . Somebody stuck his magic wand into Wanda real good . " Shrugging , the man maneuvered a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket , fumbled one out , stuck it in his mouth and began to light it with a high thin flame from a shiny Zippo . A man in a dark suit with a redbordered manager 's badge on its lapel materialized beside him to remind him politely that this was a nonsmoker section and he was not allowed to light up here . The Beltway Maximall was an almost entirely nonsmoking facility except in designated sections , the manager said . He offered the man a seat in the smoking section , which at the moment was crowded and had a half-hour waiting list . The man threw up his hands in disgust , closed the Zippo with a deft wrist-flick , then crumpled the cigarette , which he tossed into a nearby flowerpot . The manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face . He began to walk away . " Tobacco police , " the man muttered . The manager almost broke stride but continued on . " Butt Nazi , " the man said in a louder voice . Noticing that I and Maria , among others , were watching him , he gave us a self-satisfied , sort of Jack Nicholson evil smile that made most of us turn back to our food . I continued to stare , but I turned away when his face relaxed and he smiled charmingly , then blew me a kiss followed by an almost graceful flourish of his hands . " Assholes are forever , " I said . " What were we saying ? " " I do n't remember . " I could not keep from glancing over at the man . Relaxed , he did turn out to be handsome . The confidence with which he looked around the room suggested he was accustomed to having people pay attention to him , a possibility that was reinforced by his expensive clothes . What was he doing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the struggle of being middle class ? I could have settled into the middle class life . Tending a home , with my skills getting me a pretty fat paycheck , raising children who would conduct themselves correctly in this world , keeping up the domestic homef ront like a loyal Andromache , living with a husband or lover whose life would be the exemplar of the best values , as mine would be too . Yo pudiero ser ama da casa . Been a perfect housewife , in fact . Something like Maria 's life , I guess . I would probably be comfortable teaching college . It would not have been a bad life , this life I 'd already rejected by going out in the field at low pay and , after my catastrophe of a marriage , rejecting most romantic offers . Wanda returned with the man 's order . She seemed to hover over the man as she deftly slid the plate in front of him . Her belly seemed to hover over the table even more than she did . She was certainly carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What are you , one of those chicks who stay on the job until the last minute , when it 's time to give birth ? " Valerie had her hands flat on the table in front of her . Her body clearly tense , she looked ready to spring up and spring forward , to fly over the table at him . Wanda backed away a couple of steps and said , " Will that be all , sir ? " Her face was calm . I was impressed by her restraint . As she began to walk away , her customer narrowed his eyes and said : " Wanda , huh . Good sturdy name , Wanda . Good sturdy girl from the look of you . I can see you now - you 'll drop that baby in the fields , wrap it up nice , and go back to pickin " the cotton . " Wanda whirled around , clearly ready to risk her job by taking a shot at a customer , but Valerie beat her to it . She was all over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the man grunted in pain and offered little response . She induced some damage before a trio of military guards got to the table . After some subdued interrogation , two of them escorted the man out of the restaurant . The other grabbed Valerie 's arm and began to lead her away . She resisted and he pulled at her roughly . Finally , she gave in and , after she had retrieved her three shopping bags , which she swung defiantly with her free arm , walked with him while unleashing a skein of insults . Wanda vanished into the kitchen . " How adept of that man , " Maria said suddenly . " His cotton-picking remark - it combined racism and sexism in a few words . Pity he did not read her nametag better ; he could have reached a third level . Her last name was Italian . " As we left the restaurant , we saw Wanda leave ahead of us . She was in street clothes . " Damn , " I muttered and chased after her . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I saw what happened . They did n't fire you , did they ? " Wanda smiled . " No . Quite the contrary . They gave me the rest of my shift off , to cool down and , well , you know , the baby .... " " Oh . I 'm sorry to intrude , but if they 'd fired you I would have .... " ; " Yes , I can see that . If you do n't mind .... " " Of course . " I watched Wanda walk away . She kept her body quite straight , especially for a woman so late in her pregnancy . " Yesenia , you look a little shaken , " Maria said as we resumed our mall walk . " I am . " " Well , we can go somewhere and relax . What 'd you like ? " I shrugged and looked toward an electronic store with several television sets in operation on a massive sidewall . I was about to look away when an image came on , of a Loshak sprinting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully . Even though the shot was from a helicopter , the Loshak 's speed kept putting it momentarily off-camera and I sensed the cameraman struggling to keep up with it . It had been a long while since any coverage at all of the Loshaks had taken place . After an initial flurry of stories about them , the media had quieted down . Other stories came along , buildings were blown up , fierce battles raged over foreign landscapes , and coverage of the Loshaks , hampered by government censorship of Loshak pictures , slowed down , then stopped . Taking Maria 's arm , I led her into the store . We went directly to the wall of TVs . Several screens showed a newsman in a studio . He stared into the camera , intensity in his face , his eyes narrowed , his expression more serious than serious . . " Who 's he ? " I asked Maria . " I do n't know his name . Brad or Brent or something , one of those TV names . " Brad or Brent was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens was currently under congressional investigation . The flyby , the visual of which was repeated as the newscaster continued , was meant to obtain the kind of image that the government had denied news organizations , establishing that these aliens were roaming freely on Belford 's Island . Brent or Brad introduced a commentator who had written a book with UFO in the title . The commentator said that the aliens " were among us , " and we had a right to be told more about them . Angry , I cursed bitterly and loudly , causing a young man wearing a T-shirt that endorsed a necrophiliac type of rock band to turn and say to me : " Do n't be scared , lady . It 's no big deal . The aliens arc probably fake . Another Orson Welles kind of deal . You know , like his Martian broadcast back in the Stone Age ? People got real scared back then , ran around the Jersey countryside . I saw a docu on it recently . Last Halloween . This is another show like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared now . I read a lot about aliens in tabloids and stuff , and those aliens 're nothing like this . Just a fake . Calm down . " Oddly , the young man 's words did calm me . It seemed better for people not to believe in aliens . As a panel of three more " experts , " each with credentials worse than his , joined the UFO guy , I convinced Maria to cut the mall trip short and leave . Maria , seeing the pain in my face , readily agreed . 4 The Loshak news story was picked up by a thousand other news networks and soon was on nearly every cable channel . By the time I testified at the Congressional hearing , it had become one of those major news stories that dominated conversations everywhere as it took up inordinate amounts of airtime and newspaper space . At the hearing , the congressmen interrogating me seemed distracted and not very interested in funding matters . I felt oppressed by their disinterest , even as I reeled off strong facts and figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a reaction in any of them . I wished my questioners would at least be hostile , the way congressional committee members were in the movies when the issue was on the line and the hero or heroine had to win them over . I lost hope as I came to fear that the cancellation of the scientific arm of the project was a done deal , had been even before the news stories . At least the questioning was held in a closed session , so I did not become part of the overall Loshak news blitz . That evening the news coverage , which I watched on an aged TV in my hotel room , was replete with bias against the project . In interview after interview so-called experts had misgivings about the need for a costly study of a few aliens who 'd crash-landed on Earth and , according to rumor , appeared to have no use for the humans who were studying them . Xenophobia ran high in these broadcasts , and the few who spoke in favor of the project seemed to falter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was an occasional good analysis of the situation by an objective observer , along with a surprising number of clergy saying why not be good Samaritans , but the main current of opinion went against the project . What good was such an expensive project if the only results of it were a few meager observations ? Bring the aliens stateside , they said , let us take a look at them . One bright-eyed young woman , whose identity I did not catch , even suggested a traveling public exhibition , with admission and lectures , the profits of which could , along with foundation funds , expand the study of the Loshaks by teams from major universities . A leading film director expressed the wish to film the aliens up close and personal . Things got worse when I switched to talk shows , especially those with phone-in commentaries from listeners who complained about the secrecy of the project and speculated that the Loshaks might contact other aliens and summon them to Earth for an invasion . This led to suggestions that the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiping out the aliens . I was almost amused by the visual inserts of scenes from a pair of old movies , Battlefield Earth and - of course War of the Worlds , both the old one and the recent remake . When they started with the Loshak jokes , I clicked the TV off and flung the remote onto a table . My nerves were on edge and I was breathing fast . Sitting on the edge of the bed , I tried to bring my emotions down . I was almost calm when the room 's phone rang , a loud ring that made my whole body jump . I answered with a rude hello , but heard Maria say , " Hi , hon. You okay ? " " I 'm on edge , that 's what I am . I mean , I hate the idea of the Loshaks being transported to the mainland and becoming sideshow performers . And that guy who wants to observe them up close and personal , I - " " I know . An idiot . " " What 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal . That really embarrasses me . Whatever happens , I know what I 'm gon na do . " " And that 's ? " " I 'm going to fight tooth and nail to become part of any study team that works with them here . Hell , I 'll be a zookeeper if that 's what happens . " " The way you 've described these aliens to me , I doubt they 'd submit to such a move . " " And then your gun-happy morons would have an excuse to mow them down . But you 're right in one way . The Loshaks 've never shown much curiosity about us or our world . They do n't even pay any attention to TV broadcasts . " " Pretty smart cookies then ? " ; " I guess . " " Look , hon. Let it go . Get some rest . Want me to come by ? " " No , I 'll be all right . " I put the phone down and turned on the TV , to see that the Loshak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking news , " another terrorist attack in the Middle East . First I saw half a building that remained after a bomb explosion , then I saw pieces of the building separate and fall away , while the commentator spoke about the incident having occurred only moments ago . The camera zoomed in on the corpses of a woman and child . The woman had apparently been trying to protect the child , and only a tiny arm and leg could be seen peeking out from under the woman 's body . It was at first difficult to tell whether these limbs connected to a child 's body or were just pieces lying next to it . I looked away and listened to the commentary , which was about how the bomb had been carried by a teenage militant who had been blocked from entering the building by the security forces there . He had , as displayed in a blurry shot from an outside security camera , whirled away from the guards , run down the street pursued by them , and thrown himself into an outside stairwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There the bomb had exploded . A passing tourist had spotted the chase and managed to fumble her camera into position , catching the boy disappearing into the stairwell , then the subsequent explosion . The picture wavered from the force and we watched as the camera evidently was wrenched out of the tourist 's grasp and plunged to the ground . The ground seemed to come up at the camera , like an aircraft crashing into the ground . The picture ended abruptly . After , the commentator noted how lucky they were that the tape had survived . I asked the TV set what luck could possibly be involved in any of this . As they went on with the story , showing more and more pictures of horrendous devastation , the Loshak coverage continued in a red-background scrawl at the bottom of the screen . I could n't look at either and tried to bury my face in a pillow . The pillow smelled faintly of coffee , probably from spilled coffee , and it gagged me . Switching off the TV , I tried to sleep but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to go down to the hotel bar and have a Turkey Club and a Sam Adams . I do n't usually order by brand name , but Sam Adams was different - and patriotic to boot . As I waited for my food , I noticed that the three TVs suspended over the bar , each showing a different network 's coverage , nevertheless had the same pictures of the terrorist attack , probably pool coverage , and all of them had a Loshak scrawl beneath , with the color of the background the only differing feature . Fortunately , the sound was low and I could angle my chair around so that I did not have to watch . A waitress carefully placed a beer glass in front of me and poured the beer slowly into it . I admired the grace of her actions . I looked toward the waitress 's shoulder to catch her name so I could thank her , but she unlike Wanda - did not wear a nametag. il " Sipping at the beer , I shut my eyes , grateful for the stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just what I need , I thought . Some guy with a passel of prepared pickup lines . Another your-barracks-or-mine idiot . I looked up and saw the rude man from the mall restaurant , now apparently sober . My God , I thought , of all the gin joints .... What is he doing here ! It does n't seem possible . I looked over my shoulder , fully expecting to see Valerie suddenly spring up from the woodwork , maybe sitting with the man with the rock band T-shirt from the electronic store at the mall . Fortunately , there was no other familiar face in the room . I thought Belford 's Island was small , but the way people kept walking back into my life here on the mainland was spooky . On the man 's lapel was one of those stick-on name tags that said , " Hi , my name is , " but there was no name written into the space below the phrase . He held a bottle of seltzer water in one hand , and a glass full of ice cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of withering insult the man deserved , but found I had no energy for it . " I do n't require any company just now , thank you very much , " I finally said . But he sat down anyway , then poured some of the seltzer water into the glass . I wondered if he planned to spritz himself as part of the comeon . " I wo n't stay long . It 's just me that needs company anyway . All right ? " Inadvertently I saw a close up of Zip Drive on the middle TV screen . The other two channels were still showing bomb wreckage . The pain of looking at Zip Drive distracted me from the man . " Do what you want . I do n't have to pay attention to you , after all . " He laughed . " The kind of riposte I deserve , I guess . " I was surprised by his use of the word riposte , and I looked more intently at him . I did not like to admit it , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , which were dark blue and clear . " I 'm not coming on to you , believe me . " Irritated , I sighed . " Why do n't you guys just stop with the protesting too much and just come on to women honestly , in the good old-fashioned male jerkoff way ? " " You got it . You are the prettiest girl I 've seen in a dog 's age . " " And you 're the ugliest dog I 've seen in a man 's age . " He laughed . " Good one , " he said . " Cute . " " Like I 'm cute ? " He gave me a most sincere stare . " More than cute , hon. " " Only my family gets to call me hon. " He waved his hands defensively . " Okay , okay , I 'll back off . I just want to talk , really . No coming on . Or perhaps I 'm coming on to your intelligence , not your physicality . " " That 's such - hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say ? I 'm all for banter in this languagestarved world of ours . " " Language-starved ? Just the phrase makes me shudder . I was just going to respond to your come-on in a come-on response way , a comebacker , a zinger , and I realize by doing so I 'm just playing your game . I do n't want your game . I do n't do games . I just want to be alone . " " Oh , a Garbo . " I nearly put my head down on the table in frustration . " A Garbo ? That 's so ridiculous . Do you realize that nobody minds if wanting to be alone draws some inane comment about Garbo ? What if Clark Gable had wanted to be alone ? Would it be called doing a Gable ? I do n't think so . He would have been admired for his calm and silent stoicism . There is something faintly ridiculous about the Garbo thing , as if a woman is never meant to be alone . Well , I want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sipped at his seltzer water . All the TV sets were showing coverage of the terrorist story , but one evidently was doing a background bio of the boy who 'd carried the bomb . In a photograph he had sad , almost questioning eyes . In his face was hope . Why hope ? Finally the man said : " I 'm sorry , then . Really . I understand femtalk . I really do . " In watching the bar TVs , I had forgotten what we had been talking about , and it took me a moment to reorient myself . " Femtalk ? Forget it . You do n't get it , and you never will , tonto . " " What are you talkin ' ? I 'm like the Lone Ranger 's sidekick ? " " No , tonto is Spanish for dumb . " " The Lone Ranger 's pal was dumb ? Tonto was dumb ? Now that sounds politically incorrect if I ever heard politically incorrect . " " I was insulting you , not a cultural icon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? Latina , right ? " I sighed . " I 'll let you say I 'm of Hispanic stock . Heritage . " " A real hot tamale , I can see . " " Go away , payaso . " " What does that word mean ? " " Clown . " Another silence . The man looked especially introspective . His eyes were sad . " I 'm a sorry son of a bitch , " he said , his voice quieter . I could not tell whether the sincerity was real . " I 'll grant that . I do n't know what drives me , what makes me say what I do . I was a reporter for a while , graduate in journalism from George Washington U. Eventually I got a crime beat - the small crap while the big-namers got to cover the glamour cases . Had to spend a lot of time in the streets , picked up a lot of the slang , most of it out of date now . The beat gave me a shot at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers . I liked that for a while , but eventually I got out of it all , gave it up . I made a lot of money on stocks by pestering our business reporters to explain the market to me . As a result , having a job no longer mattered . But I do care about language , and I do n't like what we 're doing to it . " " You 're the one who said femtalk . " " I know , I know . " " You were really a journalist ? That 's not part of your come-on ? I find it hard to believe . " " Well , I was . " " And I suppose then you 're married and monogamous . I mean , to go along with all the other contradictions in your behavior . " " Married , yes . Not happily . Could n't be monogamous if the survival of our species depended on it . " " Well , it does n't , and I wo n't . " " I can see that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . Hon. " " No , I like you . This is nice . " I was about to tell him I had observed his boorish behavior in the restaurant earlier when I became aware that all three screens above the bar were flashing a news bulletin sign . The same old film of the Loshak flyby quickly followed it . Shouting to the bartender to turn the bloody sound up , I got up and rushed to the bar . The man followed me . At the bar he took a position right next to me . He got a little too close , and the smell of mouthwash seemed to waft off his clothing , as if he used it instead of cologne . I slid a few inches down the bar . A newsman announced in an excited voice that the Loshaks had left Belford 's Island . They had all walked into the ocean . An hour later a volcanolike eruption of water had risen high in the air a few kilometers from Belford 's Island . The commentator stopped to listen to someone else through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Thrilling pictures . Roll the videotape . " First we saw the eruption of water in the wide expanse of ocean . Little by little , in that slow motion that begins a launch , the Loshak ship arose from the high waves , picked up speed , and headed upward at a speed higher than any human spacecraft had recorded . The commentator came back on and said they would imminently have footage from a satellite showing the Loshak ship sailing at an even faster speed away from Earth and on its way out of the solar system . " Looked like something out of George Lucas , " the bartender said . " Probably what it is . Some people say there are no aliens . " I only glanced at the bartender , then turned my attention to the screen as the final stage of the Loshak departure was shown . It was over so quickly . They were gone so quickly . Damn . Beside me , the man cupped his hands to his mouth and announced in a loud voice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Loshaks have left the planet . " A few of the other patrons laughed but without much enthusiasm . I sat on a barstool for a long while , watching the footage repeated and then talked about by a phalanx of solemn experts . One even called the Loshak departure God 's answer , but to what question I was n't sure . The bomb incident was , for the moment , relegated to the crawl . A flashing sign on the corner announced that the U.S. president would , within an hour , be commenting on the day 's events in a White House speech . In a sidebar there was a report that a beloved celebrity had died and a special tribute to her would be broadcast tomorrow night . I thought of my last day on Belford 's Island , what had turned out to be my last moments with Minnie and Zip Drive . Tears came into my eyes . I tried to rub them away but they began to fall harder , to run out between my fingers . The man put his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Crying over the creatures . I could n't do it , but - " " I know you could n't . Shut up . " I strode back to the table angrily . He followed . There was some anger in his voice as he said : " Sentimental . Just like a woman . " I grabbed the beer bottle off the table . For a moment I wanted to break it and ram the jagged edges into the man 's handsome face . But even in rage I could not do that . I did throw it , though , and it bounced off his forehead . He reeled back in pain . " Just like a honey , " I said . " Just like a doll , just like a chick . Excuse me , I 'm going to leave now . " " Hey , I 'm sorry , " he said , while fiercely rubbing his forehead at the area where the bottle had bounced off . " Give me a break . You 're upset . You need someone to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll behave , honest . " I spoke quietly , suppressing rage . " Look , in some circles you 're probably a nice guy . Intelligent . I could even like you . In some circles . But we 're dislocated or something , all of us . We 're identity-challenged . Hemmed in by the words we use . I 'm happy the Loshaks have left . Now they do not have to study us , try to figure out how we can be so reasonable , so generous , so filled with violence and desire for war . We use only right words - it 's like the E-Z pass to social belonging . We have race identities , ethnic identities , gender identities , job identities - everything but a human identity . The Loshaks probably saw that . I think that 's what I saw in their eyes without understanding it . " " You know the Loshaks ? " " I came here yesterday from Belford 's Island , and I 'm going back there tomorrow for - I do n't know what . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed with interest . He dropped his hand from his forehead and gestured toward me . " Now I know I want to know you . I 've been looking for a book to write . We have to talk . There 's a book in this , a - " " For you , maybe , not for me . Hey , I got to go , doll . " I went to the bar and slapped the bill for my meal down . A corner of the bill landed in a wet spot and a spot of moisture began to grow there . I moved the bill and put money down on top of it , along with what I hoped was a generous tip for the graceful waitress . On the left TV screen there was now a split screen , a repeat of the Loshak ship coming out of the water on one side , and soldiers pulling apart wreckage , apparently searching for bodies on the other . The man came up beside me . He spoke gently . " Stay . We need to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I considered turning around and giving him a Three Stooges two-fingered poke in both eyes . I considered working up enough spit to cover his face . Instead , I turned around and stared intently , saying : " Look , sir , I am sure you are capable of a fine intelligent conversation , laced with street-smart insights and all that crap . I am , in fact , sure there 's a human being in you , in there somewhere . But I 'll see you . " " Stay . " " No , thanks . " " But - " " Forget it . I got to go pick the cotton , man . " I did n't look back as I left the bar .
