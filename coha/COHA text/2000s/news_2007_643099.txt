<p> Midway through the recently concluded Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal , her first as vice president for programming , Maureen Taran was talking with a veteran stand-up comic who wondered , with evident envy , why so many young sketch groups were generating so much industry interest , and how he could get that kind of attention . <p> Her answer , she recalled , was simple : " Pick up a camera and do it yourself . " <p> This year , Just for Laughs was , as it has been for 25 years , largely a showcase for stand-ups from throughout the English-speaking world and a gathering place for comedy professionals . As usual , there were comedians who seemed poised to break through to a bigger audience ( Louis C.K. , Zach Galifianakis ) or who were ready to face North American audiences ( Jim Jeffries from Australia , Stephen K. Amos from Britain ) . But in at least two ways , this year was a little different . <p> With the sitcom format in decline , more than one festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-up could come to Montreal with a solid set and leave with a network development deal are long gone . That may at least partly explain why two of the hottest topics at Just for Laughs this year were sketch comedy and the World Wide Web . <p> Sketch comedy , never more than a sidelight at previous editions of Just for Laughs , was prominent this year . There were performances by , among others , the reunited Kids in the Hall and the anarchic British troupe Spymonkey . One of the most anticipated events was " The Lineup , " a showcase of six up-and-coming sketch groups , with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross of the fondly remembered HBO series " Mr. Show " as hosts . <p> Also present in greater numbers than ever , Ms. Taran said , were executives in search of Internet content , for television networks and cable channels , as well as for comedy Web sites like Super Deluxe ( superdeluxe.com ) and Funny or Die ( funnyordie . com ) . The two phenomena are not unrelated . The Web is proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not yet a very lucrative one . <p> Few people were willing to go as far as Mark Krantz , a veteran comedy producer in Montreal seeking talent for Super Deluxe , who said in an interview after the festival that " the Web just might be the future of all things comedy . " But comedy in general , and sketch comedy in particular , is already a big deal there . <p> Posting a clip on YouTube or MySpace can jump-start a comedy career : homemade digital videos helped propel Andy Samberg to " Saturday Night Live " and led to cable series for the sketch groups Human Giant and the Whitest Kids U'Know . <p> If the Web is still more a means to an end than an end in itself  --  getting on television remains most comedians ' goal  --  the ability to produce sketches quickly and cheaply , and to show them to the world almost as soon as they 're made , is changing the comedy landscape . Sites like Super Deluxe ( a unit of Turner Broadcasting ) and Funny or Die ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKay ) have the clout to make the Web not just a place to post clips but also a career option , for established comedians as well as for unknowns . <p> " The Web has opened things up , " said JoAnn Grigioni , the director of talent for Comedy Central , who was at Just for Laughs scouting acts both for the cable channel itself and for its Web site , comedycentral.com . " There 's so much more that you can do with talent that might not fit in a show on the air . " <p> " Comedy in general works really well on the Web , " Ms. Grigioni said . " It 's the only genre where you can be successful in 10 seconds or five minutes . " <p> Mr. Krantz of Super Deluxe agreed . " Sketch comedy is primarily short-form , " he noted . " You have to get in and you have to know when to get out "  --  which makes it , he said , " perfect for the Web . " <p> The Los Angeles comedy team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch showcase ( although they did not actually perform ; they stayed backstage while their clips were shown to the audience on a big screen ) , echoed that sentiment . In an e-mail interview , the two comedians , Leon Mandel and Andy Fisher , whose bizarre shorts can be seen online at www.weepirate.com , said : " The Web is an amazing venue for sketch comedy . It 's practically built for it . People want short , easily digestible pieces that they can ingest on their lunch breaks and share with their friends . " <p> Mr. Mandel and Mr. Fisher said the Web had become their primary outlet . " We used to perform live a lot more than we do now , " they wrote . " But when you can spend your energies making films that you can propagate onto the Web for perpetuity , performing for a crowd at a bar loses a little of its luster . We still love it , but we do it sparingly . " <p> The situation is a little different for the Buffoons , a troupe affiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also on the " Lineup " bill , jolting the crowd with what might be called Three Stooges routines for the new millennium . <p> In a telephone interview , Bobby Moynihan of the Buffoons said the group had been " approached primarily by Internet people " at the festival and , with possible deals being discussed , faces the challenge of making its visceral comedy work online . " We 're a very physical group , " he said . " That 's one of our biggest obstacles right now , because it 's hard to translate that to film or television or the Internet . " <p> Still , he said , the Buffoons are ready ; they expect to be well represented online in the near future , when the Upright Citizens Brigade site ( ucbtheatre.com ) begins posting videos . He has had a taste of Web fame already through his bit part in a raunchy clip by another sketch troupe , Derrick ( derrickcomedy.com ) , which he said was shot in one afternoon and which has been viewed three million times on YouTube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'd have an act that could be turned into a sitcom , " Mr. Moynihan said . " Now if you have 20 seconds , you can put it up there and you 'll be more famous than someone who spent years developing an act . " <p> That sound you just heard is the collective click of comedians everywhere turning on their cameras. ##
