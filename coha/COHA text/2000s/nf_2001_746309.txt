Editor 's Note : The author previously served from 1997 to 2001 as special assistant for Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense . U.S. Department of Defense . The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely the author 's and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. government . <p> The foundation of U.S. security strategy for the Asia-Pacific region is outlined in the most recent official overview of U.S. security policy , A National Security Strategy for a New Century , which was published by the Clinton administration in December 1999. ( n1 ) The strategy 's three core objectives are to ( a ) enhance U.S. security with effective diplomacy and with military forces that are ready to fight and win , ( b ) bolster America 's economic prosperity , and ( c ) promote democracy abroad . <p> None of these elements should surprise an observer . Nor are they intended to exclude or challenge another nation 's ambition for security and prosperity . U.S. security strategy is based on the fundamental notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets and free societies , is the strongest basis on which true lasting national and international security may be sustained . <p> In the post-Cold War world , threats to international peace and security emanate as much from general instability and the forces , such as terrorism , that promote it as from traditional cross-border military aggression . Stability is also threatened as nations undergo painful political and economic transitions that throw populations into turmoil as countries seek to deal with the implications of economic dislocation , political development , and globalization . Such instability diverts resources away from productive enterprises . The effects of these forces often cross borders and undermine the welfare of other states . The United States seeks not to prevent change within transitional societies but to dampen sources of instability , promote constructive solutions , and assist those nations as appropriate to manage their transitions with minimal disruption to themselves and their neighbors . <p> The United States has presented the three integrated concepts of " Shape , Respond , and Prepare " to represent its approach to safeguarding U.S. security interests : shaping the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international assistance , arms control programs , nonproliferation initiatives , and overseas military presence ; maintaining the capability for responding across the full spectrum of potential crises , up to and including fighting and winning major theater wars ; and preparing today to meet the challenges of tomorrow 's uncertain future. ( n2 ) These concepts capture U.S. security strategy around the world , including the Asia-Pacific region . U.S. Strategy for the Asia-Pacific <p> As enunciated in the 1998 " United States Security Strategy for tile East Asia-Pacific Region , " the United States seeks to promote a stable , secure , prosperous , and peaceful Asia-Pacific community in which the United States is an active partner and beneficiary. ( n3 ) The United States has fought three major wars in East Asia over the past century , with enormous losses in blood and treasure . Approximately 400,000 U.S. citizens , excluding military personnel and dependents , live , work and study in the region . U.S. businesses conduct more than $500 billion in trade annually with East Asian countries and have invested more than $150 billion throughout the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia , which will continue to increase if the dynamism and industry of Asia 's recent past are any indication of its future . The United States seeks to promote the peaceful resolution of disputes , to reduce tensions , to secure freedom of navigation and other basic rights enshrined in international law , and to promote growth and development throughout the region . <p> The United States has learned the lessons of history : as Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in 1997 , " Today , there are some who would have us pull back from the world , forgetting the central lesson of this century : that when America neglects the problems of the world , the world often brings its problems to America 's doorstep . " ( n4 ) For these reasons , the U.S. approach of " Shape , Respond , and Prepare " is relevant : to the U.S. interest in promoting an environment of mutual security and stability in Asia . Military Force Presence <p> Maintaining an overseas military presence  --  including forces stationed in Japan and Korea , as well as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both U.S. national security strategy and of the " Shape , Respond , and Prepare " approach . The maintenance of approximately 100,000 U.S. military personnel in Asia has long provided critical practical and symbolic contributions to regional security . Those forces promote security and stability , deter conflict , and give substance to U.S. security commitments . Perhaps most important . U.S. military presence in Asia serves to shape the security environment to prevent challenges from developing at all . That presence in Asia first serves as an important deterrent to aggression , often lessening the later need for a more substantial and costly U.S. or regional response . Should deterrence fail . U.S. presence enables rapid response . Nations throughout the region recognize and strongly support the continued presence of the United States as a critical stabilizing factor for regional security . Alliances <p> U.S. alliances in Asia have served as the cornerstone of U.S. security strategy for the region and of regional security itself . Since the early 1950s , the United States has maintained alliances with Japan , South Korea , Australia , Thailand , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. alliances were directed at various third powers , the alliances today represent a force for stability in an era of great political , economic , and social transition in the region . As such , they serve the interests of all in the region who have benefited from general regional stability and security . <p> The U.S.-Japan alliance remains the linchpin of U.S. security strategy in Asia . Bases in Japan remain the anchor of the U.S. regional force presence , and thus contribute substantially to regional stability . The end of the Cold War changed the security environment in Asia and challenged some assumptions about the purpose and role of the alliance . The United States and Japan recognize the fundamental and continuing contribution of the alliance to the defense of Japan and to regional peace and stability . Both sides have moved actively over the past three years to update the framework and structure of joint cooperation to reflect the new environment . The United States has also sought to promote a more active and direct Japanese role in regional security , particularly in nonwarfighting areas such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the long term , the United States seeks a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict with a nonnuclear , democratic , reconciled , and ultimately reunified peninsula . Toward that end , the security alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) serves as the foundation on which rests all U.S. diplomatic , defense , and economic efforts on the Korean peninsula . The U.S. treaty commitment and the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea have been key deterrents of North Korean aggression by making it unmistakably clear that the United States would immediately become fully engaged in any such conflict . The United States and ROK continue to maintain and strengthen the three major elements of the security alliance : the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty , bilateral consultations , and combined military forces . <p> The United States also takes a longer-term view of its relationship with South Korea . The U.S.-ROK alliance will continue to promote stability and deterrence on the peninsula and promises to contribute equally to general regional stability in the future . The United States welcomes the public statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the bilateral alliance and the U.S. military presence even after reunification of the Korean peninsula . <p> The U.S.-Australia alliance remains as close as any U.S. alliance in the region , providing the anchor for U.S. presence in the southern part of the Asia-Pacific region . Thailand has been a consistent supporter of the U.S. presence in Asia and a strong partner in addressing global and regional security issues , including transborder matters such as counterproliferation and drug trafficking . The United States is gradually establishing a post-bases relationship with the Philippines in ways , and at a pace , comfortable to the Philippine people . It has resumed exercises with the Philippine military and looks forward to solidifying its security partnership in coming years to support this long-standing alliance . Bilateral Relationships <p> The United States values highly the development of its bilateral and multilateral relationships throughout the region . The relationship with China is clearly the most important of these . The United States understands that lasting security in the Asia-Pacific region is not possible without a constructive Chinese contribution . Thus , the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a substantial interest in China 's emergence as a stable , secure , open , prosperous , and peaceful nation . The United States recognizes that the two sides share many common global and regional interests : Both sides have an interest in maintaining regional stability to foster the continuation of Asia 's economic development . Both share strong interests in maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula and in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery . Both have profound interests in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan matter . Both have concerns for world and Asian stability that could result from South Asian tensions and military developments . And , finally , both cooperate in countering a wide range of transnational security threats , such as environmental degradation , terrorism , and drug trafficking . <p> The United States seeks to promote trust and confidence between the two sides . To that end , the United States will seek further progress in Chinese military transparency , particularly in strategic doctrine , budgets , and force structure . To further develop mutual trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries access to accurate and balanced information about the other and dampening inaccurate or negative propaganda about the other in official statements and publications . Ultimately , the United States seeks a stable , productive relationship with China that is sufficiently broad . In scope to address the many key security issues of mutual interest around the region and the world Consequently , the United States seeks to prevent any single issue from dominating the bilateral agenda : furthermore , the United States seeks to promote China 's integration as a productive and constructive member of the international community . <p> The United States also views Southeast Asia  --  particularly a strong , cohesive Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN )  --  as an important component of regional stability and security . Other goals , such as safeguarding freedom of the seas and achieving a peaceful resolution of competing territorial and sovereignty claims ( particularly in the South China Sea ) , also remain important for mutual security in the area . In addition , the United States values highly its relationships with individual members of ASEAN . Singapore is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with Vietnam is proceeding gradually but promises to overcome the impediments of history for the mutual benefit of both nations and the region . <p> As the world 's fourth most populous nation and home to the world 's largest Muslim population , Indonesia has played a pivotal role in regional security . As the gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans . Indonesia straddles some of the world 's most critical sea lanes , through which substantial levels of regional trade pass . Instability in this region , including the prospect of substantial refugee flows , would affect key Asia-Pacific interests by producing major ripple effects on Indonesia 's neighbors ( and beyond ) . The United States is committed to Indonesia 's territorial integrity and has been engaged actively and comprehensively in assisting Indonesia during its difficult transition . Finally , Russia is an Asia-Pacific nation , as well as a European one . Although Russian engagement in Asia is fitful , the United States welcomes its open and constructive participation in regional security affairs . Multilateralism <p> The United States welcomes the relatively rapid development in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond traditional bilateral relationships . The United States engages in official and unofficial multilateral security dialogues to enhance mutual cooperation and trust , most notably the ASEAN Regional Forum . It also promotes the development of " minilaterals , " or meetings between small subsets of nations , typically three or four , designed to address common security interests in a more focused setting . The Four Party Talks in Korea are one example . The U.S.-Japan-Russia , and U.S.-Japan-ROK meetings are others . The United States continues to encourage the development of an official or semi-official U.S.-Japan-China forum . <p> Ultimately , the United States views the reaffirmation and enhancement of its alliances over the past three years , the concurrent and complementary development of constructive ties with nonallied states , and its support of multilateralism as evidence of its continued confidence that an integrated network of security relations is in the mutual interest of all Asia-Pacific nations . These approaches are meant to complement rather than supplant one another , overlapping and interlocking to promote general stability and constructive relations among nations . Democracy <p> Promotion of democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A National Security Strategy for a New Century . Promoting democracy does more than foster U.S. ideals : it advances U.S. interests because a larger pool of democracies benefits the entire community of nations . Support for the growth of democratic institutions and processes in Asia will remain a key U.S. security interest . <p> Promoting democracy does not mean aggressively installing a U.S. model of democracy on another country ; rather , it means promoting the notion that democratic values of tree speech , transparency , and accountability are critical for ensuring sustainable development and stable societies . Those values will also inform the way nations interact with each other , enhancing openness and ultimately promoting mutual confidence and regional stability . In those ways , democratic values serve U.S. security interests . <p> The United States will continue to promote the development of democratic processes and norms through the Asia-Pacific region . The United States recognizes that many Asian nations have achieved difficult but successful democratic transitions over the past several years . Their achievements , as well as the aspirations of millions of others in the region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States remains committed to assisting all nations of the region in the realization of that promise in the spirit of common security . Transnational Security <p> The United States also recognizes the need to consider a broader definition of security that encompasses elements unrelated to traditional military power and influence . Threats such as terrorism , environmental degradation , infectious diseases , drug trafficking , and humanitarian disasters may bypass military forces entirely to directly threaten the basic political , economic and social fabric on which the stability and prosperity , and therefore security , of a nation or region is based . Other transnational problems , particularly proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery , are central to U.S. and regional security perceptions and thus call for appropriate individual and multilateral responses . Transnational threats clearly require transnational remedies . The United States recognizes the critical need for closer consultation , cooperation and coordination of international efforts to combat transnational threats in the region . The United States continues to believe that at the heart of these efforts is the continuation of America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion <p> Although the United States sees an Asia-Pacific region mostly at peace , it intends to help dampen sources of instability by maintaining a policy of robust engagement , overseas presence , and strengthened alliances , while searching for new opportunities to increase confidence and a spirit of common security . Where the U.S. strategy during the Cold War was primarily one of worldwide strategic deterrence , today the United States must deter actions in critical localized areas such as the Korean peninsula while maintaining the capability to respond to additional crises should they emerge elsewhere . In times of peace , the United States seeks to work with allies and friends to shape the strategic environment to sustain the peace and prevent conflict over time . <p> As we enter a new century , the United States finds itself the sole remaining superpower . Clearly , a global power with global interests has global responsibilities and commitments . For better or for worse , the United States is in many instances the only nation capable of providing the necessary leadership for an international response to shared challenges . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to promote global development and security , whether through the World Trade Organization , the United Nations , or international financial institutions . The United States has redefined and reaffirmed its defense relationships , and occasionally sought to expand them , not for aggressive purposes but in the interest of common defense and general stability and security . No nations are excluded from this concept of common security , and the United States continues to work with its allies and friends to develop this concept further . The United States believes that developing such a framework by applying the basic elements of the structure that kept the peace and promoted common regional development and prosperity over the past fifty years is not only appropriate but is strongly welcomed by Asia-Pacific nations . <p>
