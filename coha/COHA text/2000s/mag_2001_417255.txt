Nevertheless , chairs with reliable provenances linking them to old Delaware families do survive , and attention to the histories and the design of these chairs yield a core of furniture that may reasonably be called Delaware-made . Although this study is incomplete , findings to date shape our understanding of seating from this region and encourage the search for additional examples and documentation.1 In the absence of bills , labels , and other historical evidence of chairmaking , histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from five sets of chairs associated with the Vincent Loock erman family of Dover survive and offer a convenient , and remarkable , starting point . That Loockerman owned five sets of chairs strains credibility until his probate inventory is considered . Proved on September 7 , 1785 , it describes five different sets in four rooms.2 All of these chairs remained in the family until the 1960s . When four of the five sets were sold over the next decade or so , their provenances remained intact . Examination of the chairs indicates that three of the sets were probably made in Philadelphia and two were of local origin . Photograph Pl . II . Side chair , Delaware , possibly Dover , 1745-1765 .

This is part of a set of one armchair and six side chaps originally owned by Loockerman . Biggs Museum of American Art , Dover Delaware ; Zullinger photograph . // The set of chairs still owned in the Loockerman family provides a logical starting point ( see Pl . II ) . The set is represented by four side chairs and the splat of a fifth . They have solid splats of figured walnut , compass seats ( so-called for their rounded seats laid out with a compass ) , and cabriole front legs with carved feet joined to chamfered rear legs by shaped stretchers . The chairbacks are gently S-shaped to conform to the sitters body Shells decorate the crest rails and knees , and volutes mark the bottoms of the leg brackets . All of these features indicate the Queen Anne style except the projecting ears of the crest rail , which are a Chippendale feature . Thus , the chairs were probably made some time after 1744 , the date the Loockerman house was built near the center of Dover . Comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Anne seating demonstrates both dependence and individuality on the part of the maker in the Dover area . The essential features of design and construction lie within the Philadelphia regional idiom , but the shapes of the splat and crest rail , the socklike trifid foot , and the carved details are singular and notably nonurban . The splat , for example , differs from Philadelphia models in having very high ears and a very broad massing near the base . In addition , the edge of the splat is barely chamfered in contrast to the then nearly universal deep chamfers , which create sharp edges and eliminate any visible clue to the thicks of the board . The ears reach outward and " horizontally well beyond the usual boundaries . The rear legs are rounded at the back and chamfered at the front , thus combining two common rear-leg treatments . These and other qualities argue for a local origin , possibly Dover itself , where the furniture makers John Bell ( w. c. 17571768 ) and John Gordon ( w. 1764-1774 ) are documented as working in 1767.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes more likely in light of the relationships between this set of chairs , a dressing table owned by the Loockermans , and a second set of walnut Queen Anne style chairs owned by the Loockermans . The claw-and-ball foot dressing table , now in the Biggs Museum of American Art in Dover , 4 differs from both sets of chairs but has the same floral pendants below the shells on the knees , carved volutes on the leg brackets , and wide scratch beading outlining elements , all of which indicate that the table was probably made by the same maker as the chairs . The second set of Loockerman walnut Queen Anne style chairs consists of six side chairs and one armchair , all with square seats ( see Pl . III ) . However , as is the case with the dressing table , there are similarities between this set of chairs and the compass  --  seat chairs . Foremost is the splat , which duplicates the pattern . The stretchers , volute-carved leg brackets , and scratch-beaded outlining are also the same . The set with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no shells on the knees , the shell in the crest rail is simpler , and the legs end in simple pad feet . The other three sets of chairs with Loockerman associations were made in Philadelphia . The city represented an overland journey of less than ten miles from Dover to the shore of the Delaware River and from thence convenient conveyance upstream . The Loockermans were probably typical of prosperous pre-Revolutionary residents of Delaware in fishing their houses with a combination of locally made goods and finer wares from Philadelphia . An example of this practice is William Corbit , a prosperous tanner , who furnished his grand house in Cantwell 's Bridge ( now Odessa ) , Delaware , which was completed in 1774 , with both local and Philadelphia-made furniture.5 Of the three Loockerman chair sets made in Philadelphia , the one with Marlborough legs is the best documented ( see Pl . IV ) . Two side chairs from the set are now in local Dover collections . The armchair of the set was sold with many other Loockerman furwith square seats ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , found in the parlor Therefore , the Queen Anne style set with compass seats ( see Pl . II ) must have been the one in the " Front Room up Stairs . " Like the use of mahogany , the presence of rounded seats and extra shell carvings translated into a significantly higher value for this set compared to the set with square seats . Whereas the Loockerman sets of chairs exhibit reasonably clear design differences between locally made and Philadelphia chairs , a welldocumented set of chairs in the Winterthur Museum in Winterthur . Delaware , blurs this distinction . It consists of an armchair and three side chairs that constitute half a set that descended in the family of William Corbit ( see Pls . V and IX ) .

" Delaware State Museum Dover ; zrw-photograph. // No specific feature affirms a Delaware origin for the Corbit chairs . However , a pattern of workmanship that suggests nonurban manufacture combined with a reliable provenance and a capable cabinetmaking community in Odessa , led by John Janvier ( 1749-1801 ) , make a reasonable argument for local origin . Among the nonurban aesthetic factors is the contrast between the complex design of the back ( derived directly from English prototypes ) and plain legs and other features . Also , the maker was content to use the same splat template for both the side chairs and the larger armchair , producing a somewhat crowded effect in the backs of the side chairs . The corner blocks reinforcing the insides of the seat rails are made of mahogany , rather than the cheaper pine or Atlantic white cedar almost universally used in Philadelphia chairs . The case for the local origin of the Corbit chairs becomes stronger upon consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Janvier family and has long been ascribed to the Janvier workshop on that basis.16 The outline of the splat and crest rail , the pattern of the undercut seat rails , and the shape of the knee brackets follow Philadelphia practices very closely . 17 In contrast , the arms and arm supports are brutally square . The crest rail , splat , and front seat rail lack the contouring and carved details that help organize the visual relationships of the pierced elements on most urban chairs . Interestingly , neither the Corbit chairs nor the Janvier armchair have side rails mortised through the rear posts as is so common ( but not universal ) in Philadelphia work . However , more chairs must be considered before this can be considered more than simply coincidental . In the absence of more visible differences , Photograph Pl . VIIIa .

Laird/New Castle/Delaware . " Private collection ; Zullinger photograph . // minor details of design and workmanship assume an important role . For example , the maker of the Corbit chairs attached an extra strip of wood on the inside of the rear seat rail immediately below the shoe . " Perhaps intended to stop the back of the slip seat , this element is structurally unnecessary . To date , this rare construction feature has been observed on only a few Delaware-owned chairs , including an armchair in the Biggs Museum of American Art in Dover ( Pls . XVII , XVIIa ) .19 This armchair is part of the same set as a side chair with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements include an angular shell on the front seat rail and the omission of two long teardrop piercings in the base of the slat , making it look heavy The arm supports recall a chair owned by John Ross Key ( 17541821 ) of Baltimore as well as the McKinly chairs discussed below . " An overabundance of small , wormlike volutes worked into the beaded outlines of the splat and crest rails of the Corbit chairs suggest a tentative link to another chair with a Delaware history of ownership . Although similar volutes are common in Philadelphia , other colonial centers , and England , the excessive number of tiny wormlike volutes on these chairs recalls a Marlborough-legged side chair ( PL VIII ) that descended in the family of Daniel Rodney ( 1764-1846 ) of Lewes , Delaware , who was governor of the state from 1814 to 1817 . Without a history of ownership in Delaware , this side chair would readily pass for one made in Philadelphia or any surrounding community . The Rodney side chair incorporates another construction detail that typically occurs in high-style Philadelphia seating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction technique entails notching the ends of the shoe ( between the base of the splat and the top of the rear rail ) into the sides of the rear posts ( PI . VIma ) . This helped secure the shoe to the rail in addition to the use of glue and/or nails . To find this detail in relatively plain Delaware  --  owned chairs raises the possibility of an intriguing pattern of use . The notches appear on a simple side chair ( Pl . X ) owned in the Philip D. Laird family , who lived in the George Read II House in New Castle from 1920 to 1975 . The notches also appear on another side chair ( PI . XIII ) pictured in situ in the Read House in an 1886 family scrapbook . Only further research can establish whether this apparent pattern is statistically and historically meaningful . One of the possible Philadelphia sources for this construction technique available to Delaware chairmakers is the Loockerman set of chairs made by Randolph ( see Pl . IV ) .

Biggs Museum of American Art , gift of Mariana Janvier Brown ; Zullinger photograph . // Two armchairs , representing separate sets , have independent histories of ownership by Dr. John McKinly of Wilmington , the first president of the Delaware General Assembly . Such provenances must always be approached cautiously , but McKinly 's estate inventory describes the two sets in question : " Two Mahogany Arm Chairs &; 7 ditto without arms , $53.00 " in the " Best Parlor , " and " One Arm Chair &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Best Chamber . " 22 The latter set appears to be the one given to the Historical Society of Delaware in Wilmington by the estate of Maria Whitney Bellah , who died in 1927 ( see PI . XIV ) . The unorthodox carved decoration of the ears of the crest rail and the gadrooning applied under the seat rails as well as the modern  --  looking surface led some scholars to conclude that this set was out of period.23 But circumstances suggest otherwise . The tradition of ownership extends back to the donors husband , Thomas S. Bellah ( 1845-1910 ) , who came from a prominent Wilmington family . Moreover , the physical properties of each set of chairs suggest that they were made in the same shop , thus reinforcing their common ownership by McKinly . The two-armchair set listed in the McKinly estate inventory ( see Pl . XI ) 24 differs in appearance from the other one-armchair set , but it shares several construction and design features . Both sets have the same pattern of pins securing the eight mortise-and  --  tenon joints that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both use a laminated board inside the rear seat raid . Among the decorative details that are common to both sets of chairs are the shape of the shoe and the arm handholds and the unusual shaping at the base of the arm support ( see Pl . I ) . The leg carving , although slightly different in design in the two sets , embodies similar layouts and carving techniques . As is the case with so much Delaware-owned seating fur-niture , determining the place of origin in the absence of written records is speculative at best . The unusual arm supports and the distinctive , non-Philadelphia decorative qualities of the one-armchair set ( see Pl . XIV ) combine to suggest that both McKinly sets were more likely made in the vicinity of Wilmington than Philadelphia . Design sources for these chairs were abundant . Even such accomplished details as the crisply executed acanthus motif in the crest rail of the two-armchair set ( see Pl . XI ) have ready prototypes , such as a pair of chairs ( see Pl . XV ) once owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous generation . These chairs , which also have splat shoes of the same shape as the McKinly chairs , descended in the Ridgely family in Dover , where McKinly served as the president of the Delaware General Assembly in 1777.25 Delaware-made furniture is better defined by what it is not than by what it is . Identification of the Jones chairs as products of Philadelphia relies on the simple premise that Delaware chairs must exhibit some design or construction attribute considered outside the range of Philadelphia practices . Admittedly inexact , this standard is still useful . For example , another chair that descended in the Ridgely family is very similar to the Jones chairs but was probably made in Delaware . It is of cherry , a wood more commonly used outside Philadelphia and specifically favored in documented Delaware furniture.26 More telling of its nonurban origin is a delightfully original detail in the crest rail shell .

The inscription on the bottom of the slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Philadelphia , whose account books record transactions with Loockerman but without specifying the objects ! The set of Marlborough-legged chairs documents unequivocally that prosperous Delaware families patronized Philadelphia furniture makers , which complicates the identification of Delaware-made as opposed to Delaware  --  owned seating furniture of this period . The remaining two sets of chairs may be ascribed with confidence to anonymous Philadelphia makers on the basis of stylistic analysis . Both were sold out of the Loockerman family to the United States Department of State in the early 1970s.8 One of these sets , made of walnut and having a strapwork splat design , is comprised of one armchair and six side chairs ( see Pl . VI ) . Extravagantly carved , its decorative details relate it to several other sets of chairs , one of which is documented to the Philadelphia cabinetmaker Thomas Affleck ( 1740-1795 ) .9 Small differences in design and construction among all these sets suggest that more than one maker was responsible . The other set of the two referred to above is made of mahogany and has splats of a ribbon design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles other Philadelphia sets of chairs.10 Unlike the uniformity exhibited within each of the four other sets , the six side chairs in this set display a significant difference in the splat that separates them into two groups of three . One group has a round hole with a carved floral border in the base of the splat , whereas the other does not . Further confusing the situation is a side chair in the Brooklyn Museum of Art in Brooklyn , New York , that seems to match the three Loockerman ribbon-backed chairs with a pierced hole . " Without the reliable Loockerman provenance and inventory record , scholars would readily identify the six Loockerman ribbon-backed chairs as a later combination of examples from two eighteenth-century sets , one of which included the Brooklyn chair . This unusual circumstance calls for further inquiry . Of the five sets of chairs listed in Loockerman 's inventory the most expensive was the " 6 Mahogany Chairs with Damask Bottoms @ 42/6 see Pl .

VI " each and " 1 Arm do- do- with do- do- @ 50/ " in the room immediately above the parlor This probably describes the set with strapwork splats . The amount of work required to make each of these two sets was probably comparable , and the 1785 valuation probably placed a premium on mahogany Also , the ribbon-backed set might have looked more ornate to those conducting the estate inventory . The " Blue Room up Stairs " had " 6 Leather Bottomed Walnut Chairs , ( old ) @ 15/ " and " 1 Ditto arm Chair @ 2216 . " Another " 6 Leather Bottom Chairs @ 15/ " were in the " Front Room up Stairs . " The lowest valued set comprised " 6 old Leather Bottom Chairs @ 6/ " and " 1 Arm 'd ditto @ 10/ . " Interestingly , this set was in the parlor along with the most expensive set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent arrangement or the result of special circumstances.12 The Blue Room set ( see Pl . IV ) probably refers to those chairs made by Randolph , noted as " ( old ) " even though their Marlborough legs identify them as stylistically the newest of all five sets . But twenty years of use may have taken a toll . The set is made of coarsegrained monochromatic mahogany that looks like walnut , as described in the 1785 inventory . The Queen Anne style set of walnut chairs Footnote I This study omits a pair of eighteenth-century Philadelphia Queen Anne side chairs traditionally owned by Mrs. John McKinly ( nee Jane Richardson ) published in Deborah Dependahl Waters , Delaware Collections in the Museum of the Historical Society of Delaware ( Historical Society of Delaware , Wilmington , 1984 ) , No. 1 , p. 12. 2 The inventory is in Wills and Inventories , Delaware State Archives , Dover . 3 Each was sufficiently well established to take on apprentices in 1767 .
