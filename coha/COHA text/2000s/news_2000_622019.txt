<p> A mysterious homicide that has unnerved Palo Alto residents for two weeks took a surprising turn yesterday with the arrest of a prominent real-estate consultant , who police say strangled and beat his wife to death . <p> Investigators said they linked the death of the popular music teacher to her husband , Kenneth Carroll Fitzhugh Jr. , through DNA tests and his conflicting statements that her death was an accident . <p> Kristine Pedersen Fitzhugh 's body was found at the bottom of the couple 's basement stairs on May 5 , but detectives believe she was bludgeoned and strangled in her kitchen . <p> Her corpse was then moved to the basement and staged to look like an accident , according to detectives ' affidavits filed in the case . <p> Fitzhugh , 57 , is to be arraigned on a murder charge on Tuesday . He remained in the Santa Clara County Jail last night on a no-bail hold . <p> An arrest warrant was issued yesterday afternoon for Fitzhugh , who was taken into custody on Hesperian Boulevard in Hayward . Palo Alto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Santa Clara County judge to sign the murder warrant . <p> His lawyers were emphatic last night that the police arrested the wrong man . <p> " He was a loving husband , parent and a pillar of the community , " said Daniel Barton , one of the attorneys representing Fitzhugh . " I 'm confident once a complete and unbiased investigation is done Ken Fitzhugh will be exonerated . <p> " No one has suggested any motive why Mr. Fitzhugh would have killed his wife . There is no motive , " Barton continued . <p> But police say Fitzhugh killed his wife of 33 years in the couple 's kitchen two weeks ago . <p> Authorities wo n't give a reason for the slaying , but said anger clearly played a role . <p> They discussed the arrest last night with about 65 neighbors , who had feared the attack was connected to a series of burglaries in the upscale Southgate community . The residents expressed sadness over the tragedy and seemed relieved that the case appeared solved . <p> But some neighbors and school officials responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal couple . <p> " They were just like Ozzie and Harriet , " said Charlie Mae Knight , Superintendent of Ravenswood School District in East Palo Alto , where Kristine Fitzhugh had worked for years . <p> But court documents outlining the evidence describe something more sinister . Detectives say Fitzhugh likely attacked his 53-year-old wife from behind with a blunt object and tried to strangle her with one hand while punching her face with the other . <p> Then , according to police , he moved his dead wife to the foot of the basement stairs , where he positioned her body next to a brass ship bell . <p> " Later he brought friends to the scene so that he would have witnesses to the discovery of his wife 's body , " wrote Detective Mike Denson in an affidavit . " He attempted to mislead investigators by suggesting that the victim had been killed when she fell down the basement stairs and hit her head . " <p> Detectives said that although Kenneth Fitzhugh tried to clean his wife 's blood from the kitchen floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting next to her half-eaten muffin , coffee and music papers . <p> Fitzhugh told police that he and two family friends went looking for his wife at the couple 's home on May 5 , after she failed to show up at Addison Elementary School to teach a music class . They told police they found her lying on the basement floor , and that Fitzhugh attempted to resuscitate her . He told police that he realized his wife was dead while trying to revive her but he continued until emergency personnel arrived . <p> Investigators initially thought she died from an accidental fall down the stairs . But they became suspicious after taking a closer look at the scene . After conducting an autopsy , the Santa Clara coroner 's office deemed that Kristine Fitzhugh 's death was a homicide . <p> Medical examiners determined that she had been struck in the back of the head with a blunt object so forcefully that it fractured her skull . <p> Detectives , finding no signs of forced entry , quickly focused on the husband . They combed the couple 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the search , according to investigators , they found a pair of the husband 's running shoes , a crumpled-up Brooks Brothers shirt and a paper towel  --  all stained with blood  --  in Fitzhugh 's Chevrolet Suburban . <p> In a subsequent interview , Fitzhugh allegedly told police that his wife 's blood may have gotten on his shoes when she cut her left hand a week or two earlier . <p> Furthermore , Fitzhugh said , he was in San Bruno at the time of his wife 's killing  --  estimated some time between 12:08 p.m. and 1:41 p.m.  --  checking out property for a client . No one was able to corroborate his alibi , according to detectives . <p> Fitzhugh said that at 1:15 p.m. he received a call on his cell phone from one of his wife 's co-workers , saying she had n't arrived to teach her afternoon class . Then he drove to the home of two friends in Palo Alto and asked them to come back with him to his house to look for his wife , according to court papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community yesterday , friends remained supportive . <p> " ( Kristine 's ) husband was one of her most ardent supporters , " Knight said . " He worked with the children here and helped us in a number of ways . At our eighth-grade graduation last year , he and Kristine participated . <p> " It is just so distressing , " she continued . " There was no indication of marital problems  --  they were an ideal couple . If it was fake , then he did a good job of hiding it . " <p> Fitzhugh , like his wife , gave free music lessons to disadvantaged children . They both played the piano . Neighbors fondly recalled hearing the instrument being played softly inside while they strolled by the home . The couple , parents of two college-age sons , were well-known in the community for their volunteer work . <p> Fitzhugh , a former contractor , started his own consulting firm in 1993 , which he ran out of his home . Four years later he got his real-estate sales license and helped developers secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the police . <p> The couple 's oldest son , Justin , was scheduled to graduate from California Polytechnic Institute in San Luis Obispo today , Knight said . A banner reading , " Congratulations graduate ! " could be seen through the windows of the couple 's home draped across the hallway . <p> Irv Rollins , assistant superintendent of the Palo Alto Unified School District , said Fitzhugh 's arrest had teachers and students " in a state of shock . " <p> Rollins met late yesterday afternoon with the principals and key staff members of the six elementary schools where Kristine Fitzhugh had taught as part of the district 's team of music teachers to discuss providing psychological counseling " as needed " to students and teachers . <p> Ray McKinney , pastor of St. Luke CME Church in East Palo Alto , said " They were just as loving , every time you saw them . I really felt like they were just the perfect example of what a husband and wife should be . " <p> A next-door neighbor , with tears filling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " before declining to comment further . <p> The couple 's gardener of 20 years was also shocked by the news . He was at their house when a policewoman distributing leaflets in the neighborhood arrived with a flyer announcing Kenneth Fitzhugh 's arrest . <p> " Mr. Fitzhugh is a very nice man , " Tono Kamikihara said . " It must be a mistake . It must be a mistake . "
