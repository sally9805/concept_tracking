<p> SAN FRANCISCO  --  Silicon Valley has asked a question about Facebook : Who will invest in  --  if not own  --  the wildly popular social-networking site ? <p> Microsoft , Google and Yahoo are among the well-heeled suitors generating headlines about their interest in Facebook , a white-hot commodity that has quickly become a major force in social networking . <p> Millions of Americans joined Facebook Nation this summer to " poke " each other , share book favorites and pose questions to their online circle of friends about the latest Britney meltdown . Between Facebook and its rival , MySpace , it seemed the entire country was part of a social network . <p> And others noticed . Last week , there were reports that Microsoft is in preliminary talks with Facebook about a 5% stake  --  worth anywhere from $300 million to $500 million . Google is also reportedly interested in an investment . ( Facebook , Microsoft and Google had no comment . ) Last year , Yahoo and Viacom made bids to buy Facebook . <p> What 's not to like ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young , old and everyone in-between in the USA , industry analysts say . And it 's poised to launch an advertising push that many tech analysts say could be as game-changing as the text-based ads that fueled Google 's meteoric rise . <p> It 's so hot that Facebook 's cherubic CEO and co-founder , Mark Zuckerberg , 23 , is in no hurry to sell any or all of his 3-year-old company . Many analysts speculate Facebook is girding for a blockbuster initial public offering in late 2008 . The company is also mulling raising more than $100 million in cash for acquisitions and expanding its 300-person workforce , say financial analysts . <p> " If ( Facebook ) is not the Big Man on the Internet Campus yet , it 's the handsome frat guy everyone wants to know , " says Debra Aho Williamson , an online-advertising analyst at researcher eMarketer . " There is a feeling that Facebook may be onto something big : It takes Google 's concept of targeted search advertising and goes multiple steps further " by delivering highly tailored ads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , it 's the Internet company of the moment , prompting some analysts to liken it to being the next Google . ( To be fair , it has a ways to go to match Google 's $10.6 billion in revenue last year . ) <p> Facebook could be worth as much as $6 billion today , Bear Stearns analyst Robert Peck says . He expects privately held Facebook to post a profit of about $30 million on revenue of $140 million this year , and register a $70 million profit on revenue of $358 million in 2008 . He predicts $6 billion in revenue by 2016 . <p> PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel , a Facebook board member and its first investor ( $500,000 ) , recently suggested the company is worth as much as $10 billion . <p> " Mark is not focused on selling quickly , " Thiel has said . " Some people get nervous about the boom and the bust and maybe the boom again . Not him . " <p> A prized possession <p> Even by the Valley 's outsize expectations , Facebook is generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child for the power of social networks , personalized websites where individuals share their profiles and interests with friends and business associates . Social networks are used by two-thirds of the estimated 220 million online users in the USA , says Karsten Weide , an analyst at IDC . An estimated 200,000 new folks sign up for Facebook each day . <p> On Facebook , you can easily set up your own Web pages to communicate with friends and business associates ; share photos and videos ; exchange e-mail ; join groups that mirror your personal interests ; and add more than 4,000 applications to play with , such as writing superlatives about your buddies or giving them a virtual poke . <p> In the immediate future , Weide sees Facebook integrating Web-based services and productivity applications such as word processing . " They could become the much-talked-about Web-based operating system of the future  --  not Google , " he says . <p> " It is the one-stop shop for all my social needs , and it 's where all my friends are , " says Kiyoshi Martinez , 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three years . " There 's no reason to leave . " <p> Martinez and millions of others have embraced Facebook and more than dozens of other social-networking sites because of the breadth of offerings and the possibilities of what it can do for them , analysts say . " We think Facebook represents a fundamental , next-generation opportunity on the Internet , " says Jim Breyer , another Facebook board member and Silicon Valley venture capitalist . His firm , Accel Partners , invested $12.5 million in Facebook in April 2005 . <p> Facebook 's influence runs deep because the Internet is at the same stage that the computer operating system was in the mid-1980s , says analyst Peck . The tech company that controls the mechanism for buying and selling ads online will hold remarkable sway over the Internet industry for years to come  --  just as Microsoft did through its Windows operating system . <p> Rivals Microsoft and Google , among others , recognize social networking could be that next crucial mechanism , and Facebook is the ideal vehicle . Google far outpaces Microsoft in online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help shift the balance of power , Peck says . About half of Facebook 's estimated $140 million in revenue comes from an advertising deal with Microsoft , he says . <p> Charles King , principal analyst at market researcher Pund-IT , says Microsoft could tie Facebook members into its advertising business , giving its online services a badly needed shot in the arm . However , it 's unclear how much influence Microsoft would have with just a 5% stake . Facebook conceivably could still do deals with Google , he says . <p> Google may try to trump Microsoft with an investment in Facebook , Peck and others say . Google has shown in the past that it will pay dearly for Internet traffic  --  as witnessed by its $1.7 billion purchase of YouTube last year . And Google will happily outbid others  --  such as Microsoft and Yahoo  --  when faced with competing bids , as it did for YouTube . Or consider Google 's $1 billion stake for 5% of AOL in 2005 , when it also outbid Yahoo and Microsoft . <p> " Facebook could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would require a relationship-juggling act worthy of Cirque du Soleil , " says King . <p> Facebook is being wooed by the tech titans because it enjoys a clear advantage over them in the fledgling social-networking industry , Weide and others say . MSN Spaces is a little-used social network , and Microsoft is interested in either acquiring one or making an investment . Google 's YouTube is a social network designed around video sharing , and Orkut , its 3-year-old social-networking service , seems to be popular only in Brazil . Yahoo has had limited success with Yahoo 360 . Facebook rival LinkedIn only last week gave its 14 million members the ability to add photos to their profiles . <p> " Facebook is special , " says Josh Bernoff of Forrester Research . " Taken together , its 40 million-plus active members , the explosion of Facebook-specific applications and its rich detail about customers lend it an unprecedented dynamic . " <p> Facing some obstacles <p> Despite its heady prospects , Facebook faces inevitable challenges as it expands aggressively and benefits from being Silicon Valley 's " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vastly overvalued . " It may be the benefactor  --  and victim  --  of hype , " says Trip Chowdhry , an analyst at Global Equities Research . <p> Chowdhry has doubts about the staying power of broad social networks such as Facebook . He points out that Facebook is made up largely of former MySpace patrons , and he predicts the Next Big Thing could be micro social-networking sites that cater to folks that share specific interests such as hip-hop music or surfing . " Social networks are fads , " Chowdhry says . " People are moving targets . " <p> Chamath Palihapitiya , vice president of product marketing and operations at Facebook , envisions Facebook as the underlying technology platform that serves as a communications hub among specialized social networks . <p> " Our potential is to create a utility so essential that we connect everyone in the world , " he says . " With nearly 6 billion in the world , that 's very humbling . We 've taken the first few steps in a very long path . " <p> Still , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook to keep workers from spending too much time on the site . Facebook 's new ad platform has stirred privacy anxieties among some customers . And it confronts similar criticisms to MySpace that it attracts sexual predators . <p> New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is pressing forward with a month-long investigation into the availability of pornographic material on Facebook and how the company responds to user complaints about pedophiles who solicit minors . Last week , Cuomo 's office subpoenaed Facebook for information . <p> Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is overseeing a similar , unrelated investigation . Facebook says it is cooperating with both attorneys general . <p> What is more , Facebook is preparing a major new advertising plan for later this year that would let marketers tailor ads . The new format may display more prominent ads on the news feed  --  a list of updates on the activities of a user 's Facebook friends . Facebook ads also currently appear as banners on the left and bottom borders of Facebook pages . ( MySpace has started testing targeted ads in the past few months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more personalized ads without ( angering ) users , " analyst Bernoff says . <p> Meanwhile , others question whether Facebook will be able to translate its popularity into Google-size profits . " How much do Facebook users pay attention to ads ? " asks analyst Williamson says . " They may not be as attentive as those who conduct Web searches . " <p> But such challenges could be mere potholes for Zuckerberg , one of Facebook 's largest shareholders and chairman of its three-member board . <p> With mega offers rolling in every few months , he is at the center of high-tech 's Next Big Thing . <p> Contributing : Byron Acohido in Seattle , Jefferson Graham in Los Angeles <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
