It seemed as if the campaign had never ended . There was John Kerry standing on a chair in a blue neighborhood of Atlanta , in the Democrat-friendly tavern Manuel 's , speaking to 100 folks , many of them wearing Kerry-Edwards T shirts . The Massachusetts Senator insisted that he was n't " one to lick wounds , " but then he did : he noted that Bush had won with the smallest percentage margin ever for an incumbent and complained that the Republican team had six years to develop its electoral strategy while his had only eight months . And although he claimed that " my focus is not four years from now , " he made sure his audience knew just how viable a candidate he had been  --  and could be again . " We actually won in the battleground states , " Kerry said , adding that his loss in Ohio was so close that if " half the people ... at an Ohio State football game " had voted differently , he would be in the Oval Office now . <P> Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2004 , was merely a detour on his road to the White House . He has been holding private dinners with potential fund raisers and policy advisers , signaling he might run again and blaming his political strategists for many of the mistakes his campaign made last year , such as not responding swiftly to ads attacking his Vietnam service . He has set up a political-action committee to finance his travels around the country , which will include stops in 20 cities over the next two months to give speeches and headline fund raisers for other Democrats . And he is constantly e-mailing his list of more than 3 million supporters to promote causes he championed as a candidate , like expanding health insurance to all children and preventing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . Kerry plans to write a book on his views on national security . <P> Besides stumping and writing , Kerry is hoping to curry favor within the party by donating some of the $14 million left over from his campaign fund . He offered a vote of confidence to former rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean took over as chairman . He donated $250,000 to the recount effort of Christine Gregoire , who eventually won a very close Governor 's race in Washington . Venturing into local politics , he will probably endorse Antonio Villaraigosa in a runoff election for mayor in L.A. , choosing a loyal supporter over incumbent James Hahn . " He gets to travel and gets to pick up IOUs , " says former party chairman Steve Grossman , a Boston fund raiser who served as Dean 's campaign chairman .
