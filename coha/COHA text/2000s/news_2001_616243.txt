<p> The scene comes back to Mike Helton like a bad dream . <p> He 's standing in a waiting room at Halifax Medical Center in Daytona . It 's Sunday evening , Feb. 18 . He 's praying for a miracle . <p> But it was n't a dream that day , and there would be no miracle . <p> Helton was with his mentor , NASCAR chairman Bill France , and France 's daughter , Lesa Kennedy , when word came from the emergency room : " We 've done all we could . " <p> The group was stunned . But Helton knew that as president of NASCAR there were things he had to do . He returned to Daytona International Speedway , stood in front of a bank of microphones and spoke the words that everyone expected , but no one wanted to hear . <p> " We have lost Dale Earnhardt , " Helton said . <p> He told the assembled media that NASCAR had lost one of its greatest superstars on the final lap of the Daytona 500 . <p> He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his greatest friends . <p> The controversy and endless questions surrounding NASCAR 's investigation into Earnhardt 's death have aged Helton during the past three months . <p> Professionally , he 's in the middle of the storm . Personally , he 's trying to come to grips with the loss of a close friend and a relationship that spanned 22 years . <p> Helton looks weary . His eyes are strained . He looks like a man going through the motions . <p> " I 've had some sleepless nights , " Helton said during an interview at his Georgia farm . " Not from the professional side , because I believe in my heart and soul that NASCAR is a great organization and the France family is the staple of honesty and integrity . And Richard Childress and Teresa Earnhardt know that better than anybody . <p> " The restless nights come from the controversy , and the challenges and the attempts at finger-pointing and the enormity of it all . " <p> Since Earnhardt 's death , there has been a steady stream of controversies involving broken seatbelts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASCAR announced April 9 that it would bring in an outside group of experts to recreate Earnhardt 's crash . The group is hard at work . Helton says he has no doubt that all questions will be answered when the organization releases its report in August . <p> In the meantime , he 's prepared to take a beating from the media . But it upset him that his friend 's death has become a spectacle . <p> " Sometimes I have to step back and collect myself when some of these accusations are made , " he said . " I have to stop and get through the personal emotion of wishing I did n't have to deal with the carnival-like part of all of this , because I had so much respect for Dale as a person . <p> " Do n't these people know he was a hero as much to the business side of this sport as he was to the fans ? Do n't these people know that we loved the man and cared for him and respected him as much as anybody else did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside and go back to the professional side of dealing with such an enormous issue . <p> " That part makes me angry . " <p> Like many executives in similar positions , Helton is a hard person to get to know , especially for the people who work under him and his rules . But it was different with Earnhardt . <p> Jim Hunter , a long-time NASCAR official , said no other driver knew Helton the way Earnhardt did . <p> " Mike is not close to many people outside his family because of his position , " Hunter said . " But Dale Earnhardt cracked through that natural barrier that 's always there . " <p> And Helton was able to connect with Earnhardt in ways that many others never did . " There was a mutual respect that was very unusual , " Hunter said . <p> Among the things Helton misses most are the wake-up calls from the Intimidator . <p> " When my phone rang between 6 and 6:30 in the morning , it was either Bill France or Dale Earnhardt , " Helton said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd get up and get to thinking about something , and he 'd call up and want to talk about it . " <p> Helton said that after a while Earnhardt did n't even bother to identify himself . " I 'd pick up the phone and he 'd say , ' What are you doing ? ' and you knew right then who it was . " <p> Their conversations , sometimes as many as seven a week , often were about racing . A lot of times they were n't . <p> " We talked about everything , I mean everything , " Helton said . " We talked about different people , likes and dislikes , dreams and wishes , hunting and fishing . <p> " He really got excited about Dale Jr. , and about hunting and fishing trips he was getting ready to go on . " <p> Earnhardt also liked to talk about his wife , Teresa , and his daughter , Taylor . <p> " He was really happy with Teresa and Taylor and proud of what Taylor was doing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and explaining why he felt good about them . " <p> They also talked about their love of the land , and the enjoyment that comes with creating your own personal paradise . Earnhardt encouraged Helton to buy a farm in Georgia and occasionally visited him there . <p> " Dale and Richard ( Childress ) had been there about a half-dozen times up to the time we lost him , " Helton said . " It would have been countless times . " <p> Helton also visited Earnhardt 's farm in North Carolina as often as he could . " We shared so many of the same likes , " he said . " We enjoyed the freedom that comes with having your own territory , your own turf , being able to be in charge of your own environment and owning wide-open spaces so that you could stand outside and scream if you wanted to . " <p> The two first met in 1979 , when Earnhardt was a Winston Cup rookie and Helton was a reporter at a radio station in Bristol , Tenn . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed Dale before a race at Bristol , " Helton said . <p> A few weeks later , he traveled to a race in Nashville and again met Earnhardt . Helton had shaved off his beard between races . <p> " I talked to him again about the successes he 'd had in his rookie season , coming on like gangbusters , " Helton said . After the interview was over , Helton and then-Nashville track president Ed Clark , now president of Atlanta Motor Speedway , continued talking with Earnhardt . <p> " This was only the second time I 'd ever met the guy  --  the first was just a 15-minute interview  --  and Dale said , ' When did you shave your beard off ? ' " Helton said . " I did n't think he 'd remember me or even care who I was , but that 's the kind of person Dale was . " <p> Helton said Earnhardt was just as talented , and worked just as hard , at making friends as he did winning races . <p> " If chemistry makes a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " He had the ability to make you feel like you were something special . " <p> But they also had a serious business relationship : Helton made the Winston Cup rules , and Earnhardt raced under those rules . And Earnhardt often complained loudly about them . <p> " We had some pretty good wars professionally that we had to work through over the last few years , " Helton said . " He was a guy you could warm up to and enjoy being with . And you could get mad as all get-out with him , but he could come back and get you right back into that feel-good side of him . " <p> Earnhardt seemed to be able to tell when Helton was having a particularly difficult time . <p> " There are a lot of ups and downs in this business , " Helton said . " Dale was quick to pick up on it when you were under the gun , and he was also quick to pick up on when he created it . <p> " Dale would argue strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back and say , ' You 've got to do what you 've got to do , and I understand that so do n't let this mess us up personally , but dadgumit . . . ' " <p> The most tense moment in their relationship came when Earnhardt spun Terry Labonte out of the way on the final lap to win at Bristol in 1999 . <p> " That was a tough deal , " Helton said . " Somebody has to make a judgment call , and you do n't want to make decisions on the last lap that make drivers afraid to race with each other . But still you would have preferred that that not happen . " <p> No penalties were levied against Earnhardt , but Helton said he made it clear to him that he did n't think wrecking Labonte was the right way to win a race . And the two did n't talk as friends about Bristol for several weeks . <p> " Dale was good at the timing of things , and he knew we were n't going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it all got corrected professionally , " Helton said . <p> Helton and Earnhardt saw each other several times in the weeks leading up to the 2001 Daytona 500 . Earnhardt was upbeat about his chances of winning the race and proud of the three teams he owned . He was particularly pleased to have been able to provide a strong car for his friend Michael Waltrip , the eventual winner . <p> On Feb. 18 , in the hours before the 500 , the two friends had their last conversation . <p> " It was before the driver 's meeting , " Helton said . " Dale felt good , felt like he had a chance to win the Daytona 500 again . It ended with him talking about being around late Sunday evening because he 'd have to stay around to put his ( winning ) car in Daytona USA . It was a pleasant conversation to remember . " <p> Until all the questions about Earnhardt 's death are answered , Helton will continue to face a professional and personal juggling act . <p> It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's car slammed into the wall , Helton knew from experience that it was a bad wreck . <p> " I was holding out on making any conclusions , but I was pretty quick to figure out that it was n't going to be good , " he said . " I was holding out hope , and I was n't going to make any conclusion until I had to . " <p> When the doctors confirmed that his friend was dead , Helton was forced to put his personal feelings aside . <p> " That evening , I knew what had happened , and I understood what had happened , but there were things to be done , people to be taken care of , " Helton said . " I kind of went down that road , staying busy for a period of time . . . . It was a few weeks before it really hit me . " <p> Time has been short , but Helton is learning to deal with the loss . <p> " Every time I started feeling really bad about it or really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think of Teresa , and think that if I feel this way , what 's Richard ( Childress ) thinking ? " Helton said . " And Teresa has got to be the person that has lost the most . <p> " We 've all lost a friend .
