No shoes . No service . No problem . Ditch restaurant crowds , and kick back with your family . Photograph // Noon probably is n't the hour you normally think about being in your summer garden . But under the shade of a tree or beneath a patio umbrella , your yard can be a glorious place to take a break . When the weather is nice , I make it a habit to go home for lunch at least twice a week to get away from the daily grind at the office . Similar to Nick Patterson 's morning walk-about ( page 84 ) , I call this time my " thinkabout . " Before Aimee and I had children , I 'd sneak home for a ham-and-cheese sandwich with my Brittany spaniel , Lacy , and read the mail , look over my yard , and think about what my next project might be . It 's really not exercise , but it 's my quiet mental-health time to reflect on my garden , to create a to-do list in my head , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A grouping of shade trees can create dappled light in my garden , below : Planting a magnolia will add a beautiful scent that wit ! perfume the air . bottom : Add a swing to your yard , and pur cares will fly away . // These days , I do n't often get much quiet time , but going home continues to play an important role in my routine . 1 still eat ham-and-cheese sandwiches , and Lacy still sits at my feet , but now I have lunch with Ben ( almost 3-years old , as he 'll tell you ) , Margo ( 8 months ) , and Aimee . We use the time to see what everyone is up to ; Ben may be running around like a wild man , or Margo may have just rolled over for the first time . I look forward to eating outside with my family every bit as much as I used to look forward to the time alone . You might ask , " What about the thinkabout ?

While it 's not very strenuous exercise for me , Ben gets to run around and use up some energy before his afternoon nap . It 's certainly a tradition 1 look forward to continuing as Margo grows up . If work takes you too far from home to return for a lunch break , try finding your own spot close to the of-rice , such as a park or a sidewalk cafe . You may not be able to walk around your garden or see your family ( although with planning , perhaps some days they can meet you ) , but you 'll be able to think about things that you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savor fresh air .

They provide shade for a hot day , a low branch for attaching a swing , or even delicious fruit to eat . More and more , however , trees are losing a battle with progress . Luckily , they are a renewable resource everyone can easily add to their own yards . Summer is not the ideal time to add a tree to your yard , but it can be done . To ensure a newly planted tree stands up to the hot days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't go through as much shock as a balled-and-burlapped one . When selecting a tree , pick one that looks healthy and has good foliage . Do n't buy one with roots protruding out of the bottom of its container , that has dead twigs or branches , or looks too big for the container . The key to planting success in the summer is making sure your tree stays watered . As you plant it , form a berm of soil around the tree to create a watering moat . Water slowly to fill the moat . The liquid should n't overflow but fill it ; then let it soak into the soil . You should water daily for the first couple of weeks , then as often as needed to keep the top 3 or 4 inches of the soil damp . // <p>
