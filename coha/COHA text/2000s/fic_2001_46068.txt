MERLIN HAS COME AGAIN , down to where the light has gone and there is only darkness . Darkness and pressure , here where the water is as cold and hard as steel . He is bright himself , so bright that he hurts my eyes and I must lid them and turn away . Merlin uses that brightness , knowing that I can not bear it , nor bear him seeing the creature I have become . <p> That is his strength , and it is the reason I will ultimately give him what he wants . For Merlin has power , and only he can give me what I need . He knows that , but as in any negotiation , he does not know at which point he will win . For I have two things that he seeks , and he has only the price of one . <p> I think he will choose Excalibur , for even he finds it difficult to think down here , under the lake . We can both see the strands of time that unravel from this choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I in this darkness . He will choose the sword for his Arthur , when he could have the grail . <p> I admit the sword seems more readily useful . With the scabbard , of course . But Merlin 's sight does not see behind , only forward , and what he has learned of the sword is only a small part of the story . <p> If he chose to be less blinding , I might tell him more . But the light is cruel , and I do not care to prolong our conversation . I will merely cast my own mind back , while he talks . It is as effective a means as any to avoid the spell he weaves so cleverly behind his words . Only Merlin would seek to gull me so , even though he should know better . Let him talk , and I will send his spell back . Back into time , when I walked under the sun , in the land that was called Lyonnesse . <p> Back into time , when the barbarians first landed on Lyonnesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begging for a weapon that would save them . They had no fear of me in those days , for I had long held a woman 's shape , and I had never broken the agreement I made with their ancestors long ago . Not that they ever sought me out in times of peace and plenty , for they also remembered that I did nothing without exacting a price . <p> As I did when they asked me to make a sword , a sword that could make a hero out of a husbandman , a warrior of an aleswiller , a savior from a swineherd . A sword that would give its wielder the strength of the snowfed river Fleer , the speed of the swifts that flew around my hill , and the endurance of the great stone that sat upon my hill . <p> They were afraid of the barbarians , so they paid the price . A hundred maidens who came to my cold stone door , thinking they would live to serve me in some palace of arching caverns underearth . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their years I supped upon to feed my own , and their blood I used to quench the sword . I still thought of humans as I thought of other animals then , and felt nothing for their tears and cries . I did not realize that as I bound the power of river , swifts and stone into the metal , I also filled the sword with sorrow and the despair of death . <p> They called the sword Excalibur , and it seemed everything they had asked . It took many months before they discovered it was both more and less . It was used by several men against the barbarians , and delivered great victories . But in every battle , the wielder was struck with a battle madness , a melancholy that would drive him alone into the midst of the enemy . All would be strong and swift and untiring , but eventually they would always be struck down by weight of numbers , or number of wounds . <p> The people came to me again , and demanded that I mend the madness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the sword could be used to its full effect . They argued that I had not fulfilled the bargain and would pay no more . <p> But I sat silent in my hill , the barbarians still came in their thousands , and there were few who dared to wield Excalibur , knowing that they would surely die . <p> So they brought the two hundred youths I had demanded . Some even came gladly , thinking they would meet their sweethearts who had gone before . This time , I was more careful , taking their futures from them without warning , so there was no time for pain , despair or sadness . From their hair I wove the scabbard that would give the wearer a hundred lives between dawn of one day and dawn the next . <p> I knew nothing of human love then , or I would have demanded still younger boys , who had no knowledge of the girls who came to my hill the year before . The scabbard did make the bearer proof against a multiplicity of wounds , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover , refusing to let go . Only a man of great will could draw the sword , or a sorcerer , and there were few of those in Lyonnesse , for I disliked their kind . Many a would-be hero died with Excalibur still sheathed upon his belt . Even a hundred lives is not enough against a hundred hundred wounds . <p> Each time , the sword and scabbard came back to me , drawn to the place of their making . Each time I returned them to the good folk of Lyonnesse , as they continued their largely losing war against the barbarians . Not that I cared who won one way or another , save for tidiness and a certain sense of tradition . <p> Many people came to me in those times of war , foolishly ignoring the pact that spoke of the days and seasons when I would listen and spare their lives . Consuming them , I learned more of humanity , and more of the magic that lurked within their brief lives . It became a study for me , and I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew . Soon , it was mostly barbarians I learned from , for the local folk resumed the practice of binding rowan twigs in their hair , and they remembered not to walk in moonlight . Once again children were given small silver coins to wear as earrings . Some nights I gathered many blood-dappled coins , but garnered neither lives nor knowledge . <p> In time the barbarians learned too , and so it was that a deputation came to me one cold Midwinter Day , between noon and the setting of the sun . It was composed of the native folk I knew so well , and barbarians , joined together in common purpose . They wanted me to enforce a peace upon the whole land of Lyonnesse , so that no man could make war upon another . <p> The price they were prepared to pay was staggering , so many lives that I would barely need to feed again for a thousand years . Given my new curiosity about humankind , the goal was also fascinating , because for the first time in my long existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They paid the price , and for seven days , a line of men , women and children wound its way into my hill . I had learned a little , for this third time , so I gave them food and wine and smoke that made them sleep . Then as they slept , I harvested their dreams , even as I walked among them and drank their breath . <p> The dreams I took in a net of light , down through the earth to where the rocks themselves were fire , and there I made the Grail . A thing of such beauty and of such hope began to form that I forgot myself in the wonder of creation , and poured some of my dreams in it too , and a great part of my power . <p> Perhaps some of my memory went in the making of the Grail , because I had forgotten what my power meant to the land of Lyonnesse . All that long climb back from the depths of the earth I gazed at what I had made , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down there the earth was never still . I did not realize that its mutterings were following me back into the light . <p> I emerged from my hill to find the deputation gone , panicked by the ground that shook and roared beneath them . I held the grail aloft , and shouted that it would bring peace to all who drank from it . But even as I spoke , I saw the horizon lift up like a folded cloth , and the blue of the sky was lost in the terrible darkness of the sea . The sea , rising up higher than my hill or the mountains behind , a vast and implacable wave that seemed impossible - till I realized that it was not the sea that rose , but Lyonnesse that fell . And I remembered . <p> Long ago , long ago , I had shored up the very foundations of the land . Now , in my making of the Grail , I had tom away the props . Lyonnesse would drown , but I would not drown with it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grail clutched in my talons . Or rather , I tried to . My wings beat in a frenzy , but the Grail would not move . I tried to let it go , but could not , and still the wave came on , till it blocked out the very sun and it was too late to be flying anywhere . <p> It was then I knew that the Grail brought not only peace , but judgment . I had filled it with the dreams of a thousand folk , dreams of peace and justice . But I had let other dreams creep in , and one of those was a dream that the white demon that preyed upon them in the moonlit nights would be punished for the deaths she wrought , and the fear she had brought upon the people . <p> The wave came upon me as I changed back to human shape , crushing me beneath a mountain wall of water , picking me up , Grail and all , for a journey without air and light that crossed the width of Lyonnesse before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my human form beyond repair . I took another shape , the best I could make , though it was not pleasing to mine or any other eyes . It is a measure of the Grail 's mercy that this seemed sufficient punishment , for only then could I let it fall . <p> I did let it go , but never from my sight . For now , even waking , I dreamed of all the folk of Lyonnesse who died under the wave , and only the Grail would give me untroubled rest . Years passed , and I slithered from sea to river to lake , till at last I came here , following the drifts and tumblings of the Grail . I was not surprised to find that Excalibur awaited me , still sheathed and shining , despite its long sojourn in the deep . It seemed fitting that everything I made should lie together , both the things and the fate . Even the Grail seemed content to sit , as if waiting for the future I could not see . <p> I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so strange , given our birthing together so long ago . He has studied humanity with greater care than I , and used his power with much more caution . <p> There ! I have left his spell behind with my drowned past , and now we shall bargain in earnest . He will give me back my human shape , he says , in return for the sword . He knows it is an offer I can not refuse . What is the sword to me , compared to the warmth of the sun on my soft skin , the colors that my eyes will see anew , the cool wind that will caress my face ? <p> I will give him the sword . It will bring Arthur triumph , but also sorrow , as it has always done , for his victories will never be his own . The scabbard too , will save him and doom him , for a man who can not be wounded is not a man that a woman can choose to love . <p> Merlin is clever . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I must give it up to Arthur . Only then will I receive my side of the bargain . It is curious to feel expectation again , and something that I must define as hope . <p> Even the brightness seems less wearing on my eyes , or perhaps it is Merlin who has chosen to be kind . Yes , now he talks of the Grail , and asks me to give it up . Merlin does not understand its nature , I think , or he would not be trying to get it for himself . <p> The Grail will wait , I tell him . Go and fetch your King , your Arthur . I will give him the sword , the scabbard too , and may he use them well . <p> Merlin knows when to wait . He has always been good at waiting . He leaps upward in a flurry of light and I slide back into my cave , to coil around the hollow that contains my treasures . The Grail was there yesterday , but not now . If I thought Merlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would pursue him , up into the warmer , lighter waters , to see if his power is as great as what remains of mine . <p> But I will not , for I know the Grail has left me without Merlin 's tricks or thievery , as it has left a thousand times before . I have always followed it in the past , seeking the relief it gave . Now I think time has served that same purpose , if not so well . Time and cold and depth . It slows thought , and dulls memory . Only Merlin 's coming has briefly woken me at all , I realize , and there lies the irony of our exchange . <p> I will give the sword to Arthur , but without the Grail I do not think I will long remain in human shape . The Grail taught me guilt , but it also drank it up . Without it , I shall have to think too much and remember too much . I will have to live with a light that blinds me , until at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lie within my gut . <p> No . The Grail has gone . When Excalibur is likewise gone , I shall return to the darkness and the cold , to this place where a dull serpent can sleep without dreaming . Till once again I must obey the call of strength and sorrow , of love and longing , of justice and of peace . All these things of human magic , that I never knew till I made the sword and scabbard , and never understood until I made the Grail . <p> Author Affiliation
