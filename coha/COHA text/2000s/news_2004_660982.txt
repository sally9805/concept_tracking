<p> Orange County , N.Y. , is where most of North America 's onion crop is grown . But the local economy is shaky , so county executives want to expand and diversify without losing their agricultural base . The question is : How can they maintain their rural appeal while luring new businesses and additional residents to the area ? <p> Five hundred miles away in Anne Arundel County , Maryland , constituents are facing a similar problem . How can they get an influx of new capital without compromising their open lands ? <p> Farther south , the center of Port Gibson , Miss. , ( pop . 1,800 ) has been virtually abandoned as businesses struggle to survive encroachment by nearby " big box " stores . <p> Towns all over the country - in fact , throughout the industrial world - are facing similar struggles as the social landscape shifts . Strip malls and mass merchants multiply , leaving traditional downtowns abandoned . Owners of farms with low ( or no ) profits are tempted to sell out to realtors . <p> One group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1987 , it has addressed the issues of reduced agriculture and increased urban sprawl in 110 communities across North America . The group , a nonprofit arm of Glynwood Center in Cold Spring , N.Y. , brings together experienced international teams of volunteer professionals to work with community representatives . Their goal is to improve the local economy without losing rural appeal - pristine forests , open land , or clear-running trout streams . <p> " We 've found that the reason folks choose to live in small communities is because of the open land , " says Judith LaBelle , president of Glynwood Center . " Any advice we give concerning community growth has to preserve that . " <p> When community leaders approach the exchange , often they know they want to revitalize but are at a loss as to where to start . <p> So the exchange first tries to determine if it can have an impact . It considers similar communities where it has done work and then looks at the assets of the town and neighboring communities ( landmarks , thriving businesses , agricultural potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seek is an undeveloped strength - perhaps a historic cohesiveness in the center-city architecture , an unrecognized tourist site , or proximity to cul- tural events . ( Anything that can be exploited for the good of the community . ) <p> Next , the exchange looks for funding to support the town 's improvement efforts . For example , a village on New York 's Hudson River may be eligible for Historic Waterways money . Or , as was the case in Port Gibson , the National Park Service had funds available for the preservation of neglected Civil War battlefields . <p> " What we try to do , " says Ms. LaBelle , " is find key issues and focus on three or four . The initial grant covers our cost of research , travel , and administration on average , around $ 60,000 , and the preliminary development of a primary asset that can be the anchor to move the community forward . " <p> Help is on the way <p> Once funding is in place , the exchange sets an agenda and selects a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to share their expertise . <p> Past exchanges have drawn on the talents of Cheryl Brine , for example , an economic development consultant for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture , Food , and Rural Affairs . Her specialty is helping municipalities recruit new businesses . Another alumnus is Pete Frost , a community action officer in the Countryside Council for Wales . His area of expertise is conserving the aesthetic quality of the landscape and preserving diversity and richness of wildlife . <p> The team , chosen from a network of enthusiastic volunteers ( 800 have participated to date ) , then makes a seven-day visit to the town , during which members focus on how to confront and overcome the community 's problems . <p> But they do n't do it alone . <p> The exchange always works with a local organizing committee ( LOC ) , a " spokesgroup " for the town made up of people from all walks of life - perhaps clergy and forest rangers , labor leaders and teenagers . Before the team visits , the LOC submits information that identifies the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the exchange team finally travels to the site , the LOC helps it meet with various groups and study the issues in-depth.Sometimes this means talking with people over a plate of chicken at a potluck supper . <p> But no matter what the setting , the visiting experts spend much time listening to what townspeople have to say . A typical day 's agenda may include separate meetings with pastors , realtors and developers , police and emergency-services officials , and the public works department . There might also be a trip to a local school to talk to students and an economic development meeting with the Chamber of Commerce . <p> Each meeting may include hundreds of questions and answers . The more enthusiasm the visitors can generate , the more active community groups will be once they leave . <p> At the end of the week-long visit , the exchange leaves a thick book of recommendations . This detailed report , which can contain as many as 100 specific suggestions , becomes the town 's " bible , " the idea pool to build its future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Northern Dutchess ( N.Y. ) Alliance , it included 14 suggestions for addressing public concerns about developers destroying historic or picturesque countryside . <p> A top suggestion was to be proactive about development rather than reactive by creating " shovel ready " sites where all the regulatory and fiscal requirements for a proposed development are established and ready for an appropriate developer . <p> Another tip : Draft zoning ordinances that promote growth in village centers - thus protecting gateways to villages and the surrounding countryside . <p> " We always recommend setting some priorities , " says LaBelle about the exchange report . " Start with some easier things that can be accomplished quickly . This will keep the enthusiasm level high and give community members a sense of accomplishment . " <p> The hard work finally pays off <p> Each recommendationthat 's achieved is progress and , over time ( often as little as a few months ) , towns notice improvement - more traffic downtown , more revenue at lunch counters , more activity at real estate offices . <p> But because tougher issues take longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain available to give advice and clarification long after the volunteers have gone . If necessary , they can even provideseminars , for a price . For townspeople who may be implementing suggestions years after the fact , this continued support is crucial . <p> " We 've been working on executing the Countryside exchange recommendations for almost eight years , " says Al Hollingsworth , a Port Gibson community activist . " We started out working on fairly simple suggestions - like making a list of local restaurants that will accept bus tours to the battlefield . Then we had to make repairs to a couple of downtown buildings before they could be sold revitalizing the center city . That took a lot longer . Now renovation of the key building at the battlefield has almost been completed . Between applying for additional grants and raising matching funds both suggestions from the report the town has been steadily improving . " <p> For Port Gibson , the hard work has paid off . The town , which was declining at one point , now boasts a 90 percent occupancy rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an arts organization . Local officials expect this will diversify and multiply the visitors coming into town . <p> " One of my favorite stories , " says the exchange 's LaBelle , " goes back to a community we worked with a few years ago . At an annual event , we met this man named Ted who ran the haberdashery . He said , ' My favorite thing about this Exchange program is , people used to come into my store and say , ' Ai n't nothin ' ever happenin ' here . Nothin ' ever will . ' Now , no one says that anymore . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
