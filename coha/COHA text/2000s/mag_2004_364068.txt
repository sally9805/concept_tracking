Put yourself in William Patrick 's soggy shoes for a moment . When the Texas-born writer bought a 1677 farmhouse in Ipswich , Mass. , two years ago , the neighborhood 's thriving beaver colony seemed part of its charm . Since then the beavers have been busy damming everything that flows . Now two of Patrick 's four acres  --  farmland for three centuries  --  are underwater , and towering pines next to the house have begun crashing to earth . " The beavers are turning our whole yard into a swamp , " fumes Patrick , 52 . " They 're not smart . They 're obsessive-compulsive . They hear water , and they have to dam it . " <P> Once driven nearly to extinction by rampant fur trapping and forest clearing , beavers are colonizing large swaths of North America where people do n't remember seeing them . Since Massachusetts banned lethal leg-hold traps in 1996 , the state 's beaver population has tripled , to 70,000 . North Carolina may have half a million , Manitoba twice as many . From Maine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers are exploding . <P> So too are complaints from property owners , many of them ardent environmentalists who like beavers in principle but not necessarily in their backyards . They know that beavers help create wetlands , those ecologically vital landscapes that Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Leavitt calls " nature 's kidneys . " But , like hiring Hell 's Angels to work security , relying on the continent 's chubbiest rodents to put your landscape in order is not always a good idea . <P> If you 're standing in beaver territory , you had better be wearing hip boots . An ungainly waddler ashore , Castor canadensis spends 80% of its life in water , where it 's as agile as a 50-lb. minnow . Dam building is its way of making the world a wetter , safer and more convenient place . Only humans alter their environment more drastically . <P> But humans are n't aquatic . Most of us , in fact , wish the world were dryer , not wetter , and flooding tops the list of human grievances against the beaver . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can flood basements , swamp sewer systems , spoil trout streams and even derail trains . <P> Complaint No. 2 is the beaver 's maniacal devotion to felling trees , which provide it with food and building material . An adult can gnaw through a tree six inches in diameter in 15 minutes . In the Southeast , beavers cause millions of dollars of damage to timber forests every year . In 1999 a squad of bucktoothed renegades in Washington started toppling cherry trees along the Tidal Basin , putting at risk the annual Cherry Blossom Festival . ( When the National Park Service relocated the colony to an undisclosed location , then Idaho Congresswoman Helen Chenoweth , a die-hard foe of reintroducing the wolf and grizzly in the West , demanded the Tidal Basin be declared " habitat critical to its well-being and survival " and the return of the beavers. )
