When the leaders of two snarling nations are personally committed to better ties , why is that so hard to accomplish ? On the surface , a long list of differences separate Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf . One is devoted to Hindu nationalism , the other to a strong Muslim nation . One governs the world 's most populous democracy , the other rules by diktat . India 's leader is 20 years older and the frail veteran of 47 years in politics ; Pakistan 's is a fit career soldier whose political life began just two years ago in a military coup . Vajpayee is a master orator given to flights of poetry ; Musharraf is a plainspoken man with a blunt , forthright style . The first has succeeded by adroitly sidestepping conflict and finessing confrontation , the second by cutting straight to the core of a problem . <P> Yet Vajpayee and Musharraf ought to be able to do business together . Both are the moderate face of their hard-line constituencies and liberals in their private lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared nuclear arsenals . And each came to power proclaiming the same grand ambition : to bring peace to a subcontinent torn by futile hostility since it was partitioned into a mainly Hindu country and a mainly Muslim one in 1947 . <P> They have tried before . Last July , at a summit in the northern Indian city of Agra , the two leaders looked ready to achieve a historic meeting of minds . The determined general and the affable poet-politician practically embraced as they showered each other with compliments . Vajpayee called Musharraf a " distinguished son of Delhi " ( where he was born ) , and the Pakistani leader dubbed his counterpart India 's " graceful elder . " They parleyed in private for hours while aides anxiously waited outside the door . But the bonhomie ran aground on Kashmir when they could not agree even on whether to call it a " dispute , " as Musharraf demanded , or an " issue , " as Vajpayee insisted . The summit collapsed . When Musharraf baldly spilled his position to the Indian press before departing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bitter aftertaste . <P> The general was , of course , the same man who had spoiled Vajpayee 's previous peace initiative toward Pakistan . In early 1999 , while Vajpayee and democratically elected President Nawaz Sharif were initialing a new chapter in bilateral relations in Lahore , Musharraf , then chief of the Pakistani armed forces , was orchestrating a daring incursion into Kashmir , into the Indian-held Kargil Heights . That provoked six weeks of bloody combat , cutting dead Vajpayee 's cherished Lahore process . <P> Sept. 11 cast another shadow over the relationship . Vajpayee had been enjoying the glow of a growing friendship with the U.S. Washington liked the way he reined in his party 's hotheads and diluted its hard-line agenda , and admired his skill at holding together his fractious coalition for an unprecedented three years . He had almost persuaded the U.S. to blacklist Pakistan as a terrorist state for supporting the Kashmir jihadis , while practicing admirable restraint by not retaliating directly against Pakistan .                @ @ @ @ @
