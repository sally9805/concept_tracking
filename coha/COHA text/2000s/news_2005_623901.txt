<p> Evangelical Christian pastor Jerry Falwell has a message for Americans when it comes to celebrating Christmas this year : You 're either with us , or you 're against us . <p> Falwell has put the power of his 24,000-member congregation behind the " Friend or Foe Christmas Campaign , " an effort led by the conservative legal organization Liberty Counsel . The group promises to file suit against anyone who spreads what it sees as misinformation about how Christmas can be celebrated in schools and public spaces . <p> The 8,000 members of the Christian Educators Association International will be the campaign 's " eyes and ears " in the nation 's public schools . They 'll be reporting to 750 Liberty Counsel lawyers who are ready to pounce if , for example , a teacher is muzzled from leading the third-graders in " Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing . " <p> An additional 800 attorneys from another conservative legal group , the Alliance Defense Fund , are standing by as part of a similar effort , the Christmas Project . Its slogan : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Fanning the Yule log of discontent against what the Liberty Counsel calls " grinches " like the American Civil Liberties Union are evangelical-led organizations including the 150,000-member American Family Association . It has called for a boycott of Target stores next weekend . The chain 's crime , according to the group , is a ban on the use of " Merry Christmas " in stores , an accusation the chain denies . <p> On his show last week , Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly offered a list of other retailers that he says refuse to use " Merry Christmas " in their store advertising . <p> In signing on to " Friend or Foe " this month , Falwell urged the 500,000 recipients of his weekly " Falwell Confidential " e-mail to " draw a line in the sand and resist bullying tactics of the ACLU and others who intimidate school and government officials by spreading misinformation about Christmas . " <p> Standing on the other side of that sand line are religious , liberal and secular organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League , whose national director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Christianize " America . <p> " This amped-up effort shows how these groups want to push into the classrooms more , " said Tami Holzman , assistant director of the Anti-Defamation League 's San Francisco office . <p> " There is no war against Christmas , " said Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State . " There is no jihad against Christians . There is nothing going on around Christmas except these groups ' incessant fundraising . " <p> How the season of ho-ho-ho evolved into " Friend or Foe " shows how the nation 's culture wars have pushed into the season of giving . Each side wants its beliefs accurately represented around the nation 's winter hearth  --  its public schools and government spaces . <p> And if not , it will sue . <p> " It 's a sad day in America when you have to retain an attorney to say ' Merry Christmas , ' " said Mike Johnson , an Alliance Defense Fund attorney in Louisiana who will push the Christmas cause . <p> Organizers of the Christmas campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . They say teachers feel too intimidated to allow students to sing " Silent Night " in school , and they believe cities have every right to place a nativity scene in a public park . <p> Both activities are constitutionally protected , the Christian groups say , provided that the kids also sing secular songs and the cities put up nonreligious holiday displays as well . <p> Friends , according to " Friend or Foe " campaign sponsor Liberty Counsel , " do not discriminate against Christmas . " Foes are going to get a letter from one of the pro bono lawyers reminding them that " Christmas is constitutional , " not to mention a federal holiday . <p> " We 'll try to educate , " said Mat Staver , president of Liberty Counsel . " But if we ca n't , we 'll litigate . " <p> Or boycott . The American Family Association called Thursday for a Thanksgiving weekend shunning of Target stores , saying the chain was refusing to allow the phrase " Merry Christmas " on in-store promotions and advertising . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Target spokeswoman Carolyn Brookter replied . " We have no such policy on Christmas . You can see it in our stores . " <p> At one local Target , in Colma , most of the in-store advertising offers a generic " Gatherround . " One of the few advertising mentions of the C-word is above a Christmas card rack that says , " Celebrate Christmas . " <p> That 's not good enough for American Family Association President Tim Wildmon , who wants to see " Merry Christmas " signs displayed prominently " if they expect Christians to come in and buy products during this so-called season . " <p> And he is n't worried if they offend people who are n't Christian . <p> " They can walk right by the sign , " Wildmon said . " It 's a federal holiday . If someone is upset by that , well , they should know that they are living in a predominantly Christian nation . " <p> Where 's Wildmon shopping next weekend ? " Wal-Mart , " he said . <p> That chain was briefly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an employee described Christmas in an unflattering way in a company e-mail . The employee has since left and the boycott is off , though the Catholic Rights League still criticizes Wal-Mart for tellings its employees to say , " Happy holidays . " <p> Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Fogleman said the " Happy holidays " greeting is " more inclusive . With 130 million customers walking through the door and 1.3 million employees , it 's safe to say there are a lot of different faiths out there . " <p> The ACLU and its supporters believe they 're being drawn into a make-believe war . They say they 've fielded fewer holiday-season conflicts in recent years and that everybody seems to know the rules , except those trying to make a political point . <p> " People are free to worship in their homes and their houses of worship and if they rent out a hall , " said the ACLU 's Jeremy Gunn , national director of the group 's Freedom of Religion and Belief program . " You have to ask , why do they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing this in the name of religion is very , very sad , " Gunn said . " It would be one thing if they 're talking about consumerism of the season or something , but they 're not . " <p> Other groups are actively countering the Christmas campaigns . <p> The Anti-Defamation League said it would send letters to school administrators nationwide on how to negotiate the " December dilemma , " emphasizing that " schools must be careful not to cross the line between teaching about religious holidays ( which is permitted ) and celebrating religious holidays ( which is not ) . " <p> The issue is a dilemma for the Anti-Defamation League , too . It commissioned a poll last month of 800 adults , 57 percent of whom said Christianity was under attack . Among evangelicals , the figure was 76 percent . <p> " There 's a lot of fear out there , " said Finn Laursen , a retired school administrator who is now executive director of the Christian Educators Association International . <p> Standing in the middle of the fray are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Ramon Valley Unified School District . <p> Kessler said it 's OK , for example , for a teacher to bring a menorah into class . " But what 's not OK is if a teacher would begin lighting candles and saying prayers , " he said . " Then it becomes a religious ceremony . But , honestly , we have n't seen many instances of this in the last few years . " <p> The war has even spread to Bob Norris , head of the Christmas Tree Farmers Association of New York . He lent his organization 's name to the Alliance Defense Fund 's campaign because , he said , " The people who are fighting to save this country are in favor of Christmas . " <p> Sam Minturn , who heads the California Christmas Tree Association , said his group had n't taken a position on the issue . In fact , he does n't mind the term " holiday tree "  --  a phrase that angers some " Friend or Foe " campaigners . <p> " I do n't care what people call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Minturn , who lives in Merced County . " Go ahead and call them a weed . " Target is the subject of a boycott next weekend for allegedly banning " Merry Christmas , " an accusation the chain denies . / Kurt Rogers / The Chronicle
