Mixing both types together produces a lovely medium-textured polenta . SOFT VS . FIRM In the basic recipe , a 3-to-1 ratio of water to polenta yields a mixture with good body that sets up fairly firm . If you 're serving polenta soft and hot , you may want to add extra water , by the tablespoon , during the last 5 to 8 minutes of cooking . DO N'T GET BURNED Never underestimate the burn potential of hot polenta . When it splatters , it tends to stick where it lands , and if that 's your arm , you 'll know it . Polenta is most splatter-prone in the early cooking stage . Wear an oven mitt or wrap a thin tea towel around your stirring hand . UTENSILS A nonstick saucepan is best for making polenta , It takes the pressure off the " continuous stirring " mandate ( but only up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute or two ) . A longhandled whisk or wooden spoon works great for mixing the polenta . The stirring is necessary to cook the polenta evenly . Adding some butter or oil while the polenta cooks usually keeps sticking to a minimum . ADDING BUTTER Some recipes incorporate up to a stick of butter into the finished polenta ; 3 or 4 tablespoons is n't unusual . Obviously , the flavor and texture are superior when made this way , but it is n't necessary . PREPARED POLENTA It 's convenient , the flavor is good , and the texture nice and firm , so you can saute it with excellent results . The main drawbacks are that the packaged round shape does n't work well with many recipes , and you ca n't reheat it to make the soft variety . Sidebar Food for Thought Bell Pepper Whether they 're the familiar green and red varieties or the more exotic orange and purple , all bell peppers have a couple of things in common , notably their sweet , mellow flavor and low fat and calorie counts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red-actually just a fully mature green pepper-is a particularly good source , with more than 150 percent of the RDA . Red peppers also provide more than 80 percent of the RDA for beta-carotene , which converts in the body to vitamin A. On top of that , these versatile vegetables are among the few foods ( ruby red grapefruit and tomatoes being the others ) that deliver lycopene , a potent carotenoid that protects against several types of cancers . - J.C .
