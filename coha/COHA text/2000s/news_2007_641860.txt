<p> As a young lawyer , Allison S. Davis was a City Hall outsider . <p> He criticized Mayor Richard J. Daley over the 1968 riots . He worked to integrate Chicago neighborhoods . And he fought to elect judges based on legal ability , not political connections . <p> Today , Davis is a consummate City Hall insider . <p> He 's a loyal ally of Mayor Richard M. Daley , who appointed Davis to Chicago 's prestigious Plan Commission . Davis has gotten deal after deal from the mayor , helping to make Davis one of the city 's top developers . And Davis has forged strong ties to the Daley family , doing deals with one of the mayor 's nephews and giving legal business to Daley &; George , mayoral brother Michael Daley 's law firm . <p> Now , Davis finds himself in the glare of an unwanted spotlight . <p> One of his business partners , William Moorehead , recently began serving a four-year prison sentence for stealing more than $600,000 from at least 13 federally funded housing projects he managed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period Moorehead has admitted he was stealing the money , the Chicago Sun-Times has learned , he lent Davis $100,000  --  a loan that has drawn scrutiny from federal investigators , though Davis has n't been accused of any wrongdoing . <p> Another of Davis ' business partners , former top political fund-raiser Tony Rezko , is set to stand trial in February on charges he demanded kickbacks from companies seeking state teacher pension business under Gov . Blagojevich , a friend of Rezko . <p> Davis serves on a separate state pension board  --  the Illinois State Board of Investment  --  that also has been under federal investigation . Davis was appointed by Blagojevich , on Rezko 's recommendation . <p> Davis , 68 , declined repeated interview requests for this story . His spokesman asked that questions be submitted in writing . Davis then submitted written responses to some of them . <p> Over the last decade , Davis and his partners got lots covering several city blocks from City Hall . They paid a total of more than $7 million for some of those lots . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make money ' <p> Davis and his partners  --  including his sons Jared and Cullen  --  have gotten more than $100 million in taxpayer subsidies to build and rehabilitate more than 1,500 apartments and homes , primarily for the poor . His deals include a massive redevelopment of the Chicago Housing Authority 's notorious Stateway Gardens , across the Dan Ryan Expy. from Sox Park . <p> It 's a lucrative business . Davis and his partners have made at least $4 million in development fees over the last decade . <p> Still in the works : With Daley nephew Robert Vanecko , Davis is redeveloping another CHA project , along Chicago 's south lakefront . Their fees have not been disclosed . <p> As Davis has become one of City Hall 's favored developers in the last 10 years , he also has become a major political player . He has donated more than $400,000 to dozens of political campaign funds . His top beneficiaries include Daley , Blagojevich and Sen. Barack Obama , who worked for several years as an attorney in Davis ' law firm . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might seem unusual , but not to old friends and associates . <p> " Does any of that surprise me ? No , " said Robert Bennett , former dean of the Northwestern University Law School , who has known Davis since high school . " He 's an ambitious guy . He likes to make money . " <p> Returns from Africa in ' 67 <p> Davis grew up in Hyde Park , home to the University of Chicago . His father , also named Allison Davis , was the university 's first African-American professor and was pictured in 1994 on a commemorative U.S. postage stamp . <p> Davis attended three high schools : Cushing Academy in Massachusetts , the University of Chicago Lab School and Hyde Park High School . <p> He has a bachelor 's degree from Grinnell College in Iowa and a law degree from Northwestern University . <p> After law school , Davis and his first wife moved to West Africa , where he worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development , coordinating smallpox-eradication efforts and vocational training in Mali . <p> The couple returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's civil rights struggles . Davis took a job as a lawyer for the Metropolitan Housing and Planning Council , a civic group often at odds with the late Mayor Daley over slums and integration . <p> By 1969 , Davis , then 29 and a lawyer at a small firm , co-authored a report , titled " Dissent In A Free Society , " that criticized City Hall 's refusal to issue parade permits to protesters who rioted during the 1968 Democratic National Convention . <p> " No one can accurately appraise the extent to which denial of peaceful expression resulted in violent confrontation , " said the report , written for the Chicago Citizens Commission to Study the Disorders of Convention Week . <p> Making connections <p> Around that time , Davis was among a group of young attorneys who founded the Chicago Council of Lawyers . Its chief aim : to elect judges based on legal skills rather than their ties to the Cook County Democratic Party . <p> " Allison was a reform-minded lawyer , like me and some other young lawyers , " said Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark Shakman decree outlawing most City Hall patronage . <p> " He 's obviously moved from one kind of career direction and orientation to another . " <p> Some of those attorneys joined Davis in 1971 in setting up a small law firm  --  Davis Miner Barnhill  --  that focused on civil rights litigation and helping community groups redevelop Chicago neighborhoods . One partner , Judson Miner , went on to become City Hall 's top lawyer , under Mayor Harold Washington . Another firm lawyer , Carol Moseley-Braun , would become a U.S. senator . <p> And the firm would later attract a young Harvard Law School graduate  --  the future Sen. Barack Obama . <p> Among Davis ' first clients were his friends , Leon D. Finney Jr. , head of The Woodlawn Organization , and Bishop Arthur Brazier , pastor of the Apostolic Church of God . Finney and Brazier developed Jackson Park Terrace , a 322-unit apartment building at 60th and Stony Island , built with government financing in 1971 . Davis lists the project as the first of many low-income housing deals he has worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Davis soon began getting a string of government appointments . In 1974 , Gov . Dan Walker put Davis on the Illinois Capital Development Board , which oversees state construction projects . He got other appointments from Gov . James R. Thompson and Mayor Washington , who named Davis to the Chicago Public Building Commission , a seat Davis held when Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in 1989 . <p> Two years later , Daley appointed Davis to the Chicago Plan Commission , a position Davis held until last January . His fellow commissioners included his high school classmate , Finney . <p> As he served on the Plan Commission , reviewing major developments , Davis stepped up his own development activities . He was hired by George E. Johnson , the Chicago entrepreneur who made a fortune making Afro-Sheen and other hair-care products and cosmetics for African Americans . In 1994 , Davis helped Johnson refinance Island Terrace , a 240-unit , low-income housing building at 6430 S. Stony Island . Johnson gave Davis a 10 percent stake and put him in charge of running the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing projects across Chicago . Moorehead was a client of Davis ' law firm , and Davis and Moorehead were also business partners in housing deals . <p> " I admired Allison a lot , " Johnson said . " He was very emotionally involved in the civil rights movement . " <p> Davis gave up his law practice in 1996 to be a full-time developer and turned to Johnson and his wife , Joan , for backing . They gave Davis $500,000 , becoming partners in several deals , but the relationship would sour within five years . <p> " We made an investment to get Allison started in the developing business , " Johnson said . <p> " We only had a few black developers at the time . Joan and I and Allison went to the mayor 's office . We wanted the mayor to know that we were interested in Allison being successful in this business , " he said . <p> Johnson marvels at Davis ' success : " I 'm amazed at how much he 's gotten out of City Hall . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department discovered that Moorehead had been stealing from various housing projects  --  including Johnson 's Island Terrace . <p> Johnson blamed Davis for hiring Moorehead . <p> Moorehead pleaded guilty to fraud and other crimes last year , admitting he stole more than $600,000 from Island Terrace and other federally subsidized housing projects between 1994 and 2002 and used the money for personal expenses , covering up the thefts by improperly transferring money from one project to another . <p> Moorehead had gotten a letter in 2000 from Davis , who said the sale and refinancing of their Evergreen Sedgwick housing project had been delayed for months . " I need to borrow $100,000 from the Island Terrace resources , " Davis wrote in the letter , dated June 15 , 2000 . <p> Asked now about that letter , Davis said in a written response : " Mr. Moorehead made me a personal loan . I paid him back with interest six years ago . " <p> ' Not the good guy ' <p> Moorehead , who is cooperating in an ongoing federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not discuss the loan , on the advice of his lawyer . <p> After the thefts were discovered , Davis dumped Moorehead 's company and hired another firm to run Island Terrace  --  Urban Property Advisors , which is run by Davis ' son Cullen , who manages many of his father 's developments . <p> Johnson sued Davis in 2003 , charging that Davis mismanaged Island Terrace , letting the property fall into disrepair and failing to supervise Moorehead . <p> The case went to arbitration and was settled last year . In the end , Davis had to give up his share of Island Terrace , but Johnson lost his stake in Davis ' companies . <p> " He 's not the good guy I thought he was , " Johnson said . <p> A second problem partner <p> Rezko  --  Davis ' other problem partner  --  was involved in two major Chicago developments that Davis supported as a member of the city Plan Commission , even as the two men were business partners . <p> The first , which came before the Plan Commission in March 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahru went on to build along the Chicago River at Irving Park Road . Davis cast his vote for the project just a month after Rezko had helped Davis win an appointment from Blagojevich to the Illinois State Board of Investment , which oversees pension funds for state employees , judges and legislators . <p> A year later , in March 2004 , the Plan Commission approved Rezko 's proposal for the South Loop 's largest vacant property , 62 acres at Roosevelt and Clark . <p> Rezko wanted to build stores and hundreds of homes on the riverfront property , with $140 million in city subsidies . The deal ultimately collapsed shortly before Rezko was indicted on unrelated charges . <p> Before Davis voted to support Rezko 's deals , he said he checked with the city 's Law Department about whether his relationship with Rezko posed a problem . <p> " I raised that issue with the corporation counsel at the time , " Davis said , " and was advised that it is not a conflict and I do not need to abstain from voting . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men had a deal with the city to build three homes on formerly city-owned land , or face the prospect of having to give back the land . <p> They only built two homes , but the city has n't moved to retake the land .
