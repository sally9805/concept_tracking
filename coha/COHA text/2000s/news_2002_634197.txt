<p> The Bush administration 's welfare reform proposal represents the type of doublespeak that might be good for politics but is bad for people in poverty . <p> The Bush plan , recently released in Washington , ignores all lessons we 've learned that say a flexible and mixed-service approach works best . <p> President Bush speaks repeatedly and publicly about the importance of education and training . But look beyond the spin and you find that his plan is wrong on welfare and work . Here are three reasons : <p> *The plan micromanages welfare . It requires welfare clients to spend 24 hours in paid employment and a maximum of 16 hours in education , skills training or counseling . Any experienced training provider will tell you this 16-hour weekly allowance is not enough time for the chronically unemployed to learn marketable skills while struggling in low-wage , low-skilled jobs . <p> *The plan imperils Illinois ' flexibility to create policies that meet its own work force needs . Illinois has adopted policies allowing low-income residents  --  including the nation 's fifth-largest concentration of immigrants  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomas , vocational skills training and post-secondary education . The Bush plan would severely restrict progressive policies like these . <p> *The plan hands Illinois an unfunded mandate . The plan freezes the amount of federal welfare funding for Illinois and other states while governors are losing tax revenues and cutting budgets . Forget about using other federal dollars : The Bush 2003 budget calls for deep cuts in federally funded job training programs for low-income adults , dislocated workers and youth . <p> We are concerned that welfare clients who want to work will get one-size-fits-all service that will not help them gain the skills they need to compete in today 's labor market . The Chicago Jobs Council has worked with its members  --  about 100 community groups that have helped disadvantaged job-seekers find work  --  to develop a blueprint for reshaping Temporary Assistance for Needy Families into a policy that moves welfare recipients into work and out of poverty . <p> We suggest that the Bush administration listen to our experts on what it will take to make welfare really work . Otherwise , his promise to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them the education and training they need to succeed " is nothing but a lot of talk . <p> Robert E. Wordlaw , <p> executive director , <p> Chicago Jobs Council <p> President Bush 's one-vote victory in the House on March 12 , which means another amnesty for several hundred thousand illegal aliens , carries a poignant message : The American people are growing increasingly worried about an immigration policy that attaches more importance to " racial politics " than it does to national security . <p> The " mini-amnesty " Bush will take as a " gift " on his March 21 trip to Mexico is Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act , which permits illegal aliens to remain in this country without the stringent background checks that are given to legal immigrants prior to their arrival here . A $1,000 fine and " sponsorship " by a legal U.S. resident allows illegals to stay here while awaiting their green cards  --  a process that virtually takes years to complete . <p> Why spend billions on " homeland security " when , in efforts to appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loopholes in a dysfunctional immigration policy at the same time Congress is trying to close them ? <p> Meanwhile , the bodies of our citizens remain buried beneath the rubble of the World Trade Center , and the American president publicly " mourns " the deaths of Americans in Afghanistan . <p> David A. Gorak , <p> executive director , <p> Midwest Coalition <p> to Reduce Immigration <p> Felicia Middlebrooks ' $350,000 pay is obscenely excessive Rob Feder column , March 6 . All agree : $100,000 per year ( plus medical insurance ) is a generous salary for any person who reads ( reports ) the news , and/or edits the news off the wires . Even college students can do this well . <p> Of 13 WBBM home and morning-drive listeners that I talked with recently  --  seven male and six female  --  only two recognized the name Felicia Middlebrooks . <p> When we listen to the news on WBBM , we do not care whether the person who reports the news is male or female , young or old , white , black or green . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $350,000 salary , two Viacom shareholders were outraged at the waste of stockholders ' money . They feel that a downward restructuring of salaries is necessary . <p> T. Shelly Ashbell , M.D. , <p> Near North Side <p> As a Northwestern journalism grad , it was incredibly disheartening to learn that a respected , seasoned journalist  --  Felicia Middlebrooks of WBBM Newsradio  --  was being undervalued by corporate management . <p> I 've listened to Felicia for years and value her knowledge , integrity and professionalism . Now that WBBM is No. 1 , I find it disconcerting that management is not sharing the financial rewards with its journalists . <p> As a woman , I 'm also offended that Felicia 's male competitors in the morning ( WGN 's Spike O'Dell , WTMX 's Eric Ferguson and WLS ' Don Wade ) make twice the money that Felicia does while earning far lower ratings . Where is the fairness in that ? <p> Dawn McCormick , Oak Brook <p> An edifying March 8 article reported that a Chicago police officer rescued a bewildered rooster from a perilous traffic ordeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have saved dogs , cats , rabbits , ducks and virtually any animal that is traumatized in a life-or-death situation . The Chicago police treat their canines and horses as virtual family members . Conversely , some members of the criminal sector , who wrongly claim that all police are bad , are the same people who stage illicit cockfighting , dogfights and other types of brutal animal abuse . <p> Hopefully , the general public will continue to support the police . Their longstanding record of going beyond the call of duty to rescue stray animals is a testament to the compassion that many of them exhibit when they serve and protect . <p> Brien Comerford , Glenview <p> Interesting times we live in . As the GOP standard-bearer , George W. Bush said to the American public during his campaign : " Let the free market and open competition determine prices , get big government out of the economy and off the backs of the people , and let the fittest competitor survive . " Pretty formulaic Republican philosophy , right ? <p> Fast-forward to President Bush last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , that part about free markets and government non-intervention ? I 'm going to make an exception when those big business owners are friends and major contributors to my election campaign . Then I 'll be all for protectionism , tariffs , restraint of free trade  --  you know , all those things that we Republicans typically blame Democrats for . <p> " It does n't matter that those businesses are inefficient and ca n't compete in world markets . I 'll artificially prop them up , which will give them no incentive to improve their methods , and the American people will suffer for their ineptness by having to pay higher prices . " <p> I guess this is a Bush reincarnation of his father 's " Read my lips . " <p> Rob Neufeld , Northfield <p> Now that we are so close to election day three things bother me . One is that I have never taken the news media endorsements into consideration when I make my choice for whom I will vote . I like to be able to make my own choice based on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bothers me is that in a primary election you must vote for a Democrat or Republican . You can not cross over and pick whomever you might feel is best qualified . <p> A lot of people complain constantly about the ways things are run but then they do not vote . Senior citizens always make a real effort to get their vote counted . They know what their vote can mean . The past presidential election may have been different if more of the no-voters had come out to vote . <p> The bottom line here is to make up your mind and get out on March 19 and vote for who you feel is the best candidate . <p> Bob O'Halloran , Albany Park <p> As a member of the boards of Personal PAC and Planned Parenthood , I took great offense at a mailing I received Tuesday from Rod Blagojevich . It implies that Paul Vallas is not pro-choice , and uses the Planned Parenthood and Personal PAC logos to do so . Vallas is solidly pro-choice . He was endorsed by both Planned Parenthood and Personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to lie about other candidates ' records , he should not drag reputable organizations through the mud with him . <p> Kathy Tisdahl , Evanston <p> Following in the spirit and direction of Mary Laney 's column March 12 , I 'd wish everyone to open their eyes , too , but not necessarily just for reporting friends and neighbors to the police , the FBI and the CIA . Rather , to open their eyes to critically see  --  and read . Laney 's columns , for instance . And see that there 's much to be aware of and much , much more to beware of . <p> Beware of alarmists , Peeping Tom spies , specters and worm tongues . Beware of those among us who will turn us against ourselves for their selfish political motives . Beware of self-styled super-patriots destroying the very freedom of expression they claim to defend . Beware of those who incite first and blame others later . Beware of those who spread fear as caution , ignorance as justice and hate as understanding . And beware of writers who spread shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful in these terrifying times , yes , but we must watch how we are watching . <p> Robert D. Dominiec , <p> Lake View
