<p> The pictures would horrify anyone : hooded US soldiers raping and torturing naked Iraqi women at gunpoint . But for Farah al-Azzawi , these blurry photos burn with agony and shame . <p> Ms. Azzawi is part of a secret sisterhood : her mother is one of three women inside Abu Ghraib , the notorious prison where US soldiers took smiling snapshots of themselves sadistically humiliating Iraqis . <p> That 's why some anonymous ill-wisher slipped a newspaper with the rape photos on the front page under her front door . <p> The pictures in the paper are fakes , bad copies lifted from a porn website and now ricocheting around the Internet . But in Iraq , where the photos circulate on floppy discs and CDs and splash across newspapers and TV screens , most people believe them . <p> " I know they 're not real , but people wo n't believe it , " says Azzawi , a pretty 20-year-old , holding up the paper with a shaking hand . " Who 's going to marry their daughters after they see a thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes Azzawi 's hands shake with rage . What makes the counterfeit photos so searing , for her , is the fear that they might hold some truth . Among the 1,800 or so pictures taken by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib , there are others , viewed by Congress but not released to the public , of at least one Iraqi woman forced to bare her breasts . And a US military investigator , Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba , cited at least one case of a military police guard " having sex with " a female prisoner . <p> A spokesman denies that any of the five women now in coalition custody - three at Abu Ghraib , two more at other locations - have been abused . " All of these women being detained have been treated humanely , " says Lt. Col. Barry Johnson , a spokesman for the general in charge of detention operations . " None of their families need to be concerned that their dignity has been tarnished during their detention . " <p> But in Iraq , where rumors alone can destroy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more severe for women than for men . In a way , it scarcely matters if Azzawi 's mother was raped or not : If she denies being raped , nobody will believe her , because Iraqi women rarely admit to being raped , a charge that can ruin a woman 's life . <p> Now that there are real pictures of US troops sexually humiliating Iraqi women , reality and rumors have tangled inseparably . " With the pictures and the CDs , it becomes almost irrelevant if they 're raped or not , " says Manal Omar , the Iraq coordinator of Women for Women , which helps women in former war zones . " Even before the torture , the rumor was out that they were raping women in the prison . With or without the pictures from the porn site , the real pictures made people believe that . It made that rumor fact . " <p> Rumors of prison rape have been eddying for months . They started with a letter , allegedly smuggled out of Abu Ghraib by a female prisoner . Passed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being used by anti-US clerics and militants to stir up outrage against the occupation . <p> " Please , bomb us with bombs , and even with nuclear weapons , because we are all pregnant by American soldiers , " reads one version of the letter . " Every day they walk us naked in front of soldiers and other prisoners . We want you to know that if you have a daughter in here , or a mother , or a sister , that she has been raped and is pregnant by these American soldiers . " <p> The letter might be fabricated - different versions of it crop up , and no one has been able to find the girl who wrote it . But to most Iraqis , it does n't really matter : the real photos of abuse at Abu Ghraib gave all rumors , both true and false , instant credibility . <p> Even before the scandal at Abu Ghraib , many Iraqis viewed imprisonment of women as tantamount to rape . " In our culture , if a woman has been to prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Yanar Mohammed , a woman 's rights activist and editor of the newspaper Equality . " It is assumed that men have put their hands on her , that she has been touched in improper ways . " <p> In Iraq , even a whisper of rape is enough to dishonor a woman - and her family . Sometimes families will even kill women who have been raped to " wash " the stain from the family name . <p> That may be what happened to one girl , rumored to have been pregnant when she was released . " Her father and brother wanted to kill her , " says Huda al-Nuaimi , a professor at Baghdad University who is interviewing female prisoners as a volunteer for Amnesty International . " The sheikh of the mosque and the neighbors stopped them , because she was raped , and it was n't her fault . " <p> But when Dr. Nuaimi went to visit the girl , her family had moved away . The neighbors told her they did n't know where they went - unusual in Aadhimiyah , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this girl is still alive , " says Ms. Nuaimi , a professor who wears a tiny silver outline of Iraq around her neck . " I think , given this local custom , it would be very difficult for her to stay alive . " <p> Azzawi has n't seen her mother since Dec. 24th , the day she was arrested with her sister , Azzawi 's aunt . She goes to Abu Ghraib and spends hours standing in the dusty parking lot , hoping to be allowed to see her mother . But the guards on duty , she says , tell her , " there are no women here . " <p> In fact , there are three women at Abu Ghraib . Kept separately from the men , with female guards , the women are inside cellblock 1A , the infamous ward where most of the military pictures were taken . " They are living together , " says Colonel Johnson , " separated from the male detainees , for their own well being and to ensure their privacy is fully respected . " <p> Declining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother and aunt were among those three women . But Azzawi got a letter two months ago from the International Committee of the Red Cross , which monitors prison conditions , telling her that her mother was being held at Abu Ghraib . Like most families of detainees , she still does n't know whether her mother has been charged with any crime . <p> On May 14 , Azzawi was allowed to visit her uncle , also being held at Abu Ghraib . She took her cousin Raghada Qusay , a 14-year-old with large , sad eyes . Raghada 's mother - sister of Azzawi 's mother - is in Abu Ghraib , too . <p> The girls were horrified to see that their uncle 's nose had been broken . He told them it did n't matter . " What 's important are my sisters , " he told them tearfully through a glass window . " They were humiliated . I 'm desperate . " <p> They listened in horror as he told them what he said he 'd seen : Raghada 's mother forced to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijab , and my uncle told us they were dragging her by her hair , " says Raghada , her eyes red from crying . <p> In a torrent of words , she speaks of other tortures : her mother forced to eat from a dirty toilet . Urinated on . As the stories rush out , it 's hard to tell what she heard from her uncle and what is prison scuttlebutt . <p> As Raghada speaks , her 21-year-old sister Hiba breaks in and demands that she stop . Bursting into tears , Hiba runs from the room . " I 'm not afraid any more , " says Azzawi , angrily . " I 'll keep talking , even if they take me ! " <p> These days , the girls spend their time taking care of Raghada 's 3-year-old sister , and crying over the phone with other girls whose mothers are in jail . They visited another girl they knew , who had just been released from prison . She could n't speak ; they are sure she was raped . <p> " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have n't seen our mothers for five months . Azzawi is sure they are being tortured . " One day , they 'll be released , " she says grimly , " and they 'll tell everything .
