I 'm a bit of a control freak about my music collection , and staying on top of it is getting harder and harder . It was bad enough , a couple of years ago , trying to alphabetize a couple of hundred CDs . But then , like a lot of kids my age , I started doing Napster . Seven hundred downloads later , my collection is hopelessly Balkanized . To listen to a Moby track , I can stick a CD on the stereo . But to hear the remix , I have to run downstairs , fire up the PC and select the right M . I tried ripping all my CDs onto my computer , but its 2-GB hard drive gave out before I got to the Cs . <P> Solution ? Buy an M jukebox . Not those little M players that store maybe 10 songs at a time , but the new sandwich-size devices that have enough hard-disk storage for 120 hours of music and are flexible enough to plug into your home stereo , car stereo or PC . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 80s and ' 90s ? Imagine walking the streets with every tune you own ( and quite a few you borrowed ) in your pocket , one button push away from total aural bliss ! <P> That 's the theory , anyway . In practice , it 's not quite so easy . There are now three M jukeboxes on the market . Each has a hefty price tag ( between $400 and $600 ) and lousy battery life ( about four hours ) , and each is a first-generation device  --  which means imperfections are rife . The 6-GB Nomad Jukebox from Creative Labs takes ages to boot up . The 6-GB Personal Jukebox 100 from Remote Solutions only takes CD rips ( which means you ca n't transfer any Napster files you might have stored on your PC ) . And the 9-GB Neo 25 from SSI is a pain to navigate , forcing you to scroll through every track on a tiny LCD screen . <P> If you ca n't wait a year or so for second-generation devices  --  and why should you ?  --  I recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgradeable  --  meaning when the wrinkles are ironed out of its operating system ( which in its current version forgets those songs you 've lined up the instant it powers down ) , you 'll be able to download the improved version for free . <P> The Nomad is also the only one of the three jukeboxes that functions like , well , a jukebox  --  only without the quarters . You can select your songs in a flash ( they start playing instantly ) and queue up new tunes even as the old ones are playing . The Nomad would be perfect for a long road trip with your co-pilot playing deejay  --  except , of course , for that pesky four-hour battery life . ( Remote Solutions solves that problem by shipping its jukebox with a car-outlet adapter . ) <P> Still , the Nomad was good enough to get me started . Its hard disk , unfortunately , was not sufficiently spacious to store my entire collection . Creative Labs claims the average CD collection is much smaller than mine , between 80 and 120 CDs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my bulky medley is now squatting happily on my computer 's hard drive ; I just swap tracks as necessary . <P> Meanwhile , I 'm happy to report that the Nomad can not only alphabetize tracks but cross-index by album , artist and genre . That 's going to keep me occupied for some months to come . <P> For more information about the Nomad Jukebox , visit
