Anyone who sentimentalizes childhood is , of course , an idiot . Childhood is an ordeal and a journey  --  dangerous , magical , sometimes humiliating and , since you are at the mercy of adults , fairly weird . Little Andris Grof 's childhood was somewhat more so . <P> In wartime Hungary , Andris  --  age eight and passing as a gentile under the Slavic name Andris Malesevics  --  learned never to urinate in front of other children , lest his circumcised penis give him away . Sensible policy . In Budapest 's City Park one day in 1943 , a little girl turned to him and said , " Jesus Christ was killed by the Jews , and because of that , all the Jews will be thrown into the Danube . " The child adumbrated Adolf Eichmann , the Nazi bureaucrat who months later took charge of the deportation and extermination of Hungarian Jews . <P> Andris Grof survived Eichmann and more  --  including the Soviet occupation of Hungary ( out of the Nazi frying pan , into the communist fire ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 , with thousands of his compatriots , Grof sneaked across the Austrian border in the middle of the night and then sailed to America . In New York City , he Americanized his name to Andrew S. Grove  --  Andy Grove . This immigrant 's story has a gaudily triumphant sequel . In the fullness of the American dream , Grove became one of the founders of Intel ( he 's now chairman of the company , the world 's largest maker of semiconductors ) , a pioneer of the information revolution and in 1997 TIME 's Man of the Year . <P> Grove tells the story of his first 20 years in Swimming Across ( Warner Books ; 290 pages ; $26.95 ) , an astringently unsentimental memoir that may find its place on a shelf with such works as Angela 's Ashes , George Orwell 's autobiographical essay " Such , Such Were the Joys " and Tobias Wolff 's This Boy 's Life .

The son of nonreligious Jews , Andris , whose father was a partner in a dairy business , first shows himself to the reader on his third birthday , Sept. 2 , 1939 , scooting in a new toy car along the promenade on the banks of the Danube . Grove does not mention that one day earlier , Hitler had invaded Poland . <P> The air raids in Budapest started in 1943 . The family was dozing in an air-raid shelter in the middle of the night when a nearby apartment house was hit : " It looked like a big knife had sliced off the front half of every floor . You could see into the apartments on all four stories , like a doll 's house .

They arrested the building superintendent 's wife for bringing chicken soup and mashed potatoes to Andris when he was sick : against the law to feed Jews . One day Andris looked outside his window and saw German soldiers loading the occupants of a Jewish apartment building into trucks : " The people filing out ... all had their hands in the air , even the little kids , who were being carried by their parents .
