Better known as Miss Manners , Martin has helped transform etiquette from the realm of society matrons to a tool for everyday life . In her new book , Star-Spangled Manners , she argues that American manners are an engine of equality . She talked to TIME 's Richard Stengel , whom she hardly corrected at all . <P> SO DO PEOPLE GET NERVOUS AROUND YOU AND START MINDING THEIR P 'S AND Q 'S ? I certainly hope so ! Laughs . But , no , I do n't go around in my Miss Manners capacity where I would scare people to death . <P> WHAT 'S CHARACTERISTIC OF AMERICAN MANNERS  --  AND , BY THE WAY , ARE THEY GETTING ANY BETTER ? A lack of obsequiousness . A **27;15848;TOOLONG quality . That 's the basic idea . I 've been attacking American manners for 25 years , and I succeeded too well . Americans concluded that we 're naturally crude . The truth is that America invented the idea of etiquette as equality . That principle has been a major influence in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW AMERICAN MANNERS HAVE AFFECTED ATTITUDES AROUND THE WORLD . The dignity of labor . Even if someone has all the money in the world and just spends it , we look down on him or her . This has spread everywhere . Now every aristocratic twig has to have a shop or a career . <P> WERE THE FOUNDING FATHERS CONCERNED WITH ETIQUETTE ? George Washington felt that every inch of his person was setting a pattern . So did Jefferson , but in the opposite direction . He rejected all hierarchy . His guests complained that he entertained in slippers . But they were both convinced that European etiquette was outmoded . The question was , How do you treat people as equals and still have respect , and still have a government ? <P> DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL HAVE A ROLE  --  AND HOW 'S GEORGE BUSH DOING ? Every President is trying to strike a balance between being too full of himself and too chummy . Being a polite person , I do n't go around criticizing individuals who are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETIQUETTE THAT YOU SEE ? Yes , cyberspace is a new form of community . Remember its motto  --  No Rules ? But soon there were etiquette rules called Netiquette posted in every chat room . You ca n't have a sense of community without rules . <P> HAVE MANNERS IN THE BUSINESS WORLD CHANGED ? There is a pseudosocial aura of equality in business now where everyone goes by his or her first name . This is faux equality . If everyone were really equal , no one would get fired . <P> YOU SUGGEST PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE OF BAD MANNERS THESE DAYS . ANY EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE GOING TOO FAR TO MODIFY RUDE BEHAVIOR ? People are more and more using the law to outlaw behavior that is merely annoying or disgusting . Cities are legislating against cell phones and smoking . To use the law to control that kind of behavior gives us a lot less freedom . Etiquette is voluntary . Its enforcement arm is disapproval . <P> WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE GOING OVERBOARD IN BEING TOO FORMAL ? American life has been so relentlessly informal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school proms and weddings , they go out of their minds .
