One They called her the Queen of the Dead . Though no one ever said it to her face , Dr. Maura Isles sometimes heard the nickname murmured in her wake as she traveled the grim triangle of her job between courtroom and death scene and morgue . Sometimes she would detect a note of dark sarcasm : Ha ha , there she goes , our Goth goddess , out to collect fresh subjects . Sometimes the whispers held a tremolo of disquiet , like the murmurs of the pious as an unholy stranger passes among them . It was the disquiet of those who could not understand why she chose to walk in Death 's footsteps . Does she enjoy it , they wonder ? Does the touch of cold flesh , the stench of decay , hold such allure for her that she has turned her back on the living ? They think this can not be normal , and they cast uneasy glances her way , noting details that only reinforce their beliefs that she is an odd duck . The ivory skin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slash of lipstick . Who else wears lipstick to a death scene ? Most of all , it 's her calmness that disturbs them , her coolly regal gaze as she surveys the horrors that they themselves can barely stomach . Unlike them , she does not avert her gaze . Instead she bends close and stares , touches . She sniffs . And later , under bright lights in her autopsy lab , she cuts . She was cutting now , her scalpel slicing through chilled skin , through subcutaneous fat that gleamed a greasy yellow . A man who liked his hamburgers and fries , she thought as she used pruning shears to cut through the ribs and lifted the triangular shield of breastbone the way one opens a cupboard door , to reveal its treasured contents . The heart laycradled in its spongey bed of lungs . For fifty-nine years , it had pumped blood through the body of Mr. Samuel Knight . It had grown with him , aged with him , transforming , as he had , from the lean muscle of youth to this well-larded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Knight 's as he 'd sat in his Boston hotel room with the TV turned on and a glass of whiskey from the minibar sitting beside him on the nightstand . She did not pause to wonder what his final thoughts might have been , or whether he had felt pain or fear . Though she explored his most intimate recesses , though she flayed open his skin and held his heart in her hands , Mr. Samuel Knight remained a stranger to her , a silent and undemanding one , willingly offering up his secrets . The dead are patient . They do not complain , nor threaten , nor cajole . The dead do not hurt you ; only the living do . She worked with serene efficiency , resecting the thoracic viscera , laying the freed heart on the cutting board . Outside , the first snow of December swirled , white flakes whispering against windows and slithering down alleys . But here in the lab , the only sounds were of running water and the hiss of the ventilator fan . Her assistant Yoshima moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed him . They had worked together only a year and a half , yet already they functioned like a single organism , linked by the telepathy of two logical minds . She did not need to ask him to redirect the lamp ; it was already done , the light shining down on the dripping heart , a pair of scissors held out and waiting for her to take them . The darkly mottled wall of the right ventricle , and the white apical scar , told her this heart 's sad story . An old myocardial infarction , months or even years old , had already destroyed part of the left ventricular wall . Then , sometime in the last twenty-four hours , a fresh infarction had occurred . A thrombus had blocked off the right coronary artery , strangling the flow of blood to the muscle of the right ventricle . She resected tissue for histology , already knowing what she would see under the microscope . Coagulation and necrosis . The invasion of white cells , moving in like a defending army . Perhaps Mr. Samuel Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indigestion . Too much lunch , should n't have eaten all those onions . Maybe Pepto-Bismol would do the trick . Or perhaps there 'd been more ominous signs which he chose to ignore : the weight on his chest , the shortness of breath . Surely it did not occur to him that he was having a heart attack . That , a day later , he would be dead of an arrhythmia . The heart now lay open and sectioned on the board . She looked at the torso , missing all its organs . So ends your business trip to Boston , she thought . No surprises here . No foul play , except for the abuse you heaped on your own body , Mr. Knight . The intercom buzzed . " Dr. Isles ? " It was Louise , her secretary . " Yes ? " " Detective Rizzoli 's on line two for you . Can you take the call ? " " I 'll pick up . " Maura peeled off her gloves and crossed to the wall phone . Yoshima , who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faucet . He turned to watch her with his silent tiger eyes , already knowing what a call from Rizzoli signified . When at last Maura hung up , she saw the question in his gaze . " It 's starting early today , " she said . Then she stripped off her gown and left the morgue , to usher another subject into her realm . The morning 's snowfall had turned into a treacherous mix of both snow and sleet , and the city plows were nowhere in sight . She drove cautiously along Jamaica Riverway , tires swishing through deep slush , windshield wipers scraping at hoar-frosted glass . This was the first winter storm of the season , and drivers had yet to adjust to the conditions . Already , several casualties had slid off the road , and she passed a parked police cruiser , its lights flashing , the patrolman standing beside a tow truck driver as they both gazed at a car that had tipped into a ditch . The tires of her Lexus began to slide sideways , the front bumper veering toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the vehicle 's automatic skid control kick into action . She pulled the car back into her lane . Screw this , she thought , her heart thudding . I 'm moving back to California . She slowed to a timid crawl , not caring who honked at her or how much traffic she held up . Go ahead and pass me , idiots . I 've met too many drivers like you on my slab . The road took her into Jamaica Plain , a west Boston neighborhood of stately old mansions and broad lawns , of serene parks and river walks . In the summertime , this would be a leafy retreat from the noise and heat of urban Boston , but today , under bleak skies , with winds sweeping across barren lawns , it was a desolate neighborhood . The address she sought seemed the most forbidding of all , the building set back behind a high stone wall over which a smothering tangle of ivy had scrambled . A barricade to keep out the world , she thought . From the street , all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one towering gable window which peered back at her like a dark eye . A patrol car parked near the front gate confirmed that she had found the correct address . Only a few other vehicles had arrived so farthe shock troops before the larger army of crime-scene techs arrived . She parked across the street and braced herself against the first blast of wind . When she stepped out of the car , her shoe skidded right out from under her , and she barely caught herself , hanging onto the vehicle door . Dragging herself back to her feet , she felt icy water trickle down her calves from the soaked hem of her coat , which had fallen into the slush . For a few seconds she just stood there , sleet stinging her face , shocked by how quickly it had all happened . She glanced across the street at the patrolman sitting in his cruiser , and saw that he was watching her , and had surely seen her slip . Her pride stung , she grabbed her kit from the front seat , swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much dignity as she could muster , across the rime-slicked road . " You okay , Doc ? " the patrolman called out through his car window , a concerned inquiry she really did not welcome . " I 'm fine . " " Watch yourself in those shoes . It 's even more slippery in the courtyard . " " Where 's Detective Rizzoli ? " " They 're in the chapel . " " And where 's that ? " " Ca n't miss it . It 's the door with the big cross on it . " She continued to the front gate , but found it locked . An iron bell hung on the wall ; she tugged on the pull rope , and the medieval clang slowly faded into the softer tick , tick of falling sleet . Just beneath the bell was a bronze plaque , its inscription partially obscured by a strand of brown ivy . Graystones Abbey The Sisters of Our Lady of Divine Light " The harvest is indeed great , but the laborers are few . Pray , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the gate , a woman swathed in black suddenly appeared , her approach so silent that Maura gave a start when she saw the face staring at her through the bars . It was an ancient face , so deeply lined it seemed to be collapsing in on itself , but the eyes were bright and sharp as a bird 's . The nun did not speak , posing her question with only her gaze . " I 'm Dr. Isles from the Medical Examiner 's office , " said Maura . " The police called me here . " The gate squealed open . Maura stepped into the courtyard . " I 'm looking for Detective Rizzoli . I believe she 's in the chapel . " The nun pointed directly across the courtyard . Then she turned and shuffled slowly into the nearest doorway , abandoning Maura to make her own way to the chapel . Snowflakes whirled and danced amid needles of sleet , like white butterflies circling their lead-footed cousins . The most direct route was to cross the courtyard , but the stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their gripless soles , had already proven no match for such a surface . She ducked instead beneath the narrow covered walkway that ran along the courtyard 's perimeter . Though protected from the sleet , she found little shelter here from the wind , which sliced through her coat . She was shocked by the cold , reminded yet again of how cruel December in Boston could be . For most of her life , she had lived in San Francisco , where a glimpse of snowflakes was a rare delight , not a torment , like these stinging nettles that swirled under the overhang to nip her face . She veered closer to the building and hugged her coat tighter as she passed darkened windows . From beyond the gate came the faint swish of traffic on Jamaica Riverway . But here , within these walls , she heard only silence . Except for the elderly nun who had admitted her , the compound seemed abandoned . So it was a shock when she saw three faces staring at her from one of the windows . The nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , watching the intruder make her way deeper into their sanctuary . Their gazes swerved in unison , following her as she moved past . The entrance to the chapel was draped with a strand of yellow crime scene tape , which had sagged in the doorway and hung crusted with sleet . She lifted the tape to step beneath it and pushed open the door . A camera flash exploded in her eyes and she froze , the door slowly hissing shut behind her , blinking away the afterimage that had seared her retinas . As her vision cleared , she saw rows of wooden pews , whitewashed walls , and at the front of the chapel , an enormous crucifix hanging above the altar . It was a coldly austere room , its gloom deepened by the stained glass windows , which admitted only a murky smear of light . " Hold it right there . Be careful where you step , " said the photographer . Maura looked down at the stone floor and saw blood . And footprintsa confusing jumble of them , along with medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ambulance crew . But no body . Her gaze moved in a wider circle , taking in the piece of trampled white cloth lying in the aisle , the splashes of red on the pews . She could see her own breath in this frigid room , and the temperature seemed to drop even colder , her chill deepening as she read the bloodstains , saw the successive splashes moving up the rows of benches , and understood what had happened here . The photographer began to click off more shots , each one a visual assault on Maura 's eyes . " Hey Doc ? " At the front of the chapel , a mop of dark hair popped up as Detective Jane Rizzoli rose to her feet and waved . " The vic 's up here . " " What about this blood here , by the door ? " " That 's from the other victim , Sister Ursula . Med-Q boys took her to St. Francis . There 's more blood along that center aisle , and some footprints we 're trying to preserve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick close to the wall . " Maura paused to pull on paper shoe-covers , then edged along the perimeter of the room , hugging the wall . Only as she cleared the front row of pews did she see the nun 's body , lying faceup , the fabric of her habit a black pool blending into a larger lake of red . Both hands had already been bagged to preserve evidence . The victim 's youth took Maura by surprise . The nun who had let her in the gate , and those she had seen through the window , had all been elderly . This woman was far younger . It was an ethereal face , her pale blue eyes frozen in a look of eerie serenity . Her head was bare , the blond hair shorn to barely an inch long . Every terrible blow was recorded in the torn scalp , the misshapen crown . " Her name 's Camille Maginnes . Sister Camille . Hometown , Hyannisport , " said Rizzoli , sounding Dragnet-cool and businesslike . " She was the first novice they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final vows in May . " She paused , then added : " She was only twenty , " and her anger cracked through the facade . " She 's so young . " " Yeah . Looks like he beat the shit out of her . " Maura pulled on gloves and crouched down to study the destruction . The death instrument had left raggedly linear lacerations on the scalp . Fragments of bone protruded through torn skin , and a clump of gray matter had oozed out . Though the facial skin was largely intact , it was suffused a dark purple . " She died facedown . Who turned her onto her back ? " " The sisters who found her , " said Rizzoli . " They were looking for a pulse . " " What time were the victims discovered ? " " About eight this morning . " Rizzoli glanced at her watch . " Nearly two hours ago . " " Do you know what happened ? What did the sisters tell you ? " " It 's been hard getting anything useful out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they 're all in a state of shock . Here they think they 're safe . Protected by God . And then some lunatic breaks in . " " There are signs of forced entry ? " " No , but it would n't be all that hard to get into the compound . There 's ivy growing all over the wallsyou could hop right over without too much trouble . And there 's also a back gate , leading to a field , where they have their gardens . A perp could get in that way , too . " " Footprints ? " " A few in here . But outside , they 'd be pretty much buried under snow . " " So we do n't know that he actually broke in . He could have been admitted through that front gate . " " It 's a cloistered order , Doc . No one 's allowed inside the gates except for the parish priest , when he comes in to say Mass and hear confession . And there 's also a lady who works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she ca n't get child care . But that 's it . No one else comes in without the Abbess 's approval . And the sisters stay inside . They leave only for doctors ' appointments and family emergencies . " " Who have you spoken to so far ? " " The Abbess , Mother Mary Clement . And the two nuns who found the victims . " " What did they tell you ? " Rizzoli shook her head . " Saw nothing , heard nothing . I do n't think the others will be able to tell us much , either . " " Why not ? " " Have you seen how old they are ? " " It does n't mean they do n't have their wits about them . " " One of them 's gorked out by a stroke and two of them have Alzheimer 's . Most of them sleep in rooms facing away from the courtyard , so they would n't have seen a thing . " At first Maura simply crouched over Camille 's body , not touching it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hurt you now , she thought . She began to palpate the scalp , and felt the crunch of shifting bone fragments beneath the skin . " Multiple blows . All of them landed on the crown or the back of the skull . . . . " " And the facial bruising ? Is that just lividity ? " " Yes . And it 's fixed . " " So the blows came from behind . And above . " " The attacker was probably taller . " " Or she was down on her knees . And he was standing over her . " Maura paused , hands touching cool flesh , arrested by the heartbreaking image of this young nun , kneeling before her attacker , blows raining down on her bowed head . " What kind of bastard goes around beating up nuns ? " said Rizzoli . " What the fuck is wrong with this world ? " Maura winced at Rizzoli 's choice of words . Though she could n't remember the last time she 'd set foot in a church , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sanctified place disturbed her . Such was the power of childhood indoctrination . Even she , for whom saints and miracles were now merely fantasies , would never utter a curse in full view of the cross . But Rizzoli was too angry to care what words came tumbling out of her mouth , even in this sacred place . Her hair was more disheveled than usual , a wild , black mane glistening with melted sleet . The bones of her face jutted out in sharp angles beneath pale skin . In the gloom of the chapel , her eyes were bright coals , lit with rage . Righteous anger had always been Jane Rizzoli 's fuel , the essence of what drove her to hunt monsters . Today , though , she seemed feverish with it , and her face was thinner , as though the fire was now consuming her from within . Maura did not want to feed those flames . She kept her voice dispassionate , her questions businesslike . A scientist dealing in facts , not emotions . She reached for Sister Camille 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaccid . No rigor mortis . " " Less than five , six hours then ? " " It 's also cold in here . " Rizzoli gave a snort , exhaling a puff of vapor in the frigid air . " No kidding . " " Just above freezing , I 'd guess . Rigor mortis would be delayed . " " How long ? " " Almost indefinitely . " " What about her face ? The fixed bruising ? " " Livor mortis could have happened within half an hour . It does n't help us all that much with time of death . " Maura opened her kit and set out the chemical thermometer to measure ambient temperature . She eyed the victim 's many layers of clothing and decided not to take a rectal temperature until after the body had been transported to the morgue . The room was poorly litnot a place in which she could adequately rule out sexual assault prior to the insertion of the thermometer . Wrestling off clothes might also dislodge trace evidence . Instead she took out syringes to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her one estimate for time of death . " Tell me about the other victim , " Maura said as she pierced the left eye and slowly withdrew vitreous fluid into the syringe . Rizzoli gave a groan of disgust at the procedure and turned away . " The vic found by the door was Sister Ursula Rowland , sixty-eight years old . Must be a tough old bird . They said she was moving her arms when they loaded her into the ambulance . Frost and I got here just as they were driving away . " " How badly injured was she ? " " I did n't see her . Latest report we got from St. Francis Hospital is that she 's in surgery . Multiple skull fractures and bleeding into the brain . " " Like this victim . " " Yeah . Like Camille . " The anger was back in Rizzoli 's voice . Maura rose to her feet and stood shivering . Her trousers had wicked freezing water from the soaked hem of her coat , and her calves felt encased in ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene was indoors , so she had not brought her scarf or wool gloves from the car . This unheated room was scarcely warmer than the sleet-swept courtyard outside . She shoved her hands into her coat pockets , and wondered how Rizzoli , who was also without warm gloves and scarf , could linger so long in this frigid chapel . Rizzoli seemed to carry her own heat source within her , the fever of her outrage , and although her lips were turning blue , she did not seem in a hurry to seek a warmer room anytime soon . " Why is it so cold in here ? " asked Maura . " I ca n't imagine they 'd want to hold Mass in this room . " " They do n't . This part of the building 's never used in winterit 's too expensive to heat . There are so few of them still living here , anyway . For Mass , they use a small chapel off the rectory . " Maura thought of the three nuns she 'd seen through the window , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering out one by one . " If this chapel 's not used , " she said , " what were the victims doing in here ? " Rizzoli gave a sigh , exhaling a dragon 's breath of vapor . " No one knows . The Abbess says the last time she saw Ursula and Camille was at prayers last night , around nine . When they did n't appear at morning prayers , the sisters went looking for them . They never expected to find them in here . " " All these blows to the head . It looks like sheer rage . " " But look at her face , " said Rizzoli , pointing to Camille . " He did n't hit her face . He spared her face . That makes it seem a lot less personal . As if he 's not swinging at her specifically , but at what she is . What she stands for . " " Authority ? " said Maura . " Power ? " " Funny . I would have said something along the lines of faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a Catholic high school . " " You ? " Rizzoli gave a snort . " Never would 've guessed . " Maura took a deep breath of chilly air and looked up at the cross , remembering her years at Holy Innocents Academy . And the special torments meted out by Sister Magdalene , who had taught history . The torment had not been physical but emotional , dispensed by a woman who was quick to identify which girls had , in her opinion , an unseemly excess of confidence . At the age of fourteen , Maura 's best friends had not been people , but books . She 'd easily mastered all her classwork , and had been proud of it , too . That was what had brought Sister Magdalene 's wrath down upon her shoulders . For Maura 's own good , that unholy pride in her own intellect needed to be beaten into humility . Sister Magdalene went about the task with vicious gusto . She had held Maura up to ridicule in class , had written cutting comments in the margins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand to ask a question . In the end , Maura had been reduced to conquered silence . " They used to intimidate me , " said Maura . " The nuns . " " I did n't think anything scared you , Doc . " " Lots of things scare me . " Rizzoli laughed . " Just not dead bodies , huh ? " " There are far scarier things in this world than dead bodies . " They left the body of Camille lying on her bed of cold stone and moved back around the room 's perimeter , toward the bloodstained floor where Ursula had been found , still alive . The photographer had completed his work and departed ; only Maura and Rizzoli remained in the chapel , two lone women , their voices echoing off stark walls . Maura had always thought of chapels as universal sanctuaries , where even the spirit of the unbeliever might be comforted . But she found no comfort in this bleak place , where Death had walked , contemptuous of holy symbols . " They found Sister Ursula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying with her head pointed toward the altar , her feet toward the door . " As though prostrating herself before the crucifix . " This guy 's a fucking animal , " said Rizzoli , the angry words clipped off like shards of ice . " That 's what we 're dealing with . Out of his mind . Or some coked-up asshole looking for something to steal . " " We do n't know it 's a man . " Rizzoli waved toward the body of Sister Camille . " You think a woman did that ? " " A woman can swing a hammer . Crush a skull . " " We found a footprint . There , halfway up the aisle . Looked to me like a man 's size twelve . " " One of the ambulance crew ? " " No , you can see the Med-Q team 's footprints here , near the door . That one in the aisle 's different . That one 's his . " The wind blew , rattling the windows , and the door creaked as though invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rizzoli 's lips had chilled to blue , and her face had taken on a corpselike pallor , but she showed no intention of seeking a warmer room . That was Rizzoli , too stubborn to be the first to capitulate . To admit she had reached her limit . Maura looked down at the stone floor where Sister Ursula had been lying , and she could not disagree with Rizzoli 's instincts , that this attack was an act of insanity . This was madness she saw here , in these bloodstains . In the blows slammed into Sister Camille 's skull . Either madness , or evil . An icy draft seemed to blow straight up her spine . She straightened , shivering , and her gaze fixed on the crucifix . " I 'm freezing , " she said . " Can we get warm somewhere ? Get a cup of coffee ? " " Are you finished here ? " " I 've seen what I need to . The autopsy will tell us the rest . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
