Until a couple of weeks ago , figuring out who was to blame for the intelligence failures before Sept. 11 was n't on Tom Daschle 's must-do list . Since the beginning of the year , the majority leader had been busy corralling balky Democrats in the Senate on the down-home issues that would play best in the November elections : Social Security , health care , education , pension protection and the environment . But with evidence of FBI bungling impossible to ignore and reporters badgering him for a response , Daschle decided to go off message in a politically risky way . He announced on May 21 that he would introduce a bill as early as this week to form an independent commission to probe what went wrong . <P> President Bush was not happy . Senate minority leader Trent Lott went ballistic and said the Republicans would block the measure . FBI Director Robert Mueller 's mea culpa last week gave Daschle some needed cover for his proposal . But the danger for Daschle was closer to home : his action just might jeopardize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as majority leader . Polls show that while Republicans are vulnerable on domestic issues , Democrats are ill advised to go after Bush 's popular war on terrorism . And no one knows that better than Daschle 's rival Lott . " Our message is , Defense first , " Lott countered , accusing Daschle of trying to interrupt Bush 's war with a political inquisition . <P> This week marks the one-year anniversary of the Democrats ' taking over the Senate after Daschle enticed Vermont Senator James Jeffords to bolt from the Republican Party . For Daschle , the year has been an emotional roller coaster , with an anthrax-laced letter shutting down his Senate office for almost six months and conservative groups , egged on by Lott and the White House , blanketing his home state of South Dakota with TV and newspaper ads demonizing him for blocking Bush 's agenda . <P> The attacks have hardly dented Daschle 's popularity back home . In a state with only 530,000 voters , he 's used to cultivating his constituents virtually one by one . Last month he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduating class of 12 high school seniors in Hecla , S.D. , a tiny town near the North Dakota border  --  a shrewd political gesture that got him major newspaper play in the state . But Daschle , who has had a beefed-up security detail since Sept. 11 , is seething over being targeted by the G.O.P. , believing it 's partly responsible for threats he continues to receive . Newspaper ads have depicted him side by side with Iraq 's dictator . " When they compare me to Saddam Hussein , I do n't know how much more negative it can get , " he says . <P> Managing the Senate with a one-vote majority has n't been a picnic ; Daschle likens it to " loading frogs on a wheelbarrow . " Senate Democrats are a fractured  --  and fractious  --  bunch , including liberals itching to blast Bush , Southern " Dealocrats " who want to compromise with the White House , and presidential wannabes with their eyes on the 2004 prize . Daschle , who keeps an index card in his shirt pocket with favors that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their complaints . He has cultivated all of them , says majority whip Harry Reid , by " convincing each Senator that he or she is his favorite . "
