Large SUVs too thirsty ? minivans a little too boring ? three-row crossovers are the perfect blend of sport and utility . PHOTOGRAPHS BY NATHANIEL WELCH The template for the American family car is changing  --  again . Folks have grown weary of thirsty , stiff-riding trucks . And minivans , as functional as they may be , just are n't hip . But families need to haul the troops , and manufacturers still want to sell them cars . Hence , the crossover , a vehicle that tries to offer the best of three seemingly contradictory worlds : the attitude of an SUV , the practicality of a minivan and the sophistication of a sedan . Suddenly , crossovers  --  especially those with three rows of seating  --  have become one of the hottest segments of the market . Nearly a dozen new models will debut this year . But locating the crossover sweet spot is tricky . Some models favor storage capacity over style , while others sacrifice off-road ruggedness for sporty handling or a plush interior . Finding the perfect compromise is partly a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models , the main criterion was real-world practicality . We loaded coolers , beach chairs and baby seats and spent hours riding in third-row seats . We braved parking garages , mountain roads and urban jungles , all in addition to running our normal test regimen . The upshot ? Turns out practicality and fun are n't always mutually exclusive . Photograph : The above three finished at the top of our scorecard . We also tested the Toyota Highlander , Subaru Tribeca and the Honda Pilot ( right ) . SIXTH PLACE Honda Pilot EX The Pilot is both visually and dynamically the square peg of this test . It 's capable in a very traditional SUV-like sense without the modern feel and swoopy sheetmetal of many crossovers . The boxy body provides excellent visibility and an airiness to the cabin . Yet , third-row access and legroom are surprisingly compromised for such a large vehicle . The Pilot rode smoothly , and fearlessly tackled the deepest potholes . Hondas are usually track stars  --  but not this time . At the strip , the Pilot 's 244-hp 3.5-liter V6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot 's soft suspension and tall-profile , comfort-biased tires have very obvious limitations when speed and corners are combined . A twisty road driven hard is a tire-squealing , under-steering affair . Nothing unsafe , just not at all fun . However , if that road were a slick , muddy two-track , the Honda would be our first choice . It 's the only one here with a locking rear differential for low-speed four-wheeling . That makes it the most competent off-road vehicle of this group . The Pilot also ties the Saturn Outlook for highest towing capacity  --  4500 pounds . So , while it might lack the zip and polish of its competitors , the Pilot is a robust , roomy and capable crossover . FIFTH PLACE Subaru Tribeca Limited The sporty Subaru was one of the best-handling models in the test . Of course , given Subaru 's rally racing heritage , we expected some of that pedigree would rub off on this flagship vehicle . Next to the Mazda , the Subaru had the most talented footwork and posted high speeds in our handling tests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cones , and the most fun , too . On the street , all our testers were fans of the Subaru 's poise . However , the steering was particularly heavy at lower speeds . We wonder if smaller drivers would tolerate that extra steering heft every day . A mild freshening this year has brought new sheetmetal and a larger 256-hp 3.6-liter flat Six . Yep , it 's a flat Six  --  just like a Porsche . Do n't expect the growl of a fine-tuned German sports car , but the Tribeca did tie the Mazda for second-quickest acceleration times and beat all but the Highlander to 60 mph . The Tribeca may not sound like a Porsche , but it does brake like one . It out-stopped at least half the pack by 20 ft. or more . Passive safety features are vital , but nothing beats good brakes when it comes to avoiding an accident in the first place . Inside , the Tribeca is a slightly odd place to be . The curved dash is progressive and kind of weird . The gauges sit too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row get roomy accommodations but the third row is cramped and tough to access . It does have a split seat , so a camping trip with a family of six is n't out of the question . With more room and less funk , the Subaru would be a top pick . Photograph : Subaru restyled the Tribeca this year . But the basic profile remains taut and well proportioned . It was one of the sportiest in the group . FOURTH PLACE Toyota Highlander Limited The Highlander was one of the first car-based crossovers . And the new one is a marked improvement over the impressive original . If blowing the neighbor 's doors off is your priority , the Highlander is the best pick . The 270-hp 3.5-liter V6 is incredibly powerful and smooth . It was quickest by a wide margin and our favorite powerplant in the test . It 's rare that the quickest vehicle returns the best mileage . But the Toyota did just that . ( And the Highlander is the only one here that offers a hybrid drivetrain option . ) The zippy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite for squirting through traffic and fitting in those " compact " parking spots . It was a fun ride through the canyons , too . Inside , the nav system was praised by all testers , as were the big round knobs for the radio and climate control . Some , however , found the materials less luxurious than before . Toyota 's remodel of the Highlander includes some very handy features . There are pull levers near the tailgate that drop the second-row seats flat  --  perfect for impromptu trips to Costco . The second row on our tester also had the clever Center-Stow console , which allows the seat to become a three-person bench or two buckets . There 's also an extra rearview mirror for keeping an eye on back-seat brawls . But hauling lots of people is not this vehicle 's forte . The third-row seats do not split and are tight for adults . Worse , the cargo area is one of the smallest in this group . The good news ? The Highlander is a class leader  --  among five-passenger SUVs . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half size too small . Photograph : The Toyota was the quickest . But in this test , we valued room over vroom . Photograph : Real simple  --  just pull the lever and the seat folds flat . THIRD PLACE Saturn Outlook XR If hauling passengers and stuff is the only criterion , read no further . The Outlook is huge . It fits more people , more comfortably than any crossover on these pages  --  period . And , unlike most here , the Saturn can swallow massive amounts of cargo even with all the seats deployed . In that regard , it 's the most minivanesque hauler here . The seats flip , fold and slide to provide limousinelike access to the third row . Once back there , even Shaq could get comfy . The interior has tight panel gaps on the dash , soft-touch materials , and an upscale feel . The gauges are well-placed and easy to read . Dynamically , the Saturn is a shocker . A vehicle this big does n't have a right to move with such lan . One tester proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the engineers really did their homework . " On country roads the handling was tight and secure . But the sheer size of this big rig made parking-lot chores just that  --  a chore . On the freeway , the Saturn is particularly serene . It rides like it should have a Cadillac crest on its grille . The 275-hp 3.6-liter V6 never feels underpowered but it does have to work to move the 5000-pound SUV . It was the slowest of our group and had the longest stopping distances . The transmission is geared for fuel economy and has a tendency to lock on to the overdrive gear every chance it gets . Aggressive freeway driving results in constant hunting . If this test were titled , " Who 's got the roomiest SUV ? " the Saturn would win . But for us , its slightly cumbersome size just misses that sweet spot we think most buyers are looking for . Photograph : The engineers who designed the Saturn 's third row deserve a fat Christmas bonus . It was the roomiest and easiest to use . SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toyota , Honda and GM ? Well , ... yes . The Veracruz , Hyundai 's largest crossover , might be this Korean automaker 's best vehicle . Our Limited came with some very upscale features . There 's a whole cubby for your iPod , with a jack and plug for charging . The steering wheel has power tilt and telescope . The center console is refrigerated , so no more melted chocolate bars for the kiddies . And the perforated-leather seats keep mommies and daddies cool , too . There 's even overhead mood lighting and an illuminated doorsill plate  --  features normally found on luxury cars . The Veracruz rides softly on the freeway , yet grips challenging roads . Even with the stability-control system turned off , it delivered safe , dead-neutral handling . Our only complaint was the rather numb , on-center steering feel . The 3.8-liter V6 is stronger than the midpack acceleration times would suggest and it 's relatively hushed at redline , too . On our canyon-handling loop , high above Malibu , Calif. , the Veracruz had enough torque to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the Saturn , its third row was easy to get into . But it had a bit less space behind that seat . Luckily , the last row is a split-fold design so we only sacrificed one person to fit our largest Coleman cooler . Most of the Veracruz 's goodness can be had on the lower-grade models . So you can skip some features and still have one of the best seven-passenger crossovers on the market . Photograph : Cupholders are handy , but the Hyundai goes one step further with a refrigerated drink cooler . FIRST PLACE Mazda CX-9 Grand Touring The Mazda CX-9 was our unanimous winner . And it 's easy to see why . Beneath that taut , muscular bodywork is a chassis tuned to provide smiles when the road twists . It was the back-road hustler of the group . Under the sculpted hood sits a 263-hp 3.5-liter V6 , which helped the Mazda earn second-quickest times in the quarter-mile and second-best fuel economy . Its six-speed transmission , like the steering and suspension , encourages frisky behavior . It 's usually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , precise downshift . In this test , the gold-medal winner must do more . The sweptback roofline says " no room back here . " But somehow , the CX9 is one of the most spacious . Third-row-seat access and comfort are second only to that of the gargantuan Saturn . The middle seat slides easily forward , allowing a wide walkway to the " way back . " It 's a great gear hauler , too . With all seven seats occupied , it can still pack all the trimmings necessary for a family outing to the beach . Is the Mazda completely faultless ? Nope . Our test model was delivered with fwd instead of all-wheel drive ( which would add another grand to the sticker ) . A snowy driveway could pose a challenge to a CX-9 . Particularly with the urban-chic 20-in. wheels and low-profile tires , it 's not our first choice for a rough road . In fact , the Mazda rode a bit too stiff , thanks to those " dubs . " Still , the CX-9 most cohesively satisfies a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving , and wraps it all in a downright sexy package . <p>
