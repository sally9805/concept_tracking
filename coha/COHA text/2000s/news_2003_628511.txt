<p> TYLER Hobson vividly remembers that day a couple of years ago when he walked into the University of Michigan 's weight room and saw the Wolverines using his equipment . <p> All of a sudden , he remembered why he 'd worked two jobs for almost a decade , why he 'd learned to live on three hours of sleep , why he 'd seen so little of his family and why he did n't give up when no one seemed much interested . <p> And then that day , he saw the Wolverines using his leg press , the one he was convinced was better than any on the market , the one that would put less stress on the joints and allow players to get stronger quicker . <p> With a drawer full of rejection slips and a book of unreturned telephone calls , he could not help but smile . <p> " That was probably the high point , " he said . " You do n't get into that weight room unless you 've got something pretty good . That 's when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the design work at his Conroe home , often rising at 3 a.m. for three or four hours before reporting to his regular job at a Conroe ceramics factory . He 'd bought the steel and the roller bearings , did the cutting , drilled the holes and went through dozens of prototypes before finally getting it right . <p> " I ca n't count how many I designed , thought it would be right and then ended up taking a blowtorch and cutting it in pieces , " he said . <p> When he finally got one right , he gave a few dozen away before convincing Michigan to buy one , and before shipping it , he made sure he had the color - Michigan 's colors - just right . <p> He bolted it together and tested it in a nondescript corner of a Conroe storage facility where he still spends 18 or more hours most days welding , drawing , cutting and constructing . <p> All for that moment in Ann Arbor . <p> In an industry filled with multimillion-dollar corporations and sometimes vicious competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbowed its way in among the giants . <p> Later , there would be other special moments . <p> He would take pride in knowing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers used his equipment during their run to the Super Bowl . <p> He would hear from Bucs fullback Mike Alstott , who thought so much of the Pendulum leg-press machine that he bought one for his home . <p> He would hear from offensive lineman Randall McDaniel , who asked him to help furnish his home weight room after retiring from the NFL . <p> He would hear Denver Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe announce that the Pendulum squat machine is one of the reasons he 's still an elite player at age 34 . <p> He would receive orders from from a hotel in Kuwait City , a health club in Austria and a host of other places . <p> What began as his goal of doing one thing better than anyone else ended up with a classic pursuit of the American dream . <p> These days , the Houston Texans are regular customers . <p> " He has provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach Dan Riley said . " It 's only a tool . We still have to put it to use , but it 's a way to get stronger . " <p> Hobson 's customer list includes the Jacksonville Jaguars , Detroit Lions , Baltimore Ravens , Philadelphia Eagles , New York Giants , Cincinnati Bengals and others . <p> Notre Dame , Michigan State , Air Force and Penn State are among a long list of college and high schools using Pendulum . <p> He has a backlog of orders and attempts to fill them even as he continues to design new equipment when he 's not building a piece or driving to , for instance , Cincinnati , as he did last week , to make a delivery . <p> He has given up his second job , dreams of a day when he can streamline the manufacturing process and still wonders if a passion can turn a profit - but he 's still at it . <p> When Jacksonville Jaguars strength coach Mark Asanovich telephoned at 4 one recent morning , he 'd planned on leaving a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We were both already in our offices , " Hobson said . " I guess it 's a sickness . " <p> That " sickness " is one of the reasons NFL people are so impressed . <p> " In my field , what happens a lot of times is the cookie-cutter approach , " said Asanovich . " These big manufacturers say , ' Here 's our product , take it or leave it . ' Tyler comes in and says : ' How can I help you ? What can I design that 's best for your athletes ? ' That 's pretty impressive . <p> " I 'm totally ignorant about design , but I know what I want . He 's a guy who makes it a reality . Beyond his skills and design is his passion for what he does . When people have a sincere love for what they 're doing , that 's huge . " <p> When a reporter jokes about his being the classic American story of being rewarded for building a better mousetrap , Hobson interrupts . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I 'm still not certain about making this a profitable business , but I do have a passion for it . " <p> Hobson grew up outside Anchorage , Alaska , where his father was in the oil business . He graduated from high school and went to work in the oil industry himself . He was transferred to Houston , laid off and enrolled at Sam Houston State when a part-time job at the ceramics factory turned into a full-time gig . <p> In his spare time , he became a competitive weight lifter and was so good at it that his office is lined with an array of trophies . <p> Because he was training at home , his garage became so cluttered with weight-lifting equipment that his wife , Traci , implored him to throw some of it away , or at least give her enough room to park her car . <p> He had a better idea . <p> Instead of dozens of work stations , he 'd build a multi-station weight-lifting machine that would incorporate a dozen or so different exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would sell the machines to trainers and health clubs around the country . Instead of rows of weight-lifting equipment , health clubs could purchase his one piece and be set . <p> He would create a new wave and would ride that wave to fame and fortune . <p> He spent two years building a prototype machine in his spare time , sometimes sleeping an hour or two at night . Then he placed it in a trailer and drove around the country visiting conventions and personal trainers , believing he 'd discovered the next great thing . <p> " I thought it would be a new trend and I 'd be able to catch that wave , " he said . " That seemed to be something that was coming about . I was wrong . I did not sell any of them . " <p> Yet one day while showing off the station , one guy told him : " Hey , I like that squat machine you have on there . If you could just build one of those , I 'd buy one . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He sold a couple of the squat machines and heard such rave reviews that he believed he 'd found the thing that would get his company off the ground . <p> He began calling potential customers . <p> " Some people begin trying to sell to high schools and then work their way up , " he said . " I started at the top . " <p> Sometimes his calls were returned . Most times , they were n't . <p> Instead of making sales , he began shipping the equipment to schools with big-time weight-lifting programs , telling them that if they did n't like the stuff he 'd send a truck and haul it back to Texas . <p> He also telephoned Asanovich , then the strength and conditioning coach for the Buccaneers . <p> He asked for five minutes of his time . <p> " Come on down , " he was told . <p> " I was shocked , " Hobson said . <p> He hurriedly assembled a couple of pieces , packed them in a trailer , asked for a couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Asanovich was n't sold on what he saw . But he was sold on Hobson . <p> He suggested some design changes and sent Hobson back to Conroe . When he left Tampa , Hobson believed he 'd opened a door into the NFL . <p> He had . While Asanovich tested the prototype machines , other teams began to purchase it . <p> Michigan became a customer . Then Notre Dame . And Air Force . <p> As strength coaches gossiped , his name became familiar , and where he once begged for five minutes , he now regularly fields calls from teams asking to place an order . <p> His five machines sell for anywhere from $ 895 to $ 2,900 . He has designed five more he hopes to have on the market within a couple of years . He still builds every piece himself . <p> " Relationships are the key to what I do , " Hobson said . " I do n't have a lot of money . I drive 23 hours , and the coaches let me sleep on their couches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're millionaires , either . They seem to live pretty modestly . Most of them are incredible people . <p> " The thing about these NFL guys is that if they have something really good that they like , they 'll talk about it . If they have something they really do n't like , they 'll talk about it . I 've been able to stay small and yet have a strong presence . " <p> How is Pendulum better ? For one thing , the machines are custom-built . Athletes tell him his machines are more comfortable and put less stress on the joints . <p> " I 've made machines that can be adjusted to fit the lifter , " Hobson said . " The problem with machines is that they 're very linear . When you take different bone lengths , it can interrupt with the line of movement of the machine . You have shear factors on the knees . It may feel good to someone 5-4 , but not to someone 6-4 . By having a machine that would adjust to their height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . They can squat in complete comfort . You have the benefit of a machine with the effect of a free-weight squat . No one had done that before . <p> " I had enough experts , like Anthony Clark , the first person to squat over 1,000 pounds , say they were blown away by it . The players are thoroughbreds . They 're elite genetic athletes . They 're incredible - and very valuable . The better-conditioned they are , hopefully the more injury-free they 'll stay . And hopefully , that could add longevity to their career . Everything has to be joint-friendly . " <p> One strength coach tells Hobson his is a " boutique " weight-lifting business . <p> " I do n't know if I want to have a ' boutique , ' " he said , " but I appreciate what he meant . " <p> He meant customer service , which extends in a lot of different directions . When a piece broke on an Eagles machine last season , Hobson dropped what he was doing , flew to Philadelphia and repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the orders by telephone and is on a first-name basis with a dozen or so NFL coaches . When the Baltimore Ravens played in Houston last fall , their strength coach left with a box of her homemade chocolates . <p> " When I pack the truck to make a delivery , she gives me homemade salsa to take to the coaches , " Tyler Hobson said . " She exchanges recipes with a few of them . " <p> Without the security of a primary job , he frets about how to make it work . He has established a loyal , growing client base , so much so that he has been forced to limit the orders on some machines simply because he ca n't get them all built . <p> He plans to hire at least one full-time employee by the end of the year and has some part-time people around the country who 've agreed to go set up the equipment in various weight rooms . <p> Until then , it 's he and his wife and other family members . <p> " You work all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , " he said . " And then you drive hundreds of miles to deliver it . A coach or an athlete gets on it and says , ' Wow , this is incredible . ' At that point , you 've achieved such a sense of satisfaction . To make a living doing this is a dream . That 's what I hope to do . It 's really a passion . " <p> Some large manufacturers appear to be attempting to copy his designs , but he says : " They will never do what I do because they ca n't . When I 've tried to mass produce pieces , that 's when I 've gotten in trouble . " <p> Still , he has goals . <p> " Eventually , I 'd like to have 10 pieces to sell , " he said . " I 've got five now , and that 's not enough to attract a sales force . I 'd like a more refined manufacturing system . Right now , it 's just me and family sitting here putting it together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . I want to be a small custom manufacturer . <p> " I want it to be a tool that everyone wants to get their hands on . " <p> <p> WHY PENDULUM BELIEVES IT 'S DIFFERENT <p> 1 . Each piece of equipment is custom-built . <p> 2 . Machines provide more resistance training while putting less stress on joints . <p> 3 . Design is done with prototype models instead of computer mock-ups . <p> 4 . Customer service is handled by the designer and manufacturer . <p> TYPE : Biography ; Profile
