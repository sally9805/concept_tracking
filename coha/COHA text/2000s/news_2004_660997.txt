<p> It sounds like a great deal : Buy a car and finance it for five , six , or even seven years . Payments are smaller . You can buy more car . And automakers and banks make it easy to do . <p> So what 's the hitch ? Long-term debt . <p> By not paying off their loans fast enough , car owners run two financial risks down the road . They could end up still owing money on their old car when they go to buy a new one . Worse , they might owe more on their vehicle than it is worth . <p> Such problems have become more pronounced as the price of new cars has risen - to more than $ 25,000 on average last year - and auto companies have eased credit terms to keep cars moving off the lot . <p> " It 's a vicious cycle , " says Peter Humleker , a former auto dealer and now consumer advocate and author of the e-book " Car Buying Scams . " " Consumers just keep digging themselves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out is to buy a less expensive car or to hang onto the old one until it 's paid off , says Rob Gentile , head of the car-buying service at Consumer Reports . <p> Last week , Warner Smith bought a 2004 Honda Civic to commute to his computer-networking job in Elgin , Ill . Looking for low payments , he signed up for a five-year , 2.9 percent loan . Since the interest rate was no lower for shorter-term loans , Mr. Smith decided to go long term with payments just under $ 300 a month . But " I 'm keeping my options open , " he says . He 's now considering forking out $ 370 each month to pay off the loan in three years - a route some financing experts say is worthwhile . <p> By accepting longer loan terms , more and more consumers end up buying new cars while still making payments on their old ones . In 2004 , 38 percent of shoppers who bought a new car on credit still owed an average of $ 3,686 on their trade-in , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif . As a result , the money they owed on their trade-in was often rolled into the payments on the new car . <p> By signing up for long-term financing , " you 're making a commitment that you 're keeping this car around quite some time , " says Mr. Gentile . <p> Nevertheless , after a few years , many buyers ' financial situation or automotive needs have changed , experts say . Others , still in debt after the warranty expires , face big repair bills on top of monthly car payments . <p> At the root of the phenomenon is the easy credit that dealers and bankers have been offering for car loans . <p> After 9/11 , automakers raced to shore up sales with zero percent financing and big cash incentives . Thezero interest loans were offered mostly over periods of three years or less . Only buyers with solid credit records qualified . Rates for longer-term loans were higher . <p> Now , the average new-car loan runs 62 months , up from 50 months in 2001 , according to a recent Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.D. Power and Associates . <p> " The terms of the transaction are all working to make the consumer 's financial situation worse , " says Tom Libby , a PIN analyst in Troy , Mich . <p> One other problem : Cars are depreciating faster because dealers are slapping discounts on new models . Those discounts averaged $ 2,367 last month , down from last July 's record , but still historically high , according to Edmunds.com . Because the market is flooded with new cars , the market for used models has shriveled . <p> Even without accelerated depreciation , a seven-year loan encourages buyers to pay off their cars more slowly than they depreciate . Owing more for a car than it is worth is known in the industry as being financially " upside down . " ( Bankers call it being " under water . " ) To make matters worse , longer loan terms often come with a higher interest rate . Rolling money owed on a trade-in into a new-car loan raises that rate further . <p> Many buyers who opt for long-term loans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're trying to buy more car than they can afford , " says Phil Reed , Edmunds.com 's consumer-advice editor and author of " Strategies for Smart Car Buyers . " " Many car-shoppers today are making the mistake of thinking in terms of monthly payments rather than total cost . " <p> Automakers say loans that last more than five years represent a small part of their business and are targeted at buyers of expensive " specialty " vehicles , such as conversion vans . At General Motors Acceptance Corp. , GM 's finance arm , only 1 percent of vehicles are financed for longer than 60 months . <p> " This is a marketplace dynamic , " driven by what consumers know they can afford , says David Jones , vice president of planning with GMAC . " There are some situations where you have to go for the longer term for affordability . The consumer has to do the research . " <p> More buyers seem to sign up for long-term loans on foreign cars , perhaps because of their reputation for reliability . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run longer than 60 months . <p> Auto financing terms longer than five years are even more prevalent among " second-tier Japanese brands , " such as Mitsubishi , Isuzu , and Suzuki , says Gentile , as well as Korean brands , because those companies cater to less wealthy buyers . Some of these cars depreciate as much as 50 percent in their first year on the road . <p> Many of these buyers might have considered leasing in the past . But starting in 2002 , automakers pushed low-rate , long-term financing with unprecedented loan lengths of up to 84 months . ( Few buyers who took those loans had good enough credit to qualify for the best interest rates , Gentile says . ) <p> Prior to that , automakers had encountered the same financial difficulties that many car owners now face . By emphasizing vehicle leases , car companies found that when cars were turned in at the end of the lease , they were n't worth as much as they had expected . Carmakers have now shifted this depreciation risk to consumers by subsidizing long-term financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 , leasing fell from 19.2 percent of the market to 13.2 percent , while financing grew from 44.1 percent to 52.5 percent , according to data from Edmunds.com . Leasing has made something of a comeback in the past few weeks , and some dealers are now offering five-year leases . <p> For those who find themselves stuck in a long-term loan , the best course of action is to do whatever possible to pay off the loan early , says Jim Teahn , a spokesman for MyVesta , a consumer financial-education organization . If you 're thinking of signing up , hold off until you can build up a bigger down payment , he urges . <p> How to buy a great new car without the heavy debt <p> As more and more consumers use long-term loans to buy new cars , they 're finding that they end up owing more than the car is worth . <p> To avoid that trap , consider these alternatives before you sign on the dotted line : <p> * Find a cheaper car . Hard as this advice may be to stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , experts emphasize . You should n't buy more car than you can afford . <p> While many consumers today still crave sport utility vehicles , minivans are often cheaper , offer more room , and provide better fuel economy . In addition , American and Korean manufacturers offer solid cars that sell for thousands of dollars less than their Japanese and European counterparts . And their quality is improving . <p> * Consider a car with the lowest depreciation rate possible . Consumer Reports and several personal finance magazines including Kiplinger and Money publish predicted depreciation rates . Intellichoice.com also calculates how a car will depreciate for a fee . <p> * Save up for a bigger down payment . A rule of thumb is every additional $ 1,000 you put down on a car lowers your monthly payments by about $ 50 a month . <p> More money may also enable you to shorten the length of the loan and , as a result , obtain a lower interest rate . <p> * If you do n't drive a lot of miles and take good care of your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment and usually do n't last longer than three to five years . <p> But leasing has its disadvantages , including mileage limitations and the fact that you wo n't own the car at the end of the term . <p> * If you already are stuck with an auto loan that extends 60 months or more , do everything possible to make extra payments to pay down the principal . Jim Teahn of MyVesta , a consumer financial-education organization , notes that you may have to call the finance company to find out where to send extra payments so they 're not just applied to the next month 's interest . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
