Sorceress By Celia Rees Candlewick Celia Rees  --  MARY  - -  Massachusetts , November 1660 If I am a witch , they will soon know it . I had never ill wished anyone , but as I fled Beulah , anger and hatred clashed together , sparking curses like steel striking flint . I had done no wrong , so why was I forced to run like a fugitive ? My accusers , Deborah Vane and the other girls , they were the guilty ones . Even as they denounced me as a witch , their eyes gleamed with scheming malice . The madness twisting their faces was counterfeit . Who could not see it ? " Them that 's blind and will not see . " My grandmother 's words came to me . She was a wise woman , but her wisdom brought her nothing but sorrow . She ended her life on the hanging tree , and now the same fate awaited me . They searched , and that most diligently . I cowered in Rebekah 's borning room , thinking to be safe for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices ringing loud with right and duty . Only Martha stood against them , defying Reverend Johnson as brave as a robin before a striking hawk . They went away reluctantly . I tracked them searching through the rest of the house , moving from one room to the next , their heavy tread freighted with hatred . I got away , but they searched for me still . I heard them hallooing through the woods , saw their torches , tiny bonfire sparks in the blackness . I heard the dogs baying and yelling . Dogs run faster than men . Snow started falling soonafter I fled the town , icy pellets seeding the wind . It began to come thick , ever-more whitening the ground , making it easier for the dogs to pick me out . The first to come upon me was old Tom , Josiah Crompton 's hunting dog . He 's a gazehound , hunting by sight . Old Tom came leaping out of the brush toward me and threw back his long , bony head , making a sound deep in his throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This brought the other dogs tumbling to him . They stood ringed about , tongues lolling , eyes bright . They had me cornered . I backed against a tree and stared at them , waiting for them to spring . Tom crept nearer , the others following , the circle tightening , then he stopped . He stood , head inclined , his short ears cocked as if harking to some sound . The men 's shouting was nearer now . I thought that was what he was hearing and that at any minute he would commence barking , but he did not . He gave me one last look , wheeled around , and made off with all the others streaming after him in a rag and tag mob . The baying and yelling thinned to nothing . Tom had led the hunt away from me . I was alone again in the forest 's frosty silence . I thought to run on , but tiredness overcame me . I sank down , leaning my back against the tree 's rough bark , intending to gather what strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The snow is still falling , drifting through the air and making no sound , feathering across my cheeks like angel fingers , weighting my eyelids , settling upon me , covering me like a counterpane filled with the finest down . I feel no cold , but I can not move . My limbs have no feeling in them . To sleep is to die , I know that , but I can not keep awake . Sometimes I almost hope that they might come back this way , that they might find me , but I dismiss the thought as soon as it arises . I 'd rather die here than be taken . I 'd rather freeze to this tree than be hanged .  --  AGNES  - -  Boston , Massachusetts , April , Present Day Agnes fell forward , cracking her head sharply on the glass . The screen saver jarred and jerked , just for a second , then the monitor went black and she was looking at her own face staring back , eyes dilated by more than the pain in her forehead . What had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was freezing . Her fingers were bloodless and withered , the nails blue . She looked to the window , expecting to see snow falling , but there was nothing . The sky was a clear evening blue . Whatever had just happened was as real as any experience of her own , anything that she had ever known . She could not stop shivering . She got up and dragged the quilt off the bed . The quilt was serviceable as well as beautiful , a bright Lone Star , Aunt M 's farewell gift to her . Agnes gripped the edges tight , wrapping it close around her , but still she could not get warm . Teeth chattering , she went to the window , opening it onto the quad below . Sodium streetlights were coming on , bronzing the leaves on the trees . Across the way , desk lamps were beginning to show in the windows of rows of little rooms just like her own . She closed the window and in the gathering darkness shifted her focus , turning the glass into a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agnes put her hand up , sweeping back her jet-black hair . She wore it long , past her shoulders . She was only eighteen , but already a few silver hairs were threading down from the parting . She would have a white streak there , just as her aunt had , and her grandmother before her . She frowned , thick dark brows drawing down . The eyes beneath were gray , rimmed with black  --  unusual , particularly in her family . The color of her eyes and her faraway gaze had caused her grandmother to name her Karonhisake , Searching Sky . No one called her that here . To her fellow students , to the staff and faculty , she was Agnes Herne . The only time her tribal name was used was when she was back on the reservation . She did not seek to hide her Native American blood . She did not disguise it ; neither did she advertise it . It was who she was . She went home as often as time and vacations would allow , but she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her life in separate compartments . Continues ... by Celia Rees
