As lightening flashes intermittently in an otherwise clear sky , a group of more than 200 Marines begins to gear up on a dusty plain outside the Iraqi city of Fallujah . Officers bark orders , directing grunts into their vehicles . Tank drivers climb into turrets and crank up heavy-metal tunes . Infantrymen who moments earlier had been asking about baseball scores exhort one another to move forward . " This is what you trained for , Marine ! " " You 're the hunter ! You 're the predator ! " <P> As the group prepared to move last Thursday on the city that has most bedeviled the U.S. occupation , the hyperbole seemed appropriate . Fallujah is the presumed base of Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi , the most potent terrorist in Iraq . And more than 100 suspected insurgents have been arrested in recent weeks in nearby villages . Now the 3rd Battalion , 5th Marines along with the Army 's Brigade Combat Team 2 and a company from the 2nd Tank Battalion  --  a combined force exceeding 1,000 troops  --  were about to launch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enter the city but intended to go right up to the southeastern outskirts . The Army would move to the southwestern edge and the tankers to the northern limits , while F/A-18s continued to pound suspected insurgent hideouts . Yet this was not the big showdown everyone had expected but rather an attempt to see how the insurgents inside the city would respond . A Marine battle-operations officer called it " a dress rehearsal " for the ultimate combat . This was a scouting mission , a risk-filled feint supported by air power , an attempt to get an edge for the eventual showdown . <P> The latest counterinsurgency effort began in a week that included the start of Ramadan and saw the U.S. military  --  primarily the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force  --  move boldly to try to subdue the rebellion raging in Fallujah and Ramadi , the two most restive towns in Anbar , Iraq 's most restive province . New forces were brought in , new strategies employed . But despite clear successes , the week 's record of strikes and counterstrikes suggests that if , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey is dictating the nature of the hunt . <P> The assault had begun in Ramadi two days earlier , when much of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marines joined the lite 36th Battalion of the Iraqi National Guard and their U.S. special- forces advisers to raid seven mosques in the city . As in Fallujah , attempts to prop up a local government in Ramadi have faltered amid violence , kidnappings and assassinations . Military bases in both places are frequently mortared . Unlike in Fallujah , though , in Ramadi the Marines are a regular presence in the streets . And they are hit daily by a mostly invisible enemy , bountifully armed with improvised explosive devices ( IEDS ) , rocket-propelled grenades ( RPGs ) and automatic weapons . Most attacks occur on Ramadi 's main road , dubbed Route Michigan . ( When asked if they 're in control of the city , a roomful of grunts responds with phrases like " Oh , f no ! " ) The mosques offer support and sanctuary to fighters , the Marines say . Calls to attack Americans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' loudspeakers.
