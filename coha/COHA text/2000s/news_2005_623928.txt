<p> San Francisco 's homicide rate is at its highest level in years . Community policing is touted as the solution . Plans to implement the program , however , have been thwarted by disputes over who ought to run it , what it should accomplish and who will staff it . . <p> With San Francisco 's homicide rate at its highest level in a decade , city officials are looking to a renewed community policing program as a way to both stem bloodshed and build trust for law enforcement in violence-plagued neighborhoods such as the Bayview and Western Addition . <p> But it 's been four months since Mayor Gavin Newsom and Police Chief Heather Fong announced the plan , and to date little has been done to put it in place . As the number of killings has crept this year to 95  --  seven more than the total for all of 2004  --  the city has only sporadically increased foot and bicycle patrols , key elements of any community policing plan . It has yet to implement what other cities refer to as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model is that the more officers who make themselves visible and regularly deal with seemingly minor problems  --  such as broken windows , graffiti and loitering  --  the better police can insulate neighborhoods from serious crimes such as murder . <p> In San Francisco , however , the community policing plan has become bogged down in staffing shortages . Now , it is the focus of a dispute between leaders in the African American community , the police chief and the mayor 's office over what the program should accomplish and who should lead it . <p> " What we 're so upset about is that this could have and would have had an impact on the murders , " said Jim Queen , who sits on the city 's juvenile probation board and is a member of the African American Community Police Relations Board , a 13-member panel representing community and religious leaders . <p> " Everybody is jumping up and down , wringing their hands , holding candlelight vigils , asking , what can you do ? " Queen said . " We have put forward a plan that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of them being viewed as an occupying force . " <p> Newsom and Fong first mentioned the initiative in August , after a rash of killings in the Western Addition . A major feature would commit 20 police lieutenants  --  two from each of the 10 district stations  --  to work to " rebuild trust and communication " by creating community-policing plans and implementing them . <p> " Right now , you 'll see that people talk about this anecdotally , that they see a police cruiser as it drives around  --  it does not stop and not ask questions or bond with the community , " said Gabe Cabrera , a legislative analyst with the Board of Supervisors who did a report in October on San Francisco 's community policing efforts . <p> " I would want to see more police officers on the street  --  just walking by , connecting with the citizens , connecting with me , saying , ' How are you today ? ' " Cabrera said . <p> The idea has strong appeal in the Bayview and Western Addition , where many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed by the Western Addition 's representative on the Board of Supervisors , Ross Mirkarimi . <p> " We as a city are n't doing enough , " Mirkarimi said . " We do n't have a definition of what community policing is in San Francisco , nothing in the code  --  if there is nothing in the code , nobody is going to be held accountable . " <p> Part of the delay in getting a plan in place stems from the Police Department 's staffing shortages . The department has just 57 beats dedicated to foot and bicycle patrols . Overall , however , the department is 264 officers short of the 1,971-officer minimum set by voters , and there are 59 vacancies in the inspectors bureau . <p> " You ca n't effectively do community policing when you 're 300 officers short , " said Gary Delagnes , president of the Police Officers Association , " because the Police Department 's No. 1 responsibility is to respond to calls for service . " <p> But even the department 's plans to steer 20 lieutenants into community policing have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should run the program and how much power that person should have . <p> Minister Christopher Muhammed , head of San Francisco 's Nation of Islam church as well as the African American Community Police Relations Board , wants the director to answer only to Fong . He and Queen also had a candidate in mind , a 19-year veteran lieutenant named Con Johnson . <p> Johnson , who now works out of the patrol office , has long touted community policing as a way to improve the department 's often-strained relationship with the African American community . He declined to comment for this story , citing orders from the chief . <p> The lieutenant has the backing of the African American Community Police Relations Board because " he is somebody who is trusted within the black , Asian and Latino community , " Queen said . " He has always treated people with the utmost respect . " <p> The African American panel thought it had a deal with the mayor 's office under which Johnson would have the power to direct the captains of district stations and hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of director , which Queen said would mean he would have the authority to make the plan happen . <p> Fong , on the other hand , wanted the captains in charge of district stations to report to her , and for Johnson to be more of a coordinator than a director . " The chief did n't seem to be on the same page as what the mayor was saying , " Queen said . " We had an agreement with the mayor . The chief talked about business as usual . " <p> Fong declined in an interview to address disputes about Johnson 's role . She said the department was committed to community policing , and that " as our staffing increases , we will be able to do more . " The chief is pushing to hire 250 officers a year for the next three years . <p> The mayor 's office conceded that there have been differences over how to implement community policing . " I think we 're moving forward , " said Peter Ragone , Newsom 's press secretary . " We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by the residents . We are in the process of putting together such a program . " <p> Ragone said the mayor and the chief are keenly aware of staffing shortages and " agree we need to hire more officers . " Those efforts have been hobbled , however , by a freeze on police promotions that City Hall ordered because of an $8 million overrun in the department 's budget . That freeze means many key positions  --  some needed to implement community policing  --  have either remained vacant or have been filled by acting supervisors . <p> Cabrera said the staffing shortage is a " huge , real problem for them . ... Community policing , in terms of staffing , is the first to go when there are not enough officers in the field . " <p> Mirkarimi , however , said a lack of resources should not derail structural change . " We can get creative about staffing , moving officers from the airport or moving officers in from other stations , " he said , " where they are not suffering like other hot pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department scores well on some aspects of broken-windows policing , such as exceeding the level of community policing training mandated by the state and providing crime data to the public through the department 's Web site . <p> But the department falls short in another key area of community policing , Cabrera said  --  meeting with community members and leaders to set priorities and organize residents to help solve neighborhood problems . <p> While the department has made efforts to reach out , he said , such meetings have lacked focus and often turn into sessions at which residents simply vent . <p> " Meeting for meeting 's sake , I do n't think that is going to work , " Cabrera said . " San Francisco would be the perfect location for a terrific program . I 'm surprised it 's not already a great city for community policing .
