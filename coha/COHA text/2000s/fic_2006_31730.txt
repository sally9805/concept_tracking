Dating Is Murder By Harley Jane Kozak Random House Harley Jane Kozak 1 " Moth harmonica . " That 's what it sounded like , the guttural , heavy-accented syllables coming through my answering machine . A piece of haiku , until the woman rattled off an almost unintelligible series of digits that went on and on , like a credit card number or the miles from earth to Jupiter . I picked up the telephone . " Hi , this is Wollie , " I said . " Who 's this ? " " California ? America ? Ja ? " " Yes , California , America . Who 's this ? " " Encino ? " " No , not Encino , West Hollywood . Forty minutes away , traffic permitting . Who 's this ? " " Ja , ja , who this ? " she asked . " That 's what I 'm asking , " I said . " Who are you ? " " I am Moth Harmonica . " Okay , I 've heard worse . My own name , Wollstonecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or woman , as my friend Fredreeq insists I refer to myself . " Who are you trying to call , Moth ? " I asked . " Who are you ? " " No , who are " I stopped . This could take a while , and I did n't have a while . " I think you have the wrong number , " I said , and this brought forth a flurry of words that started with " Nein ! Nein ! " and ended with " Annika . " " Annika ? " I said . " Wait . Not mothyou'remother . Of Annika . You 're Mrs. Glck ? " There was an excited assent , lots of Ja ! Ja ! s , and another flurry of words . I closed my eyes and took a deep breath , trying to dispel a sudden bad feeling . " Meine Annika , " Mrs. Glck said , " called not tomorrow-no , no , yesterday-and yesterday is Sunday , we call every week Sunday . So I leave message for host family , but called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um , danger , sie ist in big danger , as sie call not Sunday . " I was nodding now . My friend Annika had called her mother from my apartment the previous week . " She would freak out if I did not call each Sunday , " Annika had said . " But she will call me back so it will not be on your bill . " Which was why Mrs. Glck had my number . I said , " I 'd really like to help you , but I have no idea where Annika is . She 's tutoring me in math , and we were supposed to meet last night " -I hesitated , not wanting to admit how I 'd worried , thinking , Annika 's never even late " and she did n't show . " " Ah , Gott im Himmel , sie is dead . " " No , I 'm sure she 's not dead , I 'm sure she 's " The doorbell rang . " Can you hold on ? " I zipped through the kitchen and living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give me two minutes , and zipped back to the kitchen . " Mrs. Glck ? " I said . " I 'm sure Annika will turn up , and if I hear from her first " " Nein , nein , for me you must to find her . The host family call me not back , and the agency call me not back , no one in United States of America to " " But if she 's really missing , I 'm sure her host family will contact the police " " Nein , no Polizei , no troubleyou are friend , ja ? So you are to ask host family what is happen . For my daughter . Mein Kind . " Fredreeq , having followed me into the kitchen , pointed to her watch and mouthed the words " Joey " and " double-parked . " I nodded and waved her off . " Okay , " I said . " Do you have the host family 's number ? All I have is Annika 's line , with her machine . " On which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up and turned to Fredreeq , who was studying the contents of my refrigerator . It was early evening in late November , dark in my kitchen , but my friend was illuminated by the utility bulb . It was enough . She wore a tight , fringed jumpsuit in hot pink , low-cut with a big plastic zipper running the length of it . She had the kind of va-va-va-boom body that could pull this off , and the kind of temperament that would want to . Her hair this week was as blond as mine , not unusual in Los Angeles , but whereas I had pale skin to go with it , Fredreeq was black , a less common combination . " Where 's your water ? " she asked . " In the sink . " " You do n't have bottled water ? What do you take on the road ? " " I do n't take water on the road . " " Sister , you have got to change your ways , " she said , herding me into the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica person ? " " Annika , not Monica . Our Annika , from the show . Her mother in Germany says she'sdisappeared . " I grabbed my keys and backpack , alarmed at the word I 'd just said . " And who does the mother think you are , the FBI ? " " She does n't know who I am , she just happened to have my phone number . She ca n't reach the host family-Annika 's an au pair , did you know that ? " Fredreeq handed me my jean jacket . " What are you doing answering your own phone ? We got ta get you thinking like a celebrity . " The word " celebrity " made me want to hide under the bed with a bag of Oreos . But Fredreeq had overstated it . I was only a celebrity to those rare people who watched a TV reality show called Biological Clocktoo few in number , according to the Nielsen ratings , to materially affect my life . I reminded myself of this as I followed Fredreeq out of the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rush-hour noise from Santa Monica Boulevard accosted us . There was pedestrian traffic too as we walked down Larrabee , mostly male , as befits a neighborhood known as Boystown . Fredreeq attracted her share of attention , her skintight jumpsuit an object of desire . West Hollywood is a bastion of gay and lesbian culture , which I , as a heterosexual female , found comforting in ways I did n't exactly understand . I caught myself really looking at people , on the street , in cars . Looking , illogically , maybe , for someone considerably shorter than I , brown-haired , apple-cheeked , pretty . A girl in the last days of her teens . Annika . " There 's Joey , " Fredreeq said , waving to a green Mercedes stuck in slow traffic on Santa Monica , a mass of red hair visible in the driver 's seat . " What 's she doing circling the block ? I told her to stay put . C'm on , let 's catch up . " She grabbed my hand and we ran as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My friends were driving me to the night 's location of Biological Clock . The reality show featured three women d'un certain ge , as Joey put it , dating in rotation three men of various ages , so the TV audience could ultimately vote on which combination of genes should produce a child , with or without romantic involvement on the part of the chosen couple . I was one of the women . It had n't been my idea . Here 's how it happened . I 'd beenokay , still wasrecovering from a broken engagement to a guy named Doc . Doc had some issues that stood between him and marriage , namely , a wife and the certainty of an ugly custody battle for their daughter , Ruby , once the wife became an ex-wife . The wife was keeping Ruby in Japan , so Doc had taken a job in Taiwan to be nearby , production work on an American film called Mao , the Movie , which threatened to go on as long as the Cultural Revolution . Custody would be a problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt I should n't wait for him . Joey and Fredreeq agreed . I felt otherwise , but nobody seemed to care about my opinions any more than Chairman Mao had cared about the opinions of the bourgeoisie . Joey 's husband , meanwhile , had invested money in this reality show , Biological Clock , which had inspired Joey and Fredreeq to send my audition video to the casting director . I had n't known I 'd made an audition video . I 'd thought I was being interviewed for Fredreeq 's niece 's sociology project . Apparently , though , me talking about my dating history was compelling stuff . Also , I was the right age and had attributesbig chest , long legs , and height , six feet of itthat made a nice visual contrast to the other two front-runner women contestants , and I 'd thus beaten out several hundred hopefuls for the job . Not that I 'd wanted the job . I 'd turned it down flat once it was explained to me . I found the premise of the show cheesy , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple would be required to have sex or bear children . As for fame , I 'd have been happy to fork over my fifteen minutes to someone else , the way senators give away their floor time in debates to fellow senators . But then Biological Clock had mentioned money . Despite the low budget , I 'd be paid five hundred dollars a week for two nights ' work , unusual for reality TV . And that was n't all . The producers had invested in a number of other businesses , including a health maintenance organization offering benefits to the winning contestants and their dependents , current and future . Some people say insurance is n't sexy , but for those with dependent paranoid schizophrenic brothers on pricey antipsychotic medication , it 's sexy enough . A horn honked . " Girl , you got some kind of bad gene that makes you change lanes every twenty seconds ? " Fredreeq asked Joey . " Yeah , it 's called effective driving . " " Well , maybe they do that in Nebraska to get around the cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fredreeq and Joey had an ongoing city mouse , country mouse routine , although Joey was no more country than any other ex-model/actress who 'd lived in L.A. , New York , and Paris for the last fifteen years . " And can we turn down this twangy banjo stuff ? You want people to think you 're a hick ? " " I am a hick . Hey , Wollie , " Joey threw over her shoulder , " why so quiet ? " " Cell phone . " I 'd dialed the number Mrs. GlYck had given me for Annika 's host family . In Encino , a machine answered . The voice was warm , chatty , female . " Hi there . You 've reached the Quinns . Gene , Maizie , Emma , Annika , and Mr. Snuggles ca n't come to the phone right now . But leave us a message and we 'll call you back . Bye-bye . Woof . " " Hi , " I said , envisioning the people Annika had described . " I 'm trying to reach Annika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd appreciate a call from any of the Quinns . Preferably one of the humans . " I spelled out my name and repeated my home and cell-phone numbers . " Is that our Annika ? From the show ? " Joey asked . " How 's she doing ? " " I 'm not sure , " I said . " She seems to be sort of . . . missing . " Joey turned to me . Traffic was at another dead stop as we neared Beverly Hills . Fredreeq had switched on the interior car light to rummage through her purse , and the glow made Joey 's eyes very green and her face very white against her auburn hair . She was more than beautiful ; she was intriguing , with a subtle scar running from temple to chin , white on white , a half-moon . " What do you mean , missing ? " she said . " She did n't show up for my math tutorial last night . And she did n't call her mom in Germany , which is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she does n't know a soul in America . Except me . And the host family , who 's not returning her calls . " " Interesting . " " What is ? " Traffic moved . Joey faced forward . The Mercedes inched ahead . Our eyes met in the rearview mirror . " Annika , " she said . " On the set last week , she was asking people where she could get hold of a gun . " 2 " The set " is one of those show biz terms that always makes me think of dancing girls in the forties doing the cancan on a stage at the MGM studio , or maybe a street in the Old West , the saloon and general store and jail all false fronts with nothing but fields behind . The set of Biological Clock , however , was whatever bar , bowling alley , or bistro Bing Wooster and the producers could persuade to let us film in . It was n't filming but taping , as Joey pointed out , but Bing , who had filmmaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on nine p.m . The set du jour was a restaurant called Pine on Beverly Boulevard , on a site that had seen a lot of restaurants come and go over the years . The fact that Pine was the kind that let a show like B.C. shoot there did not bode well for its longevity . " Keep it moving , folks , " Bing Wooster said to the onlookers gathered with us on the sidewalk in front of Pine . " Come on , it 's L.A. You never saw a film shoot before ? Never saw a gorgeous six-foot blonde ? Go watch her on TV . Eleven p.m. weeknights , ZPX . " I stopped scanning the crowd for teenage German girls and tried to look unconcerned , as if Bing 's speech had nothing to do with me , as if the sidewalk were full of six-foot blondes wearing too much makeup . Bing was our big kahuna . Joey had explained that most shows have producers and directors and cameramen , but Biological Clock , being low budget , had Bing . Bing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played God , six nights a week . Bing had an assistant , Paul , who did everything else : lighting , heavy lifting , crowd dispersal , and sending out for pizza . There was also Isaac , the sound guy , but he was so quiet that , despite his being the size of a grizzly bear , we tended to forget he was there . At the moment , Paul was changing tape , which was why Bing and I were stuck on the sidewalk , waiting to videotape me walking into Pine . " Bing ? " I said . " When did you last see Annika ? " Bing frowned at a figure halfway down the street , a bulked-up guy with a goatee . " Who ? Annika ? Saturday , maybe . I do n't know . Paul , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . " Paul nodded , his baseball cap bent over the Betacam , a twenty-five-pound video camera the size of a small dog , something I was trying to make friends with . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , if Joey says , let 's all pause to listen to Joey , our instant producer . . . " Animosity curdled his voice . Since Joey 's husband was the new investor in Bad Seed Productions , Bing was convinced that Joey was there to spy on and eventually wrest power from him . " What does our esteemed Mrs. Rafferty-Horowitz say ? " " That Annika talked to you about buying a gun , " I said . Bing stared at me for a moment , then glanced at the goateed guy down the street . " What am I , the NRA ? Paul , thirty seconds to reload that camera or you 're fired . " " I ca n't be fired , I 'm not paid enough . &; Continues ...
