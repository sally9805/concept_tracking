The heavy scents of bougainvillaea and manure mingle in the hot afternoon air at Shikmim Farm . Ariel Sharon pulls down the brim of his black Australian bush hat  --  a Jewish Crocodile Dundee . On his thick fingers , he is counting off the names his political enemies hurl at him : " Hard-liner . Extremist . Rightist . War criminal . " His 1,500 acres on the edge of the Negev Desert is one of the few private farms in Israel and a refuge from the controversy that has followed him through 55 years in the military and in politics . Sharon , 72 , the leader of Israel 's right-wing Likud Party , leans his portly frame against a metal pen , and two dozen startled Awassi sheep suddenly flee across the straw . Laughing , Sharon says , " Even the sheep are afraid of me . " <P> It is not only the sheep who are unnerved . In the eyes of many , it was Sharon who touched off the Holy Land 's latest crisis when he visited the Temple Mount  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinians and triggering a new intifadeh . The visit set off speculation : Did Sharon know what would happen in reaction to the visit ? Did he plan the trip as a way to begin a push for power ? Does the old cowboy feel any remorse about what happened in the violent weeks after his stroll ? If he does , he has n't been showing it . <P> What he has been showing is his famous attraction to center stage . Amid the latest violence , Israel 's opposition Shas Party gave Prime Minister Ehud Barak a one-month " umbrella " of political support , a temporary reprieve from domestic political pressure . But next week that umbrella is set to close , and Barak must figure out how to hold his government together . He has two choices : cut a deal with the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party or swallow hard and hold hands with Sharon . It will very probably be Sharon 's last bid for power  --  the final attempt of a legendary general to grab his country 's highest office . If his sheep are scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sacrifice to get what he wants . <P> It is worth stopping for a moment to look at Sharon as more than just the one-dimensional stereotype he has become : the hard-line former Defense Minister who led Israel 's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and still refuses to shake Yasser Arafat 's hand . For starters , no one calls him Ariel , Hebrew for lion . He is known universally in Israel by his nickname , Arik . And though he packs a lot of weight on his shortish frame these days , he was once a slightly bearish but , in some circles , sexy military hero . A photo of him from the 1973 October War shows him standing next to Israel 's Defense Minister Moshe Dayan , both with the satisfied grins of men doing what they were made to do . And something else : Sharon 's head is bandaged , a nice counterpoint to Dayan 's patched eye and a reminder that here were two men ready to bleed for their young country . In private , he is a fan of violin music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the end , to most Israelis , Sharon is a hard man , a man for hard times .
