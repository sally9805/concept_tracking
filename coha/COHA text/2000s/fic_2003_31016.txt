My so-called parents hate my boyfriend , Shrimp . I 'm not sure they even believe he is my boyfriend . They take one look at his five-foot-five , surfer-shirt-wearin ' , baggy-jeans-slouchin ' , Pop Tart &shy; eatin ' , spiked-hair-head self and you can just see confusion firebombs exploding in their heads , like they are thinking , Oh no , Cyd Charisse , that young man is not your homes . Dig this : He is . At least Shrimp always remembers to call my mother " Mrs. " instead of just grunting in her direction , like most guys my age do . And no parent could deny that hanging out with Shrimp is an improvement over Justin , my ex , from my old prep school . Justin got me into trouble , big time . I 'm so over the Justin stage . Not like Sid and Nancy care much . I have done my parents the favor of becoming more or less invisible . Sid , my father , calls me a " recovering hellion . " Sid 's actually my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . I met him at an airport once when I was five . He was tall and skinny and had ink black hair , like me . We ate lunch in a smoky pub at the Dallas &shy; Fort Worth airport . I did not like my hamburger so my real dad opened his briefcase and offered me a piece of homemade gingerbread he had wrapped in tinfoil . He bought me a brown rag doll at the airport gift shop . The cashier had made the doll herself . She said she had kept the doll hidden under her cash register waiting for just the right little girl . My real dad gave the cashier a one-hundred-dollar bill and told her to keep the change . I named my dolly Gingerbread . Nancy and I were on our way to San Francisco to become Sid 's family . My real dad was on his way back to New York , to his real wife and family . They do n't know about me . I 'm fairly sure that my real dad 's wife would not mind that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scabs . His real wife probably makes fresh gingerbread every day and writes Things To Do lists and does her own grocery shopping instead of having a housekeeper and a driver do everything for her , like Nancy does . Nancy only met Justin once , at the expulsion hearing . The headmaster told her Justin and I were caught fooling around in a room loaded with Jack Daniels and prescription bottles . In flagrante delicto were the words the headmaster used . I failed Latin . Nancy said Justin was from a " wonderful Connecticut family " and how could I shame her and Sid like that . It was Justin who was selling the ecstasy out of his dorm room , not me . It was Justin who said he pulled out in time . Sid and Nancy never knew about that part . Nancy came into my room one night after I returned home to San Francisco . Sid and my younger half-sibs were at Father 's Night at their French immersion school . " I hope your friends use condoms , " Nancy said , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She threw a box of Trojans onto the lace-trimmed four-poster bed that I hate . Shrimp is a safety boy , he takes care of those things . If it had been Shrimp back in boarding school , he would have come with me to the clinic . " Can I have a futon on the floor instead of this stupid princess bed ? " I said . The thought of my mother even knowing about contraception , much less doling it out , was beyond comprehension , much less discussion . Nancy sighed . Sighing is what she does instead of eating . " I paid ten thousand dollars to redecorate this room while you were at boarding school . No , you may not , Cyd Charisse . " Everybody in my family calls me by my first and middle name since my dad 's name is pronounced the same as my first name . When she was twenty years old and pregnant with me , Nancy thought she would eventually marry my real dad . She named me after this dancer-actress from like a million years ago who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first date , before she found out he had a whole other life . The real Cyd Charisse is like this incredibly beautiful sex goddess . I am okay looking . I could never be superhuman sexy like the real Cyd Charisse . I mean there is only room for so much grace and beauty in one person named Cyd Charisse , not two . Nancy fished a pack of Butter Rum LifeSavers out of her designer jacket and held them out to me . " Want a piece of my dinner ? "
