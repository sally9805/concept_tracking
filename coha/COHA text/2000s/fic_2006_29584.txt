Chapter One NORA COULD FEEL Connor watching her . He always did the same thing when she packed to leave on one of her trips . He 'd lean his six foot three frame against the doorway to his bedroom , his hands buried in the pockets of his Dockers , a frown tugging on his face . He hated the thought of their being apart . Usually he would n't say anything , though . He 'd just stand there in silence as Nora filled her suitcase , occasionally taking a sip of Evian water , her favorite . But that afternoon he could n't help himself . " Do n't go , " he said in his deep voice . Nora turned with a loving smile . " You know I have to . You know I hate this , too . " " But I already miss you . Just say no , Nora - do n't go . To hell with them . " From day one , Nora was captivated by how vulnerable Connor allowed himself to be with her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rich and hard-driving hedge-fund manager with his own successful company in Greenwich , with another office in London . His puppy-dog eyes belied the fact that he was built like a lion . Powerful and proud . Indeed , at the relatively young age of forty , Connor was pretty much king of all he surveyed . And in Nora , thirtythree , he 'd found his queen , his perfect soul mate in life . " You know I could tie you up and keep you fromleaving , " he said jokingly . " That sounds like fun , " said Nora , playing along . She lifted up the top of her suitcase , which was lying open on the bed . She was searching for something . " First , though , could you maybe help me find my green cardigan ? " Connor finally chuckled . He got such a kick out of her . Good jokes , bad jokes - it did n't seem to matter . " Do you mean the one with the pearl buttons ? It 's in the master closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes again , were n't you ? " She headed for the cavernous walk-in closet . When she returned , green sweater in hand , Connor had moved to the foot of the bed . He stared at her with a grin and a twinkle in his eye . " Uh-oh , " she said . " I know that look . " " What look ? " he asked . " The one that says you want a going-away present . " Nora thought for a moment before flashing a grin of her own . She dropped the sweater on a chair and slowly walked up to Connor , purposefully stopping just inches from his body . She was wearing only her bra and panties . " From me , to you , " she whispered in his ear , leaning in . There was n't that much to unwrap , but Connor took his time anyway . He gently kissed Nora 's neck , then her shoulders , his lips tracing an imaginary line downward to the jutting curves of her small , pert breasts . There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching around to remove her bra . Nora shivered , her body tingling . Cute , funny , and very good in bed . What more could a girl ask for ? Connor knelt and kissed Nora 's stomach , his tongue lightly drawing circles around her little wink of a belly button . Then , with a thumb resting on either side of her hips , he began to roll down her panties . He charted the progress with kiss after kiss after kiss . " That 's ... very ... nice , " whispered Nora . Now it was her turn . As Connor 's tall , muscular frame straightened out before her , she began to undress him . Quickly , deftly , but sensually . For a few seconds they stood still . Perfectly naked . Gazing at each other , taking in each and every detail . God , what could be better than this ? Suddenly Nora laughed . She gave Connor a quick , playful shove , and he fell back onto the bed . He was fully aroused . A prodigious human sundial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
