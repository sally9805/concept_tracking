Warren , Michigan , 2000 Jaine Bright woke up in a bad mood . Her neighbor , the blight of the neighborhood , had just roared home at three A.M. If his car had a muffler , it had long since ceased functioning . Unfortunately , her bedroom was on the same side of the house as his driveway ; not even pulling the pillow over her head could block out the sound of that eight-cylinder Pontiac . He slammed the car door , turned on his kitchen porch light which by some evil design was positioned to shine directly into her eyes if she was lying facing the window , which she was let his screen door slam three times as he went in , came back out a few minutes later , then went back in , and evidently forgot about the porch light , because a few minutes later the light in the kitchen blinked out but that damn porch light stayed on . If she had known about her neighbor before she bought this house , she never , never would have closed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , he had single-handedly managed to destroy all the joy she 'd felt on buying her first house . He was a drunk . Why could n't he be a happy drunk ? she wondered sourly . No , he had to be a surly , nasty drunk , the kind who made her afraid to let the cat go outside when he was home . BooBoo was n't much of a cat he was n't even hers but her mom loved him , so Jaine did n't want anything to happen to him while she had temporary custody . She would never be able to face her mom again if her parents returned from their dream vacation , touring Europe for six weeks , to find BooBoo dead or missing . Her neighbor already had it in for poor BooBoo anyway , because he 'd found paw prints on the windshield and hood of his car . From the way he had reacted , you 'd have thought he drove a new Rolls rather than a ten-year-old Pontiac with a bumper crop of dings down both sides . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time he did ; at least , she 'd assumed at the time he 'd been going to work . Now she thought he 'd probably been going to buy more booze . If he worked at all , then he had really weird hours , because so far she had n't been able to discern a pattern in his arrivals and departures . Anyway , she had tried to be nice on the day he spotted the paw prints ; she 'd even smiled at him , which , considering how he had snapped at her because her housewarming party had woken him up at two in the afternoon ! had been a real effort for her . But he had n't paid any attention to the peace-offering smile , instead erupting out of his car almost as soon as his butt hit the seat . " How about keeping your damn cat off my car , lady ! " The smile froze on her face . Jaine hated wasting a smile , especially on an unshaven , bloodshot-eyed , foul-tempered jerk . Several blistering comments sprang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was new to the neighborhood , and she had already gotten off on the wrong foot with this guy . The last thing she wanted was a war between them . She decided to give diplomacy one more shot , though it obviously had n't worked during the housewarming party . " I 'm sorry , " she said , keeping her voice even . " I 'll try to keep an eye on him . I 'm baby-sitting him for my parents , so he wo n't be here much longer . " Just five more weeks . He had snarled some indistinct reply and slammed back into his car , then roared off , the powerful engine rumbling like thunder . Jaine cocked her head , listening . The Pontiac 's body looked like hell , but that motor ran smooth as silk . There were a lot of horses under that hood . Diplomacy evidently did n't work on this guy . Now , here he was , waking up the entire neighborhood at three A.M. with that blasted car . The injustice of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the afternoon , made her want to march over to his house and hold her finger against his doorbell until he was up and as wide awake as everyone else . There was just one little problem . She was the teeniest bit afraid of him . She did n't like it ; Jaine was n't accustomed to backing down from anyone , but this guy made her uneasy . She did n't even know his name , because the two times they 'd met had n't been the " hello , my name is so-and-so " type of encounters . All she knew was that he was a rough-looking character , and he did n't seem to hold down a regular job . At best , he was a drunk , and drunks could be mean and destructive . At worst , he was involved in illegal stuff , which added dangerous to the list . He was a big , muscular guy , with dark hair cut so short he almost looked like a skinhead . Every time she had seen him , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Add that to the bloodshot eyes and bad temper , and she came up with drunk . The fact that he was big and muscular only added to her uneasiness . This had seemed like such a safe neighborhood , but she did n't feel safe with him as her next-door neighbor . Grumbling to herself , she got out of bed and pulled down the window shade . She had learned over the years not to cover her windows , because an alarm clock might not wake her up , but sunlight always did . Dawn was better than any clanging noise at getting her out of bed . Since she had , several times , found her clock knocked onto the floor , she assumed it had roused her enough to attack it , but not enough to completely wake her . Her system now was sheer curtains over a shade ; the sheers kept anyone from seeing inside unless a light was on , and she raised the shade only after she 'd turned out the light for the night . If she was late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for forcing her to rely on the clock instead of the sun . She stumbled over BooBoo on the way back to bed . The cat jumped up with a startled yowl , and Jaine damn near had a heart attack . " Jesus ! BooBoo , you scared the hell out of me . " She was n't used to having a pet in the house , and she was always forgetting to watch where she stepped . Why on earth her mother had wanted her to baby-sit the cat , instead of Shelley or Dave , was beyond her . They both had kids who could play with BooBoo and keep him entertained . Since school was out for summer vacation , that meant someone was home at both their houses almost all day , every day . But , nooo . Jaine had to keep BooBoo . Never mind that she was single , was at work five days a week , and was n't used to having a pet . If she did have a pet , it would n't be one like BooBoo , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been neutered , and he took out his frustration on the furniture . In just one week , he had frayed the sofa to the point that she would have to have it reupholstered . And BooBoo did n't like her . He liked her well enough when he was in his home , coming around to be petted , but he did n't like being in her home at all . Every time she tried to pet him now , he arched his back and hissed at her . To top it off , Shelley was mad at her because Mom had chosen Jaine to baby-sit her precious BooBoo . After all , Shelley was the oldest , and obviously more settled . It did n't make sense that Jaine had been chosen over her . Jaine agreed with her , but that did n't soothe the hurt feelings . No , what really topped it off was that David , who was a year younger than Shelley , was mad at her too . Not because of BooBoo ; David was allergic to cats . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious car in her garage which meant she could n't park in her own garage , since it was a single , and it was damned inconvenient . She wished David had the blasted car . She wished Dad had left it in his own garage , but he 'd been afraid to leave it unattended for six weeks . She understood that , but she did n't understand why she 'd been chosen to baby-sit both cat and car . Shelley did n't understand the cat , David did n't understand the car , and Jaine did n't understand any of it . So both her brother and sister were mad at her , BooBoo was systematically destroying her sofa , she was terrified something would happen to Dad 's car while it was in her care , and her sot of a neighbor was making her life miserable . God , why had she ever bought a house ? If she had stayed in her apartment , none of this would be happening , because she had n't had a garage and pets had n't been allowed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its older , nineteen-forties-vintage houses and corresponding low prices . She had seen a good mix of people , from younger families with children to retired people whose families visited every Sunday . Some of the older folks actually sat on their porches during the cool of the evening , waving to passersby , and children played in their yards without worrying about drive-by shootings . She should have checked out all her neighbors , but at first blush this had seemed like a nice , safe area for a single woman to live , and she had been thrilled at finding a good , solid house at such a low price . Because thinking about her neighbor was guaranteed to prevent her from going back to sleep , Jaine linked her hands behind her head and stared up at the dark ceiling as she thought about all the things she wanted to do with the house . The kitchen and bath both needed modernizing , which were big-ticket improvements and something she was n't financially ready to tackle . But new paint and new shutters would go a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the wall between the living and dining rooms , open it up so the dining room was more of an alcove than a separate room , with an arch that she could paint in one of those faux-stone paints so it looked like rock ... She woke to the annoying beep of the alarm clock . At least the damn thing had woken her up this time , she thought as she rolled over to silence the alarm . The red numbers shining at her in the dim room made her blink , and look again . " Ah , hell , " she groaned in disgust as she leaped out of bed . Six-fifty-eight ; the alarm had been going off for almost an hour , which meant she was late . Way late . " Damn it , damn it , damn it , " she muttered as she jumped into the shower and , a minute later , jumped out again . As she brushed her teeth , she dashed into the kitchen and opened a can of food for BooBoo , who was already sitting beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink and turned on the water to wash the toothpaste down the drain . " Of all days , why could n't you have jumped on the bed when you got hungry ? No , today you decided to wait , and now I do n't have time to eat . " BooBoo indicated that he did n't care whether she ate or not , so long as he had food . She dashed back into the bathroom , did a hurried makeup job , slipped earrings into her earlobes and her watch onto her wrist , then grabbed the outfit she always grabbed when she was in a hurry because she did n't have to fuss with it : black trousers and a white silk shell , with a snazzy red jacket topping it off . She jammed her feet into her shoes , grabbed her purse , and was out the door . The first thing she saw was the little gray-haired lady who lived across the street , putting out her trash . It was trash-collection day . " Hell , damn , shit , piss , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath as she wheeled and rushed back into the house . " I 'm trying to cut back on my swearing , " she snapped at BooBoo as she pulled the trash bag out of the can and tied off the tapes , " but you and Mr. Congeniality are making it tough . " BooBoo turned his back on her . She dashed out of the house again , remembered she had n't locked the door , and dashed back , then dragged her big metal garbage can down to the curb and deposited the morning 's offerings inside it , on top of the other two bags already in it . For once , she did n't try to be quiet ; she hoped she woke up the inconsiderate jerk in the house next door . She ran back to her car , a cherry red Dodge Viper that she loved , and just for good measure , when she started the engine , she revved it up a few times before putting it in reverse . The car shot backward and with an almighty clang collided with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled into her next-door neighbor 's can and knocked it over , sending the lid rolling down the street . Jaine closed her eyes and tapped her head on the steering wheel gently ; she did n't want a concussion . Though maybe she should give herself a concussion ; at least then she would n't have to worry about getting to work on time , which was now a physical impossibility . She did n't swear , though ; the only words that came to mind were words she really did n't want to use . She put the car in park and got out . What was needed now was control , not a temper tantrum . She righted her dented can and placed the spilled bags back inside it , then jammed the warped lid back on top . Next she returned her neighbor 's can to its full and upright position , gathered the trash he was n't nearly as neat with his trash collection as she was , but what did you expect from a drunk then walked down the street to collect the lid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next house down . As she bent to pick it up , she heard a screen door slam behind her . Well , she had gotten her wish : the inconsiderate jerk was awake . " What in hell are you doing ? " he barked . He looked scary , in his sweatpants and torn , dirty T-shirt , a black scowl on his unshaven face . She turned and marched back to the worse-for-wear pair of cans and slammed the lid down on top of his can . " Picking up your garbage , " she snapped . His eyes were shooting fire . Actually they were just bloodshot , as usual , but the effect was the same . " Just what is it you have against letting me get some sleep ? You 're the noisiest damn woman I 've ever seen " The injustice of that made her forget she was a little afraid of him . Jaine stalked up to him , glad she was wearing shoes with two-inch heels that lifted her up so she was level with his ... chin . Almost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mad beat big any day of the week . " I 'm noisy ? " she said through gritted teeth . It was tough to get much volume when her jaw was locked , but she tried . " I 'm noisy ? " She jabbed her finger at him . She did n't want to actually touch him , because his T-shirt was torn and stained with ... something . " I 'm not the one who woke the whole neighborhood at three o'clock this morning with that piece of junk you call a car . Buy a muffler , for God 's sake ! I 'm not the one who slammed his car door once , the screen door three times what , did you forget your bottle and have to go back for it ? and left his porch light on so it shone into my bedroom and kept me from sleeping . " He opened his mouth to blast her in return , but Jaine was n't finished . " Furthermore , it 's a hell of a lot more reasonable to expect people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at two in the afternoon , or " she checked her watch " seven-twenty-three in the morning . " God , she was so late . " So back off , buddy ! Go crawl back into your bottle . If you drink enough , you 'll sleep through anything . " He opened his mouth again . Jaine forgot herself and actually poked him . Oh , yuk . Now she 'd have to boil her finger . " I 'll buy you a new can tomorrow , so just shut up . And if you do anything to hurt my mom 's cat , I 'll take you apart cell by cell . I 'll mutilate your DNA so it can never reproduce , which would probably be a good thing for the world . " She swept him with a blistering look that took in his ragged , dirty clothes and unshaven jaw . " Do you understand me ? " He nodded . She took a deep breath , reaching for the rein on her temper . " Okay . All right , then . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying not to do that . " He gave her a strange look . " Yeah , you really need to watch that damn cussing . " She pushed her hair out of her face and tried to remember if she had brushed it this morning . " I 'm late , " she said . " I have n't had any sleep , any breakfast , or any coffee . I 'd better leave before I hurt you . " He nodded . " That 's a good idea . I 'd hate to have to arrest you . " She stared at him , taken aback . " What ? " " I 'm a cop , " he said , then turned and walked back into his house . Jaine stared after him , shocked . A cop ? " Well , fuck , " she said .
