This morning I passed a woman on a road bike , properly kitted up but with a floral-print skirt over her bike shorts . It was perhaps the boldest style move I 've seen , and I immediately thought to seek your counsel. - Paul Musso , CA Let me seek your counsel , Paul . If I encounter a fit , stylish woman with whom I share a common interest , should I a ) talk to her or b ) drop her and speed home to write letters to magazines ? While you 've been busy riding solo and reading Dear Abby , the wraparound floral-print skort debuted early this millennium and became the base piece for female bike commuters across the country . Back then , a gentleman would 've slowed , commented briefly on the lady 's panache , then moved along , putting great trust in fate . Given current context , you did the right thing . You do n't want to be scaring too many people off bikes . How do you attack a hill with such style that despite getting dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with them five minutes after the downhill ? - Eliel T. Lim , Philippines You got three choices here . The first is a combo deceit , which comes from such depths of desperate longing for acceptance that it transfigures two pitiful actions into something approaching beauty : You fake the **31;4173;TOOLONG routine by attacking like a death-row inmate getting a conjugal visit . Grind away until , just as the pack passes , at the moment of your denouement , you give a wise , world-weary shake of your head and smile as if directing your escaping life force inward . Then , when you rejoin the group , proffer a handful of wild raspberries you claim to have harvested at the crest , but which you secreted in your jersey pocket before the ride . Second , from the base , set tempo for the best climber , peeling off the unworthies with your mighty pace until , four pedal strokes before you blow , you swing elegantly off the front , and make a slight but graceful gesture , such as unzipping your jersey 3-5.5 centimeters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but do not make eye contact or take a drink ; you 're finished with business , not fatigued . Third , Eliel , you could get your narcissistic , misanthropic , overthinking butt on the bike and learn to climb so you do n't get dropped . Authenticity-that 's style . Helmet straps : under or over glasses ? - Steve Hertel , MD Why are we even talking about this ? It 's kindergarten : Straps under , whether you 're talking bib shorts and jerseys or helmets and shades . Show up with either strap in a twist , and you might as well put chainring grease on your calf . But as this is the level of our discourse , you 'll have to camouflage ignorance with flash : An unattainable-in-the-U.S . Selev Atom Millenio helmet and $310 Prada shades . The Starbucks barista was n't laughing with you . Get help at StyleMan@BICYCLING.com . <p>
