Kate was standing at the island counter , eyes swollen from crying , makeup smeared across one of her cheeks , staring at the food : platters of cold cuts and bowls of potato salad , plates of cookies , assorted cheeses and fresh fruit . Owen 's obituary , half a page in the Detroit Free Press , was folded open next to the sink . A line under his photograph said , " Owen McCall , age 49 , October 11 , 2006 . " Everybody had paid their respects and taken off , and now she felt exhausted , drained . She poured a glass of chardonnay and lit a cigarette . She was numb , her mind a blur , still trying to come to grips with what had happened . Luke entered the kitchen , walked past her , detached , expressionless , the same zombie trance he 'd been in since the accident . He opened the refrigerator and grabbed a Gatorade , purple liquid in a plastic bottle called Riptide Rush . Kate said , " Come here . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know you 're hurting . I am , too . " She could feel Luke , rigid in her embrace . " I 'm sorry , " he said . She could see tears in his eyes before he looked down , staring at the floor . " You ca n't blame yourself . It was an accident . " Luke pushed away from her . " I do n't want to talk about it . " He moved across the kitchen into the breakfast room and disappeared . It was dark when she went upstairs , leaning against the banister , right hand on the smooth polished oak as she scaled the winding staircase . A light in the foyer was on , but she was too tired to go down and turn it off . At the top of the stairs , she went left to Luke 's room . The door was closed , she knocked and opened it and saw him on his bed staring up at the ceiling . She said good night . He did n't move , did n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Luke . He got up , shook his tail and yelped . Luke said , " Chill , Leon . " The dog sat down . Kate closed the door and went to her room , walked through into the bathroom and stared at herself in the mirror hanging over the sink . She looked tired . She pulled her hair back behind her ears and turned the faucet on . Cupped water in her hands and washed her face . She glanced over , saw Owen 's blue terry cloth robe hanging on the back of the door , went over and lifted it off the hook and hugged it . Now she sat on the side of the tub and wept , letting go . Kate walked into the bedroom , pulled the spread down and stretched out on the king-size bed  --  Owen 's side  --  and smelled his pillow , with its hint of Old Spice . There were family photographs on the night table in gold and silver frames . She picked up a sepia-tone picture of Owen with short hair , age seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile on his little face , proud because he 'd just made his First Communion . She put it back and picked up another , this one shot on their wedding day , Kate thinking it was one of the few pictures in sixteen years that showed Owen with his eyes open . She held it and remembered the day they met . Ran into him coming around a corner at Farmer Jack 's , the store at Lahser and Maple . Their carts hitting head-on with impact and it was so unexpected , it was funny . He said , " You okay ? " " I think so , " Kate said , " except for the whiplash . " He held her in his gaze , maybe wondering if she was serious . " I 'm Owen , " he said . " And you ? " " Kate , " she said , offering her hand . He took it in his , looked her in the eye and said , " Kate , you doing anything tonight ? " " What do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make up for your injury . " " Is this how you get dates ? " Kate said . " Run into someone with your grocery cart ? " He grinned . He had a grocery list in his hand , a five-by-seven-inch lined yellow sheet and his cart was filled with cans of soup and tuna fish . He obviously was n't much of a cook . Kate said , " I do n't even know you . " Owen said , " We just met , did n't we ? " Kate said , " You could be a rapist . " " I could even be a Republican . " He grinned . " That was going to be my next question . " They went to a little place called Oliverio 's that night  --  a dark , loud Italian restaurant with white tablecloths and waiters in black suits  --  had veal chops with cognac cream sauce , drank Brunello and told their life stories to each other . Owen was a stock car driver . " I knew I wanted to race from the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd go with my dad to his Chevy dealership in Dearborn and help the mechanics . All I wanted to do was work on cars . And when I turned sixteen , all I wanted to do was race them . My dad , on the other hand , wanted me at the store . His plan was to teach me the business , sell me the dealership and retire . " Owen looked down at his plate and cut into his veal chop and took a bite . " This is good is n't it ? I started racing for real right after high school . Teamed up with a friend , big easygoing guy named Charley Degener . He was a few years older and had been an over-the-wall tire changer for a single car team , but his real specialty was horsepower . " He picked up his wineglass and took a gulp , drank it like a soft drink . " In the early days it was just me and Charley . He built the motors . I did the cars . We started on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Winston Cup . We were n't going to settle for anything less . We pulled the racecar behind a converted bread truck . You looked close , you could see the faint outline of Wonder Bread on the side . It was loaded with tools , parts and tires . Charley and I even slept in it on occasion . The deal was , we had to make enough on the track to come back the next week . " Kate said , " Did you win ? " " You want to know about my checkered past , huh ? " He grinned big . He was corny but appealing , had a nice easy way about him  --  big hands and shoulders and a good face , handsome in a rugged way . " First year we made ten races , including one pole , three top fives , and five top tens . But to answer your question , no checkered flags . " " How about since then ? " " We 've done okay . " He was the master of understatement , Kate discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted or lost his cool , played everything low-key . " When you see it on TV , it looks like they 're really moving , " Kate said . " How fast do you go ? " " Two hundred and change , flat-footing it down the straights . " " I went a hundred and ten one time in my father 's Audi and it felt like warp speed . " " Once you get used to it , it 's like driving on the freeway  --  you almost feel like you 're in slow motion  --  only there are twenty-five cars trying to blow your doors off . " Kate cut a piece of veal , dipped it in the sauce , and took a bite . " You look as far ahead as you can and rely on peripheral vision , " Owen said . He took a big gulp of wine . " And always be aware of where everyone is . That 's basically it . After awhile , you do it without thinking . " " If it 's that easy , " Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm looking for a new career . " " My dad took pity on us , I guess , and donated fifteen grand a year in sponsorship money . The rub was , I had to spend time at the dealership , learn the business . That was the tradeoff . " " It looks dangerous , " Kate said . " My dad took me to a NASCAR race at Michigan International Speedway and there were three crashes . " " I had her buried down one of the straights at Martinsville , passed a slower car on the right , nicked the wall , spun off and flipped three times . It felt like it happened in slo-mo . I remember being airborne , seeing sky . I came down , blew out all the glass . Amazing thing was , the car was totaled  --  every panel damaged  --  and I walked away without a scratch . Watched a forklift pick the car up and put it on a flatbed and decided right then to break up with this girl I was living with . All of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were talking about getting married . " The waiter came and cleared their plates and came back , and they ordered espresso and Sambuca . Kate said , " Do you like tiramisu ? We could split one . " " Sounds good , " Owen said . " But I want to hear about you . " Kate told him how she 'd grown up in Birmingham , an only child in a neighborhood full of big Irish families . The Youngs had seven , the Ivorys , eight , the O'Clairs , ten and the Callaghans , eighteen . " Eighteen , " Owen said . " Must 've been something in the water . " " Rhythm method gone wild , " Kate said . " I went to Marian , an all-girls Catholic high school and played tennis , number one singles . I was ranked second in the state , eighteen and under , and I got a scholarship to Michigan , a full ride . " " You look like a tennis player , " Owen said . " How tall are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's perfect . " Dessert was served . Owen picked up his Sambuca and Kate picked up hers and they clinked glasses . He said , " Salut . " Kate sipped the warm licorice liqueur , put her glass down and took a bite of tiramisu . " You have to try this . " Owen reached his spoon over , scooped some up , and put it in his mouth . He nodded and said , " That is something , is n't it ? " Kate said , " I played two years and only lost four matches . I was All  --  Big Ten and honorable mention , All-American , and then I blew out my right knee , my ACL . It was the beginning of my junior year and that was it for collegiate tennis . " Owen opened a bag of sugar and poured some into his espresso and stirred it with a spoon . Kate said , " I partied after that  --  drinking and smoking  --  something I 'd never done much of before , and at the end of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sixteen credits shy of graduating , I joined the Peace Corps . " Owen stirred his coffee and took a sip and placed it back on the saucer . " You were so close . Why did n't you finish ? " " My knee healed , but I knew I 'd never be able to play the way I had . I was bored , tired of going to parties and sitting around smoking weed . I wanted to travel , do something interesting . I knew a girl who 'd joined the Peace Corps , lived in India for two years . She said it was the most incredible experience of her life , trekking through Nepal and going to base camp on Mount Everest , eighteen thousand feet above sea level . I looked around and thought , what did I have to lose ? " Owen said , " When I hear Peace Corps , I think of a bunch of happy , clean-cut kids sitting around in a circle , singing folk songs . Is that what it was like ? " Kate took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and flying to Miami and then to Guatemala City , the largest town in Central America  --  a million and a half people  --  and taking a two-hour ride on a chicken bus to San Pedro . " Owen said , " Where in the hell 's that ? " " Eastern Guatemala , " Kate said . " What do they speak ? " " Cakchiquel , " Kate said , " a local Mayan dialect , and also Spanish . The point I 'm trying to make , I arrived in this little town and did n't know a soul and I had to find a place to live . " " Peace Corps did n't help you ? " " No , " Kate said . " And people stared at me everywhere I went . Women would come up to me and run their fingers through my hair because they 'd never seen a blond before . " " Or blue eyes , I 'll bet , " Owen said . " Why 'd you pick eastern Guatemala ? " That 's where they needed help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had fifty little Mayan girls who called me Seo Kate , short for Seorita . I 'd walk in the classroom and they 'd surround me , hang on my arms and waist and not let go , giggling . I 'd have to pry them off . " " You liked it though , I can tell . " " I loved it , " Kate said . " The kids wanted to learn . I 'd tell them stories and we 'd sing songs and play games . It was fun . " " Wish I 'd had a teacher like you , " Owen said . He reached over the table and touched her hand . " You 're better-looking than Sister Mary Andrews who I had in second grade . Nicer , too . " Owen sipped his Sambuca . Kate said , " Do you eat the coffee beans ? " " I do n't , " Owen said , " but you can . " " When I got to San Pedro , I went around to the shops , asking if they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of options in this town at the end of the bus route . It was n't a tourist destination . People did n't go there for its deluxe accommodations or four-star dining . " She could see he was interested , sipping the liqueur , giving her his full attention . " I spent the first night in the school where I 'd be teaching , slept on a bench in the principal 's office , and the next day , I found a little house with a patio in back . " " How much was the rent ? " " A hundred eighty quetzales a month , " Kate said . " Twentyeight bucks for a four-room house with running water . Not bad , eh ? " " What did they pay you ? " Owen said . " Nothing , " Kate said . " It 's volunteer . I got $150 a month for expenses . And they give you six thousand when you leave , when your tour is over . " " Were you afraid , living alone in a strange country ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were steel and the patio was surrounded by a cinder-block wall that was seven feet high , topped with chicken wire . " " Sounds like you were a prisoner . " " Most of the houses in the village were like that , " Kate said . She took a bite of tiramisu , savoring it . " It was my first house and I loved it . I painted the walls bright colors and bought furniture and plants at the market . I 'd never lived alone before . It was exciting , but also weird because it 's a male-dominated , third-world culture where women have to ask permission to leave the house . You think they thought I was a little odd ? " She told him about having water only two or three hours every other day and getting up at five-thirty in the morning to fill plastic buckets . And about the water , during the rainy season , coming out like mud . She 'd have to boil and strain it to get anything . She told him about learning how to kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking it Mayan style . She told him about her neighbor , a little old lady who sold moonshine from her kitchen , and about the drunks who would fall asleep on the grass in front of her house , Kate finally getting the nerve to tell them to find somewhere else to sleep , and they never bothered her again . And she told him about her Guatemalan girlfriends , Marina and Luzia , bathing in the temescale , a sauna made of adobe and mud , behind her house and talking like girls everywhere , about boys , who they liked and their plans for the future . " One time , Luzia asked me if I thought Guatemalan boys were handsome and would I ever have a Guatemalan boyfriend ? I said no , but it had nothing to do with their looks , it was because our cultures were so different . I said I could never go out with someone I had to ask permission to leave the house . " Marina said , but if you really loved him , and he wanted you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our culture , if my boyfriend or husband loved me , he would trust me . I said I did n't need a man to take care of me . I told them I had a boyfriend named Jack back in Michigan and I could n't imagine asking him for permission to do anything . He 'd think I was crazy . " Luzia said she liked asking permission . Marina did too . They both said they 'd feel strange not asking . While we talked , we were eating roasted cow udder . " Owen said , " Hang on a minute  --  roasted cow udder ? What 'd it taste like ? " " Chicken . " She liked the way he grinned and liked it when he reached over and touched her hand . And then she told him about Marina , who , in a town full of thick-bodied Mayan women , had the trim shapely figure of a Ladino . " She was the most beautiful girl in town . " Owen grinned at her and said , " She 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You want to hear this ? " Owen said , " I 'm sorry , I 'll stop giving you compliments . " " Marina was married , " Kate said , " but her husband Benigno had been in New Jersey for a year cutting grass and shoveling snow , trying to save enough money to build their own house and start a family . Marina lived with her mother , a muchacha , a maid , in a small house with a tin roof that leaked . " She came over early one morning carrying an old beat-up suitcase and said she had to leave San Pedro right away . She was crying and very upset . I asked her what happened and she would n't tell me at first and then started speaking in rapid-fire Cakchiquel and then slower in Spanish , saying that Captain Emiliano Garza , head of the National Police and a respected member of the community , had forced himself on her . She was going to New Jersey to be with Benigno . I said , ' How are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mojado . ' " Owen said , " What 's that ? " " It means wet , the literal translation , but it really meant illegally . How else was she going to get there without a passport and visa ? " I said to her , ' Who is going to take care of Ysabel ? ' Her mother . She said she did n't know , but had to leave right away because Captain Garza was coming back that night . Of all the girls in town he had chosen Marina and she should feel honored . " I was there at her house when the captain came calling . He was a short compact man , a Ladino in a crisp blue uniform and well-shined black boots that brought him up to about five six , a little bull with a neatly trimmed black mustache and dark serious eyes . I could see him studying me from across the room , taking his time , a man used to being in control . I was thinking he looked like a doorman at a nice hotel . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gold buttons . " He was n't expecting anyone else to be there with Marina and I could see he was n't sure what to do . He asked Marina who I was and she said , ' A friend . ' " I said to him , ' If you touch her again I 'm going to contact the American consulate and take whatever measures are necessary to have you prosecuted . That 's who I am . ' " He smiled at Marina in a shy formal way and said , ' Do you agree with this ? ' " Marina looked down at the floor and said , ' Yes . ' Captain Garza said he understood . That was it . He walked out and got in his Jeep and drove away . Marina cried and we hugged . " " That took nerve , " Owen said , " standing up to a cop in a foreign country . Was that the end of it ? " " Not exactly , " Kate said . " I 'll tell you another time . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first date . Kate looked around . They were the only two people in the restaurant . She had n't noticed before . Owen paid the bill and drove her home . He walked her up to the front door and kissed her on the cheek and said , " Can I call you ? " Kate said , " You better .
