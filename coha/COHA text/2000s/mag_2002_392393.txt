A lack of sexual desire is no stranger among us . It is the most common sexual condition in America  --  some 25 percent of us suffer from it . Gerald Weeks , Ph.D. , and Jeffery Winters offers methods for overcoming this vexing problem . Photograph // KELLY SEEMED TO HAVE IT ALL . A LOVING MOTHER of three and a public-relations executive in Manhattan , she had a handsome and charming partner who was a successful entrepreneur . They jetted off for vacations in the Caribbean and dined in the finest restaurants . But their relationship floundered in one intractable area . " After a while , " Kelly says , " he just stopped wanting to have sex . He 'd go months without even touching me . " It 's a subject that 's full of shame : low sex drive . When your partner has no interest in sex despite your best efforts , it 's easy to become perplexed . And without guidance , partners may characterize the problem in ways that can destroy the relationship . Photograph // In a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have no desire for sex . But it is a startlingly common problem . Millions of people suffer from a condition known as hypoactive sexual desire ( HSD ) about 25 percent of all Americans , by one estimate , or a third of women and a fifth of men . Sex researchers and therapists now recognize it as the most common sexual problem . In recent years , experts have turned their attention to the causes of HSD , and sex therapists are working on strategies to treat it . Although there is a 50 percent positive outcome in treatment , many of those who have HSD do n't seek help . This is usually because they do n't realize it 's a problem , other issues in the relationship seem more important or they feel ashamed . Many couples in conflict may have an underlying problem with sexual desire . When desire fades in one partner , other things start to fall apart . How little is too little ? For Pam , happily married and in her forties , her once healthy sexual desire simply disappeared about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened to my sexual appetite , " she says , " but it is like someone turned it off at the switch . " She and her husband still have sex , maybe once every few weeks , but she does it out of obligation , not enthusiasm . " I used to enjoy sex , " Pam says . " Now there 's a vital part of me that 's missing . " Ordinary people are n't in a constant state of sexual desire . Everyday occurrences-fatigue , job stress , even the common cold-can drive away urges for lovemaking . Usually , however , spending romantic time with a partner , having sexual thoughts or seeing stimulating images can lead to arousal and the return of a healthy sex drive . Yet for some people , desire never returns-or was never there to begin with . Frequently , even healthy sexual fantasies are virtually nonexistent in some people who suffer from HSD . Just how little sex is too little ? Sometimes , when a partner complains of not having enough sex , his problem may actually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no daily minimum requirement of sexual activity . In a recent British survey , published in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy , 24 percent of couples reported having no sex in the previous three months . And the classic study , Sex in America , found that one-third of couples had sex just a few times a year . Although the studies report frequency of sex , not desire , it 's likely that one partner in these couples has HSD . One tiny pill Four years ago , another sexual problem-erectile dysfunction-received a sudden burst of attention when a medical " cure " hit the shelves . Before Viagra came along , men with physically based problems suffered impotence in silence , and without much hope . Now many couples enjoy a renewed reservoir of passion . Obviously , any pill that relieves hypoactive sexual desire would be wildly popular . Unfortunately , the causes of HSD seem to be complex and varied ; some sufferers might be treated with a simple pill , but most will likely need therapy-not chemistry . One common source of reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reuptake inhibitors . SSRIs have been found to all but eliminate desire in some patients . Antidepressants such as Prozac and Zoloft are among the most widely prescribed drugs for treating depression . Yet one distressing side effect is a drop in sex drive . Some studies indicate that as many as 50 percent of people on SSRIs suffer from a markedly reduced sex drive . Researchers believe that SSRIs quash the libido by flooding the bloodstream with serotonin , a chemical that signals satiety . " The more you bathe people in serotonin , the less they need to be sexual , " says Joseph Marzucco , MSPAC , a sex therapist practicing in Portland , Oregon . " SSRIs can just devastate sexual desire . " Fortunately , researchers are studying antidepressants that act through other channels . Bupropion hydrochloride , which enhances the brain 's production of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine , has received extra attention as a substitute for SSRIs . Early studies suggest that it may actually increase sexual desire in test subjects . A study reported last year in the Journal of Sex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bupropion reported more desire , arousal and fantasy . It 's all In your head Physiological problems can also lead to a loss of sexual desire . Men with abnormal pituitary glands can overproduce the hormone prolactin , which usually turns off the sex drive . As reported in a recent issue of the International Journal of Impotence Research , tests of a drug that blocks prolactin found it increased the libido in healthy males . In women , some experts believe that one cause of weak sexual desire is , ironically , low testosterone levels . Normally associated with brawny , deep-voiced men , testosterone is a hormone with a definite masculine identity . But women also make small amounts of it in their ovaries , and it plays an important role in their sexual lives . Without a healthy level of testosterone in the blood , some researchers believe , women are unable to properly respond to sexual stimuli . Furthermore , there is anecdotal evidence that testosterone supplements can restore the sex drive in women . Rosemary Basson , M.D. , of the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little is known about the role testosterone plays in women . " We do n't even know how much testosterone is normal , " Basson says . " The tests designed for men ca n't pick up the levels found in women . " In one study suggesting that HSD is more psychological than physiological , Basson and her colleagues tested the effects of Viagra on women who reported arousal problems . Basson found that while the drug generally produced the physical signals of sexual arousal , many women reported that they still did n't feel turned on . Indeed , many psychologists and sex therapists believe that most patients with HSD have sound bodies and troubled relationships . The clinical experience of Weeks has shown that two factors identified in a relationship can , over time , devastate the sex drive : chronically suppressed anger toward the partner and a lack-or loss-of control over the relationship . And once these issues threaten a healthy sex drive , lack of intimacy can aggravate the problems further . Without help , these issues can balloon until the relationship itself is seriously damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacking the desire for desire Although HSD is one of the most difficult to address of all sexual problems , it can be treated successfully . The key is to find a highly qualified sex and marital therapist who has experience in dealing with it . Unfortunately , while HSD is the most common problem that sex therapists see , millions of cases go untreated . Some people who lack desire are just too embarrassed to seek help , especially men . Others are so focused on immediate concerns  --  such as a stressful job or a family crisis-that they put off dealing with the loss of a healthy libido . Still others have become so used to having no sex drive that they no longer miss it ; they lack the desire for desire . These people represent the most severe cases-the hardest to treat . Some people who do n't get treatment find ways to adjust . " Thank goodness my husband is so patient and caring , " Pam says . " He tries to spark interest , but when it is not ignited he 'll settle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strain . After a year , Kelly and her boyfriend broke up . " I could n't convince him that it was a problem , " she says , " but it was . " Sidebar FOR MEN ONLY Sidebar It 's a paradox : Men are generally characterized as being ready , willing and able for sex at just about any moment of the day or night . But recent surveys show that up to 20 percent of men report little or no sexual desire . And the stereotype of the horny male makes it difficult for men with HSD to get to a healthy level of desire . Instead of getting stuck in a self-perpetuating loop of comparing one 's own desire to the stereotype , men can try these techniques : LINKING INTIMACY AND SEX Sidebar There are plenty of men who boldly  --  and coldly  --  go from one conquest to the next . For them , sex is just sex . But many men do n't feel this way . In fact , quite a few need to work their way up from zero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intimacy.A walk on a quiet beach or caressing in front of a fireplace can eventually lead to lovemaking . Even more important is sharing a feeling of closeness and providing genuine emotional support . Satisfying a partner in this way can build a sense of accomplishment  --  and trust-that can help lead to increased desire . DO N'T LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER Sidebar Sexy clothing , dim lighting and suggestive play should get men in the mood . But rather than turn men with HSD on , the extra attention can backfire . Trying to force your partner into the mood can result in anxiety and frustration for both of you . Sometimes the best way for men Sidebar to get around this block is to look for the underlying problem . Going slowly , without pressure , and getting professional help can point you toward a solution . DANISH PESSIMISM Sidebar After a while , one may wonder if desire will ever return . And sometimes , heartfelt attempts at change even through therapy  --  can lead nowhere . Sidebar Do n't give up . Getting past HSD often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to help guide a couple in building intimacy . And it takes work to deal with the issues that have suppressed desire . But this sort of work can result in a stronger overall relationship-and lead to desires and pleasures long forgotten . Sidebar FOR WOMEN ONLY Sidebar Some women blame their hormones ; others fault their upbringing . But for women struggling with HSD , it 's hard not to blame themselves . They should n't . Desire ca n't be turned on with a switch . For women who find themselves without desire , guilt from themselves or their partners can often make things worse . Instead of playing the blame game , try these solutions : WORK ON THE RELATIONSHIP Sidebar Sex therapists agree that the level of a woman 's sexual desire is often determined by how comfortable she is in her relationship . If she is n't sure about what her partner thinks of her-or how much she can trust him-the level of desire may plummet . Underlying problems with intimacy-such as fear of losing control or being controlled , rejection and conflicts leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest Sidebar spending more time together and away from the roles of everyday life.Try , for example , a sight-seeing outing , a bicycle ride or just dinner and a movie . When both partners can get out of their routines , they may well rediscover the joys of spending time together . Simple steps like these can help restore confidence in a relationship . BROADEN THE DEFINITION OF SEX Sidebar When it comes to sex , intercourse is the entire focus for many men . Unfortunately , too many women buy into this idea , as well . And for women with HSD , this intercourse-or-nothing outlook can create real barriers . How about a full-body massage ? Or a good foot rub ? There are many ways partners can please each other without the pressure of having intercourse . And once a woman gets a taste Sidebar for these pleasures , it can build into a desire for more traditional physical sex IT 'S OK TO FANTASIZE Sidebar To some women , fantasizing about sex with someone other than their partner is a betrayal . But fantasy and behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy fantasy life is a way to build up sexual desire . So go ahead : close your eyes and dream of Brad Pitt CREATE A SEXUAL ENVIRONMENT Sidebar Instead of waiting to stumble over sexual desire , women with HSD can work to create a more sexual mental enironment.Take time to think about sex , how to build up a better sex life , or even to plan naughty sexual encounters with your partner . Often , a little proactive thinking will prime the pump of desire , leading to a more receptive state later . Sidebar ADDICTED TO SEX Sidebar If you think the media is sex obsessed , take notes : Even psychologists have a decidedly pro-sex bias . For proof , look no further Sidebar than the " bible " of the psychological profession , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , or DSM . Psychologists use the definitions in the DSM as a means of diagnosing-and treating-mental health problems . The DSM provides a three-part clinical definition for hypoactive sexual desire : Sidebar * Persistently or recurrently deficient ( or absent ) sexual fantasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or absence is made by the clinician , taking into account factors that affect sexual functioning , such as age and the context of the person 's life . * The disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty . Sidebar * The sexual dysfunction is not better accounted for by another disorder ( except another sexual dysfunction ) and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance ( a drug or medication ) or a general medical condition . Sidebar If having little or no sexual desire is a problem , what about wanting too much sex ? The term " sexual addiction " was coined a few years back to describe people with an obsessive sex drive . Yet according to the DSM , wanting too much sex is n't a problem . No diagnosis for sexual addiction is described in its pages . That does n't jibe with the experience of mental health professionals , who see people coming into their offices displaying symptoms of out-of-control sexual desire.And according to Robin Cato , executive director of the National Council on Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinders attempts to help such patients . " Without a DSM listing , few insurance companies are going to pay for treatment , " Cato notes . Not all professionals are enthusiastic about the movement to make sex addiction a disorder ; some dismiss the effort as financially motivated . Michael Ross , Ph.D. , a professor of public health at the University of Texas and the past president of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality , doubts that the evidence is all in . " Sexual addiction , " says Ross , " does not meet the criteria for a classic addiction .
