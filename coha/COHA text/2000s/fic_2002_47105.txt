ANY FOOL WHO TELLS YOU " Space is big " has never been to Texas . We are so big that we 're more or less indifferent to things that folks from the underprivileged parts of this great land of ours would call sensational or spectacular or even just plain weirder'n a rat in tap shoes . When Armageddon hits , it 's more than a little likely we 'll look out across the plains , see the armies of locusts and the rain of blood and the Four Horsemen coming right at us and the most we 'll do is write a stern letter to the local radio station , blaming it all on the Democrats . <p> Yessir , it takes a lot to hold our attention or rile up our curiosity . We make mighty poor tourists . ( I got an uncle who can pee better than Niagara , a cousin who can blow his top more impressive than Mount Saint Helens , and as for the Grand Canyon , well , I 'd rather not talk about my exwife Mercy June too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something interesting out there in the sorry badlands beyond our borders , we do n't feel the need to go jackrabbiting off to hunt it down . Sooner or later it will come to Texas , if it 's all that important . That 's what you call gravity . <p> Only problem with gravity is you do n't get to choose what it picks up and flings at you . This is especially a trial when it decides to fling Easterners . <p> I 'd been working at the Cottonwood ranch for some decades and several administrations of ranch owners when that vexatious female showed up out of New York City and into perdition . Being as I was just an employee of the Cottonwood there was n't much I could do about it . <p> The female in question showed up on account of being the sister of Mrs. Joshua Perdenales Cathcart , the preantepenultimate ex-wife of ol ' Josh P. , third of that name , fifth of that bloodline , and most recent owner of the Cottonwood . Her connection to the ex-Miz Cathcart in and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience or forbearance . Being married to Josh P. was a pretty common condition among the ladies in these parts . Due to his serial attractions to members of the opposite sex , his exes and their subsidiary kinfolk were as thick on the ground as cowpats at a rodeo and only a little less charming . <p> But the circumstances surrounding the arrival of this Eastern woman was somewhat distinct . For one thing , by the time she got to the Cottonwood , Josh P. had taken up the habit of sleeping alone . A coffin will do that to a man . For another , the ex-wife herself had suffered an unexpected interview with a speeding vehicle of some heft while attempting to cross a New York City street within twenty-four hours of josh R 's demise . Us boys down to the bunkhouse remembered this former Mrs. josh P. and her habits , practices , and general comportment pretty good her being closer to Current Events than Ancient History as the alimony check flies - so we could guess what 'd happened . Not meaning to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lush , a boozehound , a gin-swilling , bourbon-belting , whiskey-guzzling rumdum of the first water . Only she never got near the drinking kind of water , first or last , in all the time she was living here . josh P. liked his liquor as well as the next man , but even he got embarrassed by her carryings-on with the grape . You get yourself plastered and strip yourself buck-naked and dance the macarena at the Cattlemen 's Ball once , that 's just high spirits . You 're still socially acceptable . Hell , you 're still presidential material . But you get into the habit of doing it so much that the Cattlemen 's Association starts clearing a time-slot on the dance card , in anticipation of the event , well , it gets to be more than even the most understanding of husbands can bear . <p> So Josh P. divorced her and she went back up north and he just happened to croak a few wives down the pike . His death changed everything - not least of all for him . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was nothing as compared to how much unmitigated **29;723;TOOLONG his Last Will and Testament dropped right into the lady 's lap . Why hers , as opposed to some of the more recent and less shopworn laps that Josh P. had been dropping into after their divorce ? Why , purely because this particular ex-Miz Cathcart had managed to accomplish something , in spite of all her drinking , that put her smack dab in the catbird seat when Josh P. himself went to his reward . Let 's just say josh R 's fortune dropped into her lap on account of what had dropped out of it some years before . <p> As things happened , she did not get to enjoy her windfall worth a damn . Likely as soon as she got word of her former husband 's death she went out to memorialize the sad occasion by getting drunk as an owl . I do n't reckon an owl would have much hope of avoiding an oncoming SUV neither . <p> That was why it was her sister who showed up ; her and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little slow or a high school guidance counselor , was the accomplishment of which I spoke . <p> Now ol ' Josh P. might have got himself married more times than recommended by the United States government ( I think it 's the Department of Agriculture handles such things ) , but you would n't know it by anything ' cept his checkbook . He was not a results-oriented husband . To put it in the Biblical manner , he could n't begat worth a hill of beans . In all the years of all those marriages , this little boy was the only son and/or heir that Joshua Perdenales Cathcart managed to leave behind . <p> That 's what the boy 's birth certificate said , anyhow . What the rest of us had to say was some different . <p> " That 's Josh R 's son ? " Angel said , tilting his chair back against the bunkhouse wall . Ever since word came down that the boy and his aunt was coming , all us ranch hands had been setting out on the porch , waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might call a letdown . " Why , that 's the puniest , scrawniest , milk-and-water weakest excuse for a boy I ever saw ! " <p> Now when Angel said this , it was n't more than five minutes since the car carrying Josh P. the Fourth and his aunt pulled up in front of the ranch house.and let them out . Shoot , the dust off the tires had n't even settled yet . I hear a man can make a damfool of himself if all he goes by is first impressions , but in this case I was inclined to side with Angel . There was just no arguing over it : That boy was paltry , that 's all there was to it . <p> I am not making this up ; I saw it with my own eyes which , in spite of my age , are still sharp . Plus I got witnesses , namely Angel , and the rest of the boys , and Mr. Purvis who was not only our foreman but also a distant cousin of o1 ' Josh P. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee who came out of the ranch house to greet the boy and his aunt as soon as they got there . <p> It did n't get to be much of a greeting . Why , no sooner did that child set foot on the soil of the Cottonwood but he doubled over , wrapped those twiggy arms around that chicken chest of his , screwed up the beadiest pair of eyes I ever did see that was n't attached to some sort of rodent , and started coughing . He coughed long and he coughed hard , worse than a man of sixty who 's been smoking three packs a day and taking a chaw in between , just to keep his hand in . ( And I ought to know , seeing as how that is more or less my own personal history . ) The whole time he was coughing , his aunt was fussing and fluttering around him , chirping and cooing like a box full of turtledoves when she was n't squawking like a singed hen at Mr. Purvis to do something . ( Course when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she threw a cross-body block on him and did n't let him do a damn thing . ) Finally she half-pushed , half-pulled , half-carried that boy inside the ranch house with Mr. Purvis tailing after . <p> As soon as the front door slammed , all us boys on the bunkhouse porch got to talking . Our general mood was not one of optimism , and when Jim came up to join us , things just plain went to hell . <p> Now Jim was the one Mr. Purvis sent to pick up the boy and his aunt at the airport in Dallas , so he 'd had the longest exposure to ' em of anybody . He was usually a fairly cheerful man , but the look on his face at that moment would have caused a cold-blooded rattler to find a gun and evolve itself some fingers just so 's it could stick the barrel in its own mouth and blow its brains out . <p> " It 's bad , boys , " was the first words out of his mouth when he stepped up onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of us had had the bad taste to be Easterners , someone would 've asked " How bad is it ? " That is the sort of thing that Easterners consider to be high hilarity worthy of Don Imus or JoeBob Briggs or Voltaire or someone good like that . But being as how we were all Texans-thank-youJesus , we just set there and waited . Either a man 's going to tell you how bad it is right out or he 's not , in which case you will have to find it out for yourself . That 's what you call one of life 's little options . <p> Jim opted to tell us how bad it was : " You fellers get a look at the boy pretty good ? " We nodded . " Tell me : You get a good look at that aunt of his too ? 11 <p> This time we shook our heads . Truth to say , the aunt had n't registered on our eyeballs so much as on our eardrums , what with all her shrieking and clucking and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had noted in a vague sort of way that she had a fairly attractive physique , even if it was covered up in some of the dowdiest clothes we 'd ever seen since the late , great Minnie Pearl , but that was about as far as we had gotten on the worksheet . <p> Jim got a grim little smile of regretful satisfaction on his face . " Thought so . Well , let me tell you , I did get a good look at her . Boys , that is what you call an angry woman . She 's got more bristles than a javelina - not real ones , but I think you know what I mean - and they 're sticking out like quills every breath she takes . Hostile ? I seen wars that was friendlier . She does look a lot like her sister - if ol ' josh P. was still alive he 'd be making a play for her even as we speak - but a wise man 'd think twice before taking something that flinty to his bed , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a styptic pencil to some very personal portions of his anatomy . " <p> We all shuddered . Jim did have him a way with words . " Yes , sir , I got me a big eyeful of her , all right , " Jim went on . " And a bigger earful . It 's a long drive from Dallas to here and she worsen most women when it comes to the inability to leave a perfectly good silence just lay there . No sir , quiet is something that gets under her saddle blanket and chafes . Yap , yap , yap , all the way from Baggage Claim to the minute we pulled up in front of the big house . Thought I was likely to drive the car off a mountain , only there was n't any convenient to the purpose along our chosen route . I blame the Democrats . " <p> Angel snorted . " Sounds to me like you caught a bad case of the yapping bug yourself , Jim . Any of what you 're saying what a man might call relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry ass thrown out of work by this time next month , " Jim replied . " That relevant enough for you , boy ? " <p> So that was how we got the news that josh P. 's sister-in-law had come down here with the boy not so 's he could embrace his proud Texan heritage but so 's she could sell it off whole or piecemeal for top dollar , then hightail it back to the sorrowful desolations of Up North , Back East , and Central Park West . <p> " She ca n't do that ! " Mitch piped up . He was the only man in our bunkhouse who even come close to being my age , which is considerable , and he had a historic attachment to the Cottonwood . " Who 's she gon na sell the place off to , anyways ? It 's not like there 's folks lined up to buy land what 's only good for raising cattle . Not if the current economic indicators is , well , any kind of current economic indication . " <p> ( Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cumpulsory education during a long stint in a Dallas hospital recovering from a difference of opinion involving football stats , a pool cue , and his skull . The teevee in his room was stuck on CNN and none of us noticed when we come to visit . Thing like that will leave a lasting impression on a man , even more so than the aforementioned pool cue . We blamed our own negligence for his sorry condition and resolved to tolerate the aftereffects like good Christians . ) <p> " All I know is what I had to hear , " Jim said . " She 's more like an adding machine than a woman , that one . There 's a way to squeeze blood out of the Cottonwood acreage , she 'll do it . Then she 'll bag up the squeezings and sell ' em to the Red Cross at a markup . " <p> " She do n't got the right to do it , " Mitch said , looking grim . " It 's not like it 's her spread . It belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the boy belongs to her , " I pointed out . " Or pretty near . He 's a minor , no more'n six , seven years old if he 's day . She 's his legal guardian and closest living relative . That carries weight . She can do whatever she likes in his name and all we got the power to do is bend over , grab our ankles , and hope she do n't hurt us too bad . " <p> " Ten , " said Angel . <p> " Come again , son ? " I asked . <p> " He 's ten years old , " Angel said . " He 's got to be . Ca n't be anything else if he 's who they say he is . That 's how far back Josh P. divorced his mama , remember ? We could hear their last fight clear to the bunkhouse . " <p> " And their last mutual physical reconciliation pact too , " Mitch added . " Which was likely where the boy got his start in life , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ten , " I said . <p> " Boy ca n't help it he 's puny , " Jim said . <p> " Boy ca n't help it who his daddy is either , " I said , stroking my chin . " His real daddy . " <p> May the Good Lord forgive me , I do not know until this very day what possessed me to say something mean-spirited like that . I expect I did it because I was het up some about the possibility of the Cottonwood being sold out from under me in my old age . A man likes a little security when he starts to get on in years . <p> No , that 's a lie . Oh , I cared some about about job security and having someplace safe to spend my declining years - I 'd be seven kinds of fool not to - but it was n't like the subject preoccupied my mind . All my life , I never once took the easy trail if I could help it . There 's a kind of spice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living up or down to expectations . If I got tossed out on my rump on account of that Eastern woman selling off the Cottonwood , I knew I 'd survive . I could get me a fresh start elsewhere , in spite of my years - there was more'n a few folks in those parts who owed me favors . So no , I was not thinking of myself when I said that unholy thing about that scrawny little child 's real daddy . <p> The boys knew what I was thinking , though , you bet . <p> " You 're worried ' bout Cordie , ain'tcha , Sam ? " Angel said . A quick look ' round the faces assembled on the bunkhouse porch and I saw the same notion writ out in their expressions just as plain as though someone 'd taken a big ol ' rubber stamp and thumped CORDIE across their foreheads in bright red ink . Like I said , they knew . <p> I did not appreciate being so plain to read . A man ought to be able to keep something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than talkshow trash . <p> " You blame me ? " I snapped . <p> Angel shook his head and the rest of ' em did likewise . It was like watching a whole row of them bobble-head dogs some folks stick on-their car dashboards . " Blame you , amigo ? Hell , what do you think we 're all most worried ' bout ? " <p> " You ? " I said . " You 're worried ' - bout Cordie ? How come ? Not like he 's your problem . " <p> Angel laughed . " The hell you say , old man , the hell you say . There ai n't a one of us here who do n't have ties of some sort or t' other for him and you know it . Work with a man , ride with him , polish off a few quarts of whiskey in his company while he 's skinning you alive at the poker table and then try telling me you do n't worry on his account when his future looks dicey . " <p> " Dicey ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harsh thing to say . It was also a true thing , and we all knew that , too . For a while , no one spoke . Then Buck broke the silence . <p> Now Buck is a good man , maybe the best man I 'll ever know in this life . He 's what you might call a wrangler 's wrangler , born to the saddle . You want someone knows his way around a horse , Buck 's your man . He 's part Mexican , part Spanish , part Jicarilla Apache , with a touch of real Hawaiian paniolo thrown in for good measure due to his mama having won a trip out to Honolulu on some teevee quiz show back in the sixties where she discovered Mai Tais and made friends with the locals , in no particular order . <p> " Seems to me , " Buck said in the slow-talking way he has . " Seems to me like that boy do n't look too much like the man 's ' sposed to be his daddy . Seems to me that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ladyfriends as ol ' Josh P. did and this lone , puny , pitiful boy is all he 's got to show for it . I ai n't a suspicious man by nature , but did anyone ever hear a word about this child until now ? One single , solitary word ? " <p> Most of us allowed that we had not . Only Jim said different : <p> " There was a letter when he got born . Me and Mr. Purvis was with Josh P. when it come . I never will forget how bright his face lit up when he got word he had him a son . Why , he wrote out a check on the spot for twice the amount his ex was demanding out of him , and he ponied up more every month . There was photos , too . They come whenever she wanted to get a little more out of Josh P. , between monthly installments . " <p> " Photos , " said Buck , shifting his draw from one cheek to the other . " Nothing else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-to-face ? " <p> Jim shook his head . " Not that we ever heard tell . " <p> " Uh-huh . " Buck nodded and looked like he was onto something . <p> It did n't take much for us to tell what . " Oh , no , " I said , shaking my head and feeling deeply pained by what I 'd started . " No sir , Buck , you ai n't thinking of doing that , are you ? " <p> Buck cocked one eyebrow at me . " Sam , you got a good , solid reason why I should n't ? " <p> " But Buck , that 'd be .. cruel . Downright pitiless cruel . " <p> " Who to ? " <p> " The boy , for one . " <p> " The boy ? " Buck laughed . " That sorry little scrap of gristle ? Why should he care if we go raising the question of who his real daddy was ? Seems to me like he 's got enough worries trying to figure out where his next breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if we got a court to rule on this one way or t' other ? " <p> " A court , " I repeated , hoping that I would not have to spell it out for Buck , hoping against hope that I would not need to allow That Word to pass my lips . " That 's just it : If we were fool enough to follow through on this sorry mess , we would have to take it to a court and scare up irrefutable evidence to back our claims and - and have close personal contact with certain unavoidable things with which a court of law is unfortunately connected . You know what I mean . " <p> Gauging from how everybody shuddered , I reckon they did . <p> " You mean lawyers ? " Mitch piped up without it being strictly necessary at all . <p> We all froze . He 'd said That Word . There was n't a one of us present but had had some previous dealings with That Word and come out the worse for it . Any other man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus and the dog , we'd 've taken him off a decent distance and acquainted him with seven kinds of pain and five of affliction . Seeing as how it was Mitch , though , we had to grit our teeth and bear with it . It was n't like the man could endure another blunt head trauma ; not unless he was looking to make himself fit for nothing but a career in politics . <p> " That 's - that 's what I meant , all right , " I said , wincing some . " Which is why we should not speak of this course of action any further . " <p> " Why not ? " Buck persisted . " It 's the one way we 've got to cut that money-hungry harpy off at the pass ; the only way . She 's got her talons in the Cottonwood through the boy and he 's got a claim based solely on him being Josh P. 's seed . When I take a tick off my dog I do n't just pull off the body ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I shook my head . " I do n't like this . " <p> Angel laid a hand on my shoulder . " You got to , Sam . For Cordie 's sake , you got to . " <p> Well , that was where we left the matter that day . We had us our formal introductions to the boy and his aunt later on , closer to suppertime . That was where we learned that her name was Miz Josette Marie Lewis and that the boy was called Fowler . <p> Fowler ! If that did n't add insult to the injury of o1 ' Josh R 's already being dead , I do n't know what did . Oh , the pup still carried his so-called daddy 's name , but tucked back a ways . He was Fowler Theodore Joshua Cathcart on his birth certificate , with the noble Perdenales left by the wayside entire like a box of spare kittens . It was a shame , I tell you , a burning , crying , gut-gnawing shame . <p> ' Course it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of thinking , much as he tried to persuade me otherwise later that same night . That man talked to me and at me and over me and through me . I have never been jawed at quite so efficient in my life , and I been married . He kept on talking , too , trying to get me to join in on pursuing the case he was already building up in his mind . He 'd got the other boys to fall in with him easy after the whole sorry Fowler episode . I was the lone holdout . <p> " But it was your idea to start with ! " he protested . <p> " And as such it 's my prerogative to take it out behind the barn , hit it with a shovel , and bury it as deep as it 'll go , " I replied . " I tell you , you ca n't know that the boy wo n't mind if you start talking trash ' bout who his real daddy was , even if he never met the man 's supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truckload of mud over the memory of his mama , and there 's not a soul alive , man or boy , will stand for that . " <p> Buck made a dismissive sound . " He 's young and she 's dead . He 'll get over it . " <p> " I do n't care what you say , " I held on . " There has got to be another way around this . There has just got to . " <p> Well , they left me alone after that . We all went to sleep and when we got up the next morning no one said another word to me about little Josh 's paternity ( I was prepared to swallow a Gila monster head first before I would think of that helpless child by the name Fowler ) . Being somewhat of an optimist , which is just a crossword puzzle way of saying idjit , I even believed that I had got them to forget about the whole nasty thing too . <p> It was just after supper some two days later that Miz Josette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunkhouse , bold as brass , to where we was all sitting out on the porch again . She planted her fists on her hips and shot us a look that could fry mutton . <p> " Which one of you barbarians is Samuel Henry Redburn ? " she demanded in a voice so deep and rumbly with anger that half of us was checking the sky for thunder while the other half was checking her upper lip for a mustache . <p> " That 'd be me , ma'am , " I said , readily enough . I got up off of my chair and gave the lady a little by-courtesy bow like my mama taught me . " What can I do for you ? " <p> " Come with me , " she said . I thought for a minute there I heard her teeth grinding together when she said that , but that is what you call a linguistic impossibility . She turned on her heel and stalked away , back toward the big house . I did not obey her straight off . First I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part honest puzzlement and part coldeyed suspicion . They tried to look innocent and sympathetic , both of which was dead giveaways that they 'd done something for which I was about to feel the spiky business end of a lady 's wrath . <p> Well , you only need to die once . I went after her . <p> She did not stop walking- never once looking back to see if I 'd come along with her as ordered - until we was past the big house and out by the corral . It was empty at that hour , the horses bedded down for the night , and none of the other ranch buildings within earshot even was a person to start yelling at another person at the top of her lungs . Which she did . <p> I do not wish to subject another living being to the sort of abuse that poured out of that woman 's mouth and down my ear-holes . Anger played her voice like a theramin , sending it from the depths of harlton Heston to the heights of PeeWee Herman , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are prepared to do me the kindness of hearing out what I got to tell you , I am not going to presume upon your generosity by making you sit through a whole lot of yammer that basically boiled down to the fact that as far as Miz Josette Marie Lewis was concerned , I was a man who had all the socially redeeming value of squirrel snot . <p> Now it did not take a college degree for me to figure out what had brought out this ugliness in what was an otherwise handsome woman . Soon as she stopped the eruption of venom to take a breath , I leaped into the breach and said , " This is about the boy , ai n't it ? " <p> " Yes , it 's about the boy ! " she snapped back . " My God , how stupid are you ? " <p> I decided to let that slide by . " How 'd you find out ? " <p> " That you were plotting to steal poor little Fowler 's inheritance right out from under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , dead sister 's name with any kind of filth you could get your stinking hands on ? That you 've got the pure , unadulterated gall to claim that poor baby is a bastard ? " <p> Poor and poor and poor , that 's how she tried to make me feel sorry for what the boys were trying to do to o1 ' josh R 's supposed offspring . Well , that 's the rich for you . <p> " Yes 'm , " I replied . <p> " A phone call came today , " she told me . " A call from our attorney in New York . He has received word from some two-bit Dallas shyster that the late Mr. Cathcart 's will is going to be contested in the Texas courts . Naturally he informed me as to the basis for such an action as well as the identity of the person who had instigated this - this - this abomination . " <p> I sighed and leaned back against the corral railing . " Ma'am , " I said , " judging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think this was all my idea . Well , it 's not . Oh , I did have the bad judgment to think aloud along those lines and some of the boys overheard me . They 're the ones as set the wheels in motion , and I suspicion they thought they was doing the right thing , putting my name to it , giving credit where it 's due , whether or not it was ever asked for . I tried talkin ' ' em out of it , but - " <p> " I 'll just bet you did , " she snarled . " Come off it , cowboy . That Aw , shucks , ' tware n't nothin ' routine may work on the inbred brain-dead bimbos you 've got down here in the boondocks , but I went to Vassar ! " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I said , still holding myself in check . After all , like the lady said , she went to Vassar . She 'd suffered enough . <p> " You admit it was your idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the trigger of the guns that killed the Romanovs , but do n't try telling me he had nothing to do with their fate ! " <p> " No , ma'am , " I said . " And the nineteenth-century financiers , industrialists , and oligarchs whose ruthless exploitation of the proletariat created the perfect socioeconomic milieu to foster the viability of Marxist doctrine becoming reality were somewhat involved in the shooting as well . " <p> It took the lady some time to get her jaw up off the ground after that . ( I guess a little of Mitch 's enforced CNN viewership rubbed off on me some while I was visiting him . ) Before she was once more sufficiently collected to resume telling me what a pile of rattlesnake poop I was , I decided to lay hold of the upper hand . <p> " Ma'am , I know you hate me and you got every right to . That boy , I reckon he 's the only kin you got left in this world , ai n't that so ? " She did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman-shutting-up benefits of higher education I 'd 've finished eighth grade long ago . " Well , that 's what I thought , " I said . " And you just want what 's best for him , right ? " She nodded again . " Only thing is , you ca n't help it if you got kind of a limited viewpoint on the subject . The way I see it , you assume that more money 's the answer to everything . " <p> By that time she 'd found her voice again and she used it to declare , " Of course it is ! Anyone with a scrap of sense knows that . " <p> " Well , beggin ' your pardon , ma'am , but you 're wrong ; dead wrong . There 's things in this world that money wo n't buy , no matter how many infomercials you listen to . There 's things that 'll do a boy a lot more good than a fat bank book . " <p> " Lovely sentiment , " she sneered . " Shall I cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I will be the first to admit it , the woman was starting to rile me . I could feel my jaw muscles tighten up with every contemptful word that came out of her mouth . I have never struck a lady in my life , except in selfdefense during a fair bar fight , but I have read any number of senior citizenoriented periodicals that encourage us to embrace new experiences as a way of keeping our spirits young and I was about this far from embracing the experience of giving Miz Josette Marie Lewis a healthy boot to the tailbone . <p> I took a deep breath , ready to give the woman one last chance to go back East with her hindquarters untrammeled . " Ma'am - " I began . <p> " Oh , stop that ma'am crap , " she said , curt . " I 'm having flashbacks to every Gary Cooper , Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart Western my father ever forced me to watch . Call me Ms. Lewis . " <p> " Is that what the boy calls you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Do n't be ridiculous . Fowler calls me josette . " <p> Well sir , that brought me up short and no mistake . " You mean to stand there and tell me that that little boy , your nephew , your dead sister 's son , your one and only blood kin in this mean and sorry world , calls you by your name ? " <p> She shrugged . " What 's the big deal ? I gave him permission to do so . " " But you 're his aunt ! " I protested . " Not his waitress . How come you do n't have the boy call you Aunt or Auntie or - or - or , I du n no , something like that in Latin or French , one of them high-class dead languages ? You 're kinfolk . It ai n't right for kinfolk to have barriers between ' em , even if they 're only words . " <p> She cocked her head and looked at me like I 'd been caught chewing a mouthful of loco weed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - for trying to separate Fowler from half his parentage and all his financial security . What the hell do you really care about - " She made a face like she 'd just tongue-kissed a Democrat . " - kinfolk ? " <p> That was it . That was purely it . My patience was gone , my forbearance in the face of disadvantages like Eastern rearing and a Vassar education had been exhausted . I stood tall . My eyes narrowed . My jawline turned to steel and stone . Too bad that night was coming in ; I looked impressive , all right , but there was n't light enough for the lady to get the full effect . <p> " You go ask anyone on this ranch ' bout my stance concerning kinfolk , Miz Lewis , " I said . " Onliest reason I ever let them unfortunate words out of my mouth - the things I said ' bout how maybe ol , Josh P. was n't that boy 's real daddy - was ' counta my own kinfolk and the debt I owe ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cottonwood , like we heard tell you was planning to do - " <p> The woman clicked her tongue and tossed her chin up just a mite , like when you find your dog 's left a puddle on the floor but you know it 's no use getting angry ' cause he 's too dumb to learn and if you shot him he 'd be too dumb to die . " Oh , for the love of God , you moron , is that where all this legal folderol came from ? Because you and the rest of those lazy ticks thought I 'd sell the ranch and toss you out without a dime ? That was never my intention - not originally . I was going to provide each of you with a tidy severance package , but now ? I 'd be lying if I said that I have n't changed my mind after what you 're trying to pull . When I got that phone call from my attorney - " <p> " There you go again , back to the money like a dog to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gon na try listening for a change , woman ? It was n't the money that got me her up over losing the Cottonwood . It was n't how I might not have where to lay my head if you threw me off the ranch . It was Cordie , godammit ! It was n't nothing else but Cordie , it never was , and it never will be ! " <p> I was shouting pretty good by the time I got to the end of my breath . It was a wonder that no one up to the big house heard me . Or maybe they did , but soon as they heard me say Cordie 's name I reckon they decided I 'd reached the point of no return and was prepared to kill Miz Lewis with my own two hands and no one wanted to be a witness . <p> When the echoes died down some , the lady was staring at me with the first hint of respect I 'd yet seen in them eyes . Respect , or maybe just plain terror to find herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who - who 's Cordie ? " she asked . <p> " My son , " I said . And I began to cry . <p> IT WAS NEXT MORNING , about an hour before dawn , that I found myself , against my better judgment , riding escort for Miz Lewis as we headed off into the far western acreage of the Cottonwood ranch . I did n't favor the circumstances under which we 'd set out . The terrain out thataway was mostly trackless scrub and rough going besides . A Jeep could take you there , but it would n't be a pleasant experience for you or the vehicle . Best way to go , if you absolutely could not avoid it , was in the saddle , and then you ran the risk of having your horse put his foot down an old prairie dog burrow , fall and break both your necks . If that 'd happen to Miz Lewis , you know I 'd be looking down the barrel of a murder charge . <p> But the lady insisted . I guess she trusted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not to lie to her . Because that was what she thought I 'd done , soon as I could stop crying like a baby and tell her all about Cordie . <p> " That has got to be the biggest load of bull I 've ever heard , " she declared . <p> " You do n't know the half , " I told her . <p> " If you expect me to believe that unspeakable lie for one solitary instant , you 're a bigger fool than I imagined . It 's - why , it 's not merely improbable , it 's impossible . " <p> " Yes 'm , " I said . " But it 's true anyhow . I 'd be pleased to have the other boys tell you so . " <p> " Why should I believe them any more than you ? just because you turned on the waterworks ? Is that supposed to convince me of anything ? " <p> " Miz Lewis , if you was n't from back East you 'd know that when a man of my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . I realize that the New York men you 're used to , they cry at the drop of a stock option , but the way I hear it , they 're about as much kin to actual men as tofu is to sirloin . Now here in Texas - " <p> " Get horses , " she interrupted . <p> " Beg pardon ? " <p> " I said have a pair of horses saddled up and ready to go before sunrise tomorrow . I do n't need to hear any more about your views on Texas or New York City - where , by the way , real men do cry , they ca n't help it that they 're all gay . I am calling your bluff , sir . What you 've told me about this so-called son of yours , this - this Cordie-person , goes beyond ludicrous . Why , even if it were true - " <p> That was when I left , sooner than have to hear her go on any more about what a bald-face liar I was . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's about to take a woman out to a desolate stretch of country , could be he might get him some unsociable ideas no matter how good his mama raised him . <p> I will say this for Miz Josette Marie Lewis : She could sit a horse . She curled her lip some at the Western saddle , but she mounted up and rode away like a trooper . She went so far as to be dressed proper for the occasion - good , solid boots ; dungarees , even if she called ' em " jeans " ; a longsleeved cotton shirt to keep the sun off and a bandanna at her neck to wipe away the sweat . ' Course she did wear one of them floppy straw sissy garden hats instead of a decent Stetson , but that would 've been asking too much . By the time we reached Cordie 's stompin ' grounds the sun was up and it was blazing , but nary a peep of complaint out of her the whole way . If I did n't think the woman was poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> We rode on across country that the Devil would n't own on a bet , ' cept Jesus made him . Only pretty thing about it was the Texas sky above , blue and bright and big enough to hold anything a man might care to dream . Finally I caught sight of the old cabin ruins . " See there ? " I said , reining in my horse and pointing across the flats . " That 's where we used to bunk , back when you could still pasture a few hundred head of longhorns out here . " <p> " Longhorns ? " she echoed . " How ... quaint . " <p> " Quaint enough to bring in a pretty penny when the big Hollywood studios wanted to shoot a Western . 0l ' Josh R 's daddy got the idea and he rented ' em out at a good price , you bet . Quaint enough for some hotshots off one of the other spreads to try their hand at rustling ' em , too , back in the day . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play nursie to the cows ? " <p> " One at a time , yes 'm . Could n't spare more'n that from regular ranch work . " <p> " Why did he stop ? The bottom fall out of the oater market ? " <p> " No 'm . " I cleared my throat . Even after all these years I still did not feel entirely comfortable in admitting to what had happened to me out here , what had put an end to a man riding solitary longhorn patrol . Oh , I know I 'd already told her all about it , but she did n't believe it . That made it sort of like it 'd never happened . Lord knows I often wished it had not , though I took back that selfish thought every time I laid eyes on my son , but still <p> " Well , now , " I said , talking slow , so as to put off the inevitable . " Well , the way it is , we do still raise longhorns on this acreage - not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land ca n't support ' em- only for about the past twenty-five years we ai n't stood in need of keeping one of the ranch hands out here . You do n't know how hard it was , back then , for a man on his lonesome . It do n't matter how many supplies he 's got to live on or how much whiskey , he still needs a little .. companionship . It 's only human . Ol ' Josh P. Is daddy , he was a good boss , but there was two things about him that rile me to this day : He expected his orders to be obeyed , no matter what , and he had a tendency to be forgetful . So when he told me I was s'posed to stay out here and mind the cattle and not come back until I was sent for , I did like I was told . Hell , I was young and eager to please and the only time I ever thought to question authority was to ask How high ? ' when my boss told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about sending for me within what any decent soul would consider to be a reasonable length of time - namely one full calendar year , by God - that was when I got so lonely that one night I drunk myself stupid and went out onto the range and I proceeded to - " <p> " What 's that ? " Miz Lewis asked , pointing at the horizon . I had the feeling she 'd only been half-listening to me and this proved it , her interrupting me like that . It was rude by anybody 's standards , even Easterners ' . <p> I tugged the brim of my Stetson down some and peered into the distance where a fair-sized cloud of dust was rising . " That 'll be the reason no one else has to endure what I endured that long , lonesome year , " I said , solemn . " That 'll be my boy Cordie . He always seems to know when I 'm here . " <p> We heard the sound of hoofbeats soon after we got our first sight of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thunder . The wind shifted and we caught the smell of cattle along with something extra , something special , something downright out of the ordinary . I knew to expect it , so I held my horse on a tight rein , but Miz Lewis lacked my experience and her horse shied like a mad thing . She tried to regain control , only she was a little late . The smell was just too unnatural for the poor critter and it reacted to her pull on the reins by leaping straight up into the air and shaking itself like a wet hound on the way down . My worst fears came to pass : Miz Lewis went flying from the saddle , her skull heading right for a date with one of the half-tumbled walls from the ruined cabin . <p> God bless my son Cordie . <p> That boy was speed personified , and that 's a fact . One minute he was a dot on the horizon , the next he was right there , arms outstretched just like some kind of superhero come to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hugged her to his bosom before she even had the time to utter a scream . I could not help but tear off my hat and wave it in the air , letting loose with a war whoop to see how slick he did it . Cordie blushed and pretended I was n't there , just like he always done when he was a teenager . <p> " Ma'am , " he said to Miz Lewis , polite like I taught him . That floppy garden hat of hers had fallen over her face when he snatched her up , so he pushed it back for her real gentle and asked : " You all right ? " <p> The woman was a study , I 'll tell you what . Her hair under the sissy hat was sticking out every whichaway , her eyes were wide with fear , her limbs a-tremble . She had both arms wrapped tight around my son 's neck and she huddled up against his chest so snug I expected she 'd leave a mark if we could ever pry her loose again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just as soft and sweet and inviting as his mama 's , and he gave her a smile that could 've melted stone . <p> And it did , too . I never did see a woman go from being a chip of flint with legs to a natural gal that fast . Not without she 'd been reading romance novels . " You - you saved my life , " she breathed . <p> " Aw , shucks , " said Cordie , cradling her with one arm , the better to show off his strength for the lady . " ' Tware n't nothin ' . " <p> That was when he tilted back his Stetson to wipe the sweat from his brow . <p> That was when she saw the horns . <p> That was also about when she looked down and noticed that while Cordie was at the proper height from the ground for a mounted man , he was not mounted on anything . Anything ' cept his ownself . From the waist up my son was all man - almost all , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprouting off his forehead - but from the waist down , well .... <p> " You 're a cowl " Miz Lewis shrieked . <p> Cordie looked hurt . " Bull , ma'am , " he said . <p> But she was n't listening . Again . She was squirming and kicking and pounding on my son 's chest like it was a busted vending machine . The fact that he had just saved her life was forgotten . And the whole time she struggled to break free of him she was screaming , " No , no , no ! This ca n't be ! This is n't happening ! It 's hideous , it 's unnatural , it 's wrong ! Let me go , you monster ! Let me go ! " <p> My poor son . It would 've broke your heart to see how deep that harpy 's ugly words wounded him . He always was the sweetest thing , friendly , living by the Golden Rule and believing with an his innocent heart that everybody else in this wicked world was doing the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys , maybe even cheated some , according to Jim , but no one 's perfect . ) He 'd 've been within his rights to drop her - right smack on her thick head , for preference but I 'd raised him too chivalrous . He set her down gentle on her feet and backed away . <p> This was not enough to satisfy that odious woman . She looked this way and that , desperate as a cornered rat , until her eyes lit on some of the rocks from the cabin 's fallen chimney . Before I could stop her she 'd picked up one in either hand and flang ' em at my boy . Cordie saw , em coming and turned so they only hit him on the flank . Why he did not turn tail and run I do n't know . Could be it was ' counta I was there and he did n't want to have his daddy think he was a coward . They was good-sized rocks , big enough to raise puffs of dust where they struck his tawny hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never did more than snort and back a little farther away from that lunatic female . <p> When she bent down to lay hands on a second set of rocks , I 'd had a bellyful . I forced my horse between her and Cordie , saying : " Miz Lewis , you leave my son be . " <p> " Your son , " she repeated . Then she tossed her head back and cackled . " And here I thought you were just making some sort of hideous joke . " <p> " No 'm , I was not , " I said , feeling my fingers curl and wishing I might be able to wrap them around her scrawny neck some , as a moral lesson . " His Christian name 's Cordero Custis Redburn and he 's the reason you ca n't sell the Cottonwood . This is the only home the boy 's ever known . This is where he 's got his roots , his work , his future . " <p> Again she let fly with that witchy laugh . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious ' kinfolk ' ? This is the reason you wanted to call my sweet nephew 's legitimacy into question ? To shelter a monstrosity ? Dear God , I do n't know whether to notify the National Enquirer , Jerry Springer , or Swift 's Premium Meats ! " <p> I realize now that she did n't mean what she was saying . She 'd had a shock , a bad one , and it was only natural for her to go a little crazy after . She was n't a bad person , just an Easterner . I reckon they 're like fleas , and if God can put up with so many of ' em , we Texans should try to do our part . <p> But I was n't exactly thinking straight myself , right then . All I knew was that this woman was meanmouthing my Cordie something brutal , and I was n't about to stand for it . I had n't been the best of fathers-had n't even known there was a Cordie until those first reports started drifting back to the bunkhouse from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me - but once I knew he existed I 'd done what I could for him . I cut him out of the herd . I taught him to talk . I got him dressed up as decent as possible , even though pants was out of the question . I educated him to read and write and cipher . I gave him the same lessons in manners that my mama gave me . I even traveled all the way to Dallas to fetch back a blind minister so 's he could be baptized , all right and proper . ( The heavens did n't come tumbling down when we done it , so I reckon God did n't mind . ) And I 'd never once turned my back on him ; never . Blood is blood . Kin is kin . <p> Unfortunately , Easterners are Easterners . <p> " This can not go on ! " Miz Lewis decreed . " What if little Fowler were to hear of it ? What would he think ? What horrid , horrid questions might he ask ? I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You - " She leveled a finger at my Cordie . " I will have you removed from this property at once , today , and placed in the hands of the scientific authorities where you belong . " <p> " Yes 'm , " was all Cordie could reply . My sweet son sounded ready to die from misery . <p> I could feel the blood throbbing in my head , turning my eyesight crimson every time I looked at that devil-woman . " The hell you will ! " I bawled at her . " Scientific authorities , my withered ass ! You just want to sell my boy to the highest bidder . You do n't care do they cut him up for study or keep him in a pen for staring at or grind him down for dog food ! Well , I do . You hurt him and I 'll serve your sickly runt of a nephew the same way . I will run you down where you stand . You even think of saying one word about him to anyone who 's not kin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're crazy ! " <p> The woman drew herself up as tall as possible . " You would n't dare . " Het up like she was , her true nature blazed through all the layers of primand-proper dowdiness she 'd wrapped around herself . It even overcame that stupid hat . She was proud and brave and defiant and even noble , in a wrongheaded way . I recollect thinking Get a little high spirits in thatn makes her downright pretty , though to tell the truth those thoughts were not in the forefront of my mind at the time . No sir , right then my main , my only concern was Cordie , and that was where I made my big mistake . See , I decided that small as she was , and unarmed , and out in the middle of nowhere , what could a mere woman do to me ? I reckoned she was pretty much defanged , so I turned my head away from her and looked to Cordie . It was a pity how bad he was taking her ravings . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daddy 's good looks ( Folks have said I bore more than a passing resemblance to Randolph Scott in my younger days ) and his mama 's sweet temper , and here was that Eastern hellcat , that New York shrew , that **25;754;TOOLONG , that - that - that woman making him feel like he was some sort of monster . My Cordie was no monster . I have been to war and to Washington D.C. and let me tell you , I know monsters . <p> But I did not know women . I never imagined what a particularly spunky member of that species is capable of . While I was distracted by my boy 's sorrow , she came up on my left side , grabbed my arm , and yanked me clean out of the saddle . I had n't barely hit the dirt before she was mounted up , the reins in her hands . <p> " Mr. Redburn , I am going to fetch the authorities ! " she announced . " By the time you make it back to civilization , the Cottonwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents , and gentlemen of the press . " <p> I spat out a mouthful of Texas and said , " Think you 'll tell ' em about Cordie and they 'll come ? They 'll never believe you ! You would n't believe me when I first told you ! " <p> She laughed . My horse , not used to a stranger in the saddle , did a little sideways dance but she forced him to mind . " Do you believe I 'd tell them the real story right away ? I 'm no fool . My plan is to hide Fowler somewhere and report that the child wandered off , or fell down an old , abandoned well shaft or - or - " A hellish gleam came into her eye . " - or that one Cordero Custis Redburn kidnapped him ! Thus 11 bring them , and then - " <p> Well , we never did find out what then , because whatever it was , it could n't keep my horse under control worth a damn . What with Cordie 's particular scent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fractious , shrill female , the poor , put-upon thing could n't take no more . He did n't give any warning , did n't buck , he just bolted . Yes sir , he took off at speed for the great wide open , with Miz Josette Marie Lewis clinging to his back , shrieking like an ambulance siren . <p> Which , of course , only served all the more to encourage him to beat the land speed record in an attempt to get the hell away from whatever was making that ungodly racket so near his ears . <p> I picked myself up off the ground . " Stupid woman , " I grumbled as I brushed dirt off my dungarees . " Stupid horse . Good riddance to the both of ' em . " <p> Cordie 's hand fell on my shoulder . " Come on , Pa , " he said . " You can ride me until we find the first horse-the one that throwed her- and then you can mount up proper . If we hurry , I bet we can catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boy , are you crazy ? " I barked . I picked up her fool hat , which had gone flying off when my horse ran off with her , and I waved it under my son 's nose while I spoke . " Did n't you hear what that gorgon said ? You understand what she has in mind for you ? Let the Devil look after his own . There 's a big ol ' abandoned prairie dog town off the way she 's headed . Plenty of holes , plenty of opportunities , if you get my drift . If we 're lucky , my horse wo n't break his neck at the same time he breaks hers . " <p> It was a cruel thing to say , unnatural cruel , but godammit , that woman got me mad . Cordie was not used to hearing me talk so inhuman . He blinked at me a couple times , looking about as horrorstruck as an honest man confronted by the personified vengeance of God which some folks call " lite " beer . Without another word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with hooves flying , hell-for-leather after that Eastern gal . <p> I watched him go . It was the first time I ever realized that just because a child is flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone , that do n't mean he 's gon na pay you any mind when it do n't suit him . I shook my head sadly and tossed the lady 's hat into the ruins of the old cabin . After that there was n't nothing I could do but track down Miz Lewis 's original mount , which was not too difficult , and ride back to the ranch house alone . <p> By the time I got back it was past nightfall . Mr. Purvis and the boys was gathered out in front of the big house with little Josh riding Angel 's shoulders . The men looked worried , but the boy was chipper enough . I reckon they 'd made up some kind of cock-and-bull story about his missing kin so 's he would n't fret . <p> " Where 's Josette ? " he asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auntie 's out having herself a complete tour of the Cottonwood , " I said . " She 'll be back when it suits her . " I gave Angel a look . His mama did n't raise no dumb kids ; he understood he had to get little Josh out of the way so I could speak to the men honest . <p> " What do you say you come with me out to the barn , amiguito ? " he asked the boy . " Go spend some more time with that pinto pony we was playing with before . " <p> " Sure , Angel , I 'd like that , " little Josh said , just as natural . " And can I try riding him tomorrow ? " <p> " I 'd be pleased if you would . " Angel grinned . He did have a fondness for children . " Tell you what , you get up early enough and I 'll even let you come down to the bunkhouse and join us for breakfast , maybe even have yourself a real man 's cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ josh 's eyes got that wide . " Cool ! I did n't know you had a Starbuck 's around here . " <p> " A what ? " asked Angel . <p> " Can I have a latte ? Mocha java ? With a chocolate biscotto ? Please , can I , please , huh , please ? I promise not to get hyperactive , honest . " <p> Angel led him off to the barn looking like a man who 's just adopted hisself a baby Martian . Even with the boy still talking so 's only another Easterner could follow , it was a pure joy to see how much better little Josh looked than he 'd done when he first arrived at the Cottonwood . Robust . Thriving . More like he was actual blood-kin to the man who was supposed to have sired him . <p> A good dose of Texas : It does work miracles . <p> Soon as Angel had little Josh out of the way , I told the rest of the boys what had happened . Some of them had the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked grave . <p> " We ca n't leave it like this , boys , and you all know it , " he said . " That woman may have no other kin than that man-child , but she 's got lawyers . You know they wo n't let her simply disappear , no matter how pleasant or convenient that might be . They 'll habeas the living hell out of all our sorry corpuses until they find out what happened . " <p> We knew him to be right , no getting around it . Buck sighed . " All right , Mr. Purvis , we 'll saddle up and go looking for her body come morning . " Everyone agreed we 'd keep the news from the boy until there was something definite , and on that depressing note we all turned in for the night . <p> Well , we rode the Cottonwood spread for the best part of five whole days , searching , and we did n't find a damn thing . No sign of Miz Lewis , no sign of Cordie . There 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we could n't even track ' em . At first I was some concerned about keeping little josh in the dark as to his missing aunt , but when I tried to broach the subject he looked me right in the eye and said : <p> " Oh , I 'm not worried , Mr. Redburn , sir . I know it 's going to take her a long time to see the whole ranch . After all , it 's Texas . Texas is big . And you know what else ? It 's wonderful . " <p> I tell you what , that innocent boy 's words brought a lump to my throat . " Son , Mr. Redburn was my daddy , " I told him . " You can call me Sam . " <p> " Only if you swear you 'll kick the heck out of anyone who calls me Fowler , " little Josh replied with a grin . He 'd put on flesh , got a tan , had n't coughed for days , was beginning to raise a prime crop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere he went , like they 'd been born joined at the - Well , whom I to say ? When Lucille the cook reported that the little scamp had pinched her behind and called her darlin ' , the boys dropped their lawsuit contesting ol ' josh P. 's will , seeing as how there was n't nothing a DNA test was gon na tell us that Nature had not already done . <p> But that did not bring back the boy 's aunt or my son . <p> It was a full week later , a day that dawned bright and clear , when Mr. Purvis announced he did n't have no more options but to call in the law . He was standing on the bunkhouse steps , telling us this , when all of a sudden we heard the sound of hoofbeats and our nostrils filled with that particular smell that only had one source on this whole misbegotten planet . <p> " Cordie ! " Mitch shouted , rushing to the porch railing and leaning out to greet the approaching cloud of dust . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boys yipping for joy like a pack of coyotes . <p> Cordie and Miz Lewis came riding up to the front of the bunkhouse all brisk and smiling , just like the past week had n't happened . She was sitting him astraddle with his Stetson perched on her head , both her boots missing , likewise one leg of her " jeans " and most of her shirt . I have seen pack-rat nests neater than her hair and old saddles less brown and beat-up than her skin , but I have never , as God is my witness , ever seen a smile that wide on another human being 's face before or since . <p> Less'n you want to count Cordie 's . Of course when a man is wearing a lady 's brassiere where he by rights should be wearing his bandanna , I reckon he 's got what to smile about . <p> The way Cordie told it afterwards , he 'd caught up to her before my horse could throw her , snatching her out of the saddle to safety . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she begged his pardon for all the mean things she 'd said and asked him could he get her back to the ranch house , real polite . <p> Well , he was n't one to hold a grudge , ' specially against a lady , so Cordie agreed . But my horse 's run for the border had brought them even deeper into the middle of nowhere than the ruined cabin , most nearly up to the foothills of what ol ' josh P. used to call the Pissant Mountains . ( I do n't know how they 're labeled on the gov'ment maps , but they ai n't much by Texas standards so for all of us Cottonwood ranch hands the Pissant Mountains they remain . ) <p> " He was wonderful , " Mix Lewis gushed , eating up Cordie with her eyes . " There we were , stranded in the wilderness , night coming on , the air turning chill , wild beasts howling all around us . " <p> " Coyote , " Cordie said , blushing . " Just the one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modesty . " It was wolves , " she insisted . " Ferocious , man-eating wolves , a hundred or more . I heard them . " She tilted back her head and did us a creditable imitation of an asthmatic senior citizen coyote . We all agreed it was wolves . " He was n't afraid , not for an instant , " she went on . " He carried me into the foothills where there was a cave he knew . He built us a fire , he hunted down some game birds for our dinner and then , afterwards , he - he - Well , we got to talking . " She batted her eyelashes at him , then turned to me and purred , " Mr. Redburn , your son is a fascinating conversationalist . " <p> Is that what they 're calling it back East these days ? Alone together in a foothill cave for seven whole , uninterrupted days of ... conversation ? I looked at Cordie , still with that woman 's brassiere around his neck . He had the good grace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other fellers began to snicker , but Mr. Purvis soon put a stop to that . <p> " Lady says they talked , then that 's what they did , " he barked . " All they did . Savvy ? " <p> We savvied . <p> Miz Lewis and Cordie got married soon thereafter , by the same blind minister as had baptized my boy . Like me , he was getting on in years , but he was right proud we 'd thought enough of him to fetch him all the way from Dallas to perform the wedding . <p> Seeing as how fine Texas was agreeing with her nephew as well as with her ownself , Miz Lewis - I mean Miz Redburn - dropped all plans to sell off the Cottonwood . It was the best damn decision that woman ever made . Little josh continued to thrive and flourish to the point where he no longer needed me to lick anyone who tried to calling him by his sissified Eastern name . As far as handing out whoopass went , the boy became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally retired a few years later and moved in with Cordie and his bride when they insisted . Me and the boys had rebuilt the old cabin for them because Cordie liked living out on the range and it gave their kids room to run free . They were a wild bunch , and for obvious reasons it never did do their mama one lick of good to yell at them to close the door , was they born in a barn . <p> I was sitting on the cabin porch one evening , watching the shadows pull out long , when I saw little josh come riding up to the place . He was n't so little no more , and the pinto pony 'd been retired in favor of a big roan stallion . <p> " Sam ! Hey , Sam ! " he shouted , waving his Stetson with one hand as he reined his horse to a halt with the other . " Guess what ? I just got the word : I 've been accepted to college ! " <p> " Vassar ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a face . " Hell , no . I 'm going somewhere with some class . " <p> " And where might that be , son ?

" <p> " They 're the reason I 'm doing this , Sam , " little Josh said . All at once he looked about ten years older than he was , a grooved man with a grooved man 's sense of his responsibilities . " To make my kinfolk proud . You think I 'd leave the Cottonwood otherwise ? Auntie Jo says that an educated man could take care of his family better than an ignorant one , and Uncle Cordie never does stop telling me how much he regrets not being able to get an education . He says he probably could 've learned a thing or two at college that'd 've helped make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I 'm doing it for her , and for him , and for all of my cousins , and even for my poor , dead daddy who left me this place . But most of all , Sam , I 'm doing it for Texas . " <p> He gazed out over the land , and the look of pure love I saw on his face made me realize that he was n't seeing the waste and the desolation an Easterner would claim to see . No sir , when he set an eye to the sagebrush and the clumps of buffalo grass , the lonely mesquite trees and the prairie dog towns and the bumbling ' dillos and the only silence big enough to let a man think without commercial interruption , he saw what I saw : He saw home . <p> I wiped away a tear of pride and joy , hoping he had n't seen that . " What 're you gon na study , little Josh ? " I asked . " Economics ? Business ? Agriculture ? " <p> He puffed out his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the great Lone Star State flag flying proud and glorious behind him as he opened his mouth and said : " Animal husbandry .
