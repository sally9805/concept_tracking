<p> A green jacket was draped over Hootie Johnson 's broad shoulders and the hint of a smile played above his square jaw as he spoke . The chairman of Augusta National hardly looked like someone who felt threatened , even at the point of a bayonet . <p> As controversy over the all-male membership at the home of the Masters swirled well beyond its green gates , the 71-year-old Johnson was as defiant as ever . <p> The Masters will be played the second week in April , no matter what , he said , and there is no chance a woman will be a club member by then . <p> " We have no timetable on the woman member , " Johnson said during an hour-long interview Nov. 4 . " Our club has enjoyed a camaraderie and a closeness that 's served us well for so long , that it makes it difficult for us to consider change . <p> " A woman may be a member of this club one day , but that is out in the future . " <p> Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate with a three-page statement that defended the club 's right to privacy , and criticized Martha Burk and the National Council of Women 's Organizations for trying to coerce change . <p> He said in his July 9 letter that Augusta National may some day have a female member , " but not at the point of a bayonet , " which has become a slogan of his resolve . <p> Johnson spoke from his second-floor office , whose walls bear a photo of him and former chairman Clifford Roberts and an original portrait of Bobby Jones painted by President Eisenhower . <p> He was as unyielding as ever , offering the kind of assurances usually reserved for death , taxes and whether Tiger Woods has the game to contend for a fourth Masters title . <p> " There will always be a Masters , " he said . " We will prevail because we 're right . " <p> He was adamant in his stance that Augusta National would not cave in to the demands of Burk or anyone else who dares to challenge the constitutional rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This woman portrays us as being discriminatory and being bigots . And we 're not , " Johnson said . " We 're a private club . And private organizations are good . The Boy Scouts . The Girl Scouts . Junior League . Sororities . Fraternities . Are these immoral ? See , we are in good company as a single-gender organization . " <p> He sees no connection between racial and gender discrimination . <p> " Do you know of any constitutional lawyer that 's ever said they were the same ? Do you know any civil rights activists that said it was the same ? It 's not relevant , " he said . " Nobody accepts them as being the same . " <p> Burk does n't buy Johnson 's argument , and she speculated that he spoke out because , " He must be feeling additional pressure from inside the club , PGA Tour sponsors or the players . " <p> " I had sincerely and genuinely hoped it could be settled , and I still hope so , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there still may be some pressure outside the club to make this change . That might be the case , or he would n't have called this interview to make points he has made in the past . " <p> Augusta National opened in 1933 , the vision of Roberts , a Wall Street investment banker , and Bobby Jones , the greatest amateur ever . <p> The Masters was created in 1934 and has evolved into the most famous of golf 's four major championships , the only one played on the same course . <p> Johnson , a retired banker , was 4 when he attended his first Masters in 1935 . He was invited to join Augusta National in 1968 , and was elected chairman 30 years later . <p> He is said to have worked behind the scenes to get the first black admitted to the club in 1990 , shortly after the all-white membership controversy at Shoal Creek in Alabama . <p> Augusta National allows women to play its golf course without restrictions . Women played more than 1,000 rounds last year , and Johnson invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guest . <p> So , what 's wrong with having one as a member ? <p> " We just do n't choose to do that at this time , " he said . <p> Johnson said Burk 's letter has n't had any effect on the club 's decision to invite a woman to join . <p> Still , the chairman clearly is annoyed by Burk 's campaign . He never mentioned her by name , three times referring to her only as " this woman " or " that woman . " <p> Asked if he had any regrets about his response to Burk - three sentences vs. three pages to the media - Johnson smiled : " I seldom have any regrets . I do n't look back much . " <p> Then he turned serious and added : " I regret that she threatened us . And I regret that she threatened our sponsors . " <p> Johnson dismissed the only TV sponsors of the Masters - Citigroup , Coca-Cola and IBM - after Burk challenged them to live up to their own policies against sex discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which already gets the highest ratings among golf tournaments , the first commercial-free sporting event on network TV . <p> Can the Masters survive financially without sponsors for more than one year ? <p> " We could go indefinitely , " Johnson said . " But I do n't think we 'll have to . We 'll have our sponsors back . I just believe that we 're right on this issue , and that they 'll be comfortable in sponsoring the Masters Tournament . " <p> If some view this controversy as having the potential to mar the crown jewel of golf , Johnson certainly does n't . <p> " The majority of Americans are with us on this issue , " he said , leaning back in his leather chair . " I want you to know that . " <p> How can he be so sure ? <p> " I just know it , " Johnson said . " I know it by the response I get here . " <p> He reached for a letter and newspaper clipping on the coffee table , a poll from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to call in their vote on whether Augusta should admit women . Of 624 callers , 90 percent said no . <p> On his desk were four files , each one bulging with letters he said supported Augusta National and its rights as a private club . <p> Johnson said he has read and responded to each one . <p> " I do n't think we 've been damaged , " he said . <p> The only time Johnson 's voice was tinged with agitation was when he wondered why his club should be penalized " for presenting something that 's good for the game of golf ? " <p> " Something that 150 million watch around the world ? Something that 's a harbinger of spring ? Something that is respected worldwide ? We 're going to be penalized for that ? " <p> Burk has challenged several high-profile members of Augusta National to own up to their public stand against discrimination . <p> Lloyd Ward , CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee and one of only a half-dozen black members at Augusta , said he would work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chenault , another black member , also said he believed there should be female members . <p> That violates a cardinal rule at Augusta . The club traditionally speaks with one voice - Johnson 's . <p> " I 'm not going to talk about members , " he said , cutting off a question about comments from executives like Ward and Chenault . " We 'll handle that internally . " <p> Johnson did not appear to be concerned , nor did he think the debate would steal headlines from Woods going after a record third straight Masters title . <p> Meantime , Augusta National carries on behind the tall gates that seclude Magnolia Lane and its stately clubhouse from the rest of the world . <p> Several members played in a cool drizzle on this day , some of them taking along caddies dressed in the club 's traditional white coveralls . <p> Among the items for sale in the Augusta National pro shop was a navy blue cap with " 2003 Masters " stitched in white . Merchandise with a message .
