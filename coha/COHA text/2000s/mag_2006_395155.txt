Section : food &; nutrition appetites Now is the time to show up for your own life <p> When I first heard the Buddhist description of hungry ghosts  --  beings with stomachs as big as caves and throats as narrow as pins  --  I was positive I was going straight to hell as a hungry ghost . After all , this was an exact description of my experience with food . And not just with food , but also with life . <p> After years of being haunted by this image , I think I 've figured out what the hunger is about . It 's about missing my own life . It 's about having food ( both physical and emotional ) right there , and not being able to taste it because my attention is somewhere else . We 're all walking around hungry for an elusive something , and we 're missing the very thing that could fill us : showing up , being present in our own lives . <p> My friend James , a frequent curmudgeon and always successful businessman , recently told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting his foot and was actually aware of lifting it , he was completely happy . He said , " I know this sounds odd , but I feel the kind of happy I only thought I could be if the deal I am working on were to come through next week . I mean , the kind of happy that gives happiness its good name . " <p> James was talking about showing up for his own life , feeling alive . When he was aware of his everyday movements , he felt that all of him was living his life , instead of his mind being off planning his next meeting while his body was walking , riding in the car , or climbing stairs . James was talking about a quality that we already have because we are born with it . It is called presence  --  being ( body , mind , and soul ) where you are and feeling it . When You Are Elsewhere <p> Everyday , we open our eyes , get out of bed , eat breakfast , brush our teeth , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time , our minds are somewhere else . When we get out of bed , we are thinking about something we should have done yesterday ; when we talk to our children , we are thinking about the phone call we need to make ; when we walk to the bathroom , we are thinking about the chocolate we should n't have eaten . Or want to eat . Or are going to eat . Or how great our lives are going to be when we lose weight or get a promotion or fall in love . <p> We spend our lives , each day , in every moment , thinking about what we already did or are going to do , and we completely miss what we are doing . It 's like eating a fabulous meal while talking on the phone and watching TV . The meal ends and you have n't tasted a thing because your attention was elsewhere . <p> This lack of attention leads to a tremendous spiritual hunger that we ca n't quite name . We get fooled into thinking that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really something that is unfolding minute by minute , right in front of our eyes . We keep believing that if we go after the next big thing  --  the job , the car , the house , the perfect sweater  --  the hunger will be filled . And yet over and over we find that filling the hunger is n't about acquiring more things ; it 's about noticing what we already have and already are . Start with Your Legs <p> When I talk about presence in my classes , students give me suspicious stares . Some decide that they do n't like me and want their money back . Presence sounds dumb . " C'm on , Geneen . You make it sound so simple . What about my lousy relationship , or the fact that I have three kids under the age of 5 and not one second for myself the entire day ? How can I be present in my life as it is , if that life makes me unhappy ? " Good question , I say . And it is . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple . You start like James , by feeling alive in your arms and legs . The reason that living in your body is quite helpful is because the alternative  --  living in your mind  --  can drive you insane . There is no particular pattern to your thoughts ; in a split second , they zing crazily from the time you fell from your swing when you were 6 to what you are going to say to the person who insulted you yesterday . If you try to follow your thoughts , you get lost in fantasies , resentments , and anticipated disappointments . There is no ground , nothing solid to hold on to , no way of bringing yourself back to what you are doing now , this very second . You get to the end of a day  --  or the end of your life  --  and you wonder where you 've been . ( And the answer is : lost in thought ! ) <p> In the morning , before you get out of bed , focus your attention on your right foot , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , your arch . Then begin sensing your calf , your shin , your knees . Continue moving all the way up through your right hip , and then focus on your right hand , fingers , wrist , and elbow . When you get to the shoulder , move across to your left shoulder and down this arm to your hand ; then go from the left hip to the left foot . This should take about 5 minutes . <p> During the day , every time you remember , sense your arms and legs again , just for a few seconds . ( I do this about 100 times a day . ) This will help you land in your body and bring your mind back to the present moment ; it will give you a kind of mountain-solid feeling . <p> When you are present , nothing is missing . Time seems to stretch . And the reason it does is because it 's our thoughts  --  our crowded , worried minds  --  that make us feel so rushed . When you are present , a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Presence enables you to see that this body , your home , the place you 've spent years trying to change , is a pretty cool place to be . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Okay , arms , wake up now <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Geneen Roth <p> <p> Geneen Roth is the author of six books on emotional eating and a memoir , The Craggy Hole in My Heart and the Cat Who Fixed It . www.geneenroth.com <p>
