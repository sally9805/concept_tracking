<p> Readers of this column seem to love items on real estate and taxes . So this one on real estate taxes should be a real crowd pleaser . <p> After my recent columns on tracking the cost basis of stocks and funds , reader Stuart B. writes : <p> " With an Excel spreadsheet and a little diligence , keeping track of the cost basis of stocks and mutual funds is not that hard . More difficult is tracking the cost basis of one 's house . It is difficult sometimes to decide what is a capital improvement and what is maintenance . For example , we just replaced some double-hung windows in the living room . The old ones were 50 years old , not very tight , and without double-pane glass . The new ones are Marvin Tilt Pacs with all the latest technology . Thus the new windows are an improvement over the old , but might be regarded , at least in part , as age-related maintenance . Similar arguments can be made for landscaping . Perhaps you could do a column on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you sell a stock , house or other asset , your adjusted cost basis is subtracted from your sales proceeds to determine your capital gain or loss . <p> Basis starts with what you pay for an asset , but many things can increase or decrease it . For example , capital improvements can be added to basis , but repairs or maintenance can not . <p> If you sold a house before May 7 , 1997 , and deferred the capital gain , that gain reduces the cost basis in your existing house . <p> Single homeowners can exclude $250,000 in capital gains on the sale of a primary residence , and married couples filing jointly can exclude up to $500,000 , if they have owned and lived in the house for at least two of the previous five years ending on the date of sale . <p> Any profit over those limits is taxed at the capital gains rate , which tops out at 15 percent . <p> In the Bay Area , it does n't take long to surpass the exclusion limits , especially if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you can add to basis , the smaller your tax . <p> According to Internal Revenue Service Publication 523 , you can add to basis the cost of " additions and other improvements that have a useful life of more than one year . " Improvements are things that " add to the value of your home , prolong its useful life , or adapt it to new uses . " <p> Examples including " putting a recreation room or another bathroom in your unfinished basement , putting up a new fence , putting in new plumbing or wiring , putting on a new roof , or paving your unpaved driveway . " Adding a deck , sunroom or new garage are also improvements . <p> Improvements that are no longer part of the home can not be added to basis . For example , if you installed carpeting , then replaced it with wood floors , the carpeting is no longer part of your basis . Or if you plant a tree and it dies , the tree exits your cost basis . <p> On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not add to its value or prolong its life , " can not be added to basis , the IRS says . <p> Examples including repainting , fixing gutters or floors , repairing leaks or plastering and replacing broken window panes . However , repairs that are done as part of an extensive remodeling can be added to basis . <p> So how about those fancy Marvin windows ? <p> Michael Gray , a San Jose certified public accountant , says he would add them to cost basis . <p> IRS spokesman Jesse Weller says , " I ca n't give a specific yes or no answer because the law is not that specific . " It depends on " all the facts and circumstances . " <p> For example , " If all the windows in a home ( as opposed to one or two ) were upgraded and replaced from 50-year-old single paned windows to new double-paned windows costing $30,000 , the IRS would probably consider that expense a capital improvement rather than a repair . " <p> He adds , " If the new windows were done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit ( up to $200 total for windows ) , the credit amount claimed on the return would be subtracted from the costs that get added to basis . " <p> Weller says it 's important to keep records that document any expense that is added to cost basis . <p> When you sell a home , you can deduct from your sales proceeds commissions , advertising and legal fees and loan charges paid by the seller , such as loan placement fees or points . These deductions also reduce your capital gain . <p> Expenses to fix up a home for sale , such as a fresh coast of paint , can not be deducted from the sales proceeds , nor can they be added to basis , says Gray . <p> For rental properties , the cost basis rules are similar to those for residences . <p> However , " the rental owner does not have to wait until selling to benefit from the expense . The basis of rental improvements is capitalized and deducted through depreciation , usually over 27 1/2 years . Rental repairs are usually fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence repairs are not deductible , " Weller says . <p> Property taxes <p> If you already have a $250,000 profit in your house ( $500,000 if married ) , you may be tempted to sell it and buy another house so you can take advantage of the exclusion again . You can use the capital gains exclusion as often as every two years if you meet the other requirements . <p> In California , however , your property taxes could soar if you buy a house of equal or greater value . <p> Under Proposition 13 , your property is assessed on the date of purchase at fair market value , usually the purchase price . <p> The statewide tax rate is 1 percent of the assessed value . ( Local property taxes add to your bill . ) <p> After that , your assessed value ca n't go up by more than 2 percent a year . If you build an addition , its market value is added to your assessment , but the original property is not reassessed . <p> If you sell your house and buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the new , unless you meet exceptions approved under Propositions 60 , 90 or 110 . <p> If you or your spouse is 55 or older or if you are severely and permanently disabled , you can transfer your existing home 's assessed value  --  called base-year-value  --  to a replacement house , under certain conditions . <p> The replacement house must be of equal or lesser value than the first house , and it must be in the same county or in one of seven counties that accept transfers of base-year values . Those counties are Alameda , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Orange , Los Angeles , San Diego and Ventura . <p> You and your spouse can transfer your base-year value only once , with one exception . If you transfer your value once for age , you can do it a second time if you or your spouse subsequently becomes severely and permanently disabled and must move because of the disability . <p> The California Board of Equalization has written a new letter to county assessors answering many questions about base-year transfers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If someone gives or bequeaths you a house , what is your cost basis and base-year value ? <p> If you inherit a house , your basis is usually the home 's fair market value on the date of death . <p> If you get a house as a gift , there are two possibilities : <p> If the market value at the time of the gift is greater than donor 's adjusted basis , your basis is the donor 's adjusted basis . ( If the donor paid gift tax , the gift 's basis is increased by part of the gift tax . ) <p> If the market value at the time of the gift is less than donor 's adjusted basis , the calculation gets quite complicated . ( See IRS Publication 551 , Pages 8-9 . ) <p> As for property taxes , in California , a house is reassessed upon transfer , including by gift or inheritance , with a few exceptions . <p> If a primary residence is transferred  --  by gift or inheritance  --  between spouses , or between parents and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherit a house from your registered domestic partner , it wo n't be reassessed . <p> For more on intra-family transfers go to **48;6348;TOOLONG . <p> Additions to cost basis <p> Some improvements that can be added to the cost basis of a home : <p> Additions : bedroom , bathroom , deck , garage , porch , patio , sunroom . <p> Lawn &; grounds : landscaping , driveway , walkway , fence , retaining wall , sprinkler system , swimming pool . <p> Heating and cooling : heating system , central air conditioning , furnace , duct work , central humidifier , filtration system . <p> Plumbing : septic system , water heater , filtration or soft water system . <p> Interior : built-in appliances , kitchen modernization , flooring , carpeting . <p> Insulation : attic , walls , floor , pipes , ductwork . <p> Miscellaneous : storm windows or doors , new roof , central vacuum , wiring upgrades , satellite dish , security system . <p> Source : Internal Revenue Service Publication 523
