<p> A report showing outsize portfolio gains for US senators is raising new questions about ethics and conflicts of interest for Capitol Hill power brokers . <p> The study found that during the boom years of 1993-98 , a majority of US Senators were trading stocks - and beating the market by 12 percentage points a year on average . By comparison , corporate insiders beat the market by 5 percent , and typical households underperformed by 1.4 percent . <p> Financial experts interviewed for this story say the senators ' collective achievement is a statistical stunner , too big to be a mere coincidence . <p> That does n't mean lawmakers were consciously capitalizing on inside information , or that Martha Stewart-style prosecutions are around the corner . But the study is putting lawmaker finances in focus during an election year . And it is revealing a broader concern : Barricades against financial self-dealing in Congress are surprisingly thin . <p> Warding off conflicts of interest has long been a focus in the executiv branch . <p> But in America 's premier lawmaking body , few members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their investments in " blind trusts . " Unlike other federal employees , members of Congress are not required to recuse themselves when they have a financial interest in an issue they are legislating . And their required financial disclosure statements - which were used as the basis of the new study - are hardly as transparent as the public might expect . <p> " The public perception is that when a member has a stock in an industry he or she is regulating , there is a potential conflict of interest , " says Larry Noble , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington , which was not involved in the research . " When you add to it the higher rate of return in the new study , it raises the question of whether new rules are required to avoid the appearance that they have an advantage that the average investor does not have . " <p> To at least one individual with close knowledge of both investing and lawmaking , the notion of the Senate as a hotbed of day-trading is implausible . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shoulder and saying ' What 's hot ? ' " says Sen. Jon Corzine ( D ) of New Jersey , former chairman of Goldman Sachs . " If they were so interested in personal economics , you would think I would . I do n't find this group of senators even a tenth as interested in personal economics as in other walks of life I 've been in . " <p> The study , done by researchers from four universities , paints a few senators as heavy traders - but not the institution as a whole . During the 1990s years in question , 62 senators disclosed some 6,000 stock trades . Nearly half of those were reported by just four lawmakers : Claiborne Pell ( D ) of Rhode Island , John Warner ( R ) of Virginia , John Danforth ( R ) of Missouri , and Barbara Boxer ( D ) of California . The vast majority of purchase transactions are less than $ 15,000 . <p> Both the big traders and the small ones , in the statistical analysis , shared similar patterns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unclear whether the senators made trading decisions themselves . " If I 'm on that list , all the credit goes to my wife . She does all the stock transactions , " says Sen. Bob Graham ( D ) of Florida . <p> Of the four biggest traders , only Mr. Warner and Ms. Boxer remain in the Senate , and they did not return calls for this story . But neither Mr. Graham nor other senators who commented take even the hint of using public office for private gain lightly . <p> Ethics a resonant topic <p> Even in a town where a billion dollars changing hands in an election year barely raises a yawn from the public , the charge that lawmakers are profiting from a job in the public trust can sink a career . <p> In 1992 , 77 House members were defeated or retired after being named for writing bad checks in a House banking scandal . <p> The political fallout , including new ethics charges and countercharges , was so intense that members on both sides of the aisle agreed to disable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persists to this day . <p> Ethics complaints are handled discreetly in the clubby atmosphere of the US Senate . The Senate Ethics Committee does not even publish allegations of wrongdoing it may be investigating . The code of ethics is fairly general , and a committee of peers interprets those rules . <p> But in today 's highly partisan climate , personal portfolios are an increasingly large target , especially in the US Senate , where the net worth of senators has been rising rapidly . Senate majority leader Bill Frist drew criticism for his family 's financial interests in private hospitals during last year 's Medicare debate . Last month , Rep. Billy Tauzin withdrew from negotiations over a top lobby job for the pharmaceutical industry , because of the appearance of conflict of interest over his role in supporting industry interests in drafting the final Medicare bill . <p> " Public financial disclosure provides the mechanism for monitoring and deterring conflicts , " according to the Senate Ethics Manual . <p> But although the Senate 's financial disclosure rules have been upgraded over the years , records are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , researcher Alan Ziobrowski of Georgia State University says that without the help of former Sen. Max Cleland ( D ) of Georgia , he could not have afforded to pay for the data . <p> The documents are available to view in the public documents room of the Hart Senate Office Building or can be ordered at a cost of 20 cents a page . In addition , individuals who access these files find that their name , professional affiliation , and date of access become part of the permanent record of the file - so lawmakers can see who 's interested in them . " It can be intimidating , " Ziobrowski says . <p> Moreover , by law , the disclosures are removed from the public record after seven years . <p> " If public disclosure is the first line of defense , it has obviously failed , " says Thomas Ferguson , a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts , Boston . " These files were public in name only . It 's very hard to get this information . Note that it took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The data are incomplete : Dollar amounts are reported only in broad ranges : increments such as $ 50,00-100,000 , or " over $ 50 million . " The researchers were able to estimate performance by following stocks for a year before and after transactions . <p> " We have the date of the transaction , then watch the stock after that date in time . They had an uncanny ability to pick the right things on the right days , " says Mr. Ziobrowski . <p> " The behavior of common stocks purchased and sold by senators indicates that senators trade with a substantial informational advantage , " says Mr. Ziobrowski , a professor of finance at George State University . <p> He concedes that some senators may have " just been lucky " with their trades . The report will be published in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis in December . It finds no difference between the returns of Democrats and Republicans : <p> Not a random result <p> Financial analysts say it is highly unlikely that such returns could be random or simply the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it seems really unrealistic , " says Eugene Fama , a professor at the University of Chicago 's center for research in security prices . <p> Even more than corporate insiders , senators may have a broad knowledge of when things are going to come to pass . " They know people who run the companies , who are more than happy to see them whenever they want , " says Roger Ibbotson , chairman of Ibbotson Associates in Chicago and a professor at Yale School of Management . " No one refuses to take the call of a US senator . <p> He cautions that trades in the Ziobrowski study all occurred in the boom 1990s , and many were likely in high-flying dotcom stocks . It means that a similar pattern of unusually high returns might not have persisted . <p> Ziobrowski says he began this project nine years ago , after reading a report that 3 out of 4 members of Congress who traded stock had investments directly affected by their legislative activity . <p> Still , some senators go out of their way to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lugar ( R ) of Indiana says he sold all individual stocks in 1967 . Sen. Ben Nelson ( D ) of Nebraska says he invests mainly in government securities and CDs for the same reason . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
