<p> RIDGEWOOD , N.J. - Almost everyone has seen the famous study in black and white , one of those rare photographs that enters the collective memory as a snapshot not of a moment , but of an era and maybe something more . <p> At the front of a bus , where black people had never ridden before , is Rosa Parks , head slightly bowed , face turned to the window to her left , seemingly lost in thought as she rides through Montgomery , Ala . In the seat behind her , like the symbol of the old segregated order , is a young white man looking to his right , his face hard , almost expressionless . The two , the only figures visible on the bus , seem a few inches and a universe apart , each seemingly looking at and for something utterly different . <p> Everyone knows her . No one knows him . <p> Except for Catherine Chriss , his daughter . And , like his identity , unknown even to the veterans of that era still living , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and the white man is how much of what we think we know is what we read into the picture , not what 's there . <p> The man on the bus , Nicholas C. Chriss , was not some irritated Alabama segregationist preserved for history , but a reporter working at the time for United Press International out of Atlanta . He died of an aneurysm at the age of 62 in 1990 . Parks died at the age of 92 on Oct. 24 , a few weeks short of the 50th anniversary of her refusal to give up her seat on the bus to a white man . <p> Catherine Chriss , a journalist currently caring for her three young daughters , in November wrote a poem about the picture and the way her father became " the white man . The angry man . The one who looks like he 's a banker . But is n't . " <p> Over the past few years she 's been amazed at how ubiquitous the picture has become . <p> " It 's everywhere , " said Chriss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Apple used it in their campaign , Think Different . ' A friend called and said she saw the poster on the bus , the whole bus . It 's on the bus my daughter Alison takes to school now . When Alison was in second grade her classroom had that border with African-American heroes and leaders , and there 's the picture . She told her teacher that was her granddad up there . She did n't believe her . " <p> Nicholas Chriss , who also worked for the Los Angeles Times and the Houston Chronicle , publicly revealed his role in the picture just once . It was three paragraphs in the middle of an article he wrote for the Houston Chronicle in 1986 about his experiences covering the civil rights movement . <p> Memorable moment <p> He explained the picture was taken on Dec. 21 , 1956 , the day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Montgomery 's segregated bus system illegal . ( Actually the ruling had come a month earlier , but it was not until Dec. 20 that the district court entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he boarded the bus in downtown Montgomery , and he and Parks were the only riders up front . <p> He wrote : " It was a historic occasion . I was then with the United Press International wire service . A UPI photographer took a picture of Mrs. Parks on the bus . It shows a somber Mrs. Parks seated on the bus looking calmly out the window . Seated just behind her is a hard-eyed white man . Each anniversary of that day , this photograph is brought out of musty files and used in various publications around the world . But to this day no one has ever made clear that it was a reporter , I , covering this event and sitting behind Mrs. Parks , not some sullen white segregationist ! <p> " It was a great scoop for me , but Mrs. Parks had little to say . She seemed to want to savor the event alone . " <p> But his role in the picture was not included in his obituary , and interviews with almost a dozen veterans of that era - historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights attorney , Fred Gray , who represented Parks in court - did not turn up a single one who knew the man 's identity . <p> Still , if little known , the history of the picture is explored in one source , the biography of Rosa Parks by Douglas Brinkley , first published in 2000 as part of the Penguin Lives series of biographies . <p> Brinkley said Parks , in interviews with him , said she left her home at the Cleveland Courts housing project specifically for a picture of her on a bus and that the idea was for her to be seated in the front of the bus with a white man behind . Similar photo opportunities were arranged for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . and others during the day , he said . <p> Chriss then agreed to sit behind her for the purpose of the picture . Brinkley does not identify Chriss in the book and attributes the picture to a reporter for Look magazine and two photographers from Look . He said Parks told him she was reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and members of the civil rights community wanted an image that would dramatize what had occurred . <p> " It was completely a 100-percent staged event , " Brinkley said . " There was nothing random about it . " <p> But then the images and history of that era , so stark and powerful on their own , are seldom so simple . For starters , many people assume the famous picture of Parks captures the events of Dec. 1 , 1955 , when she refused to give up her seat on a packed bus to a white man . Not true . <p> The other famous images of her , a mug shot and a picture of her being fingerprinted , do n't date to Dec. 1 , 1955 , either . They were taken on Feb. 20 , 1956 , when about 100 Montgomery blacks were indicted for violating a local anti-boycott statute . <p> Parks was not the first black bus rider in Montgomery to refuse to give up her seat . Two other women , Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith , had done it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal challenge was based upon . The triumphant case from Montgomery that declared the city 's segregated bus system illegal was not based on her case , but on that of four other plaintiffs , including Colvin and Smith . <p> Known activist <p> And rather than a simple seamstress who dared to " Think Different , " Parks was a longtime NAACP activist , who went to the famous Highlander Folk School to learn about social change and lunched regularly with Gray , the civil rights attorney . <p> None of that lessens the achievement or her life , just as , perhaps , the true story of her picture with Chriss need not detract from its power . It 's just a reminder that history is almost always more complicated and surprising than the images that most effectively tell its story . <p> Gray , now 74 , says the picture reflects reality even if the moment it captures was n't entirely real . <p> " What it says is true , " he said , " that 381 days of walking had accomplished something historic so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seat , instead the white man was sitting behind her on the bus . It was staged , but I do n't think it inaccurately represented anything . " <p> In the end the reality of the picture may be a matter more for journalists than historians to ponder - staging a picture today without identifying the participants would be viewed as unethical , but it was more acceptable then . <p> Catherine Chriss said she thought her father 's identity should be known , not to give him a spot in history and certainly not to detract from the picture 's power , but because , in the end it tells what really happened in a picture that 's become a part of history in itself . <p> " I wanted people to know there was a story behind the man and a story behind the photograph , " she said . " I do n't think he 'd care about being known . It 's not a photo about him . But it makes me proud to know he was a big part of history . Without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes everyone up to the changes in our history . " ASSOCIATED PRESS MONTGOMERY ADVERTISER
