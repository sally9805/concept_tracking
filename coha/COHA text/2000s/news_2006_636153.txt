<p> ST . PAUL , Minn.  --  When a cold wind blows over the prairie , there is a place where hearts are warm and comforts are cozy . The port is Mickey 's Diner . The diner has been a St. Paul icon since 1939 when it arrived like a friendly hobo on a railcar from New Jersey . <p> Mickey 's is featured in the hit film " A Prairie Home Companion , " based on the radio show taped one block east of the diner and one block north at the Fitzgerald Theater , 10 E. Exchange St. <p> Mickey 's , West Seventh and St. Peter , has been unique since the day it was born . <p> The prefabricated porcelain diner with plate glass windows was built to look like an old railroad car by the Jerry O'Mahony Co. , but in truth Mickey 's was one of the first Art Deco diners . Previous diners had been white , where Mickey 's has a bright red and cream streamline design . The menu still has 1960s type items like Mickey 's Sputnik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dressing and melted cheese ; $4.90 ) and Mulligan Stew , made from scratch with carrots , beef , celery , onions , tomatoes and grilled Texas Toast on the side ( $5.70 ) . The diner 's Seeburg Wall-O-Matic jukeboxes no longer work , but if they did you would be hearing Perry Como 's 1958 smash " Magic Moments . " <p> Movie-related tourism is a growing business and Mickey 's is no exception . The 24-hour diner has been busy this summer . Mickey 's also has been featured in Arnold Schwarzenegger 's " Jingle All The Way " and " The Mighty Ducks " trilogy . Mickey 's was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and at the time was one of only two diners to receive such designation . <p> Mickey 's owner-operator Melissa Mattson conducted a 1999 survey that revealed nearly 5 percent of her customers were attracted by the Hollywood connection . Mattson is the granddaughter of Swedish immigrant John " Bert " Mattson , who co-founded the operation with David " Mickey " Crimmins . <p> " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " Mattson said during a recent Saturday afternoon conversation at Mickey 's . She now operates the diner with her brother Bert . " My grandfather and Mickey were business partners , " said Mattson , 39 . " They went to the national restaurant convention in Chicago . The O'Mahony company had a booth promoting diners and all the stats on how to deliver them . " She nodded to an empty space and said , " This diner was delivered with a cigarette machine and they even broke down how much you could make based on how many cigarettes you sold in a month . " A June 1922 monthly statement from one of the O'Mahony standard cars promised a $69.52 gross profit on tobacco . Those were different times . Mickey 's is now a non-smoking diner as are all bars and restaurants in St. Paul . But Mickey 's still has a public telephone , which is good news for cell-free people like myself . <p> O'Mahony was based in Elizabeth , N.J.  --  the boyhood home of crime writer Mickey Spillane . O'Mahony also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular Aspen Motel in Manchester , Vt. , and the stainless steel Yakkitty-Yak Diner in North Apollo , Pa . <p> " Mickey 's is one of the few diners still standing in the state of Minnesota , " said Daniel Zilka , acting director of the American Diner Museum in Providence , R.I. " That 's part of its importance . " <p> Mattson and her brother often find it difficult to find the parts to keep the diner chugging . The diner is open 365 days a year . " This was built to be efficient , " she explained . " The grill . The deep fryer , everything has to be a certain specification . You do n't have the room to change anything . My father has an attachment to all of the older cash registers . " Mattson pointed out a clunky , remedial cash register affixed with a black Johnny Cash bumper sticker and said , " That does n't go back to 1939 , but it goes back to 1960 . There was one man in town who knew how to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our own . You encounter things like that when there are things you want to keep traditional . " <p> I stayed in a hotel a few blocks away from Mickey 's . Late on a Friday night I walked over to Mickey 's to take a three-scooped , hand-dipped raspberry shake ( $4.50 ) back to my digs and write a bit before going to bed . But I learned that Mickey 's has a no-carry out policy . " We try to get everybody in and out as quickly as possible , " Mattson explained . " When the diner fills up , carry out people have to wait so long . We were never designed for that . " <p> " A Prairie Home Companion " director Robert Altman filmed his scenes at the diner last July . " We put some food out and you 'll notice in the film there 's some extras at the end of the counter , " she said . " But we served them mostly coffee . Garrison Keillor and Robert Altman came in a couple times beforehand for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streep and Woody Harrelson all came in . When they were filming at Fitzgerald 's , the cast and crew were coming in pretty regularly . " The diner 's peak times are Friday and Saturday nights and Saturday and Sunday mornings . Like all great diners , Mickey 's is known for its kick ass coffee ( $1.65 ) , roasted in St. Paul and ground on the premises . The diner also serves bean soup with liberal doses of diced ham hock ( $2.15 a bowl ) from a Navy recipe that Bert Mattson brought back from World War II . <p> Mattson grew up in the diner . She began working at Mickey 's at age 15 behind a cook named Rose , who was hired by her grandfather . " I 'd work behind her because they needed somebody really small , " she said with a laugh . Mickey 's only has four booths . Most regulars sit at the 17 swivel stools along the diner counter . The entire diner holds 36 people . <p> Mattson looked out the diner window as dark clouds formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much stayed the same since I was 15 , but everything around us has changed . We used to have the 24-hour Greyhound bus depot across the street and now we have the Children 's Museum , " she said . " As was the case with most cities during the ' 70s there was an urban decline and everyone was moving to the suburbs . So clientele has changed a lot . " <p> Ironically , the premise of the " Prairie Home Companion " film is that the performers have gathered at the Fitzgerald for the last time as the theater is being torn down to make way for a parking lot . <p> Besides the " Prairie Home " companions , other famous diners at Mickey 's include Cubs fan Bill Murray , co-owner of the St. Paul Saints baseball team ; Roseanne Barr , and Liv Tyler . " About 10 years ago , Julio Iglesias got down on his knee and serenaded ' To All the Girls I 've Loved Before ' to one of our waitresses , " Mattson said . " Then my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his concert . <p> But to really get the scoop , you have to bug Paul Jirasek . He can be found in his regular spot at the far east end of the counter . Jirasek has been coming to Mickey 's for 22 years . He likes his spot because he can look out on the street to see what is going on . " I moved to St. Paul in 1984 , " he said over a cup of coffee . I wondered where he moved from . He answered , " Across the river in Minneapolis . " <p> Oh . <p> Jirasek is retired after teaching 20th century British and American literature at the University of Minnesota . He looked like a retired Prince Valiant in brown saddle shoes . Jirasek dines at Mickey 's four or five times a week . He probably lives alone but you do n't ask those questions in a small diner . <p> " It 's all good , " said Jirasek , who does reside three blocks from the diner . " What I generally order is a quarter-pound bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickey 's has a huge following . This is a very traditional place . " <p> It has begun to rain outside of Jirasek 's favorite window , but there is calm over his coffee . He can count on that . That 's why people keep coming back to Mickey 's Diner . <p> Mickey 's Diner is at 36 W. 7th St. ( 651-222-5633 ) .
