<p> NEW YORK  --  For a short while , Sharon Booker hoped for the impossible . <p> Her husband , Sean Booker , was in the north tower of the World Trade Center the morning of Sept. 11 last year . He was among the thousands missing , believed to be dead . But there was no body . No proof . And she was getting letters from lawyers saying her missing husband had been in North Carolina eight months after the terrorist attacks and received a traffic ticket . Maybe , she thought , he was alive after all . <p> " We were just told that our loved one disappeared , " says Sharon Booker , 38 , who lives in New Jersey . " And then out of the blue . . . I get this letter . It was very shocking . " <p> But it was not to be . In the first known case of identity theft involving a victim of the World Trade Center attack , a Guyanese immigrant has been arrested after allegedly using Sean Booker 's name . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and law enforcement officials feared there might be a rash of identity thefts . Although the case involving Sean Booker 's identity is the first to come to light , experts warn that it 's probably not the last . <p> Treasure trove for thieves <p> " Are there other cases ? Probably , " says Linda Foley , executive director of the San Diego-based Identity Theft Resource Center . " Unfortunately , they do n't come to light until . . . somebody slips up , and it comes to the attention of the authorities or a family member . " <p> Identity theft is a growing problem , but this incident was particularly shocking to law enforcement officials because it involved a victim of 9/11 . The large amount of personal information posted on Web sites by those searching for loved ones , as well as the numerous articles written about the missing , provided a treasure trove for identity thieves , experts say . Drivers ' licenses and other personal items were also strewn in the debris and may have been picked up by scavengers . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Trade Center . Some of the thousands of pieces of paper that fluttered into the streets may have contained confidential information from those companies . <p> The Identity Theft Resource Center and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , a consumer advocacy group , issued an advisory shortly after the attacks to warn people who did business with those companies to consider notifying credit agencies to make sure no accounts in their names were opened without permission . <p> " We anticipated problems , " Foley says . Other types of fraud that surfaced after Sept. 11 " told us very quickly that people were going to prey on the tragedy for personal financial gain . If I was an identity thief , I would have been on the first plane or first train to New York and would have been walking up and down those streets . " <p> Identity theft is broadly defined as using someone else 's private information for personal gain . Someone 's name and Social Security number can be used to set up a line of credit or to create a false identity as a shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to spend years clearing up debt they did not incur or clearing their names of wrongdoing they did not commit . <p> It 's difficult to get a total tally of identity theft cases , partly because they are not always separated from other fraud charges . But according to the Federal Trade Commission , which takes consumer complaints about identity theft , there were 86,168 victims last year . In 2000 , there were 31,113 . <p> Traffic accident led to arrest <p> Leslie Patrick Cumberbatch was arrested in Manhattan on Oct. 24 . He faces federal charges of illegally re-entering the USA after being deported in 1998 . But Cumberbatch 's alleged use of a driver 's license with Sean Booker 's name led to his arrest . <p> " Actually , I think that was probably his biggest mistake , the fact that he brought so much attention to himself by using someone 's identity from the World Trade Center , " says Marc Berlin of New Jersey 's major financial crimes unit . <p> On May 5 , Cumberbatch was driving a 15-passenger rental van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor accident and was given a $ 90 ticket for failure to yield , says Lt. Carl Benson of the Tarboro Police Department . <p> Police discovered later that the license Cumberbatch showed had his picture but bore Booker 's name , address , license number and birth date . A few days after the traffic accident , Booker 's widow received several solicitations addressed to her husband offering legal assistance . <p> " At first I was just going to disregard it and say it was a mistake , " she says of the letters . " I tore up a couple of them . But something in my heart said call one ( lawyer ) and find out what this is about . " <p> Sharon Booker eventually got in touch with Benson of the Tarboro police . He asked an officer who had been at the accident scene to look at a picture of her husband posted on the Internet with other World Trade Center victims . The officer said that was not the man driving the van . <p> Benson soon began working with Berlin in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been doing this 25 years , " Benson says about his police work . " I take few things personally . But for somebody to do that to the survivor of a World Trade Center victim , it 's particularly despicable . " <p> Interviews with people in North Carolina led to information about the driver 's children . A search of their birth records helped Berlin find Cumberbatch 's real name . He also discovered that Cumberbatch had been convicted in 1996 for possession of marijuana . Cumberbatch was sentenced to 33 months and was deported to Guyana in 1998 , according to the federal complaint that outlines the current charge against him . <p> The Immigration and Naturalization Service was contacted , and officials eventually arrested Cumberbatch  --  5 1/2 months after the accident . If convicted of illegally re-entering the USA , he could receive up to 20 years . <p> Easy crime to commit <p> Authorities are not sure how Cumberbatch learned about Booker . But identity theft is relatively easy to commit , says Jan Gilhooly of the U.S. Secret Service in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple act of taking someone else 's name is difficult to trace . " Information can be taken in Seattle or overseas , " Gilhooly says , " sent by e-mail to another city , and then generated by computer e-mail to another city , where total sets of identification can be made and used in crimes in other cities . " <p> Sean Booker , 35 , was a minister who also worked for Xerox servicing the printers at Marsh &; McLennan , an insurance company on the 93rd floor of the north tower . He brought his ministry to work , leading a morning prayer group of his fellow employees . His family believes that is what he was doing when a jet struck the building . <p> Sharon Booker is glad her husband has his name back . But as she raises the couple 's 6-year-old son and 4-year-old twin son and daughter , she can not help but wonder , " What if ? " <p> " Part of me did believe it could have been him , " she says . She remembers the day Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a relief , but yet I 'm back to knowing that Sean is really gone . " <p> And if her husband 's remains had not been identified in September , a year after the towers collapsed , " that would have been something that was always on my mind . I would have thought he was somewhere out there . "
