ON THE DAY HENRY MCVANE bought his flintlock , most of us in New Hope either shrugged our shoulders or laughed out loud . He actually paid cash money for the thing . Henry went to Springfield with $10 in his pocket to buy a new colter for his plow and came back with a musket . His wife , Emma , nearly took a meat cleaver to him . <p> " Ten dollars ! " she wailed to anyone who would listen at Sunday services . " We ca n't even buy feed for the chickens and he spends ten dollars on a gun ! " <p> But then Henry always was an odd sort of fellow . Real nice , but odd . Like the time a coyote raided his chickens . The next night , Henry hid in the coup and spent all night howling , the idea being to lure the coyote back and then bash it with a hammer . That coyote is probably still laughing its head off . <p> After services , some of us gathered around and asked Henry why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his hay-colored hair and habit of balancing himself on the sides of his boots , he looked like a kid caught stealing his father 's tobacco . <p> He just shrugged his bony shoulders and said , " You never know when Indians might attack the town . " <p> We all looked at each other . " What Indians ? " Charles Wooster asked . <p> Henry shrugged his shoulders again . A week later he took Charles and Daniel Fry and me up to Glory Falls to demonstrate the usefulness of his flintlock . He took his time explaining how he measured out the precise amount of powder and poured it into the priming pan and he held up the ball between his fingers as if he were holding up a jewel to the light . Then he dropped it down the barrel and rammed it home and we started stalking . <p> Soon enough , a doe wandered between two beech trees . We stopped dead in our tracks . Henry lifted the musket and sighted down the barrel . Now my father told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't enough muskets to go around , not that it mattered . The officers told them not to aim since that just wastes time and you never hit what you aim at anyway . just shoot and charge . But try telling that to Henry . He took his time aiming , then slowly pulled the trigger . The gun went off like a thunder clap and so many sparks flew from the flint that one burned Dan Fry 's cheek . The ball whizzed over the doe 's startled head to knock some leaves from their branches and the doe fled for its life . So did every bird , squirrel , rabbit , raccoon , and gray fox within miles . By the time Henry managed to reload , we were the only living things in the woods . <p> After that , Henry put his musket in his tool shed and pretty much forgot about it until the creature came to New Hope . <p> Living in the shadow of Downy Mount , we naturally collected our share of tall tales the way trees gather moss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave at the full moon and hunted down folks who stayed away from church . Then there was the Algonquian burial ground where ghosts did a war dance and went out seeking scalps . The most feared creature was Dorinda the witch , feared because she actually lived in a shack above Glory Falls and sold herb remedies and cast spells for folks . Dorinda was n't a witch , just a crazy whore . Even as a child , Dorinda was strange , talking to herself in some made-up language , disappearing at night into the woods , making sparrows land on her arms by singing to them . The real trouble started when her time came and her breasts started to swell and she 'd walk along the plank streets of New Hope and grin at all the men and rub her hands all over her chest . That 's the real reason she was run out of town when she was fourteen . Still , all the women who despised her were n't above sneaking up to her place to get a charm to help them get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while none of us ever said it out loud , we knew some of the men went up there at nights to trade corn meal or a bolt of cloth for a taste of her body . There were hot nights when I 'd gaze at Downy Mount and find myself thinking of Dorinda and wonder how different she might be from my Rachel . I resisted , but the temptation returned now and again like a bad dream . <p> So we had our stories about demons and monsters to make long nights seem shorter . The creature I 'm talking about came during the drought of ' 05 . Spring came early , the sky dried out , the heat settled over Massachusetts like a plague . Our soy beans and corn never stood a chance . Many of us lived on chickens and pigs and anything we could buy in Springfield , which was n't much . Nothing makes a man feel as lonely and powerless as the weather . I remember standing at the edge of my bean field and staring at the dry and cracked ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shrinking until my manhood was as useless and shriveled as the bean stalks . The sky was the color of pale ice only it was n't cold ; it was hot enough to make me think I had a fever all summer long . Three pigs out of my seven died so lean we could n't even butcher them . And there was n't a damn thing I could do about it . My Rachel and the children were scared . I felt like a failure and as much as I hate to admit it now , I found myself wishing they were already dead just so I could stop feeling like I failed them . Just one night of peace . That 's all . Then I burned with shame and tried to force the thoughts from my soul . <p> I went into the house and balanced Colin and Samuel on my knees , hugging them all the while . Rebecca toddled up with her puppet . I kissed her cheek , then showed the children how to make cat 's cradles . After I put them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned her around . She stood at the table , collecting potato skins for the pigs . She smelled of earth and harsh soap . Her pale eyes searched mine . <p> " It 's bound to rain sooner or later , " I said . <p> She nodded , but bit her lip . " We always get by , " she said . <p> " Yes , we do , " I said and pressed my lips to hers , then hugged her so suddenly she gasped . " I love you , " I said to drive away my fears . <p> She nodded into my chest , then pulled away to resume her work on the potato skins . <p> " Come to bed , " I said . <p> Rachel shook her head . " I ca n't , Lucas , " she said . " It 's my time . " I thought I heard a note of relief in her voice . I turned away before a sudden surge of anger made me say something I 'd regret . <p> In the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the church . Something evil happened , they said . We got troubles . <p> Many of us heeded the call along with a gathering of town folk . Dan Fry stood before the lectern , his face the color of a mushroom , and told his story . <p> " I heard a pig squealing last night , " he said . " So I went out thinking coyotes were raiding the farm . Then I saw it . At first I thought it was some child because it was kinds small and hunched over . I took after it , but it looked up and so help me Lord Jesus it was the worst demon face you can think of . It looked like something already dead and buried and it had fangs and horrible eyes . And blood was all over it because it was eating a pig . Live ! Did n't even kill the thing before it started eating the insides . You got to believe me . When it saw me it stood up and it was taller than me . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got scared and run off . " <p> If it had been anyone else , we might have laughed . But Dan Fry was a strapping , level-headed sort . He had no more imagination than the mountains had fancy cities . I wondered if he had been making corn liquor or maybe the heat finally got to him . I looked back into his eyes and I saw terror in them . <p> I sat next to Henry McVane and afterward I asked him what he thought . Henry considered the story , then shrugged . " This drought 's so bad , maybe something got stirred up and came down looking for food . " <p> " So you believe him ? " I asked . <p> " Maybe yes , maybe no . Thing is , there 's lots of hidey holes and caves and things up there . How do we know what lives up there and stays clear of us most of the time ? What do you think , Lucas ? " <p> I climbed into my wagon and gazed at Downy Mount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smear on a window pane . Maybe it was the heat , but my mind wandered to crazy Dorinda in her shack by the cool waters of the river and what it might be like to feel her thighs around my waist , to just take a woman and never worry whether she had enough to eat . I shook the thoughts away and said , " I do n't know , Henry . just in case , you ought to clean the rust off your musket . " <p> Henry cocked his head and considered the idea . <p> " But if you see it , do n't bother to aim , " I laughed . <p> Henry smiled ruefully and walked away . <p> The next night , the thing returned and got Sam Lerner 's chickens . The night after that , Sarah Ernest had a conniption fit when she saw it staring through her window . Saturday night , riders summoned us again to the church . This time Charles Wooster stood before us , his gaunt body still as rock , his jaw quivering from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " My Robert is gone . " <p> The church fell as quiet as a tomb . <p> Pastor Stevens said , " He 's out playing . " <p> " Fishing , " someone said . <p> " No need to fuss . " <p> Charles leveled his gaze at us , ready to go for someone 's throat . " It took him . I know it took him . I saw its tracks . Help me . Please ! " <p> The tomb sealed itself . Charles and Anne had only the one child and it was n't even his own . They never talked much about it , but everyone said Anne was barren . Then one day Charles goes off and comes back with his brother 's baby because his brother died of the flu . Even though Robert was n't his real son , Charles and Anne cared for him and loved him like the best parents in the world and raised him to be as fine a boy as any in New Hope . You ca n't hear about someone losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach big enough to swallow your heart . <p> At last I ventured , " Charles , we do n't know there 's any monster running around here . " <p> Charles glared at me . I stared at my boots and wished I had the sense to keep my mouth shut . <p> " Please ! " Charles wailed . <p> So there we all sat in the dim windowless church , no one speaking , all thinking the same thing . We were scared of the creature just like we were scared of the drought . We were powerless to make it rain . We were powerless to help Charles . No , not powerless . Cowards . <p> Then the voice of God saved us by speaking through Pastor Stevens . " Does n't that Henry McVane have a musket ? " <p> Yes , of course . Henry ! Make Henry do it ! As if we were all the separate heads of one giant monster , we turned and looked at Henry McVane in the last row . Henry turned the color of whitewash . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man said . <p> " Charles 's boy ! " Sarah Ernest cried . " We got to save him ! " <p> Charles stared as if Henry was already up on the wall nailed to the cross . <p> At that moment , my face burned red and the heat built under my shirt and I felt as if I would throw up . My shame took hold of me like someone possessed by the devil . How could I ever take hold of my Rachel and make love to her again , knowing I was n't a man at all , but a coward , and hearing that relief in her voice that meant she also knew I was a coward ? How could I look my own boys in the face ? I felt like my soul left my body and hovered in the rafters and watched someone else speak . " I 'll go with you , Henry , " my body said . <p> Henry nodded at me and swallowed . Fingers took mine , Rachel 's touch bringing me back to my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodded . " I love you , " she said . Her voice broke . <p> " I love you , " I said and gripped her hand . <p> " Bring their boy back safe , Lucas , " she said . I wondered if she wanted me to go , to not come back , to be rid of me . But that was foolish . <p> Pastor Stevens began a prayer of deliverance . <p> WHICH IS HOW HENRY and Charles and I returned to Glory Falls with Henry 's musket and knives and Sam Lerner 's dog Cornwall . The skinny yellow mutt caught a scent at Charles 's farm , took off quartering the fields , then headed through the oaks to the ridge . We climbed after Cornwall and soon ascended Downy Mount . Charles and Henry and I stayed silent and grim . Even a field of blooming mountain laurels could n't cheer us . Farther up , the rhododendrons , usually taller than a man and blooming and dripping moisture , looked stunted and dry , leaves yellowing and curling in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . <p> At Glory Falls , Cornwall lost the scent in the river . Again I 'm ashamed to admit it , but I felt my heart leap when Cornwall lost the scent and stared pathetically at us . We tried . We could go home now and hold our heads up . <p> Charles clenched his fists and glared at the pine and beech-coated mountains . Henry fingered his flintlock and held it across his chest like a shield . Haze from the heat hung across the mountains ; even this high up the infernal heat killed all sound , all movement of paws and wings . If a geyser of flames had spewed from the river , announcing the entryway to Hell , I would not have been surprised . <p> Again my face burned . Even though my legs shook and I had to fight with my own body to stop myself from pissing in my pants , I said , " If it came this way , only one place it might head . " I pointed beyond the falls to the peak of Downy Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once . " <p> Charles whirled on me , bit his lip and gave a curt nod . " We 'll try it . " <p> He tied a rope leash to Cornwall and we climbed the slick rocks next to the falls . At the top , I took the dog and the lead , guiding the way to my own funeral . <p> We all knew we 'd never make it back down before nightfall . We kept our fear to ourselves , put one foot in front of another and climbed into the suffocating haze . <p> A new thought stopped me in my tracks . " Dorinda , " I said . <p> Charles and Henry stared at me as if I had started talking in tongues . <p> " Dorinda , " I said . " Her shack 's near here . " <p> " So what ? " Charles said . " She 's crazy . " <p> " Yeah , but she lives up here . She might have seen something . " <p> " I 'm not wasting daylight going anywhere near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery long ago . " <p> " But if it came this way .... " <p> " I said no ! " Charles screamed . Henry and I took a step backward and Cornwall tucked his tail between his legs . <p> None of us wanted to confront Dorinda , even be close enough to smell her unwashed flesh , but Charles 's rage went beyond fear . Then he sighed and slumped his shoulders and he said , " All right . We 'll go . " <p> We set off to the east through the pines until we came again to the northern banks of the river . Across the river , pines and birch trees towered over Dorinda 's pathetic shack . If you did n't know to look for it , you might think the shack was just a pile of dead logs . We walked upstream until we could ford the river , then walked back to the shack . <p> Fungus grew on the logs . An old sheet billowed in the window . Underbrush advanced on the cabin like an invading army and weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarmed around the logs ; that was the odd part . The white flower of bloodroot only blooms in the spring . Where even the rhododendrons wilted and died , the bloodroot flowers flourished in the hot summer . <p> We called Dorinda 's name . Silence . Called again . Not even the wind stirred in answer . <p> " Let me handle her , " Charles said and marched to the door and pounded on it . He put his shoulder to the planks and shoved . Charles stood in the doorway with his back to us , as still as a grave marker . Then he said , " My sweet Lord Jesus . " <p> Cornwall refused to move , hunkered down with his face in his paws . Henry and I walked to the door and peered around Charles 's shoulders . For a moment , I could see nothing in the gloom . When my eyes adjusted , I wished I had never looked . First I saw Dorinda , or what was left of her . She looked like a corn husk tossed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her sickly gray face . I looked away and saw the rest . Dead chickens littered the floor and dried blood stained the dirt floor around a big cast iron pot . All over the walls , Dorinda , or someone , had painted weird drawings , things that looked like hex signs . The symbols had been painted in blood . I smelled the foul stench of rotting meat . <p> We three turned away and stumbled into the fresh air . For long minutes we said nothing . At last Henry whispered , " It got her too . " <p> Charles said , " That stuff . Looked like some witch thing . Like casting a spell . " <p> " Maybe Dorinda conjured the thing , " I said . " Maybe it was too much and it took her . " I touched Charles 's shoulder . " You know I got to go back in there . " <p> Charles nodded and stared at the dirt . I turned and stepped over the brush until I reached the door . I made sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but went instead to the cauldron . Whatever she had cooked up now only caked the bottom like a dried swamp with the trees of chicken bones poking through the muck . I hunted , touched what I dared , but found no sign of Robert Wooster 's body . Only chickens and Dorinda had been slaughtered . I was about to leave when I caught sight of a puppet leaning in a comer . For a moment , I no longer stood in Dorinda 's shack , but walked the plank streets of New Hope and saw a child dancing toward me , that same puppet clasped to her chest . She stopped and held up the puppet and sang , " Want to play at puppets with me ? " Her voice was the sound of wind chimes and I wanted desperately to say yes , but my mother told me Dorinda was evil and so I shook my head , but as she skipped away I followed her to a glade behind the market and watched her dance and spin and sing in a cloud of butterflies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing , a strange nameless yearning that sent the blood pulsing at my temples and a feverish wave rushing through my brain . She was the most beautiful person I had ever seen , and her dance was a free-spirited and loose-limbed dance of freedom . Years later I again passed Dorinda in the streets , only this time I was becoming a man and her insolent grin and the thrust of her breasts against her dress sent my blood rushing to my loins . I turned before she saw me and fled . Pastor Stevens said thinking bad things is the same as doing bad things . If that was true then I was damned , or at least I thought so back then . All these years later , that same childhood puppet watched me from button eyes and I felt not damned , but remorseful . We had all done evil to Dorinda . I wished I could go back and do it all over again . I crossed myself and muttered the Lord 's Prayer for her and left , keeping my back to what remained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Charles . " Or her blood . No sign of Robert . " <p> Charles set his jaw and said , " Let 's go . " <p> We hurried away from Dorinda 's shack and the nightmare vision , chased by the demons of our own fears . <p> Dusk coated the mountain like fog by the time we reached the summit . I led them around an outcropping and we reached the cave , actually little more than a fissure in the granite wall . Charles peered inside , but could see nothing . Since none of us wanted to chance the mountain in the dark , we were pretty much stuck there for the night . We built a fire at the cave entrance and between the fire and a torch we could see most of the cave . It was just rock walls and dirt . <p> I had been so sure . <p> " There ! " Henry yelped . <p> He held the torch close to the wall ; lines ran down the side , scratched into the rock . At first I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit me . Something had scratched the wall with claws from roof to floor , large sharp talons , nothing a bear or anything else could have made . <p> " It 's been here , " Henry said . <p> " So it 'll come back , " Charles said . <p> " It 's like it left us a sign , " I whispered . <p> We retreated to the warmth and the light of the fire . <p> For much of that night , Charles paced the circle of light like a guard protecting the walls of a fort . Henry busied himself cleaning his flintlock , blowing dirt out of the priming pan and filling it with powder . <p> " Think we 'll find Robert ? " he asked when Charles was out of earshot . <p> I shrugged my shoulders . <p> " You think , if Dorinda conjured this demon , a gun could hurt it ? " Henry asked . <p> I wished he had n't brought that up . " Do n't think we 'll sleep much tonight , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wall , " Henry said . " If something comes at us , we got nowhere to run . " <p> " Henry , " I said . " You want to stop thinking so much . It 'll get you in trouble . " <p> " I 'm just saying . " <p> " How about saying something else ? " I said . <p> Henry pouted and cradled his musket . <p> Of course , once he opened his mouth , I could n't help staring into the darkness beyond the fire and waiting for some shape to come up the rise and eat us alive . The moon filtered through the leaves , turning the woods into a quilt of silver and black . <p> It was like standing at the edge of my fields and watching the soybeans die , listening to the pigs whine in pain and hunger , dreading the look in my Rachel 's eyes . <p> " I do n't want to die , " Henry said . <p> " Stop it , " I said . <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he whispered . <p> " I 'm not Pastor Stevens , " I said . <p> " I saw her once , " he said . " Dorinda . She was out in a field of laurel and she was dancing . I came up on her and there she was twirling around and singing to herself , just so innocent like , happy and all . I just watched her like it was a dream . Then she spotted me and she smiled and she lay down in the laurel and hiked up her skirts and waited for me . " <p> He shut up and I could only nod my head and say , " It 's natural , Henry . " <p> " I sinned , " Henry said . " Lord Jesus forgive me . " <p> " I sinned , " Henry said . " Lord Jesus forgive me . " <p> " He forgives you , " I said even though I was n't convinced . If Henry sinned , he had plenty of company . If death lurked on that mountain , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ? I could n't think that way no matter what people said . I was just scared of dying because afterward there might be nothing . <p> " You get some sleep , " I said . " I 'll stand guard . " <p> Despite my determination to stand guard , I dozed and fell into dreams of pigs eaten alive . Henry fell asleep , leaning on his musket . We both jerked awake to stare into each other 's terrified eyes . Cornwall barked furiously and down the bluff , Charles screamed again . <p> I reached him first , stumbling to a halt and throwing out my arm to stop Henry 's mad charge . Henry made a sound like a stuck pig . I probably did the same . <p> The thing loomed in a patch of moonlight and held Charles tight to its chest with one arm while it stroked his head with long dirty talons like a loving eagle from hell . Its face was a skull imperfectly worked from clay ; one moment it was a skull , the next the hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It heard us and looked up , then grinned , exposing teeth as jagged as a saw blade . More than anything , that grin seized me to the bowels and made me want to run screaming home . It was a demon grin , the mad humorless expression of a creature ready to drag us to damnation . <p> But I saw something else in that face , a hint , a memory , a shadow more awful than the face itself . <p> " You leave him be , Dorinda , " I said . <p> The creature stopped petting Charles and its grin went wider . " It 's clever , is n't it ? Yes it is so clever . " <p> Cornwall leaped and fretted and barked at the creature , the fur on its hackles rising above his spine . " Come here doggy , " the demon said . " I need my dinner . " <p> " You shape-changed , did n't you ? " I said . " You left your old body like a snake shedding its skin . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come to me and let me stroke your black hair . " <p> Cornwall charged . As if stomping on an ant , the creature lashed out with a taloned foot . Cornwall leaped away and backpedaled , snarling all the time . <p> Charles was as pale as marble , could do nothing but stand still in Dorinda 's savage embrace . Henry eased next to me , flintlock raised , his hands shaking and turning the barrel into a pinwheel in the night . He yearned to blow a hole clean through the monster . Thank God he remembered the doe , thought twice unless he accidentally put the ball through Charles 's face . <p> Dorinda looked down at Charles and resumed stroking his head . " You come to me at last , did n't you ? " she purred . " I knew you would . I treated you right , did n't I ? I gave you what you wanted , did n't I ? Why was you so mean to your Dorinda ? Why ? " <p> " Dorinda , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy . " <p> She leered at me and stuck out a liver-colored tongue . " His boy is it ? I took back my own . He 's mine , all mine . And now I 've got the daddy , my love , my heart 's desire . " <p> Charles stared wild-eyed at us as the talons stroked his face , a long sharp nail playing with his eye . <p> " Dorinda , you stop talking nonsense and let him go , " I said . To Henry I whispered , " Get ready . First chance you get , you send it back to hell . " <p> " No , no , no , my clever one . He came to me , he did , just like you all do sooner or later . The pretty ones that beg for my help then spit on me in the streets . Oh yes , he came for a cure to fix his barren woman . And I says what price will you pay . And he says anything . So I let him take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and screamed at the moon when the pains was too bad to bear and he said he would take me away and be my man , but instead he took the baby away and threw money in my face and told me he 'd kill poor Dorinda if I said a word . Now was that a way to treat the woman who loves you beyond all earthly things ? " <p> Charles looked at me , so desperate to deny her story I knew she must be telling the truth . <p> " Well , that 's real sad , " I said . " You were treated bad . But it 's all over now , Dorinda . Give him back to us . Give us his boy . " <p> The talons gripped Charles 's face as if it were an apple . He cried out and Dorinda crooned , " Hush , hush , my love . Dorinda would never hurt her love . " Without looking away from Charles , Dorinda whispered , " He were n't the only one , you know . Lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all wanted something . Men wanted a good harvest . Women wanted the man of their hearts , or to bear children . Men mostly just wanted Dorinda when their women was n't enough to satisfy them . And then they spit on me and called me whore . Well , that 's all over now , is n't it , my love ? " <p> As if Charles were as light as a baby , Dorinda lifted him off his feet by his head . Charles screamed , his feet thrashing above the ground . I stood paralyzed with fear and helplessness . <p> " Stop it ! " I screamed . " Stop it ! " <p> Cornwall leaped and snarled . <p> Then there was another scream , only this one came from Henry . Like a mad cavalryman , he charged past me , holding his musket as if to impale Dorinda on an imaginary bayonet . He almost reached her . Dorinda 's free hand swung in an arc , caught Henry on the side of the head and sent him flying . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demented fireflies in the dark , thunder ricocheted off the mountains and smoke curled through the moonlight . Dorinda stared down at her chest in surprise . She dropped Charles and stepped backward , her hands clutching the wound ripped into her chest by a musket fired so close . She looked at me like a confused child . Cornwall attacked , raking her leg with his fangs , She stumbled away from the dog , then fell , rolling head over heels down the bluff until her body crashed into a massive oak and lay still . <p> I could move again . I rushed first to Charles , who was breathing but out cold . Then to Henry . Dorinda 's talons had raked deep scratches into his face , but he was alive . His eyes opened , he stared blankly at me , then shook sense into his brain . <p> " It 's over , " I said . " She 's dead . " <p> Henry nodded .

Sometimes he stands in his fields staring into the mountains and waiting for her to return . Naturally , none of us said anything about what Charles did to Dorinda . There was no point . <p> The people of New Hope look differently at Henry now . He wears the scars on his face like a badge and walks with a strut . Years later , we asked Henry to be our part-time constable . He said yes , of course , and likes to entertain children with the story of his adventure on Downy Mount while he shows them the very same musket that killed the beast . He 's the closest thing to a hero New Hope ever had . <p> And I sleep only in fits and starts , waking at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Rachel and my children are safe .
