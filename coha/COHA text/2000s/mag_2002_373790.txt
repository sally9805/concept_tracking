By definition , a diva is a rampaging female ego redeemed only in part by a lovely voice . It 's hard to imagine why anyone would want to be one , but a new generation of female talent appears to be weirdly enamored of the word and the idea . <P> Faith Hill is one of the new would-be divas . She 's the country one  --  the sweet blond married to fellow sweet blond Tim McGraw . Hill 's previous album , Breathe , sold 7 million copies , which gives her pretty good diva credentials . She 's popular , but her new album , Cry ( Warner Bros. ) , proves she does n't really understand why . <P> Hill 's two best hits  --  1998 's This Kiss and 1999 's The Way You Love Me  --  were frisky mid-tempo numbers that played to the strengths of her voice . It 's not a big instrument , but it 's smooth and confident and relaxed . On Cry , that ease is absent for frustratingly long periods . The album opens with Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill characteristically undersings . The first sign of trouble is the title track , a big , diva-ish song that she strains to pull off . It works because the hook is a winner  --  " Could you cry a little/Lie just a little "  --  but Hill seems very ill at ease when she 's required to blow away the swirling chorus at the heart of the song . <P> By the middle of Cry , things are seriously out of whack . The songwriting strategy is to alternate among big love ballads , upbeat rockers and quieter , more revealing personal songs . But when Hill opens up , she shows us almost nothing at all . On This Is Me , she sings , " My heart breaks for the homeless/I worry about my parents ... I am just like everybody else/I try to love Jesus and myself . " If This Is Me is really her , then McGraw is one bored cowboy . <P> When Hill goes for diva moments , the songs collapse beneath her . Beautiful has spoken-word verses that recall late-night Cinemax soft-core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the way you hold me with your eyes/Hold me so tight that I ca n't move/It 's like everything I 've ever known is a lie , and you 're the simple truth . " Beautiful ends with one of those cheap " Take it up a notch ! " key changes , as does Unsaveable , the song that follows . Hill 's longtime producers , Byron Gallimore and Dann Huff , have done her no great favors by using such tricks . <P> There are a few tunes  --  Stronger , One  --  that work just fine , and Hill 's flirtation with gospel ( a choir performs a conspicuous backup on a few tracks ) is convincing enough . But mostly Hill has made an album that shows off her weaknesses and obscures her charms . Even divas need to give the audience what it wants .  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
