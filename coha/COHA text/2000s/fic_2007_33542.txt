#2007 I can usually count on a phone call every day from my mother 's dog , and today was no different . Paz is my mother 's new toy Chihuahua that she totes everywhere she goes . When he sits in Mother 's purse , his little paws often hit the redial button on her cell phone which means I 'm in for at least ten minutes of unwilling eavesdropping on Anjoli 's life until she finally hears me shouting , begging her to hang up the phone . My mother discovered a phone with a personality that matches hers . It does n't allow me simply to hang up . She has to be the one who decides to disengage . I can hang up on her , but when I pick up the phone a few minutes later to make a call of my own , she 's still there . This is the story of my life . With most women her age you might think I 'd hear her attending lectures at elder hostels , playing bridge , or consulting a podiatrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come to expect nothing less than the shocking , ridiculous , and thoroughly appalling . Hearing the details of her life firsthand ( rather than the somewhat sanitized version she tells me ) is a bit much , though . Just last week I heard her mantra consultant telling my mother that if she was n't willing to chew her food until it was fully liquefied , the chanting could n't possibly heal her lower back pain . I also heard Anjoli telling one of her customers at the Drama Queen bookshop that he hadtweezed his eyebrows too thin . She then proceeded to give him tips on creating a dramatic , but not overdone , arch . And truly disturbing , I heard Anjoli having sex with her Pilates instructor . I hung up immediately , but moments later when I picked up the phone to make another call , Mother had still not disconnected . Literally . Some of my friends complain that their parents are overly involved in their lives and thought I should be grateful my mother has such a full schedule . But Anjoli 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite activity- " helping " me with my two-year-old son , and visiting Jack and me at our new home in the Berkshire Mountains . We closed escrow on an old , four-bedroom home last winter and have been making improvements to the main house and three guest cottages with the intention of opening them to visiting artists next month . Do n't get me wrong . I love my mother dearly . But as Jack has noticed , she 's like a vapor . When she enters a room , she occupies every bit of space . Corners we had n't even discovered are suddenly filled with the presence of my mother . Still , she 's my mother , so like most daughters I have feelings about her that range from complete adoration to total frustration . And if I 'm being entirely honest , there 's a tablespoon of jealousy added into the mix . Not only is Anjoli the darling of New York 's theatre district , with friends-and enemies-around the globe , she 's also a drop-dead gorgeous , blond version of Sophia Loren with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , Paz is the newest addition to our family . Anjoli called me a few weeks ago to thank me for hosting Thanksgiving dinner . As she put it , " Having family around the dinner table activated my issues , darling . It reminded me of how very important our connections to others are . You know what a nurturing soul I am so this should n't surprise you too much . " Without pause , she continued , " I 've adopted a puppy and I 'm calling him Paz . " This would have been the end of it for most people . They might put a photo in their wallet , mention the new puppy at work , or maybe even buy a few silly dog toys . My mother sent a formal announcement on white textured silk cards which invited guests to the puppy blessing of the winter season . After Paz was lightly doused with warm water , my mother 's friends raised their champagne glasses to toast the puppy of honor . She served organic hors d'oeuvres shaped like mini dog bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppy , darling ? " Anjoli said when she brought Paz to visit for Christmas . Despite my mother 's delusions that she was a great nurturer , I was surprised when she first announced the adoption . " I did n't know you liked dogs , " I said . " I do n't , " she returned quickly . " But Paz is n't like other dogs , darling . He 's the sweetest little teacup Chihuahua . He fits in my purse and does n't even bark . He has a tiny little yelp that you can hardly even hear , and when you do , it is n't the least bit disturbing . Oh darling , I adore this little peanut ! " " You 're going to carry a dog around in your purse ? " I asked incredulously , wondering if my mother knew this was a long-term commitment , not a new accessory . " Who are you , Paris Hilton ? " " Who ? " I tried again . " Who are you , Zsa Zsa Gabor ? " " Would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's true , you 'd probably have sex with him . " Anjoli laughed . " That 's something your father would say . " They divorced early enough in the marriage that they remained quite civil . Whenever my father had come to pick me up on Sundays , it had been very amicable . Without everything else that comes with a marriage , my parents got along astonishingly well . " So you 're calling this dog Paws ? " I asked when she first told me about the adoption . " Not Paws , darling . Paz , Paz . It means ' peace ' in Spanish . Paz is Latino . " " I 'm just a little surprised . I never saw you as the type to own a dog . " " It was love at first sight , darling . As soon as I saw him , I knew he was my baby . " The more I thought about my mother saving this Chihuahua puppy from the dog pound , the more I thought it was a sweet idea . So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him around Manhattan in a Louis Vuitton satchel ? The fact of the matter was that my mother was connecting with her nurturing side . And Paz did n't exactly get a raw deal . This Chihuahua would have the best of everything , which is a hell of a lot better than the life he would have known at the dog pound , or even if he 'd been adopted by a normal person . When I first told Jack about Anjoli adopting a dog , he was surprised to say the least . " Does she realize how much work a dog is ? Does she understand she needs to take the dog out of her purse every couple hours to take a crap ? " " I 'm sure she 's aware of a dog 's biological functions , " I defended . I think it 's a commonly shared sentiment that the only person allowed to be critical of parents is their own children . Since I had no siblings , I cornered the market on Anjoli-bashing . Jack continued , " You think she 'll remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she forgot to feed you most nights . " That 's not exactly what I said . During that starry-eyed time when a couple is first getting to know each other-comparing their childhoods , their families , and their hopes for the future-I mentioned that my mother did n't prepare meals the way most did . Her usual dinner preparation was what I came to know as " ten on the table , " which meant Anjoli left ten dollars on the dining room table so I could buy myself the meal of my choosing . Back in the seventies and early eighties , this was a windfall for a kid . There were dozens of restaurants from sushi bars to hot dog stands all within a short walk of our brownstone on West Eleventh Street . There was Balducci 's Italian market , Joe Jr . ' s diner , and Ray 's Pizza , among others . There was Chinese , Indian , and Cambodian . Nearly every nation was represented by its cuisine . As a child , I loved the freedom , nonetheless Jack had a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Burberry 's Nova check pattern beret and poncho bopping down Sixth Avenue clutching a ten dollar bill in his teeth . Poor thing could n't even reach the counter to place his order . " Jack , I 'm sure Anjoli will be wonderful to the dog , " I assured him . " Let 's give her the benefit of the doubt . The New Year is all about people changing for the better . Neither of us is perfect , but we 're getting better every year , " I said , winking . Jack pulled me in toward him with one arm and hugged me . " That 's what I love about you , Luce . You always see the best in people . " " I really think she 's going to surprise us both , " I said . " This dog could be just what she needs to tap into her maternal instincts . " Anjoli had changed over the past year . When she visits the house , she always generously volunteers to supervise the handymen so I can take Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that she was willing to change urine-only diapers . Anjoli even broke down and bought a cell phone last summer so we could talk more often , despite the fact she believed they cause ear cancer . When she first started using the phone , Anjoli kept sterilized cotton in her ears to protect herself from the radiation , but found that this also made it difficult to hear . Then she discovered that her phone had a speaker , and now keeps it on so she does n't have to bring the receiver to her ear . Admittedly , this is less than considerate to the people who have to listen to both ends of her phone conversations , but New Yorkers have seen-and heard-everything . What 's another designer-clad grandmother carrying on a semipornographic conversation with a lover who 's unaware that his voice is being blasted through Astor place ? Adding to the list of Anjoli 's changes was that she not only agreed to take Adam to the Central Park Zoo last summer , she was the one who suggested it . When I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The animals do n't even do anything , darling , " she explained . " I 'll get tickets for you and your father to go to the circus this Sunday . The lions will do tricks instead of simply standing around and growling . That 's entertainment ? ! " Thirty years later , she realized that children love to see animals , and the entertainment for the adults was witnessing the look of delight and discovery in a child 's eyes . When Anjoli and Adam returned from one of their days at the zoo last summer , my mother was a bit miffed because a goat ate a Playbill that was sticking out from her purse . " What in my consciousness attracted that interaction ? ! " she asked Jack and I , who were waiting at my mother 's apartment . " What ? " Jack asked , not because he did n't hear her , but because he wanted to clarify what she meant . And truth be told , I 'm sure he understood exactly what she meant , but delighted in having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Anjoli 's New Age musings added to the benefits package of this marriage . Meaning , he enjoyed laughing at my mother 's frivolity . It was just one of the many things we shared in common . She repeated , " What in my consciousness attracted that animal ? " " Mother , it 's a goat . You had paper hanging out of your purse . Goats eat paper , " I said , nudging Jack with my elbow . " Darlings , several people had paper in their possession ! " she explained . Jack rested back in the couch , hoping this conversation would continue . " How close were you to the gate ? " " Who knows ? " Anjoli said , shooing with her hand . " Who pays attention to that sort of thing ? I do n't know , a foot , three feet ? Ten feet ? Somewhere around there . " " Anjoli , " Jack said , laughing . " If a goat ate from your purse , you must have been pretty close to its enclosure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goat took the Playbill , Mother ? " " I do n't know . Alfie called and said there was some sort of problem with the credit card machine at the store . I guess I was near the goat cage . " Mocking Perry Mason , Jack added . " Was your bag zipped , Anjoli ? " " Zipped ? " she said as if she 'd never heard of the concept . He continued , " Or was it wide open like it is now ? " He rushed over to her purse and held it up as if he were presenting Exhibit A to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury . " Look at this bag . There are two take-out menus , a day planner , five sheets of loose paper , and a pack of tissues . You 've got a regular goat feedbag here . " By this time , Anjoli was laughing her silent inhale of a laugh . Jack continued , " I must argue that it was not , in fact , your consciousness that attracted said goat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunting , dare I say inviting any normal red-blooded goat to help himself to the contents of your purse ! " Anjoli laughed and declared herself guilty of being a flake . Jack was such fun these days . It 's hard to imagine that just three years earlier we almost divorced . My cousin Richard always says that everyone has two marriages , but the lucky ones get to have them both with the same person . Jack 's and my marriage was far from seamless , but it was definitely experiencing a renaissance . Appropriately enough he 's a painter . And my body is pale and doughy . As I thought back to the day last summer when Anjoli 's Playbill was snatched from her purse by the goat at the zoo , I hoped that she 'd be more careful now that Paz was her cargo . Of course , at the core , Anjoli was the same goddess of her own universe . She still dabbled in every New Age healing workshop New York offered . When Jack and I first moved in to our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as a housewarming gift . She 'd just completed a six-week ghost-busting class and danced around the house burning sage incense and ringing Tingsha bells in every corner . For Christmas , she gave us a refresher cleansing , using the techniques she recently learned at an advanced space-clearing class in Los Angeles . She chanted and blew high-pitch notes through a thin bamboo flutelike instrument . Jack and I learned long ago just to roll our eyes and thank her . There was no use fighting Anjoli and her magical thinking . She was convinced that all old homes were potential apparition hotels , and insisted she save us from some crotchety dead colonial dude with an ax to grind . Jack and I just shrugged and let her chant away while our neighbors sang " Silent Night " at the doorstep . She is odd for sure , but she 's my mother . Plus , what harm could she do ? Chapter Two So anyway , I digress just a bit , which I must confess is quite typical . Back to Paz and his phone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard an unfamiliar Chinese man 's voice say in the background . I knew my mother must be at one of her alternative healers and that Paz must have hit the redial button before being removed from her purse . Anjoli had a troubling and persistent ailment called perfect health that she was determined to overcome . It 's hard to keep up with all of her recovery programs , but she 's done the gamut . She 's spun her chakras , had her eyeballs and tongue analyzed , and even flown to New Mexico to have protective white light woven around her aura . She always manages to do a little shopping wherever she is as well . Once when I was in the fifth grade , I returned home to find my mother and eight bare-breasted women chanting , " I am in the center of light , I am here to express delight . " Mother was so filled with spiritual delight that she got laryngitis . A guest got a nasty mosquito bite near her nipple . One of Anjoli 's tenants called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anger . " Relax and breathe , " the Chinese man repeated . " I 'm not sure he understands , " I heard my mother 's voice through the phone . " Mother ! " I shouted . " Mother , I 'm on the phone ! Can you hear me ? Hang up the phone ! " Where was she ? And why was the person she was with so zoned out that he could n't understand the Chinese man 's simple instruction to relax and breathe ? " Anjoli continued , " Doctor , will the needles hurt him ? " " He wo n't feel a thing , " the doctor assured . Who wo n't feel a thing ? Needles ? This sounded more serious than eyeball analysis . " Mother ! It 's Lucy . Your dog 's calling me again . What 's going on ? " " Lucy , is that you , darling ? " I heard her voice in the distance . I shouted , " Pick up the phone . " " Doctor , do you have any sterilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I heard her voice again . " Lucy , darling , " she whispered , undoubtedly clutching the phone to her ear . " It 's such a relief to hear from you . I 'm in crisis , " she said with her usual accent on the word crisis . She meant to sound French , but it actually only sounded plural .
