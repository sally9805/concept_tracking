Chapter One Sherwood Forest , Nottinghamshire , 1217 Sir William Bowman glanced back at the big black gelding lagging along behind him . Bran had come up lame soon after they 'd entered the forest , but they could n't stop yet . Pausing to stroke the horse 's swollen fetlock , Will murmured soothing words rather than the curses echoing through his head , gave a gentle tug on the reins and picked up his stride . The sun disappeared behind the tall trees , leaving naught but an eerie yellow glow that made specters of the branches overhanging the narrow path . Will peered into the deepening gloom . Not true night , but close enough to warn him he 'd best find shelter soon . Like a fool , he 'd allowed his anger to distract him ; he 'd already wandered so deep into the dense forest he wondered if he 'd e'er find his way out again . He and Bran had roamed far in Lord Rannulf 's service these past weeks , a long journey nowhere near finished . What he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a warm and willing maid at the end of this part of it ! Yet thanks to Sir Richard Belleville 's overcautious nature , Will now found himself lost in Nottingham forest with an injured mount instead of lodged comfortably at the next keep along his way , where he 'd planned to spend the night . Damn Sir Richard ! He 'd kept Will so occupied with trivialities that he 'd had no chance to leave Birkland-surely the least important of Lord Rannulf 's keeps-until well after the midday meal . Yet when Will had suggested he wait until the next morn to resume his travels , the slippery knave had nigh slammed the gates behind Will himself ! And in their haste to see Will escorted on his way , it seemed Sir Richard 's men had set Will upon the wrong path through the forest , for ' t was clear this route had seen little traffic of late . Nor did it appear to lead anywhere but deeper into the wilderness of Sherwood . He could do naught to remedy that mistake tonight , alas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use the sense God gave him to find his way out of this dilemma . Assuming , of course , that he had any sense . His low chuckle sounded loud in the silent woods . Judging by his recent behavior , that seemed doubtful . He squared his shoulders and buried deep the lingering sense of imminent threat that skittered down his spine . He was a knight well blooded in his lord 's service , he reminded himself sternly , not some cringing villain afraid of shadows and looming dark . Bran nudged him in the back as though to urge him to move faster and crept up nigh onto Will 's heels . Had the gelding with his better hearing noticed something he could not ? Will shifted the reins to his left hand and hitched his sword into a more accessible position with his right . Best to be prepared . At least the outlaws of years past were no more-a blessing , no doubt , though the thought of spending time with their legendary band held a tantalizing appeal . Tales of Robin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marches where l'Eau Clair Keep stood guard over the Welsh border . As a youth , Will had been fascinated by the stories ; time and again he and his compatriots had roamed the rugged countryside in search of adventures , taking it in turn to be part of the band of outlaws or the sheriff 's henchmen . A flock of birds shot up out of the brush , startling him from his memories and sending Bran into a squealing , plunging frenzy . Teeth bared and ears pressed flat , the gelding reared back , dragging Will along with him . " Easy , lad , " Will crooned , grabbing at the slippery leather as the reins slipped through his gloved hand and his feet slid through the loose leaves covering the ground . By the rood , he 'd ne'er seen Bran react so sharply to so little provocation ! Wanting to free his sword hand to hold the bucking beast , Will tried to shove his sword into the scabbard one-handed , but another bird swooped close overhead . Bran jerked back hard .

Cursing in a mixture of Welsh , English and Norman French-which did n't relieve his frustration a whit-Will fought the clinging brambles and twisted free of the thick brush . Jesu , ' t was a miracle he had n't impaled himself on his own blade ! He wrenched his sword belt around and rammed the weapon home , plucking thorns and leaves from his surcoat . He could only be glad he 'd been wearing his mail , for other than a few scratches on his cheek , he 'd emerged unscathed . But Bran had disappeared into the night , carrying with him all of Will 's baggage save the small pack he carried slung over one shoulder . He 'd best go after the beast at once , before it got too dark to follow him .
