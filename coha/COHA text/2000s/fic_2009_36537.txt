That summer when I first became Elliot Hull 's pretend wife , I understood only vaguely that complicated things often prefer to masquerade as simple things at first . This is why they 're so hard to avoid , or at least brace for . I should have known this  --  it was built into my childhood . But I did n't see the complications of Elliot Hull coming , perhaps because I did n't want to . So I did n't avoid them or even brace for them , and as a result , I eventually found myself looking out of a broken window in winter watching two grown men  --  my pretend husband and my real husband  --  wrestle on a front lawn amid a spray of golf clubs in the snow  --  such a blur of motion in the dim porch light that I could n't distinguish one man from the other . This would become one of the most vaudevillian and poignant moments of my life , when things took the sharpest turn in a long and twisted line of smaller , seemingly simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing in line in a crowded ice-cream shop  --  the whir of a blender , the fogged glass counter , the humidity pouring in from the door with its jangling bell . It was late summer , one of the last hot days of the season . The air-conditioning was rolling down from overhead and I 'd paused under one of the cool currents , causing a small hiccup in the line . Peter was off talking to someone from work : Gary , a fellow anesthesiologist  --  a man in a pink-striped polo shirt , surrounded by his squat children holding ice-cream cones melting into softened napkins . The kids were small enough not to care that they were eating bits of their napkins along with the ice cream . And Gary was too distracted to notice . He was clapping Peter on the back and laughing loudly , which is what people do to Peter . I 've never understood why , exactly , except that people genuinely like him . He 's disarming , affable . There 's something about him , the air of someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , but he seemed to be the laid-back president of this club , and when you were talking with him , you were in the club too . But my mind was on the kids in that moment  --  I felt sorry for them , and I decided that one day I 'd be the kind of mother not to let her children eat bits of soggy napkin . ( I do n't remember what kind of mother mine was  --  distracted or hovering or , most likely , both ? She died when I was five years old . In some pictures , she 's doting on me  --  cutting a birthday cake outside , her hair flipping up in the breeze . But in group photos , she 's always the one looking off to the side , down in her own lap , or to some distant point beyond the photographer  --  like an avid bird-watcher . And my father was not a reliable source of information . It pained him , so he rarely talked about her . <br> I was watching the scene intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable with having a husband , after three years I was becoming more surprised by it . Or maybe I was more surprised not that I was his wife but that I was anybody 's wife , really . The word wife was so wifey that it made me squeamish  --  it made me think of aprons and meat loaf and household cleansers . You 'd think the word would have evolved for me by that point  --  or perhaps it had evolved for most people into cell phones and aftercare and therapy , but I was the one who was stuck  --  like some gilled species unable to breathe up on the mudflats . <br> Although Peter and I had been together for a total of five years , I felt like I did n't know him at all sometimes . Like at that very moment , as he was being back-clapped and jostled by the guy in the pink-striped polo shirt , I felt as if I 'd spotted some rare species called husband in its natural habitat . I was wondering what its habits were  --  eating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's difficult to explain , but more and more often I 'd begun to rear back like this , to witness my life as a National Geographic reporter , someone with a British accent who found my life not so much exciting as curious . <br> The ice-cream shop was packed , and the two high school girls on staff were stressed , their faces damp and pinched , bangs sticking to their foreheads , their matching eyeliner gone smeary . I 'd finally made my way to the curved counter and placed my order . Soon enough I was holding a cone of pistachio for Peter and waiting for a cup of vanilla frozen yogurt for myself . <br> That 's when the more beleaguered of the two scoopers finished someone else 's order and shouted to a customer behind me . " What do you want ? " <br> A man answered . " I 'll have two scoops of Gwen Merchant , please . " <br> I spun around , sure I 'd misheard , because I am Gwen Merchant  --  or I was before I got married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost from my past  --  Elliot Hull . I was instantly overwhelmed by the sight of him  --  Elliot Hull with his thick dark hair and his beautiful eyebrows , standing there with his hands in his pockets looking tender and boyish . I do n't know why , but I felt like I 'd been waiting for him , without knowing I 'd been waiting for him . And I was n't so much happy as I was relieved that he 'd finally shown up again . Some strange but significant part of me felt like throwing my arms around him , as if he 'd come to save me , and saying , Thank God , you finally showed up ! What took you so long ? Let 's get out of here . <br> But I could n't really have been thinking this . Not way back then . I must be projecting  --  backwards  --  and there must be a term for this : projecting backwards , but I do n't know what it is . I could n't have been thinking that Elliot Hull had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed saving . ( And , of course , I 'd have to save myself in the end . ) The only conclusion I can draw is that maybe he represented some lost part of myself . And I must have realized on some level that it was n't that I 'd been missing only Elliot Hull . I must have been missing the person I 'd been when I 'd known him  --  that Gwen Merchant  --  the somewhat goofy , irreverent , seriously un-wifely part  --  two scoops of her . <br> Plus , did I really even know Elliot all that well ? We 'd met at a freshman orientation icebreaker  --  a dismal event really  --  at Loyola College , the one in Baltimore , and then , in the spring of our senior year we had an intense , messy , short-lived relationship  --  three weeks of inseparableness that ended when I 'd slapped him in a bar . I had n't seen Elliot Hull since a cookies-and-punch reception after the English Department 's awards ceremony at graduation ten years earlier . <br> Regardless , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my eyes stinging with tears . The air-conditioning was pressing my hair flat . I stepped out of the gust and pretended that I was n't sure it was him at all . " Elliot Hull ? " I asked . I did this , I think , because I was terrified by the tide of joy in my chest . Also , I remembered enough about our relationship that I did n't want to give him the satisfaction of immediate recognition . He was the type to notice something like that and be a little smug about it . <br> He looked older , but not much . In fact , he had the lean body of a man who would age well  --  who , in his seventies , might be described by the word spry . His jaw was more set . He was n't clean shaven . He was wearing a faded pale blue T-shirt that was fraying at the neck , a Red Sox ball cap , and shorts that were way too baggy . " Gwen , " he said , his voice tinged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " What are you doing here ? " I asked . This is only Elliot Hull , I tried to remind myself . I did n't remember why I 'd slapped him , but I did remember that he 'd deserved it . We 'd been at a bar in Towson , just a few miles from this ice-cream shop , in fact . <br> " That sounded like an accusation , " he said . " I 'm an innocent man . I 'm ordering ice cream . " <br> The girl behind the counter said , " Um , sir , we really do n't have that flavor ? Do you want to pick a real flavor or something ? " Kids today can be very earnest . <br> " Double chocolate with marshmallows and peanuts and hot fudge and some caramel . " He leaned toward the chalkboard mounted on the wall and squinted . " And whipped cream and three cherries . " <br> " Three ? " the girl asked , disgusted by the gratuitous demands of humanity , I assume  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me . <br> " Really , " I said . " Three cherries . " <br> " I like cherries , " he said . <br> " So , are you a rapper now ? " I asked , pointing to his baggy shorts . This was an obnoxious thing to say . But I suddenly felt obnoxious . I 'd once been an obnoxious flirt , who 'd turned into a more refined flirt , but Elliot was causing me to regress  --  or return to some more elemental part of myself . <br> " I could bust a rhyme , " he said . " Do you want me to ? " <br> " No , no , " I said , knowing he just might . " Please do n't . " <br> There was a lull then , and I let it lull there , lullingly . Why further engage Elliot Hull ? I was married now . Was I going to become friends with him ? Married women do n't suddenly befriend men with whom they once ended a relationship by slapping them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a philosopher , actually , " he said . " I philosophize . And I 'm a professor , so I sometimes also profess . " <br> " Ah , well , that fits , " I said . " You 're the brooder . That 's what my friends called you in college . So now you brood , you know , professionally . Do n't philosophers brood ? " My father was a professor  --  a marine biologist  --  so I knew how professors could be the brooding type . As a child , I was hauled to numerous potluck faculty dinners  --  the air stiff with all of the brooding and professing . <br> " I was n't a brooder . Did I brood ? " <br> " By the end of college , you 'd really honed the art . " <br> " Brooding has n't really taken off the way I 'd hoped  --  as a national trend . " <br> " I think contentment is all the rage , " I said . " Blind contentment . " <br> " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and I 'm keynoting so . . . What are you doing these days ? " <br> " Me ? Well , I just started something new . Sales . Interior design , kind of . It 's a mishmash , " I said . I had a history of swapping one job for another , something I was n't proud of . My resume was buckshot . I 'd just quit a job in admissions at a boarding school . I claimed that I was tired of the elitism , but then I took a somewhat soft part-time job working for more rich people as an assistant to an interior designer who mainly staged upscale homes for sale . I was the one who talked to prospective clients about the nuts and bolts  --  quoting possible profits from staging a house before selling , using charts  --  while my boss , an ethereal , wispy woman in billowy outfits , would walk around the house feigning artistic inspiration . Her name was Eila , but a few days into the job , she told me that her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who would trust an artiste named Sheila ? You have to do what you have to do . " Then she sniffed her scarf . " Did that last place smell like Doberman or what ? " <br> " Interior design ? " Elliot said , intrigued . " I do n't remember your dorm room being overly feng shui . Did n't you bolt a hammock to the walls in the minikitchen ? " <br> " What can I say ? I 've always had an eye . " <br> In the distance , I heard one of the scoopers say , " Ma'am , ma'am ? " Of course , I did n't really register it , because I 'm not old enough to be a ma'am . But then Elliot said , " Um , ma'am , " and he pointed to the scooper . " Your ice cream . " <br> " Here , " the scooper said , handing me my cup of vanilla frozen yogurt . <br> " Thanks , " I said . " A lot . " I shuffled down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was nice to see you , Elliot , " I said in my summarizing voice . <br> " Wait , " he said . " We should get together . I just moved back to town . You could show me what 's changed . " <br> " I think you 'll get a feel for it , " I said , paying the cashier . " You 're a clever boy . " <br> He smiled at me then , his clever smile  --  it was always so much a part of him that I assumed he was born smiling cleverly . " How about tonight ? " he asked , nudging past people so that we were side by side now . " I could take you to dinner and then you could take me sightseeing . " <br> " I 've got plans tonight , " I said . " Sorry . " <br> " What plans ? " <br> I hesitated . " A party . " <br> " You could take me . Introduce me to people . Pawn me off on them , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . Did n't you do a cookie drive once ? I remember buying cookies from you with some poster board involved . " <br> He looked so hopeful that I was suddenly afraid he was going to ask me out . " Look , I 'm married , " I told him finally . <br> He laughed . " Funny . " <br> " What 's funny about that ? " <br> " Nothing . . . It 's just . . . " <br> " Just what ? Do you think I 'm unmarriable or something ? " <br> " You 're just not married . " <br> " Yes , I am . " <br> " No , you are n't . " <br> " I 'm Gwen Stevens now . " I lifted up my hand , showing the ring as proof . <br> He was stunned . " You 're really . . . married ? " <br> " That sounded like an accusation , " I said . " I 'm an innocent woman . An innocent wife . " <br> " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marriage is so barbaric . It 's like a blood sport . " <br> " See , that 's the kind of insulting thing you say that makes people slap you , " I told him . <br> He raised his eyebrows and kicked his head back a little . " You did n't really slap me , " he said . " You just grabbed my face . Very hard . It did n't do any good anyway , " he said , his arms outstretched like he was some proof of a failed face-grabbing . <br> " Were n't you engaged to that girl , Ellen something ? " I asked . Her name was Ellen Maddox . I could still see her face . " I thought you two got back together . . . " <br> " She left me right after college for a flight attendant , a male flight attendant . " He said male flight attendant as if it was worse than a female flight attendant . " Anyway , I stick by what I said to you that made you grab my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . " <br> I must have looked at him questioningly . I could n't remember what he 'd said exactly , but I did n't have time to ask . One of the scoopers handed him his gargantuan cone and he was fumbling through his wallet just as Peter surfaced . " Hello ! " he said , looking at Elliot in a very well-mannered way . Peter can turn on these impeccable manners  --  like a boy who went to boarding school in the 1950s and is now trying to compensate for a lack of parental love by asserting a chin-uppedness about life . This humility was an act . Peter was raised to be confident in all things  --  perhaps most of all in love . <br> I handed him his cone . " This is Elliot Hull . He once bought a cookie from me in college to help raise money for sea otters . " <br> " Ah , poor sea otters ! " Peter said , extending his hand . " I 'm Peter . " <br> Elliot shook it and shot me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You are married ! And he 's tall ! And then he said , " Gwen just invited me to the party tonight . I 'm new to town . " <br> " Great idea ! " Peter said , and before I had a chance to clarify , he was giving Elliot directions . I was still stunned that Elliot Hull was back in my life , and that it had happened so quickly . See , it was simple . That 's what I mean : I had n't done anything to start it . I was just standing in line at an ice-cream shop one minute and then suddenly I was watching Peter make some gestures that might indicate that Elliot would have to make a turn out of a rotary , and then he pointed to his left , his arm straight out at his side , and I thought of the word wingspan again . Peter is tall . He has an excellent wingspan . <br> But there was Elliot Hull , standing next to him , and he was not tall and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . He was being Elliot Hull , thinking his brooding thoughts , no doubt . Had we kind of thought we were in love with each other a decade ago ? <br> When Peter was finished , he said , " Got it ? " <br> " I 've got it , " Elliot said , and then he looked at me . I was about to wave a noncommital good-bye , but then Elliot said , " Gwen Merchant , huh , after all these years . " And suddenly it was as if I were the rare bird . I felt a little self-conscious . I might have even blushed and I could n't remember the last time I blushed . " See you tonight ! " he said , then took a bite of his abundant ice cream and walked out of the shop , one hand in his baggy shorts . <br> Continues ...
