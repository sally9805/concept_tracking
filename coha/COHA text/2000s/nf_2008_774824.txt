LIBERAL MOTTO : SPEAK LOUDLY , AND CARRY A SMALL VICTIM // Liberals always have to be the victims , particularly when they are oppressing others . Modern victims aren ? t victims because of what they have suffered ; they are victims of convenience for the Left . There ? s no way to determine if an action is offensive by looking at the action . One must know who did it to whom , and whose side the most powerful people in America will take . Republican senator Trent Lott committed a hate crime when he praised former segregationist Strom Thurmond at a birthday party , but a year later , Democratic senator Chris Dodd did nothing wrong when he praised a former Ku Klux Klanner , Senator Robert Byrd  --  who was also a sort of " community organizer . " // Playing the game of He Who Is Offended First Wins , the key to any political argument is to pretend to be insulted and register operatic anger . Liberals are the masters of finger-wagging indignation . They will wail about some perceived slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never before witnessed the liberals ? capacity to invoke synthetic outrage . Distracted by the crocodile tears of the liberal , Americans don ? t notice that these fake victims are attacking , advancing , and creating genuine victims . // Just as we ? re always told that schoolyard bullies are actually deeply insecure , liberals rationalize their own ferocious behavior by claiming to have been wounded somehow . What about the little guy our poor , insecure bully is beating the living daylights out of ? How ? s his self-esteem coming along ? That is the essence of liberals : They viciously attack everyone else , while wailing that they are the victims . // Liberals ? infernal habit of accusing others of what they themselves are doing distracts attention from who is really being attacked . No one is victimized by a mouse : Real victims are those who are called the oppressors by the powerful . Just as Nazi mythology made ordinary working Germans believe they were victims of Jewish oppressors  --  in order to oppress the Jews  --  today ? s media-certified victims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real victims . To find the authentic victims in most situations , one can simply refer to the people the mainstream media urge us to hate , beasts such as George Bush , the Duke lacrosse players , Joe McCarthy , Jesse Helms , Tom DeLay , the Swift Boat Veterans , and Sarah Palin . But often the victims are nameless , faceless victims of repellent liberal policies that are promoted on behalf of counterfeit victims , such as single mothers or " the poor . " Media-anointed victims inevitably create actual victims who became so the old-fashioned way : They earned it . // Fake victims have become so crucial to liberal argument that you need a pathos-meter to follow politics in modern America . Every policy proposal is launched or opposed on the stories of victims . When Senator Hillary Clinton sought more federal money for New York City in 2007 , she made a big show of attending Bush ? s January 2007 State of the Union Address with the son of a New York City police officer , Cesar A. Borja , who had died that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired from working " 16-hour shifts " at the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks . // The New York Daily News had told the tear-jerking story of Cesar Borja a few weeks earlier in an article claiming that " when the twin towers fell , " Borja " rushed to ground zero and started working long days there . " Now he was dying of a rare lung disease , a result , the Daily News suggested , of his having " volunteered to work months of 16-hour shifts in the rubble , breathing in clouds of toxic dust . " 1 // Senator Hillary Clinton seized on the 9/11 victim ? s story , parading Officer Borja ? s twenty-one-year-old son at the State of the Union Address . She even sent President Bush a letter  --  made available to the press  --  inviting him to meet Officer Borja ? s son , at the same time requesting more federal funding for New York ? s emergency workers . The federal money allocated thus far , she said , was " only a down payment in repaying our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of need . " She asked the president to " honor " Officer Borja ? s memory and those who had " lost loved ones as a result of the 9/11 attacks . " 2 // Bush met with Officer Borja ? s son and agreed to the additional federal funding for those suffering nonspecific health problems related to the 9/11 attack . Senator Clinton then released another letter noting " our responsibility to take care of those who took care of us "  --  those who , she said , " selflessly risked their lives and their health at Ground Zero . " 3 // Then it turned out the story of Officer Borja ? s glorious heroism on 9/11 was a complete hoax . Borja had not " rushed " to the disaster site after the attack . He only started working there , directing traffic , near the end of December 2001 , by which time much of the rubble had been cleared away . He was not a volunteer  --  this was his job . Indeed , the only reason he was working sixteen-hour days was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Borja had worked seventeen days at the World Trade Center , most of them in 2002.4 Borja retired in June 2003 and did not begin to develop pulmonary fibrosis until 2005 . There were other possible explanations for his rare lung disease , such as his pack-a-day cigarette habit until five or six years before the 9/11 attack.5 Officer Borja had done nothing dishonorable , but he had not selflessly risked his life at Ground Zero , as Hillary Clinton claimed in order to beg for more taxpayer money for New York City . // Asked about its make-believe reporting on Borja ? s undaunted heroism , the Daily News observed that " the paper had never explicitly said Officer Borja had rushed there soon after Sept. 11 , only that at some point he had rushed there . " 6 No matter  --  he had served his purpose and New York City got its federal funding . // All the Left ? s seminal imagery keeps turning out to be a hoax. // daddy was diving repeatedly into ground zero  --  when he was nowhere near the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told sickening tales about the brutish behavior of American troops in Iraq  --  and then he signed an affidavit admitting he made it all up . John Edwards was the loyal husband to his cancer-stricken wife  --  except it turned out he was carrying on an extended affair with Rielle Hunter . // The Democrats dredge up victim after victim , but it ? s hard to find one real story . Why do liberals keep coming up with hoaxes for our edification ? Time and again , liberals transform themselves into chaste Victorian virgins fainting over the suffering of their victim du jour  --  but then the facts come out , and liberals react like Emily Litella on Saturday Night Live : " Never mind . " // You know you ? ve really made it in America when the Left weeps for you . But this much-sought-after victim status is evanescent , lasting only as long as the fake victim ? s bellyaching advances the liberal agenda . Poor , long-suffering Valerie Plame , Joe Wilson , Scott Ritter , Cindy Sheehan , the Jersey Girls , Scott McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . The liberal establishment has moved on . // It ? s so popular to be a victim in modern American society that people are constantly faking their own hard-luck stories  --  and not just in the " personal statement " essay in their Harvard applications . Among the recent hoax memoirs was one in 2008 by " Margaret B. Jones " called Love and Consequences : A Memoir of Hope and Survival . Jones claimed to be a half-white , half-Native American girl who grew up in a foster home in South Central Los Angeles , raised by an African American mother . She said she ran drugs for the Bloods in the middle of the deadly crack wars of the 1980s , losing her foster brother to the gang wars . Jones gave interviews using an urban black patois , referring to her fellow gang members as her " homies . " In her book she passed on urban wisdom , such as " Trust no one . Even your own momma will sell you out for the right price or if she gets scared enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really Peggy Seltzer , a suburban Valley Girl , who grew up with her biological family in affluent Sherman Oaks , California , where she attended a private day school . The closest she had come to the projects was watching Project Runway on Bravo . Her hoax was exposed when her sister , Cyndi Hoffman , called the publisher after seeing Seltzer ? s photo by a book review in the New York Times  --  which praised the book as a " humane and deeply affecting memoir . " // Even when caught red-handed , Seltzer claimed to be serving a greater good : " I thought it was my opportunity to put a voice to people who people don ? t listen to . " She said others had told her " you should speak for us because nobody else is going to let us in to talk . " Admitting it was " an ego thing , " she explained , " I don ? t know . I just felt that there was good that I could do and there was no other way that someone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Holocaust memoir published in 1997 was exposed as a hoax . In the book , Misha : A Me ; moire of the Holocaust Years , Misha Defonseca described her parents being arrested and deported by the Nazis when she was six years old . She wrote that she went to live with the De Wael family , who gave her the name " Monique , " but she so missed her parents that she embarked on a trans-European trek to find them . Wandering alone throughout Europe , she said she killed a German soldier , was sheltered by a pack of wolves , and saw a train full of Jews headed for the death chamber . So her story was believable. // The memoir was a smash bestseller in Europe and Canada and was on its way to a triumphant success in the United States with both Oprah and Disney expressing interest in the book . But a money dispute with the publisher delayed negotiations  --  and in the meantime the book was exposed as a fraud . // Defonseca really had been born " Monique De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested and later executed by the Nazis for being part of the Belgian Catholic resistance . Defonseca had never gone in search of her parents . To the contrary , she renounced the name of her brave Nazi-resisting parents , saying she had " wanted to forget " her real name since she was four years old because she had been called " daughter of a traitor " after her parents were arrested . She added that all her life she " felt Jewish . . . it was my reality , my way of surviving . " 8 In short , she did everything she could think of to sound more Jewish but complain about being seated too close to the air conditioner . // Another award-winning Holocaust memoir , Binjamin Wilkomirski ? s Fragments : Memories of a Wartime Childhood , was published in 1995 and  --  although it was never an official selection of Oprah ? s Book Club  --  was exposed as a hoax by 1999 . Wilkomirski claimed to have survived Nazi concentration camps as a small boy , drawing gruesome tales of watching his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children eating their own fingers . Genealogists later established that he was the illegitimate child of a Protestant woman , and he had spent the war years safely ensconced in Switzerland with his adoptive parents . // This literary Munchausen syndrome produces Jewish girls trying to be black and gentiles claiming to be Jewish Holocaust survivors . So naturally , when a con artist threesome sought fame and fortune in America , they invented a young fiction author by the name of JT LeRoy , who was a cross-dressing child prostitute , drug addict , vagrant , and AIDS victim . Among the fake transgendered prostitute ? s celebrity entourage were Lou Reed , Courtney Love , Winona Ryder , Carrie Fisher , Tatum O ? Neal , Debbie Harry , Madonna , and Liv Tyler  --  all of whom , when assembled under one roof , conveniently constitute a quorum for a 12-step meeting . // The con artist LeRoy explained his attraction to celebrities , saying , " Artists want to hang out with other artists because that ? s the language they talk " 9  --  which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nonexistent LeRoy was celebrated in a glamorous write-up in Vanity Fair , a glowing profile in the New York Times , and a song , " Cherry Lips , " by Shirley Manson  --  a trio of honors known in the Hamptons as a " hat trick . " A fawning piece in the Boston Globe said of LeRoy ? s hard-luck stories , the " perversity of religious fundamentalists is a near constant in American gothic writing .
