At the Exeter Academy in 1931 , Arthur Schlesinger Jr . plays a board game called Camelot with a roommate whose mother is best friends from convent school with Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy . In the 1970s , Schlesinger lives in a house on Manhattan 's East 64th Street . He looks out his bedroom window one day and sees his neighbor Richard M. Nixon " prowling restlessly around his garden . " In a little while a party begins at the Schlesinger house . A guest  --  invited by a friend of his wife 's  --  comes to the door , a man whom Schlesinger has never met : Alger Hiss . They have a polite chat  --  even though Schlesinger considers Hiss to be just about as guilty as Nixon said he was long years before . <P> History teems with a rich underground life  --  magic premonitions , sly recurrences , what Schlesinger calls " the circularity of things . " Invisible wires vibrate between the dimensions of public and private . Schlesinger is 83 now , a distinguished historian who ( speaking of circularity ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from whom he inherited a familiar cyclical hypothesis of American history , the idea of alternating radicalism and conservatism . <P> The first volume of Schlesinger 's memoirs , A Life in the 20th Century : Innocent Beginnings , 1917-1950 ( Houghton Mifflin ; 557 pages ; $28.95 ) , is a rich , spirited performance . Schlesinger moves energetically down the years , meeting everyone worth meeting , dispensing opinions ( sometimes brilliant , sometimes merely partisan and captious , sometimes dead wrong , as when , early on , he pronounces Harry Truman to be a corrupt mediocrity ) . T.S . Eliot wrote , " The trilling wire in the blood sings beneath inveterate scars , /Appeasing long forgotten wars . " <P> Over six decades , Schlesinger has divided himself between the roles of historian ( author , notably , of the three-volume The Age of Roosevelt , about F.D.R. ) and activist-courtier . His memoir assembles an all-star cast , with anecdotes and subplots playing through the grand events of the Depression and the New Deal , of World War II and the postwar years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader of the American " NCL "  --  the valiantly anti-Stalinist , noncommunist left . <P> The stories Schlesinger tells and the characters he recalls are vivid . After graduating from Harvard in 1938 , Schlesinger went to Cambridge University on a Henry Fellowship just as Chamberlain was disgracing himself at Munich . He met Harold Laski but argued with the radical political scientist about his soft views on the Soviet Union . At the opening of a play called On the Frontier , the authors , Christopher Isherwood and W.H. Auden , sat directly in front of Schlesinger  --  Auden scribbling notes to Isherwood ( which Isherwood could not read in the dark ) and furiously smoking Camels , while John Maynard Keynes stared down impassively from a balcony . <P> Back home , Schlesinger plunged into work on what became his Pulitzer prize-winning The Age of Jackson ( he won a second Pulitzer , in 1966 , for his participant 's history of the Kennedy Administration , A Thousand Days ) . Kept out of the draft by poor eyesight , he worked for the Office of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analysis branch of the oss . Schlesinger politely rejects the Tom Brokaw idea of " the greatest generation " : " Like all wars , our war was accompanied by atrocity and sadism , by stupidities and lies , pomposity and chickenst.
