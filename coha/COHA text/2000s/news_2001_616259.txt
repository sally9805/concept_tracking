<p> Drive through Buckhead , Midtown and downtown these days , and you 'll notice Atlanta is starting to look a little bit taller . After years of planning and construction , new high-rise condominiums are getting the finishing touches while the first homeowners begin to move in . <p> While the moving vans are beginning to pull up at the Borghese , the Phoenix and 2500 Peachtree , more high-rise projects are coming out of the ground . <p> Although the city 's condo market has long included high-rises  --  from the grande dames of Park Place and the Oaks at Buckhead to apartment conversions such as One Buckhead Loop , the Concorde and Mayfair Renaissance  --  real estate professionals say we 're going to see more . <p> " We 've had some new construction high-rises from the beginning , but we 're now seeing more of them than ever before , " said David Tufts , executive vice president of Coldwell Banker the Condo Store . <p> " It 's a fact of the cost of the land and what can be put there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in some cases , you have a lot where you can only put 20 townhouses , but it will handle 200 high-rise homes . " <p> Tufts is excited about the soaring additions to the skyline , some of which have taken three years or longer to complete . <p> " We 're seeing high-rise products that are very exciting , ( and ) they have the height , the views and elements that make them special , " he said . <p> " Places like Museum Tower ( at Centennial Hill ) and Waterford on Piedmont are outstanding : They have 360 degrees of good views . Museum is right on Centennial Park and has a rooftop pool and is n't in a sea of competitors . At Waterford , it 's right on Piedmont Park , near the Rio shopping center and has great amenities . " <p> But what really draws buyers to these newcomers is a combination of tried-and-true real estate principles , Tufts said . " The keys for the success of a building are good design , good location and the amenities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of 2500 Peachtree made a homeowner out of Dr. Doug Smith , who was among the 10-story building 's first move-ins last November . Before he bought his 3,000-square-foot , three-bedroom unit on the second floor , he rented a high-rise unit near Lenox Square . <p> " I leased a condo to see how I 'd like that environment , and it turned out I really did , " said Smith , who works at Northside Hospital . " At 2500 , I liked the Buckhead location and that it was n't grossly large , with 30 or 40 stories . And I wanted something new so I could make it what I wanted from the get-go . " <p> Smith 's unit overlooks the building 's formal gardens and pool , as well as the homes and trees in the neighborhood behind the property . With residents of the 60 units , he 'll share the building 's domed lobby , clubroom , fitness center , extensive art collection and services , from 24-hour concierge to valet parking . <p> Amenities and location lured Warren Mitchell and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for 35 years to a ninth-floor unit in the new Borghese , a 12-story project on Northside Parkway , where condos range from $500,000 to $2.6 million . <p> " I 've been saying for 10 years that our next switch would be to a condominium , " said Mitchell , who has retired from the insurance business . <p> " We 've been looking for quite a while . I went by the Borghese when it just started going up and saw the model , and thought it had a lot more atmosphere and more desirable features than most of the ones I 'd already seen . Most of them have some beautiful views , but this one has a little European touch to it that makes it different . " <p> Inside the Borghese 's Italaniate-style structure are a fitness center , pool , guest suites for visitors and a clubroom . It 's adjacent to Piazza at Paces shopping center where a bank , beauty parlor and restaurant are planned . <p> " There 's someone who can help with any interior problems , a management company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Mitchell said . " And there 's no yardwork . " <p> One of the most visible additions to the high-rise landscape is the Phoenix , a 27-story beige building that bears a remarkable resemblance to downtown 's historic Flatiron Building . <p> Inside , there are 65 units , with 2,000 to 5,000 square feet , a heated pool and spa , media room and library , business and fitness centers and a wine cellar . Prices range from $600,000 to $900,000 , with three penthouses priced at $2.4 million . <p> " I like the architecture , the unique look and the feel of the building , " said Phoenix owner John Paulson , who is among the first residents to move in this month . " I 've got a 2,500-square-foot unit on the rounded side of the building with views that are incredible , looking to Buckhead and Stone Mountain . " <p> Paulson , who lived in Alpharetta , also gave living in a high-rise a test run before making the move to the Phoenix 's eighth floor . <p> " I lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I did n't like was being up so high that I felt a little disconnected , " he said . " Here , I 'm a lot lower in the building . " <p> The condominium lifestyle played a big part in his decision as well . As a single professional , he was n't interested in cutting grass , painting or driving far to Buckhead 's nightlife scene . <p> " I looked for a situation that was hands-off , " Paulson said . " And since I enjoy the nightlife , I wanted to be near it . " <p> From the 14th floor of Park Central overlooking the grounds of Piedmont Park , Anita Zervigon-Hakes and her husband , Jay , enjoy one of the city 's most pastoral views without the work . <p> " Being right here in Midtown near the park is just a joy ; it 's like someone takes care of your back yard so you can see the flowers and not have to cut the lawn , " Zervigon-Hakes said . " We 've had big houses and big yards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . It 's nice to come home to this . " <p> Zervigon-Hakes , a professor , and her husband , who heads the Jimmy Carter Library , put their personal touches on a three-bedroom , three-bath unit that came with high-speed Internet access . <p> " That 's one of the wonderful things about a condo unit : There are a lot of services ( like Internet access ) that are available if you share them , " Zervigon-Hakes said . <p> " It 's why you can have a workout room and a heated pool ; if something needs to be fixed , someone can let ( the repair people ) in the door and watch over them . We share that cost whereas an individual homeowner ca n't do that . " <p> Park Central 's prices range from the $150,000s to around $500,000 , but Zervigon-Hakes says it 's hard to put a price on the freedom of living in a high-rise brings . <p> " From our balconies , we watch the sunsets and the city lights at night that sparkle like Christmas trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rainy day and go swimming in the pool and work out . We 're so busy , but we can come home here and watch the world go by . That 's a lot of value . " The terrace on the 11th floor of the Park Central complex , which also overlooks Piedmont Park , is ideal for sunbathers. / RYAN BLAKEY / Staff Photo : Beyond its lobby , the 12-story , Italaniate-style Borghese holds a host of amenities , including a fitness center , guest suites and a clubroom. / RYAN BLAKEY / Staff Photo : Retiree Warren Mitchell and his wife , Mary , are moving from their Buckhead home of 35 years to the Borghese on Northside Parkway. / RYAN BLAKEY / Staff Photo : Among the conveniences that the Mitchells and other residents like about the Borghese is this community pool on the building 's second floor. / RYAN BLAKEY / Staff Graphic : High-rise profiles 1 .
