<p> Don Durborow moves freely between working in his studio and on location , always seeking the details through which he can transform a simple scene into the story of a place . <p> " It 's the detail that pulls people closer to my paintings , " say Don Durborow , a California artist who paints landscapes in acrylic . The stillness and grace in his work engage viewers , who often step in for a better look and find not just the details they sought but the story of the scene . Intrigued , for example , by the crimson bougainvillea in Carmel Mission Bell Tower , viewers who investigate more closely may then see how the patinated stucco walls tell of time 's slow passage under the warm California sun . <p> Durborow 's fascination with detail led to his selection of fast-drying acrylics as a painting medium . Acrylics were relatively new on the market when he resumed his artistic career in the 1970s . As a child in Illinois , Durborow had taken lessons from local artists , and while he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Washington University in St. Louis . He earned a four-year art scholarship to the university , but when World War II erupted , Durborow joined the Air Force and became a fighter pilot . Following the war he married , started a family , and eventually moved to California , where he worked in the aviation industry . After his children were grown and had moved away from home , he started painting again . Before long , he had a number of completed canvases . <p> " I started to wonder , " he recalls , " just what to do with all those paintings . " Gallery director Pam Ludwig provided the answer when she put Durborow 's work in Joan Irvine Smith Fine Arts in Laguna Beach , California , where he was represented until it closed in January 2002 . Now his work hangs in Ludwig 's own gallery , the recently opened Gallery Grace , also in Laguna Beach . <p> The gallery shows Durborow 's pastel still lifes , in addition to his acrylic landscapes . The artist says it 's strictly subject matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenly between the two , starting most of his landscapes en plein air . " Painting outdoors allows me to capture light and color with much greater accuracy , " he notes . He may complete a piece during his first outing or return to the location the next day , but he often finishes paintings in his studio , as he did with Carmel Mission Bell Tower . <p> Durborow especially enjoys the friendly competition and camaraderie of paint-outs , where artists work together on location , and he attends at least four such events a year . Although he may complete two to four works per paint-out , he finds that interacting with other artists in attendance is an equally important part of the experience . He was led to paint-outs by an artist who once suggested that if Durborow was serious about his painting , he should join an art group  --  that learning from others would make him a better painter . It was good advice , says Durborow , who serves on the executive board of the California Art Club , of which he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pastel Society of America , the Society of Western Artists , and the National Acrylic Painters Association ( United Kingdom ) , and he is a past president of the San Gabriel Fine Arts Association . <p> In one memorable paint-out arranged by gallery owner Joan Irvine Smith , Durborow was among 25 artists who worked for a week on a stretch of coastline threatened by impending development . The effort meshed perfectly with his artistic goals to paint , as he says , " the old and nostalgic as a way to record and preserve historic buildings and the landscape , so future generations can see what we have seen and enjoyed . " In that spirit , Durborow created Overlooking Costal Cove . The painting is a testament to the area 's peace and serenity , qualities the artists not only recorded in their paintings but also preserved tangibly , as proceeds from the sale of works helped halt the development of a section of the southern California coast . <p> Of course , working outdoors has its challenges . Last year during a weeklong paint-out sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather was hot and dry every day . By midafternoon , Durborow could n't keep his paints wet enough . " That 's one drawback to acrylics , " he admits , " because setting up is half the work . " In his years of working with the medium , however , he has developed several helpful techniques . " When setting up my palette , first I fold wet paper towels and place them on a disposable palette , " he explains . " Next , I mix the various colors that I will be using and place them on the wet paper towel . Throughout the day , I use a small spray bottle of water to keep the palette damp . " <p> Possibly the most helpful tool for conquering the California climate came to him by way of England . While painting with a British friend , Durborow admired the Daler-Rowney Stay-Wet palette in which his companion stored his sheet of colors . When the friend returned to England , he sent Durborow one of the airtight plastic containers . It features a firm but thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the tray , keeping it humid . " At the end of the day , I place the paper with the paints in the tray , spray it with water , replace the lid , and put the tray in the refrigerator , " Durborow explains . " The next morning , I take the paints out , and I am ready to continue . Since I have the exact colors that I mixed when I started , I can touch up any painting or make changes to it . I can keep my paints for several days this way . " <p> To make the most of his time when working outdoors , Durborow has developed a customized field kit : three cigar boxes that each hold 23 to 26 of the small plastic containers that 35-mm film comes in , every canister filled with a different color . A dab of paint on the lids tells him what is inside , and he adds Liquitex retarding medium to slow the drying time . Typically , his field kit includes several shades of greens , yellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darks , as well as cerulean and ultramarine blues and black and white . <p> Durborow shifts comfortably between the studio and the outdoors , and as a result , whether he is painting in a mountain meadow or in his Fullerton studio , he approaches a canvas the same way . First , he identifies the subject that distinguishes the scene  --  something he finds by instinct rather than analysis  --  or as he puts it , " Something that just says , Wow ! to me . " That core object , however , is not necessarily the ultimate focus of his painting . For instance , for The Fisherman , Nanking , China , the artist notes that although he used the fisherman as a focal point , he mainly wanted to show the variations in texture , style , and color of the houses lining the riverbanks of China . <p> Once he has made a selection , he plans the colors he will use and adds only those to his palette , yet another way to maximize his painting time . " I like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " he states . For plein air work , Durborow uses stretched and gessoed canvases that are no larger than 12 " x 16 " , but in the studio , he goes up to 22 " x 28 " . He then roughs in the composition with charcoal directly on the prepared canvas . " Charcoal wipes off easily if I need to make any adjustments , " he points out . When satisfied , he uses a spray fixative to seal the drawing . <p> Durborow often takes a camera with him for location work . When he is doing a landscape entirely in the studio , however , he does n't rely solely on photos ; sometimes he does n't even get around to developing his film . But for Little Baldy , photos were an aid . He and his wife hiked up to the site , in California 's Sequoia National Park , and on the way to the summit , he stopped to pencil a rough sketch of the scene , take several photographs , and make notes . He combined these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that captures the freshness of that mountain morning . <p> Doing Little Baldy and other works in the studio gives the artist the freedom to mix a separate palette for each area of the painting , providing him with a wider color selection than his field kit offers . Durborow works from the background forward , and each palette serves a separate stage of the painting 's development . For example , for the sky in Little Baldy , he started with white at the top-right corner of the palette , then added a progression of darker colors to the left , including blues , such as Liquitex cerulean . The second palette ( for the snow ) held grays , lavenders , tints of light brown , and shades of lighter blues , as compared with the more intense blues in the sky palette ; and the palette for the trees , rocks , and bare ground was full of greens and browns . The artist employed a No. 00 and No. 2 rounds for the final details , such as the bark on the trees and feathery pine needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brights and flats , as large as Nos. 6 or 8 , which allow him to apply paint thinly . <p> When working in his studio , Durborow swings to the big-band sounds of Glenn Miller or Artie Shaw or show tunes from Broadway musicals he 's seen during trips to New York City . He also finds inspiration in the work of other contemporary artists , such as Howard Terpning , a master of historical detail , and Clark Hulings , whose paintings of rustic locations appeal to Durborow 's love of travel . He and his wife have journeyed throughout Asia ( Singapore , Thailand , Hong Kong , Taiwan , China , and Japan ) as well as across Europe . The artist finds photographs most useful on these forays abroad , when there is n't always time to paint on location . <p> Such was the case with Going Home . The painting portrays a fleeting moment in a Venice alley after a shop-keeper closed up at the end of the day . " Naturally , " he acknowledges , " artists want to paint the canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life in Venice that most artists ignore . " Durborow explored the city 's side streets , and when he came upon this setting , he took three photos and later painted the scene in his home studio . Again , it 's the details that tell the story , but not just of a Venice merchant . The painting also speaks of an artist whose keen eye and interpretation of a simple scene express a deep appreciation for life and an ability to be present in every moment . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Fisherman , Nanking , China , 2000 , acrylic , 18 x 24 .
