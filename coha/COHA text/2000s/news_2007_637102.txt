<p> Tributary at New Manchester in Douglasville is banking on a family-friendly theme that harks back to the mid-1900s , with parks , playgrounds , sports centers , pools and walking trails defining the scene across from Sweetwater State Park . <p> But modern touches are a hit with the 2007 crowd , too , as secure wireless centers are cleverly scattered throughout the neighborhood , allowing folks to use their laptops poolside , courtside and more . <p> When Melissa and Thomas Gillis moved to Tributary last year , they knew they had found something special at " this perfect old-fashioned community , " he says . Later , when they learned that the six-week Street of Dreams home tour would be held here this year starting Saturday , they had to chuckle : They were one step ahead and already living the dream , they said . <p> Thomas says it 's great having a park just steps from their home , especially with 3-year-old son Ashford in tow . " I consider Founders Park my front yard , " Thomas says . " I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a rush to go back in the house . " <p> There 's often a good mix of neighbors strolling around . <p> Pat and Michael Harbin are among them . " We wanted smaller utility bills to achieve a downsizing experience without giving up the interior space we were used to , " Michael says , especially because they often entertain their five grown children and grandchildren . " We accomplished that here , " thanks in part to the fact that all Tributary homes are EarthCraft certified , which means they 're energy efficient . <p> This year 's tour includes nine homes instead of the usual five , with bragging rights for all designs , priced from $599,000 to $1.8 million . <p> Visitors to the Street of Dreams will step onto front porches big enough for entertaining , or relaxing while waving to neighbors .

" There was a need to make the flow work for entertaining , " she said , " while keeping private spaces intimate for times when it 's just the family . " <p> In the " Mayberry " home , inspired by Arts and Crafts design , the impressive details include massive stonework around a fireplace , exposed ceiling beams and wide stairways . <p> Five of the larger homes made the most of western views overlooking Sweetwater Creek , with detailed porches , verandas and other outdoor spaces , many with full kitchens . <p> Inside , visitors may want to pause while checking out meditation rooms , wine cellars , double-chef kitchens , teen and in-law suites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in audiovisual security systems and push-button porch screens that retract . <p> Cameras and videos are allowed on the tour , which is a good way to help remember all the ideas on display .
