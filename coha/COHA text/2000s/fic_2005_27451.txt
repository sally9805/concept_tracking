1 The village was empty . Billy Styles could n't understand it . They had n't seen a living soul on the road from the station , and even the green was deserted , though the weather was the kind that normally brought people out of doors . The finest summer since the war ! The newspapers had been repeating the phrase for weeks now as one radiant day followed another , with no end to the heat wave in sight . But here in Highfield , sunshine lay like a curse on empty cottage gardens . Only the headstones in the churchyard , crowding the moss-covered stone wall flanking the road , gave mute evidence of a human presence . " They 're all at the house , " Boyce said , as though in explanation . He was an inspector with the Surrey police , a thin grey man with an anxious look . " Word got around this morning . " Boyce had come to the station to meet Inspector Madden and Billy . In a chauffeured Rolls Royce , no less ! Billy wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare . With less than three months experience in the CID he knew he was lucky to be there at all , assigned to a case of such magnitude . Only the August bank holiday , combined with the heavy summer-leave schedule , had brought it about . Scotland Yard had been thinly manned that Monday morning when the telephone call came from Guildford . Minutes later Billy had found himself in a taxi with Madden bound for Victoria station . He glanced at the inspector , who was sitting beside him staring out of the car window . Among the lower ranks at the Yard , Madden was reckoned to be a queer one . They had n't met before today , but Billy had , seen him striding down the corridors . A tall grim man with a scarred forehead , he seemed more like a monk than a policeman , the young detective constable thought . An impression that gained strength now each time the inspector 's glance fell on him . Madden 's deep-set eyes seemed to look at you from another world . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madden had left the force some years before after losing his wife and baby daughter , both in the same week , to influenza . The son of a farmer , he had wanted to return to the land . Instead , the war had come , and afterwards he 'd returned to his old job with the Metropolitan Police . Changed , though , it was said . A different man from before . Two years in the trenches had seen to that . They had cleared the village , leaving the last cottage behind . Rounding a bend in the road , the chauffeur braked . Ahead of them , blocking the narrow country lane and facing a set of iron gates , a crowd had gathered . Whole families were there , it seemed , the men in shirtsleeves and braces , the women wearing kitchen aprons and with their hair tied up in scarves and handkerchiefs . Children stood hand in hand , or else played together on the dusty verges . A short way down the road two little girls in coloured smocks were bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said wearily . " We 've asked them to keep away , but what can you expect ? " The chauffeur blew his horn as they drew near and the crowd parted to let the car through . Billy felt the weight of their accusing stares . " They do n't know what to think , " Boyce muttered . " And we do n't know what to tell them . " The drive beyond the gates was lined with elms , linked at their crowns like gothic arches . At the end of it Billy could see a house built of solid stone , clothed in ivy . Melling Lodge was its name . Madden had told him . A family called Fletcher lived there . Had lived there . Billy 's mouth went dry as they approached the gravelled forecourt where a fountain topped by a Cupid figure , standing with his bow drawn , sprayed silvery water into the bright sunlit afternoon . Blue uniforms stirred in the shadows . " We brought a dozen men down from Guildford . " Boyce nodded towards a police van parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want more . " Madden spoke for the first time . " We 'll need to search the land around the house . " " Wait till you see the other side . " Boyce groaned . " Woods . Nothing but woods . Miles and miles of them . " Madden 's glance had shifted to a group of three men standing together in a shaded corner of the forecourt . Two of them wore light country tweeds . The third sweated in a double-breasted serge suit . " Who are they ? " he asked . " The old boy 's Lord Stratton . Local nob . He owns most of the land hereabouts . That 's the Lord Lieutenant with him . Major General Sir William Raikes . " " What 's he doing here ? " Madden scowled . " He was a weekend guest at Stratton Hall , worst luck . " Boyce pulled a face . " He 's been raising merry hell , I can tell you . The other one 's Chief Inspector Norris , from Guildford . " As Madden opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striding across the gravel . " About time , " he said angrily . " Sinclair , is it ? " " No , Sir William . Madden 's the name . Detective Inspector . This is Detective Constable Styles . Chief Inspector Sinclair is on his way . He 'll be here shortly . " Madden 's glance roamed the forecourt . " Well , for God 's sake ! " Raikes fumed . " What 's keeping the man ? " " He 's getting a team together . Pathologist , fingerprint squad , photographer ... " The inspector made no attempt to disguise his impatience . " It takes time , particularly on a bank holiday . " " Indeed ! " Raikes glared at him , but Madden was already turning away to greet the older man , who had joined them . " Lord Stratton ? Thank you for sending the car , sir . " " It was nothing . How else can I help you , Inspector ? " He held out his hand to Madden , who shook it . His face showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you need any transport ? I 've a runabout at the Hall . You 're welcome to use it . " " Would you mention that to Mr. Sinclair ? I 'm sure he 'll be happy to accept . " " Now see here , Madden ! " Raikes tried to force himself back into the conversation , but the inspector ignored him and went on speaking to Lord Stratton . " There 's something I need to know . The woods behind the house , do they belong to you ? " " Upton Hanger ? Yes , the ridge extends for several miles . " He seemed eager to help . " I keep a pheasant shoot over by the Hall " - he pointed in the direction of the village- " but this side the woods run wild . " " What 's your policy on trespassing ? " " Well , technically it 's private property . But the villagers have always had the run of the woods . Over on this side , at least . " " Would you change that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask the police to enforce it . " " I understand . " Stratton frowned . " Better to keep people away . " " I was thinking of the London press . They 'll be here soon enough . " " Boyce ! " Chief Inspector Norris spoke . " I 'll see to it , sir . " " One other thing . " Madden drew Lord Stratton aside . " There 's a crowd of villagers outside the gates . Could you speak to them ? Tell them what 's happened here . There 's no point in keeping it a secret . Then ask them to go home . We 'll be questioning them later . But they 're no help to us standing out there blocking the road . " " Of course . I 'll see to that now . " He set off up the drive . Watching , Billy could only marvel . How did Madden do it ? He was n't a nob himself , that much was certain . There was a rough unpolished air about the inspector that set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he talked , they listened ! Even Sir William Whatsit , who could only stand there glowering . " Chief Inspector , " still ignoring Raikes , Madden turned to Norris , " could we have a word ? " He moved away , and after a moment 's hesitation Norris joined him . The Guildford chief was red in the face and sweating heavily in his thick suit . " I 'll need some details , sir . " " Speak to Boyce . " Norris blinked rapidly . " Good God , man ! You ca n't treat a lord lieutenant that way . " Madden regarded him without expression . Norris opened his mouth to speak again , then changed his mind . He spun on his heel and rejoined Raikes , who stood with his back ostentatiously turned to them , glaring up the drive at the retreating figure of Lord Stratton . Madden nodded to Boyce and led the way out of the forecourt around to the side of the house . When they came into a pool of shade he paused and took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , lit up himself . " I was told four in the house . " The inspector was speaking to Boyce . " That 's right . " The Surrey inspector took out a handkerchief . " Colonel and Mrs. Fletcher . One of the maids , Sally Pepper , and the children 's nanny , Alice Crookes . " " Who found the bodies ? " " The other maid , Ellen Brown . We have n't talked to her yet . She 's in hospital in Guildford . Under sedation . " He wiped his face . " Brown returned this morning . Mrs. Fletcher had given her the weekend off-Saturday and Sunday-but she was due back last night , and the other maid , Pepper , was to have had today off . Brown missed her train-she 's got a young man in Birmingham-and only arrived this morning . She was seen passing through the village , running from the station , looking to be in trouble with her mistress , I dare say . Half an hour later she was back again , not making much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Madden drew on his cigarette . Boyce shrugged . " I do n't know what she did when she found them . Fainted , I would guess . But she had enough sense to get herself to the local bobby . He lives at this end of the village . Constable Stackpole . He did n't know what to think-whether to believe her , even . He said she was raving . So he got on his bicycle and pedalled like blazes . He rang Guildford from the Lodge . I was the duty officer and I informed Chief Inspector Norris and he rang the chief constable who decided to call in the Yard right away . " " When did you get here ? " " Just before midday . Mr. Norris and I. " " You went through the house ? " Boyce nodded . " We did n't touch anything . Then Sir William arrived with Lord Stratton . " " Did they go inside ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Both of them ? " Boyce looked shamefaced . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't stay long . It was getting to be ripe inside . The heat , you know ... " " Anyone else ? " " Only the doctor . " " The police surgeon ? " " No , Stackpole could n't raise him-he lives in Godalming-so he rang the village doctor . " " What time did he get here ? " " She . " Boyce glanced up from his notebook . " Dr. Blackwell 's a woman . " Madden was frowning . " Yes , I know . " Boyce shrugged . " But it could n't be helped . There was no one else . " " Was she able to cope ? " " As far as I can tell . Stackpole said she did what was necessary , confirmed they were all dead . It was she who found the little girl . " He consulted his notebook . " Sophy Fletcher , aged five . Apparently she 's a patient of the doctor 's . " " The child was in the house ? " " Hiding under her bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Boyce looked away , biting his lip . Madden waited for a moment . " You said children . ' " " There 's a son , James , aged ten . He 's been spending a few weeks with his uncle in Scotland . Lucky , I suppose , if you can call it that . " " Do we know if the girl witnessed the murders ? " Boyce shook his head . " She has n't said a word since Dr. Blackwell found her . The shock , I imagine . " " Where is she now ? " " At the doctor 's house . It 's not far . I sent an officer over there . " " We must get her into hospital in Guildford . " Madden killed his cigarette on the sole of his shoe and put the stub in his pocket . Billy , watching , followed suit . " Any idea of time of death ? " " Dr. Blackwell says between eight and ten last night-based on rigor . Could n't have been before seven . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the village . I 've had a word with her , but she could n't tell us much . She fixed them a cold meal , then took herself off . Did n't notice anything unusual . Did n't see anyone hanging about . " Boyce glanced back towards the drive . " The gates were open . They could have driven in . " " They ? " " Has to be more than one man . " Boyce looked at him . " Wait till you see inside . Most likely a gang . There 's stuff been taken . Silver . Jewellery . But why they had to- " He broke off , shaking his head . " How did they get into the house ? " " They broke in from the garden side . Come on , I 'll show you . " Boyce led the way to the front of the house , out of the shade on to the sunwashed terrace . It was late afternoon , past four o'clock but the cloudless summer sky held hours of daylight yet . Shallow steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fishpond in the middle . Further on another set of steps led to a lower level bordered by a shrubbery . Where the garden ended the woods of Upton Hanger began , rising like a green wave , filling the horizon . " See ! They smashed in the french windows . " Boyce pointed . " They 're not cracksmen . Not professionals . " One of a pair of tall glassed doors at the front of the house had been knocked off its hinges . The empty frame lay across the doorway . Broken glass glittered in the sunlight . Madden crouched down to examine it . In the silence Billy heard the sound of flies buzzing . It came from inside the house . He wrinkled his nose at the rotten-sweet smell . " We ca n't leave ' em there much longer , " Boyce observed . He watched Madden with narrowed eyes . " Not in this heat . There 's a mortuary wagon standing by in the village . Should I bring it up to the house ? " " Better wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can begin fingerprinting , though . Start with the people who 've been in the house . " A grin replaced the anxious frown on Boyce 's face . " Does that include the Lord Lieutenant and Lord Stratton ? " " Certainly . " " Sir William told Mr. Norris they had n't touched anything . " " I 'm sure he did . Print them both . " Madden glanced at Billy . " Constable ? " " Sir ? " Billy straightened automatically . " We 'll go inside now . "
