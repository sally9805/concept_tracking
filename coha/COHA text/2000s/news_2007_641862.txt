<p> THE MOTLEY FOOL 'S TAKE <p> COSTCO DELIVERS BULK JOY <p> Discounter 's a gem , but no bargain <p> People may be jittery about the health of the consumer , but Costco ( Nasdaq : COST ) is going against that grain , judging by its most recent quarterly results . <p> Fourth-quarter net income at Costco increased nearly 5 percent to $372.4 million , excluding a non-recurring charge . Costco 's revenues increased 3 percent to $20.09 billion . In a particularly bright spot , Costco 's sales for the quarter at stores open more than a year increased 5 percent , which seems like a significant achievement given recent nervousness about the retail sector . <p> Many people are worried about how consumers will fare , given the increasingly scary housing slowdown . Yet it 's arguable that discounters such as Costco , Target and Wal-Mart can lure customers with low prices . Like Target , Costco has the added benefit of attracting a more affluent customer who is more likely to pursue bargains in tough times , yet wo n't feel the pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute for investors . <p> Costco is a solid , well-run <p> long-term buy . But unfortunately , it does n't look particularly cheap right now . Investors might do best to add the company to their watch list and wait for some temporary pessimism to deflate the share price . <p> FOOL 'S SCHOOL <p> PICKING MUTUAL FUNDS <p> Choosing mutual funds based solely on recent performance can be a recipe for bad performance . Here are some things to think about . <p> Funds that beat the stock market average one year wo n't necessarily beat it the following year . To some degree , a terrific return is n't the result of the fund manager 's brilliance , but of good luck  --  at least over the short term . ( And many fund managers invest only for the short term . ) Many bad funds have occasional outstanding years . <p> If a fund has a great three- , five- or even 10-year average , that can be due to one amazing year . After all , a five-year average is just an average of five numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be high . If in each of five years , a fund earns 6 percent , 11 percent , 2 percent , 8 percent and 33 percent , its average annual return will be about 12 percent . That might look respectable , but note that in reality it exceeded 12 percent in only one of five years . That 33 percent return ( a statistical " outlier " ) skewed the average . <p> Believe it or not , the majority of stock mutual funds fail to perform as well as the market average ( as measured by the S &P; 500 index ) . <p> So what can you do ? Well , consider investing in a broad-market index fund . If you ca n't beat the average , you can meet it ( and outperform most other mutual funds ) by investing in an index fund such as Vanguard 's S &P; 500 index fund ( ticker : VFINX ) or its Total Stock Market index fund ( ticker : VTSMX ) . ( Vanguard is at www.vanguard.com or ( 800 ) 662-7447 . ) To do even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than average consistently . Ideally , they 'll have no loads , expense ratios below 1 percent , and thoughtful managers who invest their own money in the funds . <p> Learn more about mutual funds at www.funds.fool.com and research them at www.morningstar.com .

The company released one fluff-filled press release after another , which always sounded like it was ready to turn a corner . I also bought into some of the pump-and-dumpers hyping the stock online . I learned some expensive lessons . Do n't take advice from morons , and if it looks too good to be true , then it probably is . Doing your due diligence is important . The company is a complete disaster and on its way to bankruptcy . <p>  --  Chris S. , Grove City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous because <p> they often have no track record <p> of growing sales and profits . They can also often be easily manipulated by folks who buy them , hype them online ( " pumping " ) so their price rises as others pile on , and then sell the stock ( " dumping " ) quickly , causing it to crash . It 's usually smart to avoid stocks trading for less than $5 per share . Instead , look for consistent growers with low debt , strong cash flow , talented management and competitive advantages . <p> NAME THAT COMPANY <p> Send your answer to us with Foolish Trivia on the top and you 'll be entered into a drawing for a nifty prize ! <p> - I was founded in 1937 , after Vernon Rudolph bought a doughnut shop and recipe from a French chef . <p> - I 'm based in Winston-Salem , N.C. , today . <p> - My more-than-400 stores in 41 states and several nations make more than 3 million doughnuts per day . <p> - The sprinkles I use each year would fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can see my Hot Original Glazed doughnuts being made behind glass walls . <p> - I went public in 2000 , and my performance has foundered lately . <p> - My stock has fallen from the $40s to below $5 . <p> WHO AM I ? <p> LAST WEEK <p> - I 'm a global giant , reeling in some $6 billion in sales annually . <p> - Brands in my big plastic bin include Sharpie , Paper Mate , DYMO , EXPO , Waterman , Parker , Rolodex , IRWIN Vise-Grip , Shur-Line , LENOX , BernzOmatic , Graco , Calphalon , Levolor and Goody .

They study possible investments and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or sell . Sell-side analysts traditionally work for brokerages , trying to sell their ideas to institutions . If an institution likes a brokerage 's research , it might do business with that brokerage . <p> Many brokerages now offer us investors access to sell-side analysts ' research reports on various companies . <p> Should I hold or sell a stock I bought near its all-time high ? <p>  --  P.W. , Las Vegas <p> The price you paid for the stock is important when you sell it and calculate your gain ( or loss ) for tax purposes . But most of the time , do n't think about it too much . What really matters is the current price and your estimate of the stock 's true fair price . <p> For example , imagine you bought shares of Whoa Nellie Brake Co. ( ticker : HALTT ) for $50 each , and they 're now trading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40 , you should probably hang on . If you think they 're worth less than $30 , selling might be best . Ignore the fact that you 're down $20 per share . If you 'd bought the shares for $10 each , you 'd be up $20 per share , but your thinking should be the same  --  hang on if you think more growth is ahead , and sell if you expect the shares to falter . <p> Never hang on to a stock just in the hope of recouping your losses . You can always try to make your money back in another stock , perhaps one in which you have much more confidence . <p> WRITE TO US ! <p> Send questions for Ask the Fool and entries for Dumbest ( or Smartest ) Investments ( up to 100 words ) and trivia to Fool@fool.com or via mail to Motley Fool , 123 N.
