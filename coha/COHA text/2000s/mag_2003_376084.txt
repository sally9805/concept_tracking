Nine months after being forced to step down as Senate majority leader , Trent Lott is back . And he 's taking swings at George W. Bush , the President whose strong condemnation of Lott 's racially insensitive remarks at the late Strom Thurmond 's birthday party helped precipitate Lott 's demotion . In June the Mississippi conservative voted against a Medicare prescription-drug bill the President had urged Republican Senators to support . Earlier this month he publicly warned Bush that he had to give Americans more details on postwar-Iraq plans . And last week he joined Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan in a resolution to overturn another White House  --  backed measure , the Federal Communications Commission 's decision to relax media-ownership caps . <P> " He has really found his niche , " says a friend . " He recognizes you do n't have to have the top power seat in the Senate to be extremely powerful . " Lott has breathed life into the dormant Senate Rules and Administration Committee , whose chairmanship he got as a consolation prize after being deposed . He has used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate 's filibuster rules and the laws on presidential succession . And he could become a pest when Bush seeks approval for his $87 billion request for postwar Iraq . While Lott has told Bush aides he will support the request , he says , " I do n't like this kind of huge expenditure . They 've got to explain it better . " <P> Lott insists that his pokes at Bush are n't payback . " Look , I 'm here , " he told TIME . " And I 'm going to try to be helpful . Sometimes that will get me crossed up with the Administration . " But he added , " I am sending the signal that they 're going to have to deal with me , and they need to keep that in mind , because I can be a problem . " The Senator could settle some scores in the fall of next year , when his memoirs are scheduled to be published . The book will include a chapter on Republican Senators ( he wo n't reveal any names yet ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out , as well as on Administration officials who were " undermining me.
