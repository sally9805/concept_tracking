I try not to think of that morning in May of this year of 1851 . It is muddled in my brain anyway , maybe because I choose to leave it muddled . I did not see it all , I tell myself . I was upstairs in my room in our rambling white farmhouse , sent upstairs by Papa because I sassed Aunt Susan Elizabeth . She was Papa 's aunt , getting on in years and in grouchiness . She drove me to distraction and I would have given anything to be away from her , from that house , yes , even from Papa , who had few words of cheerfulness for me since the day I was born and fewer yet since he 'd become involved with his abolitionist doings , which seemed like forever now . He went about those doings with an obsession . There was always a quilt on the front wooden fence to show we were a safe house for runaways . I know because I put them there for Aunt Susan Elizabeth . We had five of those quilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quilts said things . Each one had a different message . What , I do n't know because I could never quite learn the differences . It had to do with the square knots left visible on the front , which Aunt Susan Elizabeth said was usually the sign of shoddy workmanship . But not with these quilts . These square knots were left on the front on purpose . The quilts each had a set number of square knots . She must have explained to me a dozen times the many things those knots meant . But I never got it . Which made her call me " dense . " I hated those quilts because I was always having to work on one . That morning I was working on a wagon wheel pattern , which Aunt Susan Elizabeth said signaled the slaves to pack everything that would go into a wagon or that could be used in transit . " Why ca n't they just be told ? " I asked her . It was n't so much the words I said as how I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " No soul , " he said to me , " you 've got no soul . For this your mother gave her life when you were born . No soul . " He 'd been saying a lot of things like that to me lately , because I refused to get involved with his abolitionist doings . I could n't understand him risking his life for all those negroes who came to our door in the middle of the night looking like something the cat dragged in . Two nights before he 'd taken in two runaways from the Harris plantation in Buckstown , Maryland , a state part slave and part free . They 'd had enough of old Mr. Josiah Harris 's cruelty . We live in the small town of Christiana , Pennsylvania , on the Maryland border . My name is Cecelia McGill . Papa 's name is John . Runaway negroes know we 're a station on the Underground Railroad . It was a bright morning , about ten o'clock . I was sitting on my bed , wondering how long I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I went to look out the window . It was Mr. Harris and he had his two mangy sons with him . I pushed the window open so I could hear . Harris was waving around a paper , which apparently was some kind of a writ . " Signed under the new Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 , McGill , " I heard him yell . " Gives me the right to cross over into another state and pursue and take back the runaways . " My father said something ; I did n't hear what . The Harrises got off their horses and headed for the house . I heard my father tell them to wait outside , then he must have come in and gone to the secret hiding place under the parlor and brought the slaves up , because he 's nothing if not a law-abiding man , my father . He brought them outside . Then more men rode up . I recognized the Wallers , Quakers from the area . More trouble . I do n't know why people have to force their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice them and leave others alone . Right off the Quakers started with the thees and thous , challenging the legality of the whole thing . An argument started . It got loud . Soon there was pushing and shoving . One of the Harrises ? red his gun in the air . The horses jumped and got antsy . Then more guns went off . It all happened very fast . And of a sudden I saw my papa fall on the ground and the Harrises mount their horses and gallop away and the Quakers mount their horses , and for all their thees and thous pay no attention to my father but take the slaves on the horses behind them and whisk them off . Likely in the direction of the next safe house and on to Canada . And I , who have no soul , went downstairs to see if my father was alive or dead .
