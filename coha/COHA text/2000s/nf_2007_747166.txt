What keeps a mother 's immune system from treating her baby as foreign tissue ? A new theory resolves the paradox . <p> Why did n't your mother reject you ? I do n't mean psychologically , but immunologically . That may still sound like a strange question , but think about what happens when a mother conceives a child . Each baby has a mother and a father , and as a result carries a mix of genetic material from both parents . The father 's genetic material is foreign to the mother . Normally when the immune system encounters something within the body that is foreign ( " non-self " ) , it attacks and eliminates the outsider . So why does n't the mother 's immune system reject the developing embryo as a foreign body , just as it would reject a thorn , a virus , or a tissue graft from another person ? . <p> More than fifty years ago the Nobel prize  --  winning English transplant-immunologist Peter B. Medawar posed what has become known as the " immunological paradox of pregnancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semiforeign transplant , because half of its genes come from the father . Therefore , he concluded , the mother 's immune system and the fetus must be locked in conflict . Subsequent studies showed that the immune system is indeed active at the site where the developing embryo attaches to the uterus , or " implants , " at the beginning of pregnancy . Thus an aggressive maternal immune system , it seemed , would take to the ramparts against the embryo , which further implied that the embryo in turn would need to take evasive or defensive measures . Medawar 's way of posing the problem still dominates current thinking about the immunology of pregnancy , though exactly how the fetal cells evade maternal surveillance is a matter of debate . <p> In 2004 I was in Japan to deliver a talk on the immunology of pregnancy . In preparing for the talk , I began reviewing data showing that removing natural killer cells , a kind of immune-system cell , from certain strains of pregnant mice causes the mice to miscarry . Those findings were the exact opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view : If the immune system is a threat to the embryo , you would think that getting rid of the immune-system cells that kill an invader would help the pregnancy succeed . <p> That 's when I had a classic " aha " moment . I realized that those results were similar to the ones that I and my colleagues had obtained a couple of years before with macrophages , another kind of immune-system cell . We had discovered that removing macrophages also harmed the pregnancy . At that time we could not explain those results , but they had been " sleeping " in the back of my mind ever since . <p> In the three years since my " aha " moment , I have developed a new perspective on the way the mother 's immune system and the fetus interact . Although there clearly is a mechanism that prevents the mother 's immune system from treating the fetus as a foreign body , I think conventional wisdom has the role of the mother 's immune system completely backwards . Rather than threatening the fetus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pregnancy , particularly in its early stages . <p> Colored MRI image shows a human fetus near term , its head downward against the birth canal of its mother and its umbilical cord running roughly left-to-right just above the center of the image . A fetus carries a mix of genetic material from both parents in its genome . According to the general rules of immunology , the mother 's immune system should reject her fetus as foreign ( " non-self " ) the way it would a tissue graft from another person , raising what is known as the " immunological paradox of pregnancy . " <p> To appreciate how the early fetal cells can cooperate with the immune system of the mother , recall what happens after a sperm fertilizes an egg . The fertilized egg rapidly divides to form the blastocyst , a hollow ball of cells with an inner cell mass and outer layer . The inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo , which develops into a fetus about eight weeks after conception , when the major organs of the future baby become recognizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trophoblast . The trophoblast cells invade the lining of the uterus and ' thereby begin implantation . <p> Within a few weeks of making its home in the uterus , the trophoblast further transforms into the fetal part of the placenta , the conduit for the passage of nutrients and oxygen from mother to fetus . ( Some of the mother 's cells form a second part of the mature placenta . ) <p> The immune system eliminates invaders in two ways . The first , known as the innate immune response , neutralizes invading pathogens before they can harm the body . In a wound , for example , white blood cells known as macrophages engulf invading microorganisms and also release signaling proteins called cytokines . The signals activate other parts of the immune system , such as natural killer cells , which gobble up everything foreign in their path . This response requires no prior exposure to the invader . <p> Acquired immunity is an additional , highly specific , and generally more sophisticated response . It relies on antibodies and specialized white blood cells called B cells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body has already been exposed . Those immune-system cells become active and multiply if they encounter molecules or parts of molecules called antigens associated with foreign organisms . The immune-system cells " remember " their encounter with those specific antigens and react to further exposures faster and more vigorously . <p> In 1991 Gail T. Colbern of the Medical Research Institute in San Francisco and Elliott K. Main , now at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco , redefined the conceptual framework of reproductive immunology . The trophoblast cells , they realized , are the only part of the differentiating blastocyst that interacts directly with the mother 's immune system . The embryo itself  --  and the fetus to which the embryo gives rise  --  has no direct contact with maternal immune cells . As a result , Colbern and Main argued , the real puzzle is not why the mother 's immune system tolerates the ferns , but why it tolerates the trophoblast cells . <p> Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the mother 's tolerance , including : <p>  --  first , that the trophoblast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the mother 's immune system is suppressed during pregnancy ; <p>  --  third , that the mother 's immune system is suppressed , but only locally , in the vicinity of the trophoblast ; and <p>  --  fourth , that the balance of cytokines , the proteins that regulate the mother 's immune response , shifts during pregnancy . <p> Although some of those hypotheses are more widely accepted than others , each still attracts its fair share of proponents . After my " aha " moment in Japan three years ago , I started thinking more critically about each of them , and noticing their flaws . <p> According to the first hypothesis , a mechanical barrier prevents cells from moving in either direction between mother and fetus . Thus the barrier creates a state of " immunologic ignorance " : antigens inside the barrier are never detected by the immune system without . I do n't find that explanation convincing , because studies indicate the placenta is not as impermeable as originally envisioned . <p> In 1996 , for instance , investigators at Harvard and Tufts universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detected fetal cells in mothers ' bodies decades after pregnancy . Furthermore , the fetal cells could infiltrate maternal tissues and differentiate into liver , blood , skin , and other cell types . Originally , it was thought that such fetal cells in the mothers caused many of the autoimmune diseases that afflict women . <p> But in 2002 , Tufts investigators demonstrated that the fetal cells may play a critical role in repairing a mother 's damaged tissue . In one case , a woman suffering from hepatitis , a serious liver disease , stopped her treatment against medical advice . Surprisingly , she recovered . Her own body could not regenerate healthy liver cells , so the investigators were baffled . When they tested a specimen of her liver , though , they discovered it incorporated thousands of male cells still left in her circulation from a pregnancy nearly two decades before her illness . Those leftover fetal cells had generated new liver cells , and thereby saved the mother 's life . What a nice way for a child to repay its mother 's dedication ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second hypothesis , pregnancy involves a state of systemic immune suppression . But I find that hard to believe , too , particularly from an evolutionary point of view . When our ancestors were walking through the forest , they did not always wash their hands or clean their food before serving dinner . And they were continuously exposed to bacteria , parasites , and other microorganisms . If pregnant women were immunologically suppressed , they would have died within hours of exposure to those pathogens , and the human species would have been wiped out . Even today in many parts of the world pregnant women are constantly exposed to harsh , unsanitary conditions . A suppressed immune system would make it impossible for a mother and her fetus to survive . <p> In particular , if the mother 's immune system were suppressed during pregnancy , every pregnant woman infected with HIV would die of AIDS , and that is not the case . In places where the disease is pandemic , such as Africa , women do not die of AIDS during pregnancy ; in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to develop into full-blown AIDS during pregnancy . The immune forces that the trophoblast has called to its aid keep the virus at bay . <p> According to the third hypothesis , local immune suppression , the mother 's immune-system ceils that would ordinarily attack the " foreign " ceils of the trophoblast are prevented from doing so . One proposed mechanism is that the attacking cells are simply removed by the mother 's T regulatory cells . A second proposed mechanism is that a protein secreted by the trophoblast cells , known as Fas ligand protein ( FasL ) , binds to another protein on the mother 's would-be attacker cells called Fas . The binding induces programmed cell death of the would-be attacker cell . <p> But the results of my studies have been the opposite of what one would expect if either of those mechanisms accounted for the mother 's tolerance of the trophoblast . First , recall that in the studies that inspired my " aha " moment , removing immune-system cells ( macrophages ) that would be expected to attack the trophoblast caused pregnant mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others have confirmed , have shown that mice lacking either Fas or FasL protein can reproduce with no apparent complications of pregnancy . <p> The fourth hypothesis maintains that the balance of cytokines in the mothers body shifts during pregnancy , thereby changing the details of her immune response . When a woman is not pregnant , her immune system responds to infection with an arm of the immune system dominated by cytolytic T cells . These cells are mobilized to destroy the cells that have become infected . According to the cytokine-shift hypothesis , however , pregnancy changes the balance , suppressing the inflammatory response and creating , instead , an anti-inflammatory environment . <p> The cytokine-shift hypothesis , also known as the anti-inflammatory theory of pregnancy , was embraced enthusiastically when it was first proposed in 1993 . Numerous studies measured cytokine levels in the mother 's blood , in an effort to prove that pregnancy is an anti-inflammatory condition . Investigators also looked for evidence that a shift toward higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines would lead to miscarriage or to other complications of pregnancy . Some studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's blood , but other studies did not . <p> My own theory grows out of an attempt to understand those contradictory results . In my view , the contradiction is only apparent , and can be traced to an oversimplification . In the studies of inflammation , the entire pregnancy was evaluated as a single event . In reality , though , pregnancy has several chapters , each one marked by the way the mother feels . I believe that , depending on the stage , pregnancy is a pro- or anti-inflammatory condition . <p> In the first trimester , the mother 's body treats implantation as if it were an open wound that requires a strong inflammatory response . After all , to implant itself in the wall of the uterus , the embryo has to break through the uterine lining , damage the underlying tissue , and disrupt the mother 's blood vessels to secure an adequate blood supply . All those activities require an inflammatory response from the mother to secure the adequate repair of the uterus and the removal of dying cells . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling to adapt to the presence of the fetus . Yet without her immune reaction , the pregnancy will not " take . " <p> The second trimester of pregnancy is , in many ways , the best time for the mother . The period is one of growth and development . Both mother and fetus reach a symbiotic stage that is anti-inflammatory : now that the " wound " is healed , the inflammation has died down . The woman no longer suffers from nausea and fever as she did in the first trimester . <p> In the third trimester the fetus completes its development . All its organs become functional and ready to deal with the external world . Now the mother , needs to deliver the baby . And delivery , too , is achieved through inflammation : an influx of the mother 's immune-system cells into the uterus provokes the release of hormones that induce labor , or contractions of the uterus . The contractions expel , or deliver , the baby . <p> In analyzing the flaws in the four earlier hypotheses , I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Medawar , immunologists have viewed the placenta  --  or its precursor , the trophoblast  --  as a " piece of skin " marked with the father 's proteins . But the assumption shared by all four hypotheses  --  that the mother must somehow be tolerating a half-foreign graft  --  has never been convincingly proved . Instead , by proceeding from an unproved assumption , the hypotheses have deepened the confusion about the role of the immune system during pregnancy . <p> The placenta is more than just a transplanted piece of skin . From an evolutionary perspective , that is hardly surprising . Pregnancy and implantation , after all , have been taking place ever since the development of the mammalian uterus more than 180 million years ago see " The Birth of the Uterus , " by Vincent J. Lynch and Gnter P. Wagner , December 2005/January 2006 . The real surprise would be to find that the mother 's immune system had not learned to recognize her own offspring . <p> My research suggests that the trophoblast and the mother 's immune system join forces to fight their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " call for help , " the mother 's immune system responds with coordinated actions . In short , the mother 's immune system becomes active in the early stages of her pregnancy to protect , not to harm , the embryo , to promote implantation and subsequent embryonic growth . <p> To picture how such a complex physiological partnership can function , think of the cells of the mother 's immune system as musicians in an orchestra . The macrophages are one section , the T cells another , the natural killer cells a third . During pregnancy , our studies suggest , the trophoblast functions as a guest conductor . The success of the pregnancy  --  the musical performance  --  depends on how well the trophoblast communicates with each kind of cell in the immune system , and on how well they all work together , I am trying to understand how that orchestra works at the molecular level : how the trophoblast recognizes what is nearby , and , on the basis of that information , what kinds of signals it sends that coordinate cellular activities at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) implants in the lining of the uterus ( schematic diagram ) , provoking an inflammation response from the mother . According to the author 's theory , outlined in the enlarged area of the schematic diagram ( right ) , the trophoblast ( blue ) coordinates the local actions of the mother 's immune-system cells ( purple ) , via signaling proteins called cytokines . Three steps of that coordinated immune response to a foreign body ( antigen ) are shown : ( 1 ) Toll-like receptors on trophoblast cells and on the macrophages of the mother sense the antigen. ( 2 ) The activated trophoblast cells signal the mother 's macrophages and her T regulatory cells via cytokines about the nature of the threat ; the macrophages and the T regulatory cells also coordinate their activities via cytokine signals . ( 3 ) The macrophages destroy the invader and signal the mother 's natural killer cells to suppress their activity , while the activated . T regulatory cells suppress the cytolytic T cells . The two suppressive actions prevent an attack by the mother 's immune system on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trophoblast share a feature with macrophages and other kinds of cells that make up the innate immune system . They all have signal receivers known as Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) displayed on their cell membranes . TLRs enable trophoblast cells to sense bacteria , viruses , dead maternal cells ( killed during implantation ) , and damaged tissue in the trophoblast environment . Before our studies , only immune cells were thought to have TLRs . <p> When the trophoblast , through its TLRs , senses one of those targets , it secretes a specific set of cytokines that act on each kind of immune cell present at the implantation site see illustration above . The cytokine signals " educate " the immune cells , conferring specific properties on them that enable them to help with implantation . For example , in response to the signals , natural killer cells help transform the mother 's blood vessels , macrophages help the blastocyst migrate to the uterine wall , and dendritic cells help in attaching the blastocyst . <p> A particularly important part of cytokine-mediated " education " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trophoblast invades the uterus , it sends out signals that program the death of some uterine cells , to make room for the blastocyst . The dead uterine cells need to be removed quickly or disease will result in the mother . The trophoblast cells signal the macrophages to come and clean up the dead-cell mess . <p> At the same time , cytokines from trophoblast cells signal T regulatory cells to suppress the normal actions of natural killer cells and cytolytic T cells . By suppressing those cells , the trophoblast avoids being attacked by the mother 's immune system . Macrophages " educated " by the trophoblast , on encountering an antigen , signal the T regulatory cells to suppress the natural killer cells for the same reason . <p> All that exquisitely synchronized activity can be derailed by viral or bacterial infection . Clinical studies have shown that infections cause as much as 40 percent of incidence of preterm labor . Furthermore , of the most severe cases of preterm delivery ( pregnancies that end after less than thirty weeks of gestation ) , 80 percent show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity and pregnancy . Inflammation from infection often complicates a pregnancy , jeopardizing the well-being of the mother and her developing embryo . Nature 's solution is harsh : to save the mother , the infection not only causes inflammation , but also triggers early delivery , or miscarriage . The conundrum is that inflammation is also necessary for normal implantation . How can such diametrically opposing outcomes both originate from an inflammatory response ? <p> To our surprise , my research group discovered that the signals triggering miscarriage may be initiated by the same guest conductor , the trophoblast . If a virus , say , is infecting the uterus , the trophoblast recognizes the virus through its TLRs , just as in normal implantation the trophoblast recognizes dead cells from the mother 's uterus . With the virus , however , the trophoblast 's response is different . Its cells signal the mother 's immune-system ceils to mount an aggressive immune response . Instead of suppressing her cytolytic T cells and natural killer cells , she activates them . Not only do they attack the infection , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then expelled ; the mother miscarries . <p> Even though too many bacteria in the upper reproductive tract can lead to miscarriage , some bacteria may be needed to stimulate the mother 's initial inflammatory response . The upper reproductive tract , which includes the inside of the uterus , was once thought to be a sterile environment . It is now known , however , to be continuously exposed to microorganisms . They can reach the uterus either as hitchhikers carried along by sperm or via the peristaltic waves of orgasm . We are currently exploring the possibility that bacteria play an essential role in priming the uterus for implantation . <p> How could they do so ? During the critical time the embryo can implant , adhesion molecules on the uterine lining change their adhesive strength so that the blastocyst can become attached . Those changes of adhesiveness are thought to be induced by semen . It is possible that bacteria help spread the semen across the uterine lining , providing the pro-inflammatory stimuli needed for the blastocyst to attach . Bacteria may therefore be essential for implantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an alternative perspective on the role of the mother 's innate immune system in pregnancy . I would hope that some day my model will lead to early diagnosis and more effective treatment of obstetrical conditions in which the immune system plays a central role . In particular , understanding how the maternal immune system interacts with the trophoblast will enable medical investigators to develop new tests to monitor alterations in the normal cytokine balance that could lead to pregnancy complications . New therapies might also be developed to treat such complications of pregnancy as preeclampsia and recurrent , multiple miscarriages . <p> Preeclampsia accounts for 40 percent of maternal deaths in many countries of the developing world . It is known to be caused by inflammatory conditions that damage the mother 's blood vessels . Unexplained multiple miscarriages probably also result from immune-system disorders . Both those killers , and others , are likely to continue causing heartbreak and devastation until biologists can disentangle the intricate strands of the immunology of pregnancy . <p> To find Web links related to this article , visit **25;1724;TOOLONG and click " Online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally " May 2007 .
