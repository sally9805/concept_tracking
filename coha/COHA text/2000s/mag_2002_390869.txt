// TURN ON TO TODAY 'S BLENDERS Blenders are one of the most versatile small kitchen appliances ever designed . They are a necessity for cooks across the board-from dessert chefs creating a delicate raspberry sauce to college students whipping up a batch of frozen margaritas . Blenders are a staple on bridal registries . You may even remember your first blender-and you certainly remember the first time you turned it on without the lid . Blenders are indispensable for otherwise difficult tasks , such as pureeing cooked vegetables into soups and making fruit smoothies . And operating a blender is very straightforward-put food in , turn blender on . However , as with most appliances , over the years the blender has gone from a basic one-step , two-speed gadget to a high-speed , high-option , high-tech appliance . Although simple models are still available , consumers now have a wealth of choices and features to consider . But are more choices better ?
