The fate of Christians , the fate of a country <p> The old man standing outside Brooklyn 's Maronite cathedral after Sunday liturgy is just back from a visit to his native Lebanon . His face is grim , his tone close to desolate . " It 's over for the Christians there , " he says . " There is no future . The Syrians have almost destroyed it for us . You ca n't blame the Christians for wanting to leave . " Inside the church , worshipers have just completed the Sunday liturgy , and are filing into the back hall for a special dinner honoring Lebanon 's national holiday . The congregation is composed of the descendants of Lebanese immigrants , and a healthy number of new arrivals from the old country  --  whose presence is a sign of decline in the homeland of the Middle East 's most vibrant Christian community . <p> " The Maronites want to get out of Lebanon , " says Bernadette Karam . " A lot of people are waiting or hope , in any way , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to do anything to escape . " <p> " It 's very dangerous there . Everybody is against us . We 're scared . This is why we left , " says Abdo Houayek , standing with his family . " I was born in 1960 , but when I grew up in the 1970s , that 's when the war started against the Christians . This is why we 're scared . It 's just best to take your kids and leave . If we have a democracy , we 'll go back . But for now , it 's too dangerous . This is not the first war against the Christians , or the last . Those who can leave , are leaving . " <p> There have been Maronites  --  Catholics who adhere to one of the Catholic Church 's Eastern rites  --  in Lebanon for 1,700 years . Maronite Christianity arrived with a 4th-century monk named Maron , who  --  along with his followers  --  left the church in Antioch ( in what is now Syria ) after a theological dispute . Looking for a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near the Mediterranean coast . <p> For the many centuries since , Maronites have been practicing their faith and defending themselves against rival Christian sects as well as against Muslims . When the Crusaders arrived , the Maronites welcomed them , and subsequently entered into full communion with Rome . By far the largest Christian denomination in Lebanon , Maronites have since the Middle Ages considered themselves an outpost of the West in a hostile Muslim land . When the end of World War I brought with it the end of four centuries of Ottoman oppression , and delivered Lebanon into the hands of the French , Maronites realized a long-held dream : an independent , Christian-dominated Lebanon . <p> France designed Lebanon 's government to favor the Maronites  --  which naturally upset the country 's Muslims , who began decades of agitation for their fair share of power . The PLO 's attempted takeover of the country in the early 1970s exacerbated Muslim-Christian tension , and sparked the catastrophic civil war that began in 1975 . Syria invaded in 1976 , and remained throughout the conflict , which ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsequent defeat of the last Maronite holdout , Gen. Michel Aoun . <p> The peace agreement called for the disarming of all militias , which , with the very important exception of Hezbollah , was accomplished . The Syrian army , too , was supposed to withdraw , but refused , citing the Israeli military presence in the southern Lebanon buffer zone . Israel withdrew entirely from Lebanon two years ago , but Syria remains , running the country as a vassal state . Damascus continues to wage a proxy war on Israel through Hezbollah , which it allows to operate in southern Lebanon . The vichy of the Middle East <p> Though reliable statistics are impossible to come by , the U.S. government estimates that Christians account for 30 percent of Lebanon 's population of 3.5 million . The wartime exodus of Christians has continued in peacetime under the present Syrian-dominated government , which diaspora Lebanese liken to a Vichy regime . Though Lebanon is not an Islamic theocracy , Christians there have been effectively reduced to dhimmitude  --  second-class status  --  because of their opposition to the Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressing the Christians : In recent weeks , they 've shut down a Maronite television station and announced plans to prosecute Christian political leaders on dubious national-security charges . <p> The real boss of Lebanon : Syria 's dictator Assad Jr. , by Ismael Roldan <p> Chillingly , the regime is even trying to extend its reach to the diaspora . In October , Beirut issued instructions to its intelligence agents , telling them to keep track of Lebanese in America  --  " collaborators with the Israeli enemy "  --  who participated in a Maronite gathering in Los Angeles this year , or who support the Syria Accountability Act now before the U.S. Congress . On November 4 , a group of Lebanese-American leaders wrote to attorney general John Ashcroft requesting an investigation into Beirut 's spying on American citizens . <p> Even in the face of Beirut 's aggressive tactics , Lebanese-American Christian activists sense that now may be the first chance in a decade  --  and maybe their last chance ever  --  to free their people from the Syrian yoke and turn Lebanon into a peaceful and prosperous pluralist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to be about eliminating Islamic terror , Hezbollah must be crushed  --  and that would mean the eviction from Lebanon of its Syrian protectors . <p> That 's why the diaspora leadership is so excited  --  and the Beirut government is so worried  --  about the Syria Accountability Act . The bill , which was introduced in both houses last April , would impose severe economic and diplomatic sanctions on Damascus until , among other things , it withdraws troops from Lebanon and ceases to support and harbor terrorists . Despite heavy bipartisan support for the legislation in both houses of Congress , however , the Bush administration opposes it , as does the State Department ; aside from the merits of the legislation , any administration will oppose in principle an attempt by Congress to manage foreign policy . But there is also a feeling , particularly at State , that Syria is owed consideration for being helpful to America 's war against al-Qaeda and Iraq . Since the September 11 attacks , the rattled regime of Bashar Assad has been trying to improve relations with the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council to back America 's coming war against Saddam . State argues that Congress should n't jeopardize much-needed help from Syria . " What help ? " snorts Johns Hopkins University Syria expert Marius Deeb . " Catching a few guys Syria does n't want ? " <p> Anti-Syrian Lebanese worry that the administration could in effect trade Lebanon to its occupier in exchange for help in the war with Iraq . There is precedent for this . " In the Gulf War , the Syrians offered to help against Saddam . America averted its gaze from the Syrian attack on Gen. Aoun , " explains leading Middle East scholar Fouad Ajami , a native-born Lebanese Muslim . " The late Hafez Assad used the cover of the Gulf War to basically complete the takeover of Lebanon by eliminating the last pocket of resistance . " <p> Mindful of this , a delegation of Lebanese-American Christian leaders paid a call on the State Department in mid November , to urge U.S. diplomats not to cut deals with Syria at Lebanon 's expense . Dr. Ziad Abdelnour , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcore Arabists " of the State Department of running interference for Damascus . " I 've been working with State for the past 20 or 30 years , and I 'm telling you , nobody gives a damn about the Syrians , but they do n't want to anger the Saudis , who protect Syria 's interests , " says Abdelnour . <p> Leaders of the Lebanese opposition criticized President Bush for meeting with Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri , who was in Washington last month to request support for international financial assistance to bail out his country 's ailing economy . " The administration is playing into the hands of Syria , " warns Abdelnour , who was a New York investment banker before taking up political activism . " Where is the money going ? The country is controlled by Syria . Capital will not go there until the situation is fixed . Otherwise , you 're throwing your money away . " <p> True , Washington has more pressing concerns than removing Syria from Lebanon , but it 's hard to see how the administration 's long-term goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo argue that Syria has a history of responding to U.S. pressure by turning to America 's enemies  --  but without the Soviet card to play against the U.S. , and with the Iraqi regime about to be destroyed , that is now largely an empty threat . <p> If Syria and its terrorist clients can be coerced to withdraw , conditions are favorable for Lebanon to become a model of democracy and prosperity for a region that has known little of either . The entrepreneurial Lebanese have a reputation as a trading people , going back to the days of the Phoenicians . Indeed , before the country committed sectarian suicide in the 1970s , it was known as the Switzerland of the Middle East . Lebanon is also the only Arab nation that has had anything like free speech and democracy . <p> " Lebanese Christians have been carrying Western values since before the United States was founded , " says Walid Phares , a political-science professor at Florida Atlantic University . " We could play a tremendous role in defending the interests of the international community . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world that we 're not siding with the Arabists and Islamists against the West and Israel . " <p> The longstanding Maronite alliance with Israel is a source of tension with Lebanese Muslims . In the 1940s , the Maronite patriarch extended a welcome to the Jewish immigrants to Palestine , correctly seeing the potential for an alliance with a Western-oriented people trying to survive amid hostile Muslims . During the civil war , Maronite militia forces had the backing of the Israelis , who crossed into Lebanon to pursue the PLO in 1982 . The infamous massacre of unarmed Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps was carried out by Maronite militiamen , and the Israelis stood accused of allowing the murders to take place . Even today , many Maronites freely admit that their side did not have clean hands during the war , and committed atrocities just as their Muslim counterparts did . This ability to confess error is another reason some knowledgeable observers believe that a Syrian withdrawal would not carry with it a large risk of renewed civil war . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ajami . " They themselves set their country on fire , with a lot of help from the neighborhood . They 've endured 25 years of hell , and they 've learned that the country has to be shared . " Hope for Lebanon 's future <p> Ajami points out that , thanks largely to the Christian population , Lebanon 's people are much better educated than others in the region , and thus would be " a damn good place to start " experimenting with the kind of democracy Washington would like to see take hold in the Middle East . A free and secular Lebanon would also benefit from the knowledge and expertise its expatriates acquired in the U.S. Abdelnour , 41 , fled the war , earned a business degree at the Wharton School , and prospered in America ; he says he and his Lebanese Muslim friends who have had a similar experience have learned from their adopted land the virtues of secular democracy , free markets , and the rule of law . <p> " These guys Muslims are the best of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard Business School , they 're great guys . They 're not sectarian . They want to build the country too . " <p> As it turns to debate on the Syria Accountability Act , Congress will want to ask : Why is it in America 's interest to ignore these pro-Western Middle Easterners , and instead do the bidding of Syria 's water-carriers in Saudi-funded think tanks and at Foggy Bottom ? On the answer to that question hinges the fate of Lebanese Christians , and of Lebanon itself . If Syria is permitted to continue its stranglehold on Lebanon , by the time Washington gets around to paying attention  --  and attention must be paid , at some point  --  there may not be enough of these natural allies left with whom to build a democracy . <p> " The island that the Christians are living on within Lebanon is getting smaller and smaller , " says Tony Feisal , who edits an Arabic community newspaper in New York . " If they can find a way to emigrate , they are doing it . At some stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything else is compromisable . The longer the situation persists , the longer the desperation grows . Once the Christians leave , they will probably only go back on a tourist visa . " <p> By Rod Dreher <p>
