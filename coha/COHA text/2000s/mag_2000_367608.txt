You are not , to paraphrase Jay McInerney , the sort of person who would watch Survivor . It 's not just the larvae-eating contest ( which ex-Survivor B.B. Andersen , 64 , helpfully describes as " like having a booger in your mouth " ) . It 's the gladiatorial concept : stranding 16 people on a tropical island to scrabble for food and shelter , all for the delectation of sluggards licking Cheetos dust off their fingers in their air-conditioned living rooms . It 's the Machiavellian twist : having the contestants vote one another off the island until there is a single million-dollar winner and 15 rejects . It 's the suffering , the mean-spiritedness , the humiliation . <P> And that 's why you are watching Survivor . And you , and you .

The first week the Pulau Tiga-based game show aired , ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . Survivor won in almost every audience category . The second week , Survivor won hands down . By the third week  --  when Regis Philbin , monochrome outfit in tatters , slunk away to lick his wounds , leaving Two Guys and a Girl and Norm to take his butt whuppin ' for him  --  Survivor had ballooned into the biggest TV success since the last voyeur-vision landmark : Fox 's gift to late-night comedians , Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire ? Which  --  we know , we know  --  you did n't watch . <P> Something strange is happening in television : the rise of VTV , voyeur television . Despite Survivor 's gross-outs , its dark premise and its wall-to-wall cheesiness  --  the faux-Lion King sound track , the " tribal councils " held in what looks like a Holiday Inn Polynesian lounge circa 1963 , the somber narration of Jeff Probst , former host of VH1 's Rock ' n ' Roll Jeopardy ! and challenger to Regis for luckiest-man-in-America status  --  despite all this , viewers have embraced the desert-island soap with fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly ?
