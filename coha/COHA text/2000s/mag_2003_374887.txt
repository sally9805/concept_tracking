In this war , the mighty but merciful allies target bombs carefully and tend to the enemy 's wounded . In that war , the allies blow up women and babies . In this war , Iraq is postponing certain defeat by cheating , killing civilians and using human shields . In that war , a weak nation is steadfastly defending itself using the only effective means available . This war , on American television , is alternately " the war in Iraq " or " Operation Iraqi Freedom . " That war , broadcast by the media of the Arab and Muslim worlds , is " the invasion . " <P> It is hardly unusual for two camps to see the same war differently . But in 1991 , Western , Arab and Muslim audiences used their rooting interests to filter the same source : American TV . This time , Arab audiences and Muslims outside the Middle East have homegrown TV networks to reflect their perspectives and , sometimes , bias  --  Qatar 's widely known al-Jazeera , available on some U.S. satellite and cable systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( You probably watch them too  --  American TV uses rebroadcast deals to pick up selected footage . ) Arabs and Muslims distrustful of Western media  --  like Turkish students and professors who burned a TV last week to protest CNN 's " one-sided " coverage  --  are happy to have their own alternatives . " We saw Gulf War I through the eyes of Peter Arnett , " says Nabil El-Sharif , editor in chief of Jordan 's Ad-Dustour newspaper , referring to a war correspondent for CNN in 1991 . " Now we 're seeing the war through Arab eyes . " <P> Arab eyes were a crucial consideration in planning Gulf War II . Its targets and tactics were chosen to avoid stirring up anti-American sentiment . But that strategy has not led to friendly coverage on Arab and Muslim TV or a warm reception from its audiences . Like U.S. TV , the Arab networks show briefings , sound bites from George W. Bush and Tony Blair , allied advances and even interviews with coalition troops ( al-Jazeera has a reporter embedded with U.S. forces ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Cameras linger over dead allied soldiers and bandaged Iraqi children . Mourning families wail , and hospitals choke with bleeding and burned civilians . If the war on American TV has been a splendid fireworks display and tank parade punctuated by press conferences , on al-Jazeera et al. , war is hell . <P> For its grisly pictures and aggressive coverage of the coalition , al-Jazeera in particular has been treated as a fifth column in the West . U.S. and British officials condemned it for airing footage of allied POWs ' corpses , and the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have ejected al-Jazeera reporters . Hackers attacked its English-language website , replacing it with a red-white-and-blue U.S. map and the slogan LET FREEDOM RING . What better motto for people who shut down a news outlet ?
