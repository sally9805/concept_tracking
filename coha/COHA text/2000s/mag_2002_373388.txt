The day after the first anniversary of my sister Maureen Reagan 's death , Charlton Heston announced that he had been diagnosed with " symptoms consistent with early stages of Alzheimer 's . " Sometimes in life , there are odd juxtapositions of events  --  an interplay of circumstances that makes one pause and wonder what forces are at work . This was one of those times for me . Maureen was so committed to defeating the scourge of Alzheimer 's , to getting more funding for research and increasing understanding of the disease that she sometimes delayed her own treatment for the melanoma that eventually killed her . <P> Maureen would have tirelessly done interviews on Aug. 9 ; instead , her husband Dennis Revell spoke to the media , as did the actor David Hyde Pierce , who lost both his grandfather and his father to Alzheimer 's . My mother released a statement . Maureen 's voice had been silenced , but her activism , her determination , were still present . <P> We learn about diseases through the faces of those who are stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we think of Alzheimer 's , my father 's face comes to mind . Or Iris Murdoch 's . And now Heston 's . When Parkinson 's is mentioned , we picture Michael J. Fox or Muhammad Ali . <P> But there is another way that faces tell the story . You have to lean closer , look carefully into the eyes , study the set of the jaw and the tilt of the head . I recognized more than the famous visage of Heston when I saw his taped announcement . I saw the first shallow waves of a cruel disease lapping at the edges of the person he has always known himself to be . I recognized it because I saw the same look in my father 's eyes eight years ago . <P> In the early stages of Alzheimer 's , the eyes have a wariness , a veil of fear . It 's as if the person is standing at the edge of a fogbank , knowing that in time it will engulf him and there is no chance of outrunning it . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would happen when a sentence broke off because he could n't remember how to finish it . Or when he would say , " I have this condition  --  I keep forgetting things . " He was on a high wire , balancing on courage , with the dark waters of fear below , and he was using every bit of his strength to cling to that wire . <P> Slowly  --  sometimes over months , sometimes over years  --  the eyes stop pleading . There is a resignation , an acceptance of distance , strangeness , a life far from home . You know the look when you see it , and the only mercy is that fear seems to have subsided .
