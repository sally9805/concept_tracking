Earth received a cosmic calling card last week . It arrived in the form of a huge rock , about 1,000 ft. in diameter , that hurtled past the planet at 68,000 m.p.h . The asteroid , newly dubbed 2001 YB5 , missed us by some 500,000 miles , about twice our distance from the moon . For astronomers , however , that was a hairbreadth , and a dramatic reminder that space is filled with debris that has devastated our planet in the past and could very likely to do so again . <P> Had 2001 YB5 been on target , says Donald Yeomans , a senior scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , it would have struck with the explosive force of some 4,000 megatons , enough to obliterate a major metropolitan center and the surrounding countryside . But what troubles most scientists is that the asteroid was detected only two weeks before it flew by . If it had been headed toward impact , those in the target area would have had barely enough time to write their wills . Eleanor Helin , whose Near-Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on average , one object the size of 2001 YB5 or larger passes close by annually ; many such asteroids are undetected . Her goal , and that of the other asteroid hunters , is to identify the intruders , plot their orbits and predict possible impacts further in advance . That might just provide enough time for measures to deflect or destroy the menace before catastrophe strikes . <P>  --  By Leon Jaroff
