MIDNIGHT IN THE GOLEM factory . Sweat and clay and blisters . Twitching pains in the wrist and the small of the back . The door to Moises ' sanctum opens and closes . The motion of Moises ' passing bangs the row of hanging platforms together , as if the unlivened molds are thrashing in whatever nightmares afflict clay that knows it must be born . <p> Twenty-eight men work in what is now called Building G , a steel-andconcrete cube near the center of the Ford River Rouge complex , which will be the largest factory in the world for another month or so until Willow Run is complete . Inside Building G , the three-story space is ringed by a catwalk twelve feet above the floor . Two doors off the catwalk lead to overpasses that in turn connect to other buildings . One of the doors , on the north wall , is usually under tight surveillance by Building G 's crew because that 's where Swerdlow comes from , and it 's a poor bunch of line rats that does n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , three large bay doors face the train siding outside , and beyond it the canal slip that leads down to the turning basin and the Rouge River . Spanning the ceiling , a spine of girders supports a crane-mounted scoop bucket . clay comes in on open train cars . The scoop bucket drops giant clots of streaming , weedy goo on a screen just inside the bay doors ; the screener comes to life , shaking the bucketloads into pieces small enough to fall through the screen onto a conveyor belt . A work detail of a dozen men goes at this steady flow of head-sized gobs of clay with pick and shovel , breaking it down and pitching it onto the sorting line still squirming with swamp life . The breakdown and sorting crews are under strict orders to kill as few of these worms and snails and crawdads as they can manage , on Moises ' eccentric theory that the incorporation of these little lives will make the golems that much stronger and more unpredictable in battle . Nobody knows if this strategy will pay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe without seeing any real difference among them - but every man on the line has thought at least once that at the end of eight hours shoveling clay it 's hard to worry about the lives of snails . <p> It would be a hell of a lot more efficient to use the same clay pits that provided most of the Rouge 's bricks ; after all , some of them are still on the property . But whether buying an iron mine or defending the Republic , Henry Ford is a tight man with a dollar . Even before they knew that golems made from American clay would n't leave North America , Ford had decided that good brickmaking clay was too useful to divert to a crazy Yid project like making golems , and anyway he had God 's own bounty of the stuff coming out of the swampy parts of the soybean fields and woods he 's paving for the Willow Run plant , which is starting to churn out B-24s even though parts of the plant itself are still just I-beams and acres of poured concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the docks at the Brooklyn Navy Yard refusing to get on the ship , someone somewhere wangled a way to get fresh riverbottom clay from Europe . All of this raw stuff comes with impurities in the form of roots , rocks , and about nine million bullet casings and bits of shrapnel per cubic yard - not to mention frogs , snakes , and occasionally fish , once in a while an unlucky muskrat . If this were a regular industrial operation , all of this stuff would be screened and pressed out of the clay , but Moises is n't rational on the topic , so anything that once had a pulse is supposed to be left on the sorting belt . At the same time the old rabbi is mortally convinced that only detailed human attention will get rid of all bits of metal . " You do n't want to see what happens if I raise a golem that has a bent nail still in it , " he says . The men on the line do n't know what to make of Moises . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caricature out of Ford 's Dearborn Independent or one of Father Coughlin 's nightmares , but the men on the Frankenline all remember their first night on the job - the way color slowly bloomed in the skin of that first golem , the way that when it sat up on its metal slab , the sole traces of its origin were the mud-gray color of its eyes and the tiny letters etched into the skin of its forehead . If Moises says that something bad would happen if they left a nail in the clay , they 've all seen enough to believe it . <p> The sorting crew , a dozen men , works with trowels and rakes to break the clay down into clots that would fit nicely in your hand . At the end of the conveyor , these clots pass under a magnet with some kind of gadget attached that lights up if they 've missed a piece of steel . If the gadget lights up , the belt stops until the sorting crew finds what set it off . Under that part of the belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken watches , all kinds of stuff . When the shift changes , the outgoing crew is supposed to roll the bin to the scrapyard behind the blast furnaces . <p> Every so often , more often than they would have figured given what the clay has been through to get to this point , a live frog springs out of the piles . If Swerdlow is n't in the neighborhood they stop the line and chase around after it . Whoever catches the frog decides what to do with it ; the line is about evenly divided among three opinions . Some hold that the frog should be immobilized in the clay for molding into a golem ; others that any frog with the gumption to live through excavation , transport , shoveling , picking , and sorting deserves a get-out-of-jail-free card by way of the canal ; still others that the primary function of live frogs is to become frog legs . <p> Snakes are by common consent preserved to be put into Swerdlow 's desk . This is a tradition that predates the Frankenline , predates even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 or so when Swerdlow was one of Harry Bennett 's Special Service goons , he had once made a Pole by the name of Czerkawski eat a dead snake right at his station , and then fired him for holding up the line . Then , the old-timers like to say , putting a snake in Swerdlow 's desk was like being blooded in combat . There were consequences . Now all he does is charge out of his office and scream at whoever 's walking by , but even this small reward is enough to keep the practice alive . What the hell , most of the guys on the Frankenline are spoiling for the war but held out of it by the scarlet 4F ; they need someone to piss on once in a while . <p> Jared Cleaves is one of those guys . He 'd be in the South Pacific somewhere , probably mopping up Guadalcanal , except he got in a car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway near the end of basic . The car rolled , and somewhere along the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windshield . Now the ring and pinkie fingers of his right hand do n't move quite like they should ; the Army says he 's twenty percent disabled . He 's still able to make little pieces of clay out of big pieces of clay , though . Most of the time he can convince himself that it 's enough to contribute to the war effort , that he does n't have to prove himself under fire . <p> This is harder today , though , because his wife Colleen is pregnant . They thought they were being careful ; they had every intention of waiting until the end of the war ; but there you go . The baby 's due in November . <p> Jumping Jesus , a baby . A boy ? A girl ? He 's got to make something of himself . Ca n't have a kid growing up seeing his old man come home every night covered in riverbottom . <p> The guys on either side of Jared are about as different as two men can be . Jem , on his left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky . Twenty years old , with a chip on his shoulder over his father being killed in a mine strike and memories of boiling shoe leather and grass for soup still fresh in his head . Jem is spoiling for a chance to get a snake into Swerdlow 's desk . He swears he 'll write his name on it first . Opposite Jem is Felton , who in Jared 's estimate is about forty years old , been to one of the Negro colleges in the South and then come home to Detroit . Once Jared asked Felton why he was breaking up clay with a college degree , and Felton said it was better than working in the foundry . Which was n't really any kind of answer at all . <p> The three of them form a kind of pod on the Frankenline since they 're the only native speakers of English in Building G unless Swerdlow drops by to call them all malingering goldbricks who are killing fine American boys overseas through sheer laziness , and by God he ought to report them all as fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to report one of the boys on the Frankenline , it would be the razorcut gent in the black suit who stops by every day to look down from the catwalk and then step into Moises ' office for a quick word . " If that ai n't a spy , " Felton says , " you can call me Tojo . " <p> Typically Jem and Jared call him Tojo for an hour or so after every one of these appearances , just on general principles . Today , however , the spy comes and goes unnoticed by Jared because the only thought in his head is Jumping Jesus , a baby . <p> " Fellas , " he says , " I have news . " <p> " We took Paris , " Jem says . <p> " Harry Bennett got religion , " Felton says . <p> " Better , " Jared says . " Colleen 's in a family way . " <p> Felton shakes his head . " Good Lord . Another Cleaves . " He sticks out his hand and Jared shakes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the molders look up in puzzlement and ask each other questions in five or six languages . <p> Jem turns around and spreads his arms . " Jared Cleaves is having a baby , y'all ! " he announces . " A baby ! " He makes a cradle of his arms and swings it back and forth , and a cheer rises from the molders and the other guys on the sorting line . Jared realizes he has a goofy smile on his face , and the realization makes him blush . He turns back to the belt and picks up his trowels . <p> SORTED CLAY TUMBLES down an incline to a conveyor that dumps it into a bin . From this bin , it 's shoveled out onto long gurneys with shallow outlines of human forms stamped into them . The molding crew is all Jewish and all European ; Moises wo n't have it any other way . Each golem is molded by a single man , - if his shift ends while he 's working on it , it 's supposed to remain unfinished until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going right - when a wildcat rail strike does n't hang up the clay and the screener does n't jam and the magnetic doodad is n't on the fritz and the molders are n't drunk - Moises typically enlivens one golem for every two the crew puts together . He works sixteen-hour days to keep up . Whoever is running the Frankenline ( and nobody is quite sure whether it 's the OSS or G-2 or maybe the FBI ; it sure as hell is n't Ford ; Edsel might go for it , but he 's a sick man and even when healthy not strong enough to stand up to the Old Man 's loopy anti-Jewish mania ) must be looking for another rabbi who knows the trick , but apparently Moises is onto a secret that nobody else knows and he is n't willing to share . Strange bird , Moises . If anyone on the Frankenline knows where he 's from , it 's the molders , and they are n't telling . Jared has heard that he lives over on Twelfth Street in the old Jewish neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the Rouge complex , and a third rumor has it that whoever runs the Frankenline keeps him under guard in a safe house for fear that Nazi agents will assassinate him . Where Moises is concerned , anything could be true . <p> As each new golem comes stalking blank-faced out of Moises ' sanctum , a Hungarian by the name of Ferenc pushes the next gurney over to a series of hooks hanging from a track on the ceiling . Ferenc hooks four of them through the rings welded onto each corner of the gurney . With each group of four hooks dangles a switch ; he throws it , and the gumey rises up about six feet off the ground . When Ferenc rings a bell on the wall of Moises ' office , a portion of the office wall slides open . With a rattle the gurney moves through the opening , and the wall closes behind it . This happens roughly once an hour , and Jared registers in the back of his mind that it 's happening now : the rattle of chains and hum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . Another golem , another hour . This time it 's four down , four to go ; almost time for lunch . <p> Someone taps him on the arm and Jared turns to see that it 's Moises himself . He has , for no good reason , a moment of pure panic , as if he 's just been given the Finger of Death . Then , when his heart starts beating again , he says , " Hey , Moises , " thinking , what 'd I do ? <p> " You have a baby , " Moises said . " Is a happy thing . Mazel tov . " <p> Jared 's nodding . " Thanks , yeah . Mazel tov to you too . " <p> Moises cracks a smile and shuffles back to his office . He pauses at the doorway and steps aside to let a golem out . The golem walks out the door to wait by the rail siding ; Moises shuts the door behind him , and a few seconds later another gurney slides in to join him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Mostly this comes from the Aleutians , where the Army is slowly grinding down the Japanese garrison . Those golems are among the first to step off the Frankenline ; it was a cold bucket of water when project planners realized that those golems , made of American clay , would n't leave the continent where they were - if you want to put it that way - born . This setback almost put the kibosh on the whole project , but it 's all worked out now . The new golems go and get on the trains to New York and then troop right up onto freighters for the ride across the U-boat-infested North Atlantic . About a dozen ships carrying golems have gone down , precipitating a lively discussion among Jem , Jared , and Fclton regarding their survival . Jared is of the opinion that they probably just turn to mush in the ocean , and Felton usually agrees with him . Jem holds out stubbornly for his vision of golems climbing from the wreckage at the bottom of the sea and setting out to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to scrub one of the letters off ' em , do n't he ? " Jem always says . " That 's the only way to kill ' em unless you shoot ' em all to pieces . " <p> This is a good point , but Jared still thinks that ten thousand feet of salt water is every bit as rough on a golem as an artillery shell . They 're all hoping that Jem is right , though , because it would be a pure rush to see pictures of one of their golems walking right up out of the ocean onto the beach in France . As it is , they hear that the golems are used just to scare the bejeezus out of the Nazis , and once in a while as diversions for covert missions or commando operations . There 's no way to know how much of this is true . <p> Jared gets a rusted fishhook through his left thumb , and stomps around for a while cussing . " Ca n't talk like that when your baby 's born , " Jem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Shut up . I do n't need no Bible-thumping hillbilly telling me how to talk . " <p> " You got your shots ? " Felton asks . <p> Jared is hunched over his injured hand , slowly working the fishhook the rest of the way through . " Goddammit . Yeah . I had my shots when I went in the Army . " <p> " Hate to see you get lockjaw with a baby on the way . " <p> " Well , at least he would n't cuss around the baby , " Jem says , and breaks up at his joke . <p> " Jem , I 'm about to stick this fishhook in your eye , you do n't shut up , " Jared growls . <p> Swerdlow chooses this moment to appear . " Come on , ladies , Cleaves , you got something better to do than make golems ? " He notices fared pressing his thumb against the one dry spot on his coveralls . " Fingers hurt , Cleaves ? Poor baby . " <p> " Jared stuck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh no , " Swerdlow says . " A fishhook , give him a Purple Heart and send him home . Boy gets a fishhook in the thumb , he 's done his duty . Gawd . What a bunch of goldbricks . " He throws up his hands in disgust and leaves . <p> Jared is wishing he had some kind of death-ray vision . He wills it to happen , focusing on a mole just above Jem 's left eyebrow . " Why ca n't you keep your mouth shut ? " he says . <p> Jem gets sullen . " I was explaining . " <p> " All right , " Felton says . " How about we make some golems ? " <p> Rattle rattle rattle creak . Last golem of the night tracks into Moises ' sanctum . Everyone on the Frankenline has the same kind of clock sense as fared ; they all stretch , take their tools over to the long sinks that line the wall near the ground-floor doorway opposite the scoop bucket . Restaurant-style spray nozzles hang like dying steel-and-rubber sunflowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all the way and blast this foreign clay down the drains that empty into the canal slip . A billion little silty bits of Europe , Jared thinks , finding their way to the Detroit River , and maybe after that Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence and who knows , maybe someday all the way home , returning transformed like the golems themselves . At the end of eight hours breaking up gobs of clay , these are the kind of thoughts that run through Jared 's head , - the blast of the water and the steam rising in his face wrap him up in a sensory cocoon , and he falls into an easy reverie . A baby . There 's a thousand babies born every day , maybe every hour . It 's the most natural thing in the world but he has a bone-deep conviction that it is happening to him in a way that it 's never happened to anyone else . If he was on Guadalcanal , he would n't be having a baby . Maybe two fingers was n't such a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like when it 's real , when it cries and waves its stubby hands and grabs onto his finger like he knows it will . Please let it change me , he thinks . I 'll still just be a guy who spends his days breaking up clay , but I 'll have a baby . He wo n't care about my fingers . He wo n't care that I 'm not in the Army . <p> " Hey , Felton , " Jem says . Jared looks up and blinks the steam out of his eyes . Jem is standing by the magnetic doodad . They check it at the end of every shift . " Did you turn this off ? " Jem asks , and that 's when all hell breaks loose . <p> There 's a shout from Moises , and a roar that rattles every window in Building G. Bang - a huge dent appears in the tin wall of Moises ' office next to the door . Bang - the dent bulges outward . And bang - the whole sheet of tin leaps away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . <p> It looks like all the rest of the golems , but after the first glance something about the golem raises the hairs on the back of Jared 's neck . Maybe it 's the skin the color of old plaster , maybe the eyes like a drowned man 's , maybe the just-askew motions of the body as it walks and turns its head to take in its surroundings . All golems look a little off , not quite human , with some quality that would make you notice them in a crowd even though afterward you 'd say that there was nothing remarkable about them . This one , though , there 's a charge coming off it , like the psychic equivalent of whacking your funnybone . It twitches , its head rolls back and forth as if it does n't know how to move its eyes , and when it bangs into one of the empty gurneys , it rears back and slaps the gurney all the way across the floor to bang into the sorting line . Then a strange calm falls over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cluster of men around the sinks . Its head lowers and it walks toward them . <p> There are moments when you do n't have to understand a language to know what someone is saying . This is one of them , as a half-dozen versions of Let 's get the hell out of here tangle in the weirdly charged air . People scatter , and the golem must be getting used to its body because it moves with sudden decision and focus , barely missing Ferenc before the Hungarian makes it out the door and down the railroad tracks , trailing a string of gibberish that Jared does n't think is words even in Hungarian . This diversion gets nearly everyone else enough room to clear the building ; even Jem and Felton hightail it out through the bay doors facing the canal slip . <p> Jared ca n't take his eyes off the golem . It veers away from the door Ferenc went through , and bangs into a nearly finished mold . An expression of odd confusion passes over its face , and it scoops a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long moment it works the clay in its palm ; bits fall to the floor . Then the golem stuffs the handful of clay in its mouth . Jared has a dislocated memory of his mother , maybe ? grouching at his little brother Chucky . God , kids like you , you 'll put anything in your mouths . The golem is distracted . It chews the clay , looking thoughtful . <p> Over its shoulder Jared sees Moises emerging from the shambles of his sanctum . He does n't look injured , but his posture and expression are those of a man so afraid of what he must do that he has absented himself from his own mind so that he may do it . While the golem munches the almostflesh of its - brother ? cousin ? - Moises walks toward it like a man sleepwalking , and , as if soothing it , rubs a hand down the left side of its forehead . Until then , Jared has n't noticed the letters inscribed on the golem 's skin ; now he 's taken with the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth becomes dead , and with its mouth open , weedy clay dribbling down its chin , the golem collapses into a heap of riverbottom . <p> You 'll put anything in your mouths . Jared 's mother 's voice wo n't leave his head . <p> Moises takes a long , shuddering breath . Then he crouches next to the remains of the golem , taking an old man 's care getting his balance on his haunches . His hands slide over the heap of dead clay , and pause . He digs one hand into the clay and comes up with a chunk of rusty metal . He holds it out in one upturned palm and with the other hand points an accusatory finger at Jared . " You . Thinking of baby , " he says . " You do n't pay attention . " <p> A rifle shell ? A nail from the sole of a boot ? A belt buckle ? Holy moly , Jared thinks . Moises was right . But when he opens his mouth , what comes out is , " The magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal at him . It misses , pinging off the wall over the sinks . He stands there for another moment , then returns to his office . A moment passes . Then the chains rattle and the crane motor groans , and another gurney passes inside . If Jared took three steps to his right , he 'd be able to see what was happening . Right then , though , that 's the last thing in the world he wants to see . <p> " Hey , uh , Moises ? " he calls . " If the magnet 's busted , you sure you should do that ? " <p> No answer . <p> He understands , not with any great flash of insight but with quiet satisfaction , as if he 's just made a perfect tracing of his own face in a mirror . Moises is making offspring , and through them making his dream of a world risen from the broken rubble of the Europe that cast him out . One little piece of metal , one clay-buster who ca n't pay attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and molders are coming back in . Jem and Felton peer in through the bay door . " Where 'd it go ? " Jem asks . <p> Everyone 's looking at Jared , and he feels like he should say something , but he 's filled up . Again he opens his mouth with no idea what will fall out . <p> " I 'll be damned , " Jared says . But what he 's thinking is that fatherhood is going to be a hell of a thing . <p> IMG
