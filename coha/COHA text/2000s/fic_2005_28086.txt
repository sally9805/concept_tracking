Chapter One " A is for Amy who fell down the stairs , " says my best friend , Jenna Davis , as we climb farther down into the steep , parched ravine . We 've been inseparable since we were five and her mother brought her to my house to play . We bonded over the various ways we could contort my Barbie and Ken dolls without breaking them . Let 's just say that Ken wo n't be having children anytime soon and leave it at that . " B is for Basil , assaulted by bears , " I reply , continuing the morbid rhyme we memorized off the poster on my bedroom wall . Each letter of the alphabet has a rhyme about a little kid meeting some bizarre end . I like the poster because it is in black and white to everyone else , but inside my head , it 's in color . " Could it be any hotter out ? " Jenna asks , panting with the effort to keep her footing on the slippery slope . The sweat dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rolled around too soon , and we only have a few more weeks before eighth grade starts . If we lived a little farther south , a tumbleweed would tumble by . As we stumble down the familiar path of tall , sun-bleached grass and dry earth , I can feel the air thickening , preparing for a storm . At thirteen , Jenna and I are much too old for day camp . We already live out in the country , with all the fresh air we could want . We entertain ourselves by pretending there is still some square inch of countryside that we have n't discovered yet . Every day we explore the hills , the valley in between , the ravine , the woods . Last summer we found an arrowhead half buried under a bush . My father said it might have been from the Blackhawk War , the one that Abe Lincoln fought in when he was young . This year all we 've found is the same old crabgrass , same old bugs , same old us . But still , exploring passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're spared the smell of manure from the Roth 's farm across the valley . That 's something to be thankful for . When we were younger , we used to pretend that the ravine , always dry like this during the summer months , would lead us someplace else-somewhere magical , with adventures and swords and talking animals like in the Narnia books . Sometimes I still catch Jenna peeking behind bushes for hidden doorways . She 's trying to find a way to reach her mother , who died three years ago from some kind of cancer that only women get . Mrs. Davis was so sweet and pretty , with red hair and freckles just like Jenna . Except Jenna is short like me , and Mrs. Davis was really tall . Before she died , Jenna 's mom bought us the rope friendship bracelets that we have never taken off . She said that as long as we kept them on , nothing could come between us . I explain this to my own mother every time she begs me to cut off the bracelet , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who cares if it 's gray and fraying and maybe even a little smelly ? The wind starts up slightly , and a big green leaf sticks to the sweat on my leg . I hold still and count to twelve before it flutters and falls to the ground . The color of the leaf is exactly the same color as Jenna 's name-a bright , shimmering shade of green with some yellow highlights . I think part of why I liked Jenna right away is that I like the color of her name . But I 'd never tell her that , nor would I tell my older sister , Beth , that her name is the murky brown of swamp water . Beth is sixteen and in the process of wearing down our parents ' patience . She changes her hair color the way normal people change their underwear . We used to be a lot closer , before she went to high school and dropped me like a piping-hot bag of microwave popcorn . Before she left for the summer , she told me the boys would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told her I 'd stick with my boring brown , thank you very much . The only natural blond in the family is Zack . He just turned eleven , and his name is the light blue of a robin 's egg . Zack has a lot of strange ideas . He can tell you exactly how many McDonald 's hamburgers he 's eaten in his lifetime . He has a detailed chart on his wall . The local paper ran a story about it once . Jenna stops walking and points at my feet . " Your sneakers are untied , " she says . " For a change . " I kick my sneakers off , tie the laces together , and drape them over my shoulder . I prefer to be barefoot anyway . Every night , the water in the bottom of my shower turns brown for a minute as the dirt runs from between my toes . Beth refuses to shower after me . Jenna starts to say something , but her words get drowned out by a helicopter flying overhead . The roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I look up to see the familiar markings of my father 's chopper . He sells and repairs small farm equipment and uses the helicopter to get to out-of-the-way places . Jenna and I wave , long hair whipping around our faces , but I do n't think he sees us . When Zack was little , he was scared Dad would n't be able to find his way home . Zack cried and cried every time the helicopter took off . Finally Dad took me and Beth and Zack up in the chopper with him to show us how easy it is to spot the landing site . Beth threw up the entire time and has n't gone for a ride since . " Are you ever scared to fly with him ? " Jenna asks when we can hear each other again . " That thing looks like it 's ready to fall apart . " " It 's fun , " I tell her , tucking my hair back in its ponytail . " It feels like you ' re a bird up there . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , you know . " A look of horror flits across Jenna 's face . " No thanks . " In all these years , Jenna has never accepted my offer . " So have you gone up to the cemetery yet ? " she asks as we continue walking along the bottom of the ravine . " No , not yet . I still have to finish the painting . " It was Jenna 's idea that I bring my grandfather a present on the one-year anniversary of his death . She brings her mother something each year , and her mother gives her gifts from the grave . Well , sort of . When Mrs. Davis knew she was n't going to live much longer , she stocked up on presents and wrote long letters about her life . She gave them to my mother to keep , and each year on Jenna 's birthday , my mother sends her one of the packages in the mail . One of these years , the gifts are going to run out and that will be a very sad birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenna asks , even though she knows better . " You know it 's bad luck to show it before it 's done . " " Why are you so superstitious ? " she asks , wiping her sweaty brow and leaving a streak of dirt . " I thought your brother 's superstitions drove you crazy . " " They do , " I insist . " I 'm not half as bad as him . If a black cat crosses his path , he locks himself in his room for the rest of the day . And forget walking under ladders . If he sees our father do it , he makes him walk around the house backward . Twice . Zack says that if Dad really wanted to make sure he undid the bad luck , he would cross his fingers until he saw a dog . " " But you do n't have a dog . " " I know . " " And what 's with the ladder thing anyway ? " I shrug . " I have no idea . But you definitely do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of weirdness in your family , " Jenna says , picking at a scab on her elbow . She does n't even know about my own personal brand of weirdness . Like everybody else , she seems to have forgotten about my third-grade incident . Which is just fine with me . " You know , " Jenna says , stepping carefully over a gnarled branch , " my father told me it could take a soul a whole year to reach heaven . Maybe that 's why it took you a year to finish the painting of your grandfather . " I have my own theory on my grandfather 's soul , but I have n't told anyone . After all , I am good at keeping secrets . " That could be it , " I respond . " C'm on , let 's get back so it does n't take me any longer . I want to bring the painting to the cemetery before dinner . " " Do we have time for a quick PIC mission ? " Jenna asks as we climb back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best part of the day , our PIC mission . Partners in Crime . The term was another gift from Jenna 's mom . She made it up after she caught me standing guard while Jenna stole quarters from the cow-shaped cookie jar in their kitchen . After that we learned to be more careful . In fifth grade , we hid in Beth 's closet when she had a slumber party . We heard lots of juicy gossip , as well as some stuff about how babies are made that cleared up a few lingering questions . To this day , Jenna and I count that as our most successful mission . " I really ca n't today , " I tell her . " Oh , it 's okay . I ca n't think of anything good anyway . This town is just too boring . " She kicks up a pile of dirt with the toe of her sneaker and sighs loudly . It takes longer than it should to get home because we have to walk all the way around the Davises ' fields . Jenna 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweetest corn for miles around . My father plowed under our fields to make the landing space for his helicopter . Jenna 's father thinks my father is lazy since he only flies three times a week and is back by dinnertime . My father thinks Jenna 's father should mind his own business . " Is your dad ever going to stop working on your house ? " Jenna asks as we come into view of it . Everyone in town , including the rest of my family , wants to know the answer to that question . The helicopter is now parked out back , and my father is already halfway up the ladder on his way to the roof . " I do n't think so , " I reply honestly . My sprawling house is famous in these parts and never fails to get a reaction . First , people stare . They look up ; they look down . Sometimes they even do that twice . The house is almost like a living creature that keeps expanding and contracting and remaking itself . Every inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all different kinds of wood-whatever they could borrow , barter , or beg for . They could never agree on how the house should be laid out , so they each did their own thing and eventually met up in the middle . This technique resulted in a number of doors that lead nowhere and stairs that go inside walls like secret passageways . That is how Jenna and I managed to wind up in the back of Beth 's closet , so I guess the spider web filled tunnels are good for something . My father is usually on a ladder hammering away at the roof when he 's not tinkering with the chopper . I call him Casper because we hardly ever see him at ground level . He calls me Wild Child because I 'm always running around barefoot feeling the earth under my feet and predicting rain . " Hi , Mr. Winchell , " Jenna shouts . My father waves at us with his hammer , his mouth full of nails . " Bye , Mr. Winchell , " Jenna shouts again as she heads toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to wave again , slips slightly , then quickly regains his balance . " How long will you be up there ? " I call out . " Till your mother makes me come down . " " Great , " I mutter . That means at least a few more hours of hammering until Mom brings Beth back from the airport . Beth ' s been gone for six whole weeks at a summer college-prep program in California . She won a full scholarship by writing an essay on the pressure of writing an essay . It was Zack ' s idea . Her return is all too soon if you ask me . It was nice not having anyone boss me around . The hammering begins and the familiar mottled gray bursts of color appear about a foot away from my face . The color and shape of a hammer hitting a nail has become such a part of my existence that I barely notice it . I can see right through the color-bursts , but they still distract me from whatever I ' m doing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much . I slip into my sneakers as I approach the back kitchen door , stepping cautiously around wooden planks , hammers , nails , and one very scary-looking chain saw . As always , the smell of sawdust is in the air and on my clothes and in my throat . It is inescapable around here , and it has long since mingled with the taste of multicolored chalk dust that still haunts me from third grade . I go up to my room and look for Mango , whose official name is Mango the Magnificant . He usually sleeps at the foot of my bed on my old Winnie-the-Pooh baby blanket , completely covering the faded Pooh and Piglet walking into the sunset . He 's not there now , but he left behind his favorite toy-a stuffed Tweety Bird that he likes to carry around in his mouth . I call out his name and hear a faraway , orange-soda-colored meow in response . I trace the sound to Beth 's room and find the little gray-and-white traitor curled up on Beth 's pillow . I swoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night table . By some huge oversight on her part , Beth left her diary right out in plain sight when she went to California . When I first noticed it , I thought maybe she wanted me to read it . Then I decided that she had probably booby-trapped it somehow and she 'd know if I peeked . I deposit Mango on my blanket , where he belongs . I start to shut the door behind me , when Zack sticks his foot in the way . " Just a sec , Mia , " Zack says , pushing the door back open . " I need to do something . " " You need to do something in my room ? " I ask , instantly suspicious . Zack has only recently gotten over his destructive phase . For years , nothing in the house was safe . He was very good at taking things apart but much less skilled at the art of putting them back together . " Do n't worry , " he insists . " It will only take a second . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway . " You have to tell me why it 's bad luck to walk under a ladder . " He rolls his eyes . " That 's easy . It 's because you 're disrupting the sacred triangle of life formed by the ladder , the ground , and the wall . " " Huh ? " I let my guard down , , and he takes this opportunity to brush past me into my room . He heads directly over to my clock collection on the far wall . I follow him and notice he 's clutching several watches in his small hands . Two belong to my father , one is my mother 's , and one is Beth 's . " What are you doing with all those wa- " " Shh , " he says , cutting me off . " I have to get this exactly right . " He stares at the faces of my clocks as if they have a message for him . " Get what exactly ri- " " Shh ! " His eyes dart from the wooden cuckoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big digital one , down to the clock in the shape of a train , and across to the electronic one that speaks the time out loud . I 've collected clocks since first grade . Every Christmas , I get to pick out another one . " I have to set these watches exactly right , " Zack explains , busily twisting the watch dials to match the time on my synchronized clocks . " Otherwise , some of us will be living in the past and some in the future . In the very same house ! Ca n't have that . Very bad . " " What difference could a minute or two make ? " " It has to do with folds in the space-time continuum , obviously , " he replies , as though I should clearly have known that . Continues ...
