The scar is visible the moment Tony Ayala Jr . takes off a T-shirt soaked from a workout in his sweltering gym . The dime-sized mark rests on his thick chest just beneath his left collarbone . <p> On his back is another scar , where the bullet fired from the trembling hands of an 18-year-old woman exited . <p> " Forty-five caliber , the biggest around , and I did n't go down , " said Ayala , a touch of fighter 's machismo in his voice . <p> The wounds of the former junior middleweight contender have healed . The women he sexually assaulted are n't as lucky . <p> One was a teen-ager beaten and raped while using the restroom at a drive-in movie theater . The other was a neighbor in Paterson , N.J. , tied up at knifepoint and raped on New Year 's Day 1983 . <p> Nancy Gomez did n't wait to find out if she were about to become another victim . The high school senior shot Ayala as he stood in the kitchen of the rented house she shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early morning hours of Dec. 12 . <p> " Baby , I 'm here to talk to you , " Ayala told Gomez just before she pulled the trigger . <p> A few hours earlier , the boxer known as " El Torito " was chasing tequila with beers in a strip club with his wife and a bodyguard . Now , at 3:45 in the morning , he was inside the darkened home of a woman he met at his gym and had over to his house for dinner a few times . <p> If it sounds familiar , it was . But 16 years in prison was supposed to have taught Ayala a lesson about entering the homes of women in the middle of the night . <p> At his first trial , Ayala testified that the sex in New Jersey was consensual , admitting years later that he had lied . Now he insists he 's telling the truth - that he was there only because he needed to talk to someone . <p> " Everybody 's assuming I was there to do something , " Ayala says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . They want their pound of flesh . " <p> Indeed they do . Prosecutors plan to try to introduce his past when he goes on trial next month on charges that could put him back in prison - this time for life . <p> First , though , the 38-year-old boxer will go back into the ring July 31 for what could be his final fight . Strapped to his ankle will be a monitor to make sure he does n't go where he should n't . <p> It 's a precaution that might have been better when Ayala was released from prison in April 1999 . <p> " Sometimes you just have a gut feeling about people , " said Marilyn Zdobinski , a New Jersey prosecutor who was in the courtroom for the first trial . " I believe he will always represent a danger to women . " <p> Tony Ayala was as fearsome a fighter as the sport had ever seen . At 19 , he was undefeated in 22 fights , a mass of uncontrolled fury in the ring and out . <p> Robbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to get knocked down and then hit again on the canvas before the referee could break things up . Ayala knocked another fighter out , then spit on him in disgust . <p> He was Mike Tyson before Mike Tyson . Ranked No. 1 at 154 pounds , he signed for a title fight with WBA champion Davey Moore that was to pay him $750,000 . His boxing future seemingly had no limit . <p> " He was wicked , vicious , " fight promoter Lester Bedford said . " When he walked into the ring you knew something dramatic was going to happen . " <p> Like Tyson , though , Ayala had demons he could n't control . Molested by a family friend for several years in grade school , he began drinking young and was using heroin by age 12 . Inside the ring was the only place he felt in control , and even there he sometimes could n't control himself . <p> " I grew up with a lot of dysfunction and I had a lot of anger as a result of my molestation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving my manhood , my strength and my dominance . I saw in an opponent someone who was challenging my manliness . " <p> Ayala was only 15 but had been fighting 10 years when he beat and sexually assaulted a girl in a restroom in San Antonio , leaving her with internal injuries and a ruptured spleen . He pleaded guilty and received 10 years ' probation . <p> A few years later , he was arrested on charges he ransacked a neighbor 's house after he was found drunk inside . <p> Ayala , who would later admit to shooting heroin before three fights , was put in rehab by his handlers and moved to New Jersey to get him away from the temptations back home in San Antonio . <p> A few weeks later , he tied up and raped a 30-year-old schoolteacher neighbor , then threatened her roommate with a knife when she came to help . <p> " Many men drink to excess and it would never occur to them to rape someone , " said Diana Scully , a sociology professor at Virginia Commonwealth University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being molested as a child is yet another excuse that is significantly overused . " <p> A jury took only three hours to reject Ayala 's claim that the sex was consensual , and a judge sentenced him to 15 to 35 years in prison . <p> A few hours later Ayala was on his way from ring riches to inmate No. 69765 at the state prison in Rahway , N.J. While there , he was counseled by prison psychologist Brian Raditz , who , in a bizarre twist , would later become Ayala 's manager and sometimes drinking partner . <p> If there were still demons , Ayala did n't show them publicly . He said all the right things and vowed never to repeat his mistakes . <p> " The pain I put the victim through will never be forgotten . It 's something I want to keep speaking out on , " Ayala said upon his release . " It was a terrible thing to do . " <p> There seemed only one thing left to prove - whether he could still fight . It did n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring on Aug. 20 , 1999 , was a time for celebration in this city 's large Hispanic community . <p> About 10,700 packed the aging Freeman Coliseum near downtown to see if the " The Little Bull " was anything like the feared fighter of years past . On the day of the fight there were lines stretching 100 yards from 10 ticket windows . <p> The fans were n't disappointed . Ayala , though balding and thickened around the middle , thrilled them by stopping Manuel Esparza in the third round to win his first fight in 17 years . <p> In the crowd , two women carried around a banner that said , " Hispanic women for better justice support Torito . " Others partied the night away , waving yellow signs that said : " Torito ... heee 's back . " <p> The slogan of his return was " To Hell and Back . " It seemed to fit . <p> " It was an ongoing 17-year soap opera while he was in prison , but the people of San Antonio still loved him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there . " <p> Ayala would go on to fight six times , making about $700,000 . He remarried his common-law wife , Lisa , who divorced him while he was in prison , and they bought a 3-acre spread with a swimming pool . <p> Ayala helped his father buy the gym where he trained , and there was talk of a fight with Hector Camacho that might make him $500,000 . Fueling it all was a sense of urgency to make up for 16 years of lost time in a sport where age plays no favorites . <p> " I 'm a 38-year-old man competing in a sport of 20-year-olds , " Ayala said . " It 's a lot harder than I remember it was before . " <p> Being a hometown hero , though , brought temptations Ayala could n't resist . He began going out on the town , often with Lisa in tow , and partying at bars and strip clubs . <p> Sixteen years in prison had built a big thirst . <p> " You have no idea what the transition was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled environment where they tell you every move you make to having total freedom was a shock . There were a lot of people making bets on whether or not I 'd fail . " <p> Among them was the former head of the New Jersey State Parole Board , who voted to deny Ayala parole in 1998 . <p> " I remember thinking he might do well for a while , " Andrew Consovoy said last year . " But I told my colleagues if he lost a fight no woman should be allowed within 50 miles of him . " <p> That loss finally came last July 28 when Ayala , dehydrated from trying to make weight , broke his hand in the third round and took a beating from Yory Boy Campas . <p> His father and trainer , Tony Sr. , stopped the fight at the end of the eighth round , with tears streaming down his son 's swollen eyes . <p> " It 's OK , " the elder Ayala whispered to his son . <p> Later , slumped in his dressing room , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become even better . <p> " You 're not going to see any nonsense . No arrests , " he vowed . <p> Ayala had been drinking for some time before the loss . Waiting for his hand to heal , he began partying even more . <p> Raditz warned Ayala he was drinking too much , though he would often join him on his trips around town . <p> " I thought it would be safer at times for me to be there , " Raditz said . " He fooled himself with the drinking and he let it get away from him . We talked about it , but sometimes people ca n't recognize they have a problem . " <p> The night he was shot , Ayala was drinking heavily at a strip joint called Babe 's Men 's Club . He argued with his wife and walked out with a stripper . <p> Ayala showed up a short time later at a modest wood-frame home where a couple and their two children shared space with Gomez , a girl who befriended Ayala and his wife while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez was sleeping on a couch in the living room when she opened her eyes to see a dark figure standing across the room . She ran to another room , shaking her friend and saying , " Somebody 's in the house ! " <p> The women confronted Ayala in the kitchen , ordering him not to move . When he began coming forward , Gomez fired the gun . <p> Ayala was drunk but he remembers it clearly . There was a burning in his shoulder and blood streaming down his back . He sat down on the floor , waiting for police and an ambulance . <p> Ayala was indicted on charges of burglary and intent to commit assault and sexual assault , charges that could bring a life prison sentence when he goes on trial Aug. 13 . <p> " What 's crazy is these charges of intent , " Ayala said . " Nothing ever happened . How do you show intent as I was walking out ? I was shot at the rear of the house while I was leaving . " <p> Raditz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have . <p> " If he had a need to do an assault , he would have done it . Nothing ever stopped him from doing it before , " Raditz said . " But he resolved his demons many years ago . The need to attack and hurt does n't exist at all . " <p> Do n't be so sure , others say . <p> " I think she was damn lucky to have a gun , " Zdobinski said . <p> Even those like Bedford , who promoted many of Ayala 's fights , are n't so sure anymore . <p> " I 'm wanting very badly to think he was just there for another reason other than to commit a crime , " Bedford said . <p> Ayala , meanwhile , continues to train in the small gym west of downtown where fight posters speak of happier times . He 's broke , owes money to the IRS , and needs his July 31 fight to help pay bills . <p> Lisa left him after the arrest and filed for divorce again , and he wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm toiling on the edge of losing everything , " he said . <p> Ayala goes to AA meetings daily and has his urine tested several times a week . He must wear the ankle monitor as a condition for his release on $100,000 bail . <p> He trains for a fight that could determine his boxing future . A much bigger fight , though , looms in the courtroom . <p> " I do n't fear going back to prison , but I do n't want to , " he said . " I enjoy my freedom and I 'm willing to fight and die for my freedom . But if I go back I 'll survive one way or another . I did it for 16 years , and I can do it again . "
