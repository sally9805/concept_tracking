Surprisingly small changes in your everyday habits can reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases . Here are some of the best moves you can make . // Do n't look now , but your body is conspiring against you . Every time you 've ever stressed over work issues , skipped out on needed exercise or simply pushed your vegetables to the side of the plate , your body has been busy remembering and making you pay for it ever since . Hypertension , adult-onset diabetes , cancer , heart disease and most other major diseases are more the result of how you have treated yourself in the past than genetics , says Pamela M. Peeke , M.D. , M.P.H. , assistant clinical professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and author of Fight Fat After Forty ( Viking , 2000 ) . Neglecting seemingly small things in your lifestyle can have a cumulative effect that usually does n't show itself until serious damage has been done . " Taking the critical steps that can change your life for the better does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice , " Peeke says . Photograph Worried your stressful life could hurt your health ?

Steps to take : Catnap ; drink HO ; maintain a healthy weight ; and get to bed at the same time every night . Photograph Declutter your life ; add resistance training to your workout ; opt for bright vegetables . // With the help of a few experts , we found seven surprisingly simple changes that you can make right now , and any single one can improve your health significantly without requiring as much effort as you would expect . If you 're ready to change your life for the better , these easy-to-follow tips may be your best approach . Get more hours of sleep . The average woman needs eight-anda-half to nine hours of sleep , but typically gets only six to seven . That one- to two-hour loss can have more bad effects than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that sleep deprivation can affect every aspect of how the body functions , from the ability to memorize and logically reason to the repair of neurons and development of muscle , " says Paul T. Gross , M.D. , director of the sleep disorders center at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington , Mass . Finding time for an extra hour or two of sleep a day can decrease your risk of being affected , but to boost bedtime , aim to : Go to bed and wake up at a set time every day , even on your days off . " Sleeping in " on weekends can disrupt your sleep cycle later in the week . Stay away from alcohol for at least two hours before bedtime . Alcohol may make you sleepy , but it also prevents REM sleep , the deepest kind of rest , making whatever sleep you manage to get less restorative . Take a nap . Snagging a 15- to 20-minute nap between I and 4 p.m. can improve your alertness , sharpen your memory and help reduce fatigue . If your schedule does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alertness for less mentally demanding activities . Watch when you work out . Exercising for at least 20-30 minutes a day promotes sleep , but avoid working out for at least four to six hours before bedtime . Revving up your body and releasing adrenaline may keep you too alert to pass out when you need to . " By the time you get thirsty , your body is already about 2 percent low on water , " says Susan Kleiner , Ph.D. , R.D. , author of Power Eating ( Human Kinetics , 1998 ) . " Losing just 1-2 percent of your body weight in fluid can lower your physical and mental performance by up to 20 percent . " This syndrome , known as chronic mild dehydration , can negatively affect every function of the body . " All biochemical connections throughout the body either occur in water or use water as a conduit , " Kleiner explains . " If you are not well hydrated , everything from joint lubrication , digestion and reproduction to breathing can be compromised . " The minimum amount of water every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly 72 ounces ) . " Yet most women only get around five to six glasses , " Kleiner says . Adding just 24 extra ounces each day ( three glasses ) can correct this . To make drinking more water much easier to swallow : Switch to a larger glass . Mealtimes are prime opportunities to get more water ; so to use them to easily get more H , O , simply reach for a glass that 's slightly larger than the one you typically use . Add an ounce of fruit juice . Mixing in a very small amount of orange , lemon or lime juice ( or even a hint of vanilla extract ) can add just enough flavor to make drinking plain old water a bit more palatable . Compensate when having caffeine . Ca n't kick your coffee or diet-cola habit ? For every caffeinated beverage you drink , consume 8 ounces of water alongside it . Not only will that extra water help maintain your fluid levels , it may even prevent you from consuming as much caffeine as you usually would . Eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins and antioxidative phytochemicals , vegetables can make a profound difference in decreasing your risk of obesity , certain types of cancer , gastrointestinal problems and a host of other diseases , " says Joy Bauer , M.S. , R.D. , author of The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Eating Smart ( Alpha Books , 1997 ) . But most women get only about half as many vegetable servings as they should each day . If you 're like many women , you may tend to eat garden-grown items only at lunch and dinner . So try sneaking veggies into your morning meals . To boost your daily intake as much as 33 percent , add spinach and mushrooms to your breakfast omelet , put a slice of tomato on your toast and drink a glass of carrot juice . And to maximize your daily intake : Add one new vegetable each week . Instead of always sticking with vegetables you know , make a point of trying one new type ( such as bok choy , kale , broccolini or butternut squash ) every week . " By making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll eat more vegetables regularly without even realizing it , " Bauer says . Opt for the brightest in the bunch . In general , it does n't matter what color a vegetable is , so long as that color is bright . The richer the color , the more nutrient  --  dense the vegetable is , whether it 's bright yellow , red , orange or green . Add resistance exercise to your regular routine . " By the time you 're 25 , a sedentary life works against you , " says Heather Dillinger , national certification specialist for the Aerobic and Fitness Association of America . That 's because the average woman 's metabolism begins to slow down in her late 20s to early 30s , due to a loss of about 1/2-1 pound of muscle ( which burns 35-50 calories a day ) every year This translates into a slowed metabolism , which increases body fat . Compensating for these natural changes just takes incorporating regular resistance training into your week . To keep those unwanted pounds off for good , add a few extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can even extend your life . If squeezing any more exercise into your life seems impossible , aim to : Choose compound exercises instead of isolation movements . " Women tend to dedicate their workouts to exercises that only work one muscle group at a time , " Dillinger says . Using compound moves such as lunges , squats , dumbbell presses and pull-ups , which work several muscle groups together , can make your gym time more productive and multiply your results . Make working out a priority . Trying to leave a meeting or event by using exercise as an excuse never seems justifiable to most people , or to your conscience . " Make each and every workout a standing appointment , " Dillinger says . No one at work needs to know where you 're going or what you 're doing . All anyone needs to hear is that you have a commitment somewhere else . Crunch in between . Instead of saving your crunches for last , after you 've finished working your butt , back and legs , do a set of crunches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not only turn your routine into a circuit that burns more calories , but you 'll finish your ab routine without ever feeling like you 've started , giving you a few extra minutes for more exercise . Let go of one stressful thing each week . " Unrelieved stress affects almost every function of the body , causing insomnia , high blood pressure , constipation , depression and an assortment of anxiety-driven aches and pains , " says Pamela Peeke . Left untreated , the longterm effects of stress are much more serious , contributing to heart disease , ulcers , immune-system deficiencies and hypertension . And what 's causing your stress may surprise you . " Most women 's stress comes from simply not knowing if they 're on target with their lives , " says Julie Morgenstern , founder and owner of Task Masters in New York City and author of Time Management From the Inside Out ( Henry Holt , 2000 ) . Stopping to figure out one or two bigpicture goals for the six major areas of life ( family , work , finance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you have well-defined goals , they become amazing filters to sift what is important from what is n't , bringing into your life a perspective that can lower stress and the amount of disease  --  inflicting cortisol that comes along with it . To be sure you are investing your time wisely , use these guidelines : Organize your personal life like your office . " Most people waste an average of three hours each day when they do n't plan what to do next , " Morgenstern says . Structuring certain parts of your home ( such as setting aside a section to pay bills with a bills box , letter opener and your checkbook or keeping a basket for newspapers and magazines next to your favorite reading chair ) just like your office ( according to your priorities ) can help make sure your downtime is just as efficient . Give yourself five every hour . Getting enough " me " time is something most people never seem to do . Instead of trying to save up time for the end of your busy day , step away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking a walk . reading a personal letter or doing something small that makes you happy , but that also wo n't keep you from your duties and create additional stress , can make a world of difference in your day , " Morgenstern says . Learn to dissipate anger . Staying angry creates competitive situations that make us unnecessarily aggressive , even at " rest . " Instead of holding on to negative feelings or viewing yourself as a victim , let feelings go by reconciling , restructuring or , if necessary , even ending relationships . Be clear about how you need to be treated , and teach others how to treat you . Photograph Eat a low-fat snack before your main meal . // Lose a few pounds " If you 're overweight , dropping just 5-10 percent of your total body weight can have a profound effect on reducing your chances of many cardiovascular and arterial complications , as well as a variety of weight-induced diseases , " says Jeff Novick , M.S. , R.D. , L.D. , director of nutrition for the Florida Pritikin Longevity Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet that derives less than 30 percent of its calories from fat can help , but shaving additional calories can take a few tweaks in what you 're used to . To lose those last stubborn pounds , aim to : Eat six to seven smaller meals instead of three large ones . This may feel like a backward step from weight loss , but spreading your daily calorie intake among several small meals can help curb binges . Eat as if you 're broke when dining out . Vegetable and other plant-based meals ( such as veggie fajitas or vegetable lo mein , for example ) tend to cost a dollar or so less than meat-based entrees . Look for the cheapest items on the menu , and chances are , you 'll find meals that contain less fat and more nutrition than the rest of the fare . Count fiber , not calories . " Research has shown that individuals who eat more fiber tend to gain less weight , " Novick says . Foods that are naturally high in fiber tend to have fewer calories and leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 25-35 grams of fiber each day . Have a low-energy-density dish before every major meal . A Pennsylvania State University study has shown that eating a low-fat , low-energy-density dish ( filled with fruits , vegetables and other foods rich in water and fiber , such as soup ) before a main meal can reduce the total amount of calories consumed during the entire meal by 26 percent . Get an annual medical exam " Many of the health issues that affect women as they get older actually start showing up in their late teens and early 20s , " says Pamela Peeke . " For nine out of 10 women , their **25;787;TOOLONG ends up acting as their primary-care physician , offering an annual exam that typically centers on the reproductive system . " However , a family doctor has the means-to perform lab tests such as cholesterol screening and checking skin growths that should be monitored regularly . To get the best of both worlds , pick a physician who 's either an internist or family practitioner to perform your annual check-up . Both can perform all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do . To get the most from your checkup : Share your sexual history with your doctor . If you 're sexually active and nonmonogamous , informing your doctor about your past encounters can give her an indication of which sexually transmitted diseases you may have been exposed to and should be tested for Get a complete blood count . Many women are prone to anemia from excessive menstrual bleeding and eating lowcalorie diets lacking iron-rich meats . If your total blood count is low , Peeke recommends asking for a ferritin test , an iron-specific examination that can determine if you may be at risk . Request a urinalysis . A urine test can detect abnormal kidney functioning . Finding unusual things such as red blood cells in the urine can detect early kidney disease , while excess sugar could reveal if you 're pre-diabetic . " Given the recent 76 percent increase in adult-onset ( Type 11 ) diabetes , this simple test can prevent a lifetime of discomfort , " Peeke says .
