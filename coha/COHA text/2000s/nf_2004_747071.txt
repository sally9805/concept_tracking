Section : Features : Ecuador Race and politics in Ecuador <p> In August 14 , Salvador Quishpe , an indigenous member of the Ecuadorian Congress representing the Pachakutik indigenous political movement , was publicly punished with a cold bath and beaten with the sharp-edged ortiga plant for not voting with the Pachakutik bloc in Congress . The nightly news showed images of Quishpe in his underwear silently looking down while dozens of activists carried out the punishment for all the country to see . His offense was voting with President Lucio Gutirrez 's Sociedad Patriotica Party ( PSP ) for a bureaucratic labor reform that Pachakutik opposed . In addition to the bath and the beating , Quishpe was forced to sign a document accepting that he would be removed from Pachakutik if he goes against the movement again . Manuel Cholanga , an activist with the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador ( CONAIE ) , stated , " we will not permit acts of indiscipline . " <p> While the mainstream media viewed this incident as an example of the indigenous law of customs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more was at stake . Quishpe 's punishment occurred during the same week that Gutirrez broke off his pact with Pachakutik and asked all of the movement 's ministers and other public officials to step down . Quishpe 's support of the PSP 's position was , at the very least , a public embarrassment to a party that had just been shunned by the president . <p> More important , Quishpe 's action and the punishment itself should be read as events that played out , or " staged , " two important and interrelated tensions that have plagued the national indigenous movement since its inception : the difficulty of maintaining alliances with mestizos that do not ultimately disempower Indians , and the representativeness of indigenous leaders who acquire national power . A History of Tense Alliances <p> The first institutionalized efforts to mobilize indigenous political participation in the twentieth century were the result of the relationship established between urban mestizo socialists and indigenous hacienda workers in the northern Ecuadorian highlands . In the 1930s , the Ecuadorian Federation of Indians ( FEI ) was created under the umbrella of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacienda land conflicts , but while these obtained important gains , they were characterized by limited indigenous leadership and mestizo control over most planning and decision-making . <p> In the 1960s and 1970s , leftist unionism and the Catholic Church played an important role in helping create local and national organizations . The first highland organization , ECUARUNARI , emerged under the tutelage of Catholic activists and the Christian left . From the start , however , indigenous leaders were troubled by conflicts between the Catholics and the leftists and by the perceived paternalism of mestizo leaders from both groups , who were pressuring Indians to take their side in the dispute . Young indigenous activists grew tired of what they called ideological paternalism and decided to exclude mestizos from organization meetings and high-level leadership positions . This marked the creation of the first national-level organization with exclusively indigenous leadership . <p> In the late 1970s and early 1980s , Indians experienced similar difficulties with mestizos in their relationships with labor unions and leftist political parties . Controversies erupted over political platforms that privileged class over ethnic demands and urban concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collectively , to subordinate positions in popular fronts and electoral campaigns . Even in local elections , Indians were often expected to deliver mass votes to the left but were not themselves placed on the ballot . The irony was not lost on the activists : Indians were struggling for equality but confronted deeply embedded structural and cultural inequalities in that struggle . <p> These experiences help explain the creation in 1986 of CONAIE as an exclusively indigenous organization that sought to create a separate political space to preserve some political autonomy . In its early years , CONAIE organized workshops , conferences and meetings to assess the social and political conditions that specifically affected Indians . CONAIE also sought to develop political strategies . But despite its enormous success in spearheading several national uprisings in the 1990s , the organization remained absent from electoral politics for 10 years . Its leaders considered electoral politics tainted and corrupt , and they distrusted mestizo politicians ability to fulfill their commitments to Indians upon being elected . <p> Efforts to organize with mestizos occurred in the early 1990s , as CONAIE joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marches against neoliberal policies . These alliances were different from the earlier ones . They were confined to specific events and , more important , they were based on mutual respect and equal power sharing in decision-making . This change was due in large part to the growing clout of the indigenous social movement . Finally , in 1996 , Pachakutik-Nuevo Pas was created as a political movement to support candidates in elections . While Pachakutik relies primarily on indigenous votes , it has also placed numerous non-indigenous candidates on the ballot . In 1996 , Pachakutik won 80 local elected offices and five congressional seats . The 1998 and 2000 elections resulted in additional electoral gains . As mayors , council representatives and members of Congress , indigenous leaders established political coalitions with mestizo politicians and worked on broad policy issues that affected all racial groups in Ecuador . Throughout these experiences , Pachakutik representatives have insisted on power sharing on an equal basis and underscored the importance of indigenous participation in all Ecuadorian affairs , and not only " indigenous issues . " <p> Once Pachakutik went beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel to oust President Jamil Mahuad in January 2000 , new limitations of indigenous-mestizo alliances became apparent . The temporary government created with a cadre of junior military officials ( including Gutirrez ) and indigenous leadership lasted only a few hours . High-ranking members of the military undermined the temporary government and elevated the former vice president , Gustave Noboa , to the presidency . Indigenous leaders learned that that the military , like other mestizo sectors and parties , was easily divided and did not represent a collective whole . They also saw that others , including the right , had benefited from their labor without incurring any of the cost . The Noboa administration was more right leaning and repressive than the one that Indians had helped remove . Dual Identities <p> The rise of Pachakutik has added complexity to the second important source of tensions within the indigenous movement : representation . The question of who represents Indians in Ecuador is not an easy one . The role of syndicalism and religion in the creation of indigenous organizations has led to the emergence of two other national federations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Confederation of Peasant , Indigenous and Black Organizations ( FENOCIN ) . Both have played an important role in organizing mass mobilizations and supporting Pachakutik and its candidates . However , they conflicted with CONAIE when this organization nominated its own leaders to be the movement 's representatives in the Council for the Development of the Nationalities and People of Ecuador ( CODEN PE ) , a publicly funded national committee that overviews indigenous development projects carried out by the Ecuadorian Indigenous People 's Development Project ( PRODEPINE ) with World Bank funding . FENOC and FEINE complained that CONAIE was excluding their leadership and therefore not representing the different indigenous constituents . This bitter struggle was resolved when activists decided to drop institutional affiliations and elect leaders of each ethnic group . This has proved to be a complicated change , because many Indians of Quichua origin , especially , had not previously self-identified or organized as Quichuas but rather as members of local indigenous organizations . <p> The creation of Pachakutik adds another layer to the question of representation . Pachakutik is the political arm of CONAIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given it support . Activists have opted not to transform the social movement into a political movement , but rather to have both coexist separately . For example , once CONAIE leaders make the transition to Pachakutik , they no longer remain active in the social organization . At different moments , Pachakutik and CONAIE activists have disagreed about political strategies . However , Pachakutik leaders , in order to remain representative , must be supported by the indigenous social organizations . In exchange for this support , Pachakutik representatives are held accountable to these organizations . They are expected to keep their best interests in mind and to negotiate any differences directly with movement leaders . Rather than individual politicians elected by aggregated votes , they are viewed as the representatives of a collective . For many indigenous activists , this distinguishes indigenous forms of politics and indigenous politicians from nonindigenous ones . <p> The unusual coexistence of separate indigenous social and political movements reflects leaders ' acknowledgement of the fact that indigenous power in Ecuador relies on the potential for mobilization and disruption . Since 1990 , indigenous mobilizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ousted two presidents . Elected politicians must now consider the threat of indigenous mobilization before making policy decisions . Unlike many civil rights movements and armed insurgency groups in other countries , the Ecuadorian indigenous movement has no plans to relinquish mobilization politics for electoral politics . Instead , it has adopted a dual political path . This decision can lead to the unusual situation of being in power and in the opposition at the same time . A local example of this is the case of Pedro de la Cruz , president of the Peasant and Indigenous Organization of Cotacachi ( UNORCIC ) and an elected city council member , who occupied the Cotacachi municipality building in 1991 to protest discrimination against indigenous elected officials . His experience reminds us that the need to rely on the power of disruption is evidence of the incomplete inclusion of Indians in the Ecuadorian polity . Like the events following the 2000 coup , it also indicates the reluctance of nonindigenous Ecuadorians to accept increased indigenous power . The Collapse of Power Sharing <p> Fast forward to 2002 . The electoral alliance established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to power in November of that year . The election was considered an unprecedented political victory for Pachakutik and the indigenous movement as a whole . Finally , Indians were going to participate in a governing coalition . However , the Gutirrez-Pachakutik electoral alliance never became an effective governing alliance . From the outset , it was riddled by internal conflicts that ultimately led to Pachakutik 's departure in August 2003 , barely seven months after Gutirrez 's inauguration . <p> Why did this alliance go sour so quickly ? Clearly , Gutirrez and indigenous political leaders had very different assumptions about how power would be shared . Before his election , Gutirrez and PSP leadership held regular meetings with indigenous leaders from Pachakutik , CONAIE , FEINE and FENOCIN to discuss future public policy . After leading the first round of voting with massive indigenous support , Gutirrez reduced these meetings to a minimum and assumed that occasional communication with Pachakutik representatives was sufficient . He concentrated on establishing links with business elites and the political right in an effort to gain their support in the run-off election and win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his final victory , Pachakutik leaders publicly reminded Gutirrez to incorporate them in his plans . As part of their project for indigenous co-government , they insisted on several ministries for Pachakutik , and the negotiations that followed resulted in three ministries and several intermediate positions in the state bureaucracy for the movement . As far as Gutirrez was concerned , these positions settled the score with Pachakutik . In return , he expected complete loyalty at the executive and congressional levels . <p> Indigenous leaders , however , saw the sharing of administrative positions as only the beginning of joint decision-making and a shared policy platform . Gutirrez and his advisors in the PSP never fulfilled these expectations . As a consequence , Indians were placed in the position of being simultaneously in government and the opposition . Differences among indigenous activists surfaced , with more moderate leaders wanting to give the Gutirrez presidency some time to allow Pachakutik leaders to carry out their mandate in office . Others began to react negatively to what they considered Gutierrez 's undemocratic and unconditioned negotiations with the IMF and his continued approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-time nemesis of the indigenous movement . At the executive level , Gutierrez 's agreement to allow PSC Mayor Jaime Nebot to municipalize social security in the port city of Guayaquil was the last straw for indigenous leaders . The president himself lost patience in Congress , where Pachakutik voted against the public labor bill necessary for IMF disbursement of funds . On August 6 , 2003 , he declared the alliance broken . <p> What caused the alliance to fail ? For most experts on Ecuadorian politics , the question is rather , how could it not fail ? The alliance was extremely vulnerable from the beginning . Gutirrez faced the challenge of straddling those forces that support neoliberal reforms , open markets and privatization , and those that vehemently oppose these initiatives , in what is becoming an increasingly polarized society . The conflict is compounded by the fact that the opposition is regionalized and racialized : The PSC 's stronghold is in the racially mixed Ecuadorian coast , while Pachakutik 's support lies in the indigenous highlands and certain lowland areas . <p> On a deeper level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics of indigenous mestizo-alliances and indigenous representation in Ecuador . Gutirrez gained power because of indigenous backing , and his ability to sustain it has also been conditioned , in part , on that support . However , he refused to share power equally with the indigenous movement , and was unwilling to recognize that co-governing included the social movement organizations and not solely the individuals from Pachakutik selected to join his cabinet . Moreover , he would not recognize the dual dimension of indigenous power or learn to work with it . He demanded to know how Indians could be both in the government and in the opposition , and used this apparent contradiction as the basis to ask for their departure . <p> The indigenous position , in contrast , is illustrated by Salvador Quishpe 's punishment . In siding with the mestizo PSP and the mestizo president who had betrayed the movement , he was voting not only against Pachakutik but also against CONAIE , FENOCIN , FEINE and multiple provincial and local activists . From the perspective of his punishers , in making an individual choice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opting for the mestizo political path of " each for his own . " His act called up memories of an era in which Indians could not express their own voices , but were represented by non-indigenous liberal thinkers - the " ventriloquists , " as Andres Guerrero has called them . It also alluded to a more recent period of leftist paternalism and unequal power sharing , reproducing the political subordination that indigenous activists had struggled so hard to escape . Punishing Quishpe was a reminder to all that Indians as a political collective must be represented by Indians who uphold that ideal or else be prepared to face the consequences . <p> In Ecuador , where indigenous identity is deeply politicized , political actions have become markers of race . Quishpe 's denial of the collective constituted as much a betrayal as if he had cut off his braid and worn mestizo clothing . The use of a traditional punishment was a reminder to him and to all Ecuadorians not only of his Indianess , but also of the importance of indigenous political ideals at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Amalia Pallares <p>
