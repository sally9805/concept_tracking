Person of the Year <P> " Too often we take for granted our freedoms and those who serve to protect them . Thank you for recognizing such deserving people . " DAVID EADIE Fredericksburg , Va . <P> I have fond memories of my family 's noisy , heated discussions about whom TIME would select as Person of the Year Dec. 29  --  Jan. 5 . Whoever guessed right had bragging rights for the next year . I applaud your wonderful choice of the American soldier . These men and women most likely did not expect to go to war when they signed up , yet there they are , day after day , doing their job , fighting for freedom . They deserve our thanks , support , accolades and prayers . FRANCINE M. SCUDERI Stewart Manor , N.Y . <P> The designation of the American soldier as Person of the Year brought a lump to this old soldier 's throat and is a fitting tribute to today 's generation . These young people have proved that we old veterans can now relax , knowing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect the selection was a very difficult one , as so many newsmakers , good and bad , were in contention . May I congratulate your staff for a truly spectacular choice ! RICHARD BROWN , U.S. ARMY ( RET . ) Springfield , Mo . <P> I 'm sure you made your choice with the best intentions . I am worried , however , that it reflects a country too much in love with its own military might . The U.S. 's armed forces are an extension of American foreign policy , not the savior of the world . To start thinking of service members as infallible crusaders for freedom is delusional and dangerous to the rest of the world . Let 's remember what our military really is : a group of Americans sworn to defend the freedom of the U.S. and its Constitution . They are not the U.N . ' s Blue Helmets , dedicated to keeping peace around the globe . LANCE CPL . PAUL METCALF , U.S.M.C. Okinawa <P> I was extremely upset by TIME 's selection . While you were right to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armed forces from other nations that are fighting alongside the Americans . George W. Bush and Tony Blair are trying to portray the Iraq conflict as one fought by the international community against evil and tyranny . TIME needs to provide an explanation to the families of Italian , Spanish , British and Polish soldiers who have fought and died in Iraq . Why were n't their lives and sacrifices recognized as noble and noteworthy like those of Americans ? MAREK WITKO London <P> I was overcome with pride and emotion by your selection . At age 22 , my son is , like countless others , a " war veteran . " He has served twice in Afghanistan and is preparing for deployment to Iraq . I 'm grateful to TIME for looking past the glitter and gloss of celebrities to say " Thank you " to our true American heroes . BEVERLY D. GENDA Greenville , N.C. <P> Although I feel great sympathy and even a certain admiration for what the U.S. military is doing in Iraq , the choice of the American soldier as Person of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to select a symbol of man 's continuing and predictable stupidity . If a great and powerful nation like the U.S. can not find a more compassionate and creative way to deal with international discord , we are all doomed . FRANCOIS HEBERT Montreal
