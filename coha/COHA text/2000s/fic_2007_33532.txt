May 30 Dear little brother , you whispered when you gave me this pale green book with the blank pages . You did n't want Uncle Rubel and our mother to hear us talking . I do n't know why . Ami would n't care . But Uncle Rubel ? Is he mean to you when I am away ? At least he gives us a place to live . I do n't want to speak ill of any of our relations , of course , but I am not certain Baba liked him either . I miss our father so much . Will we ever get used to him being gone , Umar ? I wish you remembered when we lived in the village , before the bad thing happened and we had to move to Karachi . Baba owned a store and was well respected . We had a house . It was small , but I had my own room . At this time of year , you could smell the wildflowers that grew in a small patch near the spring , especially these blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Baba would laugh and ask if she could hear them ringing . Ami had several saris and dupattas then  --  made from the softest silks , with the most becoming colors . She was much admired , our mother . But then our brother Rahman was accused , and I got hurt . That is not the story you want to hear tonight , though , is it ? You wanted me to write stories about my life in Begum Naseem 's house ( where I work as a servant ) and then read them to you when I visit on myday off . I will try to do that , little brother . You are only six years old . I know you will not like hearing this , but you are too young for some things . Like the story of how I got hurt  --  even though you are the only person I have ever let touch the scar on my face . You said , " It looks like the new moon we watch for at the end of Ramadan . " You grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate . Just like I celebrate every time you come home ! " And you asked if it hurt . I told you no , but it does hurt . Every time I look in the mirror  --  which is not often  --  and I move my dupatta away from my cheek , my heart hurts to see what they did to me . Why am I talking about this ? It must be Uncle Rubel . I do not want to be unkind , Umar , but he reminds me of the men from the village . And that makes me shudder . I do n't like him talking to Ami about money . I give her all my pay , little as it is . It must be enough to pay for you both , plus our brothers send money . Or they used to . I am not certain now what they do . Anyway , you gave me the little green book and showed me your little red book . I wonder how long it was before he died that Baba packed the books in the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written " Nadira " on the first blank page of my book and " Umar " on the first blank page of your book . " Remember Shahrazad , " he wrote to me in the green book . " Learn wisely , " he wrote to you in the red book . Do you think he knew he was going to die ? It was very hard for him to lose everything . I was only thirteen when we left the village . He tried for four years to make our life better here . I think it hurt him that our brothers did not come home to help . Maybe they never realized how bad things had gotten . I do n't think I will read you everything I write here . I am writing too many sad things , even though I do n't feel sad . Fatima , another servant here , is snoring next to me . I should be sleeping , but I am remembering telling you stories tonight before I left , like Baba used to tell me when I was your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope Ami sends you to school and does n't listen to Uncle Rubel . You should not be working at your age ! Whatever happens , I will make certain you learn to read and write . Fatima found me a pencil to use to write in this little green book . I can hide it in the book and put both in my pocket . Tonight I told you the story of Shahrazad , the very wise and beautiful woman who saved herself and all the young women of the kingdom . The King was mad with grief because his first wife betrayed him . He would not risk another betrayal , so he took a new wife each night and had the new wife killed each morning . One day , Shahrazad asked her father to put her name forward as the next bride . Her father tried to talk her out of this dangerous course . She told him that she had learned all her lessons well . " Trust me , " she told her father . Her father eventually did as she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked her husband for one last favor . Could she tell her sister one last story ? He agreed . And she told the story , and it was night again . So he spared her life that night . And she told another story and another . Each night for one thousand and one nights , Shahrazad told a story that saved her life , until the King finally decided she had told enough stories and he allowed her to live . That 's how we got Alf Layla wa-Layla , A Thousand Nights and One Night . Even though Baba says Shahrazad was not a historical person , I believe someone like her existed . Maybe many someones like her . When Baba first told me this tale , I said , " A King can kill people ? " Baba said , " A King can do anything . But he has someone he must answer to  --  even if it is his own conscience . Everyone has someone like the King in their lives . Shahrazad was clever . She did n't wait for her fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me tell you a story . ' And she saved her own life . No sense crying and wailing over how terrible your life is . Someone always has it worse . Someone always has it better . " Before you went to sleep tonight , Umar , you said , " I want to see the moon . " " But we have no window , " I said . You gently pulled my scarf away until you could see my scar . I leaned down , and you kissed it . I will never have a husband , and I will probably always be a servant in a household like this one , but I have the best brother in the world . Your breath on my cheek  --  on my scar  --  felt like the breath of Allah . You said , " Promise you will never leave me . " " I promise , " I said . " Promise you will never leave me . " " Never , " you said . Good night , sweet brother . Dream of the two of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flying far far from here . Your loving sister , Nadira
