The surgeon took aim at his patient 's naked beating heart with a bent plastic nozzle . The thing looked like something borrowed from a water faucet . <p> But it was a laser gun , the hot end of a 2,000-pound machine , and the surgeon was about to burn a hole clear through the woman 's left ventricle , the main pumping chamber of her heart . <p> " Arm laser ! " he ordered . <p> A red dot of light showed exactly where the laser beam would hit . He held the gun against the fat-streaked heart , pulsing like a nervous animal inside the open chest . <p> The surgeon stepped on a foot pedal . Thud . Gray-white smoke puffed from an exquisitely round hole , followed by a little geyser of blood . <p> " Hit ? " the surgeon asked . An anesthesiologist watched the result on an ultrasound screen . A dark cloud blossomed inside the heart . Vaporized blood . " Yes , " came the reply . <p> Until that moment , the operation had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States each year . Dr. Keith Horvath , the surgeon , had spent three hours stitching wormlike strands of vein and artery onto the woman 's heart , detouring blood around her clogged blood vessels . <p> The laser , however , was something new . Horvath moved the gun a fraction of an inch and fired again . Ten minutes and 17 holes later , he was done . <p> What the surgeon accomplished with this final flourish - so elegant yet crude - is something no one can say beyond a doubt . <p> Horvath hoped that he improved his patients ' chances of escaping bad chest pain , that he increased the flow of blood to parts of the heart muscle that would not be helped by the bypass operation . <p> But did he ? Or had he just added several thousand dollars to the patient 's hospital bill for no good reason ? <p> The questions are the core of a debate over an unusual piece of medical technology . Those who believe in the laser say it can profoundly relieve otherwise unmanageable angina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly often do - some wonder if the laser is simply an expensive placebo , a surgical version of the sugar pill . <p> Two competing versions of the laser have been on the market for over two years , and many thought it would be used more widely by now . But the technology has been held back in part by a public relations problem : Drilling holes through the heart is an odd thing to do , and no one can explain with certainty why it works . If in fact it does . <p> " The technology is not intuitive , " concedes Mark Tauscher , head of PLC Medical Systems , one of the two companies selling the lasers . " When you tell people that you burn a hole in people 's hearts and make them feel better , they do n't say , ' Aha ! I understand . " ' <p> The idea of drilling holes through the heart has been around since the 1980s . Early advocates supposed the holes would act like new blood vessels , bringing blood directly from the pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this theory has been largely refuted . It turns out the holes quickly fill up with clots and then heal . Within a few months , they disappear . <p> Nevertheless , drilling holes in the heart does something . Between half and three-quarters of patients studied have dramatic relief from chest pain . <p> " In 20 years of medicine , I have never seen anything that gives as much symptomatic benefit for patients , " says Dr. William O'Neill of William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak , Mich . <p> O'Neill is a cardiologist , a non-surgical heart specialist , and he has tested a still experimental form of heart laser that is delivered into the heart through a tube called a catheter . Instead of burning holes from the outside in , as the surgeons do , this technique burns notches into the walls of the heart from the inside . <p> Practically every doctor who has tried the laser , whether the surgical or catheter variety , tells stories of almost unbelievable recoveries . Among O'Neill 's patients is Frank Warren , 41 , an auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heart problems for almost 10 years . Sometimes it was a burning sensation , other times a pain that came on even while resting . He had no energy . The slightest exercise was exhausting . Over the years he underwent eight angioplasties , but nothing helped . <p> " After the laser , I felt immediate results , " says Warren . " I felt a warmth in my face . My color seemed to change . I made a decision right there on the table that if this thing worked , I would begin to try to run . " <p> He started out in rehab . He walked and eventually took up running , first a half mile and then longer . Almost a year to the day after his laser , Warren ran a marathon and finished in a respectable four hours , 29 minutes . <p> Most laser patients are too old to run marathons , but substantial and even complete relief of angina is common . Often they are able to give up nitroglycerin , the medicine they take , often in large quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80-year-old man who could not even wash himself , " remembers Washington University cardiologist John Lasala . " Then I got calls from family members the next week saying , ' Dad 's out gardening . " ' <p> Such anecdotes are impressive , but doctors prefer large-scale follow-up studies to make sure the successes are more than flukes . The longest of these was compiled by Horvath at Chicago 's Northwestern Memorial Hospital . <p> Doctors grade angina symptoms on a scale of 1 to 4 . Horvath followed the progress of 78 patients whose scores averaged 3.7 . Five years after their laser treatments , most were still considerably better . Eighty-one percent had scores of 2 or lower , and 17 percent had no angina at all . The average was 1.6 . <p> These data convince many that laser 's benefits are real . Perhaps patients could will themselves to feel better for a few months , the thinking goes , but not five years . <p> " A placebo effect does n't work that long , " says Dr. David Faxon , cardiology chief at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , I want that placebo . " <p> However , Horvath 's data are not the kind of gold-standard research that settles all doubt . For that , doctors would have to randomly give people real laser operations or fake ones - without telling anyone who got what - and then compare the results . Such a study will not be done for the surgical laser because doctors can not cut patients open for sham operations . <p> However , such a study can be done with the catheter laser , since the comparison group is exposed to nothing more dangerous than a routine heart checkup called an angiogram . Doctors tested an experimental catheter laser this way on 298 patients with severe , untreatable chest pain . <p> The volunteers - sedated but awake - were randomly assigned to get the laser or not . Doctors talked about lasers within earshot , leaving the impression that everyone was getting the real thing . The results , released in October , were a shock . <p> As expected , the laser patients did well , but the do-nothing group improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their angina scores by at least 2 points , even though their treatments were make-believe . <p> The study 's director , Dr. Martin B. Leon of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City , called the results more than just a blow to catheter-based lasers . He said they mean that the surgical variety , which is already approved for routine use , is also probably nothing but a fancy placebo . <p> Surgeons were angry . They point out many technical differences between the two kinds of lasers that , in their minds , make the surgical kind much better . Still , the results have increased skepticism among heart specialists who send patients to surgeons . <p> " Personally , I would n't do it now , " says Dr. Timothy Henry , a cardiologist at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis . " You are subjecting people to a procedure that has inherent dangers , and we do n't know that it works . " <p> Skeptics argue that people with bad pain can talk themselves into feeling better . They have withstood a big operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hope itself can be a painkiller , at least for a while . So they feel better and turn over a new leaf . They exercise more , eat less , quit smoking and lower their cholesterol . In time , the new habits improve the condition of their hearts . <p> Unlikely , responds Horvath . " It assumes these people have a giant epiphany as a result of this procedure and turn their lives around . That just does n't happen . " <p> And the placebo theory strikes patients as ridiculous . " I definitely find it hard to believe it 's all in my head , " says Warren , the marathon runner . " If it 's a hoax , they got me good . " <p> But if laser 's benefits are not a placebo effect , then what ? Doctors have two theories - nerve destruction and blood vessel growth . <p> Some say the laser cuts nerves in the heart . This blocks the distress signals that muscle sends when deprived of blood . Nothing really changes except that people can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser holes cause inflammation . This in turn triggers the heart to grow more tiny blood vessels , a process called angiogenesis , bringing in needed circulation . <p> Although the new-blood-vessel theory is the more popular of the two , some surgeons are skeptical . Often patients feel better the very next day - too soon for new blood vessels , which take a month or more to sprout . <p> " They come out of the operating room in pain , or they come out and say , ' I feel great , " ' says Dr. Wayne Richenbacher of the University of Iowa . " That makes absolutely no sense if you think angiogenesis is the effect . " <p> Many doctors say this uncertainty makes them uncomfortable about recommending lasers . Even some surgeons are uneasy . <p> " We 're trained to understand how things make patients better , " says Dr. Gary Marrone of Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh . " Since we do n't understand this , it makes me a little leery about doing it . " <p> When first approved for general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy for patients who could not undergo bypass surgery . But last year , Medicare agreed to pay for lasers used during bypass , as was done on a recent morning in Horvath 's operating room in Chicago . <p> The patient , a 69-year-old diabetic recovering from a heart attack , had clogged arteries . Horvath could reroute blood around three of them . But two more were too skinny and diseased to fix . That left a 3 by 4 inch section of her heart with less than optimal blood flow . <p> Until recently , surgeons would have been satisfied to do what they could . But Horvath and other advocates say the laser gives them a chance to finish the job . Last year , U.S. surgeons did about 5,000 heart laser procedures . Manufacturers estimate there could be up to 90,000 if lasers became routine during bypass surgery . <p> Two weeks after her operation , Horvath 's patient was walking without chest pain . However , it is always possible she might have fared as well with bypass alone . <p> The laser adds about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeons worry it would be an expensive mistake to burn holes in the hearts of large numbers of patients . <p> " It opens up a whole can of worms , " says Dr. Jai Lee , a surgeon at University Hospitals of Cleveland .
