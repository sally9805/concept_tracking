She lived at the time of Christ , but not for very long . By about age 5 , this little Egyptian girl , less than 4 ft. tall , had passed on to what her people believed was the next life . In preparation for the journey , her body 's internal organs  --  all except for the heart  --  had been removed and replaced with aromatic preservatives . Then she was wrapped in cloth , mummified and placed in a casing made of a papier-mch  --  like material called cartonnage . <P> There she lay for the next 2,000 years  --  first in Egypt and then for the past 80 years or so in the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San Jose , Calif . But for several months , the girl  --  who has been nicknamed Sherit , an ancient Egyptian word meaning " little one "  --  has been visiting the Stanford-NASA National Biocomputation Center in nearby Palo Alto . There , doctors and other scientists , working with imaging experts from Silicon Graphics , have been unwrapping her  --  not physically , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60,000 high-resolution X-ray images from scans that produce 35 times as much information as the scans of King Tut released earlier this year , the team has put together a three-dimensional portrait of what lies within her casing . <P> By looking at her bones , for example , the scientists determined that Sherit was probably able to walk normally and did n't have any debilitating chronic diseases . Most likely she succumbed to an infection or bad water or tainted food , as did some 50% of ancient Egyptian children within a year or two of being weaned . The bones and teeth also helped fix her age ; her adult teeth had n't grown in yet . And her gilded face mask indicated that her parents were wealthy . With higher-res scans , scientists may someday make out the hieroglyphs on the inside of the cartonnage  --  and thus , perhaps , give the little one back her rightful name .
