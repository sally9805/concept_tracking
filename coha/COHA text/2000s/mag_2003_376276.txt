Slashing your monthly car payment $100 or more may sound great , but if you 're getting that deal by signing up for a longer-term loan , you may be taking yourself for a ride . Over the past few years , loans have been lengthening , with five-year loans now common and some banks offering ones up to eight years in duration . But the longer the loan , the higher the interest rate , which means in the end you pay more , possibly thousands more . Plus , at the end of , say , eight years , you 'll own a car that 's worth very little , says Art Spinella , president of industry tracker CNW Marketing Research . A vehicle that originally cost $30,000 could resell for as little as $5,000 . If you sell the car toward the end of the loan , you might still owe more than what the car is worth . Spinella suggests sticking to a loan that lasts no longer than five years and shopping around for the best interest rate .  --  By Barbara Kiviat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
