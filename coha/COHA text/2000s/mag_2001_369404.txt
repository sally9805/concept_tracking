What 's a utility to do when it needs to keep the juice flowing but there 's nothing left to squeeze ? That 's the thorny problem facing New York City as it girds for a summer that could potentially see rolling blackouts like California 's . To stave off a meltdown in June , the city needs to have an extra 400 megawatts of electricity ( enough to power 400,000 homes ) available . But with all of New York 's red tape , you can barely get a new power plant running in six years , let alone six months . <P> Fortunately , New York has come up with a last-ditch solution  --  which , surprisingly , may be the wave of the future . Despite local community opposition , the New York power authority is racing to install 10 individual generators around the city , each capable of producing 44 megawatts . The system is tailor-made for New York , which is plagued by bottlenecks on its aging transmission lines that often make it hard to import power . <P> This approach , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . Just as the computer industry has evolved from a centralized , mainframe universe to a networked PC environment , a small but growing portion of the electricity industry is moving the power source away from one massive plant to a slew of smaller , cleaner turbines dotting the landscape . <P> It 's not just power providers that are plugging in . More and more small businesses  --  especially on the West Coast  --  are purchasing their own micro-turbines , which cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 and produce up to a megawatt of electricity , as insurance against outages . <P> " Many companies ca n't afford to be interrupted . It 's a matter of life and death , " says Dr. Ake Almgren , CEO of Capstone Turbine Corp. , which has sold more than 1,000 units in two years to outfits ranging from high-tech start-ups and hospitals to a Blockbuster Video store and a BP Amoco gas station . According to estimates , 10% to 20% of new power will be distributed by 2010 , so it 's no wonder that heavyweights like Honeywell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen Helmer , chairman of the New York State public service commission , insists that " this is just a transitional measure . " Perhaps . But for utilities grappling with NIMBYism and small businesses worried about an electricity crunch , it could be a long-term remedy . <P>  --  By Daniel Eisenberg
