Crack ! <p> Dr. Melanie Harding 's hands jerked . Seated at her scuffed wooden desk , she nearly dropped the financial statement she 'd been studying  --  the first month 's figures for her new veterinary practice . <p> Had that been a gunshot ? <p> From down the hall , dogs started barking  --  one shrill and high , the others gruff and deep . The outside noise had clearly disturbed some of the patients kept overnight for observation . It had n't been her imagination . <p> Not that she 'd really thought so . <p> She glanced across her compact office toward the far window . The sound had come from that direction . <p> She could n't see much outside from here . The moonlight , although bright , did n't do much to illuminate the yard or , beyond it , the thick woods bordering the town of Mary Glen . <p> Sure , this was n't Beverly Hills , where Melanie had come from , but it was still a civilized area , despite its somewhat remote location on Maryland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at night  --  did they ? Too dangerous to people , let alone any defenseless animals that might be their prey . <p> Melanie stood , shoving her fists into the pockets of the white lab coat she still wore , resisting the urge to race out and yell at whoever was shooting . Not that she was likely to see who it was . And if the fool was still there , any movement she might make could turn her into a target . <p> Besides , maybe it was n't a hunter . <p> Maybe it was something else . Something more sinister  --  like what had happened to her predecessor vet . <p> Despite her uneasiness , she felt compelled to glance out there . See if she could figure out what was going on . <p> Without being foolish , though . It was late , after ten o'clock , and except for her hospitalized patients she was alone here . She crossed to the open office door and flicked the switch on the beige wall beside it , turning off the overhead light . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the window . <p> She edged toward the glass , stood cautiously sideways behind its frame , and looked out . <p> The area behind her clinic was fenced in , a place where dogs could be let out for exercise and evacuation . The surface was concrete  --  not as comfortable on tender paws as grass , but easier to keep clean . <p> The enclosure was empty now , illuminated by a gorgeous full moon that hung high in the black sky , its light obscuring any stars that might otherwise be visible . <p> Beyond the yard was the dense amalgamation of poplars , oaks , dogwoods and other trees that composed the local woodlands  --  beautiful in daylight , especially now , in springtime , as some of them blossomed but darkly ominous at night . Melanie could make out the swaying of branches in the light breeze  --  like arms waving her away  --  but little else in that direction . <p> She stood still for a minute , scanning all she could see , but everything looked fine back there . Normal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even the dogs down the hall had stopped barking . <p> Sighing , Melanie shook her head . Her long , deep brown hair was caught up in a clip at the nape of her neck , as it always was when she worked . It had been a long , tiring day . But enjoyable . She 'd stayed later than usual to check over a litter of puppies that were born today at their home  --  sweet , tiny Yorkies that their owner had brought in with the mama dog for reassurance that all was well . Melanie had sent them back home with smiles and instructions . <p> Only then had she been able to get to the paperwork . She had n't intended to remain this late . And now she had been interrupted . <p> She would n't convince herself that the sound had n't occurred , but she was unlikely to learn its source . Maybe it had been a car backfiring  --  did they still do that ? It was n't necessarily as menacing as she had first imagined . No need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some nervous newcomer , a city girl who imagined scary urban-type incidents here , in this pleasant country area . <p> Leaving the window , she grabbed her purse from a desk drawer and headed down the hall . <p> A soft light glowed in the infirmary . She stepped inside , and glanced from cage to cage to check on the occupants . The air smelled familiarly of antiseptic and the aroma of healing dogs . <p> " Hi , Rudy , " she crooned to the Jack Russell terrier she had been treating for a leg injury he 'd gotten on a mad dash through a neighbor 's yard . " Was that you I heard barking ? How are you feeling ? " The small , wiry terrier stood on three legs , holding his left front paw up piteously as he wriggled for attention . A soft , flexible recovery collar was fitted over his head to prevent him from chewing at his injury . Melanie opened the front of his cage and extracted the active pup , hugging him tightly as she checked to ensure his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothing words , she looked in on her other patients : a shepherd mix named Wrangler who 'd had surgery for a hernia , a Great Dane named Diva from whom Melanie had extracted two tumors that fortunately looked benign  --  although a lab report would confirm it  --  and Sherman , a medium-sized dog of unknown heritage who was being boarded for a few days while his owners were out of town . She spoke cheerfully to each and gave them pats and hugs , not wanting anyone to feel slighted . <p> " Time for me to go home , " she finally said , hanging her lab jacket on a hook near the door . " See you all in the morning . " <p> She kept the light on low as she headed down the hall to the clinic 's entrance . The reception area 's mini-blinds were closed as usual at this late hour . She checked her purse to ensure she had the keys , then slowly opened the door . Not that she really expected to be shot at , but she still felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterinary clinic was at the end of Choptank Lane , the last of several streets perpendicular to Mary Glen Road , the town 's main thoroughfare . Melanie 's house was next door . The two buildings were the only ones on this block , although there were a couple of antique shops on the next one , closer to the town 's business district . Usually , the isolation was comforting to Melanie . <p> Not tonight . <p> She made sure the clinic 's door was locked behind her and stood listening for a moment . In the light from the moon and streetlamps , her gaze darted around the quiet dead-end street . <p> Darn , that noise had spooked her . <p> Assuring herself that everything seemed fine , she started down the sidewalk toward her house , her footsteps nearly silent in her athletic shoes . The spring air felt brisk on her face . <p> But was someone watching her ? No , that had to be her imagination , sparked by nervousness . Still , she picked up her pace . <p> And stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog 's whimper . <p> Nervous or not , she turned back , hunting for the sound 's source . An animal in trouble ? <p> She spotted a furry heap in the opposite gutter , in shadows , not far from where the next block began . She had n't noticed the animal at first while concentrating on the direction toward her home . <p> She hurried toward it as she heard the whimper again . She dropped on her knees beside the barely moving dog . <p> " What 's wrong , fella ? " she asked soothingly . The answer was obvious , thanks to the trail of dark , oozing liquid leading up to animal . Blood . As if he had dragged himself here and collapsed . <p> The dog lifted its head slightly . He lay on his side , panting . <p> " You poor thing . Hold on . " Despite the faintness of the light , she scanned the dog with professional eyes . <p> The loud noise Had someone shot this dog ? This grayish dog that dared to resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And damn the people who 'd come seeking creatures that did n't exist except in their own perverted imaginations . <p> Could she lift him ? She was strong , but this poor creature would be a deadweight . <p> " I 'll be right back , " she promised . She extracted keys from her purse as she ran back to the clinic . She fumbled as she opened the door , then sped down the hall to the storeroom where she kept large bags of food for pets with special needs . <p> She grabbed a metal cart used to transfer sacks from outside delivery points to the storage area and shoved it ahead of her . It rattled and creaked as she hurried back down the hall . The dogs in the infirmary renewed their clamorous barking . <p> Melanie hurried across the street and maneuvered the injured animal onto the cart 's large lower shelf . Speed was important , but she did n't want to hurt the poor thing any more than necessary . She carefully pushed the cart around her driveway , rather than over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the clinic . <p> She hustled the cart toward the operating room . <p> Once there , she had difficulty lifting the hurt dog onto the table but somehow managed it , even handling him gingerly , knowing that injured canines were apt to bite . She quickly sedated the creature , but not before it looked at her  --  trustingly , she thought  --  with unusual amber eyes . <p> " You 'll be okay , " she promised , hoping it was so . <p> Soon , the dog was asleep . He had no collar , no identification . No matter . She would help him , even if he had no owner to pay her fees . <p> Melanie wished this were daytime , when her technicians were available to help prepare the animal for surgery . But at this hour , in this emergency situation , she was on her own . <p> With an antiseptic wash , she cleansed the area where she thought the injury to be . Yes , there it was  --  just behind his left shoulder . She used an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin to reveal a hole . A bullet hole . And no exit wound . <p> Quickly , carefully , she performed the required surgery . Not that she had ever removed a bullet before . But she had operated extensively on injured animals . <p> When she was finished , she sutured the incision and maneuvered the dog onto the sterile bedding she had placed in a stand-alone wire crate with an open top , preparing to watch him until he awakened . <p> She shook her head . " Lunatic , " she said aloud accusingly , as if the guilty party could hear her . " Credulous , cruel fool . " <p> Mary Glen was full of tourists these days , those enamored with local legends . <p> Werewolf legends . <p> Using tweezers , Melanie held up the piece of metal she had removed from her patient . <p> She had no doubt what it was : a silver bullet . <p> He still watched from the woods , wishing he could draw closer , stare inside the lighted building . See what was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bad idea . <p> Had he acted in time ? He had done his best , under extreme circumstances . Was it good enough ? <p> This was a time he could do no more . And now he would have to wait . <p> Only in the morning would he learn if he had been successful . <p> If his friend would live . <p> Melanie stirred in her chair . <p> Chair ? She must have fallen asleep somehow in the operating room . Slept sitting up , in the vinyl-upholstered metal seat she had dragged in so she could rest while observing her patient . No wonder she felt so stiff . <p> She opened her eyes . They felt gritty until they landed on the crate on the floor between the operating table and her . And then they widened easily as she smiled . <p> The faint light of dawn , creeping in the window across the room , illuminated the dog she had treated last night . He was sitting up on the bleached , sterile towels she had put inside the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she operated on , she had attached a large post-surgical recovery collar around his neck , framing his face , so he could not chew on his sutures . If he left the wound alone , she would remove it . <p> He watched her with bright amber eyes . Intelligent eyes . He seemed to thank her . <p> She gave a quick shake of her head . No way was she going to buy into the absurd legends around here . The dog might be smart  --  heck , she 'd guess him to be a mix between a malamute and a German shepherd , both bright breeds . He was moderate sized . His multi-hued coat was mostly gray tipped in black , but was all white in some areas , others all black . He had a long , strong muzzle and erect ears . Did he resemble a wolf ? Sure . But he was n't one . <p> And even if he was a conglomeration of the smartest breeds of dogs , that did n't give him human intelligence  --  like a werewolf would supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to him . He immediately stood in the cage-like enclosure , his long , fluffy tail wagging . " How do you feel ? " She did n't expect an answer , but she knelt on the clean , sunshine-yellow linoleum floor and examined the bandaged area near his left shoulder . Good thing the gun used to shoot him apparently had n't been very powerful . Although he 'd lost a lot of blood , not much damage had been done . The bullet had barely nicked his scapula without ricocheting , then lodged there . <p> Not enough to kill a strong , healthy dog , thank heavens . Was even a minor wound with a silver bullet supposed to be enough to slaughter a werewolf ? <p> Maybe she 'd need to read up on the lore , to maximize her effectiveness as a vet around here . Only so she 'd be prepared for situations like this , of course . <p> In the meantime , she had to make a phone call . Probably should have made it last night . <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , giving her patient a gentle hug without putting pressure on his wound . " But I wish you were able to talk , or at least communicate your name and where you came from . You appear well taken care of  --  not starving , and though you look a little straggly now , I 'd guess someone brushes your coat pretty often . " <p> He made a small whining noise , as if trying to hold up his end of the conversation . Melanie grinned as she stood . " Even if I do n't believe in werewolves , I sure do a lot of anthropomorphizing . " The dog 's head was cocked as if he tried to understand her . " Anthropomorphizing ? That 's ascribing human characteristics to animals . Like now . Understand ? " The dog barked , and Melanie laughed . " Maybe you do understand . " She glanced at her watch . " Know what ? It 's nearly six-thirty . Some of my staff will arrive soon , which is a good thing . Patients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't slept much . But I 'll manage . Just need a cup of coffee to get me going . " <p> Her patient stood up and wriggled in the crate . <p> " You 're surely not suggesting you need coffee . Water , though  --  I 'll get you some . And you seem to be doing well enough to try a little food , too . I 'll have one of the techs bring you some as soon as they arrive  --  it 'll help them get some antibiotics and painkiller down you . They can take the collar off for a while and see if you lick . " <br> Continues ...
