Celestron 's NexStar 60 GT , 80 GT , and 114 GT telescopes offer go-to convenience at affordable prices . // I 'm a 19th-century astronomer stuck in a 21st-century world . While my peers venture out with CCD cameras affixed to computer-driven telescopes , I stargaze with no-frills , small-aperture scopes . But much as I hate to admit , I 'm finding that traditional technology largely fails small  --  scope users and discourages novices . Let 's face it : Many beginning observers want an easy way to view astronomical objects without learning the sky first . Enter Celestron International and its series of small-aperture scopes . Patterned after their bigger go-to brothers ( the NexStar 5 , 8 , and 11 ) , these NexStars employ a computerized hand control that allows users to select from a large list of sky objects and order the telescope to locate the target . I tested the NexStar 60 , 80 , and 114 GT . The NexStar 60 and 80 are refractors ( 2.4-inch f/11 and 3.1-inch f/5 , respectively ) . The NexStar 114 is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a built-in Barlow lens that increases the scope 's focal length ) .

These user-friendly telescopes may herald a surge in popularity for amateur astronomical observing . All photos:Astronomy : Jim Forbes // Each NexStar model is lightweight and extremely portable . All three require some assembly using a Phillips screwdriver . Instructions in the manual are generally clear ; expect each to take about half an hour to assemble . The mount - essentially the same on all three - is a vast improvement over what I 've encountered with earlier scopes in this size range . Steady and relatively free of vibration , the mount is stabilized by a triangular accessory tray . My only complaint is that the tray lacks slots for securing extra eyepieces . Optically , all three models performed well . The NexStar 60 did a fine job on the Orion Nebula , Crab Nebula ( a first for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturn , and the binary star Castor . The repertoire of the NexStar 114 was equally varied . This scope has a rather large secondary mirror , but the overall light grasp ( I was able to glimpse a magnitude 13.3 star ) is hardly impaired by the resulting obstruction . And true to its " rich-field " nature , the NexStar 80 GT was at its best with large objects like the Andromeda Galaxy and Pleiades . I encountered some ghost images when viewing Jupiter with low power , but alleviated the problem by boosting the magnification . The NexStar 60 comes with three modified achromat eyepieces - 20mm ( which provides 35x ) , 10mm ( 70x ) , and 4mm ( 175x ) . Both the NexStar 80 and 114 accommodate 25mm and 10mm super-modified achromat eyepieces . All eyepieces worked well , except for the 4mm MA ( too much magnification for the NexStar 60 the upper limit for such a telescope is more like 120x ) . These eyepieces have the standard 1.25 " diameter , not the 0.965 " typically found with low-quality , small-aperture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED StarPointer finder which is needed only during initial setup . Once alignment is complete , the hand control reminds you to turn it off . After using the StarPointer a few times , my prejudices against LED-type finders abated . Quick Tech Support Now for the go-to system : NexStars require 12 volts DC , supplied by a power pack that holds eight AA batteries . ( Celestron also offers adapters for powering the NexStar with a 120-volt AC outlet or a car battery ) . Use of the go-to feature mandates prior alignment and programming . Auto-alignment consists of pointing the scope toward the northern horizon , entering the date , time , and location , and then sighting the scope on two bright stars automatically selected by the system . Auto-alignment works best from an observing site offering an open , uncluttered horizon . If you move the NexStar for a different view , expect to repeat the alignment process . While testing the NexStars , I called Celestron 's tech support personnel several times . They responded quickly to my live or recorded queries . Initially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth . A Celestron representative discovered that the motor was n't working properly . A replacement NexStar 60 GT sent out to me worked perfectly . The NexStar 80 worked nicely at first , but after a half hour , the LCD readout faded and I reluctantly suspended the session . A Celestron tech support person confirmed my suspicion that subfreezing temperatures adversely affect LCD technology . I warmed the remote by placing it in my coat pocket . A word of caution when using either the NexStar 60 or 80 GT : When these scopes slew to an object close to the zenith , the focuser at the base of the tube assembly bumps the mount . The scope freezes in place as the motor continues slewing . I also found that the NexStar 114 GT 's power cord often slipped out of its sleeve , causing me to repeat the alignment . Get Ready and Go-To When the NexStar scopes worked ( which they all ultimately did ) , they worked marvelously well . It was a novelty to simply press a button and watch the telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M31 " on the hand control , then watch as the Andromeda Galaxy glides into the field of view ! I enjoyed viewing the Orion Nebula without having to constantly recenter it . The NexStars ' tracking rates were n't perfect , but the scopes held onto a sky object for many minutes before recentering . Photograph Thanks to its 3.1-inch diameter , the NexStar 80 GT provides users with a wide field of view great for observing large deep-sky objects .

A beginner might wonder why he or she sees only black space after logging in Pluto , the Horsehead Nebula , or Stephan 's Quintet . However , I was pleased to discover the often-overlooked h3945 - a magnificent gold and blue stellar pair in Canis Major - as a double star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of NGC objects and add more double stars , as these cosmic gems are a delightful sight in small scopes . Veteran observers often grumble that go-to systems allow beginners to avoid learning the night sky . Realistically , many people do n't have time for astronomical ground school . In fact , go-to technology may provide the spark that attracts more numbers to our amateur observing ranks . For instance , in the past when I 've taught a unit on telescopes and astronomy to seventh graders , my students greeted the traditional alt-az mounted scopes with mild interest . That changed this year , as I demonstrated a NexStar 60 GT . When I pressed the button on the remote , the telescope began to move with its characteristic whirring sound , and the students let out a collective " Whoa ! " I believe a NexStar 60 , 80 , or 114 GT is a great telescope for someone as young as 12 or 13 - provided he or she has a sincere interest in astronomy and is at least somewhat technically inclined .

Photograph The NexStar 60 GT ( above and right ) is an affordable beginners ' scope that comes with eyepieces that yield 30x , 70x , and 175x. // While anyone used to computers will immediately " get " this system , an adult novice with little or no computer savvy may stumble a bit . I loaned the NexStar 60 GT to a fellow teacher . It took her about an hour to assemble the scope , and after a thorough reading of the manual , she had a great time observing sky objects that had eluded her in the past . Customer satisfaction is a good indicator of a telescope 's success . Local retailers reported brisk sales of the NexStar 60 , 80 , and 114 GTs as well as their cousins in the ST series ( same telescopes , no electronics ) . No NexStar models had been returned . How durable are these NexStar models ? These scopes and mounts should last for decades . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Electronics are sensitive and carry a certain risk of failure over time . I think the NexStars are worth the risk . Celestron offers a oneyear warranty on its telescopes . So , did the NexStar scopes turn me into a " technocrat ? " Not completely . Next time I travel , I 'll still pack my trusty old Astroscan in the car . But chances are you just might see a NexStar GT sitting next to it .
