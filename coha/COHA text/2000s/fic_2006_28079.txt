Chapter One MY NAME IS NICK PELLISANTE , and this is where it started for me , one summer out on Long Island at " the wedding of weddings . " I was watching the bride celebrating at the head of the dance line as it festively wound through the tables . A conga line . I groaned . I hated conga lines . I should mention that I was watching the scene through high-powered binoculars . I followed as the bride slung her ample , lace-covered rear end in every direction , toppling a glass of red wine , trying to coax some bowling ball of a relative who was scarfing down a plate of stuffed clams up into the procession . Meanwhile , the grinning , affable groom did his Gowanus Expressway best just to hang on . Lucky couple , I thought , wincing , thinking ten years down the line . Lucky me , to get to watch . All part of the job . As special agent in charge of section C-10 , the FBI 's Organized Crime Unit in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the posh South Fork Club in Montauk . Everybody who was anybody was here , assuming you were into wiseguys . Everybody except for the one man I was really looking for . The Boss . The Capo di tutti capi . Dominic Cavello . They called him the Electrician because he had started in that trade , pulling off construction scamsin New Jersey . The guy was bad , terror-level-red bad . And I had a slew of warrants on him , for murder , extortion , union tampering , and conspiracy to finance narcotics . Some of my buddies at the Bureau said Cavello was already in Sicily , laughing at us . Another rumor had him in the Dominican Republic at a resort he owned . Others had him in Costa Rica , in the UAE , even in Moscow . But I had a hunch that he was here , somewhere in this noisy crowd on the South Fork Club 's beautiful back deck . His ego was too large . I 'd been tracking him for three years , and I expect he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to make Dominic Cavello miss his closest niece 's wedding . " Cannoli One , this is Cannoli Two , " a voice deadpanned in my earpiece . It was Special Agent Manny Oliva , whom I 'd stationed down on the dunes with Ed Sinclair . Manny grew up in the projects of Newark , then got himself a law degree at Rutgers . He 'd been assigned to my C-10 unit straight out of Quantico . " Anything on the radar , Nick ? Nothing but sand and seagulls here . " " Yeah , " I said , dishing it back , " ziti mostly . A little lasagna with hot sausages , some stuffed shrimp and parmigiana . " " Stop ! You 're making me hungry down here , Nicky Smiles . " Nicky Smiles . That 's what the guys I was close to in the unit called me . Maybe because I was blessed with a pretty nice grin . More likely it was because I 'd grown up with a bunch of these wiseguys in Bay Ridge , and my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about La Cosa Nostra than just about anyone else in the Bureau , and I was offended by what this scum had done to the reputations of all Italian Americans : my own family , friends of mine who could n't have been more law-abiding , and , of course , myself . So where the hell are you , you sly sonovabitch ? You 're here , are n't you , Cavello ? I swept the binoculars along the dance line . The procession had snaked all the way around the deck by now , past all the juiced-up goombahs in tuxedos with purple shirts and their high-hairdo wives busting through their gowns . The bride sidled up to a table of old-timers , padrones in bolo ties sipping espresso , trading old tales . One or two of the faces looked familiar . That 's when the bride made her mistake . She singled out one of the old men , leaned down , and kissed him on the cheek . The balding man was in a wheelchair , hands on his lap . He looked feeble and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , maybe a stroke . He had on thick black-rimmed glasses , no eyebrows , like Uncle Junior on The Sopranos . I stood up and focused the lens on him . I watched her take him by the hands and try to get him up . The guy looked like he could n't pee upright , and he could barely wrap his arms around her , never mind get up and dance . Then my heart slammed to a stop . You arrogant sonovabitch ! You came ! " Tom , Robin , that old geezer with the black glasses . The bride just gave him a kiss . " " Yeah , " Tom Roach came back . He was inside a van in the parking lot watching pictures sent from cameras planted in the club . " I got him . What 's the problem ? " I took a step closer , zooming in with the lens . " No problem . That 's Dominic Cavello ! " ( Continues ... )               @ @ @ @ @ @
