In the wild-card era the baseball world can be turned upside down almost as fast as the bottle of champagne that lefthander Kenny Rogers emptied onto the behatted head of a uniformed Detroit police officer in plain view of a delirious Comerica Park crowd last Saturday night . It would have been preposterous to imagine such a tableau only a year ago , when the Tigers lost 91 games in a 12th straight losing season and Rogers , then a scofflaw Texas Ranger , was arrested on a misdemeanor assault charge for shoving a television cameraman . But now here they were , Rogers and the Tigers , wildly celebrating a dismantling of the New York Yankees in a American League Division Series that served as their get-out-of-jail-free card . Go ahead and try to make sense of this turn of fortune . You 'd have had better luck trying to hit the 103-mph heat of bloody-eyed Detroit reliever Joel Zumaya under the cover of late-afternoon shadows . No team ever entered the postseason playing worse baseball than the Tigers , whose 19 -- 31 stagger to the finish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status on the final day of the season . And against the modern-day Murderers ' Row lineup of New York , the team that had the greatest run differential in the majors in 2006 and tied for the most wins , Detroit brought a pitching staff with zero combined career postseason wins . // But if you 've been paying attention to playoff baseball , especially since the labor agreement of 2002 created a luxury tax and increased revenue sharing , you 've come to understand these postseason truisms : 1 ) the randomness of a short series mocks the established order of the regular season ; 2 ) a pitcher 's power is more important than his experience ; and 3 ) the Yankees , losers of 10 of their last 13 postseason games , have become the game 's emperor with no clothes . // All those realities were reaffirmed in the ALDS , which is how we arrived at a League Championship Series between Detroit and Oakland -- two franchises that had not won a postseason series since 1984 and ' 90 , respectively . The A 's swept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnabout in that they did n't look nearly as crisp as they had in the regular season . They flopped on defense , produced only one hit in 19 at bats with runners in scoring position and never held a lead . " We picked a bad time to have some bad ball games , " Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said after the sweep was completed last Friday , summarizing the cruelty that a small sample of games can hold . // The unexpected has become the expected and the regular season increasingly less meaningful . Entering LCS play this week , wild-card teams had a much better record in postseason series ( 16 -- 6 ) since 2002 than did the teams with the best regular-season records in their leagues ( 10 -- 8 ) . And if the New York Mets get past the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS ( page 42 ) , it will mean that the maximum of 10 different teams will have made the World Series in five years -- an unprecedented churn rate among the 102 Series played . // Still , even Detroit manager Jim Leyland never anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he took the job last fall . " Well , I did n't think we would be here this year , " he said last Saturday night . " I thought that we would get better .... I thought that it would be a year or so before we got in a situation like this or would have a chance to . " // The Tigers ' profile is not unlike that of last year 's world champion White Sox : deep in young power pitchers with little to no postseason experience , a breakout rookie throwing gas out of the bullpen , a middling offense that relies on the home run and an intense manager who is the dominant personality of the club . The players so admire Leyland that they carried him off the field on their shoulders after the clincher , a rare spectacle in this sport . // Through the fourth inning of Game 2 , Detroit had lived down to what Leyland , this year 's less-hyper version of Chicago skipper Ozzie Guillen , correctly surmised to be the popular view of the ALDS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varsity . New York had rolled to an 8 -- 4 win in Game 1 and a 3 -- 1 lead two days later with veteran Mike Mussina on the mound . But from that point on , the Yankees did not score another run until they were all but dead in the series , down 8 -- 0 in the seventh inning of Game 4 . In those 20 definitive innings Detroit outscored New York 17 -- 0 and held the vaunted Yankees lineup to a .119 batting average . The Tigers did so with aggressive power pitching from starters Justin Verlander ( whose fastball topped out at 100 mph ) , an uncharacteristically amped Rogers ( hitting an uncharacteristic 94 on the radar gun ) and Jeremy Bonderman ( 96 ) . " We did n't do anything special , " says Bonderman . " We just did what we always do : Be aggressive , throw strikes . We 're going to do that against whoever we face . " // The new faces chiefly responsible for Detroit 's 24-game turnaround from last season are Leyland , who , after a six-year sabbatical from the dugout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41-year-old veteran of six clubs , who signed as a free agent ; Verlander , a 23-year-old rookie righthander who made only two major league starts in 2005 ; and Zumaya , a 21-year-old rookie righthander who , like Bobby Jenks did for the ' 05 White Sox , attacks hitters and life with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. // The Tigers drafted Zumaya in the 11th round in 2002 as a 17-year-old from Chula Vista , Calif. , outside San Diego . He was a construction worker 's kid who grew up playing baseball on shabby dirt fields across the border in Mexico and acting , by his own admission , like " a troublemaker " and " a punk . " " I did a few things I regret , " he says , though he declines to be more specific . " We were low-class , did n't have very much . My dad Joel Sr. gave me all my aggressiveness . He says , ' Do n't back down from anyone , go after people , just like I taught you , and you 'll be successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zumaya in the seventh inning , after the Tigers had scratched out a 4 -- 3 lead against Mussina . The Yankees never had a chance . Zumaya retired all five batters he faced in the late-afternoon shadows of Yankee Stadium -- including strikeouts of former MVP Jason Giambi and reigning MVP Alex Rodriguez , plus leading 2006 MVP candidate Derek Jeter . " Did you see any of those pitches ? " Rodriguez asked home plate umpire Laz Diaz after striking out . " Because I didn't. " // The Yankees appear headed for a turbulent off-season in which next to nothing can be ruled out , even the firing of manager Joe Torre and a trade of Rodriguez , though A-Rod has been firm in saying that he will not waive his no-trade clause . What Detroit exposed as New York 's most pressing need , however , is the infusion of young power arms . The losing starters in Games 2 , 3 and 4 -- Mussina , 37 ; Randy Johnson , 43 ; and Jaret Wright , 30 -- had only 10 strikeouts combined against a team that had whiffed more than every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity of his fastball and demeanor to Game 2 , New York had played 58 postseason games at Yankee Stadium under Torre and lost only one of them by one run ( Game 1 of the 2003 World Series ) while winning 13 by that margin . " I really wanted to pitch at Yankee Stadium , " said Zumaya after the 4 -- 3 win , nursing a Corona ( or " Mexican champagne " as he called it ) and a right eye reddened with blood from a broken vessel caused by a particularly violent sneeze . " I told Justin before the game , ' Get me a lead and I wo n't lose it for you . ' " // Rogers maintained Detroit 's momentum at home the next night , pitching what may have been the game of his life -- no easy feat for a guy with a 1994 perfect game to his credit . Winless against the Yankees for 13 years and winless in his nine career postseason appearances , Rogers pitched with unprecedented will , animation and velocity all the way into the eighth inning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's 335 postseason games . // All season the young Detroit starters have taken their cues from Rogers , who regularly counsels them in the clubhouse and on the bench . Verlander marvels at the veteran 's attention to detail , citing , for instance , a Rogers admonition to keep his eye on the catcher 's discarded mask on foul pop-ups . If the ball should take the catcher back in the direction of his mask , an alert pitcher will pick up the mask to avoid the possibility of the catcher 's tripping on it . // The difference between Rogers and the young pitchers he has mentored goes well beyond age . The rest of the Tigers ' postseason starters -- Verlander , a Detroit first round pick in 2004 ; Bonderman , an Oakland first-round pick in ' 01 ; and Nate Robertson , a Florida fifth-round pick in 1999 -- are classically groomed power arms . Two of them , Bonderman and Verlander , were in the majors by age 22. // Rogers , by contrast , did n't play baseball for his Plant City , Fla. , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as an outfielder . Impressed by his arm strength , Texas took him in the 39th round of the 1982 draft and converted him into a pitcher . Rogers , however , was so raw that the Rangers had to teach him how to pitch out of the stretch . He logged seven years in the minors and then four more as a reliever in the majors before he became a full-time starter at age 28 . Rarely cracking 90 mph with his fastball , Roger earned a reputation over the years as a craftsman who changed speeds and could throw a biting curveball in almost any count . In recent years , however , Rogers has shown improved velocity while enjoying some of his greatest success . He has won 49 games over the past three seasons -- the best three-year stretch of his career . // After Game 3 , in which he surprised the Yankees with his velocity and flummoxed them with dive-bombing curveballs , an emotional Rogers admitted he never wanted to win a game as badly as he did that one . His young students made sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that intensity , it was unbelievable , ' ' said Bonderman , who needed only 40 pitches , all but eight of them strikes , to set down the first 15 hitters on Saturday . " I just wanted to go out there and try as hard as I could to do the same . How can you not feed off of that ? " // Like Detroit , Oakland buzzed through its series thanks to young power pitching . Indeed , six of the top 19 AL strikeout pitchers under 30 are in the ALCS : Bonderman , Verlander and Robertson for Detroit , and Dan Haren , Barry Zito and Joe Blanton for Oakland -- and that does n't even include Rich Harden , the A 's nominal ace who missed much of the year with an elbow injury and is now the team 's fourth starter . // Oakland also boasts its own reformed and humbled veteran who assumed a leadership role . Like Rogers , A 's DH Frank Thomas , 38 , underwent a transformation with his new team . The White Sox happily shed the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny Williams insulting him as a poor clubhouse influence on his way out the door . Thomas , who sat out Chicago 's title run last season with a broken left ankle , limped around last year 's winter meetings in Dallas trolling for a job . One of his stops was to Oakland 's hotel suite , where he met with G.M. Billy Beane and his assistant , Dave Forst . " The first thing I noticed was that he was in better shape than he had been for years , " Beane says . " After listening to him , after he got up and left the room , Dave and I just looked at each other like , Wow . This guy has something to prove . You could see how determined he was . That 's what got the ball rolling . " // The Twins briefly showed interest in Thomas , but , he explains , " I wanted to get as far away from Chicago and the Midwest as I could . " He signed with the A 's for $500,000 guaranteed , with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could play 115 to 125 games , Beane says , " he 'd hit 25 home runs and drive in between 80 and 90 runs . " // Instead Thomas played 137 games , hit 39 home runs , drove in 114 runs and gave Oakland its first true middle-of-the-order slugger since Giambi left after the 2001 season . " He 's a different man from the guy I knew in Chicago , " says Oakland righty Esteban Loaiza , who pitched for the White Sox in ' 03 and ' 04 . " He 's having much more fun . And he 's a big influence on the young players , helping them all the time . He was n't like that in Chicago . " // Says first baseman Nick Swisher , " He 's been like a big brother to me . He 's taught me so much about the game this year . One man 's trash is another man 's treasure . " // In his first postseason at bat for Oakland , Thomas whacked a home run off lefthander Johan Santana , the Minnesota ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 . Oakland would never lose control of the series . ( Thomas ripped another homer in the ninth , becoming the oldest player to hit two homers in a postseason game . ) In Thomas 's final plate appearance in the series , the Twins intentionally walked him with two outs and nobody on base in the seventh inning of Game 3 . The walk sparked a four-run rally that put a 4 -- 2 game out of reach . // The Tigers and the A 's showed plenty of similarities after they were done playing , partying with an intensity that rivaled their power pitching and was over the top for a first-round victory . Zumaya , for instance , skipped the Mexican champagne and indulged in the real stuff , executing an on-field simultaneous double-fisted pour from above his head and down his throat while Detroit fans roared . The A 's drank nearly as much beer and champagne as they sprayed and poured down one another 's shirts and pants . The bacchanalia spoke to the teams ' youth but also to the players ' unfamiliarity with the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team elder , tried injecting a bit of sobriety into the proceedings . First he warned his teammates before they ran on the field after the last out , " Do n't get anybody hurt out there . " Then , when the party moved into the clubhouse , Thomas found a dry , calm spot near the doorway to the clubhouse and kept repeating , " This is only step two . " ( Ultimately he joined in the revelry and allowed himself to be doused by teammate Bobby Kielty. ) // Of course , for two teams that bring a sense of newness and exuberance to the ALCS , such a reminder carries more potential good news : the opportunity for another , even bigger party . // PLAYOFF SCOOP // Get complete coverage and analysis of each League Championship Series game , plus all the latest news and rumblings in Jon Heyman 's Daily Scoop at SI.com/baseball.
