Pastry chefs transport the gingerbread version of Biltmore House to the mansion . Gathering plants and greenery becomes a fun treasure hunt . // A magnificent Victorian picture-postcard come to life , Biltmore House opens its doors , and a gracious hostess beckons me in from the cold night air . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smell fresh greenery . Candles bathe the 1895 home of George and Edith Vanderbilt in a warm glow , and at a distance I see a tree so large and bright , I 've only imagined it in my dreams . " Welcome to Biltmore , " says the smiling hostess . I wondered what it takes to create this fairy-tale Christmas each year , so the kind staff invited me back for one heck of a sleigh ride to find out . Join us as we peek behind the velvet ropes to see what goes into the massive planning and execution of dressing up this Asheville , North Carolina , mansion for the holiday season . O Christmas Tree-Prologue The floral staff , headed by Cathy Barnhardt , begins the planning process in January . The search for the perfect tree for the Banquet Hall is no walk in the park . " The really big ones-more than 30 feet in height-are hard to find , " she says . " We always use a Fraser fir . They hold their needles . We have a Fraser finder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for our trees . " Another daunting task for the staff is to find two trees , because the first one is replaced in early December . " We start at 4 a.m. , " says Cathy . " We have the first one down and the second one decorated by that evening . " Deck the Halls Eleven floral staffers oversee two large warehouses that hold 500 boxes of ornaments , decorations , and other holiday items used each year at Biltmore Estate . But every year the employees search out more . In August the floral staff fans out along the property , seeking greenery and flowers that become garlands and arrangements for the upcoming holiday decorations-three months away . After the cutting is done , the flower ladies negotiate with one another for the five rooms each chooses to decorate for Christmas . " Then we go through the boxes of ornaments and pick out what we want for trees that will be in the rooms we decorate , " says Jennifer Small , a floral staffer . Santa Claus Is Coming to Town Activity picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate . A caravan of boxed decorations begins to make its way into the four-story manor . Poinsettias that came as rooted slips in July continue to grow in the Conservatory . More than 700 plants receive 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness , readying them for their coming-out party in November . Bernard Delille , the French wine master , begins overseeing the harvest of grapes that will become Biltmore 's Christmas wine . " We do a special bottle each year with a holiday label , " says Bernard . At $10.99 , it makes a wonderful gift . Ten people work in the winery , and seven more tend to the vineyard . Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire Biltmore Estate 's four restaurants serve fabulous food all year , but during the holidays , the chefs pull out the big pots and the Victorian-era recipes ; then they cook up treats fit for , well , a Vanderbilt . Pastry chefs Heather Gatesman and Heather Gonzalez work hard to put the finishing touches on the Biltmore gingerbread house , a small-scale version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the Deerpark Restaurant , " says Heather Gatesman . " Then we transport it to the Main Kitchen , where it 's on display through Christmas . " Formed over a wooden base , the gingerbread house features a rolled fondant roof . The quantities of the ingredients boggle the mind : 72 pounds of powdered sugar , 6 pounds of butter , 4 pounds of brown sugar , 6 pounds of molasses , 21 pounds of flour , and 1 pint of red food coloring . Meanwhile , right next door , the Stable Caf-located in what used to be the Vanderbilts ' horse stables-presides over dinners during Candlelight Christmas Evenings , which take place in November and December and bring in many guests . " We start planning menus during Candlelight the year before so we can see what works best , " says Stable Caf chef Don Spear of his seasonal offerings . " We found a chef 's journal for the house from Victorian times and have been using that as an outline . " Winter Wonderland October seems to be the month when Biltmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The season officially opens this year on November 6 , complete with luminarias , candlelight tours , and dinners , so the pace quickens on the property . Christmas decorations begin adorning Biltmore House in early October , and midmonth , the Stable Caf and courtyard start their metamorphoses . By late October , the floral staff members have created their magic with miles of garlands and ribbon . The big tree arrives in early November , and that means all hands on deck .

The day that Biltmore staffers wait for all year-the raising of the tree . And this Fraser fir is a beauty . The freshly cut giant lies out front , wrapped in vinyl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk the 35-foot-long bundle into the Banquet Hall . With military precision , the crew hoists the tree and marches it into the house , watching out for priceless furnishings and chandeliers . Walkietalkies crackle as the green-shirted staff members deliver their prize into the Banquet Hall . Wade Ledford , who has overseen tree-raisings for 29 years , shouts out orders , and ropes are attached . Fifteen staff members pull from the organ loft while 12 pull from the floor as the tree slowly rises to its full height . After a couple of collective gasps and a close call with a swaying chandelier , it 's up , and the onlookers break into applause . Proud of the work they do in placing and adorning the tree , the Engineering Services crew has its own special ornament for the arboreal behemoth . " We hang a burned-out lightbulb on it , " says Wade . " We began doing it as a joke . Because we are maintenance , it 's our ornament . Now people look for it . " Currently all eyes are on the gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crannies to decorate . Granite lions out front will sport bright red bows around their necks . Luminarias will line the long drive leading to the house . Hundreds of poinsettias will snake their way into the Winter Garden , where choirs will sing and entertain guests who tour this holiday masterpiece of a house . But right now , the massive tree is in place . A year 's worth of planning has paid off in a beautifully decorated Victorian showplace that thousands of guests will enjoy . Somewhere , the first Vanderbilts must be pleased at their legacy of hospitality at Biltmore . For more information on Biltmore Estate , call 1-800-543-2961 or visit www.biltmore.com .
