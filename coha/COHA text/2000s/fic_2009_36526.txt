The scream that pierced the dull yellow November sky was preternaturally high-pitched . Its sound carried effortlessly , echoing through a neighborhood of Queen Anne Victorians into the barren woods beyond , fading only as it descended toward the Hudson River . Those who heard the sound mistook it for that of an animal  --  perhaps the call of a screech owl , maybe the shrill cry of a loon . No one believed it to be human . <p> I did not hear it myself . I can only describe it as others did , after the fact . <p> But memory can be an odd thing . The report of that inhuman sound , relayed countless times , took root in my mind . It played upon my imagination , creating an impression so vivid it came to seem authentic . I know all too well that memory sometimes refuses to let die what we most want to forget . But now , I also know that memory can create something that never really existed . That is why this particular scream haunts me as surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hear it with my own ears . And I can not mistake its origin : I know it is Sarah Wingate 's dying cry , sounded just before her brutal murder . <p> News of her death came as the oversized grandfather clock in our office chimed five o'clock . My boss , Joe Healy , never one to stay a minute late , was putting on his coat , ready to leave for the day . <p> " You 'll lock up when you 're done ? " Joe tucked his scarf around his neck . <p> I was at my desk finishing the paperwork for an arrest I 'd made that morning . Thomas Jones had shown up for work at the Conduit and Cable factory with a hot temper and liquor in his belly , an unhappy combination that led him to sucker punch his foreman . <p> " Of course , " I said , turning over the final page in the file . " Only Tuesday and our third assault this week . " I blotted my pen before I signed and dated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will proclaim it an epidemic and we 'll have the women 's temperance union on our doorstep . Though I 'd say it was lucky the assailant in each case was drunk . Men who ca n't see straight rarely land a solid punch . " <p> We were interrupted by the sound of footsteps clattering up the short flight of stairs that led to our office at 27 Main Street . I stiffened with a flash of foreboding , for no one ever rushed toward our headquarters . After all , the sort of serious crime that might lead anyone to need a police officer in a hurry tended to circumvent the sleepy village of Dobson , New York , at the turn of the century . <p> Charlie Muncie , the young man who served as village secretary and had taken charge of the building 's sole telephone downstairs , brought a terse message from Dr. Cyrus Fields . He needed our immediate assistance at the Wingate home . <p> " Mrs. Wingate 's home on Summit Lane ? " Joe asked , frowning in puzzlement . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Joe was perplexed . The Wingate home was in the estate section of town , and Dr. Fields was not the preferred doctor of Dobson 's wealthier residents . One of several local physicians who served in rotation at the county morgue , he also treated the blue-collar factory workers in neighborhoods along the waterfront . He partnered closely with us on calls involving domestic disputes or drunken brawls since , if the altercation were in progress , we could intervene more effectively than the portly but diminutive doctor . The affluent classes of Dobson preferred Dr. Adam Whittier , who catered to their whims with absolute discretion . While rumor had it their homes were not immune to violent disputes , they tended to handle such matters behind a wall of secrecy . The police , certainly , were never involved . <p> " Did Cyrus say what 's happened ? " Joe asked . A stout man in his early sixties with bushy white hair and a normally pleasant , ruddy face , today he glared at the young man as though it were his fault Joe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been murder done . " Charlie whispered the words as though he were frightened to utter them . <p> In an instant , I recalled the reason why . His mother had worked for Mrs. Wingate as a house keeper for years . He would have practically grown up in the Wingate house hold . In fact , the one time I had met the elderly Mrs. Wingate , she had come by the village offices to vouch for Charlie 's character and recommend him for the secretarial job he now held . <p> " Who 's been murdered ? " Joe 's voice thundered more loudly than he must have intended . <p> " The doctor said it was a young lady . A visiting relative . But he gave no details . " Charlie 's face blanched . For a moment , I worried he might faint . <p> " He told you nothing more because your mother is fine . Not to worry . " I patted his shoulder and tried to smile reassuringly . I knew Charlie was eighteen already , but right now , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word to anyone , okay ? Not yet . " <p> He nodded in agreement as I grabbed my coat and worn leather satchel . Joe and I then sprinted to the corner of Main and Broadway , where we hailed one of the waiting calashes that hovered near the trolley stop . It was not far to the Wingate house . However , it was situated at the top of a steep hill  --  and we were in a hurry . <p> Once we were seated , I glanced over at Joe , the " chief " of our two-man force . Tight lines framed his mouth as he drew his oversized black wool coat closer to him in a futile attempt to ward off the icy gusts of wind from the Hudson River that buffeted the carriage . <p> " When did you last see a murder case in Dobson ? " I asked . My voice was quiet so the driver would not hear . <p> " Why ? You 're worried I 'm not up to it ? " He bristled and gave me a withering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five months ago had been the mayor 's doing , part of his plan to modernize Dobson 's police resources by adding a younger man with newer methods . I was thirty years old and a seasoned veteran of the New York City Police Department 's Bureau of Detectives , specifically the Seventh Precinct . But Joe had been Dobson 's sole police officer ever since the police department was first created . After twenty-seven years on his own , he did not welcome the addition of a new partner , believing I was the replacement who would force him into retirement . His dark suspicions often strained our relationship . <p> It was several minutes before he spoke again , and when he did , his answer was grudging . <p> " In the winter of ' 93 , a farmer was shot dead , " he said . " We never solved it . " He shrugged . " But we also had no more trouble of that sort . Always figured the culprit was someone from the man 's past with a personal score to settle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you 've seen your share of murder cases in the city . But maybe I should ask if you 're sure you 're up to it ? You look a bit out of sorts . " <p> I searched Joe 's expression , looking for some indication that he knew more of my recent past than I had thought . But there was no sign . His question had reflected his own concerns ; he had not expected it to hit a particular mark . <p> I swallowed hard before I said , " I 'm fine , " with more confidence than I actually felt . I had a weak stomach , especially for certain kinds of cases , and I feared this would prove to be one of them . <p> What Joe did not know was that I had come here this past May in search of a quieter existence with fewer reminders of Hannah , a victim of last year 's General Slocum steamship tragedy . I was not alone in my grief ; nearly every family in my Lower East Side neighborhood had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For almost a full year following Hannah 's death , she haunted me , particularly in cases where other young women met tragic , violent ends . I had planned to marry Hannah and build a life with her  --  but I had no desire to live with a ghost . That was why this job in Dobson , a small town seventeen miles north of the city , had seemed just the right opportunity : I could grieve quietly and rid myself of unwanted nightmares in a place where murders and violent deaths were not to be expected . <p> But still they came . . . and this one would test whether my rusty skills  --  and my weak stomach  --  were up to the task . <p> Behind us , the cragged cliffs of the Palisades loomed large over the Hudson River , colored in the faded oranges and yellows of late fall . The character of the neighborhood changed with each passing block ; " hill and mill " was how the local townspeople described the division between the row houses and apartment flats nearer the riverbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village 's rising landscape . Church 's Corner marked the dividing line , an intersection with three churches  --  all Catholic , each distinguished solely by ethnicity , with one church for the Italians , one for the Irish , and still another for the Polish . <p> As the hills became even steeper , the homes became noticeably more capacious and ornate , some characterized by elegant stonework , others by latticed wood trim and dentil molding . The Wingate house was one of the statelier of these homes , situated on a particularly large expanse of land . It was a magnificent stone Victorian with a pink and gray mansard roof and an angular wraparound porch . On past occasions when I had visited this neighborhood , I had admired its majestic lawn and gardens . Today , it scarcely resembled the place I remembered , for the scene surrounding the house was one of complete chaos . <p> Dr. Fields was certainly inside , for Henry , the son he was grooming to take over his practice , was keeping several agitated neighbors off the Wingate porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the lawn ; they protested their restraints with ear-piercing yaps . And Mrs. Wingate herself , now approaching eighty years old , was seated on a straight-backed wooden chair in their midst . She looked cold , despite the fact that someone had brought her a warm wrap to protect her from the evening 's increasing chill . She repeated a series of questions to no one in particular in an anxious , petulant voice . " Why ca n't I go inside my own home ? " " Wo n't anyone tell me what sort of accident there 's been ? " And most frequently of all , " Where 's Abby ? " <p> Joe and I rushed past all the confusion , hurrying toward the main porch and front door , where Henry acknowledged us with a brief , grave nod . Inside the entry hall , we found Dr. Fields organizing his equipment . Cyrus Fields was a short , middle-aged man who seemed to have boundless energy and a remarkable enthusiasm for each case he encountered . His wide face usually held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . But today he appeared unsettled . Heavy lines marked his forehead and his full head of salt-and-pepper hair was uncharacteristically mussed . <p> He looked up , and when he recognized us , his relief was palpable . <p> " Thank God you 're here , " he sputtered . " In all my years , I 've never seen anything quite like it . . . I just ca n't imagine why . . . or what kind of person . . . " And the normally garrulous doctor trailed off for lack of words . <p> " It 's all right , " I said calmly . " Why do n't you take us to her ? " <p> " Of course . Where are my gloves ? " He did n't mean ordinary winter gloves , but rather the cotton examination gloves he used for each new patient . They were behind him , on top of the black bag he had set on the floor . " Oh , yes , here they are . Come then . We 're headed upstairs . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase that rose in a half circle above the entry hall . <p> " Is anyone else in the house ? " I asked , adding , " We saw Mrs. Wingate outside . " <p> " Yes , and her maid should be with her , " he said . " Her niece , Miss Abigail , is resting in the library . I did n't want them to overhear us , or worse yet , disturb anything . No one has touched anything . I know that 's always your preference even with our , ah , less serious cases . " He fumbled before he found the words that would do . <p> We continued to climb . The stairs creaked under the weight of our steps , despite the plush carpet runner designed to cushion the wood . Upon reaching the first landing , I detected an unmistakable odor  --  the sickly-sweet smell of blood . I cleared my throat before commencing the next set of stairs . But death 's odor is a singular one that , once detected , manages to pervade all the senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my revulsion to it  --  grew more intense . I could taste it , feel it , almost see it by the time we reached the top . <p> I had to pause for a moment . I gripped the banister , fighting to suppress the wave of nausea that welled up , threatening to overwhelm me . <p> Dr. Fields pointed toward the bedroom immediately on our right , facing south toward the street . <p> We followed with hesitant , slow footsteps . <p> When he reached the door , he stepped aside , allowing me to enter first . <p> I took two steps inside before I halted  --  for there she was . <p> I stared woodenly , at once repulsed and transfixed by the scene of ghastly carnage before me . The victim lay propped against the bed , her body precisely positioned , hands folded together in a demure pose . Her head had been so badly battered that I no longer recognized the features of her face . Splattered on the blue toile wallpaper nearest the bedpost , intermingled with red blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swallowed hard , again fighting the sensation of nausea that threatened to resurface . <p> " What is her name ? " I asked . <p> " Sarah Wingate . She has been visiting since Friday , " the doctor said . His voice was even , but the beads of sweat on his forehead and the way he averted his eyes from the figure by the bed belied his apparent composure . <p> " And she is a relative of Mrs. Wingate 's ? " <p> " Yes . Her niece . " <p> To refocus my wits , I forced myself to survey the undisturbed portions of the room . It was apparent it had been decorated in a tasteful and pleasing style  --  a fine dark blue and red oriental carpet complemented a pale blue bedspread and curtains , and two delicate Chinese vases adorned matching mahogany tables at either side of the bed . It was an atmosphere that suggested wealth and privilege . Yet today , it was nearly impossible to see past this senseless display of violence . I drew closer to the swath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noted as I came close enough to touch one stain , which indicated her death had occurred within the last few hours . <p> I breathed deeply through my mouth , vowing not to be sick . Such a response to the sight and smell of blood was a liability in my profession , and I never failed to be frustrated with my body 's visceral response . The hollow pit in my stomach was a familiar physical reaction , though it had been nearly six months since I was last summoned to a murder scene . That was in May , just before I left the city . There , I 'd seen more than my share of the squalor and crime endemic to my native Lower East Side , not to mention the official indifference to it . Yet my stomach had never gotten used to it . Once again I forcibly willed my nausea to subside . <p> The doctor and Joe had already begun talking about the case . " When I arrived , her face was covered by that blue cloth , " Dr. Fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lay atop the bed . " I removed it so I could check her identity . " <p> " Is that cloth from her dress ? " Joe asked curiously , walking a wide perimeter around the body to get a better look . <p> It took a moment for the meaning of his question to register , but I soon understood . The killer had slashed the victim 's dress in haphazard strokes from the bodice down , and the bloodstained cloth was of the same material . <p> " How old was she ? " I asked . <p> Dr. Fields paused before offering his opinion . " I 'd say she was in her mid-twenties . And , judging from the bloodstains , her body temperature , and the fact that rigor mortis has not yet set in , I 'd guess she has not been dead long  --  two hours , maybe three at most . " He sighed and wiped his brow with a knotted handkerchief . " I 've lived in this town for thirty years . That I should live to witness something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Were the others home at the time ? Did anyone hear anything ? " I asked , drawing his attention back to details and descriptions . It was the doctor 's analytical skills that this victim required now , not his empathy . <p> " You 'll want to speak with Miss Abigail , Mrs. Wingate 's other niece . She 's the one who found her cousin 's body . " Dr. Fields mopped his brow . " She told her aunt to call me before she fainted . No one else is aware of the murder . We still have n't told them . At this point , it 's probably best if you do so . " His voice was soft as he added , " It has been quite an ordeal for Miss Abigail . I for one can understand how dif . cult it is to walk into this room unprepared . " <p> But of course no one could ever be prepared for violence such as this . As I tried to refocus on the important details of the crime scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat wound and multiple slashes on her upper arms , in addition to the battery done to her head . Yet there was not a single mark apparent on her hands or forearms . I knelt down next to her to check more closely . But no  --  there was nothing . Had she even tried to resist ? It would have been a natural instinct to raise her hands to protect her face from the crushing blows . And I did not think she had been restrained , for in that case , her wrists would show signs of bruising or chafing . <p> The only rational explanation  --  one the autopsy could confirm  --  was that she had been incapacitated first , perhaps by a blow to the head . In that case , my picture of her assailant changed entirely . What sort of person would beat and slash a woman who was certainly unconscious , possibly dead ? There was no fight in that ; only brutal savagery . Was her killer so filled with anger that he had lost all control ? Or had he been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visceral repulsion to it , I knew others experienced a strange attraction to it . They enjoyed its sight and smell , as may have been the case here , where Sarah 's cumulative injuries were more than was necessary to kill . <p> I got up and circled to her left , where I noticed something else so odd I could not believe it had escaped my attention earlier . Part of her hair had been cut and  --  had it been removed ? I searched the room quickly to ascertain it had not been placed elsewhere , but it was not to be found . I took out my notebook and made careful notes of what I observed : Sarah 's long blond hair had originally been pulled back in two neat braids ; however , the braid by her right ear had been cut off at the level of her earlobe . I examined the shaft of hair nearest the cut and observed that while the exterior of the braid was encrusted with blood , the inner part was clean , which suggested her hair had been removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were done to a corpse as a message or sign , but the missing braid defied explanation . <p> Fortunately I had remembered to grab the camera as we left . I breathed deeply and began to take slow , certain photos . What my mind could not grasp now , I would revisit later , when the black-and-white of the film had muted the red blood that covered the room and overwhelmed my senses . I only hoped the record would not be marred by the slight shaking of my hands . As always , that shaking was made worse by the aching pain in my right arm , which had intensified with the first cold chill of autumn . Its dull throbbing these past eighteen months was an ever-present reminder of Hannah 's death . Or perhaps more accurately , it was a reminder of the incompetent doctor who had botched my treatment after I was broadsided by falling timber from the collapsing deck of the Slocum . As if I needed anything more to remind me of that horrible day . <p> From every angle , and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . At my insistence , we had acquired a fine Kodak . Even though Joe had seen little practical justification in this expense , he had reluctantly allowed me to out . t the department with what I considered to be an essential tool for recording forensic evidence . While at the detective bureau in the city , I had become fascinated with the latest technology , especially cameras and basic fingerprinting equipment  --  though admittedly , the latter remained controversial and was not yet accepted by the courts . But earlier this year , London had sent two murderers to the gallows after gaining convictions based on fingerprint evidence alone . And our prison system in New York already used fingerprints to identify inmates . So I expected it would be only a matter of time before fingerprint evidence made its way into New York 's courtrooms . Perhaps it would even be evidence I had collected . <p> Joe remained skeptical that Dobson had any use for all this equipment , but after the mayor supported my request , Joe had acquiesced . No doubt he feared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the retirement he so dreaded . He waited patiently until I had finished photographing the crime scene ; then he and Dr. Fields examined the body while I began dusting for latent prints . <p> I took out my kit containing the two kinds of fine powder that would make invisible prints appear : black and gray . I used the gray powder on dark surfaces , and the black powder on light ones . Print after print appeared , most smudged and partial , but a few were complete , with each finger ridge delineated . I photographed them all , drawing as near as my lens would allow . I stayed clear of Dr. Fields , though I knew his initial exam would not take long . The bulk of his work would be done at the morgue . <p> " Will you be performing the autopsy ? " I asked . <p> " I expect to . While it 's not my turn in the rotation schedule , I suspect they will honor my request given the circumstances . " <p> To my relief , Joe announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wingate , who remained unaware of Sarah 's death . <p> " We 'd better call in help on this one , " he said , explaining he planned to call our neighboring police department in Yonkers for additional resources . <p> " Do you want to telephone Mayor Fuller , as well ? He will want to hear about this , " I said . <p> He scowled . " No . He 'd only bother us with useless questions that we 've got no answers for . " <p> I shrugged . " It 's your decision . " <p> But the repercussions would affect us both . The mayor and Joe intensely disliked one another , and I had come to understand why . When problems arose , Joe was practical in his approach to tackling them ; he had little patience for the mayor 's preoccupation with political expediency . For his part , the mayor had long ago lost patience for what he viewed as Joe 's frequent insubordination . <p> We discussed how the Wingates might retrieve some personal items from the house for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them walking past this bedroom  --  certainly not until we had finished a thorough examination , and the more gruesome signs of death had been scrubbed away . Joe pointed to the area at the opposite end of the hall by the guest bath . " There 's a back stairwell off the kitchen that takes them up over there , " he said . " I expect the family uses it more regularly anyway , since it links these bedrooms with the kitchen . " <p> " Good . Then let 's cordon off this room and the front stairway ; we can examine it again tomorrow , in first morning 's light . " <p> We were lucky to have light at all this evening . The Wingates had been among the first families in the area to install electric lighting in their home , but each individual light was placed so sporadically as to offer little real advantage over the ever-growing darkness . Still , I continued my work until well past seven o'clock . <p> After the county coroner 's wagon arrived , and Dr. Fields removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in haste , for the blood splatters on the walls and bed were almost as unsettling as her corpse itself . Her possessions were spare , typical of a visiting guest . Opening the small wardrobe , I discovered three shirtwaists , each plain with large cuffs . They were next to two dark-colored skirts and a pair of boots that buttoned up the side . There was a modern Hammond typewriter at the desk , next to which was a notebook . On its cover , Sarah Wingate had written her name , as well as a title  --  THE RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS . Inside , line after line was filled with mathematical symbols and equations that resembled mere gibberish . <p> At the nightstand by the bed , there were two books : The Ambassadors and Dracula . At the bottom of the stack was last month 's serialized installment of Edith Wharton 's The House of Mirth as well as the September issue of Harper 's . Sarah appeared to share popular literary tastes . Ten dollars was shoved into the back of a drawer , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I checked between the pages of each book , in each drawer , and even in the pockets of each piece of clothing hanging in the closet . But I found no letters , diary , or notes  --  in short , no personal item that connected Sarah with anyone , much less the person who had wanted to kill her . <p> I went on to explore the first floor of the house , checking whether anything appeared to be amiss . In the kitchen , I lingered a few moments ; amid the odors of mulled spices and baked fruit , I could almost forget the stench of death that seemed to cling so tenaciously to my skin and clothes . I was so preoccupied with my thoughts that I was startled to hear Joe 's voice calling me , insistent and loud . <p> " Ziele ! " His voice echoed through the back hallway . " We need you over here . You 've got to take a look at this . " <p> I followed the sound of his voice to a rear exit near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coroner 's wagon as it rumbled over the cobblestones of the Wingate drive , departing for the county morgue . Through the door , I saw a full moon gleaming in the stark November sky . A number of glowing lights bounced up and down in the yard ; they were lanterns carried by our neighboring police reinforcements , who had recently arrived and were searching the grounds outside the house . <p> Joe met my gaze , and I noticed how his lined features reflected the grim events we had endured this day . With a flash of foreboding , I had the unsettling sensation that we were being drawn into an even more complicated case than I 'd originally thought  --  one that would draw upon our every power of deduction to unravel . <p> Excerpted from IN THE SHADOW of GOTHAM by Stefanie Pintoff Copyright 2009 by Stefanie Pintoff Published in May 2009 by St. Martin
