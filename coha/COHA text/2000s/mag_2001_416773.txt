// Deep-sky observers are undoubtedly familiar with " aperture fever , " a contagious astronomical affliction that causes a compulsive desire to probe deeper and deeper into the universe . Symptoms include an overpowering need to own and use ever-larger telescopes in the quest for the ultimate observing experience . Decades ago , when deep-sky aficionados began turning their attention to closer objects , they found that the optics in larger-aperture scopes available at the time delivered inadequate views of planets , double stars , and the moon . No cure exists for aperture fever , but some of the first treatments evolved in the late 1960s when amateur astronomer John Dobson began experimenting with large , thin mirrors in San Francisco , California . His simple mount design helped quench aperture fever by making large telescopes affordable . ( For an in depth profile of John dobson , see page 68 . ) Forever named after its creator , a Dobsonian telescope incorporates the Newtonian reflector optical design while using gigantic mirrors on an easy to rotate mount . Think of Dobsonian telescopes - affectionately referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on steroids . They 're the big , friendly dogs of observing that greet their owners with a visual tongue wash . At first , most Dobs were homemade . But by the early 1980s , telescope companies realized that not all observers had the time or knowhow to build their own . Astronomers hungered for a store-bought Dob with sturdy construction and high-quality optics . The first commercial Dobs were made by Coulter Optical Company . About five years later , Obsession Telescopes introduced a low  --  riding , truss-tube model that included higher-quality optics . Today , Obsession Telescopes offers five Dobs outfitted with 15- to 30-inch apertures . Discovery Telescopes , Inc. , is another contender in the premium Dob market . It manufactures three f/5 Dobsonians with apertures of 12.5 inches , 15 inches , and 17.5 inches . While other companies also manufacture large Dobsonians , only two participated in this product review . I tested the Obsession 15-inch ( 04.5 ) and Discovery 's 12.5-inch Truss Design Reflector . Design Similarities Both companies ' designs feature a primary mirror residing in a box outfitted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach the low-set mirror box to the upper assembly . Standard equipment for the Obsession 15-inch includes a 2 " DX-3 Crayford focuser from Jim 's Mobile , Inc . ( JMI ) . The instrument I tested also included the following options : a JMI DX-1 focuser , a Telrad lx unity finder and a light shroud , as well as the ( standard ) wheelbarrow apparatus for moving the telescope around . I rate the shroud as the most valuable option . A light shroud is standard with the Discovery 12.5-inch Truss Telescope - as is the JMI DX-3 focuser , a carrying bag for the truss tubes , and 10mm and 25mm Plossl eyepieces . You 'll get to choose from either a Telrad finder or 7x50 finderscope . Although the wheelbarrow handles are sold separately , your back will thank you for splurging . Constructed of high-quality Apple-Ply plywood , famous for its strength , finish , and tiny end grain , both telescopes are esthetically pleasing . Their noteworthy woodworking is finished with a fine stain as well as a clear polyurethane coat . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature a white ring ( akin to those used to reinforce looseleaf paper ) at the exact centers of their primary mirrors . These " targets " make checking the alignment much easier and more precise . Obsession goes an extra measure by also marking the center of the secondary mirror with a small dot - which proves very useful , since a misaligned diagonal mirror diminishes the quality of the views . Although these telescopes look very similar at first , their designs differ somewhat . For instance , the side bearings on the Obsession are larger ( and , therefore , a bit more stable ) and made from cast metal ; Discovery 's side bearings are wooden . The bearing surfaces on both models mate Teflon pads with Ebony Star Formica-brand countertop material , which creates a smooth motion when swinging the telescope in altitude or azimuth . Simple Assembly Assembly is a simple matter with either telescope . Obsession 's eight truss tubes mount on the outside of the mirror box , while Discovery 's tubes mount inside the box . It 's a matter of user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box as small as possible , facilitating transport and storage . Exterior knobs also ease set-up and tear-down of the telescope . Photograph Obsession 's detachable wheelbarrow apparatus  --  a standard option  --  facilitates movement of the mirror box ( 66 lbs. ) as well as the fully-assembled , 102  --  pound scope . Cast metal semicircular side bearings lined with Teflon pads create a smooth motion in altitude and azimuth . // Likewise , Obsession 's upper truss tubes attach with cam-lock skewers , reminiscent of quick-release bicycle hubs . This part of assembly requires bare hands - even on cold nights . But because everything you need for assembly remains attached to the telescope , this " no-tool " design is an ingenious feature for absent-minded , remote-site observers . In fact , the only way to lose Obsession hardware is to lose the telescope . Unlike the Obsession 's captive hardware , the Discovery knobs are loose , but the truss tubes come in preassembled pairs - a unique foresight that saves time . The end brackets slip over threaded studs on both the mirror box and upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knobs in the cramped space near the mirror can be difficult - and nearly impossible while wearing gloves . Mirror Mounts I was especially impressed with the similar , hand-adjustable diagonal mirror mounts on these Dobs . Discovery and Obsession scopes allow users to adjust the diagonal mirror mounts with small , spring-loaded thumbscrews - no tools required . The long thumbscrews on the Obsession are very convenient , even for someone with large hands . Obsession 's design requires the owner to place the primary mirror in a sling-style mount . An open-mirror style , including the built-in 12-volt pancake fan , aids in quick thermal stabilization of the mirror . This mirror can be easily removed , if necessary . Silicone adhesive secures Discovery 's primary mirror in its cell . This type of adhesive sometimes makes removing the mirror ( for cleaning or recoating ) a major undertaking . But the open back of the cell allows effective air flow for optical cooling and stabilization . An optional 9-volt fan accelerates this process . Outstanding Optics While Discover and Obsession share mirror stabilization techniques , they differ as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made in the company 's own factory . Its primary and secondary mirrors deliver about 94 percent reflectivity , compared to the typical 89 percent found on standard aluminized mirror coatings . Aperture size determines the origin of Obsession 's Pyrex mirrors . Nova Optics , Torus , Galaxy , and Pegasus are among its vendors . All diagonal mirrors on Obsession scopes are coated with " Endurobright , " a non-aluminum dielectric coating , which the manufacturer claims has 99 percent reflectivity . Enhanced coatings for primary mirrors are available at extra cost . Performance Testing I could n't directly compare telescopes with different apertures , but I did draw some general conclusions . Obsession 's Nova optics are superb ; Discovery 's mirrors are equally impressive . The star test , an extremely sensitive check of optical acuity , compares a star image on one side of focus to the other . Both scopes tested very close to textbook perfect . The edge-on spindle galaxy , NGC 4565 ( in Coma Berenices ) clearly showed off its central bulge and distinctive , dark rift . I saw galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slightly smaller aperture revealed 14th-magnitude galaxies . And talk about colors ! Prepare to be dazzled . These Dobs excelled at showing the true colors of Jupiter and Saturn . Jupiter 's belts revealed some wonderfully fine structure . Cassini 's Division looked like a pencil-thin line drawn completely around Saturn 's rings . Neither Dob is perfect , however . Heavy eyepieces may cause balancing problems . Decisions , Decisions Whichever you choose , these Dobs fetch excellent celestial visions of distant galaxies or familiar planets . And if these Dobs had tails , they 'd wag em . So feed your aperture fever . Let your Dob out tonight . Photograph Discovery 's truss tubes come in pre-assembled pairs , a unique design that saves assembly time . Its 12.5-inch Pyrex mirror delivers brighter images thanks to about 94 percent reflectivity - much better than mirrors coated with standard aluminizing ( 89 percent ) . Solid side bearings guide the telescope through different viewing positions .

" Never ever make the mistake of looking down on us . We freed this country , " he points at us . " We freed you , and now you think we are stupid . " </P> My hand shoots up , and the chair , almost reluctantly , points at me . I know he does not like me , or should I say my liberated mouth , which is quite famous around the university . The remote control mic is passed over to me by an usher . </P> " Your worship , " I begin to a hushed room . Black and white heads are twisted back at me from the chairs , as I am standing at the back of the room , just by the door . " What pains me the most about war veterans is that they seem to think that , since they freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the war , owe them our lives . " The chair is scowling at me , and the white-haired Minister 's teeth are bared in a fixed smile . " They fail to grasp that , given the chance , if we had been old enough at that time also , we could have done what they did too , and just as good . " </P> The usher reaches for the mic , but I brush his hand away . I continue . " We ask them to also respect us , as we respect them , by not continuously reminding us of the war  --  that is history now . Instead , we should be looking forward , seeking ways we can unite the diverse peoples that make up this country , and , most importantly , how we are going to save the once bread basket of Africa from becoming the basket case it has been reduced to now because of political incompetence . " </P> The usher 's hand darts in from below and snatches the mic away . </P> I remember their colorful return from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that tender age where kids take delight in tailing amorous couples into the bushes behind the township for a free porno , or peep through chinks in curtains in lodgers ' bedroom windows at night . </P> I remember the women the most . Wend ! </P> A gramophone was set on a chair outside a house behind our line , belting intoxicating rumba , and these two women , in guerrilla camouflage , were , of all things , screwing the air in time to it , and all so beautifully done ! </P> That dance , called skokocba , and imported from foreign Freedom Fighter camps , was pregnant with meaning . It promised the birth of new and exciting things tor the country . It augured riches tor us poor township dwellers who lived in crowded houses with no electricity , shared communal water taps and crapped in smelly pit-latrines where , it one dared peeped down the pit , you could see the tat maggots wriggling in the shit . </P> But seen from this lofty thirty four that I possess today , it also promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this with one hand , whilst they did that with the other  --  just like shameless itinerant magicians . </P> Lite was one hell of a big adventure then . Toyi toying under the silver stars at night around the townships with the victorious guerrillas , openly insulting whites with no threat of youth militia bombing the shit out of us , no riot police tear gassing us , no cell doors clanging shut on us , no secret police tailing us  --  even no censorship . We were one big jubilant family , so it appeared to me . </P> Amidst all this euphoria , tor the first time , the store was robbed . </P> I was skipping along the street that autumn afternoon , feeling halt guilty and halt happy with myself . I had just nicked a lickev from home , ami 1 was going to buy a sherbet from the store . It mama discovered the theft , well , there were three of US boys at home to suffer tor it , even it the others were not going to see the sherbet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my punishment was not going to be as severe as with the others  --  sometimes I had also been beaten by mama for pennies I had not stolen ; so what the hell ! </P> Half way to the shops , a man flew from around a corner , running hard and carrying a briefcase . It was the storekeeper ! Two men in rice camouflage were chasing after him , one wielding a hammer , and the other , a long bladed knife . Strangely , as is the habit of the township , no cheering onlookers followed tins chase . I had watched them disappear around another corner . </P> That evening , I heard father telling mother when he tottered in from the beer garden that the store had been robbed by " them . " </P> Other robberies followed , and the guerrillas assumed another exciting aura for me . At that time I was reading Robin 1 food , and I liked to liken them to him . Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor . For had n't they taken the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? I also visualized them taking from the storekeeper and giving to us , tor then , being rich was being a storekeeper , and the storekeeper never gave anything away for tree . Instead , he sold , and those without money weni hungry . Being a teacher was regarded as rich too then , not this farce of today where grossly underpaid and nearly destitute teachers borrow moncv from their students to try to make ends meet . </P> I loved to listen to mother and lather talking in bed after the candle had been blown out at night . It was fluent talk that solidified the world and lite for me , and often transported me to far-awa ) lands , to magical places in the rural areas where they had grown up and met . They made revelations to me about who were witches amongst our relatives and neighbors . The ) also talked about politics , and I now doubt it they understood it , no matter how eloquently they seemed to express their opinions , for they were both illiterate . And come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their bed , I never heard them fornicating , not even once . 1 remember one day asking mother where she had got a baby she came back carrying after a tew days absence from home  --  she had said she had bought it at the store . </P> Then Takemore , a neighbor 's son , came back from the war after a four-year absence . He became an instant hero to us kids . </P> In the evenings alter supper , we would sit in a ditch on one side of the street , and he would till us with awe inspiring stories about his bundu days that made me rue why I had not been born earlier so as to also have crossed to the guerrilla camps . One such story was how one day he had been hiding in a cave from white soldiers that had been chasing his platoon , and a big snake had slithered over him , and he had lain still until it had gone away . </P> " I spat at it and it died , " he had told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it go , it would have gi en away our position on the skin 01 the earth . " </P> Takemore never associated with any adults , although he was adult himself and had a heard and pubic hair . I saw it through the legs of his shorts one day when he had been squatting on the ground as he made a wheel for my toy wire car , because he wore no panties  --  and he had such big halls ! Always he was surrounded by us . I He taught us press-ups , which he said he had learnt overseas . There was one press-up which we could not perform , the two-finger one . </P> " Even your fathers and mothers ca n't do this one , " he used to boast . " Only a person who has flown in a Russian plane and slept with a white prostitute can . " </P> He also taught us how to draw an AK-47 rifle in the dust , . nd then to make a wire model of it . There was one gun he talked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky if correctly aimed . He said it was so big that it needed four men to carry it  --  but he could carry it alone- and when it shot  --  Heyi wena ! Basop ! </P> " If you want to bring down the sky , shoot the sun , " he told us . " But nobody can hit it , it 's so difficult because it is tar away , even ntikoloshis fail to reach it . " </P> Then one day he told us he would be leaving the township very soon . </P> " I was promised a house in the suburbs by the Commander whilst I was in the bundu , " he told us in the ditch . He had just smoked mbanje , something that I feared so much , even its smoke , because I had heard it said it could make one go crazy in the head and be taken to the asylum . " I he white owners will be moving away sunn . I also wanted the wife , but the commander said no. we must leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't do things that the rule book says no to , just like Idi . " </P> " Who is Idi ? " I had asked him . </P> " A black man who fucked Indian arses , " he had replied , stubbing the joint , then lighting a cigarette . " He drank human blood to get an erection for it . " There were eight of us kids in the intimacy of the ditch , all boys . Takemore hadl passed the cigarette to me . </P> " Smoke , " he had said . " let 's enjoy what the skin of the earth has to offer to comrades . " I was eight then , </P> I had taken a pull , and passed the cigarette on . Finally it had gone back to Takemore again , and he had laughed as eight kids coughed a lot around him . </P> Then Gasa , who lodged in the house behind ours , had walked past in the darkness . </P> " White boy ! " Takemore had called to him . Gasa had leapt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of houses from the sound of the battle to watch , and the ) eventually separated them . </P> I heard lather later saying to mother from bed as we slept : " The gorilla wanted to kill the Selous Scout . " That 's how father pronounced guerrilla . But still , this pronunciation added to the allure of the guerrillas in my eyes , for I could now see a romantic figure clad in camouflage and armed with an AK-47 leaping from tree to tree in the jungle , helicopters chasing above , and colonial soldiers below . </P> Whilst Takemore had disappeared before Independence , we had seen Gasa time and time again coming home dressed in regime army camouflage , and sometimes delivered in an army truck . 1 remember too one day , just before the ceasefire , when a haggard Gasa had appeared from the bushes behind the township carrying a rifle , which 1 was to learn later had been . n FN , and his uniform streaked with mud . He had stayed in his house without coming out tor two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out . tor he usually gave us delicious tinned food when he came from work , especially me as he sometimes sent me to call various girls around the township tor him whenever his wife was away in the reserves , </P> On the third night , he had come out , bought a mug of amasese from the beer garden and drank it with father in our house . Whilst lying under the bed with my brothers , where we liked to play when there were-visi tors , also with the hope of hearing something juicy , I heard Gasa telling father that he had been involed in a firefight with terrorists . </P> " Do n't tell me ! " Father had exclaimed . </P> " I am the only one who managed to escape , " Gasa had replied . " I ran through the bundu for three clays , and my first stop was here . " </P> The following day , he had gone away wearing his uniform , and carrying his rifle . </P> Then one sunset , just after Independence , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone , just took his chair and sat under the lemon tree , smoking cigarette after cigarette . We had steered clear from him , for we were well familiar with this mood . Even mother avoided him too . When darkness came , he was still sitting out there , and if one peeped out of the door , a tiny orange light could be seen under the lemon tree as he continued to smoke away what ever was bothering him . </P> Then later , sleeping , I had heard him tell mother , " My whites have gone . " </P> // " Hayi Ah ! " // " No more work for me . " </P> " Mayibabo ! Is this our dependence ? " That is how she pronounced Independence . " No more jobs for our husbands ? " </P> Up to that day , father had worked as a garden boy in a house in the suburbs , and he called his employers amakbiwa ami ( my whites ) . </P> I remember them letting father push their baby boy in a pram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember father scuttling on his hands and knees on the lawn of their front garden with this baby on his back , which was carrying a stick , now and then hitting father on the buttocks with it and crying  --  " Girrup ! " or something like that . This was such a happy picture for me </P> Back home , I had asked father if we could show mother the " Girrup ! " stunt he had performed with his employer 's baby , and I had received such a painful slap for my trouble . </P> Sometimes father brought us lovely toys from work . All of the toys were broken one way or the other , but as they say , half a loaf is better than nothing  --  kids came from far and wide in the township to play with the tows , elevating us to the status of celebrities . Then father started bringing us new ones . Beautiful little cars that you could wind up , place on the con-crete floor , and they would zoom away on their own . Battery-operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could transverse a miniature railway line , taking one on imaginary trips around the universe . </P> Then , one day , a man whom 1 recognized as working next door to father 's whites came running home , his face covered in sweat . In a breathless voice , he had talked to mother , and mother had hastily taken all the new toys to the house neighboring ours . The man had gone away . Barely a tew minutes later , a police Jeep had stopped in front of our house . Two black policemen , with father and the wife of his employer , Mrs. Almstead , had come out of the Jeep and entered the house . I had followed them in . One of the policemen was tall , and the other fat and short . The policemen had searched the room , and collected all the broken toys on the bed  --  we had no table . Then the tall policeman had said something to the Madame in English  --  she had shaken her head , negative , then she and the policemen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones are next door ! " I had cried out in Ndebele , wanting to assist , thinking they had come to admire the toys . </P> " Shut up ! " The fat policeman had snapped at me in the same language , but he had been smiling , and he had stroked my cheek . </P> The tall policeman had asked the fat policeman something in Shona , his eyes , looking sharp , fixed on me . I did not understand Shona . </P> The fat policeman had lifted me in his arms , smiled at the tall policeman , and replied to him in Shona . </P> Mother had taken me from the policeman 's hands and earned me outside , but not before I had noticed the murderous stare father had directed at me . </P> " If you sa anything to those policemen , I will beat you ! " she had said to me outside the house , in front of the lean-to where she cooked our meals . " You are lucky the tall one does not understand Ndebele ! " </P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . </P> Later , the group had emerged from the house , all smiling at each other , lather and Mrs. Almstead included , and they had all gone away . </P> " They personally told me they can not be ruled by a Kaffir , " I heard father saying from the bed , the darkness in the room solid and threatening to sit on me and squash me flat to the floor . I was quizzing myself how , for several times we had bought chips from cafes in town  --  how could cafes rule people ? </P> " They said that ? " Mother 's voice had been shocked . " Then let them go with their jobs ! We do n't need them that much ! " </P> As the country had celebrated its new-found independence , we celebrated our new-found poverty . A now unemployed father became the township drunk , whilst mother , brave woman , went to the recently introduced adult literacy evening schools , and , during the day sold vegetables at a street corner . Later , after passing her Grade Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , thus enabling her to pay our school fees . A year later , one excessively raining day , father was picked up drowned in a flooded ditch , an empty bottle of Smirnoff and a dead rat in his jacket pocket  --  so I heard it whispered fearfully at the funeral wake . People believed that he had been bewitched . It was about at that time that Takemore disappeared from the township too  --  for his new house in the suburbs , so I had assumed . And , oh , how I had envied him . </P> I am a lecturer at the university now because of the hard work of my late mother . </P> The well-rounded Minister does not even bother to stand up to reply . </P> " We have heard about you university people , " he says , assuming an expression that he thinks is dangerous . Maybe it was , once upon a time , when trees could do the bump jive and rocks could be pinched . " But just try it , we are waiting for you .

He has a matted beard , and an offensive smell wafts into the car from him . " Can you please spare some coins for the poor-drought wiped me out in the resettlements . " </P> I look at him , and gasp in surprise . </P> " Skin of the earth ! " I cry out as I recognize him . </P> Behind him , the sky is clad in blue skin tights that threaten to burst at the seams and reveal the king of bums . </P> Amasese : traditional beer ; Basop ! : Beware !
