Section : WOMEN AND THE LAW Despite increasing numbers of female lawyers , gender equality may not be guaranteed in the future . <p> The year 2001 is likely to go down as a benchmark year for the demographics of the legal profession in the United States . When the incoming class of first-year students arrives at law schools around the country this fall , at least half its members will be women , according to projections from the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar and other groups . <p> That is a first , and coming in the wake of other achievements by women in the profession , it might be tempting to conclude that things are now better for female lawyers than they ever have been . Moreover , it has been suggested that women are finally reaching the kind of critical mass that can foster greater changes for all lawyers . <p> But notes of caution also are being sounded that raise the question of whether women can achieve full equality in the profession through sheer numbers alone . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City-based organization that works to advance women in business and the professions , notes that women reached a measure of critical mass in the legal profession more than a decade ago . By 1985 , according to " Women in Law : Making the Case , " women made up 40 percent of the nation 's law student population . <p> But by 1999 , women made up only about 29 percent of the profession and , more tellingly , only 15.6 percent of partners at law firms and 13.7 percent of general counsel at Fortune 500 corporations . <p> " The problem is that the rate of increase in the percentage of female partners and equivalent senior positions has lagged behind the rate of increase in the percentage of women in the profession overall , " the report concludes . " The numbers indicate that women 's integration into the legal profession is not simply a pipeline issue . " <p> Deborah L. Rhode , chair of the ABA Commission on Women in the Profession , reaches similar conclusions in a report she prepared for the commission . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released earlier this year . <p> " Barriers persist , " states Rhode , a Stanford Law School professor , " and a central problem is the lack of recognition that there is a significant problem . <p> " Ironically enough , women 's increasing progress has created its own obstacles to change . In recent surveys by the American Bar Association and National Association for Law Placement , a majority of lawyers , both male and female , agreed that women are treated equally in the profession . Even those who acknowledge gender bias to be a problem often discount its significance or fail to recognize its persistence in their own workplaces . " Progress Becomes Personal <p> The challenge female lawyers face in trying to use their growing numbers to create a profession that is more fully integrated and responsive to both their work and personal concerns was illustrated at the Women 's Leadership Summit held in Boston earlier this year . <p> The conference , co-sponsored by the ABA women 's commission and the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government , counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government , academics , business and other fields . <p> But the overriding theme of the gathering was identifying how gender affects access to leadership and how continuing barriers to equality can be broken down . <p> The issues are put into personal terms by Boston Bar Association President Joan Lukey , one of the summit attendees . When her daughter , Heather Stevenson , was young , Lukey recalls , she worked a typical 10-hour day , coming home at 7 p.m. and spending the next few hours cooking , cleaning and caring for her child . Then at about 10 , after the little girl was tucked away in bed , Lukey would sit down to work some more . <p> Now that her daughter is 16 , Lukey , a senior partner at Hale and Dorr , says , " I would like her and her friends to have options I did n't have . I do n't want her to go through what I did . That 's the bottom line . I want it to be easier for her . " <p> In many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the worst of times . Women have made significant strides in the profession in both sheer numbers and real influence . No longer is it any more unusual for a woman to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court than it is for her to be managing partner of a large law firm or president of the ABA . <p> But barriers persist , say Rhode and others . Rhode 's report emphasizes that , despite female lawyers ' progress over the past 40 years , women continue to be paid and promoted less than equally qualified male counterparts . Today , the average female lawyer earns $20,000 a year less than the average male lawyer , Rhode states . While women now make up almost 30 percent of the profession , they account for only 15 percent of federal judges and law firm partners , 10 percent of law school deans and corporate general counsel ( even though nearly 40 percent of corporate counsel are women ) , and 5 percent of managing partners at large law firms . <p> Moreover , the impact of those barriers in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest Rhode and others . Implacable demands for more billable hours and the advent of the 24/7 work week have heightened work-life conflicts that heavily impact women . Moreover , in the environment of a tight labor market at large law firms where business is booming , the reward of skyrocketing salaries is accompanied by the burden of heavier workloads . <p> The barriers are perhaps most formidable for female lawyers of color . Putting the issue in practical terms , Angela F. Williams , an attorney at the Washington , D.C. , firm of Bryan Cave , says , " White men generally know a number of white women  --  their mothers , sisters or daughters . But they are not necessarily friends with or have had any in-depth relationships with women of color , or even men of color . " <p> The struggle to find common ground amid social unfamiliarity takes it toll , says Williams , a member of the ABA women 's commission . Fewer than half the female lawyers of color in the Catalyst study expressed satisfaction with their current employers , compared to 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study reported that female associates of color had the highest rates of attrition of any segment of lawyers . <p> If present trends continue , the conflicts between professional and personal priorities could be even worse for the young women entering law today than they were for Lukey 's generation . <p> Such conflicts are not exclusive to the legal profession , of course . But in the business world , the drive to squeeze ever-longer hours out of employees often has foundered on rising absenteeism , turnover and demoralization . In some cases , the corporate workplace is being transformed . For example , representatives of many major U.S. companies have been meeting every fall since 1997 at a work/family congress to discuss strategies for changing the workplace environment . <p> And by focusing on productivity rather than " face time "  --  the sheer number of hours worked  --  and by instituting measures to allow a diversity of approaches , such as part-time positions , flexible hours , telecommuting , and sometimes just better time management , companies have been able to boost employee satisfaction and commitment while protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize that , in a global economy , diversity is good for business as well as the conscience . Efforts are growing at companies to reflect the diversity of their customer bases in their work forces . Follow the Business Model <p> Law firms must begin to recognize and respond to the same factors that are getting the attention of the business community , says Anne Weisberg , project director for Catalyst 's study of women 's career experiences in the legal profession . " The business case has become so strong that law firm leaders can not afford not to be paying attention , " she says . <p> But , she says , " Law firms are relatively unsophisticated compared to corporate managers when it comes to human resource management , especially considering that human capital is their only resource . I think it may be because managing partners do n't have a background in management . " <p> Lukey says she believes law firms were starting to catch on to some of these human resources issues until circumstances conspired to intervene . A few years ago , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report " Facing the Grail : Confronting the Cost of Work-Family Imbalance , " she says , " There was an increasing recognition in the law profession of the importance of work-life balance . <p> " Leaders in both the private and public sectors were trying harder and harder to help their attorneys achieve that balance . " <p> But Lukey says attention to these issues was derailed amid a shortage of associates at large firms that helped send their salaries soaring in the past year or so . In a ripple effect , this led to in creased senior associate and partner salaries , which m turn triggered firms ' demands for more billable hours to cover the increases . Some of Boston 's prestigious law firms offer starting associates salaries of $145,000  --  numbers similar to those at large firms in other major cities . The trade-off is that the associates are expected to produce a minimum of 2,000 billable hours a year , which easily translates into work weeks of 60 to 80 hours or more . That does n't leave much room for worklife balance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is questionable , a glitch arising from the fact that in the traditional law firm structure , success is measured and compensated according to revenue generation , not net profit , according to the Boston bar report . <p> In other words , the project leader who works associates far into the night , racking up huge billable hours , is given credit for the revenue generated and compensated accordingly . The costs , in overhead , support staff overtime and attrition  --  as associates burn out and leave  --  are spread across the entire firm . <p> In this dynamic , efficiency and productivity take a backseat to face time . As the report points out , a partner who uses fewer associates and completes projects in minimal time is probably at a disadvantage compared to a partner who is inefficiently lavish in the use of associate time . <p> This system carries some hidden personnel issues . The demand for billable hours leads firms to hire far more associates than can feasibly be made partners , according to the Boston bar report . As the report points out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' billing rates and legal skills to catch up to their salaries , benefits and overhead , so the firm does not start to see a return on its investment until they have been there four or five years . <p> By that time , most of the associates originally hired have left . With a pyramid hiring scheme , in which most associates will never become partners , attrition becomes routine . The NALP study puts the associate attrition rate at 60 percent . For female lawyers and lawyers of color , attrition rates are even higher . The Work-Life Tightrope <p> But the concerns of women in the legal profession go deeper . Citing disparities between the numbers of men and women in various positions , Rhode states in " Unfinished Agenda " that " in accounting for these ... disparities , a wide array of research reveals common patterns . Women 's opportunities are limited by traditional gender stereotypes , by inadequate access to mentors and informal networks of support , by inflexible workplace structures , by sexual harassment , and by other forms of gender bias in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the profession , the most pervasive issue may be work-life balance . <p> Significant numbers of male and female lawyers responding to the Catalyst study cite work-life conflicts . But , the report states , " Women 's careers are impacted by this conflict in a way that men 's careers are not  --  yet . " The report says 34 percent of female lawyers have worked part time , compared to 9 percent of male lawyers ; and female lawyers are nearly four times more likely than men to have taken a leave of absence . <p> Moreover , 45 percent of the women in the Catalyst study said work-life balance was the primary reason they chose their current employer , while 34 percent of men said work-life balance was one of the top three reasons for their choice . <p> The Catalyst report states that " men and women respondents agree that flexible work arrangements adversely affect advancement , " adding that female law graduates , " whether by choice or necessity , make that trade-off , whereas men do not . " <p> Some say more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work-life equation as a matter of choice rather than necessity . If that is true , it raises the question of whether women 's advances in the legal profession will lose momentum even as their numbers increase . <p> At the leadership summit , Barbara Kellerman , executive director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , said , " There is a fair amount of evidence that younger women are no longer willing to make the trade-offs between work and family that women of the previous generation made . <p> " They want both , " she said . <p> That view is echoed by Naomi Klein , who finished her first year at Harvard Law School last spring . " The women who faced the overt discrimination paved the way , " she says . " But then the women who came after said , ' Thank you very much , that 's wonderful . But I do n't know if I want that path . ' " <p> Confronted with work weeks at some law firms that start at 80 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely to go into that  --  or if they do , they do not plan on staying at that capacity for their entire careers because of the idea that they want to have a family , they want to be around . " <p> That reluctance could reap unexpected rewards , though , because demographics affecting the profession may put a premium on all lawyers , at least for the next few years . <p> Reflecting the baby bust of the 1970s , there has been a steady decline since the early ' 90s in the number of people between 26 and 34  --  traditionally the ages of most associates  --  according to U.S. census data cited in the Catalyst report . Not until the year 2010 is this number expected to start rising again . This has been a key to the competition for talent in that age group among law firms , corporations and business , says Weisberg . <p> The decline in the number of potential associates provides a window of opportunity for women . " There is a war for talent raging at every level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To continue to be effective and grow in an increasingly tight labor market , legal employers must pay attention to recruiting , retaining and advancing women . " <p> But again , numbers alone are unlikely to swing the balance . Some say strategic coalition-building will be called for . And a key , they suggest , is that some of the changes that appeal to younger female lawyers would be welcome by other lawyers . <p> Incoming ABA President Robert E. Hirshon of Portland , Maine , for instance , plans to implement an initiative to study the continuing upward spiral in billable hours and develop possible alternatives . Hirshon is expected to formally announce the initiative , along with a related project to study the burden of law school debt on new lawyers , when he takes office in early August at the ABA Annual Meeting in Chicago . <p> The ABA , for its part , has engaged in other efforts to address some of the practical issues related to reaching gender equality , as well as racial and ethnic equality , in the profession . These issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports by Rhode and Catalyst both emphasize the importance of efforts in these areas . Call for Commitment <p> But both reports also emphasize the need for a commitment within the profession to address the continuing barriers to achieving equality within its ranks . <p> " The most important factor in ensuring equal opportunity for women in the legal profession is a commitment to that objective , a commitment which is reflected in institutional priorities , policies and reward structures , " states Rhode 's report . " Legal employers and bar associations must be prepared to translate principles into practice and to hold their leadership accountable for the results . Lawyers in positions of influence need to build a moral and a pragmatic case for diversity , to incorporate diversity goals into their organization 's plans , and to make progress toward those goals a factor in evaluating individuals and institutions . " <p> The women 's commission is planning a series of meetings with managers of large firms across the country to discuss how diversity makes good economic sense , adds Washington attorney Williams . <p> Some women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues have not united with them in seeking to achieve those goals . <p> Too often , white male colleagues see any measure that benefits women or minorities as coming at their expense , says Petty W. Tsay , a student at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who serves as the liaison from the ABA Law Student Division to the women 's commission . " They see it as a zero-sum game , winner take all , " she says . " If a woman or a minority holds a position , they think , ' That 's a position I 'm not going to get . ' " <p> But men as well as women can benefit from efforts to bring more work-life balance into the legal profession . Those changes are unlikely to come about without support from both men and women , she says . <p> Perhaps an even more important group than young male lawyers is their older male colleagues , primarily white , who still hold most of the reins of decision-making at law firms , corporations , courts and law schools . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set at the top , " Williams says . " And unless the top of a company or firm  --  leadership across the board  --  is invested in addressing diversity issues and puts its money where its mouth is , then the culture will not change . " <p> Despite the continuing barriers to women in the legal profession , there is optimism that their growing numbers will help provide the momentum for positive change . " These are demographic-driven forces , " says Weisberg of Catalyst . " They are n't going to go away .
