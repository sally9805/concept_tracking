Aboard the Jupiter , 2 February 1836 There was another storm this morning , leaving a foot of water in my cabin , and now a rat scrabbles amongst my sodden books . There is a stench of rotting hides . My own excrement floats back and forth . The journal I began when we sailed last October is ruined . I have started anewthis is my first entry . As sick as death , I 've eaten only oranges , and the teaspoonful of arrowroot I take each morning ( I just devoured the last five oranges in the world crouched against the bolted door of my cabin , terrified that someone would take them from me ) . We have not seen land , nor another vesselnot even a sea monsterin seventy-two days . There is no coffee , no biscuits , no marmalade , no ale . Henry is not sickhe eats whatever food remains and dines again with the sailors . They 've grown fond of him , I hear . Harriet is not sickto my astonishment , she 's never been better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry convinced the crew to tie Lafayette to the mast for his twenty-fifth birthday and douse him with sea-water . He spends much of his time with the ladies , particularly the lovely Miss Haywoodhe aims to improve her whist . Frolic , like Harriet , is having a lovely time . The dog has a little window of his own , tacked with netting , where he sits and utters odd moans of pleasure at the foam . Rather we were transported to Botany Bay in a ship full of Irish poachers than this ! At least we 'd have had the pleasure of a little felony . Aboard the Jupiter , 4 February 1836 I can not conceive what it is like for the passengers below , packed tightly with the captain 's private stores ofcheese and hats to sellthe hatches are closed to prevent flooding . The wailing of the eighty-four hounds belonging to a Welsh army captain is ceaseless . A company of soldierswho ate all the poultry before we 'd left the Thamesdrills up and down in new hobnailed boots , more thunderous even than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most grateful that the crew is barefoot . ) Harriet 's maid Jones is so unhinged that Dr. Drummond has tied her to a chair . Two sails were carried away in the storm and a drunken German piano tuner traveling to Ceylon lost overboard . Henry says it is a great pity , as piano tuners are hard to find in the East . There was a gathering on deck at sunset to ease his way to his Reward , but I could not bring myself to attend . My sheets are stiff with blood ; my hair heavy with salt . There are no clean clothes . My nightdress was so soiled , I stuffed it through the porthole and watched it disappear in the dirty yellow sky . Aboard the Jupiter , 5 February 1836 I sleep when my exhaustion is so great that even I can not resistthe click of the cockroaches can not keep me awake , nor the sailors singing " May God Sink the Sea , " nor the groan of the bulkheads as they strain to split in two . The ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my body . The movement of the ship both lulls and torments mea glide forward and then a trembling pause until the ship relinquishes with a shudder and swoons into the trough of the next swell . It puts me in mind of the plea- sures of love . St. Clry hides in his cabin with green-sickness , and Henry 's manservant , Crick , is covered in boils . Aboard the Jupiter , 8 February 1836 No matter how loud I scream , no one can hear me . Aboard the Jupiter , 12 February 1836 I am feeling better now . It is so hot now we 've passed the Equator , I wear only a muslin camisole under my dressing gown . ( By the time we reached Rio de Janeiro , I 'd given up wearing stockings or dressing my hair . ) My maid Brandt is disappointed that I refuse to unpack my finery , in fear that soon we will be obliged to dress like Ali Baba ( she has never forgotten the evening that my mother , who 'd been once to Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeweled dagger at her waist ) , but she is too busy quarreling with the new half-caste maid , Rosina , to make a fuss . Harriet , good girl that she is , happily keeps up her regime , wearing her corset without complaint , plaiting and plaiting again her hair into two splendid coils , splashing in the buckets of salt water the young officers conspire to bring herCapt . Chesnell is said to have challenged Lt. Galsworthy for twice going out of turn . She busies herself writing longish letters when she is not memorizing Lalla Rookh . I worry that my sister will have a difficult time of it when we arrive . Harriet is used to comfort and quiet and a certain kind of society . That she is a trifling bit simple will be an advantage , for once . I used to sit in my cabin and think of ways to frighten her ( it is not as easy as one would thinkshe is not embarrassed by fairies ) . I 'd set off to find her with something akin to glee , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prowled round her , robbed me of my purpose . She is so biddable , so eager to please that I would creep back to my cabin in shame . Life on board ship , while not being Paradise to all , as Brandt insists on reminding me , is nothing compared to what awaits us . Aboard the Jupiter , 18 February 1836 Yesterday , an unearthly howl , one I 've not heard before , racketed through the ship like a troupe of demons . ( At first , I thought that I was howling . ) I bestirred myself to the kennel where Lafayette keeps his dogs , but they were dumb with fear , cringing against each other . Eighteen puppies have been born in four months . I never liked a greyhoundtoo eagerbut these were pitiable in their distress . Even Capt . Llewellyn 's hounds were speechless for once . Tonight when I heard the horrible scream again , I slid from my berth , making my way as best I could across the fen that was once my mother 's carpet ( we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw open the door . There was no one there . I could not bear to return to my berthit reeks of too many other filthy soulsand found myself wondering if Henry were still awake . I went down the dark passage , my hands skimming the walls to keep from falling . Lafayette chipped one of his teeth in a fall last month . The door to Henry 's cabin was open . I stepped inside . He was sitting in an old armchair from Ravenhill , bent over a map . I made myself a place on a narrow bench built into the wall . There was a basket of mending on the bench , waiting for Crick to recover his senses , if not his skill with a darning egg . ( I used to slip into Henry 's room when he was away at school to look at his things . I used to take his stockings to bed . ) " You have worn your stockings to shreds , my dear , " I said , looking into the basket . The bench was seeping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " He made an attempt to move his chair closer to me , forgetting that it was nailed to the floor . I snipped a thread from my bodice with a pair of tiny gold scissors from the sewing basket . " Shall we resume Mr. Berwick 's Life ? " I asked . I glanced at him , wondering if his curious giddiness of the last few weeks had finally passed . He still resembles a convictthe bits of hair clipped from his poor head for souvenir locks have yet to grow back , rendering his pale eyes too large for his face . He put the map aside with reluctance . I lighted another lamp , and found the Berwick , its pages brittle , and opened it to my place . " I had long made up my mind , not to marry while my father and mother lived , in order that my undivided attention might be bestowed upon them . My mother , had indeed , sometime before recommended a young woman in the neighborhood to me as a wifeshe did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her deportment , beautiful and handsome in her person and had a good fortune . In compliance with this recommendation , I soon got acquainted and became intimate with her , but was careful not to proceed further , and soon discovered that ' tho her character was innocence itself she was mentally one of the weakest of her sex " He interrupted me . " Do you remember the time Aunt Sally caught her skirt climbing a stile and tumbled head over heels , landing on her feet with her dress over her head ? " He began to laugh , scratching his short gray beard . Crick has been too sick to shave him . " You always forget that I was n't there , " I said . " Harriet was there . " " And the next week Glamorgan had made a dozen tartan pantaloons for her to wear under her hoops . In Father 's books they never wore underlinen . Much nicer . " " For all the times you have told me this story , I wish I had been there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't catch my tease . I would n't say that Henry has wit , although he is superb with puns . " I could swear you were , " he said . " No . I 've certainly come to regret it . " " Yes . " " Have you concern of these things ? " He was puzzled for the briefest moment . " These things ? " " Women 's fashions . " " I leave that to my sisters . " He was looking at my feet . As it is always my delight to oblige him , I lifted my dressing gown so he could see my ankles . I was wearing a pair of red morocco slippers ; I was not wearing stockings . ( When we were young , he liked me tied to my spine board and trussed like a goose . ) " Shall I read on ? " He grunted . I pulled the lamp closer . " The smirking lasses had long thrown out their jibes against me as being a woman hater , but in this they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my conduct towards them , as I held it extremely wrong and cruel to sport with the feelings of any one of them in making them believe that I was in love with any of them , without really being so ; in this ( which was one of my resolves ) sincerity and truth are my guides . " I looked up and saw that he had gone back to his map . I laid aside the Berwick , of which I am not over-fond , and , rescuing Saint-Simon from the exile of my pocket , eagerly returned with him to Paris .
