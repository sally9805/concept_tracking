Section : testaments <p> You have to be quiet if you want to wake the baby Jesus in your life . In a noisy , busy world , the silence and solitude of contemplation are essential elements in our Advent search for the newborn kingdom . <p> NEW ENGLAND IS AN ONGOing show of seasonal delights , as everyone who lives there knows . Autumn is the premier season , drawing tourists for weekend-long drives through its painterly forests and hills . <p> Winter is a Currier &; Ives portrait of snow blanketing historic houses in church-centered towns . Springtime breathes warmth and greenery back into the postcard landscape , and summer is a romp on the beaches while a profusion of flowers bursts from every seaside garden and flowerpot . <p> During the year I lived in Massachusetts , I took every opportunity to be outside to experience the glories of weather . The perfect fall days were especially inviting , which inclined me , while strolling around town one afternoon , to take an unfamiliar street that eventually ran out of sidewalk and onto a rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties until there were no more of those , either . <p> Eventually the road led into the woods where I was immersed in a beauty so deep and complete it felt like the discovery of a secret realm . My heart expanded ; I kept walking for what seemed like hours . Only nightfall made me turn back . <p> When Advent arrived that year , I decided to observe the season by taking a daily walk along that hidden road as a form of contemplation . On the one hand , who could n't use the exercise ? On the other , I was searching for a prayer schedule I could stick to faithfully . <p> The hour just before dawn was appealing because what else is there to do at that time in the morning but pray ? And so each morning that Advent I walked an hour out and an hour back along that glorious route , experiencing many privileged dawns throughout the surrendering autumn and gradual descent of winter . <p> Before too long the snows came , and more layers of clothes were needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there every day in the flesh and wakening world was no longer an option : I could not fail to meet my pre-dawn community . <p> COMMUNITY ? IT WAS A GREAT SURPRISE TO ME , TOO , TO find companions on that daily walk . I did not learn their names ; we never spoke . But every morning before the sun made its way over the horizon , there they were , the middle-aged woman and her dog , walking silently down that same road from the opposite direction . We met , bowed our heads slightly in acknowledgment of the other , committed to the silence as part of a mutual discipline . Even the dog trotted respectfully at the woman 's side and did not raise a fuss when he caught sight of me , the squirrels , or the occasional deer . Human and beast alike respected the sanctity of the quiet . That was part of the reason we chose this hour to be out there . Without a word passing between us , the ritual code was understood . <p> And then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dark , his back bent and his hair quite white . His eyes twinkled with merriment as we passed each time , as if to share the joke : Would n't everybody like to know about this ? Is n't it great that they do n't ? Yet nothing was actually said in our ongoing communion of still ness . I wondered if the man encountered the woman with the dog earlier on his way , or perhaps some other person farther down the direction he was headed . <p> Some mornings , the woman was later than usual and I missed her within the range of our usual intersection , grateful when she finally came into view with her plaid coat , umbrella , and leashed companion . Other mornings , the old man might fail to appear at all , and I grew anxious for him , hopeful that he was all right . <p> When he returned to his routine a day or two later , relief flooded me and our nod of greeting held more than the usual share of welcome . We had such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a momentary intersection of our paths as reassuring as any evening of conversation with a friend . <p> And so we shared each morning in our monastery without walls , a community of strangers , serene in the silence and reveling in the beauty . When I think back on those Advent hours , I am most conscious of their ethereal quality , as if heaven were breaking into time and revealing what was , what is , and what is to come . <p> IN THE SEASON OF ADVENT , WHATEVER OUR CIRCUMSTANCES , we all have the opportunity to take a fragile and mystical journey from the darkness into the light of a new day . And we do n't have to stir a step outside our parlors to do it . The prophets of this season remind us of the astonishing revelations God holds out for our consideration . <p> First , Jeremiah brings a word from the Lord : The days are coming when God will fulfill the divine promise of justice in the arrival of the " just shoot . " In a contemplative hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like . As Pope Paul VI used to say , justice is the precursor of a peaceful world , so " if you want peace , work for justice . " How do our choices for justice contribute to peace in our families , our communities , our nation , and beyond ? <p> A recent T-shirt imitates the popular WWJD message with its blunt challenge : " Who would Jesus bomb ? " So long as we live with the conviction that violence is necessary and some killing is moral , we will always have violence and killing . Is this the world we want and the future we choose , or can the work of justice stem the tide of hatred gathering in every corner of the globe ? <p> The prophet Baruch speaks next , comforting us with the message that even in the most forsaken times , we may " stand upon the heights " and rejoice that we are " remembered by God . " In the hour of contemplation , we rest in that assurance and can commit our cares to God 's steadfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ailing child , a troubled adolescent , or an adult suffering from depression or discouragement ? We take this opportunity to surrender them into the hands of a gracious and merciful Lord . <p> Do we know of someone 's pain or poverty , an unaddressed addiction , or a final illness ? God knows of it , too , and there is no anguish so hidden that God is not present to it and participating in its answer . <p> In contemplation we stand upon the heights of faith , free from the doubts or fears that assail us in the present season of our lives . The prophets saw past the moment of exile to the certainty of God 's deliverance , and with eyes opened by means of the contemplative path we can see from that same inspired perspective . <p> " God will sing joyfully because of you , as one sings at festivals . " This is the word from Zephaniah , the prophet of Gaudete Sunday , which begins the third week of Advent . This is our " Rejoice " Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chosen to celebrate us . <p> Why on earth would God do that ? We know we are sinners , full of sad excuses for the moral shortcuts we take on a daily basis . We know the limitations of our love , and the excesses of our selfishness . How do we disappoint ourselves ? Let us count the ways : with our impatience and ready anger , through prejudice and catty remarks , by our absolute unwillingness to forgive , in our ugly indifference to the suffering of others . <p> And yet God sings for you and for me . It would be embarrassing if our shame were all we had to cling to . But we have more , as people of faith : We have the cross , that supreme emblem of compassionate love that testifies beyond all doubt that God 's love is real and unshakable . Only love remains in the room when we make a fool of ourselves and lose the esteem of the crowds . Only love holds onto us when we fall and fail . Only love is faithful when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are warmed and heartened by the reminder that God 's love will be there whenever we turn back for it . <p> MICAH SPEAKS LAST IN THIS SEASON OF ADVENT . HIS MESsage is about Bethlehem , the small and irrelevant birthplace of the world 's salvation . Even the foreign astrologers from the East knew that if you were looking for something or someone important , you start in prestigious cities like Jerusalem and head toward great palaces like King Herod 's . You do n't trawl around the countryside and poke your head in every last barn and cave . Yet greatness was not to be found with Herod or in Jerusalem . Awe was waiting in a humble town and residing among the poor . <p> We hear this message clearly presented in every corner of the gospel story . Can anything good come from Nazareth ? In fact , the source of goodness hails from there . Will the meek ever get a break ? Actually , one day they will inherit the earth . Should children be seen and not heard ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , and we should all strive to imitate them . If we seek understanding , all we have to do is invert our thinking . <p> What seems significant  --  the acquiring of wealth and power and admiration  --  is actually a waste of precious time . What seems useless  --  keeping company with the marginalized and investing our resources with the disadvantaged  --  is the most productive thing we can do from a God's-eye perspective . <p> The journey down the road of contemplation assists us in this inverted way of seeing the world and our role in it . And spending time in a contemplative mode is necessary if we are to apprehend the mystery awaiting us at the end of Advent , which is the ultimate inversion of reality : God becomes one of us . Eternity enters into time . Omnipresence takes up an inauspicious address , and omnipotence makes itself vulnerable , even to death . <p> There is no fast track to absorbing this watershed event of Christian history . The prophets spent years in the desert , a lifetime of stillness watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fields , before they spoke one word of the Lord . We have to learn to read the signs implicit in our world if we want to approach an understanding of the ways of God . <p> The Incarnation of God in Jesus is central to our faith , but we must sit in silence before this mystery . Otherwise , heaven will continue to break into time and escape our attention utterly .
