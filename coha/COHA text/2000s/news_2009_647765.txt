Even before they cast ballots on Wednesday , most South Africans feel certain that they know who will be their next president . Barring a dramatic reversal in the polls , the African National Congress will come out on top , with the ANC 's populist leader Jacob Zuma set to be the next president . <p> But far from discouraging voter turnout , the inevitability of Mr. Zuma 's presidency seems likely to drive a record turnout of voters , with an estimated 80 percent of 23 million registered voters expected to cast their votes . <p> Those who love Zuma see a warm , personable , and deeply rooted man who knows what it means to be poor . Those who hate him see a former ANC intelligence chief with a grade school education ; a polygamist who was accused and acquitted of rape ; a wheeler-dealer accused of bribe-taking , although corruption charges were eventually dropped . Whether to block him or support him , South Africans are expected to <p> show up in droves to vote . <p> " Despite the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is an important election , " says Steven Friedman , a political analyst at the Institute for Democracy in Southern Africa , a think tank in Tshwane , formerly known as Pretoria . This could be the highest voter turnout since the end of apartheid in 1994 , Mr. Friedman says , and a sign of whether the ANC 's hold on power - as the party of Nelson Mandela and liberation - is finally starting to slip . <p> The ANC now faces competition <p> The energy in this election has as much to do with Zuma as it does with the fact that the ANC finally has competition for the black majority vote , with the formation of a breakaway party known as the Congress of the People , or COPE . " We were getting to the stage , where everyone knew who was going to win , but COPE has shaken things up a bit , " says Friedman . " COPE 's formation energized politics , not only with their supporters , but they also energized the ANC . " <p> COPE formed in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside then-ANC president Thabo Mbeki , who eventually stepped down as the country 's president in September . <p> Unlike other opposition parties , COPE 's leaders have " liberation credentials " from having fought apartheid . Its founders are mainly functionaries loyal to Mr. Mbeki . <p> " COPE has galvanized youth in a way that has n't happened before , " says Adam Habib , a political analyst and vice chancellor of the University of Johannesburg . " I think the split in the ANC has energized the COPE and significantly galvanized members of ANC as well . Now anything can happen . Whether the ANC gets two-thirds of the vote or not , we shall see , but I think that question is of symbolic value for how to judge Jacob Zuma ' s victory . " <p> Despite high levels of discontent in the government - with crumbling infrastructure , overcrowded schools , high unemployment , and lack of drinking water and electricity in poor townships - the ANC 's lock on the electorate is so great that one opposition party has printed posters that read " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , despite South Africa 's aspirations of being a " rainbow nation " of racial harmony , South Africa 's vast majority of citizens are poor and black , and most people vote on issues of identity , black or white , rich or poor . <p> How would Zuma lead ? <p> If elected , Zuma is likely to be a great delegator , a man who will see his role as a traditional chief , who listens to his advisers , allows them to form a consensus , and then endorses their decision as his own . <p> " The president is going to appoint a structure in his office , where people can give advice , " says Jabulani " Steve " Mabona , a senior ANC member of Zuma 's inner circle of advisors . " He 'll have financial gurus who can give input . " <p> Unlike President Mbeki , a cerebral man who shied away from public events , Zuma will see his main role as listening to public concerns , and restoring the historic connection of the ANC with its voting base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business community for helping the national economy grow , Zuma has vowed to ensure that the benefits of that growth begin to be felt by the nation 's poorer majority . This means more spending on housing , roads , schools , health clinics , electricity , and water supply to poor urban townships , and less to the leafy suburbs of the rich . " This is why it 's important for the ANC to get a two-thirds majority , " Mabona says , " because a voter must feel that a government that is in power must have the power to change the issues that matter to people . " <p> Mabona says that people must be patient . " When the apartheid-era , white-run National Party government was in charge , the GDP was looking after only 4 million people , the whites , and neglecting 40 million , " he says . " When we came to power , we had the same GDP , but now we had to look after 50 million people . " <p> He sighs . " The expectations are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all his populism , Zuma likely will be restrained by the global credit crunch , unable to expand government spending <p> until the global economy rebounds . Yet the ANC 's close ideological partners , the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party , have already put forward a wish list of policy changes , from higher wages to better regulation of working standards . <p> Populist polarizer <p> It is this populist side that South Africans find so endearing , or alarming . <p> At political rallies , Zuma often grabs the microphone and sings a somewhat violent song from the struggle days called " Umshini Wami " ( Bring me my machine gun ) . Yet Zuma has also worked hard to gain the acceptance of South Africa 's mainly white business community , and to portray himself as a pragmatist who will keep the economy going . <p> Yet it may be Zuma 's performance on the economy - in incredibly turbulent times - that will make or break his reputation . With an unofficial jobless rate of 40 percent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's crucial mining industry , Zuma will have little room for error or extravagance . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
