Chapter One " Baby , oh baby , oh baby . " Like a hot breeze , a hoot of laughter drifted across the night-lit airfield as Finn Carver descended from the charter plane . The laughing man crossed his arms and leaned against the car parked on the edge of the Memphis tarmac , the runway lights illuminating him . " My , my , my , do n't you look good . " But Finn was in no mood for teasing . " Cut the crap , Jack . " He pitched his briefcase and overnight bag to Jack Saunders and tried to ignore the way the younger man was making a big production out of admiring Finn 's tuxedo . " Yessir . " Jack gave a long , low wolf whistle . " The storm troopers have definitely arrived . " Finn eyed Jack 's baggy Hawaiian shirt , worn loose over a pair of rumpled khakis . " I would n't talk . You could take a few fashion lessons yourself . " Jack grinned and shrugged off the criticism the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the thing that makes me so ... so me . " Behind them , the pilot hurried into the hangar , leaving Finn and Jack alone on the empty tarmac . It was past midnight , and the heavy delta air seeped beneath the collar of Finn 's white dress shirt . But humidity was n't the only thing making him sweat . He scowled , crushing that thought . Nothing on earth would put him on the run , least of all a woman . He wrenched off the sleek black jacket and tossed it in the back of the car before folding himself into the passenger seat . " Come on , Jack , " Finn called out . " It 's not like the bad guys are going to wait while you get your rocks off ragging me . " Jack stowed Finn 's bag and briefcase in the trunk , then slid behind the wheel . " I gather you want to skip the how are you 's ? " " Just brief me . " Jack shook his head . " Someday you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack- " " Just trying to save your life here , buddy . You saved mine . " " I didn't- " " You got ta learn to loosen up . You do n't want to keel over from a heart attack before you 're forty , do you ? " " Jack ... " He could give the younger man a heart attack himself and his voice clearly said so . Jack only grinned at the threatening tone . Jesus , the guy was worse than a puppy . Nothing you did put him off . But Jack held up his hands in surrender . " Okay , I get it . Work , work , work . So here 's the deal . " Suddenly he was all-business . " I drop you off at the house where the party 's at , then take your stuff to the motel . Here 's the address . " He fished a business card from his shirt pocket and handed it to Finn . " I stashed a cop at the house to keep an eye on things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and catch a ride back with the cop . " He reached into the glove compartment . " Here , " he said . " Credit cards , driver 's license , social security card . Welcome back , Agent Carver . " Finn shuffled through the identification , saw his own name printed on everything , and replaced the cards he 'd been carrying in his wallet for the past six days . He let out a tense breath and leaned back against the headrest . It was good to be clean for once . Twelve hours ago he 'd been unshaven , scouring dockside bars and low-life coffee shops for even the slightest hint of where the package he 'd been hunting might land . All he 'd unearthed were the same rumors they 'd been hearing for weeks . Something big , powerful , and nuclear was going on the market but no one knew where or when . Then Roper had contacted him , said they 'd found the girl . Finn had grabbed a fast haircut , a tux , and boarded the charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now here he was , about to resurrect a ghost . " You 're sure this is her ? " Finn asked . " People told me you had a problem with trust , " Jack said in a mock mournful voice , " but I did n't want to believe it . " He reached for a manila envelope imprisoned by the visor in front of him , flipped it into Finn 's lap , and started the engine . As the car pulled away from the hangar , Finn slipped out the surveillance pictures and swore softly . " What 'd I tell you , " Jack said . " It 's her . " " Now this is hard to believe . " " The eyes do n't lie . " Finn nodded thoughtfully . No , they did n't , but pictures did . He 'd have to see for himself . " Where is she ? " " At Beaman 's digs . Partying . Hence the party clothes . " Jack nodded toward Finn and the tuxedo he wore . " I thought Beaman just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a cynical snort . " But everyone handles grief in their own special way . " Finn slipped into silence , thinking about the woman in the pictures . He did n't know much about her , but what he knew was keeping his palms slick , even in the air-conditioned car . His record was piss-poor when it came to working with women , especially this kind . Third-rate " actress , " second-rate country singer , first-rate gold digger . Well , everyone had their talents . And clearly men were hers . Old men . With lots of money . Lucky for him that was exactly the skill he needed right now . Yeah , real lucky . " Beaman was what , " Finn said , scanning the report enclosed in the envelope with the pictures , " soul mate number four ? " " And counting , " Jack replied . " She chews ' em up and spits ' em out . Ca n't help but admire her , though . At least she 's well paid . " " Those extra bucks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay top dollar . " " That 's assuming she 'll do it . " " Oh , she 'll do it . With Beaman out of the picture , her free ride 's gone- " " She 's vulnerable , " Jack said , egging him on . " Probably lonely , afraid- " " Exactly . Just ripe for the picking . " Jack shook his head . " Jesus , you 're a cold bastard . " Not cold enough if his sweaty hands were proof . " It 's a cold world , Jack , and we 're the ones keeping it from getting colder . I do what it takes to get the job done . " Twenty minutes later Jack headed up a long winding drive that led to a large estate overlooking the Mississippi River . A columned portico set the front of the house off from the stately brick wings on either side . Greenery climbed the brick ; thickly flowering shrubs adorned the entryway . The house was old and dignified , or it had been . Right now lights blazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass-heavy music pounded so loudly through the front door Finn could hear it outside . His pulse notched up , pushed by a big fat slice of d ? j ? vu . Scanning the grounds , he checked the perimeter and picked out Jack 's cop , who was dressed as a uniformed valet . At a nod , he came to the driver 's side . Jack rolled down the window and murmured softly , " Everything okay ? " The cop knelt to window level . " Party 's still going strong . The other valet tells me it 'll rage for hours yet . " He eyed Finn curiously . " Heard a rumor they were sending in some hotshot undercover guy . If it 's you , you 're in for a real treat , pal . But I got some advice . " He leaned in close and grinned . " Make sure you hold on to your zipper . " Angelina Mercer stood in a corner of Arthur Beaman 's large , luxurious living room and watched the party swirl around her . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air-conditioning was set at arctic , and she was cold . Truth was she 'd been cold for a week . Ever since she found Arthur Beaman crumpled on the floor , dead from a massive stroke . Tears pricked her eyes but she blinked them away . God , she missed the old man . She looked around at the drunken bodies crowded into Beamer 's house . The party was exactly as he 'd specified : loud , crowded , and full of booze . He would have loved the send-off . Too bad it was n't doing much for her . She looked down at the vodka in her hand . She should be drunk ; she needed to be drunk . Trouble was , she did n't feel like drinking tonight . Darling girl , she heard Beamer 's crusty voice say in her head . Life is too short for the mopes . Suddenly she felt the old man frowning down on her from wherever the hell he was now . And more than anything , she wanted to wipe away that frown and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell with the mopes . The hell with death and loss and moving on . This party was for Beamer , and she 'd be damned if she 'd disappoint him . She raised her glass heavenward . Here 's to you , old man . She tossed back half her drink and plunged into the crowd . Finn stepped inside Beaman 's house and grimaced at the full force of the sound . Tuxedos and gowns swarmed over the plush interior . He pushed his way past the laughing group gathered under the hallway 's vaulted ceiling . Screaming to be heard over the noise , the partygoers paid no attention to him . Balloons and streamers lay in disarray over a gleaming black and white marble floor . He stepped over them , pushed some away . Someone handed him a drink , but he set it down . He needed a clear head tonight . The crowd thickened as he moved inward , black satin over white brocade . Well-fed men stood in clusters around marble sculptures . Wraith-thin women draped over expensive furniture . A few turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . A burst of laughter came at him from the sidelines , sharp as a gunshot . Somewhere someone was coking up , dropping Ecstasy or whatever designer drug was the trend of the hour . There was sex here , too . In the coatroom , the closet , in furtive corners , people mating like rats in a dark alley . And somewhere there was betrayal . Not his own this time , but it was here , he could smell it . The knowledge rose up like a sickness , the haze of booze and smoke sliding over his shoulders like a coat he had n't worn in a long while . A banner that read " Bye-bye Beamer " spanned the living-room entrance . Inside , the room looked as though it had been packed into a dice cup , shaken up , and rolled out , furniture landing every which way . Green and gold striped sofas with green velvet pillows stood uncomfortably out of place against the edges . Gilt-edged mirrors still hung on the walls , but the marble-topped tables that should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stuffed into a corner to make more room for the horde , which roiled , shifted , and all of a sudden split in two . And then he saw her . The hair was looser , the clothes outrageous , the face younger . But the resemblance was unmistakable . A shaft of something almost like fear pierced him quick and sharp . Deep down he 'd been hoping the pictures had been deceptive , that Roper and Jack and everyone else had gotten it wrong . But they had n't . She held a drink in one hand , her lithe body undulating in an impromptu belly dance while a ring of men clapped and cheered her on . Thick blond hair fell in voluptuous waves around her face and shoulders . A clingy white skirt , shimmery with silver thread , hugged the curve of her hips and exposed the top of her navel . Although it reached her ankles and the knife-sharp heels she wore , the skirt was also slashed open to the top of her shapely thigh . Encased in a skimpy , sequined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skirt . Between the two , bare skin gleamed tan and supple , and exquis-itely tempting . Your mouth 's watering , Carver . No , it is n't . He leaned into the living room 's arched entrance and watched Angelina Mercer work the room . Her long , tanned leg swung sinuously in and out of the opening in her skirt . Her smooth arms wove above her head , her hips gyrated , her eyes glittered with the challenge , Come get me if you dare . He 'd bet that every male in the room felt something move in his shorts . Including him . A final guitar chord screamed , and she upended her drink , downing every drop . " Here 's to Beamer ! " Her crowd of admirers cheered . " To Beamer ! " Ample breasts rising and falling in breathlessness , she headed out of the male circle , skin glistening with exertion . " More ! " the crowd took up the cry , stamping their feet in time with the chant . " More , more , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a good thing , " she shouted over the blare of the next song . With a laugh , she threw herself at one of the men and gave him a loud smooch on the mouth . " Get drunk , everyone ! " And she whooshed out of the circle toward Finn . He lounged against the arch , making no overt move to catch her attention . She 'd notice him soon enough . Then the man she 'd just kissed pulled her roughly back into his arms , and the problem of meeting her took care of itself . She laughed and tried to squirm away , but the drunk had her fast . " Come on , baby , let 's have a little more of that . " " Let go of me . " Rising panic edged her voice and Finn pushed himself off the entry . He strolled toward the struggling couple and casually placed an arm around the drunk , looking for all the world like his best friend . Except Finn tightened his grip , squeezing so hard that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finn smiled . " You may want more , but the lady 's had enough . " Before the guy could react , Finn spun him around until the drunk staggered dizzily and faced the center of the room . " Back to the party , pal . " He gave the man a gentle shove , and he disappeared into the crowd . Then Finn turned to the woman , who raised an amused eyebrow at him . " Well , well , Sir Galahad . Nicely done . " A cool one . Good . For what he wanted she 'd need to be cool . " Thank you . " She extended her hand in a graceful arc , as though he should kiss it . Something on her left shoulder caught his attention-an odd-shaped beauty mark or tattoo-but before he could examine it , she levered herself closer and he found himself staring into a pair of ice-green eyes . That 's right , Angelina . Come to Papa . " Not Galahad , " he said . " Robin Hood ? " She poked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manicured finger . " Whoever you are , I do n't know you . " Her breasts brushed his arm , her perfume coiled around him , and the blood went straight to his groin . Silently , he cursed his own weakness and winked at her . " Sure you do . " " Friend of Beamer 's ? " " I knew him , yeah . " She appraised him , a shrewd expression on her face . " No . I do n't think you did . " He smiled . " Friend of a friend . " She grinned back ; she had his number now . " You are a party crasher . " He did n't deny it . " What 's a party without a few uninvited ... friends ? " She dropped an arm lazily over his shoulder and looked up at him . Her hip grazed his . He forced himself to stand still and ignore the sweat starting at the back of his neck where her arm lay like a cool steel trap . She smiled , her lips promising worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A moment ago , he would have sworn her eyes looked bright , but up close the green was tinged with sadness . Weary eyes . Old eyes . Where had he seen eyes like that before ? He said , " Finn . " " Fin ? " She threw him the ' that 's weird ' look he always got when he introduced himself . " Yeah , Finn . Like in shark . " She laughed , throwing her head back . " Well , Fin , " she gave his name mock emphasis , " sharks like to swim around in the cool and the wet , and you 're all dry . " She held up her empty glass , swirling the ice . " Me , too . " Continues ...
