Oscar-winning actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson , 46 , trades corsets and curls for padding and a monobrow in her new film about an ugly but magical child minder , Nanny McPhee . Over tea , the Briton tells TIME 's Rebecca Winters Keegan why Mary Poppins got it wrong , why becoming a parent at age 40 requires a bit of extra effort and why she stores her Oscars in the loo . <P> HAIRY MOLES , A SNAGGLETOOTH  --  DID YOU ENJOY PLAYING A HAG ? This look took an upsettingly short time to achieve . It took longer to get dressed up for bloody Sense and Sensibility . <P> THE MORAL OF NANNY MCPHEE SEEMS TO BE THAT CHILDREN CAN HANDLE HONESTY FROM ADULTS . IS THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE ? They 're miles more O.K. with the sort of rigors , tragedy and innate chaos of life than we are . This understanding of chaos is something we lose as we get older . It 's a shame , because it makes us much more rigid . <P> MARY POPPINS WAS PRETTY , AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She has a magic stick . She makes space . She 's the opposite of Mary Poppins , who turns up and shows off and starts pulling things out of her carpetbag . This movie is a western . There is a situation of chaos . Then a stranger rides in and  --  using unorthodox methods  --  sorts out the situation , restores balance and then has to leave . People say , " Is it like Mary Poppins ? " Actually , it 's like Shane . <P> YOU WROTE THIS SCRIPT AS WELL AS SENSE AND SENSIBILITY . DO YOU HAVE ANY RITUALS WHEN YOU WRITE ? No . My husband restored a barn in Scotland where we partly live , and he made a space at the top and said , " That 'll be where you write . " I have n't written a bloody thing there because it was designed for me to write in , so of course I can only write in the toilet . I write longhand . I find computers so overwhelming . They seem somehow more adult than me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a nanny when my daughter was younger . She 's 6 now . The nanny was a third pair of hands . You both get so knackered . But I would say to people , For heaven 's sake , if you 're going to have kids you 've got to put the work and the time into it . Otherwise , there 's no point . Once you 're a mom , you 're not just you anymore . You 're split . It is a completely different human state . I noticed that more because I had my child when I was 40 . My tectonic plates had slid into place . Having to shift them again is something you notice . <P> WHAT ARE THE LIES WE TELL ABOUT PARENTHOOD ? That it 's so wonderful . There 's no question about that . But it 's also difficult , tiring and boring . <P> YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE ALSO ADOPTED A RWANDAN ORPHAN . HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT ? Well , we have n't officially adopted him . We work with refugees in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was 15 at the time . He had been through some awful things . He 's 19 now . I do n't like nuclear families . I think it 's very good to look beyond your tribe . <P> MOST ENTERTAINERS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CHARITABLE WORK . BUT YOU 'RE ALMOST SHY ABOUT TOUTING YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN HIV/AIDS AND REFUGEE CAUSES . WHY ? Sometimes it seems an aggrandizing thing to talk about it . I do think Live 8 and all that was excellent and people do become much more aware . But engagement is where it 's all going to change things .
