Chapter One By the time I was eighteen years of age-almost nineteen- I 'd been many things . I 'd been an orphan , a goatherd , and a slave . I 'd been a missing prince , lost and found . I 'd been a traitor 's son and a heroine 's . I 'd been a scholar , a lover , and a soldier . All of these were true , more or less . Betimes it seemed impossible that one person 's mere flesh could contain so many selves . Mine did , though . I was Prince Imriel de la Courcel , third in line for the throne of Terre d'Ange , betrothed to wed a princess of Alba and beget heirs to that kingdom with her . And , too , I was Imriel n Montrve , adopted son of Comtesse Phdre n Delaunay de Montrve and her consort , Joscelin Verreuil . Imriel . Imri , to a few . When I gained my age of majority , eighteen , I tried to flee myself . My selves . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knew me , and played at being a scholar . There I found friendship , passion , and intrigue . I found myself targeted by an enemy not of my making , and I dealt with it on my own terms . I found myself caught on the wrong side of a siege , and learned of grief , courage , and loyalty . I discovered that few people are wholly good or bad , and all is not always as it seems , including the very ground beneath our feet . And somewhere along the way , I found a little bit of healing.It was n't enough to undo all of the damage done to me when I was a child ; that , I think , cuts too deep . But enough . Enough to lend me a little bit of wisdom and compassion . Enough to face the responsibilities of my birthright like a man . Enough to let me come home , even if it was only for a while . Enough to face one last self . My mother 's son . My cousin Mavros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dark . Perhaps it is true . I never thought I would confront the mirror of my mother 's legacy . When I was fourteen years of age , she vanished from the temple in La Serenissima where she had claimed sanctuary for long years . No one has seen her since , or no one living who will confess it . Before that time , I had seen her only twice . The first time , I thought her beautiful and kind , and I loved her for it . I did n't know who she was ; nor who I was , either . The second time , I knew . And I hated her for it . I thought she was gone from my life forever , but she was n't . In the besieged city of Lucca , a man spent his life to save mine . Canis , he called himself ; Dog , in the Caerdicci tongue . I 'd known him first as a philosopher and a beggar , and last as a mystery and a bitter gift . On the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ javelin meant for me , and it pierced him through . He smiled before he died , and his last words stay with me . Your mother sends her love . So I came home . Home to Terre d'Ange , to the City of Elua . Home to Phdre and Joscelin , whom I loved beyond all measure . Home to Queen Ysandre to agree to her political machinations ; to Mavros and my Shahrizai kin . To Bernadette de Trevalion , who hired a man to kill me in Tiberium . To my royal cousins , the D'Angeline princesses ; young Alais , who is like a sister to me , and the Queen 's heir Sidonie , who is ... not . To my mother 's letters . For three years , she had written to me . Once a month the letters came , save when winter delayed their delivery ; then a packet of two or three would arrive . I threw the first letter on the brazier , but Ph ? dre rescued it . After that , she saved them for me in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single sitting , well into the small hours of the night . The lamps burned low in Phdre 's study until they began to sputter for lack of oil . I refilled the lamps and read onward . Beyond the door , I could hear the sounds of Montrve 's household dwindle into soft creaks and sighs as its members took to their bedchambers . When I had finished the last letter , I refolded it and placed it atop the others . I put them away and closed the coffer , locking it with the little gold key . And then I sat for a long time , alone and quiet , my heart and mind too full for thought . By the time I arose , it seemed it must nearly be dawn ; but I 'd grown accustomed to doing without sleep during the siege of Lucca . I blew out the lamps and made my way quietly through the townhouse . " Imriel ? " There was a lone lamp burning in the salon . On the couch , Ph ? dre uncurled . She reached over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt , illuminating her face . Our eyes met . It was still too dark to see the scarlet mote on her left iris that marked her as Kushiel 's Chosen . But it was there . I knew it was . " I 'm fine , " I said softly . " Do you want to talk ? " Her gaze was steady and unflinching . There was no mirror in the world into which Phdre feared to look . Not anymore . Not after what she had endured . I thought about what my mother had written about her . " No , " I said , but I sat down beside her . " I do n't know . Not yet . " Phdre had read the letters . It was four years ago , when my mother vanished . Because I could n't bring myself to face the task , I 'd asked her to do it , to ensure there was no treason in them , nothing that might divulge her whereabouts . There was n't . But I remembered how she had looked afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She watched me for a long moment without speaking , and what thoughts passed behind her eyes , I could not say . At length , she reached out and stroked a lock of my hair , a touch as light as the brush of a butterfly 's wing . " Go to bed , Imri . You need sleep . " " I know . " I swung myself off the couch , leaning down to kiss her cheek . " Thank you . " Phdre smiled at me . " For what ? " " For being here , " I said . " For being you . " In my bedchamber , I pulled off my boots and lay down on my bed , folding my arms beneath my head and staring at the ceiling . When I closed my eyes , I could see the words my mother had written swirling in my head . The first words , her first letter . You will wonder if I loved you , of course . The answer is yes ; a thousand times , yes . I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to tell you ? Words that you will believe in light of my history ? I can tell you this : Whatever I have done , I have never violated the precept of Blessed Elua . It is in my nature to relish games of power above all else , and I have played them to the hilt . I have known love , other loves . The deep and abiding ties of family . The fondness of friends and lovers , the intoxicating thrill of passion , the keen , deadly excitements of conspiracy . All of these pale beside your birth . I began to know it as you grew within me ; a life , separate yet contained . Our veins sharing the same blood ; my food , your nourishment . And then the wrenching separation of birth , the two divided and rejoined . When they put you in my arms , I felt a conflagration in my heart ; a love fiercer and hotter than any I had known . You will remember none of this , I know . But in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathe you , no nursemaid to suckle you . These things , I did myself . Like any fatuous mother , I counted your fingers and toes , marveling at their miniature perfection , the nails like tiny moons . Your flesh , a part of mine , now separate . The veins beneath your skin where my blood flowed , the impossible tenderness of it all . In the privacy of my chambers , I held you close to my breast and said all the foolish things mothers say . I remember the first time you laughed , and how it made my heart leap . And yes , I dreamed great dreams for you-dreams you will call treason . But above all I knew I would never , ever suffer anyone to harm you . I , who had never acted out of spite ( although you may not believe it ) , would gladly have killed with my own hands anyone who harbored an ill thought toward you . When I sent you away ... if you believe nothing else , I pray you will believe this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elua . Safe from my enemies , and safe from the intentions of the Queen . Safe and hidden , the secret jewel of my heart . If I had known what would happen , if there was any way I could undo what was done to you , I would do it . I would humble myself and beg , I would pay any price . But there is none , none the gods will accept . Instead , I am afforded a reminder harsher than any rod , that cuts deeper than any blade : Kushiel 's justice is cruel . You will wonder if I loved you . The answer is yes ; a thousand times , yes . One may be wounded in battle without feeling it . After we retreated from the first onslaught in Lucca , I was surprised to find a gash on my thigh , a gouge on my arm . And I was surprised now to find tears leaking from my closed lids . I 'd known the letters had bruised and battered my heart . I had n't known my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something I had buried since I was ten years old and I learned who I was . Now it was cracked asunder . It hurt . It hurt because I had believed myself unloved , a political expedient ; a cog in my mother 's vast ambitions . It hurt with a deep , bittersweet ache . For the laughing infant in his mother 's arms , for all that she had understood too late . I had spent so many years despising her , knowing only the proud , calculating monstrosity of her genius . It was hard to feel otherwise . Alone in the darkness of my bedchamber , I pressed the heels of my hands against my closed eyes and sighed . I could n't love her . Not now ; likely not ever . But I could begin to forgive her , at least a little bit , for the things that had befallen me . In time , I slept without knowing it , sinking into the depths of exhaustion . At first I dreamed I was reading my mother 's letters still , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many months , I dreamed of Darssanga . I dreamed of the Mahrkagir 's smile and the sound of a rusty blade being scraped over a whetting stone , and I cried aloud and woke . A figure at the window startled . " Your highness ? " I sat up and squinted at her . There was light spilling into my bedchamber . It had been the sound of the drapes being drawn , nothing more . " Clory ? " Phdre 's handmaiden bobbed a quick curtsy . " Forgive me , your highness ! " " It 's just me , Clory . " I ran my hands through my disheveled hair . " Is it late ? " Her lips twitched . " Late enough , according to messire Joscelin . He thought you might want a bite of luncheon . " " Luncheon ? " My belly rumbled . " Tell them I 'll be down directly . " No one mentioned the letters when I appeared , still yawning , and took a seat at the table . Joscelin gave me a quick assessing glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugues were there , bickering good-naturedly about who had neglected to fill an empty charcoal-bin in the garrison . " I thought we might spar later , " Joscelin offered after I 'd filled my plate . " I 'm out of practice since you 've been gone . " Ti-Philippe snorted . " You ? " " Well . " Joscelin looked mildly at him . " Somewhat , yes . " I did n't believe it any more than Ti-Philippe did . Hugues laughed . " ' Alone at dawn the Cassiline stands , ' " he declaimed . " ' His longsword shining in his hands . Across the cobbled stones he glides . Through the air his bright blade slides ' ... Oh , all right , " he added as Joscelin rolled his eyes . " I 'll stop . " I laughed , too . Hugues was kindhearted and loyal to the bone , but his poetry was notoriously dreadful . " I 'd like that , " I said to Joscelin . " Indeed , why not now ? " He glanced at Phdre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , " she said quietly . " The Lady Bernadette wishes you to call upon her at your earliest convenience . " " I see . " I nodded . " Well , good . " Ti-Philippe raised his brows . " A clandestine affair ? That 's swift work , young Imriel . You do know she 's old enough to be your mother ? " " Hmm ? " I scarce heard the comment . This was n't going to be an encounter I relished , but it was necessary and I 'd be glad to have the matter resolved . I was weary of being persecuted for my mother 's sins . " It 's not what you think . It 's ... a family matter , that 's all . She is my cousin , you know . " " Ah , well . " He grinned . " That never stopped anyone . " " Shall I go with you ? " Joscelin asked . " No , " I said slowly . " It 's ... somewhat I 'd rather do alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , then . " After our luncheon was concluded , I borrowed Phdre 's study to make a fair copy of a letter in my possession . Not one of my mother 's , this one . It was brief and inelegant , scrawled on a single sheet of parchment , a signature and a smeared thumbprint affixed at the bottom . It had been written by a man named Ruggero Caccini . In it , he divulged the details of his arrangement with Lady Bernadette de Trevalion , who had paid him a considerable sum of money to ensure that a deadly mishap befell me in the city of Tiberium . I 'd found out about it . And I 'd extorted the letter from him using a combination of blackmail and bribery . I daresay my mother would have been proud . I had the Bastard saddled and rode to the Palace . There was a sharp chill in the air , a harbinger of winter . It made the Bastard restless . I kept him on a tight rein and he chafed under it , tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good horse , though . Tsingani-bred , one of the best . I patted his red-speckled hide , thinking about Gilot and how much he 'd wanted the spotted horse we 'd seen together in Montr ? ve the day I learned my mother had vanished . I wished I 'd bought it for him , now . Gilot was dead . He 'd been one of Montrve 's men-at-arms , the youngest of the lot and the closest thing to a friend I had among them . He 'd gone with me to Tiberium , where I 'd been a plague and a trial to him . He was killed in Lucca . He 'd gone to protect me , and I brought him home in a casket . It was only two days ago that I had arrived in the City ; two days ago that we had buried him . I missed him . At the Palace , I gave the Bastard over to an ostler with the usual warnings . The footman on duty swept me a low bow . " Prince Imriel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I believe Lady Bernadette de Trevalion is expecting me , " I said . He bowed again . " Of course . " I followed him down the marble halls . The Palace was a vast place . The City of Elua is the heart of Terre d'Ange , and the Court is the heart of the City . Betimes it seems half the peers of the realms maintain quarters there . Others maintain lodging elsewhere in the City , but spend their days loitering at Court-playing games of chance in the Hall of Games , partaking of entertainment in the Salon of Eisheth 's Harp , begging an audience with the Queen or a chance to present a case before the Parliament when it is in session . The young nobles play the Game of Courtship , testing out dalliances and angling for marital alliances . I 'd never played it ; nor would I , now . I was betrothed to a woman I barely knew ; Dorelei mab Breidaia , a princess of Alba . House Trevalion 's quarters were on the third floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Bertran and I were friends . That had all changed the night he believed he 'd caught me out at a treasonous intrigue , and I had n't been back since . The footman knocked for admission , exchanging low words with the attendant who answered . In short order , I was ushered into a private audience with the Lady Bernadette in her salon . " My lady . " I accorded her the bow due an equal . She sat upright and rigid in a tall chair . Her mother had been my father 's sister ; Lyonette de Trevalion . The Lioness of Azzalle , they used to call her . She was dead , convicted of treason , along with her son Baudoin . They had conspired to usurp the throne . He had fallen on his sword ; she had taken poison . My mother had betrayed them both , and it was her testimony that had convicted them . " You asked to see me ? " Bernadette 's sea-grey eyes narrowed . " Do me the courtesy of playing no games with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had a message for me . What is it ? " " As you wish . " I handed her the copy of Ruggero 's letter . " I hold the original . " She scanned it , then nodded once , crisply . " So . What will you ? " I sighed . " My lady , what would you have me say ? I am sorry for the death of your mother and brother . I am sorry for your time spent in exile . But I am not willing to die for it . " Her hands trembled , making the parchment quiver . " And with this , you could destroy me . Destroy House Trevalion , or what is left of it . " Her voice hardened . " So I ask again , what will you ? " I sat , uninvited , on a couch . " Forswear vengeance . " Her eyes widened . " That 's all ? " " More or less , " I said , studying her . Looking for lies , looking for the fault-lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me , did Bertran know ? Or your husband , Ghislain ? " " No . " Bernadette de Trevalion closed her eyes . " Only me . It would kill them . " " Then why did you do it ? " I asked her . " Why ? " Her eyes opened ; her lips twisted . " You have to ask ? Because I hurt , Imriel . I miss my brother . I miss my mother . I grieve for my father 's disgrace , my husband 's disgrace . You ? " She shrugged . " I was willing to abide . When my son befriended you , it galled me . Still , I tolerated it . But when Bertan caught you in the midst of conspiring treason , it brought it all back . " Her cheeks flushed . " All the old hurt , all the hatred . " (
