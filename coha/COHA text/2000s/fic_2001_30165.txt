How did it start ? they always asked . When did you know ? And I always told them that it started when we were very young . I was seven and my brother was four . We grew up in Southern California , my brother and me . It was late August , and I remember how his blond hair was almost white , and as summer ended , our little arms and legs , soft like rising dough , were showing some wear and tear-scratches , scabs , and mosquito bites . On that day I was shirtless , wearing a dark green bathing suit instead of shorts . My brother wore navy Bermudas and a white T-shirt with a brown stain on the collar that was probably Fudgsicle . I carried him on my shoulders so the two of us could see the same world . We lived two blocks from South Pasadena High School , massive and daunting at our young age , with its endless squares of one-story buildings and green courtyards . The playing fields were in the back , and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the ground as I moved toward the plate ; my brother held the glove we shared out in front of him with both hands , like the steering wheel of a bumper car , as he careened beyond the pitcher 's mound , which rose , uneven , like a muffin top . He looked back at me . I stood in the batter 's box and waved him farther . He moved deeper into the no man 's land of tamped grass between the mound and second , still looking at me , wondering if he had gone far enough . " Keep going , " I said , full of confidence . He took a few more reluctant steps , as if the outfield were the deeps of the ocean and he was afraid of getting sucked in . The breeze picked up , raking my face with bracing desert heat . A real hitter would have noticed that the wind was blowing in . But I was just a kid . My brother finally stopped behind second base , in the shallow of center field . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball to myself with my right . The contact I made was crisp , but the swing was clumsy , and the ball went nowhere . I tried again , starting my swing at virtually the same instant that I tossed the ball , but the head start made no difference . The ball kicked down , thumping the ground and rolling slightly forward , not even out of my reach . It is difficult to foul off pitches to yourself , but I managed to do it . Repeatedly . It was close to 100 degrees that day , and the field seemed empty and enormous with only the two of us . All the elements that were missing from a real game-crowds , players , and their overlapping chatter-were suddenly apparent . I fouled off another . Sweat beaded on my forehead . I was starting to get angry , which never helped my game . I did n't understand how to convert frustration into usable energy . All I knew was that I should swing harder and keep trying to put the ball in play . At some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center field anymore . For some reason , he 'd begun to shuffle toward left . " What are you doing ? " I asked . He did n't answer . He just squinted at me , the sun blinding him . He pounded his tiny fist into his glove-he must have seen someone do this and decided to mimic the gesture . And he continued to shuffle , still facing me but now angling back toward the infield . " Stop moving around ! " He stopped at third base and looked at me again . Taking a few tentative steps in front of where the bag would have been , he popped the glove with his fist one more time-a sound at once more ordinary and convincing than any I 'd been able to produce between the ball and the bat . Then he sat down . " Get up ! " I yelled . " It 's hot . I 'm tired , " he said . " I 'm gon na hit it far , " I said . He did n't answer . He looked happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . He smiled , his legs straight in front of him , and clicked the tips of his sneakers together . Dried mud from some other day popped loose , tumbling out like tiny bricks . I watched as he began picking blades of grass and lining them up in a row on his thigh . In retrospect , his grin is delightful and beatific . At the time , it was the vicious , toothy taunt of a punk toddler entirely disrespectful of his older brother 's athletic prowess . So I ignored him , the little fucker . I was going to hit it hard . The bat would crack and the world would snap to attention , in a brief reverent moment , and then complete its bow before me . I would scorch the blood-red seams of the ball and send a slingshot of fire high in the air , where it would kiss the sun . Or something like that . I tossed the ball in the air , perfectly . It was on a string that slowed it down yet somehow made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smack it . I closed my eyes , grabbed the bat with both hands , felt my weight shift forward , and swung . I made obscenely full contact , absolutely authoritative . The sound was deep , different , beautiful . It was not a dribbler , but it was n't a long drive , either . It was my first screamer , a low-lining rocket , a foot off the ground . And it was ticketed directly for my brother 's head . Things do not often happen quickly in baseball ; the game has an endearing lassitude that can make you feel like you own it . But speed is speed in any game , and baseball has its fractional moments , more powerful because they surprise you-that savory shock and then the swift resolution . My brother was ready , though . In one fluid and relaxed gesture , he raised his glove in front of his face and caught the ball . I dropped the bat and looked at him . His head was still hidden behind the glove , which remained frozen and clamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , rolled the ball back to me , and the game went on . Only years later did I realize why my brother had moved from the outfield and shuffled toward third and raised his glove so fearlessly . He was only four years old , but he had watched me swing , seen the way my tosses leaned , the na-ture of the contact I was trying to make . And he knew that after all my straining and my dramatic posture of power , down the left-field line was exactly where I would end up hitting the ball . That was the day my brother moved to third base , and he never left . I told that story well . No one ever doubted the simple truth it delivered , because it was n't outlandish enough to be fabricated . It was uneven and natural ; it triggered a smile and celebrated foible . It painted him as human in a way that only an intimate could do . It was a story people liked to hear . At first I told it haltingly , but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soar , I grew more familiar with living in his reflected glow . Without even noticing what I was doing , I tightened the story and made it better . I hit the ball harder and harder , shaving split seconds off the amount of time I gave him to react . I added that brief beat of aging-sportswriter wisdom-the bit of " endearing lassitude " pablum-which made me seem smart about the poetry of the game . And I added it immediately after mentioning that I 'd hit the ball right at his head but before revealing that he 'd caught it-taking a step back from the play-by-play narrative , simultaneously philosophizing and adding suspense . I also must confess that the last part-about him keeping the glove in front of his face and then peering around it-was a fabrication . I do n't remember if that really happened , though it seems like something that might have , like something CJ would have done . Who the hell can remember all the details of a summer day twenty years ago ? Also , I usually did n't refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I told the story to a national magazine that did n't cover sports . They ran a short profile of my brother , together with a photo where he stood , shirtless , to flaunt his physique . ( " Ever since that August afternoon when he was four . . . " the snippet began . ) I told it to the female network sports reporter who , fifteen years earlier , had wanted to be the first female player in the majors and later sued her minor-league hitting instructor for sexual harassment . I told it to my brother 's unofficial biographer , a man not much older than me , a law school graduate who had decided to become a ghostwriter and wore the wobbly smile of a boy not sure he 'd get away with it . And of course I told it to my dentist , strangers at the car wash and the dry cleaner , students in my first-period honors physics class , and the woman who became my wife . And now I 'm telling it once more , a final time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view it in a different light , and to use it to answer different questions , ones that no one has ever asked . Because only after everything happened did I realize that it was n't a story about him . It was a story about me . CJ Columbus-it was a great ballplayer name . The initials made it work . They suggested boyish familiarity , a kid brother lent to the world . And the last name was n't bad , either-a red-and-blue rainbow over his shoulder blades on the back of his Chicago Cubs jersey , with its thin whisper of cobalt pinstripes . It was almost embarrassingly wholesome , a headline writer 's dream . ( The worst was behind him : his rookie year . After he throttled Atlanta with a late-inning grand slam , the first of his career , the Chicago Sun-Times declared " Columbus Slaughters Braves . " ) I believed in the power of names . I believed that CJ would not have been half the player he was had his name been Oswald or Morris . I do n't wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are not destined for lives as modern-day ballplayers . They are destined for difficult though probably interesting lives , I think , perhaps involving hostage dramas or studio apartments overrun by cats . On more than one occasion , I asked my parents where they 'd come up with our names . But those discussions , usually part of the meandering family nostalgia that accompanied coffee and dessert after bloated holiday meals , failed to yield satisfying answers . " Your mother liked Charles , your mother liked Joseph , " my father would say . " But did you like them ? " I would ask . And he would pause , knowing who was listening from the kitchen . " I liked your mother , " he would reply . I liked my name-I did n't mind the sound of Joe-but I knew that it was n't remarkable . It did n't come with expectations . But CJ Columbus ; oh , the rhythm and whir of it . It brimmed with promise . Say it to yourself if you do n't believe me . Say it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always count on hearing it at the ballpark . Public address announcers called his name each time he stepped to the plate . Then came the applause , dwindling to a murmur as he dug in , and the jittery silence of the first pitch : would he slap a single , or could he touch them all ? Would he tie the game , or win it with just one swing ? I knew who he was when he was four , but my parents must have known much earlier-when he was born , when they looked down at him on those first days home from the hospital and tried out his name , checking to make certain it would fit . And the fit was perfect . He looked up at them from his crib like a CJ , bright blue eyes full of knowing . And so my parents began waiting patiently for the day when he would live up to the obligations of his fan-friendly nickname and show us all what he was capable of . CJ grew to be six-foot-one , and he weighed one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short . He squinted a little when he smiled , but the grin was familiar , genuine , absolutely perfect . He had what baseball scouts call " the good face " - from an early age , determination and maturity chiseled it a certain way . It was the face of a ballplayer . He was the most popular baseball player in the country at age twenty-three , with that good face , with his blond hair and blue eyes . My hair is black , and my eyes are brown . We looked nothing alike . It started out as something he did , a game he played , the same way everyone else in the neighborhood played it . There was tee-ball and then Little League , with games three days a week and practices on the days in between . If you liked to play , it was heaven , and if you were good , it was easy to get much better . Owing to the agreeable Southern California climate , the league ran year round . In the late 1970s and early 1980s all the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet immolating itself through labor dispute and arrogance , not yet being eclipsed by suburban soccer leagues or by Michael Jordan and the glamorous surge of professional basketball . All our friends played baseball , and all the parents were friends . It was a closed , inward-looking world . It surrounded us , and we wanted nothing else . When we started playing , a lot of kids were good ; even I was good . That 's not saying much . I honestly believe that to be good at any sport when you 're a child , you do n't have to be talented , you do n't even have to be an athlete ; you just have to be big . ( This is true even in baseball , which is the hardest game of all . ) There was one kid , Jeffrey Carder , who was well over four feet when he was ten . He had one eyebrow and no ability whatsoever . But Jeffrey was big , and when he hit the ball , he dented it ; his swings were wild and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as someone 's head , and we wondered how long that person had to live . We respected his size as talent , and he scared the shit out of us . I played first base , largely because of my boyish infatua-tion with Steve Garvey , the indestructible Dodgers infielder with movie-star looks and Popeye forearms . Growing up , my brother and I were rabid Dodgers fans ; South Pasadena was a ten-minute drive from the team 's spectacularly beautiful stadium in Chavez Ravine . The stadium had apparently been built by muscling out large numbers of Latino families who lived in the area , though I did n't know that at the time . All I knew was that my father shared three season tickets with two co-workers , we went to many games , and we always stayed until the end and scoffed at those who could n't tough it out , those who scurried to their cars at the first lick of evening chill or hint of an insurmountable ( never ! ) visitor lead . My brother and I would fall asleep as the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled against each other , we were like two kittens . Sometimes one of the stadium cameramen would find us , and our pictures would go up on the big screen above left field . The crowd would try to wake us , but we did n't know or care . We only knew the comfort of sleep and of the organist 's lullaby ; we were in love with it all . This was back when my brother was in the middle years of elementary school and I was finishing up . We were still friends , we did things together , we did things with our par-ents-shopping at May Company on a Thursday evening , eating burgers and brownie sundaes at Big Boy on a Saturday night-things we would n't be caught dead doing with them or with each other in a few years . Since CJ and I were three years apart , our size was always classified differently , and we never played on the same team . I remember coming home from school one May afternoon-CJ was nine , so I must have been twelve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place in my own life only in relation to the important event happening in his . ) I turned the corner and approached our house . CJ was sitting on the steps to our front porch , not the place he usually hung out . Both of us preferred the claustrophobic , air-conditioned chill of the living room . Our street was flat and sleepy , and nothing surprising happened on it . CJ was still in his uniform from practice , and a large grass stain blotted the left shin of his white pants . There was a little mud mixed in , plus some dried blood where he had dived or slid or just plain fell . His dark green Screaming Eagle jersey was untucked over his right hip . Back then we were both South Pasadena Screaming Eagles . I never understood why we could n't just be the Eagles . Apparently it was n't enough to be named after an Endangered Species ; it had to be an Endangered Species that was pissed off about it . My friend Ben Clark 's mother had drawn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability but was recently divorced and tended to lose her focus . None of the other parents wanted to indicate that she was n't good at anything , so they waited and waited for her drawing . Only later did we learn that on all those dewy early mornings we 'd seen her around town , sitting on benches with her sketchpad before the heat made everything senseless , she was just staring out at nothing and waiting for life to turn for her . But she finally did draw the Screaming Eagle , the bird depicted at varying levels of agitation . To me , the assorted eagles looked startled , as if they 'd been caught in the middle of some unseemly bird behavior , but the several renditions adorned shirts , caps , and the backs of our green satin jackets . My brother 's Screaming Eagle baseball cap was between his feet , and he idly nudged it back and forth . " Hey , " I said . " Hey . " I noticed that his lips were blue , his tongue as well : Popsicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . He did n't look at me . He seemed tired , slouched back against the steps . " Mom and Dad are inside talking . " " Mom and Dad ? " It was strange for them both to be home so early . CJ nodded . " They 're talking to Mr. Covington . " Mr. Covington was CJ 's coach . He owned two Chevrolet dealerships , in Tustin and Monrovia ; he was a pleasant man , chubby and grinning . His family consisted of a wife and five daughters , and all those boys on all those teams were the sons he never had . He marveled over every single thing they did , good or bad , with the same expression of startled delight . " Covington ? What did you do ? " " Nothing . What time is it ? " I checked my watch . It was a gold Timex , red liquid electronic digital , a suspiciously heavy source of pride on my scrawny wrist . " Four-fifty , " I said . " Marvosa doubled , " CJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a benchwarmer on my brother 's team . He did n't want to play , but his parents forced him to . His father came to every game and watched his son 's sporadic at-bats while standing apart from the other par-ents and chain-smoking , grinding the butts into the dirt at his feet . Father and son drove home together in a burgundy van with tinted windows . Nicky was small and spooky ; he had a black bowl haircut , and his nose started to bleed when he came up to bat . We were scared of him , too . We understood no one . " Do you want me to find out what 's going on ? " I asked . I did n't really care if CJ wanted to know ; I wanted to know . CJ burped . " I 'm thirsty . " " So go in . " " I ca n't . " " Are you in trouble ? " But I knew he was n't . He shrugged . " What did you do in the game ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't making sense , and my response sensitively reflected that . " You 're being stupid , " I said . " Shut up , " he shot back , though his heart was n't really in it . He burped again . " You 're lazy and stupid . Stop burping . " This was the kind of conversation that kids could build a world around , but , sadly , it was the kind of comeback I would still be making to him years later . I always found it difficult to argue with my brother . Even as we grew up and my vocabulary sprawled across a much wider range of evocative adjectives and profanity , I was rarely able to articulate anything other than sputtering rage in the face of his Zen-like impenetrability . I walked up the steps and past him , my shin hitting his shoulder , granting me a flicker of perverse pleasure , though I did nothing more than slightly , momentarily buckle him . Between certain brothers , this would have been enough to start a fight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other , because our parents would not have tolerated any type of physical confrontation . When we were younger than I can remember , they must have stopped something before it could start . It was a good solution , approached with the intellectual rigor that was typical of the upper-middle-class , book-smart way they had raised us . We would grow up and have to find other ways to be cruel to each other . As I entered the front door , I saw that everyone was in the kitchen , standing very close to each other . I decided to go about my business as if theirs meant little or nothing to me . I would be mature , without needs , and therefore invisible . My parents would be too enthralled by crisis to notice that every word they said was escaping , declassified , as soon as it left their mouths . I weaved among them-Mom , Dad , Covington . I was busy and did not need direction . They ignored me , and I listened . " We 'll have to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's out of the question , " my mother said . Covington turned to her . " With all due respect , Gail , I 'm not sure you understand what we 're dealing with here . " I winced inwardly ; Covington really did n't know my mother . All Due Respect was not enough if you were implying that she did n't understand something . " He 's nine years old , Jim , " she answered . " How can you be sure what we 're dealing with here ? " Covington took a moment . When he spoke again , his voice was surprisingly calm and confident . " I 've never seen anyone do the things he can do , Gail . Your son is n't running around in circles out there . " " What things ' exactly ? " my mother asked . Covington thought about it for what seemed a long time . Long enough for me to get the milk , get a glass , and pour it . I glanced at him quickly ; he was looking down , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He understands the game , " Covington said . " I do n't know how else to explain it . " A silence followed , and I felt myself joining my parents in trying to understand this statement . My mother was staring at Covington , squinting and trying to make sense of him . But my father was looking at me , as if noticing my presence for the first time . He smiled , the kind of smile that said please leave now . I took my Oreos and milk into the living room , put them on the coffee table , and turned on the television . He understands the game . The words rocked me-the first external confirmation I 'd heard that my brother was different and somehow better . There was awe in Covington 's voice , even a tremor . This man had coached hundreds of kids . What could CJ have possibly done , and in only a scrimmage ? Was it a sparkling defensive play , or a great at-bat against an overpowering , oversized reliever ? I could n't imagine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the ball to the plate or a third baseman could plant and throw to first . Covington left a half-hour later , and nothing was ever the same . My father adjusted his work schedule so that he could drive my brother thirty miles to play in a different , elite league in Santa Monica . It was called Babe Ruth AA-Select , like some deluxe cardboard carton of eggs . And I was introduced to the game of tennis . My mother , who to my knowledge had never picked up a racket , insisted that the game was best suited to my physique and intellectual temperament , as if tennis were a bride my parents had chosen after mulling over several applicants . I believed my mother , because I did n't expect her to lie . But what my parents really wanted was for the two of us not to be competing . We were no longer a pair of Screaming Eagles-two brothers who played baseball together on a couple of unambitious neighborhood teams . My parents were not athletes ; they deferred to Covington and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly logical leap . They did n't think I could handle a younger brother who was so much better than me at something we both did . They were probably right . So I embraced their low expectations . I 'd finish the spring baseball season , but would soon become the older brother who played catch for fun . The brother who liked to watch , who could name all the Dodger players-the kind of useless knowledge only nonplayers flaunted . But then I became the brother who hated baseball altogether , who thought it was stupid and slow and boring . This probably did n't bother my parents ; I do n't think they loved baseball either . And later I became the brother who also hated everyone who played it . CJ was the ballplayer . He was the one who understood the game ; he was the one they came looking for when they came looking . But on that day , with the coach in our kitchen , the finality of it all-those entrenched positions that dictated feelings and defined relationships-was still to come . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the porch step , was pulling his Popsicle stick apart , examining the tiny splinters . He had played coy with me , but he damn well knew what they were talking about . He had done something , and Covington had seen it , and Covington had asked my brother if he could talk to our parents . I did n't remember anyone ever corralling my parents on my behalf . I was never told to wait outside . I suppose it was possible that a discussion of my future did take place , in some meaningless moment I overlooked , between breaths , focused elsewhere . And maybe , in one of life 's casual symmetries , my brother was around to overhear it , sneaking into the kitchen for a glass of soda , the only witness to a great life-changing debate . Did he tell them what should be done with me , sending me down some road between sips of his drink , sweet fizzy pinpricks that tickled him ? He never said . So I became a tennis player . I was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of elements I was required to master , even if I could never hit a topspin lob , or serve and volley without foot-faulting . And I never rose much above mediocre , probably because I practiced against a brick wall up at South Pasadena High , which forced a degree of urgency upon the game and gave me many bad habits in return . The ball would ricochet back to me much faster than it should have-much more like racquetball-and I ended up conditioned to an opposing player who was closer , and a net that was higher , than they actually were . When I returned to the court for a match , my opponent was small and the net was low , the reality fuzzy and disappointing . I wanted my wall back . And my mother was wrong about my temperament , or she was right and I changed my personality merely to prove her wrong . If a call went against me during a set , or if I made one critical error , I would plummet to earth like flaming wreckage : launching forehands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole match over in a matter of minutes . But after the match , I 'd quickly forget the loss and go cheerfully about my business . Losing never ruined my entire day , just the part of it when I was actually playing , when the loss might still have been prevented . In any event , I was too distracted , and there was far too much new noise inside my head . I had discovered a talent for math and science , but , more important , girls were everywhere , in places I 'd never noticed them before . They were in front of me at the water fountain , leaning down , hands pulling the straight brown hair back to spare it , revealing the delicate right earlobe with its small silver hoop ; or in the front seat of another car at a red light on Fair Oaks Boulevard ; or in my stormy subconscious , their faces parading in arcs before me , like pictures of ice cream dishes on a glossy parlor menu . was moody and constantly feverish , bouncing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them flat with earnest obliviousness . My parents did their best to act as if every-thing were normal ; the best way to do this was to gather around my brother . CJ was younger , he played baseball , and he did not notice me or anyone else . Thus , he kept everyone focused . Covington vanished from our lives , fleeing his bold , soapbox-style assertions about my brother 's talent , which , in the short term , proved shockingly inaccurate . CJ struggled for the first month in the new league . Early on I watched him play against a towering and tanned team from Newport Beach . It was a beautiful day , and there was a cool breeze from the ocean that blew away any anxiety . But the plays I had seen my brother routinely make were suddenly and puzzlingly beyond him , his instincts dulled , as if he were growing old before my eyes . He could n't reach a sharply hit ball to his right that I 'd seen him swallow many times before . And at the plate he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hit , watching them float past for strikes one two and three . " Let the game come to you , " they always said , but I got the sense that CJ was letting the game come to him and watching it pass right on by . Maybe it was the separation , joining a new team mid-season-the Santa Monica Mariners , a group of boys from West LA who had more money than we did and found solidarity in ignoring him . Maybe , more specifically , it was the awkward tenth birthday party held that June , when a few of them grimly piled out of a black Mercedes station wagon and mingled uneasily with us local boys . But no one asked CJ what he wanted , because he did n't have a choice . He had an obligation to his talent . He must have known what had to be done . He understood the game . After the first sixteen games , he was batting .096 . He had nineteen errors . He was a ghost . I listened as my parents considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood that my brother had overstepped , aimed too high ; all hype . He was my brother , but he had left me behind as well . So I did n't defend him . I stayed silent and relished it as they smashed him flat . And although I assumed he was miserable , he never let on . CJ was n't one to throw his glove and sulk or burst into fits of tears-behavior that characterized many kids his age , even those who did n't play sports . He was still a kid , though it was easy to forget it . He bore the whole thing with grace . It was his first slump ; he would get out of it . And he even seemed to sense that there would be others and that he 'd manage to rise from them , too . Still , I could n't help provoking him . He refused to lean on me , and at thirteen I saw confrontation and the potential for violence in every rebuffed gesture . I was drawn to the imagined heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , I had no choice but to be cruel , not deviously , behind his back , but brutally , to his face . I would taunt him with unanswerable questions , desperate to get a rise out of him . " What 's it like to be the worst player on a team ? " I 'd ask , shaking my head , intimating genuine curiosity , gleefully unable to make sense of it all . " Do n't you think Michael Caruso or Sean McGee should have gotten a chance before you did ? " He would n't respond . He 'd just toss his glove in the air and catch it , or study the fraying seams of a dirty old baseball that had camped in the mouth of Rusty , the Houstons ' limp-legged golden retriever across the street . He 'd let me rant for twenty or thirty minutes , sitting there and taking it . " You know , Dad 's gon na lose his job because of you . He has to leave work early every day , and he 's getting fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was blatantly untrue ; my father is part of that generation where all jobs apparently have tenure-he was a seismologist at Cal Tech , and he still worked there years later . ) Finally , CJ would leave , and I 'd let him , pleased with myself , satisfied for the moment that I had inflicted heavy emotional damage . After seven weeks of lousy play and evening harassment , CJ and my father returned home one day from a game against Malibu . When the front door opened , I could tell from my father 's face that things had not gone well . He murmured something to my mother-later , I found out that a ball had darted between my brother 's legs and he had also struck out three times . CJ entered the house behind my father and quickly disappeared down the hall . Our loved one remained in a coma , athletically speaking . On the other hand , the South Pasadena Intermediate tennis team had obliterated visiting San Marino , and I had won matches in both singles and doubles . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy named Jason Wilder cut his foot on a piece of broken glass and had to sit out . I thrilled at the drama of being the Last-Minute Replacement ; though completely exhausted , I felt unusually thick-chested that night . I waited until after dinner , when CJ and I were in our room doing homework , to start on him . Our beds were flush against opposite walls . It was a room that lent itself to symmetry and imaginary dividing lines to protect private space . It was the last year we 'd share a bedroom ; I would be exiled that fall to the old guest room above the garage , with its mealy gray carpet and odd , crumbling built-in shelving , covered with possibly toxic flaky white paint and housing numerous secret cubbyholes for storing pornography . CJ was studying for a world geography test , the kind of thing that kept fifth-graders busy . He had flash cards filled with quantifiable , useless facts : the second largest city in Poland , the national anthem of Greece . I should add here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in athletics , I was not able to declare the clean , cinematic victory in academics that would have granted me consolation and calming projections of inevitable , long-term triumph . ( Besides , at that age , I would have gladly chosen dumb jock phenomenon over undersized budding brainiac any day . ) I was staring at my algebra book , bored . I looked over at CJ , shuffling the geography flash cards , mouthing answers to himself , flipping them over for confirmation . He had stacks of these cards , color-coded and organized in rubber-banded stacks on the shelf above his desk . It was my father 's idea . The room was quiet , and I decided that my brother 's recent failures were not sufficiently devastating . I had dominated in my chosen sport , a young Borg or McEnroe . He had sucked once again . " Hey , CJ , " I said . He looked up . " Let me ask you something . " I smiled at him . I expected him , knowing that I was about to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he just looked at me . " Do you think you 'll ever be good at baseball again ? " He went back to the flash cards . " I mean , what 's it like to stand out there at third and be hoping the whole time that they do n't hit it to you , because you know you 'll screw it up if they do ? What 's it like to be scared every time you go up to the plate ? " I imagined it for myself , with delight . " I 'm not scared , " he said , his voice low and bored . He kept at the cards . " You should be . You have n't hit the ball out of the infield in , like , three weeks . " " I will tomorrow . " I laughed . His confidence made my job that much easier . " You say that every day . " " This time I 'm right . " " You 're sure ? " " Yup . " He sounded so confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball 's got you beat . Maybe you do n't have what it takes . " He leaned back in his chair , stretching and unconcerned . " Nah . I figured out what my problem is . " " Right . " I laughed again , but his cool tone had begun to irritate me . " Face it . You 're terrible , CJ . People are laughing at you . You 're making the whole family look bad . " But I 'd lost him-my accusation that he had ruined the Columbus name throughout Los Angeles County notwithstanding . He got up and wandered out . I smirked , misjudging everything ; I 'd thought I could hurt him . That night , I woke up just after three a.m . I was n't startled , and I felt myself ease from sleep . The room was dark . I heard the faint whir of a truck shifting , picking up speed , carrying through the still air from some distant street . I was lying on my stomach , tangled in my comforter and constricted by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed as if part of me was itching to go somewhere . I twisted my neck and looked up . My brother was standing next to my bed . I rotated onto my back and pulled up the blanket so that both of my feet peeked out . There was little light in the room , and I was in the process of adjusting , but I could tell that it was him-though I could n't make out his expression , his eyes , or anything other than his unmistakable silhouette . For the first time , that night , I felt him tower over me . I realized how it would feel not only to look up at him , but to look up and not even be able to see him . Apparently , CJ also felt the poetry of the moment , in those elastic hours before morning . He raised the baseball bat he was carrying , his favorite Easton aluminum , and smashed it down on my exposed lower left leg . I could n't see what my brother was doing . There was a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whistling through the air an instant before the contact . A flashbulb of agony surged through my body , the hollow pop of the bone snapping inside me . CJ dropped the bat . It hit the ground hard and did not roll . He went back to his bed and sat down on the edge , invisible to me . I screamed . Lights came on , and my parents flooded into the room . Time slowed down , sped up , unrecognizable . I kept screaming . I did not know I could scream so loud . It sounded to my ears as if the scream was coming from someone else , though it definitely was n't ; my brother was sitting there , so I kept screaming to make sure I was doing it louder than this mysterious other person who was filling the room with sound . All the anger and frustration and hurt of my life had been isolated into one forgivable moment where I was allowed to yell as much as I wanted to . My father carried me out of the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good leg bent at the knee , my broken one limp and throbbing , shrouded under an oily beach towel . I closed my eyes , feeling the cool steel of the seatbelt buckle prodding my cheek , which was wet with tears . I felt a sticky dampness below my chin as well , and realized that I had thrown up all over myself . My father drove me to Huntington Memorial Hospital , where the bone was set and cast , from knee to toe . I was not going to die . It was a clean break . They gave me crutches made of cheap yellow foam and sheeny gray metal , and I took my first awkward steps with them , outside . It was around five in the morning , still cool and quiet , the sky amping slowly toward dawn . We were sent home , and I found out later that while I was being treated , my father had given a statement to a social worker at the hospital , who had been called in because the injury looked suspiciously like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting for us . She was making French toast , though she had placed a box of Cap'n Crunch on the kitchen table as well . My brother was not around . My father kissed my mother on the cheek , moved past her , and left the two of us alone . " You 're back , " she said . She did n't look up and made no effort to aid me , leaving me to hobble toward the kitchen table and collapse in a chair . She had showered and dressed , and she was beating eggs . Something was sizzling , but I could also smell that something had recently burned . Her voice was lilting and suspiciously friendly . " Does it hurt ? " she asked . " Yeah , " I said . It did . It was aching , and I expected it would throb forever . My lower left leg had seceded from my body and was in the midst of developing its own temperament and behavior patterns . At that moment , it was giving me a big fuck-you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me , and sat down . " Thank you , " I said , halfheartedly . The French toast looked blackened and overcooked . I wondered if she had burned it on purpose to punish me . I did n't have a fork and I was covered in puke . I was n't hungry . " Do n't eat it if you do n't want it , " she said . That made me feel guilty , so I started to tear at it , savagely . The logic of our family was gone . I was a different person , suddenly free to eat without utensils and otherwise behave irrationally . But in the silence , as she watched me , I quickly settled down . " It 's great , Mom , " I said , feeling some convoluted need to placate her . I kept eating . The bread was crisp and difficult ; I could n't taste it . I only felt the grit of the charred bread , mixed with the cinnamon sugar , scratching the roof of my mouth . I took smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted it to last forever , afraid of what was coming next . When I glanced up , she was staring at me . My mother was tough and smart . At that time she was a deputy district attorney for the city of Los Angeles . Her black hair was cut stylishly short , and with her pale skin and dark eyes , we looked a lot alike and even seemed to be growing oddly closer in age-she was fighting hers , and I was getting carried away with mine . " What did you do to him ? " she asked . " Huh ? " I was startled by her question . " To provoke him . What did you do to provoke him ? " " I did n't do anything ! " I heard my voice become a whine , all screechy and cracked . My eyes grew large , like an unconvincing gesture of surprise and innocence , right out of a comic book . " That 's impossible . You must have done something . " She squinted at me , not suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd given Coach Covington-the look that indicated that she could n't understand me and I was to blame for it , a gaze that said I 'm on to you . I was suddenly infuriated . " So this is all my fault ? " I gestured , but I was still clenching the crutch in my left hand . The crutch rose from underneath an empty chair and knocked the chair to the floor . I ignored the mishap , a self-conscious commitment to the intensity of my innocence . There were n't two sides to this story . Were there ? " He hit me with a baseball bat , Mom . He broke my leg . " " You must have done something , Joey . " " So ? Does that give him the right ? When someone kills someone , they ca n't just do it because they had a reason to ! " I framed the debate in legal terms , learned not from her but from watching too much television . It was my pathetic attempt at common ground . " Actually , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ! " I flipped my hand in the air dismissively . " Tell me what you did . " " Why ? Will you break my other leg if I do n't ? " She glared at me . I glared back , slowly chewing my mouthful of shitty French toast , swallowing dramatically , and never blinking or looking away . It seemed defiant at the time . CJ was not punished for what he did . He apologized , one of those mumbly numbers , in a ceremony that made all of us even more uncomfortable . I apologized as well , furious that I was forced to . I took the obvious and irritating reverse tack , enunciating loudly along the lines of : " I 'm really sorry , CJ , that I said you were a terrible baseball player and that you would never be good at anything again . " Next , I recanted bonus , ad-libbed cruelties-my final , flailing jabs-until my father guided me from the room . It was the only way I could make my apologies palatable . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us was sorry , and we never spoke of the incident for what it really was : a younger brother 's brutal act of retaliation-possibly justified in spirit if not in reality-against an older brother who had persisted in being an asshole . That afternoon , in a game against Redondo Beach , CJ had a couple of hits . It was nothing overwhelming , nothing other players on other teams had n't done thousands of times . But the hits were in a row-a single to left , followed by a double down the right-field line-and two in a row was almost a bunch , and hits bunched together made all the difference . The coaches and my parents were encouraged ; these were the first flickers of life , the fluttering eyelids of a ten-year-old giant rising from dead slumber . He was also solid defensively-no errors in seven chances . He knocked down a liner slicing into the corner over his head , holding the opposing batter to a single instead of a double . The next batter grounded sharply back to him , and he threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rally killer only possible because his first play had kept it in order . Santa Monica won two more games that weekend ; CJ had three hits in the first , including a home run . The next day he had three more hits , stole two bases , and charged a weak bunt down the line and gunned down the runner at first . Summer arrived . My cast was sawed open , and I stored it in the closet , shutting the door on the stale signatures of bored boys from the neighborhood who did n't mind crouching over my lower leg . I unzipped the cover to my tennis racket and noted emotionlessly the hole in its middle ; the strings had snapped and unraveled . I went to camp for six weeks and worked part-time for a local landscaping company that paid me under the table with a plastic bag of loose change and a deceptively thick stack of one-dollar bills . I saw Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom seven times , and I read a book of short stories by Stephen King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool ; its sudden , graphic violence felt forbidden and smutty . I moved into my new bedroom and decorated it badly . And my brother played baseball , every day and every night . He did n't start to fill out physically for another few years , but the fact that he stayed small , albeit briefly , allowed him to hone other elements of his game . He was never able to fall back on power ; his fundamentals , on the other hand , were exquisite . He was quick . He had tremendous vision . He was always perfectly positioned in the field-some of this was coaching ; some of it must have been instinct-and he made hard plays look routine . At the plate he could hit the ball to all fields , put the ball in play to advance a runner or play hit-and-run , or bat lead-off and work the count . Somehow , so young , he had managed to grasp all the elements of the game-batting , fielding , running , catching , throwing . He was n't yet great at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and balanced . At times the ebb and flow of the game seemed so natural that it was as if he 'd already played the whole game in his head , and was replaying it that day in the field for our entertainment . He played fall and summer ball with Santa Monica for two more years ; springtime was reserved for the brief , less meaningful middle school season . The boys grew up , and the Mariners went to the state championships twice but were shut down each time by a team from Sonoma that featured a genetic anomaly of a pitcher with the unlikely name of Clark Kent . Kent limited them to a handful of hits each year , though CJ had five of them . CJ immediately joined the varsity team at South Pasadena when he arrived as a freshman . People had started talking about him : the batting average over .500 , the remarkable defensive range and perfect mechanics , the composure and comportment beyond his years , maturity that even many pouty pros still lacked . There were always lots of good high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it , but most of them had already peaked . They were destined to be superstars in only a minor constellation , but they were also so young and blindered and full of confidence that they refused to believe it . CJ was told the same stories , with their same unbelievably happy endings . Were we wrong to think they were real ? There were college and professional scouts watching him play ; they circled around each other , squinting and chewing gum and calculating , watching my brother-men falling in love with the sun on his great good face . I was in the twelfth grade when CJ arrived ; it was the first time we 'd been in the same school together in seven years . We were civil to each other but traveled in different spheres . I gave him a ride to school each morning , but we did not speak of anything important , and after practice or games he found his own way home . We had no friends or interests in common . I had long ago given up tennis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was focusing on school , on getting good grades and getting into a good college . This was territory over which I still had some control . For every story you tell there 's one that you do n't . Most people thought that CJ played all the time , cultivated his natural gifts , and flourished . But I knew better , even though , in many ways , I never really knew him at all . When I was seven I moved my brother to third base . The world knew all about that . But all those years , under the radar of inquiring minds , was the second story-of how , when I was twelve , I helped him to succeed there . CJ had told me that he knew what was wrong . He knew why he was n't playing well . A few hours later , in the middle of the night , he swung and did not miss . He could have caved in my skull , shattered my face and disfigured me , or cracked my knee and made me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing to me ; he was doing it for himself , the way we all acted out , more often in small and everyday ways , to quiet something inside . After that , CJ began to surpass expectations instead of slumming beneath them . My broken leg was an anecdote to which I added no drama . There was a neatness to it that I instinctively mistrusted , but not everything that was obvious was also false . I rolled it over in my mind so many times that I had no choice except to embrace it , because even if it was no more than a comforting , delineating lie , I could not outrun it . Baseball players struggle at the plate ; it is a fact of life . They bring their hands together or close their stance , raise their elbows , bend their knees . They watch tapes , study opponents , burrow into themselves . Most of them never figure it out . Baseball is a game of failure ; my brother faced it down early . All he needed was contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was something I helped him to hear and feel . He had looked down on me that night when we were young ; he had waited for his confident gaze to open my eyes . Then he found his voice , there was a gorgeous realignment , and the music began .
