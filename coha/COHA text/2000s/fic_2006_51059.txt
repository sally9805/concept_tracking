Diane holds the map in her hands and turns it counterclockwise . She notices how awful her dry , broken thumbnails look , and she tilts the palms of her hands upward to conceal them . " This is the park where we were dropped off , so I think we are here somewhere . " Diane taps Zhonglu Road with her index finger and hides it back under the map . " But I 'm not sure . We want to go here . " She traces the green line of Nanjing Road several blocks north . " This is where the market is . I just do n't know how to get there . " They are standing on the busy Shanghai street . Diane has dismissed their driver prematurely . <p> Lavinia says , " Look , there 's the sun . " She points to a vague glow in the thick afternoon haze . " That 's west , so north must be behind us . " She unfolds her arms with the slow motion precision of a cheerleader miming a letter . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest navigation by compass along one of Shanghai 's busiest streets . Lavinia takes the map from her . Diane lifts the bottom of her T-shirt and wipes her forehead . <p> " No , look-here we are . " Lavinia has triumphed . " Right here-on Zhonglu between Shangxi and Shimenlu-so if we cross under that bypass " - Lavinia looks up and points to the thick concrete pillared structure several hundred feet in front of them- " and walk two blocks north on Shimenlu we should be just around the corner from the market . " <p> Lavinia and Diane stand behind a handful of Chinese pedestrians and bicycles saddled with cargo . Soon they are surrounded by more bicycles held motionless by men and women in simple clothes of worn-out colors . As if responding to a secret sign , the Chinese pedestrians walk into the eight lanes of moving traffic as if the cars and trucks and vans do not exist . They pass in front of the vehicles with perfect timing . Diane has only seen this in the cartoons her children watch . When the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bicycles have moved around and in front of them . Lavinia waves at a small child on the back of a bicycle who turns his head to watch the woman with a red headband tied around her yellow hair . With the bicycles safely in front of them , Lavinia and Diane hurry but only make it halfway before the light turns red , and they are trapped . They cling to the side of one of the thick concrete pillars supporting the overpass . The light changes color again , and Diane and Lavinia run across the remaining lanes to safety . <p> Diane is determined to go back to the market she visited last year when she accompanied her husband to Shanghai for the First Annual Fortune 500 Global Conference . On the second day of the conference she skipped the Organized Activities for Spouses and found her way to a large flea market she had read about in a guidebook . She had admired a number of old shutters she had seen propped against one of the stalls , but she could not think of what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the lobby of the new Hyatt hotel for the second Annual Fortune 500 Global Conference and saw the carved interior panels of shutters mounted and framed and hung on the walls , she knew what she would do . When her panels are framed and hanging in her house on Brynwood Lane in Greenwich , Connecticut , she knows her guests will think she has a good eye . <p> Diane is now wondering what had come over her to include Lavinia . Perhaps it had something to do with seeing pale blond Lavinia overdressed in that pink and white off-the-shoulder taffeta number at last night 's opening reception at the Shanghai Art Museum . Diane and her husband , Mark , had been helping themselves to a tray of mini rice and crab cakes , when Lavinia , shadowed by a small Chinese man with straight white hair in a pageboy cut , wandered by and asked them if they had seen her husband , Peter . " Peter , " she said , " was tied up in a meeting and left a message for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had asked Diane and Mark , " Have you seen Peter ? " or it could have been the contrast of Lavinia in her Southern belle ball gown with the other women in their little black dresses worn just above the knee . It raised a protective instinct in Diane . <p> Lavinia always appeared slightly lost and always by herself , wandering around looking for Peter . Lavinia had asked Diane and Mark to join her on the private tour of the museum planned for her husband . The curator , Dr. Wong , did not mind that Peter had failed to appear . He led them into the Bronze Rooms and showed them the museum 's most prized possession , a wine vessel made in the second century B.C. for reputedly the most beautiful woman in China . He stood with his head bowed in front of the vessel for a few moments before moving on to explain the difference between pottery and porcelain . In choppy English , Dr. Wong pointed out the Ru ware , the china made for an emperor in the twelfth century who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . He showed them the pale white bowls with sides so thin light could pass through , and he explained that no one has been able to imitate this technique first practiced in the fifteenth century . He showed them the eighteenth-century porcelain fired to imitate the appearance of materials such as red laquerware , bronze , gold , glass , and wood . <p> " By then , the craftsmen do anything they want . They showing off . " Dr. Wong used hand gestures to replace the verbs he was missing . <p> Dr. Wong led them to a table where pairs of plates and bowls and vases were set side by side . " Today , many , many fakes . Very good fakes . " He pointed out the minute differences between the authentic and counterfeit . He raised one of the counterfeit vases shoulder level as if showing off a trophy . " Find these in market sometimes . Be careful . " Diane looked more closely at the pieces on the table , but she did n't see any that could compete with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . <p> Now safely on the other side of the highway , out from under the shadow of the wide overpass , they walk along the street , frequently stepping aside to avoid oncoming bicycles laden with packages . Diane fans the folded map under her neck . The streets have been swept clean , but the air is heavy and stale . Diane inhales dirt with each breath . She will be happy to return to her back terrace and fill her lungs with the sweet soft air of Greenwich . They walk down Shimenlu , a wide European-style street lined with sycamore trees . On either side of the street are large houses built at the turn of the century for wealthy Europeans . The architecture reminds Diane and Lavinia of houses they have seen in Switzerland . Most of the houses have gardens enclosed by large stucco walls that have long ceased to protect them . The buildings and walls are charred by grime and pollution . Laundry hangs from each window on bamboo poles . Electricity meters and clumps of wires hang in nests along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings is complete and compelling , and Diane and Lavinia can find nothing to say to one another . This is not the world of European extravagances and scandalous echoes they have read about . <p> At the end of the second block on Shimenlu , Lavinia consults the map once more , and they turn left at the intersection . " I think this is the right way . " The echoes of European elegance are left behind . They walk down a street of dirty rectangular concrete buildings . The bottoms of the buildings are open stalls selling mechanical and industrial supplies . They pass a few stalls selling roasted meats and stews . The combination of the thick smells of diesel and industrial oils mixed with overcooked meats hurries Diane and Lavinia along . <p> " Last year there were all these stalls set up in the middle of the road with people selling animals . There were all kinds-grasshoppers and birds in cages , kittens , rabbits , snakes . I even saw puppies dyed the colors of the rainbow . " Diane pointed . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal market is only on certain days . " <p> Before Lavinia can register dismay over the multicolored puppies , they discover the mouth of the flea market . Diane is pleased . Small stalls and shop-fronts form boundaries on each side of a street . " This is it , " Diane says triumphantly . " This is it . We 'll hit one side on the way down and the other on the way back up . And if we have time let 's look for ShangART . I do n't think it is too far away . Someone told Mark last night it was the hot place to buy art . " <p> As Diane and Lavinia browse , the stall tenders rise from low stools to stand in front of their Chinese porcelain , lacquer trays , worn articles of clothing , pieces of embroidery , ornamental swords , guns , opium pipes encrusted with semiprecious stones , and necklaces of wooden , ceramic , and jade beads . Some say hello with the precision of trained myna birds and hold out pieces for them to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lid . She handles it delicately . Diane comes over . " What is it ? " she asks . <p> " I do n't know , " Lavinia says with an air of wonder . " Perhaps a soap dish . " She lifts up the lid . " I remember my grandmother having a box like this on her dressing table , and she always called- " <p> " It 's an inkpot . " Diane takes the object from Lavinia , turns it sideways , and points to a dark blue irregular patch on an inside corner . " Look at that ink stain . Definitely an inkpot . " Diane returns the inkpot to the table . " Let 's keep moving . " <p> About two-thirds along the way , Diane spots what she has been hoping to find . In a stall next to a store with its name , The Great Merit Hall , written in Chinese characters with the English below , a shutter is leaning against the back wall . Without saying anything , Diane goes straight to the shutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over on both sides . The panels are highly carved , and the border is painted a bright gold . The shopkeeper , a squat woman in dark dirty clothes , comes over . " You like ? " she asks with a smile . Her sallow skin is thick and cracked , and her teeth are stained , and a few are missing . Diane shrugs her shoulders and turns the corners of her mouth down . The bargaining has begun . <p> Lavinia wanders across the road . She stops in front of a stall and looks at a display of horn-rimmed eyeglasses . Some appear to have their original tortoise-shell cases . " They are from the 1930 's , " the minder of the stall answers Lavinia 's question before she can ask it . " Back then it was a great luxury to have eyeglasses . " The minder stands up . He is Chinese , unusually tall and thin , and wears old khaki trousers and a mandarin-collar shirt with the sleeves rolled up . Lavinia guesses he is in his thirties . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent . He looks like an intellectual , a teacher , perhaps . She steps into his back room and looks at a pile of textiles neatly folded on a table . She finds an old Cantonese shawl of pale beige silk with embroidered flowers , birds , and butterflies , some fragments of court robes , and several collars of alternating blue and green and red silks with embroidered dragons . <p> Lavinia turns to leave . A wooden case of a gramophone tucked underneath a table catches her eye . " Is that a gramophone ? " she asks . He nods and squats down in front of it . His long legs fold into two , and Lavinia ca n't help but think how thin he is . He slips his hands under opposite sides and slides the gramophone carefully from underneath the table . His hands are elegant with long and sinewy fingers , and Lavinia wonders if they are not the hands of a musician-a pianist or a violinist , perhaps . The gramophone emerges with its tulip-shaped speaker . She touches the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " From the thirties ? " she asks . He nods and tells her he would play it for her , only he does n't have a record . He stands and smiles down at her with a smile that seems to acknowledge her refined aesthetic sense , her shared understanding of a romantic life that no longer exists . <p> Lavinia says she will think about it . He nods his head and waits for her to leave his shop before he sits back down on his stool . Lavinia finds Diane where she had left her . Diane stands with her hand on her hip and says something . She does n't take her eyes off the Chinese woman . The woman selling the shutter responds , and Diane shrugs her shoulders and steps away . This happens four or five times . The woman keeps looking at Lavinia , and Lavinia feels as if the woman is asking for her assistance . Finally Diane nods her head and says , " Okay . " The Chinese woman dips her head and smiles . <p> Diane hoists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusts her balance . " I should have kept on going . I know I could have gotten it for less . " Bargaining is all about intensity and concentration . Lavinia 's presence allowed the woman to break the hold Diane had on her . <p> Diane asks Lavinia if she found anything . <p> " Well , there was this old gramophone . You know the wind-up kind with the morning glory-shaped speaker . I was rather taken with it . " <p> Raising one eyebrow , Diane probes , " Would Peter like it ? " She blows her sweaty hair away from her face . <p> " I think Peter would adore it . You know he has this collection of forty-fives from the sixties . Would n't it just be wonderful to play them on a gramophone ? " <p> Diane has received the signal she needs . She stops abruptly and stabs the ground with the end of her shutter . " Let 's go get it , " she commands . <p> At the appointed hour of four o'clock , a dark blue Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of the market . He parks illegally , rushes around , and opens the door for Diane and Lavinia , putting his hand in front of the car top to prevent any heads from getting bumped . Diane 's South China Morning Posf-wrapped shutter fits in the trunk , but Lavinia chooses to hold the gramophone on her lap . <p> Safely nestled in the back seat of the air-conditioned Mercedes , they marvel at the gramophone sitting on Lavinia 's lap . Diane leans over and looks closely at the gramophone . She raises the arm as high as it will go . " I do n't think it has a needle , " she says . <p> " What do you mean ? " Lavinia asks . <p> " Look . " Diane again raises the arm as high as she can and points to the underside of the tip . " Do you see anything ? " <p> Lavinia tilts her head to look . " No , no , I do n't . " <p> " Here , let me see that . " Diane holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane . As she does the bottom of the wooden box comes loose and drops on the seat between them . Lavinia tilts the gramophone diagonally on its side and looks up under the box . The box is completely empty . There is no mechanism inside the box . She looks at the pieces of the gramophone . She looks at Diane . Her face is motionless . <p> " How could this be ? He told me it worked . Why would he have told me it worked when it did n't ? " <p> " It does n't matter-it still looks great . " <p> " I must go back and show him this , " Lavinia says . <p> " Believe me , it 's not worth it , really . I doubt it would have sounded very good , anyway . Besides , without the mechanism it 's lighter and easier to move around . I would n't make such a big deal of it . My shutter is not old . It just looks old . Who cares ? It 's how it looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the point . It 's the principle . And I 'm not making a big deal of it . He told me it worked . I really must go back . " <p> Diane makes one last attempt and suggests to Lavinia that she come with her to the pashmina sale at the hotel . " You 'll make up in savings on pashminas what you spent on the gramophone . It will all even out . " <p> While Diane is wrapping cashmere pashminas around her neck in the large conference room on the first floor of the Shanghai Hyatt and trying to decide which color-aqua-green , lemon yellow , or pale peach-suits her best , Lavinia finds the stall across from The Great Merit Hall and steps inside . She holds the gramophone in front of her . She looks for the tall , thin man who sold her the gramophone . He is not there , only a Chinese woman who looks like the woman who sold Diane the shutter . She sits on a low stool in the corner . She rises when Lavinia enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here . " <p> The Chinese woman shakes her head and presses her lips together . <p> " Where is the man ? " Lavinia speaks each word slowly as if she is dropping a heavy sack on the ground . <p> The woman shakes her head again . Lavinia puts the gramophone on the ground and with a mixture of mime and sign language tries to communicate that the gramophone does not work . The woman watches and signals she does not understand . Lavinia stops her elaborate pantomime and says , " I want my money back . He told me this worked . It does n't . There 's nothing inside . Look . " She points her arm toward the object on the ground . The woman looks at the gramophone and shakes her head again . <p> " English , do you speak English ? " Lavinia 's voice becomes stronger , and she takes a step toward the woman , who stands up as Lavinia moves closer . " English . I need to find someone who speaks English ? Who speaks English ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . The Chinese woman 's dark eyes register nothing and then , almost imperceptibly , shift sideways . Lavinia turns and looks behind her . There gathered in the doorway are several stall keepers . Lavinia asks them , " English , do any of you speak English ? " The Chinese woman now moves between Lavinia and the gathering crowd of stall keepers and takes hold of Lavinia 's arm and tries to turn her away from the small crowd . <p> Lavinia snatches her arm away . " No , no , I need someone who speaks English . " Lavinia drops down on her knees in front of the gramophone . She opens the palms of her hands outward first toward the Chinese woman and then to the small crowd in the doorway . " Look , there is nothing inside . " She tilts the gramophone on its side . " Nothing . No good . " She shakes her head and looks up at the crowd . <p> The Chinese woman says something to the growing number of Chinese stall keepers . One disappears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He speaks quickly to the Chinese woman . She points to Lavinia , who is still kneeling next to the gramophone , and then to the floor of the stall where they are standing . Lavinia tries to listen to the rapid exchange , but she can not recognize any of the sounds that are made by the two speakers , who seem to form the words at the back of their throats without moving their jaws . The exchange reaches a high pitch and then stops abruptly . The Chinese woman shrugs her shoulders and looks away . The man nods his head and turns to Lavinia . <p> Lavinia rises . " I want my money back . The man who was here sold me this gramophone , and there is nothing inside . Look . " Lavinia stoops down again and tilts the gramophone on its side . " Nothing . Nothing at all . " <p> The Chinese man looks back at the Chinese woman and says something sharp to her . She snaps back . <p> " She can do nothing . Only man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is walking barefoot on sharp rocks . <p> " When will he be back ? " <p> The Chinese man turns to ask the woman when the man will be back , but before he can translate the woman answers sharply and looks at the ground . The man turns to Lavinia and says , " She not know . " <p> " I feel sure she knows when he is coming back . Look " - Lavinia points to the woman- " she understands English . " <p> " She say not know . " <p> " But he is coming back ? " <p> The man turns toward the woman and asks the question in Chinese . She nods her head and shrugs . <p> " Yes , " he says , turning back toward Lavinia . <p> " Well , then , I will just have to wait . " Lavinia looks around and retreats to a rusty metal folding chair in the corner . The Chinese woman says something to the man , and he turns to Lavinia . <p> " She say you not stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay right here until I get my money back . " <p> " You come back tomorrow . " <p> Lavinia waves him away . " No , no , you said he will be back , and I will wait for him . " She tucks her denim skirt around her legs and smoothes the fabric across her lap . " It 's not right , and it 's not fair . " She repeats the phrase with each sweep of her hand . <p> The Chinese man turns and observes Lavinia and then speaks to the woman , who speaks back rapidly and loudly and snaps her arm toward Lavinia . He speaks harshly to her and with a lift of his chin directs her to sit back down on her stool . She grunts back at him and crosses her arms across her chest , but does as he commands . <p> The man turns to the stall keepers who are still standing in the doorway . While he is shooing them away with harsh sounds , the Chinese woman looks at Lavinia and spits on the dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says in clear English with just the slightest touch of an English accent . <p> The four words fill the space . Lavinia stops smoothing the creases in her skirt . She is struck by the complete absurdity-she-a crazy red head devil . Yet there is something about the image that she likes , something wild and exotic , even dangerous , she who has never done anything daring in her life , a crazy red head devil . She smiles at the woman . She corrects her posture and adjusts her red hair band . <p> Lavinia rests her purse on her knees . The Chinese woman watches Lavinia lay a hairbrush , a black billfold with interlocking Cs , two tubes of lipstick , and a bright pink memo pad with matching pen on her lap . Lavinia peers into her purse and pulls out a long red lanyard with Fortune 500 printed repeatedly on it and a photo ID clipped to the end . Lavinia puts everything except the Fortune 500 lanyard back into the purse pocket organizer her sister gave her for her birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pale blond woman who looks slightly confused could be called a crazy red head devil . <p> The Chinese woman watches Lavinia . She says something to the man as he steps back into the stall and cuts her eyes back to the lanyard folded neatly on Lavinia 's lap . The man uncrosses his arms and walks over to Lavinia . He drops his shoulders . His hands fall to his side . He offers Lavinia the option of trading the gramophone for something else . <p> " I do n't want anything else . " He does not respond . Lavinia feels compelled to fill the pause that follows . " All right , then , give me back ninety percent of what I paid , but I do n't feel I should leave until I have my money . " As she makes this offer she watches his eyes change . The muscles of his face relax . There seems to be some recognition they are on the same side . They negotiate . She will get half of her money back . <p> " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no changing her mind . " This is how Diane explains to her husband why she had allowed Lavinia to go back to the Chinese flea market by herself . " I always wondered if she is as nave as she comes across . But she is , " she said , peering down to apply a coat of clear nail polish to her thumb and index finger . <p> " I tried to tell her it was n't a big deal . It still looked pretty great . She was taking everything so literally . I told her my shutter was n't old . It just looked old . Who cares ? I even offered to take her to the sale in the lobby to look at pashminas . " <p> Two hours later when the organizers of the conference learn that one of the sponsors ' wives has failed to show up for the six p.m. reception for the Mayor of Shanghai , six police cars are dispatched . Diane is in the front seat of the lead car and is once again pointing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six Chinese policemen walk down the street . They turn down alleyways where groups of people sit huddled smoking cigarettes and drinking tea . <p> While the police are holding a copy of a spouse ID photo and asking if these people recognize the blond woman who smiles sweetly back at them , Lavinia has left the market with her bills of yuan tucked in the pocket of her denim skirt . She does not know where she is going , but she is no longer worried . She will study her map and find her way back . She returns to the park where her adventure with Diane started . She sits on a bench . She watches a young Chinese woman with a small child sit down on the bench opposite . The child wriggles off the woman 's lap , and the woman gets up and collects a handful of rocks from the graveled path and gives them to the little boy , who amuses himself by arranging the stones in a loose circle . He picks out a stone and leapfrogs it around the stones in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges it for the stone in his hand and continues the game until he has found the largest stone . Lavinia watches the little boy play the game in reverse . He starts with the largest stone and leapfrogs until he has found the smallest stone . He hides the small stone in his hand and surprises his mother . Lavinia studies her map and figures she can walk back to the hotel . It may take her hours , but it is something she can do . <p> Lavinia sets off down a small side street . As she turns onto a main thoroughfare she runs straight into ShangART . She is pleased . This is the gallery Diane had wanted to find . She steps inside and is met by a small man dressed in black with pointed black boots . She asks if he speaks English . He says yes in a thick German accent . Lavinia asks if she can have a look around , and he nods his head . He asks if there is anything in particular that interests her . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . He disappears into a back room and sends out a young Chinese girl . She hands Lavinia a card with one side printed in Chinese characters , the other in English . She translates her Chinese name into English as Chaos . Chaos says she will be happy to answer any questions . Lavinia asks Chaos to tell her about the pictures . Chaos shows her a painting of Mao with a flower coming out of his mouth and another with a worker in military dress in a t'ai chi pose with the words " NO ROLEX " painted in capital letters . Chaos describes the pictures as being a combination of Dada and pop art with oblique political messages . Lavinia asks Chaos which picture she likes the best . Chaos smiles and walks over to a small painting on the floor . <p> " It is by Lie Ju . He is from Beijing , but he studied in Germany . " Chaos points to a painting of three angels . One looks out over the ocean with a telescope at something invisible to the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl , and the third sits on the floor with a magnifier glass and examines a painting of Mondrian . The angel with the magnifier glass wears a beret , and Lavinia can not be certain whether the touch of red on his forehead is the ribbon of his beret or a lock of hair . <p> Lavinia 's husband is in the VIP room at the hotel . He punishes the carpet with dull thuds as he walks back and forth across the room . Mark , Diane 's husband , sits on a sofa with one hand covering one ear and the other hand holding a mobile phone . He has an open line to Diane , and he is trying to hear what she is saying . <p> " I want the entire police force out there looking for her . " Lavinia 's husband speaks to no one in particular . <p> The dinner banquet honoring the Mayor of Shanghai has just begun . Behind each of the one hundred and forty tables stands a beautiful Shanghai girl in a traditional red silk dress . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of a fourteen-course meal , Lavinia walks into the hotel lobby . Her small painting is tucked under her right arm . She looks into the faces of the liveried Chinamen all lined up with their white-gloved hands clasped behind their backs . They rush to help her with her painting . She smiles and gently says , " No , no thank you , I am fine . " She turns and walks to the entrance of the ballroom and looks out over the vast room filled with people seated at dinner . Lavinia does not see her husband , but she will find him . She touches the heels of her shoes together and raises ever so slightly on the balls of her feet . For once she does not consider what she is wearing . She steps inside . <p> Author Affiliation
