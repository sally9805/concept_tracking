Photograph // This time of year every sharp gust of wind breathes life into the Chesapeake Bay . Arriving with each new front , geese and ducks gather by the tens of thousands in the wetland maze that defines this low  --  lying landscape . Their winter presence transforms the bay 's marshes and tidal waters into a birder 's paradise and a photographer 's dream . Nowhere is that transformation more dramatic than at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on Maryland 's Eastern Shore . One of the state 's largest conservation areas , the refuge spreads across more than 24,500 acres that encircle a wide stretch of the Blackwater River , 12 miles south of Cambridge . By November 's end , some 50,000 waterfowl have taken up boisterous residence within the refuge 's marshes , ponds , and creeks . Glenn Carowan , refuge manager , has watched Blackwater 's seasonal dance of migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , " he says , " starting around the middle to the last of August . From there the annual migration just continues to progress . In September we start seeing some green  --  winged teal , and then the geese start to arrive sometime around the last week in September . Generally by Thanksgiving most of our birds are in the area . " During the days of early winter , upwards of 35,000 Canada geese congregate here . Many of these same birds have been coming to . Blackwater for years , traveling south on the leading edge of the cold from their breeding grounds in northern Quebec , more than 1,000 miles away . Boldly patterned in black , brown , and white , each adult Canada sports a distinct white cheek patch that resembles a kind of tall Victorian collar . An average bird weighs around 8 pounds , with a wingspan of 5 or 6 feet , and when they mass together , their characteristic honking mimics the crowd noise that drifts out of a fully packed stadium . // Blackwater manages both crop fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the efforts are well rewarded . Lesser snow geese , mallards , pintails , black ducks , teal , and many more annually flock to the refuge along with the Canada geese . " It is outstanding from the birder 's perspective , " says Glenn , " because you 've got a large diversity of waterfowl and other migrant species as well . Plus , there may be as many as 200 bald eagles here on the refuge at any one time during January . It 's pretty astounding . I had several friends come visit from some of the more Southern refuges just after I moved here , and they were amazed at the amount of wildlife . Not very many places have the opportunity for people to see and interact with wildlife as closely as they can at Blackwater . " The refuge 's 5-mile Wildlife Drive affords best access to that diversity . It crosses the Little Blackwater River , then scallops along the northern shore of the Blackwater River , riding atop a dike that divides freshwater from tidal . It cuts through forest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marsh and the other woodland habitat . But even if you never leave your car , the views can still be spectacular , making bird watching exciting and easy for neophytes and even children . " Go in the early morning or late afternoon , " urges Glenn . " That 's the feeding period for most of the birdlife here , so they 're going to be active and moving around more . And if you get here fairly early in the morning , eagles are almost as easily seen along the Wildlife Drive as Canada geese . It 's very , very , very rare to take the Wildlife Drive and not see a bald eagle , but you need to go early . That 's just the way it is in the natural world . If you want to see wildlife , you 've got to get out early and stay out late .

Geese circle overhead , filling the air with their hoarse calls , as others cluster close together , floating calmly like a raft atop the water . It is a postcard scene from the best of the South . " We are protecting wild places for wild things , " says Glenn . " Whether or not people ever come to Blackwater , I think that 's what they appreciate about the entire National Wildlife Refuge System . They appreciate knowing that there are special places set aside for wildlife . " Surely , Blackwater in winter ranks among the most special .
