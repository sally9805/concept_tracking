1 . The Sanctuary in the Desert // PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIA // Arabia . The Sixth Century C.E. // IN THE ARID , desolate basin of Mecca , surrounded on all sides by the bare mountains of the Arabian desert , stands a small , nondescript sanctuary that the ancient Arabs refer to as the Kaaba : the Cube . The Kaaba is a squat , roofless edifice made of unmortared stones and sunk into a valley of sand . Its four walls-so low it is said a young goat can leap over them-are swathed in strips of heavy cloth . At its base , two small doors are chiseled into the gray stone , allowing entry into the inner sanctum . It is here , inside the cramped interior of the sanctuary , that the gods of pre-Islamic Arabia reside : Hubal , the Syrian god of the moon ; al-Uzza , the powerful goddess the Egyptians knew as Isis and the Greeks called Aphrodite ; al-Kutba , the Nabataean god of writing and divination ; Jesus , the incarnate god of the Christians , and his holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be three hundred sixty idols housed in and around the Kaaba , representing every god recognized in the Arabian Peninsula . During the holy months , when the desert fairs and the great markets envelop the city of Mecca , pilgrims from all over the Peninsula make their way to this barren land to visit their tribal deities . They sing songs of worship and dance in front of the gods ; they make sacrifices and pray for health . Then , in a remarkable ritual-the origins of which are a mystery-the pilgrims gather as a group and rotate around the Kaaba seven times , some pausing to kiss each corner of the sanctuary before being captured and swept away again by the current of bodies . // The pagan Arabs gathered around the Kaaba believe their sanctuary to have been founded by Adam , the first man . They believe that Adam 's original edifice was destroyed by the Great Flood , then rebuilt by Noah . They believe that after Noah , the Kaaba was forgotten for centuries until Abraham rediscovered it while visiting his firstborn son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom had been banished to this wilderness at the behest of Abraham 's wife , Sarah . And they believe it was at this very spot that Abraham nearly sacrificed Ismail before being stopped by the promise that , like his younger brother , Isaac , Ismail would also sire a great nation , the descendants of whom now spin over the sandy Meccan valley like a desert whirlwind . // Of course , these are just stories intended to convey what the Kaaba means , not where it came from . The truth is that no one knows who built the Kaaba , or how long it has been here . It is likely that the sanctuary was not even the original reason for the sanctity of this place . Near the Kaaba is a well called Zamzam , fed by a bountiful underground spring , which tradition claims had been placed there to nourish Hagar and Ismail . It requires no stretch of the imagination to recognize how a spring situated in the middle of the desert could become a sacred place for the wandering Bedouin tribes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , not as some sort of Arab pantheon , but as a secure place to store the consecrated objects used in the rituals that had evolved around Zamzam . Indeed , the earliest traditions concerning the Kaaba claim that inside its walls was a pit , dug into the sand , which contained " treasures " magically guarded by a snake . // It is also possible that the original sanctuary held some cosmological significance for the ancient Arabs . Not only were many of the idols in the Kaaba associated with the planets and stars , but the legend that they totaled three hundred sixty in number suggests astral connotations . The seven circumambulations of the Kaaba-called tawaf in Arabic and still the primary ritual of the annual Hajj pilgrimage-may have been intended to mimic the motion of the heavenly bodies . It was , after all , a common belief among ancient peoples that their temples and sanctuaries were terrestrial replicas of the cosmic mountain from which creation sprang . The Kaaba , like the Pyramids in Egypt or the Temple in Jerusalem , may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navel spot " : a sacred space around which the universe revolves , the link between the earth and the solid dome of heaven . That would explain why there was once a nail driven into the floor of the Kaaba that the ancient Arabs referred to as " the navel of the world . " As G. R. Hawting has shown , the ancient pilgrims would sometimes enter the sanctuary , tear off their clothes , and place their own navels over the nail , thereby merging with the cosmos . // Alas , as with so many things about the Kaaba , its origins are mere speculation . The only thing scholars can say with any certainty is that by the sixth century C.E. , this small sanctuary made of mud and stone had become the center of religious life in pre-Islamic Arabia : that intriguing yet ill-defined era of paganism that Muslims refer to as the Jahiliyyah- " the Time of Ignorance . " // TRADITIONALLY , THE JAHILIYYAH has been defined by Muslims as an era of moral depravity and religious discord : a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and plunged the Arabian Peninsula into the darkness of idolatry . But then , like the rising of the dawn , the Prophet Muhammad emerged in Mecca at the beginning of the seventh century , preaching a message of absolute monotheism and uncompromising morality . Through the miraculous revelations he received from God , Muhammad put an end to the paganism of the Arabs and replaced the " Time of Ignorance " with the universal religion of Islam . // In actuality , the religious experience of the pre-Islamic Arabs was far more complex than this tradition suggests . It is true that before the rise of Islam the Arabian Peninsula was dominated by paganism . But , like " Hinduism , " " paganism " is a meaningless and somewhat derogatory catchall term created by those outside the tradition to categorize what is in reality an almost unlimited variety of beliefs and practices . The word paganus means " a rustic villager " or " a boor , " and was originally used by Christians as a term of abuse to describe those who followed any religion but theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike Christianity , paganism is not so much a unified system of beliefs and practices as it is a religious perspective , one that is receptive to a multitude of influences and interpretations . Often , though not always , polytheistic , paganism strives for neither universalism nor moral absolutism . There is no such thing as a pagan creed or a pagan canon . Nothing exists that could properly be termed " pagan orthodoxy " or " pagan heterodoxy. " // What is more , when referring to the paganism of the pre-Islamic Arabs , it is important to make a distinction between the nomadic Bedouin religious experience and the experience of those sedentary tribes that had settled in major population centers like Mecca . Bedouin paganism in sixth-century Arabia may have encompassed a range of beliefs and practices-from fetishism to totemism to manism ( ancestor cults ) - but it was not as concerned with the more metaphysical questions that were cultivated in the larger sedentary societies of Arabia , particularly with regard to issues like the afterlife . This is not to say that the Bedouin practiced nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is every reason to believe that the Bedouin of pre-Islamic Arabia enjoyed a rich and diverse religious tradition . However , the nomadic lifestyle is one that requires a religion to address immediate concerns : Which god can lead us to water ? Which god can heal our illnesses ? // In contrast , paganism among the sedentary societies of Arabia had developed from its earlier and simpler manifestations into a complex form of neo-animism , providing a host of divine and semi-divine intermediaries who stood between the creator god and his creation . This creator god was called Allah , which is not a proper name but a contraction of the word al-ilah , meaning simply " the god . " Like his Greek counterpart , Zeus , Allah was originally an ancient rain/sky deity who had been elevated into the role of the supreme god of the pre-Islamic Arabs . Though a powerful deity to swear by , Allah 's eminent status in the Arab pantheon rendered him , like most High Gods , beyond the supplications of ordinary people . Only in times of great peril would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expedient to turn to the lesser , more accessible gods who acted as Allah 's intercessors , the most powerful of whom were his three daughters , Allat ( " the goddess " ) , al-Uzza ( " the mighty " ) , and Manat ( the goddess of fate , whose name is probably derived from the Hebrew word mana , meaning " portion " or " share " ) . These divine mediators were not only represented in the Kaaba , they had their own individual shrines throughout the Arabian Peninsula : Allat in the city of Ta'if ; // al-Uzza in Nakhlah ; and Manat in Qudayd . It was to them that the Arabs prayed when they needed rain , when their children were ill , when they entered into battle or embarked on a journey deep into the treacherous desert abodes of the Jinn-those intelligent , imperceptible , and salvable beings made of smokeless flame who are called " genies " in the West and who function as the nymphs and fairies of Arabian mythology . // There were no priests and no pagan scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods remained silent . They regularly revealed themselves through the ecstatic utterances of a group of cultic officials known as the Kahins . The Kahins were poets who functioned primarily as soothsayers and who , for a fee , would fall into a trance in which they would reveal divine messages through rhyming couplets . Poets already had an important role in pre-Islamic society as bards , tribal historians , social commentators , dispensers of moral philosophy , and , on occasion , administrators of justice . But the Kahins represented a more spiritual function of the poet . Emerging from every social and economic stratum , and including a number of women , the Kahins interpreted dreams , cleared up crimes , found lost animals , settled disputes , and expounded upon ethics . As with their Pythian counterparts at Delphi , however , the Kahins ' oracles were vague and deliberately imprecise ; it was the supplicant 's responsibility to figure out what the gods actually meant . // Although considered the link between humanity and the divine , the Kahins did not communicate directly with the gods but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such an integral part of the Jahiliyyah religious experience . Even so , neither the Kahins , nor anyone else for that matter , had access to Allah . In fact , the god who had created the heavens and the earth , who had fashioned human beings in his own image , was the only god in the whole of the Hijaz not represented by an idol in the Kaaba . Although called " the King of the Gods " and " the Lord of the House , " Allah was not the central deity in the Kaaba . That honor belonged to Hubal , the Syrian god who had been brought to Mecca centuries before the rise of Islam . // Despite Allah 's minimal role in the religious cult of pre-Islamic Arabia , his eminent position in the Arab pantheon is a clear indication of just how far paganism in the Arabian Peninsula had evolved from its simple animistic roots . Perhaps the most striking example of this development can be seen in the processional chant that tradition claims the pilgrims sang as they approached the Kaaba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am. // You have no partner , // Except such a partner as you have . // You possess him and all that is his . // This remarkable proclamation , with its obvious resemblance to the Muslim profession of faith- " There is no god but God " - may reveal the earliest traces in pre-Islamic Arabia of what the German philologist Max Muller termed henotheism : the belief in a single High God , without necessarily rejecting the existence of other , subordinate gods . The earliest evidence of henotheism in Arabia can be traced back to a tribe called the Amir , who lived near modern-day Yemen in the second century B.C.E. , and who worshipped a High God they called dhu-Samawi , " The Lord of the Heavens . " While the details of the Amirs ' religion have been lost to history , most scholars are convinced that by the sixth century C.E. , henotheism had become the standard belief of the vast majority of sedentary Arabs , who not only accepted Allah as their High God , but insisted that he was the same god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jewish presence in the Arabian Peninsula can , in theory , be traced to the Babylonian Exile a thousand years earlier , though subsequent migrations may have taken place in 70 C.E. , after Rome 's sacking of the Temple in Jerusalem , and again in 132 C.E. , after the messianic uprising of Simon Bar Kochba . For the most part , the Jews were a thriving and highly influential diaspora whose culture and traditions had been thoroughly integrated into the social and religious milieu of pre-Islamic Arabia . Whether Arab converts or immigrants from Palestine , the Jews participated in every level of Arab society . According to Gordon Newby , throughout the Peninsula there were Jewish merchants , Jewish Bedouin , Jewish farmers , Jewish poets , and Jewish warriors . Jewish men took Arab names and Jewish women wore Arab headdresses . And while some of these Jews may have spoken Aramaic ( or at least a corrupted version of it ) , their primary language was Arabic . // Although in contact with major Jewish centers throughout the Near East , Judaism in Arabia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Jews shared many of the same religious ideals as their pagan Arab counterparts , especially with regard to what is sometimes referred to as " popular religion " : belief in magic , the use of talismans and divination , and the like . For example , while there is evidence of a small yet formal rabbinical presence in some regions of the Arabian Peninsula , there also existed a group of Jewish soothsayers called the Kohens who , while maintaining a far more priestly function in their communities , nevertheless resembled the pagan Kahins in that they too dealt in divinely inspired oracles. // The relationship between the Jews and pagan Arabs was symbiotic in that not only were the Jews heavily Arabized , but the Arabs were also significantly influenced by Jewish beliefs and practices . One need look no further for evidence of this influence than to the Kaaba itself , whose origin myths indicate that it was a Semitic sanctuary ( haram in Arabic ) with its roots dug deeply in Jewish tradition . //           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
