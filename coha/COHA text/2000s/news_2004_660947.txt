<p> When the pirates came , the Pilion 's crew was ready . The skipper had already spotted two or three suspicious boats edging closer during the approach into Singapore . Finally , a boat emerged from the darkness and a man climbed onto the deck of the Pilion , a cargo ship on its way from South Africa to Japan . <p> The 19-man crew was braced for trouble . After all , they were cruising the world 's most pirate-infested waterways , where almost one-third of all reported pirate attacks take place . And they were in the treacherous waters of Indonesia , whose underpaid coast guards are suspected of sharing the spoils with modern-day Bluebeards . <p> But this time the pirates did n't get far . When several crew members stepped onto the deck to challenge the intruder , he turned and panicked , then fell into the water . The boats quietly slipped away into the inky tropical night . Within hours , the Pilion was docking safely in Singapore . <p> " This one was laughable , " says Michael Papaioannou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who spoke to the ship 's captain after the Feb. 4 incident . " But pirates can be extremely dangerous . It frightens the living daylights out of our crews . " <p> Pirates have long had an unsavory reputation , as any seasoned reader of " Treasure Island " and other sea yarns would agree . But today 's swashbucklers - motivated by greed , war , or revolutionary fervor - are plundering Asia 's coastlines with increasing violence and frequency . <p> The sharp rise in recent piracy attacks in Southeast Asia is unnerving governments as well as shippers , not least because of the strategic importance of its waterways and its vulnerability to terrorism . <p> Around 30 percent of the world 's traded goods pass through the Strait of Malacca bordered by Singapore , Indonesia , and Malaysia . <p> This channel , only 1.5 miles wide at its narrowest point , is a vital link between the Indian and Pacific Oceans . It 's also home to rebel armies , criminal gangs , smugglers , and Islamic militants who thrive in the lawless waters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The International Maritime Bureau , which began compiling piracy statistics in 1991 , says last year was the second-worst on record , with 445 actual and attempted attacks on merchant ships . Of those , 121 occurred in Indonesia , an archipelago of 17,000 islands stretched across three time zones . A further 35 were reported in the better-policed waterways around Malaysia and Singapore . <p> Such incidents are on the rise because of increasing poverty , rebel activity , and lawlessness in Indonesia , as well as the perception that ships are easy targets , experts say . And , they add , the pirates operating in the region are well-armed , often with automatic weapons and fast boats , and are increasingly brazen . Instead of prowling the high seas , pirates are pouncing on boats close to port , and not always waiting until nightfall to attack . <p> The Pilion is a case in point : The attack occurred off the Indonesian island of Karimun , only a few hours from Singapore , the world 's busiest port . Maritime authorities in Singapore say that two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location . In both incidents , pirates took cash and valuables without harming the crew . <p> Pressure is growing for governments to curb the problem . In January , the defense ministers of Indonesia and Singapore met to discuss how to cooperate against pirates . If they do n't succeed , momentum could swing toward an overland oil pipeline in Thailand . The project would allow tankers ( but not other cargo ships ) to circumvent the pirate-infested strait completely . <p> Kidnappings on the rise <p> In general , today 's Blackbeards focus on quick cash returns rather than cargo heists , unless it 's a commodity that 's easy to repackage and sell . <p> On rare occasions , pirates will leave the crew and sail the vessel to another port to sell to a broker . <p> Others instead try to kidnap seamen and extort money from shipping companies for their safe return . It 's a practice that 's on the rise , though industry watchdogs say many shipowners prefer to pay up and keep quiet . <p> Nonetheless , the IMB recorded 399 kidnapping incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from only 191 such attacks in 2002 . <p> " The pirates usually call the owner and ask for an amount that the owners can afford . And typically they will pay , especially if they are Chinese or Singaporean , " says Noel Choong , who heads the IMB 's piracy watch center in Kuala Lumpur , the Malaysian capital . <p> Some owners refuse to pay up - with tragic consequences . <p> In February , four seamen were shot dead by Indonesian pirates and dumped into the sea after a shipping company refused to pay a $ 12,000 ransom . Police said four bodies later found washed up on a beach in north Sumatra were among 13 crew members held by pirates since Jan. 5 . The vessel was carrying palm oil when it was intercepted . Police said the remaining hostages were released unhurt . <p> Last year saw a doubling in deadly assaults on merchant seamen and a fourfold increase in the number of crewmen injured . In all , the IMB reported 644 acts of violence , almost double the 327 recorded in 2002 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed that country ahead of Indonesia in the tally of the world 's deadliest waters for merchant ships . <p> But it 's the plight of ships transiting the Strait of Malacca and braving Indonesia 's lawless waters that raises the loudest alarm . <p> Lurking behind the human and economic risks of moving cargo is a more troubling question : Could the Malacca Strait become a soft target for terrorists trying to hit maritime targets ? <p> Singapore certainly thinks so . Last November , its defense minister , Teo Chee Hean , warned that oil tankers could be used as floating weapons to cause devastation in the region . <p> " For terrorists , the payoff from a successful attack could be considerable . The damage could be horrific if terrorists turned supertankers ... or chemical carriers into floating bombs , " he told a maritime conference in Singapore . <p> Al Qaeda was blamed for a suicide bombing of a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen in October 2002 that replicated a similar nearby attack on the USS Cole two years earlier . <p> A terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit docked US naval vessels using a smaller boat rigged with explosives , a tactic copied from the USS Cole . Its members were later arrested before they could move on this and other deadly plots . <p> Terrorism in the Strait of Malacca ? <p> Terrorist experts point out that Indonesian pirates have occasionally hijacked tankers and piloted the vessels before escaping , raising the possibility of plans afoot to strike in the Malacca Strait . Tugboats used to guide larger ships into port have also gone missing over the past year . <p> Others say that it would be easy to acquire a suitable vessel through proxies if this was the intention . <p> " We have n't seen evidence of terror groups investing in maritime equipment yet , but that does n't mean they wo n't in the future , " says Rohan Gunaratna , a professor at Singapore 's Institute for Defense and Strategic Studies . <p> Some of the rise in piracy close to the Malacca Strait is blamed on the Free Aceh Movement , armed rebels who are fighting Indonesian troops on the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually goes unchecked by Indonesia 's feeble security response . <p> " It 's like a street mugging , except that it happens at sea , " says Papaioannou , the Pilion 's agent . <p> Crewmen complain that distress calls to Indonesian authorities often go unanswered . Shipowners say they have even received reports of Indonesian patrol boats taking part in pirate raids . <p> Whatever the reasons , Indonesia faces a massive challenge in policing its far-flung waters . Its Navy has only 117 ships , including 57 patrol boats , and many are said to be unusable . <p> Japan , which imports 80 percent of its crude oil via the Malacca Strait , has offered to help Indonesia beef up its coast guard . But it will take some time before this and other regional security cooperation efforts bear fruit . <p> Protecting cargo and crew <p> That leaves crews bracing for more uninvited visitors . <p> Shipowners say arming crews would be a risky move , and instead have insisted on strict antipiracy watches in the Malacca Strait and other pirate-infested waters . Ships use water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneak up and evade radar cover . Bright lights are employed at night . <p> Since most pirates rely on surprise , such measures do deter attacks , but they may not keep away the most determined raiders , says Adam Young , who is writing his thesis at Hawaii University on piracy in the Malacca Strait . <p> " It 's like locking the doors of your car . If it 's a casual thief , they will move on to the next target , but if they really want your specific car , there is nothing you can really do , " he says . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
