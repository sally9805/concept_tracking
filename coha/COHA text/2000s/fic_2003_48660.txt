The Price <p> PRICE , THE IMMENSE WHITE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARD who with his shrimpy white partner patrolled the white suburb at night , was perched on a stool too small for him at the counter , teasing me with dirty jokes as he drank his coffee and ate the four-egg omelet I had prepared for him . The new suburban 24-hour Dobbs House-a dozen high stools , a high counter , no tables-was a kind of franchise diner , serving steaks , hamburgers , hashbrowns , and breakfasts . For the summer of 1962 , when I was fifteen , and for forty cents an hour , I was working the 8 P.M. to 6 A.M. shift , mopping and cleaning , and in the small hours , when scarcely anyone was around , I was learning from the night cook how to prepare everything on the menu , whether there were customers ordering it or not . Cops-city , county , and private-were the only regular customers between 1 and 4 A.M. on weeknights , and they expected free food , even though the manager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook not to give free meals to the law . So I was practicing making omelets in the excellent pebble-surfaced pan : beat the eggs to an airy froth in a blender , drop one pat of butter into the hot pan , swirl it , pour in the eggs , cook till they had set to a certain firmness , and then with a smooth circular horizontal movement of the wrist set the whole omelet in motion ( it never stuck to that good pan ) , and in one final sudden movement tilt and pull the pan half out from under the omelet and it slid up the sloped side at the back of the pan and toppled over perfectly . You had to do this with nonchalance , which is what I was mostly working on . I slid the omelet onto a clean plate and swung around to lay it with a flourish on the counter , before a uniformed officer . <p> Price looked to weigh about three hundred pounds , and with his shrimpy partner he would come in already laughing at the obscenities with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Reggie , would you suck a whistle-clean whipped-cream cock ? " A negative answer brought the schoolboy reply , " You dirty cocksucker . " Besides the cooking , I was also being given a brief supplementary class in the sort of male socializing that so effectively enforces a coarse , complacent , apparently aggressive , but mutually nonthreatening code of voluntary idiocy . <p> " Reggie , you know we dropt a new ingine into the Ford , " Price said after he had swallowed the last large mouthful of the omelet and hash-brown potatoes and smacked his lips after his last gulp of coffee . <p> He was waiting for me to respond . " Why djew do that ? " I asked him . <p> " Car wad n't in bad shape , but dit n't have the power we wantid . Like to see it ? " <p> I did n't know if I would like to or not , but Price had to be humored . I think that at his worst , his little eyes , both mean and mirthful , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fantasies of gore and his own wonder at how far he might go toward something brutal in the midst of his ostensible duties in law enforcement . But , mostly disappointed , all he did was reconnoiter over and over the sterile curved streets of the small white suburb around us , peering from his car around the bare trunks of the pines , but there were no bad guys of the only kind he wanted to conceive-masked black intruders out to steal , rape , and kill ; instead there was probably only the usual proportion of white Protestant home-owning men with solid jobs who nevertheless stole from the company or hit their wives or kids or drove drunk . Price had nothing to do with that . Even the real police scarcely did . And he could neither have passed the exams for any police force nor , given his obesity , met the physical requirements . However , I did not entirely dislike him . He was the fat boy grown up who had never had a pretty girlfriend and would always be lonely . He poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as private cop , and into engine power . <p> My night boss-white , in his thirties , taller and even thinner than I , very stooped , very laconic , and highly deliberate in the even distribution of his pilfering from the Dobbs House provisions , hoping not to be caught-would remain behind the counter all night , reading the newspaper I would steal for him from the box outside , which , with exactly the right motion of the wrist-I practiced it like practicing the making of omelets-could be shaken open . I took off my white apron and paper hat and went around the counter to the customer area . Pretending more enthusiasm than I felt . But also , I think I was-how sad ! -a little flattered . Men like this usually did not consider me a full citizen of the real world , given my youth , my scrawniness , and something about me that was already , in their terms , perhaps overly refined . At that time , I must have weighed only about 120 pounds , although I had already attained my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price and his partner out the door and across the small parking lot , in the midst of the sleeping suburb , I must have looked like the chosen comic contrast to both Price 's bulk and his partner 's short stature . If my night boss even looked up , it would only have been to laugh silently and sourly to himself , as he often did about one thing or another . <p> Inside the Dobbs House , the air conditioning was wonderfully extreme ; outside , even at 3 A.M. , the damp heat was remarkable . Houston 's summer daytime temperatures were usually in the nineties , but what cast you down was that even when the night air reached its coolest , perhaps around 4 A.M. , the temperature could still be in the eighties . Around us were the scruffy ordinary loblolly pines and live oaks that had been avoided resentfully by the bulldozers clearing the lots for new houses ; these were cleverly tucked in among the spared trees . Having survived the wrath of the machines that had roared and droned as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luxury of shade . On each side of the small Dobbs House parking lot were pines sixty feet tall . <p> There were no cars on the road at this hour . The nearby houses were completely dark . The silence was complete and pure , as if before a conductor 's downbeat at the opening of a performance . At the patrol car , which was marked with the name of a local private security company and painted so as to suggest cops but not actually resemble the cars of the real cops , Price opened the hood-which in those days you did without unlatching it from inside the car-and it swung up on its powerful spring , retreating as if glad to do so from an enormous quiescent engine . Whether this was new or not , and whether it was impressive , I would not have known , as I had scarcely ever had any interest in such things ( although beginning the next school year , I did eventually get to be a little proud of how quickly I could change a flat tire , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big floating used white Plymouth that Daddy had supplied so that I could drive all of us to school and back ) . <p> " You gott to hear it , " Price said in the quiet of the night , and he opened the door on the driver 's side and eased himself , with a practiced move , into the car , which sank heavily several inches on his side . His partner stood a few yards away as in the dark I dutifully leaned over the brute engine , waiting , and then Price hit the button for the siren and I leapt away scrambling backwards and landed on my can while Price was laughing a lot and his partner a little . There was no new engine . There was a new , extra-fierce siren that attacked with a rising steady shriek . Price had already killed it after only three eternal seconds , and now he climbed out of the car , which rose gratefully on its springs . He stood over me and said , " Loudest thang you ever did hear , wad n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their laughter , forcing it a bit like a soft wordless duet as we walked back into the cool Dobbs House , as brightly lit as an operating room , where the manager glanced at me with an expression of both pity and superiority . <p> After Price 's aural blow to my ears , I was not able to hear normally for hours . I would continue to feed him free omelets , and would still have to offer my captive grin when he told the very occasional customer beside him at the counter of his practical joke . And indeed Price said several more times to me over the next weeks , " It was really the loudest goddamned thang you ever did hear , wad n't it , Reggie ? " In this , if not in much else , his judgment was good . <p> I had taken the job despite my father 's skepticism about my planor perhaps he was n't ready for me to be in the world , somewhere , working as he had to do every day for so little . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had assigned me in earlier years , which I truly hated : mostly painting the house during those endless , unbearably hot summer days . Yet Daddy had found the job for me . I had been playing for three years on a cheap clarinet , and I wanted to buy a good one . I would use the old clarinet for marching band only . <p> At that time the best I could have found , a Buffet , made in France , cost about three hundred dollars , which would be a whole summer 's earnings . It was money I could not ask Daddy and Mother to pay . And I badly wanted that clarinet , perhaps in part because this was the instrument that I myself had chosen ; no one among Mother 's musical family , the Lubowskis-neither her parents nor her siblings-had ever played it . And I wonder now if the clarinet was not also a good pretext for the satisfaction of another of my desires-to cross over from the realm of mere youth into an adult world , on my own : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would drive me a few miles to the Dobbs House in the evening and drop me off there , and then in the early morning he would return to pick me up . <p> I was entitled to one free meal per shift , in addition to my hourly wages . At the Dobbs House , I thought the food was excellent , and I ate all night long , although still without succeeding in putting any weight on my body , and then when Daddy arrived in the morning at six , when my shift and the night cook 's ended , I would get out of my apron and hat , sit down beside Daddy on the customer side of the counter , and ask the franchise manager-who came in at that hour and who paid my wages and the night cook 's and who was irritated that his provisions always seemed lower than they should have been-for an enormous breakfast . Daddy would pay for his and I got mine free . Companionably we would eat together in that very early hour of coffee-the workers ' hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air very faintly , the long shadows of the pines seemed cool even if they were not , and the quiet world was awakening again and might be better . <p> Daddy would drive us home , leave me there , and go on to his working day . Inside , where it was supposed to be cool but was n't , I could never get properly to sleep as everyone else was waking up . Besides Gary 's need to go in and out of what was after all his room , too , with unavoidable noise , I could hear the nearby front door opening and closing all day . Mother 's car departed from and arrived back at the near end of our driveway , only a few feet from my head , on the other side of the thin wall . The unsparing morning sunlight pierced our ineffectual blinds . Even the hole that my irrevocable shotgun blast had torn in the wall , which had never been repaired on the inside , seemed to leak the outside heat into the room . Through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look into our room , as if considering an exploration , but then would retreat . If it feels strange to try to sleep in daylight and to work at night , for anyone , then it is worse for a boy in his teens whose whole being is confused in every rhythm of life as , whether he resists or acquiesces , he feels his body and his soul struggling clumsily to attain the adulthood of our species . <p> By the end of the summer I had saved the three hundred dollars , and with a good friend , also a musician in the high-school band , I took the bus for nearly an hour from Spring Branch to downtown Houston , where H &; H Music on Caroline Street was my familiar destination . From time to time we went as on a pilgrimage to that one-story sanctuary with big display windows where we might breathe the atmosphere of the divine and from which we would return inspired and renewed in our pagan enthusiasms . The atmosphere inside had in fact a very earthly scent-a combination of plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple and rosewood of violins and violas and cellos and guitars , the new circuitry of wires and resistors and capacitors in the portable electric guitar amps , the walnut of mindless metronomes and the paper and ink of reams of printed music , the valve oil for brass instruments and the reeds for oboes and bassoons and saxophones and clarinets . . . . The store lay in a block of downtown Houston which , like almost all of them at that time , was wide , sun-bleached , depopulated , slightly thrilling to us because of its proximity to the illicit night life of downtown , which was frustratingly invisible to us by day . Where were the denizens of the seedy clubs and the performers of the strip joints , the secret gamblers , the prostitutes ? Also , downtown spiced human encounters with the visible , unexpungeable reality of race . Which Spring Branch did not want to think about , or even see much evidence of . Crammed into the first chamber of the somewhat labyrinthine store stood drum sets . In a kind of inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were guarded . I told the salesman that I wanted to buy a Buffet clarinet , and that I wanted to play all the ones he had in stock . My friend already had a Buffet ; he , too , had earned his own money for it ; his father , whom I liked , was a cook . My friend watched me coolly . As if to see if I might get the better of him in my instrument , if not in my performance . I had imagined there might be ten Buffets , but there turned out to be only three . As if I were about to choose from among dozens at the factory in France , as I had heard that real musicians did , I assembled the three and , having brought my own mouthpiece and reeds , tried each one several times till I thought I had an opinion about which was best . This was intuitive-for some subtle responsiveness to me , as a player , and also for a lack of resistance of some equally subtle kind . To the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows if I was even capable of choosing the best instrument ? I paid the three hundred dollars in cash . The salesman polished the silver keys . <p> And I left carrying the gorgeous clarinet in its beautiful black hard case , which in turn was zipped inside a dark-tan snug canvas protective cover . This was one of the very happiest moments in my life so far . Getting knocked down by Price 's police siren had been more than worth it . <p> The clarinet has a singular woody sound , almost buzzing in the lowest notes , shrill in the highest , hooting and lively in the midrange ; you feel the column of air vibrating through the body of the instrument and into your own head , especially when you pull the sound up and catch it somehow in the back of your throat to produce a glissando like the one that opens Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue . Tilting the head back slightly , dropping and squaring the chin to form the embouchure , and articulating the notes with the very tip of the tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyebrows tend to slant up at the center of your forehead with the effort and concentration , which can give a gently mournful look to the clarinetist 's face , your practiced breath lasts and lasts through the long phrases , and you replenish it with a sudden intake of air that fills your lungs almost instantly . A slightly temperamental instrument , the clarinet draws out of you the body language that you have to speak in order to be able to play it-the sitting posture , the leaning forward and back that the body wants to do and does during certain passages , the diaphragm and the breath pushing steadily , the shaking of the shoulders and the head just slightly , jauntily , from side to side when playing certain jaunty notes and phrases , the full tones of slow melody somehow always tinged with melancholy that almost seems to come out of the ebony itself . And my clarinet was entirely my own : my idea , my labor , my money , my choice , my practice , my ability , my good or poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although not really to wail . <p> In the high-school band , which I first entered with my friend a few days later in the tenth grade , I rose quickly in the clarinet section and was playing among and above girls a year and two years older than I-almost all clarinetists were girls : Brangwen , Alma , Shirley . . . . From the back of the bus on band road trips to away football games , the flat Texas plains had a forever-the-same look ; late at night , when we were on the way home after a win , or just as often a defeat , in which we had all over-invested ourselves , the world seemed to come closer , even if-while we stole kisses or merely the warmth of each other-it remained beyond understanding , in the lighted roadhouses where couples were drinking and dancing to jukeboxes , the dark commercial buildings , the filling-stations with night attendants , the far-off flaring gas flame , which we could not hear roaring , at the top of an oil refinery stack . . . . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans and marched in the parades and then got out of our hideous scratchy wool uniforms-which we had to wear even in late-summer heat for the first football games each season-and we walked the French Quarter in the evening avid for an alcoholic souvenir and agog at the self-abandon and self-display on the streets and just inside the doors of the clubs and bars we were not supposed to enter . <p> We maintained a kind of semisecret society of intonation , attack , crescendo , musical allusion . With some friends I ( at the piano ) formed a six-piece non-rock band , and at a few social events we played pop songs and show tunes and imitated the solos of big-band stars , past and present ; we fantasized about the career of arranging for show orchestras and big jazz bands . We held music before ourselves , in our conversation and in the act of playing , for we were denning ourselves with it , so as to have selves . <p> The odious director of the symphonic band was a man of some musical taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight song and the expected marches by Sousa and others at football and basketball games , but also , in concerts and competitions , pieces composed for wind instruments , or transcribed for band from orchestral works by Carl Maria von Weber , Hector Berlioz , Paul Hindemith , Ferde Grofe , Vincent Persichetti , William Schuman , Ralph Vaughn Williams , Dmitri Shostakovich , Gustav Holst , Alberto Ginastera , and others ; we performed Leonard Bernstein , Norman Dello Joio , Morton Gould . We performed Percy Grainger 's extravagant orchestration , for winds , of English folk tunes , Lincolnshire Posy , so seductive to the players-and medley arrangements of insipid show tunes . Frederick Fennell came for one day to work with us as guest conductor . We were excellent . <p> In regard of chastisement , the band director-of medium height , about forty , bald , irritable , and energetic-was not so different from a preacher . He often wore a suit . He acted as if he had been given by conviction and by God the right , the responsibility , to insult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to choose another church . This same director was also in charge of the marching band , which , because it had to be larger than the symphonic band and thus drew into its ranks students who had not been selected for the symphonic band , was not musically as polished , although it was seen and heard by many more people . In the few moments between finishing our indoor rehearsal and going outside to practice our marching and formations , I put away my beautiful Buffet and attached a lyre-shaped miniature music stand , which held tiny music sheets in a spring-steel grip , to my old clarinet , which liked being outside and thinking itself good for something that the Buffet would not do . <p> The head football coach 's absolute dictatorship of the football field was reproduced , in small , during the practice sessions of the marching band , as the director buzzed angrily among us , more frantic as the Friday night game approached-a community ritual intensely observed in Texas . Our stadium held ten thousand spectators . Finally , on the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were marching at midday under subtropical sun , we pounded and blasted and piped our rehearsed half-time show , and then suddenly silent , we broke ranks and , to the steady march-tempo clacking of drumsticks against the chrome rims of the snares , we crowded quickly off the field and back into our assigned seats low in the stands . From their locker rooms the gladiatorial teams returned , mercilessly chastened by their coaches , and the band director allowed our trumpet players to bugle for or to our football team as it warred up and down the field of white lines , noisily clashing the armor that the crowds , making their own noise , could not hear . My pals and I cheered , groaned , played the school fight song . From the celebrating , honky-tonk , or pious Texas night , beyond the stadium , came from time to time in a quiet moment when some player lay injured on the field the sound of a semi straining in low gear , the whistle of a freight train , a siren . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I found Mrs. H , with whom I would begin serious study of the classical piano repertoire , and after I had rebelled against the rather poor classical teachers I was used to , Mother let me take lessons from two middle-aged lounge pianists at a local piano store , the sort that displays a number of white spinet pianos in its little showroom , and in cramped back-room studios provides undemanding lessons in playing popular music . One of the teachers , with a German name , was tall , somewhat bent , and , because of his susceptibility to the rampant allergens in our moldy , inland horse latitudes , always disconcertingly and unsuccessfully trying to clear his sinuses by stopping his breath and then explosively snorting it out through his nose . This had become a tic , and he did it even while playing . A musical hack , he seemed a disappointed man , slow moving , of skimpy vital energy , easygoing , friendly . He preferred talking to teaching . In his studio , which was only big enough for the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he taught me show tunes and got me into the bad habit , which I was never afterward entirely able to break , of extending my left hand to reach a tenth instead of learning to " comp , " as pianists called it , with tightly bunched blue-note chords voiced more jazzily . After a while , I no longer remember why , I switched to the other teacher , who was a much better pianist ; he had an Italian name and was short , chubby , bald , excitable , and loved above all other pianists George Shearing , so he tried to teach me a very different way to play , which is to say , another way to hear . Then I left them , and the stuffy-smelling studios with very scuffed white walls , and began to go to Mrs. H 's house for lessons in classical repertoire , again . But not before I was musically equipped to improvise and perform the hotel-lobby tunes I had learned from the tall and the short , the German and the Italian , teachers . Mrs. H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful , eager , childless woman of about forty , had two good grand pianos side by side in her studio-the room that had been intended as a dining room in her conventional ranch-style brick house . I had never before played a grand piano , and I began to hate practicing on Mother 's sluggish little spinet , which produced only a muffled sound and few effects of contrast , sonority , or speed . I did not then sense the emotional aura around that instrument-the residue of its status as a gift , long before , to Mother from Daddy , and its symbolic value in the musical family of the Lubowskis . <p> My closest friend was L , an excellent violinist . Friend literary , musical , and spiritual . In our senior year of high school , coddled by favorite English teachers of whom we were both favorites , L and I would occasionally sneak past the boundaries of decorum and socialize with them after school hours , go out with them for pizza , even show up at their apartments unannounced , hoping to crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were young and single , two women and one man . ( My tenth-grade English teacher , beautiful and also single , had seemed very formal , and in my crush on her , I was too young to indulge even my imagination ; but by eleventh and twelfth grades , I let myself be narrated , so to speak , in my fantasies , by the attractive young women teachers in their first jobs , in their early twenties , who in class sat behind high tables , not desks , and wore very short skirts . ) L and I read good poems , wrote very bad ones . We talked of books . At L 's house , we played together through some of the very same musical pieces-although I did not then know they were the same ones-that Uncle Dan had presented forty years earlier in his youthful performances , like Saint-Saens ' Capriccio , and we went out sometimes as volunteers to play together for the inmates of nursing homes . ( I lacked the courage to go to the very nursing home where my grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We offered schmaltzy versions of the show tunes I had learned from the lounge pianists ; L knew some of these already and had an easy time playing others by ear . Off the tops of our heads we gave the old people the kind of songs that insisted both in lyrics and in melodies that the world was lovely . " I Could Have Danced All Night , " we wordlessly avowed , even though we did not want to , and the old ladies no longer had the strength to , and might never have had partners willing to . We swooned musically , hamming but not too much , with " Fascination , " for we knew somehow that the memories or illusions of romance were anodyne . L and I played in the All-City Youth Symphony Orchestra , under a conductor who was , of course , volatile . ( There too I kept myself in the second chair , not wanting to have to hit those solos in Rimsky-Korsakov 's Capriccio Espagnole . ) Sophie 's husband , my grandfather Maurice , had died in 1959 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L took lessons from another Polish emigre , Michael Wilkomirsky , who lived in a trailer house and turned out to have known Maurice . ( The well-known Polish violinist Wanda Wilkomirska was said to be his sister . ) Although Maurice repaired violins and the city was musically small and there were not so many such emigre musicians in it , Wilkomirsky would not tell me anything about Maurice . His reticence seemed to imply not that he knew nothing but that he preferred not to say what he knew . <p> While I was preparing for my biggest performance , L won an audition to solo with the Houston Symphony Orchestra in a summer concert . But having won it , he did not want to play the date , and he never took up the opportunity , traveling instead to Central America on a summer church program . I discovered the most impressive coincidence of our musical lives together when it occurred to me to hold L 's violin under strong light and peer into it at an angle through the narrow f-hole ; somehow it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Maurice 's label , recording a repair to the instrument in the 1930s . Maurice had uncannily anticipated my friendship with L before L and I were born ! - leaving where I would find it ( and where only to me , of all L 's friends and acquaintances , except for Wilkomirsky himself , would it be significant ) his mark , like a greeting from beyond the tomb : Remember ! You are one of us ! <p> And while L was following a youth minister in his very unusual church of liberal Baptists ( incomprehensible to me , for I was a living debate within myself between belief and doubt among my never-doubting fundamentalist Methodists ) , he was also proselytizing for Vedanta by pressing on me a variety of opaque and unidiomatic tracts and also Paramahansa Yogananda 's The Autobiography of a Yogi . Here was genuine and compelling " Fascination " of an eternal sort , complete with miracles of faith , and yet I could not yield to it ; it simply was not to be yielded to , not to be believed-not somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus or God . Even if you did not " believe " in them . I read the book as if it were a novel by Dostoevsky , and again I found myself enthralled by completely new ideals , but again I found that , as when I was under the Russian 's spell , I could not bridge the distance between Yogananda 's ideals , and his counter-Christian miracles , on one side , and on the other , the world into which I woke each morning-there was Daddy , still himself , still cooking us his heavy pancakes , still worried about this and that , not seeming to know how to be helpful , absenting himself . There was Mother , the intrusive familial superego . There were the classrooms , where although we liked our new young physics teacher , we played practical jokes on him , even though or because he had tried to befriend us by telling us , while we worked on equations of electromagnetism , about Jean-Paul Sartre and existentialism , to which he passionately devoted himself ; there were the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there were the fields beyond our house into which , when I was much younger , I had gone before doing my homework or after , as long as I could be back by dinner time , the signal for which Mother had given standing on the front porch : a phrase that in all the neighborhood of calling mothers was hers alone , as she either sang in a hooting way that sound of hers-her o-or whistled it . Eight quick high repeated notes on the same **26;1768;TOOLONG a glissando from that one to a held pitch a minor third below it-two eighth-notes . Minor but not melancholy-instead positive , urgent . Why did I not hear it as a minor third , but as the top two notes of a major triad ? In solfeggio , it would have been not a minor-key mi to do , but a major-key so to mi , the quick notes and the first slower note on so , then the gliss to mi-like a phrase on a violin . The phrase was so expressive that a violinist would have been envious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded major-not sad but cheerful . Not only sad but also cheerful . What did Yogananda have to do with all that ? Was it all illusion ? <p> L and I sketched a romantic fantastical musical together : he wrote the lyrics and I the music . We filled in the book with a flimsy plot and finished perhaps ten songs , and I felt no nervousness , beyond what anyone else would have felt , when in the choir rehearsal room of the high school we gave a kind of reading of it to an audience of our friends and a few teachers , helped by a favorite and lovely young English teacher with a good soprano voice ; she sang the songs to my accompaniment , alternating every few minutes with L 's recitation of the action . L and I felt elated ; we would finish the musical and take a stab at a career ! No-we would visit the nursing homes to play our schmaltzy music , because we both felt we should perform good works . Considering what we chose to play for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these , were good works in the moral rather than the aesthetic sense . I had the old , at least somewhat reliable car , and he set up the engagements . Given his new adherence to the ideas of Vedanta , his new conviction that the world was illusion-which I think made it possible for him to bear up a little less woundedly under the vile exclusions and arbitrary shamings of high-school life-it was perhaps easier for him to offer smiling false warmth , the warmth of mere pity or impersonal kindness , to the elderly strangers who either fixed us with desperate stares or seemed not even to know that we were among them , than to try to be himself among our age-mates . He took me with him a few times to visit his Baptist youth minister , who drove an old Porsche and talked philosophy . In charming me , this man also made me feel I had suffered an injustice in having been brought up in my parents ' church . Unlike any other Baptist or Methodist I had yet met , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dialectic with faith . But this was not enough for L , who was now triangulating his position with respect to the eternal by standing vedantically far to one side of Jesus . <p> L had a sly wit and liked to laugh , but sometimes this was when no one else was laughing . Even when others laughed with him , his gentle guffaw might seem a little forced . He was a small thin young man , not handsome , and more liked by teachers-who liked him very much-than by our fellow students . Temporarily assuaged or suppressed in our moments of high spirits , something in him was restive and morose , as it was in me , also . When he proselytized for Vedanta , I felt a serious , in fact pressing , need to know the extent of his own belief in it . But he would smile and dodge my questions , or answer with flat , very brief homilies the same way a fundamentalist Christian might , even if his particular homilies could not have been more different from theirs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of his putative new belief . But our friendship was far stronger than my theological irritation with him . <p> Once , in cool weather , we decided to take a short trip together , but having no money and not really much sense of adventure , and perhaps without time or parental permission to do anything more , we took my old car on a Saturday morning and drove the sixty miles to my family 's one-room camp house on the land near New Ulm that my father had bought with a Veterans Administration loan . Where I had outgrown the execution of small animals for sport . In the last light of afternoon , L fished in the small muddy artificial pond that Daddy had stocked . L caught a bass , which we cooked in a skillet over a campfire and ate . ( I teased him : was this correct behavior , or was it sin , in Vedanta ? ) In the complete absence of any other human noise but our own , and made aware , especially at nightfall , of the vegetal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the storied constellations , filled with what I think of now as unconscious hope that the stars would , for our devotion to them on this one measly night out of all our nights , confer on us some exaltation . And they did . We must have talked-because this was what we had gone there for-about Vedanta and God , human being , girls , music , truth , friends , teachers , power , money , our parents and brothers and sisters . We did not , I am sure , have any way to open up the deepest , most frightening doubt-not the doubt of God ( which left other possibilities , like existentialism ) but the doubt of meaning . Meaning in anything we knew or believed or experienced . Or that anyone did . We retired to the camp house and slept under old army blankets on my family 's two cheap aluminum cots with thin foam mattresses ; we were happy to be away from everyone else ; we were uncomfortable and woke often , happy in our sleeplessness to be out from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came not too early but late , late , to eyes already awake in separate heads full of thoughts but with silent mouths . <p> On the way home that day , my car broke down , and we , perhaps genuinely within the hippyish historical moment , performing the role of not caring , not having a schedule , existing only to be , man , sat ( L more at ease in this than I ) , on a grassy embankment that sloped up from the road , in the cool weather , and we rejected any agenda , even for getting the car fixed-waiting till someone or other might have the curiosity to stop and help . But no one did , and after a time we walked a half mile or so to the nearest house and by telephone summoned aid I could not afford . How strange it is , writing this , to realize that of those moments that seemed so much a part of Being larger than our own , when we were sitting above the passing cars , laughing from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , in the innumerable leaves of grass , in watching the people driving by as if there were someplace to go , L and I are the only ones in all the world to have a memory , since that little excursion was an event in only our two lives , his and mine . And while I am bent on remembering , on reconstructing and constructing anew , images and sentences and accounts of those events and relationships and feelings with which I half-chose to create myself , in those days , L lives now in a medicated state of mind both perturbed and erratic , and he seems to be incapable of engaging with the world or he has withdrawn from it . I see a mental image of two streams , each capable of supporting life , even if not perfectly , but which when they merged and commingled became poisonous to it-the one stream his eccentricity of feeling and attitude , whether of inborn temperament or formed by suffering , and the other the world , forever blossoming and yet forever consumed in its zones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew him into itself , and seemed to shove him deeper into himself , after we graduated from high school . By his second year in college , he had sold his violin , and he was writing no more song lyrics , but instead beginning the successive stages of either renunciation or disablement that have defined the trajectory of his life since then . He dropped out of college in order to yield to being drafted for military service-because he was convinced by his ascetic logic that he would be taken farthest in spirit by yielding to the worst possibilities of life . He survived his tour of duty in Vietnam without physical wounds . And he re-upped , and again survived in body . But evidently with a scourged spirit . Over the following years , he gave up more and more of his possibilities , unable to keep a job or unable to want to keep one . He became dependent for his survival on his elderly mother . His father , whom I seldom had seen during our high school years , had died ; I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day that L had shown to me a book of Masonic rites and credos that-his father vociferated at both of us-was to have been kept utterly secret from those not initiated . L had already been inducted as a Demolay , as the youths were called , and perhaps did not think he was prohibited from revealing to an uninitiate like me some of what he himself did not believe , or perhaps he wanted very much to reveal it illicitly because he hated the Masons but could not refuse his father 's expectation that he join ; or perhaps he wanted to undermine his father , to reduce his power , and could not do so to his scowling , yelling face . ( Such anger ! - as if the Masonic practice amounted to the ancient secret Eleusinian mysteries or the Mayan rites on which the very turning of the natural world depended . ) And as L moved farther toward the peripheries of social being , as if unable to hold his place against the whirling centrifugal motion of what is normal , what is the accepted behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begetting , among us , I could no longer recognize in him the close friend of my youth , whom I had loved and with whom I had been able to think out loud and honestly , as with no one else , about meaning . <p> Last night-by which I mean , approximately or metaphorically , just before finishing the writing of these pages-I dreamt that I was to perform the Grieg piano concerto but could not : I had been sick for days , I had not practiced , I did not know the piece well enough , I could not even remember all of it . That dream . But for the first time in my life-possibly because this writing , over several years , has brought back into my mind so many passages and passengers of time and music that only now , thought through , have given me some of their meaning-this dream of anxiety about performing had a different ending . Suddenly realizing that for weeks I had not been showing up to teach a class , that I was supposed to have sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on opening night I was standing in the wing about to be shoved onstage to speak my lines in a play I had never memorized or rehearsed , that I was at the keyboard with a full house watching and could not remember the sonata : I have often and acutely lived all those moments while asleep in body and painfully aware in dream . But this time I entered an elegant room in which six or seven persons in evening clothes were sitting at a low table-evidently those who had arranged my performance of Grieg ( a proper name spelled very like the word " grief " ) - and I told them I was canceling . " What ? You ca n't ! " they cried out , looking up from their tea sandwiches and cups of Earl Grey . Instantly they had become extremely agitated . " Yes . I can , " I said , and finally I removed myself-at least in the counter-realm of dreamed wishes , fears , and desires-from experiencing again the excruciating anxiety of that moment of annihilating exposure to the expectations of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided . <p> Not because the band director liked me or especially respected my ability , but perhaps only because he liked my piano teacher , Mrs. H , or because he wanted more of her excellent transcriptions of orchestral music for his band , he yielded to her suggestion that at the next symphonic band concert , in the capacious school auditorium , when I would be a graduating high-school senior , I leave my place as the second-chair clarinetist and play a brief piano concerto with the accompaniment of the band-she would transcribe the work and produce the parts . Not only the director yielded , but I did also . Much against my instincts and wishes . Sheepishly I told Mrs. H that I did not want to perform the piece , that I was afraid I would not be able to play it well , that I did not seek the glory of the soloist . Cheerfully she insisted that I could and would play well . <p> The work was Ernest Bloch 's Scherzo Fantasque for piano and orchestra-a somewhat obscure twentieth-century piece , scarcely ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbers and seems to struggle to voice something that can not be voiced . In performance , it lasts nine densely eventful minutes : a mini-concerto-perfectly suitable in length , even though musically it was not well calculated for our audience , who were not likely ever to have heard anything of this sort . At rehearsal , after months of my preparation , the band director was not helpful . I think he liked having to turn to me when he raised his baton , to go through the little ritual of awaiting the soloist 's exact moment of readiness , because this subordination of himself to me , a boy , gave him something new to be nettled by . <p> Although I was too ignorant even to have heard of Bloch until Mrs. H showed me the score , and she could not have known anything about Mother 's family , the piece was like a fateful , secret call that only my unconscious heard . ( But all that , in my family , was always another story-or rather the other story . ) Bloch had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jewish texts ; he had toured America when young , then had returned here in 1939 to stay , far from both murderous Germany and its supposedly neutral but in fact very accommodating neighbor , his native Switzerland . During World War II , he could not or did not compose . He wrote the Scherzo in 1948-it was a year younger than I. Despite my acute stage fright , which was like a loss of some of my identity , I had already played and placed ; I had never won , in those competitions , and I was far more anxious , anticipating my performance of the Scherzo , than I had been before competitions . ( The only competition I ever enjoyed was in composition ; there I played my own piece at the winners ' recital-not nearly as nervous , because I had not written music too hard for me to play securely . ) <p> When you flinch at something unpleasant , you close your eyes ; there is also a way of closing the ears . Not physically , of course , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you play badly , that is too difficult , that you are faking a little . So you do n't hear the sound you have made because you do not want , or can not bear , to hear it ; instead , if you hear anything at all , it is the sound that you would like to have made . Even if I had had a much better ear than I did and do have , the Bloch was not easy for me to hear . It consists of the piano 's numerous entrances in the rapid opening and closing sections , in dialogue with the orchestra ( in my case , band ) , and a slow , somewhat melodic section in the middle . Musicians " attack " their entrances . Performance requires unerring deliberateness , which is not necessarily spoiled , at the piano , at least , by an occasional missed note . The musician attacks with flair and precision but also , ideally , with freedom . Freedom to feel , to play without technical limitations , to be caught up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music more freshly than ever before . Music has to be accomplished to perfection in the moment , in the rapidly passing instant ; one try , after countless preparatory tries during the hours of practice and then rehearsal . But this is not possible for me-I need to reach such perfection as I can gradually , building it up by increments of rethinking and of feeling again , feeling more and more deeply , as I can only do when writing or rather when rewriting . And you have to be completely inside the music , for the full duration of the performance , but my mind is constantly scattering itself like beams of light reflected off flying fragments of what was supposed to be whole . Or my thoughts run off in several directions at once to follow hints , paths of implication , in fleeting half-glimpsing pursuit of what I do not quite yet know . Musical performance can be , and even must be , at least somewhat spontaneous , but it is not a moment for becoming distracted by new possibilities , as if suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed it . And I had butterflies . <p> Even though I did not possess exceptional technique , my youthful strength and stamina were to my advantage-two years before , when I was sixteen , at the piano I had provided all of the rehearsal music for the first musical to be presented at my high school , The Boy Friend , and I had played as loud as I could during performances to avoid being drowned out by my sidemen on drums and saxophone . I sat nearly unseen in the pit , and I pushed the dull sound of an old upright piano up across the stage and out to the audience , to get the simple , superficial music moving , to get the feeling out to everyone . From playing so much , I was covering my fingertips with Band-Aids , and still a little blood seeped onto the keys . Which only added to my sense of triumph as we brought the curtain down on each enthusiastically applauded performance . When I accompanied friends who played flute or oboe or clarinet in competitions , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose role was to help each of them give a good performance before judges not listening primarily to me . On the evening of the Scherzo , the musical expectations I faced-the director 's , my teacher 's , my own , Bloch's-were far higher . <p> At recitals , I wore my formal white evening jacket , which made me an unwitting dim visual echo of my dead Uncle Vitaly in his white tie and tails , forty years earlier . For the Scherzo I wore my heavy dark blue band uniform . The director insisted that a soloist who was also a member of the band was not exempt from wearing what everyone else was wearing , since to allow otherwise would be to encourage those " prima donna " illusions that he was always too eager to see and then crush in his meek students . I rose from my second chair among the clarinets and , dazed by the moment , took my seat at the grand piano . My paralyzing nervousness , an old unwelcome friend , did not fail me . I stormed or crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like drunks along the uneven white-and-black pavement . The playing is mostly in the body . Where are we going ? the ringers ask , quivering . They miss notes they never missed when they were practicing . Fingers without strength , almost without feeling . Bewildered , disoriented . <p> I took my unearned bows to the puzzled , fading applause . After the concert , I said to Mrs. H when she passed me , " I told you ! " She said nothing to me . I was in a very agitated state , distracted , ashamed of myself , angry . At myself , for having failed to play well and for having been false to myself when I had agreed to perform ; at her for having pushed me to go on . <p> My mother 's side-the music-making , the unconventional and Old World attitudes , the Jewish legacy of study-did not give me any ambition to become an artist ; but on the other hand , and this was perhaps as much as any such influence could do in that time and place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought that people who were professional musicians ( four of Mother 's brothers and her sister Anna , too ) , alive and dead , were suspicious characters or unseemly or unworthy of respect . Uncle Joe might be extremely unpleasant , but not because he was a musician . Some of the European bourgeois attitudes , for good ( art and music are nice ) rather than for ill ( artists and musicians are not quite nice ) , were translated or transposed into the attitudes of my mother 's family in the New World . And in the years after my public debacle at the keyboard , I continued to practice that part of myself that wanted to reach with a gesture of expressiveness toward the world , but with words rather than with notes . <p> We say that language , and certainly poetic language , can be sometimes " musical , " and in addition to the sheer sound of language as poetry measures it out , breath by breath , vowel by vowel , in syllables stressed and unstressed , in rhythms of infinite variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestrations of meanings that sound all at once , like several notes of one chord . I love poetry partly because-despite its being sometimes used , as music is used , merely as distraction and entertainment , even for the powerful or the cruel-its living presence , in text and human voice , can always be one form of resisting the way that thought and feeling have been conditioned to run obediently . When we are urged and instructed and coerced to think only one thought , language has a way of offering several . It resists . Or slips out of the trap . A poem can perform or preserve a complicated feeling that can not be easily summarized , and for which there is no other name but the whole poem . ( Why should there not be , in theory , fully as many feelings distinct from each other , even if only subtly , as those innumerably different colors that we collapse into a few names ? ) Also , there is some meaning in words that the language opens up only or especially while holding hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space or sanctuary for the voice that must say what must not be said-no matter how unpleasant or joyous or sorrowful or accusing or praising or practically useless the utterance , the poem , may be . Poetry preserves echoes of what was once said but can not now be easily heard , in such various forms as Scottish ballads or odes of John Keats or coruscating verses of Cesar Vallejo or fluid talky Brazilian song lyrics or Choctaw legends of gods and spirits or Sappho 's love poems or Paul Celan 's small heavy nuggets of anguish . To be sure , poetry 's preservations and reenactments sometimes include attitudes , acquiescences , habits of feeling , that are mean , inhumane , hateful , too , webbed in seductive movements of language and inextricable from the pleasures of those movements . The complexity of feeling runs against the simplifications of evil and callousness , of indifference and dullness , of political manipulation and hypocrisy , so poetry tends to articulate more truly than other modes of communication . And although the poetic and rhetorical tricks of advertising corrupt our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived experience false , poems can at best restore an old or create a new honesty-even if , at worst , they too lie . <p> When I was between my junior and senior years in college , teaching for the summer in a poor school in Trenton , in 1968 ; or between writing papers and working ; or between tutoring immigrant kids who were nearly defenseless against the false ideals of American mass culture-who had been born unlucky and who kept making unlucky choices-and listening to Stravinsky , Bartok , Beethoven , the Beatles , and the Stones ; between being in love and wondering how not to become a U.S. soldier ( like L , who had chosen it ! ) while in Vietnam the wrong war was igniting its avalanches of chemical fire and everyone was liable to execute everyone ; between avidly absorbing the turns of thought in lectures and seminars and books and decoding the social force fields of the American aristocracy and meritocracy around me-I wrote a poem . Draft after draft , the process , in itself , revealed much to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonetheless being taught-but by whom or what ? By our language , by the poems in all our languages , by new affiliations with other persons and other worlds , by the contradictions of being given an education to perform a role that sometimes shamed me , by the impulse to listen to what ideals , ideologies , and sentences truly sound like , by the movement in all of us of the unconscious . A very young man in love , I had abruptly understood , and was disturbed to understand , that my loving could be a constraint on the young woman whom I loved . The shock of my own insight compelled me to try to write the poem , which on the one hand was an expression of passion and disillusionment contradicting each other , and on the other a structure of symmetries . The poem made a certain small sound in the late-night silences , and even amidst the noise of midday . No one had offered to pay me for it . No one but that young woman might see it . And she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as a gesture . Yet in the writing itself , especially at the end of the process , there was a kind of fullness , of momentary sufficiency , of freedom . A performance on the stage of language . But without fright , and not with the sensation of carrying the music , but with the exhilaration of being carried-by adrenalin and by the possibilities of language itself . It was not like being the performer , but like being the music . <p>
