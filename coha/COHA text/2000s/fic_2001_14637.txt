Once , at the beginning of time , the three Fates , unpleasant young girls , enacted the story that was to become that of Antigone . The three girls played all the parts with hats instead of masks , and a whole rack of customary costumery . A battle field . Heaps of dead clothing . Dead clothing strewn all over . Three girls watch from a distance . Unknown god as a bodiless shadow approaches . As a swirl of fabric . I am the Shriek Operator . ! . I am the unique situation . I am the uncanny and have come to this place , place crowded with corpses and the stench of death . I am the Shriek Operator and am very pleased with all this slaughter , this horror , this misfortune . Misfortune out of contrast , sprung hinges , what creaks , what is fundamentally broken . Sand pours without anyone willing it . Pours from above . From the sky . Something is covered . Something mangled and horribly dead . Pours . Horripilation . Who . Who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter of a man whose name . The one of whom it is said , he possessed one eye too many . Saw too much . learned too little from what he saw . Incurious . Curious , how incurious . Mind made up . Driven from place to place by ! . The Shriek Operator . The shorthand for " there exists a unique situation " . The shorthand that stands in total contradistinction to the shorthand for " it will always be that " . Shorthand for " it always was that " . @x Pause . A small unpleasant animal crosses the vast emptiness of infinite spaces . They watch this . Not a very nice animal , in fact . Silence . We behold , for the first time the curvature of the earth . Someone looks out and holds an egg . If X , then Y. Logic , someone says . A song : Thus it will always be/ thus it will always be/ thus it will always be ; / kettle , kettle , kettle , / boil up a fragrant tea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anniversary of me. / The fatal anniversary of me. // Looks around , shivering and afraid . Look at her ( this is a command ) . Alone and cold . No one to love her . No one to protect her . Nothing but stillness . Stillness laying waste . The laying waste of stillness . Now she is the focal point of stillness . And and and and the gods are coming . Unknown ones and the unseen . Collision of the necessary and insoluble in her girl 's face . Each FACT denies another . All change hats . Nothing works . Nothing works , and the Rock emerges from the gloom . Castle Rock . In the middle of air . High above us . What is closed begins to open . Something catches us by surprise . It is Haemon , falling upon his sword , as is the tragic fashion . We hear his death agony . Slow way to die . Time passes unconcerned . His death is horrible . We watch him from a distance ( this is a command ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We feel cold and alone . Antigone looks at us . We look at Antigone . Nothing moves us . Nothing moves Antigone . This is the cat's-cradle . We feel nothing because we are no longer what 's called " human " . A song : The devil wipes his tail with Creon 's pride. / Listen to Little Jack fry up an eyeball for an egg. / Bubba tubba bubba tubba bubba tubba bup. // I am the kind of girl tired of always being wise. / I am the tin can tied to my own damn tail. // Fry up an eyeball for an egg/ Leg up , leg down , leg up , leg down/ Egg , egg , egg , egg , stupid old egg// Oedipus , he had one eye too many perhaps// . Quietly , one of the three : I am the tin can tied to my own damn tail . Slow fade to black in which we hear them sing the song over again till they get it right . More right . Over and over . Silence Pause . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withered bough . Crow having a hard time cleaning her wing . Silence. @x Once , at the beginning of time , the Three Fates , young girls then , enacted the story that was to become that of Antigone .
