He was a Wall Street upstart from Brooklyn 50 years ago . Since then , Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill got rich and famous building an empire that culminated with the Travelers-Citicorp merger in 1998 . In the process he walked away once and busted up with friends like Jamie Dimon . Weill , 73 , has written The Real Deal , on his dealmaking and how things could have gone smoother . He spoke with TIME 's BILL SAPORITO about mending fences , how to keep marriages strong and his focus on philanthropy . <P> There 's been a lot written about you . Is this new book a chance to even the score ? <P> Over time , I 've rationalized what happened in a lot of different events , and it turned out , in my rationalization , that most of the time I was right . I knew that that was never the case , so I went and got a collaborator who was very well briefed and knowledgeable about the banking and financial world  --  the No. 1 analyst at Merrill Lynch  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . These were people whom I was mentoring like Shearson 's Peter Cohen or Citigroup 's Jamie Dimon ; or John Reed , after we did our merger . One of the interesting things in spending two years working on a book is that it is a little cathartic . People whom I had grudges about  --  I felt that it 's enough time and life is too short . Most of these people have been successful in other careers , and that 's a good thing . Maybe it 's time to renew our friendship . <P> So have you learned a better way to part with people or fire them ? <P> I 've never been very good at firing people . I 've been always very loyal to people , and loyal to a fault when somebody was starting to do the wrong things . I just let those people be in the company way too long , until the problem became bigger . I always liked somebody else to do the actual firing or letting go or having that difficult conversation , which I was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually did do it myself was when John Reed , his co-CEO at Citi and I decided to tell Jamie Dimon , a Citi president and his longtime protg that this was not working out . I felt that I had enough of a relationship with Jamie that I should be the one who tells him , which I did . But it was not easy . <P> The Citicorp and Travelers Group merger worked financially , but there were problems with top management and between you and John Reed . What happened ? <P> People have different strengths and weaknesses , and my strength was not the ability to confront people . My strength was much more in the ability to evaluate where business was going , and getting it to grow by encouraging all the people in the company to make the decision pretty fast about who should stay and who should go . Because when you do n't make those decisions , nobody knows better that you 're not making the sensible decision fast enough than the people who are working in the company . <P> Has Citigroup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being too big , is my personal point of view . Our market share in a lot of the growth markets for financial services around the world may be 3% or 4% . It can be a multiple of that . <P> You 're a numbers guy , but you used to pal around with Johnny Carson and Muhammad Ali . <P> When I got married 51 years ago , I was a very shy person and my wife was more outgoing . She used to push me at night to make the sales calls , to speak to people  --  The kids got ta eat .
