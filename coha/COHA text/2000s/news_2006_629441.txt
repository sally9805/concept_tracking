<p> CHEFS can be the toughest restaurant critics - especially when they 're choosing where to wine and dine their dates . <p> After all , their reputations are on the line . They should know all about food , right ? <p> Surprisingly , most chefs do n't go for fancy , big-ticket restaurants , at least not on the first date . Too predictable , they say . They prefer offbeat restaurants . <p> " You do n't want a restaurant that everybody knows , " Ibiza chef-owner Charles Clark says . " You know her friends will ask , So , where did Charles take you ? ' The way to impress them is by taking your date somewhere they do n't know about . " <p> Clark and his counterparts also like the chef to be in the kitchen , cooking . <p> Soft lighting , an intimate setting and nice music are important . Ultimately , however , the food matters most . <p> " Romance does n't happen without good food , " caterer Jackson Hicks says . <p> So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chefs ' choices for food and romance . <p> On their first date , Clark took his wife to La Vista Pizzeria &; Italian Cuisine . <p> " The reason is , I could bring my own wine , " he says . " It 's the kind of place where you could be drinking a $100 wine bottle with bruschetta and mussels while sitting on plastic chairs . It 's fun . It 's casual . And if the girl gets it , then you know she 's the one . " <p> Completely smitten , Clark chose Fuad 's Continental Restaurant for the second date . <p> " There 's no menu , " he says , " and it has a Parisian feel to it . " <p> Fuad 's is dark and intimate . Chef Joseph Mashkoori also serves " killer " garlic-butter escargots and a classic steak Diane , Clark says . <p> Privacy is important for conversations . <p> " Big , private booths are nice , especially for romantic dinners , " Abuso Catering Co. chef-owner Joe Abuso says . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> His pick ? <p> The plush tan leather booths at Caf Le Jadeite . <p> For dinner beneath the stars , the caterer takes his wife to Laurier Caf &; Wine . <p> " In the evening , with the lights on , the patio is very romantic , " he says . " The tables are not too close together , so you can have a conversation without being overheard . " <p> Abuso is also keen on the restaurant 's reasonably priced wines . <p> " It 's one of my favorite wine lists in town , " he says . <p> " Instead of spending a fortune on a Bordeaux or cabernet , they 'll have whites from the Loire Valley and reds from Rhne Valley , lesser known regions that make great wines , " he says . " Rather than spending $200 , it 's more like $35-$40 for a really good bottle . " <p> Trevsio chef Bonner Cameron spent months planning for the " big night . " He chose Mockingbird Bistro , a place his girlfriend had never been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant to put on the table that evening , " he recalls . " During the fourth course , I gave her a card that told her about our past , present and future . " <p> Then he got down on his knees and popped the question . <p> " I was so nervous , I ca n't remember what we ate that evening , " he says . " But I picked it because I like John Sheely 's food . It 's got really good , robust flavors . " <p> Matt Maroni was too nervous to eat on his big night . Instead , the Rainbow Lodge chef took girlfriend Melina Lombard to the Tasting Room in Uptown Park for wine and cheese . <p> " It was New Year 's Eve , " he says . " I knew the restaurants would be busy . I 'm a shy kid , but I 'm also a traditionalist . I wanted to get down on my knees , but not in front of a large crowd . " <p> With two young children , romantic dinners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But he and his wife occasionally spend time alone over a plate of fresh , inventive sushi at Sakana Japanese Grill &; Sushi Bar . <p> " You 're not going to get the boring California roll you find everywhere else , " he says . " You can ( have it ) if you want it , but I usually ask the chef to do a sushi tasting . He 's amazing , incredibly creative . " <p> A recent discovery is Sage 400 Japanese Cuisine , a restaurant in the Galleria . <p> " My wife is very particular about the crazy tuna roll , " he says . " Most places will make it with all rice and little tuna . Not here - you get a good amount of spicy tuna . " <p> Joseph 's pick for a cheap , casual date is the Old Place Cafe , a Chinese dumpling house in Sugar Land . With homemade red picnic tables and stools , it is unique and laid-back . <p> " It 's very authentic Chinese , " he says . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable soup and dumplings . That 's it . But the pan-fried pork dumplings are the best I 've ever eaten . The chef makes all his pasta . " <p> Alden Houston Hotel 's 17 Restaurant chef Ryan Pera has a soft spot for Caf Rabelais in Rice Village . <p> " I lived in Paris , so this is a little reminiscent of that , " he says . " It 's also hard to go wrong with the mussels . They 're plump and juicy , cooked in a light cream sauce . " <p> Pera also likes the cafe 's wine list . <p> " It 's all French wines . You do n't see that all the time , " he says . " And you do n't find the ' 99 French red Burgundies from Cte d'Or often , either . It 's fruity and balanced , a good year . " <p> Hicks advises avoiding popular restaurants on Fridays and Saturdays . His favorite place to take a date is Da Marco . <p> " But I prefer dining there midweek because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for recommendations , Hicks sends them to either Antica Osteria or Divino Italian Restaurant &; Wine Bar . <p> " Antica 's interior is romantic , " he says . " The meals are good . I love the beef carpaccio , and the pasta dishes are consistent . <p> " As for Divino , it 's not expensive and you 're not going to be overwhelmed by a 40-page wine list , " he says . " It also has the best fried calamari in the city . Just tell them to do it a little on the crispy side . " <p> When Kiran 's chef-owner Kiran Verma is n't dining at No or t'afia , she 's at the Rainbow Lodge . <p> " The setting is beautiful , with acres and acres of greenery , " she says . <p> " It makes you feel far away from the hustle and bustle . I 'm reminded of the foothills of the Himalayas in north India . " <p> While they were dating , executive chef Jonathan Jones of the Tasting Room took his wife to Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " It has n't been overly Westernized . The decor is very ' 80s , with the booths , gold trim and lots of red . <p> " My wife always gets the moo goo gai pan with the brown sauce . I get the won ton soup and egg rolls . They have the perfect egg roll - that 's the real testament of a good Chinese restaurant . " <p> For sushi , Gravitas partner-chef Jason Gould visits Osaka Japanese Restaurant . For fajitas , it 's El Tiempo Cantina . But for some old-fashioned American Italian and chicken Parme- san , he takes girlfriend Rebekah Hubbard to Michelangelo 's . <p> " But the truth is , one of the things that chefs suffer for is that we 're always working when our wives ( and girlfriends ) are at home , waiting for us , " he says . " Any restaurant is romantic as long as I 'm ( there ) with my girlfriend .
