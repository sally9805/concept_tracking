<p> Nashville  --  Poor Carmack . <p> He 's standing in the Tennessee sunlight this crisp spring morning , a Civil War-era frock coat frozen down to his knees , one bronze hand pointed like an accusing prosecutor , a set of sculpted eyes permanently fixed on the horizon of his beloved city . Though his legacy is lost to history  --  there 's not even a first name on this statue here at the Tennessee State Capitol building  --  the 19th century gentleman 's flowery words are forever carved into the granite beneath his feet : " Let me be pillowed upon the tender bosom of my beloved South forever . " <p> Be careful what you wish for . <p> Standing on this hill alongside Carmack , on the windy government plaza overlooking downtown Nashville , I have been reflecting on how much this city has changed since I was a schoolgirl in the ' 60s lining up single file on class trips at this very spot . Those were the only times I recall ever doing much walking downtown . By then , Nashville had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became infatuated with long ranch houses in the suburbs and even longer shopping centers . <p> But I 've walked all morning in the once-seedy heart of the city  --  through the polished glass revolving doors at the sleek Hilton Hotel , past the trendy Palm Restaurant , up brand-new sidewalks with construction workers on nearly every corner . A flashing sign at the blue-steel Gaylord Entertainment Center hawks a hockey game by the popular Nashville Predators . The Ryman Auditorium , historic home of the Grand Ole Opry , has quite a different name from the country greats of yore on the marquee today : Gladys Knight . I walk past espresso shops , nail boutiques , lunch-hour restaurants with sidewalk tables , even an art gallery featuring a photo exhibit by legendary Time-Life photographer Ed Clark . ( In homage to the past , I buy a print of shirt-sleeved fans standing in line outside the Opry , circa 1947 ) . <p> The changes in Nashville 's streetscapes and skyline only hint at the major shift in perspective that has taken place in the past decade . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , movers and shakers in the community , to jot down their thoughts on how to make the city a better place . He took those ideas and created " Nashville 's Agenda , " 21 goals for the 21st century . They included a new visual arts center , major sports teams , preservation of the Cumberland River ( the main waterway through downtown ) , world-class accommodations , and a city with a " vibrant , 24-hour downtown that is safe and attractive . " From the vantage point of a native who 's an occasional visitor , it appears Nashville rallied . <p> Part of me misses the heavy scent and quiet intractability of the Old South to which Carmack pledged his allegiance . You can still find remnants of it , if you look hard enough  --  the Opry , a cold beer at Tootsie 's Orchid Lounge , the Belle Meade Cafeteria with its creamed-chicken-on-corn bread . But exploring this New Nashville can be fun , too . Here 's a quick road map . <p> Frist Center for the Visual Arts <p> In the 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population center ( 1,231,311 residents ) in Tennessee . But in spite of the growth ( and subsequent demand for more cultural offerings ) , the city has never had a major league visual arts museum . Until now . <p> Opened on April 8 , the Frist Center for the Visual Arts is a 125,000-square-foot facility housed in what used to be the downtown post office at 919 Broadway , right next door to the Romanesque train depot , Union Station ( which was restored in 1990 as an upscale hotel ) . <p> The Frist is worth a visit for two reasons . It boasts 24,000 square feet of bright , glass-and-marble gallery space offering world-class art . ( As a comparison , Atlanta 's High Museum of Art is 40,000 square feet . ) On view through July 8 is " European Masterworks : Paintings from the Art Gallery of Ontario , " a collection of " oh-wow " paintings representing 500 years of Europe 's best  --  Rembrandt 's " Portrait of a Lady With a Lap Dog , " Picasso 's " Seated Woman " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the building itself is also a visual treat . Built in 1933-34 , the structure is a Hollywood art director 's dream , a tantalizing blend of classicism and art deco styles . The marble lobby  --  where Nashvillians used to line up to mail tax returns on deadline , check their brass post office boxes or mail letters to loved ones before hopping a train next door  --  has been restored to its Depression-era glory . Most striking are the silver medallions that ring the upper border of the walls : bas-reliefs of planes , trains , automobiles . Most Nashvillians who walk into the new facility tend to gawk upward as if they had never seen it before . In fact , most have n't . Until the restoration , the whole thing had been covered with turquoise paint . 10 a.m. - 5:30 p.m . Mondays-Saturdays ( until 8 p.m . Thursdays ) , 1-5 p.m . Sundays . Admission : $6.50 , $4.50 for seniors and college students with ID . Children 18 and under are admitted free . For information on current exhibits , call 615-244-3340 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fame and Museum <p> The " new " Nashville has n't forgotten its past . It 's simply been made over and moved uptown . <p> On Thursday , the doors will open on the $37 million Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum , a slick , state-of-the-art facility that will be to country music what the Smithsonian is to American history . The 40,000-square-foot museum , designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates , the firm that created Washington 's Holocaust Museum , takes visitors through a chronological history of the sounds that put Nashville on the map . There are multimedia displays , informational kiosks , live performances , movie theaters and artifacts under glass that help even guests unfamiliar with the genre understand why country music is so important to this city and American culture . <p> You can see the weathered guitar on which Mother Maybelle Carter plucked out " Wildwood Flower , " Webb Pierce 's embroidered Nudie suit ( stitched with handcuffs and a jailhouse ) , the office where producer Owen Bradley pitched songs to artists such as Loretta Lynn , and Hank Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeves . <p> But more important than the exhibits is the care planners have taken with the historical presentation . Unlike the sweetly kitschy old Hall of Fame , which was essentially a souvenir shop with a mish-mash of artifacts designed for gawking , this undertaking is ambitious in its scope and wealth of information presented . The architectural design , by Seab Tuck of Tuck Hinton &; Associates , is also stunning . The three-story structure sweeps across the downtown landscape like the fin of a giant Cadillac , with windows designed to evoke the notes of a piano dotting the facade . To the left : a lighted radio tower that recalls the original WSM radio broadcast beacon that beamed the Grand Ole Opry to Depression-era fans throughout the South . <p> The museum saves the best for last : Elevators open into a rotunda that houses the plaques of the members of the Hall of Fame  --  a country version of the Jefferson Memorial . Even the most jaded country fans will get chills when they look up and see the words encircling the wall : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Carter Family tune that the country music community generally believes embodies the spirit of their art form . A near-holy experience . 10 a.m. -6 p.m. daily ( until 10 p.m . Thursdays ) . Admission : $14.95 ; children 6 to 15 , $7.95 ; under 6 , free .

Forget going out to the strip of chain motels on Briley Parkway , near the old Opryland site ( which was inexplicably demolished by its owners and replaced with a banal shopping mall ) . If you have the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an essential part of the new Nashville experience . <p> For sheer just-out-of-the-wrapper novelty , I would recommend the Hilton Suites Hotel at 121 4th Ave . South . This 12-story structure , with its pristine white exterior and posh modern decor , towers above the neon lights of the old honky-tonk district . The rooms are all suites , designed so that guests may walk a complete circle from the comfy living room to the king-sized bedroom to a huge bath , then back to an entry desk with teleport . Tip : Request a view looking to either the east ( Adelphia Stadium/river ) , the north ( downtown skyline ) or south ( Hall of Fame ) . <p> In the towering lobby atrium , huge banners hawking new country artists often hang from the balconies ( especially when a country music convention is in town ) . It 's also within walking distance of the new Hall of Fame , which is an easy stroll across a newly landscaped park . The Gaylord Entertainment Center is right next door , while the Ryman Auditorium is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a full breakfast ( included in your room rate ) served each morning in the lobby .

Revitalized arts-and-crafts bungalows near Hillsboro Village continue to make the small commercial strip one of the most engaging parts of town . <p> At Provence Breads and Cafe , you can sip latte out of a white china coffee cup the size of a soup bowl .
