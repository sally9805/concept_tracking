HERE 'S THE NIGHTMARE scenario : it 's Nov. 3 , the morning after the presidential election , and there is no winner . In a case of dj vu , the electoral vote is close and in dispute , and neither the Democratic nor Republican candidate will concede defeat . Both dispatch planes stuffed with lawyers to squabble over the results . But this time the jets are heading not to Florida but to Colorado , because the state has awarded five electoral votes to one contender and four to the other . <P> This story line is not farfetched . When the nation goes to the polls Nov. 2 , Coloradans will also vote on Amendment 36 . As of today , Colorado , like 47 other states and the District of Columbia , awards electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis . ( Nebraska and Maine give two votes to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district , though in practice neither has ever split its allotment . ) Amendment 36 , which would take effect immediately , would divvy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each candidate wins in the state . If 36 passes , and President George W. Bush 's slight lead in statewide polls holds on election night , the President would win five votes and John Kerry would win four . <P> Supporters of 36 argue that the proposed system would more accurately represent the will of the people . Presidential elections create the illusion that there are solid Republican and solid Democratic states . But in the 2000 race , in red Colorado , Al Gore won the support of more than 42% of the voters . Bush won 41% in blue California . If every state adopted 36 's rules , those supporters ' votes would count for something . " It could make California and New York worth a Republican effort , " says James Gimpel , an Electoral College expert at the University of Maryland . " Would n't it be nice , if you were a Democrat in Texas , to actually see a Democratic presidential candidate visit ? " The reform would also greatly reduce the chance of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2000 , many Democrats decided it was time to scrap the Electoral College . But that requires a constitutional amendment , not an easy thing to pass when swing states like the current system , which affords them a disproportionate share of the candidates ' attention . The Constitution gives state legislatures the power to decide how electors are chosen , and since 2000 , legislators in 29 states have proposed bills eliminating winner-take-all systems . Not one bill has passed . The party that dominates the statehouse usually has an edge in presidential campaigns and is thus reluctant to share the state 's electoral votes with the weaker party .
