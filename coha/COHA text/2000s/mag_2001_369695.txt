GOOD NEWS <P> APPLE A DAY No one would confuse a glass of apple juice with Pinot Noir , but apple growers would have you believe they 're the same , at least in one respect : their ability to reduce the risk of heart disease . A study funded by the apple industry suggests that 12 oz. of apple juice a day may help delay the formation of artery-clogging plaque . Reason : apple juice , like wine , is packed with powerful antioxidants known as flavonoids . The similarities stop there . <P> THE RAP ON PAP Women whose Pap smears are n't quite normal , but not abnormal either , are usually advised to do one of two things : get a follow-up Pap in six months or undergo an expensive procedure called a colposcopy , in which the cervix is closely examined and usually biopsied . Now researchers report on a third alternative . In a major study , they found that testing for the human papilloma virus in women with equivocal Paps quickly and accurately identifies which women are most likely to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the need to undergo one . <P> THE SLOW BURN By now most of us have heard that moderate alcohol consumption  --  about a drink a day  --  can lower the risk of heart disease . Now researchers say the risk is reduced even further in men who carry a gene that slows the rate at which alcohol is metabolized . The longer alcohol stays in the bloodstream , the more it can exert such beneficial effects as raising levels of good , HDL cholesterol . Who has the gene ? Mostly white guys ; 1 in 6 is thought to carry it . <P> BAD NEWS <P> SODDEN CYCLISTS Drinking and driving is dangerous enough , but a new study shows that 1 out of 3 fatally injured bicyclists had an elevated blood alcohol level . The average level was 0.18 g/dl , twice the legal limit for drivers in most states . And though inebriated riders need the most protection , only 5% of them bother to wear a helmet . What 's next , designated cyclists ? <P>  --  By Janice M. Horowitz <P> Sources : Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal of National Cancer Institute ( 2/21 ) ; New England Journal of Medicine ( 2/22 ) .
