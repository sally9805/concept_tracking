Dear Dr. Cory : What exercises should someone age eleven or twelve do this summer to lose some pounds ? Pamela Walnut , California . Dear Pamela : Swimming can keep you cool in the summer . Early-morning bike rides or walks with a friend are fun , too . Find out if you can ride your bike or walk to and from summer school . What about team sports , such as golf or tennis ? Even less active sports such as bowling can be fun and still give you some exercise . Doing something with a friend or being on a team often keeps you committed and makes an activity more fun . Have you ever tried volleyball , badminton , ice-skating ( even in summer ! ) , or dance lessons ? There are many types of dance classes , and they usually give your heart and lungs a very good workout . If you do n't like sports , you can always hoe weeds and plant flowers , a grape arbor , or trees in your garden or yard . Also , make wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your portion size . Listen to your body cues and stop eating when you are full . We also hope that you are limiting your " screen time " ( TV , video game , computer time ) to less than two hours a day . // Dear Dr. Cory : What are some good exercises to do when you are sore ? Amber Richburg , South Carolina Dear Amber : Stretch your muscles and try such light exercises as walking , swimming , or stationary cycling . Sore muscles need a day or two to recover , but gentle movements will help get them back to normal . Having sore muscles a day or two after exercise , called " delayed onset muscle soreness " ( DOMS for short ) , happens when muscle fibers become slightly torn . However , experts say this is normal . Once the sore muscles have recovered , they will be stronger and improve your overall fitness . DOMS usually comes from doing too much too fast , especially to muscles that are not used to a particular activity . To avoid DOMS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if you are just beginning or if you are exercising a new group of muscles . * Warm up and cool down afterwards . * Keep active . By keeping your muscles strong , they wo n't get sore as easily . Check with your doctor or nurse if your soreness keeps you from your daily activities . // Sincerely , Cory SerVaas , M.D. Sidebar Send your health questions to : " Ask Doctor Cory " Child Me P.O.
