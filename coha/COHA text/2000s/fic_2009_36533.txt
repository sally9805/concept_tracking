Two Crimes <p> It has been argued by those who have so far flattered my attempts to chronicle the life and career of Mr. Sherlock Holmesas to approach them in a scholarly manner that I have often been remiss in the arena of precise chronology . While nodding to kindly meant excuses made for me in regards to hasty handwriting or careless literary agents , I must begin by confessing that my errors , however egregious , were entirely intentional . Holmes ' s insistence , not to mention my own natural discretion , often prevented me from maintaining that exactitude so highly prized in a biographer ; I have been forced to change the dates of marginal cases to disguise great ones , alter names and circumstances , all the while diligently preserving the core truth of the events , without which there would have been no object in writing anything at all . In this instance , however , any obfuscation would be absurd , as the facts are known not only to the people of London but to the world . I shall therefore set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , omitting nothing that pertains to the most harrowing series of crimes my illustrious friend and I were ever called upon to solve . <p> The year of 1888 had already proven significant for Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for it was in that twelvemonth that he performed valuable services for one of the reigning houses of Europe and continued forestalling the activities of Professor James Moriarty , whose hold over London 's underworld grew ever more apparent to my friend . Several highly publicized investigations that year displayed Holmes ' s remarkable skills to the public , including the appalling affair of the faulty oil lamp , and the matter of Mrs. Victoria Mendosa 's mysteriously vanishing thimble and its consequences . My friend 's talents , which had once languished in obscure specialism , in that year flamed into the most gratifying notoriety . <p> Despite the busyness that accompanied Holmes 's ever-increasing reputation for omniscience , we found ourselves at home on that evening in early August , the day after Bank Holiday , Holmesperforming chemical analyses of an American snake venom which had recently proven itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perusal of the day 's papers . To my delight , the skies above the buildings burned with that most elusive of all elements , the London sun , and a brisk breeze fluttered about the windows ( one of which I 'd opened as a safeguard against Holmes ' s chemical efforts ) , when an item in the late edition of the Star caught my eye . <p> " I can not begin to understand , " I said to no one in particular , " what could drive a murderer to such total desecration of the human body . " <p> Holmes , without looking up from his work , remarked , " An argument could be made that the ultimate desecration of the human body is to end its earthly usefulness , which would imply that all murderers share equally that specific charge . " <p> " This is rather beyond the pale . It states here that some poor woman , as yet unidentified , was found stabbed to death in Whitechapel . " <p> " A deplorable , though hardly baffling occurrence . I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daily shelter . Such pitiable unfortunates are particularly likely to inspire crimes of passion in the men with whom they associate . " <p> " She was stabbed twenty times , Holmes . " <p> " And your unassailable medical assessment is that once would have been enough . " <p> " Well , yes , " I faltered . " Apparently the villain continued to slash at her long after she was dead , or so the pattern of blood indicates . " <p> The detective smiled . " You are a gentleman of the most sympathetic character , my dear Watson . While you would possibly  --  for I have seen you do it  --  condone a crime of passion committed in the throes of despair or of vengeance , you can see nothing permissible about such morbid abuse . " <p> " I suppose that expresses it . " <p> " I confess I can not imagine myself in such a rage as to batter my victim beyond all sense either , " he admitted . " Is there anything further ? " <p> " The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside his scientific materials . " Would you and I had the power to make all of London safe , my good man , but for the moment , let us leave our musings upon the depths to which our fellow citizens can sink and instead explore whether or not we have time to make a seven-thirty curtain for Brahms 's Symphony No. 4 in E Minor at the Royal Albert Hall . My attention was directed to the second-chair cellist by my brother Mycroft , and I should be grateful for your company while I observe the gentleman in his natural habitat . " <p> It took Sherlock Holmesexactlyfive days to complete the affair ofthe second cellist , and once concluded , my friend had the thanks ofthe premier branches of the British government , of which his brotherMycroft was a pivotal member . My own knowledge of MycroftHolmes 's exalted occupation was at that time a closely kept secret , for he occasionally engaged his brother upon nationally vital inquiries about which neither Sherlock Holmes nor I ought to have had the slightest inkling . I regret to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrongdoing took place in the following weeks , my friend lapsed into that melancholy torpor which made my own life , not to mention that of our landlady , Mrs. Hudson , taxing in the extreme . Holmesever maintained the opinion that we should abandon him entirely when such a fit was upon him , but as a medical man , I dreaded the sight of his tiny , impeccably kept hypodermic syringe and that momentous stop at the chemist 's which promised that my friend would commence to ruin himself for a matter of days or weeks if I did not take any steps to circumvent him . In vain I scanned the papers , and in vain I attempted to convince Holmesthat a woman ought not to be stabbed so very many times , Whitechapel or no . At length I found myself longing , fleetingly and against the dictates of my conscience , for the advent of some sensational misfortune . <p> I rose early that fateful Saturday , the morning of September the first , and as I sat smoking a pipe after breakfast , Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of reading the Daily News . The warmth of his pale complexion announced he had been out , and I noted with relief that his keen gaze betrayed no glimmer of the drug I had come to despise . His chiseled brow furrowed in concentration , he laid the open paper on our dining table and within moments had opened seven or eight other editions to which we subscribed , quickly locating the same story in each and then draping the paper over an article of furniture . <p> " Good morning , Holmes , " I remarked , just as our sitting room seemed in danger of disappearing under the crackling storm of newsprint . <p> " I 've been out , " he replied . <p> " Yes , " I returned dryly . <p> " I hope you have already broken your fast this morning , Watson . " <p> " Whatever do you mean ? " <p> " It appears that the defilement of corpses is a growing industry in Whitechapel . They 've found another one , my dear fellow . Abdomen apparently slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death , then ? " <p> " Her neck was nearly severed . " <p> " Good heavens . Where was she found ? " <p> " In Buck 's Row , it seems , which arrested my interest immediately . I imagined the other matter a bizarre aberration , but here is another on its heels . " <p> " The first was bad enough . " <p> " That girl 's name was Martha Tabram , and the early report had it wrong : she was stabbed a grand total of thirty-nine times , " he stated dispassionately . " Yesterday morning 's victim , whose name was apparently Mary Ann Nichols , by all accounts was partially eviscerated . " <p> " Dare I hope you shall look into the matter ? " I asked . <p> " It is hardly within my purview to do so when no one has consul  --  " <p> At that moment , Mrs. Hudson entered and surveyed our newly adorned furnishings with silent cynicism . Our landlady was not in the best of spirits , for Holmes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical elements over his burner , and the disagreement this activity had caused had not yet resolved itself to her satisfaction . <p> " Gentlemen to see you , " she said from the doorway . " Inspector Lestrade and one other . Will you be requiring aught from my cupboards , Mr. Holmes , or have you everything you need ? " <p> " Ha ! " Holmes exclaimed . " Lestrade occasionally evinces the most impeccable timing . Indeed no , Mrs. Hudson , I 've sufficient cutlery for my purposes . I shall ring if I want anything in the way of a pickle fork . Do show up the inspector , if you will . " <p> With studied dignity , Mrs. Hudson exited . A few moments later Inspector Lestrade and an associate entered the room . Holmesoften had occasion to bemoan the intellect of our hatchet-visaged friend , the lean and dapper little inspector , but Lestrade 's diligence commanded our respect even when his utter lack of imagination strained the independent investigator 's nerves . On this occasion , Lestrade looked as rumpled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed in dark tweeds , his beard modestly trimmed beneath a more impressive moustache ; he had a pale , retiring aspect , and his eyes darted shyly between Holmesand myself . <p> My friend took them in at a glance . " How are you , Lestrade ? We should be delighted to offer you both coffee , or something stronger if required . I am pleased to make your acquaintance , Doctor ... ? " <p> " Llewellyn . At your service , sir , " our visitor replied with evident disquiet . <p> " Dr. Llewellyn , I assure you I am at yours . You will excuse my use of your prefix  --  you have recently sustained some slight injury to your right hand , and the way in which the dressing is fastened leads me to believe it was secured entirely by the aid of your own left appendage . And yet , the cloth is not of a variety to be found outside a medical facility . I should be shocked to learn our local surgeons have grown so slovenly as to require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are correct on all counts , sir  --  how very extraordinary . " <p> Holmes nodded briefly . " This is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson . " <p> " I am glad to meet you . I am glad to meet anyone willing to get to the bottom of this horrid affair . " <p> Holmes waved Lestrade and our nervous new acquaintance to their seats , the backs of the furnishings still entirely wreathed with newsprint . My friend then threw himself into his own armchair . <p> " You are here about Buck 's Row , I imagine , " he remarked . " You were knocked up yesterday , Dr. Llewellyn ? " <p> " My surgery is at one fifty-two Whitechapel Road , some few minutes ' distance , " he acknowledged . " I was summoned at slightly before four yesterday morning . I completed a postmortem examination just now . " <p> " One moment , if you please . Lestrade , while I am delighted to see you , as ever , why in God 's name have you waited an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've only just been reassigned two hours ago ! " Lestrade protested . " Inspector Spratling began it , then Helson . I wasted no time in bringing Dr. Llewellyn round . " <p> " My abject apologies , Inspector . " Holmessmiled . " Your haste was not lax ; it was unprecedented . " <p> " No more unprecedented than the corpse . If you had seen what I did at the morgue this morning , what Dr. Llewellyn here saw yesterday ... " Lestrade shook his head . " Your methods may be unconventional , but we need an end to this case as quick as is possible . There 's something about it that 's very queer , Mr. Holmes , and correct me if I 've the wrong end of the stick , but that 's where you tend to come in . " <p> Holmes settled back in his chair , half closing his eyes . " Very well , then . The story , as it happened to you , Dr. Llewellyn . " <p> " Well , Mr. Holmes , " Dr. Llewellyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold a medical practice in Whitechapel Road which I obtained after I finished my studies at the University of London . That main thoroughfare is quite respectable , and to a great extent , the same ailments parade across my consulting room from day to day  --  influenza , rheumatism , agues  --  the most peaceful of maladies . However , living in London 's East-end as I do , I occasionally find my work to be of a more unsettling nature . A regular patient of mine once burst into my offices with a nasty knife wound , as he 'd forgotten himself and wandered into a corner where some roughs thought his pocketbook worth trying for . I suppose that the immediate proximity of the slums would be all too obvious if I ever had cause to treat any of my poorest neighbours , but I fear they have n't the means . In the case of disease , they consult quack street doctors for penny compendia of gin or of laudanum . And in the case of injury , as their wounds were often got through misadventure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk dealing with police . <p> " That terrible murder in George Yard Buildings three weeks ago left a strong impression on my mind . We all were shocked by the ferocity of it . I can not convey to you my horror at what I was called upon to witness yesterday . " <p> Holmes held up a cautionary hand . " Please , " said he , " everything just as you saw it . " <p> " Buck 's Row is one of those sordid pitch-black byways of which Whitechapel boasts so many once the main road is abandoned . The body was situated at the entrance to a stable yard beneath a decrepit gateway . I saw nothing out of the ordinary save the body , but the inspector may have more to say on that subject . " <p> " I wish I did , " sighed Lestrade . " As you say , the body was the only thing out of the ordinary , as it were . " <p> " And the body ? " prompted Holmes . <p> " Something over thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow with a handkerchief . " She had brown hair and was missing several of her front teeth , but that characteristic did not seem to be a recent development . Nearly all of her was still warm , save her extremities . Her throat was savagely slashed two times . She may as well have been decapitated . Apart from her throat , I found her upper body to be completely intact , but the lower  --  she was ripped apart , Mr. Holmes . Her skirts were raised up to reveal the torso , and savage cuts penetrated her lower abdomen , exposing the internal organs . " <p> I regarded the doctor with dismay , but for Holmes , shock remained secondary to professional absorption . " Her chest was unharmed , you say ? Surely her garments , at least , were soiled with blood ? " <p> " She was wearing a brown frock , and I assure you it was entirely free of stain . " <p> " If that is the case , she was prostrate before the wound to her neck was administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the morgue . Name of Mary Ann ' Polly ' Nichols , identified by a friend from Lambeth Workhouse who calls herself Mary Ann Monk . Mark of the workhouse was on the petticoats , which led us to seek identification there . Shabby clothing , black bonnet , and she had on her person a comb , pocket handkerchief , and a piece of mirror . Morethan likely it 's all she had to her name . " <p> " What do you imagine the time of death to have been , Dr. Llewellyn ? " <p> " I arrived at three fifty a.m . She could not have been dead more than ten minutes . " <p> " And the gruesome discovery was made by whom ? " <p> " One Charles Cross , a carman on his way to work , " said Lestrade as he consulted his notes . " In my opinion , he 's merely a passerby . Poor chap was terrified . Constable Neil arrived on the scene shortly after and sent for Dr. Llewellyn here , hoping to save her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> We sat silent as the wind picked up . I wondered briefly whether Polly Nichols 's family knew of her hideous fate , and then whether she had any family to tell . <p> " Lestrade , " Holmessaid finally , " has the force had any luck in clearing up the murder of Martha Tabram early this month ? " <p> Lestrade shook his head perplexedly . " The inquest has just been reopened . I was not myself working on the case , but we 're all of the mind it was a tryst gone terribly wrong . Good Lord , Mr. Holmes , you do n't think these events could have been connected in any way ? " <p> " No , certainly not . I 've merely the professional certainty that two such outrageous crimes committed ten minutes ' walk apart from each other is remarkable enough to note . " <p> Dr. Llewellyn rose and reached for his hat . " I am very sorry I have not more to tell you gentlemen . I 'm afraid I must return to my practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " <p> " Be so good as to leave your card , Dr. Llewellyn , " said Holmes , shaking his hand absently . <p> " Of course . The best of luck to all of you . Do let me know if I can be of any further assistance . " <p> After Dr. Llewellyn 's departure , Lestrade turned a grave face to Holmes . <p> " I do n't like your harping on Martha Tabram one bit , Mr. Holmes . Surely the same man could n't have fallen out with both these women ? More likely Polly Nichols was killed by a jealous lover , or a gang , or one of her clients who 'd fallen into a drunken rage . " <p> " You are probably right . However , I beg that you will humour me far enough to fill me in on the details of both crimes . " <p> Lestrade shrugged . " If Tabram is of interest to you , of course I 've no objection . It should n't be difficult for me to gather up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I shall cast an eye over the evidence immediately . " <p> " You have full access , Mr. Holmes  --  just mention my name at the morgue or at the crime scene . I shall see you both at the Yard . " The inspector nodded and made his way out . <p> My friend crossed to the mantelpiece , shook a cigar out of an empty bud vase , and commenced smoking with the deepest absorption . " This Tabram murder is a very curious affair , " he commented . <p> " You mean the Nichols murder ? " <p> " I mean precisely what I say . " <p> " You thought little enough of it before , Holmes . " <p> " I expected every morning to read that they 'd solved it . Men do not often stab helpless females thirty-nine times and then disappear into the ether . The motive behind such an outrageous act would necessarily be sensational . " <p> " And such women necessarily have a great many associates , most of them untraceable , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retorted . " It is also obvious that the district of Whitechapel offers a great many natural advantages to the predator . Once the sun has fallen , you can hardly see your hand before your face , and the slaughterhouses allow blood-spattered men to pass without remark . What is less obvious is whether we have anything to fear from the proximity , in place and in time , of the two deaths . " <p> " It is certainly a distressing coincidence . " <p> Holmes shook his head and reached for his walking stick . <p> " One viciously maimed corpse is distressing . Two is something else entirely . I fear we have not a moment to lose .
