Last year , Susanna Clarke 's first novel , Jonathan Strange &; Mr. Norrell , became an international bestseller and won a passel of awards . Those of you who have read the book know that all we 've seen thus far of John Uskglass , the Raven King , is what other people think about him . Here now is a story that shows us a bit more of his life and character . ( Readers of JS &; MN might note that this story is the " curious tale " to which Mr. Norrell refers in chapter 63 . ) This story is reprinted with kind permission from Bloomsbury USAc from Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories , where it appears with an accompanying illustration by the great Charles Vess . Headnote This retelling of a popular Northern English folktale is taken from A Child 's History of the Raven King by John Waterbury , Lord Portishead . It bears similarities to other old stories in which a great ruler is outwitted by one of his humblest subjects and , because of this , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MANY SUMMERS AGO IN a clearing in a wood in Cumbria there lived a Charcoal Burner . He was a very poor man . His clothes were ragged and he was generally sooty and dirty . He had no wife or children , and his only companion was a small pig called Blakeman . Most of the time he stayed in the clearing which contained just two things : an earth-covered stack of smoldering charcoal and a hut built of sticks and pieces of turf . But in spite of all this he was a cheerful soul - unless crossed in any way . One bright summer 's morning a stag ran into the clearing . After the stag came a large pack of hunting dogs , and after the dogs came a crowd of horsemen with bows and arrows . For some moments nothing could be seen but a great confusion of baying dogs , sounding horns , and thundering hooves . Then , as quickly as they had come , the huntsmen disappeared among the trees at the far end of the clearing - all but one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churned to mud ; not a stick of his hut remained standing ; and his neat stack of charcoal was half-dismantled and fires were bursting forth from it . In a blaze of fury he turned upon the remaining huntsman and began to heap upon the man 's head every insult he had ever heard . But the huntsman had problems of his own . The reason that he had not ridden off with the others was that Blakeman was running , this way and that , beneath his horse 's hooves , squealing all the while . Try as he might , the huntsman could not get free of him . The huntsman was very finely dressed in black , with boots of soft black leather and a jeweled harness . He was in fact John Uskglass ( otherwise called the Raven King ) , King of Northern England and parts of Faerie , and the greatest magician that ever lived . But the Charcoal Burner ( whose knowledge of events outside the woodland clearing was very imperfect ) guessed nothing of this . He only knew that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . " Say something ! " he cried . A stream ran through the clearing . John Uskglass glanced at it , then at Blakeman running about beneath his horse 's hooves . He flung out a hand and Blakeman was transformed into a salmon . The salmon leapt through the air into the brook and swam away . Then John Uskglass rode off . The Charcoal Burner stared after him . " Well , now what am I going to do ? " he said . He extinguished the fires in the clearing and he repaired the stack of charcoal as best he could . But a stack of charcoal that has been trampled over by hounds and horses can not be made to look the same as one that has never received such injuries , and it hurt the Charcoal Burner 's eyes to look at such a botched , broken thing . He went down to Furness Abbey to ask the monks to give him some supper because his own supper had been trodden into the dirt . When he reached the Abbey he inquired for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poor . The Almoner greeted him in a kindly manner and gave him a beautiful round cheese and a warm blanket and asked what had happened to make his face so long and sad . So the Charcoal Burner told him ; but the Charcoal Burner was not much practiced in the art of giving clear accounts of complicated events . For example he spoke at great length about the huntsman who had got left behind , but he made no mention of the man 's fine clothes or the jeweled rings on his fingers , so the Almoner had no suspicion that it might be the King . In fact the Charcoal Burner called him " a black man " so that the Almoner imagined he meant a dirty man - just such another one as the Charcoal Burner himself . The Almoner was all sympathy . " So poor Blakeman is a salmon now , is he ? " he said . " If I were you , I would go and have a word with Saint Kentigern . I am sure he will help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you say ? And where will I find such a useful person ? " asked the Charcoal Burner eagerly . " He has a church in Grizedale . That is the road over there . " So the Charcoal Burner walked to Grizedale , and when he came to the church he went inside and banged on the walls and bawled out Saint Kentigern 's name , until Saint Kentigern looked out of Heaven and asked what the matter was . Immediately the Charcoal Burner began a long indignant speech describing the injuries that had been done to him , and in particular the part played by the solitary huntsman . " Well , " said Saint Kentigern , cheerfully . " Let me see what I can do . Saints , such as I , ought always to listen attentively to the prayers of poor , dirty , ragged men , such as you . No matter how offensively those prayers are phrased . You are our special care . " " I am though ? " said the Charcoal Burner , who was rather flattered to hear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand into the church font and pulled out a salmon . He shook the salmon a little and the next moment there was Blakeman , as dirty and clever as ever . The Charcoal Burner laughed and clapped his hands . He tried to embrace Blakeman but Blakeman just ran about , squealing , with his customary energy . " There , " said Saint Kentigern , looking down on this pleasant scene with some delight . " I am glad I was able to answer your prayer . " " Oh , but you have not ! " declared the Charcoal Burner . " You must punish my wicked enemy ! " Then Saint Kentigern frowned a little and explained how one ought to forgive one 's enemies . But the Charcoal Burner had never practiced Christian forgiveness before and he was not in a mood to begin now . " Let Blencathra fall on his head ! " he cried with his eyes ablaze and his fists held high . ( Blencathra is a high hill some miles to the north of Grizedale . ) " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really can not do that . But I think you said this man was a hunter ? Perhaps the loss of a day 's sport will teach him to treat his neighbours with more respect . " The moment that Saint Kentigern said these words , John Uskglass ( who was still hunting ) tumbled down from his horse and into a cleft in some rocks . He tried to climb out but found that he was held there by some mysterious power . He tried to do some magic to counter it , but the magic did not work . The rocks and earth of England loved John Uskglass well . They would always wish to help him if they could , but this power - whatever it was - was something they respected even more . He remained in the cleft all day and all night , until he was thoroughly cold , wet , and miserable . At dawn the unknown power suddenly released him - why , he could not tell . He climbed out , found his horse , and rode back to his castle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William of Lanchester . " We expected you yesterday . " Now John Uskglass did not want any one to know that there might be a magician in England more powerful than himself . So he thought for a moment . " France , " he said . " France ! " William of Lanchester looked surprized . " And did you see the King ? What did he say ? Are they planning new wars ? " John Uskglass gave some vague , mystical , and magician-like reply . Then he went up to his room and sat down upon the floor by his silver dish of water . Then he spoke to Persons of Great Importance ( such as the West Wind or the Stars ) and asked them to tell him who had caused him to be thrown into the cleft . Into his dish came a vision of the Charcoal Burner . John Uskglass called for his horse and his dogs , and he rode to the clearing in the wood . Meanwhile the Charcoal Burner was toasting some of the cheese the Almoner had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were few things in the world that Blakeman liked as much as toasted cheese . While he was gone John Uskglass arrived with his dogs . He looked around at the clearing for some clue as to what had happened . He wondered why a great and dangerous magician would chuse to live in a wood and earn his living as a charcoal burner . His eye fell upon the toasted cheese . Now toasted cheese is a temptation few men can resist , be they charcoal burners or kings . John Uskglass reasoned thus : all of Cumbria belonged to him - therefore this wood belonged to him - therefore this toasted cheese belonged to him . So he sat down and ate it , allowing his dogs to lick his fingers when he was done . At that moment the Charcoal Burner returned . He stared at John Uskglass and at the empty green leaves where his toasted cheese had been . " You ! " he cried . " It is you ! You ate my dinner ! " He took hold of John Uskglass and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? " John Uskglass said not a word . ( He felt himself to be at something of a disadvantage . ) He shook himself free from the Charcoal Burner 's grasp , mounted upon his horse and rode out of the clearing . The Charcoal Burner went down to Furness Abbey again . " That wicked man came back and ate my toasted cheese ! " he told the Almoner . The Almoner shook his head sadly at the sinfulness of the world . " Have some more cheese , " he offered . " And perhaps some bread to go with it ? " " Which saint is it that looks after cheeses ? " demanded the Charcoal Burner . The Almoner thought for a moment . " That would be Saint Bridget , " he said . " And where will I find her ladyship ? " asked the Charcoal Burner , eagerly . " She has a church at Beckermet , " replied the Almoner , and he pointed the way the Charcoal Burner ought to take . So the Charcoal Burner walked to Beckermet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates together and roared and made a great deal of noise until Saint Bridget looked anxiously out of Heaven and asked if there was any thing she could do for him . The Charcoal Burner gave a long description of the injuries his silent enemy had done him . Saint Bridget said she was sorry to hear it . " But I do not think I am the proper person to help you . I look after milkmaids and dairymen . I encourage the butter to come and the cheeses to ripen . I have nothing to do with cheese that has been eaten by the wrong person . Saint Nicholas looks after thieves and stolen property . Or there is Saint " Alexander of Comana who loves Charcoal Burners . Perhaps , " she added hopefully , " you would like to pray to one of them ? " The Charcoal Burner declined to take an interest in the persons she mentioned . " Poor , ragged , dirty men like me are your special care ! " he insisted . " Do a miracle ! " " But perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean to offend you by his silence . Have you considered that he may be mute ? " " Oh , no ! I saw him speak to his dogs . They wagged their tails in delight to hear his voice . Saint , do your work ! Let Blencathra fall on his head ! " Saint Bridget sighed . " No , no , we can not do that ; but certainly he is wrong to steal your dinner . Perhaps it might be as well to teach him a lesson . Just a small one . " At that moment John Uskglass and his court were preparing to go hunting . A cow wandered into the stable yard . It ambled up to where John Uskglass stood by his horse and began to preach him a sermon in Latin on the wickedness of stealing . Then his horse turned its head and told him solemnly that it quite agreed with the cow and that he should pay good attention to what the cow said . All the courtiers and the servants in the stable yard fell silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened before . " This is magic ! " declared William of Lanchester . " But who would dare ... ? " " I did it myself , " said John Uskglass quickly . " Really ? " said William . " Why ? " There was a pause . " To help me contemplate my sins and errors , " said John Uskglass at last , " as a Christian should from time to time . " " But stealing is not a sin of yours ! So why ... ? " " Good God , William ! " cried John Uskglass . " Must you ask so many questions ? I shall not hunt today ! " He hurried away to the rose garden to escape the horse and the cow . But the roses turned their red-and-white faces toward him and spoke at length about his duty to the poor , - and some of the more ill-natured flowers hissed , " Thief ! Thief ! " He shut his eyes and put his fingers in his ears , but his dogs came and found him and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very disappointed they were in him . So he went and hid in a bare little room at the top of the castle . But all that day the stones of the walls loudly debated the various passages in the Bible that condemn stealing . John Uskglass had no need to inquire who had done this ( the cow , horse , dogs , stones and roses had all made particular mention of toasted cheese ) ; and he was determined to discover who this strange magician was and what he wanted . He decided to employ that most magical of all creatures - the raven . An hour later a thousand or so ravens were despatched in a flock so dense that it was as if a black mountain were flying through the summer sky . When they arrived at the Charcoal Burner 's clearing , they filled every part of it with a tumult of black wings . The leaves were swept from the trees , and the Charcoal Burner and Blakeman were knocked to the ground and battered about . The ravens searched the Charcoal Burner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the safe side , they searched Blakeman 's memories and dreams too . The ravens looked to see what man and pig had thought when they were still in their mothers " wombs , - and they looked to see what both would do when finally they came to Heaven . They found not a scrap of magic anywhere . When they were gone , John Uskglass walked into the clearing with his arms folded , frowning . He was deeply disappointed at the ravens " failure . The Charcoal Burner got slowly up from the ground and looked around in amazement . If a fire had ravaged the wood , the destruction could scarcely have been more complete . The branches were torn from the trees and a thick , black layer of raven feathers lay over everything . In a sort of ecstasy of indignation , he cried , " Tell me why you persecute me ! " But John Uskglass said not a word . " I will make Blencathra fall on your head ! I will do it ! You know I can ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You - know I - can ! " The next day the Charcoal Burner appeared at Furness Abbey before the sun was up . He found the Almoner , who was on his way to Prime . " He came back and shattered my wood , " he told him . " He made it black and ugly ! " " What a terrible man ! " said the Almoner , sympathetically . " What saint is in charge of ravens ? " demanded the Charcoal Burner . " Ravens ? " said the Almoner . " None that I know of . " He thought for a moment . " Saint Oswald had a pet raven of which he was extremely fond . " " And where would I find his saintliness ? " " He has a new church at Grasmere . " So the Charcoal Burner walked to Grasmere and when he got there , he shouted and banged on the walls with a candlestick . Saint Oswald put his head out of Heaven and cried , " Do you have to shout so loud ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down that candlestick ! It was expensive ! " During their holy and blessed lives Saint Kentigern and Saint Bridget had been a monk and a nun respectively ; they were full of mild , saintly patience . But Saint Oswald had been a king and a soldier , and he was a very different sort of person . " The Almoner at Furness Abbey says you like ravens , " explained the Charcoal Burner . " ' Like " is putting it a little strong , " said Saint Oswald . " There was a bird in the seventh century that used to perch on my shoulder . It pecked my ears and made them bleed . " The Charcoal Burner described how he was persecuted by the silent man . " Well , perhaps he has reason for behaving as he does ? " said Saint Oswald , sarcastically . " Have you , for example , made great big dents in his expensive candlesticks ? " The Charcoal Burner indignantly denied ever having hurt the silent man . " Hmm , " said Saint Oswald , thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Charcoal Burner looked blank . " Let us see , " said Saint Oswald . " A man in black clothes , with powerful magic and ravens at his command , and the hunting rights of a king . This suggests nothing to you ? No , apparently it does not . Well , it so happens that I think I know the person you mean . He is indeed very arrogant arid perhaps the time has come to humble him a little . If I understand you aright , you are angry because he does not speak to you ? " " Yes . " " Well then , I believe I shall loosen his tongue a little . " " What sort of punishment is that ? " asked the Charcoal Burner . " I want you to make Blencathra fall on his head ! " Saint Oswald made a sound of irritation . " What do you know of it ? " he said . " Believe me , I am a far better judge than you of how to hurt this man ! " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid and rather excited manner . This was unusual but did not at first seem sinister . All his courtiers and servants listened politely . But minutes went by - and then hours - and he did not stop talking . He talked through dinner , - he talked through mass ; he talked through the night . He made prophecies , recited Bible passages , told the histories of various fairy kingdoms , gave recipes for pies . He gave away political secrets , magical secrets , infernal secrets , Divine secrets , and scandalous secrets - as a result of which the Kingdom of Northern England was thrown into various political and theological crises . Thomas of Dundale and William of Lanchester begged and threatened and pleaded , but nothing they said could make the King stop talking . Eventually they were obliged to lock him in the little room at the top of the castle so that no one else could hear him . Then , since it was inconceivable that a king should talk without someone listening , they were obliged to stay with him , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two days later he rode into the Charcoal Burner 's clearing . He looked so pale and worn that the Charcoal Burner was in high hopes that Saint Oswald might have relented and pushed Blencathra on his head . " What is it that you want from me ? " asked John Uskglass , warily . " Ha ! " said the Charcoal Burner with triumphant looks . " Ask my pardon for turning poor Blakeman into a fish ! " A long silence . Then with gritted teeth , John Uskglass asked the Charcoal Burner 's pardon . " Is there any thing else you want ? " he asked . " Repair all the hurts you did me ! " Immediately the Charcoal Burner 's stack and hut reappeared just as they had always been ; the trees were made whole again , - fresh , green leaves covered their branches ; and a sweet lawn of soft grass spread over the clearing . " Any thing else ? " The Charcoal Burner closed his eyes and strained to summon up an image of unthinkable wealth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to suspect that he had made a miscalculation somewhere - though he could not for his life tell where it was . Nevertheless he felt confident enough to say , " I will grant you a pig - if you promise that you will tell no one who gave it to you or why . " " How can I ? " said the Charcoal Burner . " I do not know who you are . Why ? " he said , narrowing his eyes . " Who are you ? " " No one , " said John Uskglass quickly . Another pig appeared , the very twin of Blakeman , and while the Charcoal Burner was exclaiming over his good fortune , John Uskglass got on his horse and rode away in a condition of the most complete mystification . Shortly after that he returned to his capital city of Newcastle . In the next fifty or sixty years his lords and servants often reminded him of the excellent hunting to be had in Cumbria , but he was careful never to go there again until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
