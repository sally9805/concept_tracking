Section : SYMPOSIUM : SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION-REFORMS OR ALTERNATIVES ? <p> The papers here presented were delivered at the ninth general conference of the National Association of Scholars in New York City . As the overall theme , the conference organizers chose " Taking Measure : Higher Education at the Turn of the Century . " Subsequently adapted for publication , these three papers comprise the bulk of a panel that convened on the afternoon of 13 January 2001 . <p> Hannah Arendt once wrote that if we seek the authority of an educator , we must accept responsibility both for ourselves and the world we are creating . Placing the full burden of blame on schools of education for our profound and merited frustrations over American K-12 education fails to meet Arendt 's standard . As harried parents , as consumers of cultural kitsch , as education administrators , as K-16 faculty , or simply as citizens , each of us contributes to the climate in which our children grow up . Too often , it is not a climate that provides any source of reasoned authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , our polity ought to deliver a clear message to schools of education about what we want from our schools . Surely we can agree that our children should be numerate , literate , and prepared to become ethical and productive citizens . But these basic desiderata have become lost in a maelstrom of confusion about educational goals . As David Tyack and Larry Cuban observe , America wants its teachers PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> These tensions have only increased as the financial returns for higher levels of education have multiplied , and the demands by diverse social and ethnic groups for new levels of recognition have expanded . <p> The result of it all can be seen in the patterns of our educational reform efforts . We want high standards and accountability for all , but when students ' tests reveal how far we are from reaching those standards , fearful state departments of education , backed by state legislators , start watering down both the tests and the consequences of failing them. 3 We speak of higher standards in one breath , and in the next , of ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely noting that the demand for the second goal can undermine the first . <p> Such is the context within which schools of education must operate . Let there be no misunderstanding , however . Too many of our 1,370 Ed schools have no admissions standards , offer chaotic courses often bereft of serious intellectual content , and embrace a bizarre collection of educational half-truths and simple falsities . However , before we simply accept the temptation to get rid of them , it would be best to consider the main alternatives with a clear head . <p> First , what might be termed the emergency rescue plan . Take a middle-aged professional of good character , high self-confidence , and a resume that included at some point a good degree . Give such a person a quick crash course in what it means to face a room of today 's American public school children , provide a modest cash incentive , and put him or her into the classroom . Massachusetts has been trying a version of this plan , and the results are far from rosy . My colleague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district , reports that after the first year , about half of these bonus teachers had to be fired for incompetence or left of their own accord . ( All of these people looked good on paper , often multilingual and displaying advanced degrees from world-class universities . ) Of those who are left , there are , to be sure , a small handful of gems . The rest are going to require a large , continuous , and expensive effort of professional support . <p> In an America in which 25 percent of school-age children will come to school with limited English proficiency within twenty five years , in which an ever increasing Hispanic school population is doing even more poorly than our urban African American children , in which students would far rather be " druggies " than " nerds , " we are not simply going to be able to wave a magic wand over well-meaning middle-aged engineers and turn them into the teachers who will save our schools . <p> If the recourse to teachers drawn directly from the other professions affords only modest results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now receiving widespread endorsement , is to offer teacher preparation on site in the K-12 schools . Increasingly , legislative approval is being given to alternative paths to teacher certification . These paths enable would-be teachers to circumvent the requirement of an undergraduate or graduate education degree . Suffice it that you get a BA degree , pass the basic teachers test , sign up for some form of pre-service training or apprenticeship in a school , and then you will teach in that school . <p> There are multiple variations on this basic theme . One version is found in the form of so-called " professional development schools , " a fashionable title for a partnership between schools of education and the schools in which the student-teacher is placed . There are now almost 500 of these programs nationwide : instead of attending a school of education and completing a degree , student-teachers will take seminars and conduct studies during the time when they are not watching teachers teach or not undertaking supervised teaching of their own . <p> But who will be in charge of these professional development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools will supervise and conduct ? Probably not enlightened humanists fresh from reading Jacques Barzun . The irony is that , too often , vital elements of teacher preparation will be put in the hands of those who are the product of the very system we are trying to change-namely current school teachers in partnership with some of the weakest elements of our schools of education . Let me offer an example . In Massachusetts , student-teachers can take multiple day programs at MINT-the Massachusetts Institute of New Teaching . While the literature from the institute lists a 90-minute session on literacy ( no details given ) , it offers several half-day sessions in sensitivity awareness and other educational dross . As a whole , the program is even less likely to offer a substantive preparation for teaching than was available at the Ed schools that are rushing to be part of it . <p> The new certification requirements from the Department of Education in our state , now reaching their final form , speak of allowing many different " MINT " like programs to be delivered by " approved providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as easily " approved " as the scores of providers of often useless professional development seminars now offered to in-service teachers . Critics argue that Ed schools are preparing teachers for schools that exist , not those we need . But they hand over the critical part of teacher preparation to existing schools , or to bogus graduate programs organized by the very school districts or second-rate schools of education whose dismal ways they are so critical of . Unless the few good Ed schools offer something far more serious and thoughtful , this whole initiative will only further erode the quality of teacher preparation. 4 While healthy competition is to be welcomed , it is not clear that there is yet much quality to be found in the market . <p> The third suggestion for how to reform teacher education without schools of education is based on the premise that if we can not bypass universities altogether , perhaps we should put the academic preparation of teachers completely into the colleges of arts and sciences . These noble institutions thus become the saviors of teacher preparation . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report on colleges of arts and sciences commissioned by the National Association of Scholars . I need not reiterate the devastating findings of that report , its damning evidence of watered down or abolished general education courses , its careful documentation of the widespread absence of academically rigorous requirements . If we should seem wary of the theoretical approaches prevalent in some of our schools of education , we might take a closer look at the thousands of programs now offered by our colleges and universities . <p> And here is the rub . In our eagerness to tear down the schools of education for their many sins-teaching gobbets of Dewey poorly understood , producing " research findings " that no first rate statistician would take seriously , preaching whole language instruction and the rest-we may be overlooking some important facts . First , in contrast to the colleges of arts and sciences , the state , through its licensure requirements , can have a direct influence on Ed schools and particularly on what they teach . Under pressure from the state , there is a real possibility that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences to add solid core courses to their offerings . This is not just wishful thinking : to give one of many examples , Michigan State University ( one of the largest producers of teachers ) has introduced a new sequence of core mathematics courses in its college of arts and sciences . Without them , it could not have provided the essential foundation needed by teachers of mathematics . Such courses will benefit all students . But if the state tells arts and science programs that they will now have to change their offerings and find places for education students , only navet would lead us to expect success . <p> In short , schools of education enjoy no monopoly on the provision of an inadequate education . The critical issue is to determine where we can have the most influence . In most states , schools of education must prepare students for state certification examinations , and must offer a curriculum approved of by the state . Properly used , the power of the state can re-direct our teacher preparation programs . Although this may have to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The academic records of students admitted to Ed schools have stopped falling , and in many of our top schools of education , the GPA and SAT scores of would-be teachers are barely distinguishable from their arts and science counterparts . By publishing the results of teacher tests from different schools of education , the state can put pressure on poor schools to improve further. 5 <p> Moreover , course offerings and even ideological convictions are not set in stone . Vanderbilt University 's school of education , a home to much constructivism , sent faculty to help introduce E.D. Hirsch 's core curriculum into Nashville 's public schools , and now has Jim Guthrie , a champion of rigorous standards and assessments , as head of its policy department . There is even a small hope that the education profession as a whole may begin to see the handwriting on the wall . In a recent volume of the Journal of Teacher Education , one could find a plea to PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Schools of education are beginning to embrace a larger role . They can run a deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible role in shaping the World Bank 's vast educational programs . Such schools develop materials in mathematics education with a proven record of raising student test scores or teach the great books to future kindergarten teachers . One can even find all of the above in just one school of education that I am proud to call my professional home . <p> Having suggested that eliminating or bypassing schools of education may not be the panacea to our educational ills , let me close with some speculations about what a school of education might become . Our better Ed school would put pressure on universities to offer rigorous courses in the core disciplines . It would encourage top scholars from all parts of the university to be part of academically rich professional development programs of the kind Harvard provides in its Teachers as Scholars initiative . The better school of education would ensure that prospective teachers have a background in the history of American education , in a rigorous philosophy of education , in current policy debates , and be aware of the limits of educational research to date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so many puppets dancing on the strings of educational whim , but rather that we equip them to analyze their profession dispassionately and thoroughly . That same Ed school would work to ensure that technology is harnessed for the purpose of learning , not " edutainment . " Serving as a place where young students determined on a teaching career can be with others like themselves , this Ed school would provide support and encouragement for a courageous career choice . It would signal a respect for the future profession of its students by inviting top-performing teachers into visiting or term faculty appointments so as to fuse the best lessons of practice into teacher preparation . Such a school of education would develop reasoned ways of distinguishing the performance of their graduates from those of institutions peddling nonsense . ( A graduate of Harvard Law school is not paid the same salary as one from Podunk U. Tellingly in education it makes little or no difference where a teacher was trained . ) Finally , our school would contribute to the public policy debate , urging such critical reforms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school teachers . <p> We are , as ever , at a point where the future of teacher preparation is wide open for innovation and debate . One direction forward points to the further infantilization of the teaching profession . Here we encounter a game of musical chairs , in which the same players with the same nostrums find new sites to go on doing what they have done for forty years . A second direction points to ever more stringent state control . It is one thing for the state to lay out a reasonable set of academic requirements for future teachers-this it should do . It is quite another to believe that the state should , as is the case now in England , define every aspect of educational preparation , including what subjects future teachers are allowed to study . ( The British Teacher Training Agency , in its extraordinary assumption of powers , has failed to grasp the irony in Charles Dickens 's dark anticipation of just such a development in Hazel Times . ) The third path , the path I am advocating , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in reshaping teacher preparation programs . <p> No leadership will be possible , however , unless we are prepared to take up the issues with which I began . Recalling the Ancient Greek conception of Paideia , I have over the years asked my students at Harvard , Vanderbilt , and Boston universities to discuss their conception of an educated human being . Their silence has always been telling . Until we are all prepared to articulate , defend , and teach such a conception , casting animadversions on schools of education will continue to represent something more akin to hubris than to wisdom . <p>
