ONE We lived on Victor Hugo Street in a rambling , dilapidated house that was the family 's last remaining asset . For years the Old Man had strung a living together in pale bits and pieces , like popcorn on a string , freelance editing , book reviews , a little fact-checking here and there , the table droppings of the literary profession . Sometimes , when his ever-fluctuating mood allowed it , he 'd even worked as a substitute teacher at the local high school . He called this " educational day labor , " and despised it . His students were beneath him , as were the lowly , salaried teachers who , he said , pursued their modest pensions like scraps of holy writ . His contempt was bottomless , and it erupted in fits of spiraling rage . In the midst of such seizures , he used the telephone like a whip . In the room where I was made to study , a tiny thing beneath its towering bookshelves , I could hear him leafing through the ever-expanding pages of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , each entry made up of the enemy name and occupation , along with the Old Man 's one-word judgment : James Elton , professor , lackey ; Carolyn Bender , editor , coward ; Stephen Horowitz , headmaster , charlatan ; and the like . At some point he would inevitably select certain names from this roll of the damned . Then the calls would begin . I remembered a particular afternoon when I'dsuddenly paused outside the door of his study , then glanced through its slightly open door . He was sitting behind his desk , screaming into the phone : You are a fake , you hear me ! You are a plagiarist ! I listened as he steamed on , citing the crimes and misdemeanors of whomever he 'd called . He 'd gone on and on , then abruptly stopped , so that I 'd heard the voice at the other end , metallic and inexpressive , The time allotted for this message has expired . Please call again to continue . It was pathetic , I thought at the time , all that mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . King Lear had thundered against our earthly plight . In comparison , the Old Man 's fury seemed little more than sour grapes monstrously inflated . When he died , I felt that a dark , devouring force had been stilled at last . I wore his death like wings . At the gravesite , I told my sister exactly that , then added , " You can go on with your life , Diana . You do n't have to take care of him anymore . " She nodded silently , then tossed a single rose into his grave . And I thought , At last she 's free of him . At last she can be happy . But then came Death , as the Old Man might have put it in his stilted and archaic dictum , an untimely death that came like that fabled highwayman whose poetic exploits Diana had so often recited for his pleasure , Riding , riding , riding , as I can hear her even now , up to the old inn door . It was a Friday afternoon when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jason 's death and that no one would be held accountable for it . Since Diana had already separated from her husband , Mark , by then , I 'd come to the courthouse with her instead , the two of us seated at the front of an almost empty courtroom , listening silently as the judge declared Jason a " victim of misadventure . " " Shallow , " Diana whispered . Then she stared directly at the judge , watching as he rose and left the room . " Shallow , " she repeated in a tone exactly like the Old Man 's when he closed a book and with a word pronounced his verdict . I started to get up , and expected Diana to do the same , but she did n't move . " Not yet , " she said , and gently tugged me back down onto the bench beside her . She remained seated for a long time , her hand resting on mine , both of us now waiting as Mark rose and left the courtroom . He was dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he left , his eyes briefly darted toward Diana , then no less quickly skirted away . For her part , Diana never glanced toward Mark , but instead held her gaze on the mythical representation of blind justice that hung from the wood-paneled wall behind the judge 's bench . She breathed slowly , rhythmically , and her hands remained steady , with no hint of trembling . She kept her back straight , her head erect , and seemed determined to stay that way , not to grow faint or swoon . In such an attitude , she looked more like a warrior than a grieving mother , as if grief itself had become a lifted sword . Her eyes were dry and her lips were pressed together tightly , like someone sealing in a scream , though other than the few words she 'd already uttered , she made no sound at all . After a moment , she closed her eyes and for those few seconds she actually looked resigned to the court 's decision , ready to accept it and move on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go now . " She nodded but her eyes remained closed , her body eerily still . After a moment , people began to trickle back into the courtroom , Bill Carnegie among them , looking suitably solemn in his neat gray suit . He 'd represented Mark in the divorce , though there 'd been little for him to do beyond making the offer Diana had immediately accepted . " Hello , Dave , " he said as he passed on his way to the defense table . Diana opened her eyes and stared at him . " Hello , Mrs. Regan , " Carnegie said . " I 'm Miss Sears now , " Diana told him , though without any hint of bitterness , merely a fact-checker making a small correction . " Ah yes , of course , " Carnegie said . " The court has determined that my son died by misadventure , " Diana added . Bill glanced at me warily then turned back to Diana . " Anyway , nice seeing you , " he said , and quickly continued down the aisle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radiant late September afternoon , its light so bright it seemed to sparkle . Diana drew her hair into a bun and pinned it , exposing her long white neck in such a way that she looked oddly sacrificial , like a woman to be killed in exchange for rain . We reached my car , and without a word Diana took her place on the passenger side and waited for me to get in behind the wheel . She said nothing as I put the key in the ignition , turned it , and began to back out of the shady space where I 'd parked . We were already at the main road before she spoke . " Truth matters , does n't it , Davey ? " she asked . Her question abruptly returned me to the dinner-table inquisitions I 'd endured from the Old Man , philosophical questions to which he 'd demanded quotation-studded responses . His intimidating voice crackled in the air : What say you , my young Daedalus ? " You sound like the Old Man , " I told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Diana said . I shrugged , as if wholly indifferent to the mention of his name , though I continued to recall the nightly interrogations at the dinnertable , the Old Man firing questions or demanding that I recite whatever passage he 'd assigned me . I 'd always responded haltingly , stammering and faltering , forgetting lines , going blank . Which was when Diana had always cut in , lifting her small white hand into the air , saving me from any further ridicule or humiliation . " Bleak House , " Diana murmured . Before the Old Man 's death it had been typical of Diana to encapsulate everything in a book title , as if her mind worked in a high-velocity shorthand . But the practice had abruptly disappeared at his gravesite , and it surprised me that she 'd suddenly returned to it . " Not bleak for you , " I said . " You were his shining star . " Again I found myself returned to the house on Victor Hugo Street , watching Diana from the shadowy corner where I stood like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , the Old Man erect in a chair before her , breathing softly , his shining black eyes fixed upon her . These recitations had been the way she 'd found to quench the fires that burned inside him , the rage he felt for the world 's indifference to his genius , its corruption and mediocrity , what he called , quoting the Rubiyt , " the sorry Scheme of Things entire . " " He could be cruel , " Diana said . " What he said to you that last day . " I saw him turn as Diana led me into his study , the cold glint in his eyes , that twitching mouth , the dreadful words they formed . You are dust to me . " But he was crazy , " Diana said . " He did n't know what he was doing . " Her mood was clearly darkening . I moved to stop its descent . " Why do n't you have dinner with us tonight , " I said . " We can all relax . It 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , then hit the small button on the console and locked all the doors . Her eyes shot over to me . " I 'm not going to jump out of the car , Davey , " she said . " I know what I 'm doing . " She seemed suddenly seized by a grim recollection . " Do n't ever think that I 'm like Dad . "
