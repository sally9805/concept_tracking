<p> A luxury private jet leased by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for use in emergencies has been used instead primarily to shuttle Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt to dozens of news conferences and meetings , a Journal-Constitution analysis of the aircraft 's flight log shows . <p> CDC officials said that since January they have needed to use the aircraft to respond to three emergencies and conduct three training exercises . Meanwhile , Leavitt has taken the jet on 19 trips to visit more than 90 cities , his spokeswoman said . Most of Leavitt 's travel was to promote the new Medicare prescription drug plan and to make appearances at state pandemic flu planning meetings . <p> During two of the CDC 's emergencies , Leavitt was traveling on the Gulfstream III jet , requiring the agency to use another plane . <p> So far in 2006 , leasing and using the aircraft has cost taxpayers $2.1 million , according to CDC and HHS officials . <p> Other Cabinet members  --  including the secretaries of labor , agriculture , treasury and veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leavitt 's spokeswoman , Christina Pearson , said his regular use of the CDC jet in 2006 has been appropriate and in compliance with federal guidelines . Prior to this year , Leavitt flew commercial , except after Hurricane Katrina when he used government planes for trips to the Gulf Coast , Pearson said . <p> Last fall , Congress authorized Leavitt to use the CDC jet at his discretion because of his significant responsibilities " in times of emergencies " and during " significant events . " <p> Without the CDC jet , Pearson said , it would have been impossible for Leavitt to barnstorm the country to help millions of senior citizens sign up for the new Medicare drug benefit , and to personally assess some of the early problems with the program . And he 's needed it to help mobilize the country in its preparations for a possible influenza pandemic , as well as to go to New Orleans to help the city rebuild its health care infrastructure , she added . <p> " These pressing challenges had to be addressed within a limited period and require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearson said , noting that when feasible , he has flown commercial . <p> Taxpayers will find Leavitt 's jet-setting outrageous , said Keith Ashdown , vice president for policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense , a Washington-based group that looks for government waste and has been critical of the Medicare drug plan . <p> " This is a gold-plated jet to promote a boondoggle of a prescription plan , " Ashdown said . " He 's getting the CDC to pay for his own personal political travel . " <p> The CDC 's director , Dr. Julie Gerberding , said she has no problem with her boss using the CDC jet . " I think that the priority for the plane needs to be public health emergencies , " Gerberding said , but she said Leavitt 's responsibilities also merit access to a government aircraft . <p> She noted that the CDC 's contract with its aircraft vendor allows the agency to take a second plane if the main jet is being used . <p> " I think the arrangement has protected our ability to use it when we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time Gerberding has flown on the jet in 2006 was to accompany Leavitt on two trips to meetings about a possible flu pandemic , said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner . One was in February to Florida , Ohio and Nevada . The other was in March to South Dakota , North Dakota , Wyoming and Montana . <p> Pearson said Leavitt  --  a former three-term governor of Utah who headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when he was tapped for his current post  --  was not available to be interviewed for this article . <p> Based in North Georgia <p> The jet , a Gulfstream III , is based at an airport in Cartersville , about an hour northwest of the CDC headquarters in Atlanta . It is operated by two pilots and can seat 14 people , according to the CDC . It has four leather captain 's chairs , two three-seat leather couches and two four-seat leather couches . The couches can fold into beds . There are two bathrooms . While there is no flight attendant , a small galley has a refrigerator and microwave for snacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Group of Cartersville began in December , Skinner said . <p> Taxpayers pay Phoenix Air Group $252,000 a month for the CDC to have access to the jet , or a similar one , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . When the plane is used , it costs an additional $3,000 for every flight hour . The fees cover the jet , its pilots , maintenance , fuel and related expenses . If the main jet is busy and the CDC needs access to a second plane , it costs just flight time fees . <p> From Jan. 1 through June 1 , the CDC had incurred $1.26 million in monthly fees and $164,000 in hourly flight charges and taxes . HHS had racked up an additional $720,000 in flight charges on the CDC jet . Pearson said HHS reimburses the CDC for hourly flight fees , but does not pay any of the monthly cost of having the plane . <p> Congress mandated that the CDC share its aircraft with Leavitt last fall , when language was slipped into the department 's budget . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was available to Leavitt " in times of emergencies and in the days following such emergencies " because of his role in directing public health responses " to significant events , " according to Congress ' conference report on the bill . <p> " The availability of CDC 's charter aircraft will allow the secretary to immediately return to Washington or rapidly move to another location as the situation dictates , at the same time being able to securely communicate with and direct the department , " the report says . <p> The report notes that Congress expects the jet to be used " in an economical and judicious manner . " <p> Pearson , Leavitt 's spokeswoman , would not identify the member of Congress who put the language in the budget bill . Gerberding said she does not know who did it . <p> Rep. Ralph Regula ( R-Ohio ) , chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees the HHS and CDC budgets , did not respond to questions about who inserted the language and whether Leavitt 's trips have been appropriate . <p> Instead , Regula issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural disaster and other emergencies , I believe the secretary and appropriate staff must be given access to every tool necessary to respond to urgent needs . " <p> Asked whether Leavitt 's trips jibe with the conference report 's language about emergency use , Pearson said yes . " These are significant events , " she said , calling the effort to sign up seniors for the new drug plan and preparing states for a possible pandemic " the biggest health care challenges facing this country right now . " <p> Key Democrat critical <p> Rep. Henry Waxman of California , the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee , said , " It is mind-boggling that the secretary would commandeer for his own personal convenience a jet that is supposed to be used by CDC for public health emergencies . " <p> Sen. Michael Enzi ( R-Wyo. ) , chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , which has authority over the CDC and HHS , declined to comment on a list of flights taken by Leavitt . But a committee spokesman commended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required extensive travel and might not have been possible without the use of a government-owned aircraft , " said Craig Orfield , the committee 's spokesman . <p> The Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress , over the years has urged agencies to determine whether airplanes are " essential or merely nice to have . " <p> Pearson said it would have been impossible for Leavitt to visit so many places flying commercial , she said . <p> During one ambitious three-day stretch in April , Leavitt used the CDC jet  --  along with some driving  --  to make appearances in Louisville , Ky. ; Toledo , Dayton , Columbus , and Cleveland , Ohio ; Peoria , Ill. ; Davenport , Cedar Rapids , and Des Moines , Iowa ; Sioux Falls , S.D. ; and suburban Minneapolis , before boarding a commercial flight back to Washington , according to the jet 's flight log and Pearson . <p> At almost all the stops , Leavitt held press events to promote the Medicare drug plan , which his department runs , according to news releases issued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and attended roundtables with local business leaders . <p> Pearson noted that before Leavitt asks the jet to leave Georgia to pick him up at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington , his staff always checks with the CDC to make sure the aircraft is n't needed for a health emergency . <p> Caught by emergencies <p> Twice this year , Leavitt has been traveling in the jet when emergencies occurred unexpectedly . <p> The first was an anthrax case diagnosed in late February , while Leavitt was in the midst of a three-day trip for meetings in New Orleans about the city 's recovery , Medicare drug plan events in Mobile , and flu meetings in Pensacola , Fla. , Birmingham and Lincoln , Neb . <p> An African dancer had contracted inhalation anthrax after cutting animal hides to make drums in his New York City apartment . He collapsed during a performance in Pennsylvania and was hospitalized with breathing problems that doctors diagnosed as anthrax . <p> When the CDC notified Leavitt of the emergency , " we jumped off the plane in Birmingham , " said Pearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then the CDC had already dispatched another plane from its contractor to pick up specimens from the dancer . <p> When the CDC jet returned to Georgia from Birmingham , it picked up a team of CDC investigators and took them to locations the dancer had visited in Cincinnati , Pennsylvania and New York , according to the flight log and Skinner . <p> The second instance occurred June 1 , the official start of the hurricane season , when Leavitt used the jet to fly from Washington to New Orleans to meet with state and local health officials about the city 's recovery and preparations for future storms . <p> While the jet was in New Orleans , the CDC got an emergency call about a laboratory accident in San Juan , Puerto Rico , that had exposed a person to radioactive material . Health care workers on the island needed the CDC to send doses of Prussian blue , a compound that is used to remove radioactive materials from victims ' bodies . <p> The CDC used another plane from its contractor to transport the Prussian blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Staff writer Alison Young can be reached at ayoung@ajc.com or 404-526-7372 . <p> * * * <p> FLIGHT FACTS <p> 1 : Number of Gulfstream III jets leased by the CDC for emergency use <p> $3 million : Annual cost of 24-hour access to this jet <p> $3,000 : Additional cost for each hour it 's flown <p> $164,000 : Cost of flight hours used to date in 2006 by CDC employees <p> $720,000 : Cost of flight hours used to date in 2006 by Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt <p> Source : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Department of Health and Human Services <p> * * * <p> Barnstorming for Medicare <p> Last fall , Congress authorized Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt to use the CDC 's jet " in times of emergencies .
