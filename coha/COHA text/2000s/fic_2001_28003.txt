The Opening May 1 Dear Bill , Another summer season is about to begin on beautiful Nantucket Island . I have just returned from my winter retreatNevis , Vail , Saipanit 's your guess where I 've been . The important thing is that I 'm back , and I am prepared to sweeten my offer to buy the hotel . I know you have some crazy idea about family loyalty and passing the business on to your daughter , but things do n't always work out the way we want them to . Alas , I have learned this the hard way . So as you start this season of sun and sand , consider my offer : twenty-two million . That 's a pretty good deal , and if you do n't mind my saying so , you 're not getting any younger . Feel free to write to me at the usual P. O. box downtown . I 'll be waiting to hear from you . As ever , S.B.T. ON THE FIRST OF May , Mack Petersen swung his Jeep into the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his twelfth summer season as manager , the Almost Head Honcho . Twelve was an important number , Mack decided , with its own name . A dozen . Mack 's dozen years of working at the hotel were like eggs , all in one basket , like the Boston cream doughnuts served at the hotel 's Continental breakfast , one practically indistinguishable from the next . There were twelve months in a year , twelve signs in the Zodiac , twelve hours of A.M. and P.M. Twelve was a full cycle , a cycle completed . Maybe Maribel was right , then . Maybe this was the year things would change . Mack walked across the parking lot to look at Nantucket 's most picturesque beach . Over the winter , northeasterly winds blew the sand into smooth , rounded dunes , in some places six and eight feet high . Mack trudged to the top of one of the dunes and gazed out over the water . The Beach Club sat on the north shore of the island , on Nantucket Sound , where the water was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand was clean and wide , although they lost beach to erosion , some years as much as twenty-five feet . Last year they had gained beach and the owner of the hotel , Bill Elliott , was so happy that he had thrown his arm around Mack 's shoulder , and said , " See there ? We 're not going to lose her after all . " As though the Beach Club and Hotel belonged to them both . Which , of course , was not the case . Mack had stayed on Nantucket through the winter with his girlfriend Maribel , but he had n't checked on the hotel even once . It was a rule he 'd created over the years : I wo n't think about the hotel in winter . Were the shingles falling off ? Was the paint peeling ? Were they losing beach ? Those were questions for Bill and his wife , Therese , but they spent their winters skiing in Aspen , and if anyone were going to check on the place , it would be Mack . But he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel would obsess him , drive him crazy . The most photographed part of the hotel was the paviliona covered deck with five blue Adirondack chairs facing the water . All summer , guests sat in the low , wide chairs with their feet up on the railing , drinking coffee , reading the paper . This picture of summer bliss made it into the Nantucket chamber of commerce guide year after year . The lobby of the hotel was its own freestanding building with a row of windows that looked over the pavilion and the beach . The hotel rooms began outside the back door of the lobby : twenty single-story , cedar-shingled rooms formed a giant L. Ten rooms ran down toward the water and ten rooms faced the water . All the rooms had small decks , and thus the rooms were distinguished by the names , " side deck " and " front deck . " Therese had further nicknamed the front deck rooms the " Gold Coast , " because they were so expensive . Twenty rooms might not seem like a lot at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : One hundred members paid annual dues to sit under umbrellas for the ten weeks of summer . They could have saved themselves the money and gone to Steps Beach to the west , or Jetties Beach to the east , but year after year membership of the Beach Club was full . Mack 's primary job was to treat the guests and the Beach Club members like royalty . He arranged dinner reservations and the delivery of flowers , wine , steamed lobsters , birthday cakes . He had a key to every door , and knew the location of every extension cord , vacuum cleaner bag , feather pillow . He hired and fired the staff and created the weekly work schedule . He knew every Beach Club member 's name by heart and the names of all the children . Mack ran the place . Bill and Therese had owned the Beach Club and Hotel for twenty years but Mack understood its ins and outs , its cracks , sore spots , and hideaways better than anyone . It had been his course of study now for twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next six months . Some had been coming to the hotel as long as Mack had worked there . The baseball managers ( in July , over the all-star break ) , Leo Hearn , a lawyer from Chicago ( Memorial Day ) , Mrs. Ford , a widow who came for the month of September and smoked a pack of cigarettes in her room each day . Then there would be Andrea Krane , a woman Mack thought he might be in love with . Andrea arrived in June and stayed for three weeks with her autistic son , James . Mack imagined her long , honey-colored hair twisted into a bun or a braid . Smiling a rare smile , because when she arrived at the Beach Club she was happy . She had three weeks stretched in front of her , twenty-one days sparkling like diamonds on a tennis bracelet . Mack watched the ferry approach in the distance . It was full of people coming to work for the seasonwaiters and waitresses , ice cream scoopers , lifeguards , landscapers , nannies , chambermaids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boathis first time on the oceanand when he stepped off at Steamship Wharf his life changed . Nantucket had saved him . * * * TWELVE YEARS AGO , MACK was eighteen , a farm boy . Born and raised in Swisher , Iowa , where his father owned a 530-acre farmcorn and soybeans , hogs and chickens . The farm had originally belonged to Mack 's grandfather , then his father , and Mack grew up understanding that it would one day be his . School felt like a waste of time , except that it was a place to socialize . Mack loved to talkthe bonus for spending hours on a combine by himself was that his father took him to The Alibi for a greasy ham-and-egg breakfast , or to the feed storeand there was always lots of talk . Mack 's mother worked part-time at an antique store in Swishera quiet job of crystal figurines and classical music . Mack 's parents belonged to Swisher Presbyterian , but they were n't strict about going to church , nor were they prescriptive about what Mack should believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't believe in heaven . " I just do n't believe in it , " she said as she scrubbed potatoes at the sink and Mack puzzled over his trigonometry homework at the long oak harvest table . " I believe that when you die , you die , and you 're back to where you were before you were born . Oblivion , I guess you 'd call it . " Two months before Mack 's high school graduation , his parents went out for their Saturday night dinner date . On their way home on Route 380 , a tractor trailer sideswiped their car and they crashed into the guardrail and died . There had n't been foul weatherno rain , no ice . Only carelessness on the part of the truck driver , and possibly , on the part of Mack 's father , who should have hit the brakes harder when the truck pulled in front of him . ( Had his father been drinking ? A cocktail before dinner , wine ? ) It did n't matter to Mack ; it did n't change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left orphaned , although orphaned was n't a word anyone used , and neither was it a word Mack thought of often . He was , after all , eighteen . An adult . Mack left the farm to his father 's lawyer , David Pringle , and his father 's sidekick Wendell , and the farmhands who worked there . He picked up his high school diploma , caught a bus east and took it as far as it would go , a romantic idea , one his mother would have liked . When the bus stopped in Hyannis , Massachusetts , Mack thought he would find a small apartment and a job , but then he caught his first glimpse of the ocean and he learned there was a boat that would take him even farther east , to an island . Nantucket Island . Mack found his job at the Beach Club by accident . When the ferry pulled in to Steamship Wharf , Bill Elliott stood waiting on the dock , and when Mack stepped off the boat , Bill tapped his shoulder . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill asked . Mack did n't even think about it . " Yes , sir , I am . " He followed Bill to an olive-colored Jeep . Bill hoisted Mack 's duffel into the back and they drove off the wharf and down North Beach Road without another word . When they pulled into the parking lot of the hotel , Mack saw the view of the waterhe was still not used to so much waterand then he heard a hum . Hum . Hum . " What 's that noise ? " Mack asked . " The seagulls ? " Bill said . " They can be pretty loud . Where did you come from ? " " Iowa , " Mack said . Bill 's forehead wrinkled . " I thought you were coming from New Jersey . " It confirmed Mack 's fear : there was some kid from New Jersey standing on the wharf , waiting for Bill to pick him up . " No , sir , I came from Swisher , Iowa . " He heard the noise again . Hum . Hum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't hear that ? " Mack asked . Bill smiled . " I guess you did n't have too many gulls out in Iowa . I guess this is all brand-new . " " Yes , sir , " Mack said . A voice was saying " Home , home . " Mack could hear it as plain as day . He extended his hand . " I 'm Mack Petersen . " Bill frowned . " Mack Petersen was n't who I was picking up . " " I know , " Mack said . " But you asked if I was here for a job , and I am . " " Do you know anything about hotels ? " Bill asked . " I will soon , I guess , " Mack said . And he heard it again ; it was the funniest thing . Home . Mack did n't believe in spiritual guides , past lives , fortune-tellers , tarot cards , or crystal balls . He believed in God and in a heaven , despite what his mother told him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voice was n't coming from the sky , it was coming from the land beneath his feet . Mack had heard the voice at other times over the past twelve years , too many now to count . He read about phenomena like thisthe Taos Hum , the Whisper of Carmelbut never on Nantucket . Mack once found the courage to ask Maribel , " Do you ever hear things on this island ? From this island ? Do you ever hear a voice ? " Maribel blinked her blue eyes , and said , " I do think the island has a voice . It 's the waves , the birds , the whisper of the dune grass . " Mack never mentioned the voice to anyone again . MACK LISTENED FOR THE voice now as he lingered on the dune . Just four days earlier , he 'd received a phone call from David Pringle , the lawyer who 'd supervised the farm in Iowa for all the years since Mack left . David called every now and then urging Mack to rent out the farmhouse , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather . But he had never sounded as serious as he did four days ago . " Wendell gave his notice , " David said . " He 's retiring after harvest . " " Yeah ? " Mack said . Wendell , Mack 's father 's right-hand man , had been in charge since Mack left . " I told you this was in the future , Mack . I told you to do some thinking . " " You did , " Mack said . " You surely did . " " But you have n't done the thinking . " " No , " Mack said . " Not really . " When had Mack last talked to David ? Last November after harvest ? A Christmas card ? Mack could n't remember . He only vaguely recalled a conversation about Wendell getting ready to leave . " We need someone to run things , " David said . " Hire one of the other hands to do it , " Mack said . " I trust your judgment , David . " David sighed into the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer than anybody Mack had met on the East Coast , where even men who were n't lawyers acted like lawyers . " Since the Oral B plant opened , we 've lost a lot of help , " David said . " We have n't had a hand here longer than six months . You want me to put a transient like that in charge of your father 's farm ? " " Are they all transients ? Are n't there a couple of hardworking kids , looking for a chance ? " " Wendell and I do n't think so , " David said . " We 've talked about it . If your little love affair with that island is n't over , Mack , I mean , if you 're going to stick it out in the East , then Wendell and I agree it 's time to put the farm up . " " For sale , you mean ? " David hummed into the phone . " Mmmm-hmm . " " I do n't think I can do that , " Mack said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David said . " If you 're not going to sell it , then you ought to come home and do the job yourself . You 've been out there a long time . " " Twelve years , " Mack said . " Twelve years . " Mack could practically see David shaking his head in disbelief . " Your decision , but this is what your father left you . I 'd rather see you sell it than let it fall to pieces . " " Okay , " Mack said . " So I 'll talk to you in a couple of months , then ? " " I 'll be in touch , " David said . MACK COULD N'T IMAGINE SELLING his family 's farm but neither could he imagine leaving Nantucket . The farm was the last place he 'd kissed his mother 's cheek , he was born and raised there , and worked side by side with his father . Sell the farm ? Leave Nantucket ? An impossible decision . Twelve years later , Mack did n't know where his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dune , he listened ; he wanted the voice to tell him what to do . MAY FIRST WAS BILL Elliott 's least favorite day of the year ; it was one of the few mornings that he did n't make love to his wife , Therese . May first was Therese 's day to sleep in undisturbed while Bill tried not to panic . The doctor told him panic was bad for his heart ; stress of any kind could take months off his life . ( Bill noted the use of that word , " months , " and it terrified him . His life had been pared down to increments of thirty days . ) At dawn , he left his house for a walk along Hulbert Avenue . The summer homes on Hulbert were boarded up , Bill was relieved to see ; it looked as if the houses were sleeping . So there was still plenty of time to whip the hotel into shape . The reservation book filled up by the Ides of March , but taking reservations was the easy part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all the work that had to be done . The enormous , rounded dunes of the beach . Twenty rooms with furniture piled on top of the beds , draped with white sheets . Dusty , disorganized . Bill reached home , wheezing . He was sixty years old and because of his weak heart , already an old man . This past winter in Aspen , he had n't been able to ski the black diamonds , nor the blues ; he had been embarrassingly limited to the gentle green slopes of Buttermilk Mountain . His hair was the color of nickels and dimes , his knees ached in the evenings , and he needed good light for reading . Last week on the flight back from Aspen , he used the lavatory four times . But the kicker was this : Just after the New Year , he and Therese were out at Guido 's with another couple , a doctor ( though not Bill 's doctor ) and his wife , eating cheese fondue when Bill felt pressure in his chest , a squeezing , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor at the table took charge of calling an ambulance . There was talk of choppering Bill to Denver , but thankfully , that was n't necessary , and in the end , Bill was okay . It had n't been a heart attack , just angina , heart muscle pain , a warning . The doctor recommended retirement . A few years ago , last year even , this would have been unthinkable , but now it sounded tempting . Bill 's daughter , Cecily , would be graduating from high school in a couple of weeks and she 'd already passed her eighteenth birthday . So it was only a matter of time before he could leave the running of the hotel to Cecily . As Bill opened his front door , a white envelope fluttered to his feet . The letters had begun ! Bill tore the envelope open and read the letteras ever , from the mysterious S.B.T. , an offer to buy the hotel out from under Bill 's feet . Good old S.B.T. had been writing letters for several years now trying to convince Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , S.B.T. , Bill thought . Bill occasionally wrote back to the post office boxhe 'd never met the man ( or woman ) and they would n't offer a name at the post office when Bill inquired . There were n't any S. B. T 's in the phone book ; for all Bill knew , the initials were fabricated . The mysteriousness of it was both frustrating and intriguing , like having a secret suitor . A suitor , at his age ! Bill crumpled the letter and deposited it into the trash can at the side of his house . Are you watching , S.B.T. ? Are you watching ? When Bill reached the kitchen and poured his first cup of decaf , he heard a car pull into the parking lot , and the tightness in his chest alleviated a bit . Mack . Bill was so happy that he wanted to shout to Therese , Honey , Mack 's here ! He interrupted more than a few of her May first slumbers this way . But this time Bill was quiet . He closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening " to himself , like a prayer . And miles to go before I sleep . It was amazing the way the words came to him . After the episode at the restaurant , Bill had retreated into poetry , into the words of an old man , a New Englander . Never mind that Frost 's Vermont was a far cry from this island ( there was n't a single tree on Bill 's whole property ) . Never mind that . For reasons unexplainable , Frost 's poetry helped ; it was a balm , a salve . It eased Bill 's aging soul . Mack looked exactly the same : the ruddy , smiling face and that bushy head of light brown hair . Bill knew Mack as well as he might have known a son . Bill shook Mack 's hand and he could n't stop himself from hugging him too . " So , " Bill said , " you decided to come back . " This was their longstanding joke . Mack never said he would return in May , and Bill never asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot and each time , Bill greeted him this way . Bill wanted to say something else ; he wanted to say " Thank you for coming back , " but he did n't . It would embarrass Mack , and it might be better if Mack did n't know how much Bill needed him . " How was your winter ? " " Not bad . I worked for Casey Miller on a huge project in Cisco . It snowed twice and both times I got the day off and went sledding . " " How 's Maribel ? " Bill asked . " The same , " Mack said . " They love her at the library . And at the post office and the bank , and Stop &; Shop . She knows everyone . It 's like walking around with the mayor . " " She 's hankering to get married ? " Bill asked . " I can hardly blame her , " Mack said . " We 've been together a long time . " " So is this it , then ? Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill could see he was embarrassed now , by just this . Bill clapped him on the shoulder . " How about we give this place the once-over , for starters ? " Mack looked relieved . " Okay , " he said . THERE WAS NO WAY Bill Elliott could look at his hotel objectively ; it was as familiar to him and well loved as the face of his wife . Always on May first the hotel looked formidable and tough , boarded up like an old western ghost town , and today was no exception . The hotel had gray cedar shingles like nearly every building on Nantucket . Plywood had been fastened over her doors and windows , paint peeled from her frames . Bill pictured the hotel at the height of summer ; it was the only way he could keep his blood pressure from skyrocketing . Her trim would be as white as fresh eggs , her windows sparkling , Therese 's geraniums and impatiens in full bloomred , white , pink . The water temperature at sixty-eight degrees , the skies clear with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beach umbrellas . Who could complain then ? Still , even today , Bill was in love with what he saw . Despite the shutters and the peeling paint and the undulating beach , she was the most beautiful hotel in the world . He would no sooner sell it than cut out his own heart . Bill and Mack walked along the side deck rooms and took a left by the front deck rooms . Room 21 through room 1 , skipping a room 13 , of course . All present and accounted for , although Bill had nightmares during the winter of the rooms flying away in a northeaster like something from The Wizard of Oz . Bill stepped up onto each deck and stamped his feet to check for rotting boards . Mack perused the roof for missing shingles and inspected the shutters for leaks . " She 's tight , " Mack said . They headed back across the beach to the parking lot and Bill took keys out of his pocket . He unlocked the doors to the lobby and they stepped in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , brother , " Mack said . " Are you ready ? " Bill said . He wished Mack looked more confident , more eager . Maybe this winter had taken a toll . " I 'm going to shower and change , " he said . " And you can get started . We have a hotel to run . " THE BEACH CLUB WAS Therese Elliott 's canvas , her block of clay . Every May presented the same challengeto make the hotel look more glorious than the year before . Therese had embarked on the quest for beauty when she was a girl growing up on Long Islandin Bilbo , perhaps the most unattractive town in all of America . Therese 's family lived in one of the first subdivisions , on a cul-de-sac where the houses were built in three styles : ranch , split-level , and bastardized saltbox . Her parents ' house ( from the age of ten she referred to it as her parents ' house , never her own ) was a ranch with plasterboard walls , white Formica countertops threaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a swatch of green lawn and a chain-link fence that marked the property line along the sides and the back . Now that Therese was in the hotel business , she compared the neighborhood where she grew up to a Holiday Innevery living space alike in its absolute sterility , in its absence of charm . As an adolescent she felt bewildered walking home from school past the identical houses and identical yards , realizing that for some reason people chose to live like thiswithout distinction , without beauty . Her neighborhood could n't even be called ugly , because ugly might at least have been interesting . The best word to describe the neighborhood of Therese 's childhood was unliterary . She could n't imagine anything noteworthy or romantic happening among the white-and-black , gold-threaded Formica-ness of the place . And so , at eighteen , she left . For Manhattan , with its color and confusion , beauty and ugliness side by side . She flunked out of Hunter College after two semesters , because instead of studying she spent hours walking through Chinatown , Chelsea , Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When her parents received her poor grades , they insisted she return to Bilbo and enroll at Katie Gibbs , but she refused . She found a job waitressing at a German restaurant on Eighty-sixth and York , where fat old men admired the color of her hair and gave her generous tips . She saved enough money to leave the city for the summer with a girlfriend whose family had a beach house on Nantucket . Nantucket cornered the market on beautythe tumbling south shore waves , blue herons standing one-legged in Coskata Pond , Great Point Lighthouse at sunset . Therese took a job as a chambermaid at the Jared Coffin House in town , and when summer turned into fall and her girlfriend returned to the city , Therese stayed . More than thirty years later , she loved it still . She had married a local boy , given birth to two children , one who died and one who lived , and she and Bill transformed the Beach Club into a hotel . A beautiful place where love flourished . Bill and Therese lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The first floor had two spacious bedroomsone for their daughter , Cecily , and one for the baby that died . The second floor had a rounded bay window that overlooked the hotel , the beach , and the sound . Therese stood at the window on this first day of May , but all she could see was a reflection of herself . It was a bad , vain habit , catching glances of herself in mirrors and windows , in the glass of picture frames , but she could n't keep from looking . What did she see ? At the age of fifty-eight , she still fit into a silk skirt she bought before Cecily was born . Her hair was the color of ripe peaches , with one streak of pure white in front that appeared after she gave birth to her dead baby . Her mark of strength and wisdom , of Motherhood . Above anything , Therese was a Wife and a Mother . But now her family was in danger of falling apart . Her husband suffered from heart problems and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , Therese pictured herself abandoned , alone . Bill dying , Cecily going away , until there would be nothing in her life except her own reflection . She had to force herself away from the window and down into the hotel lobby . When she flung open the doors , her spirits lifted . Mack crawled around on the exposed beams of the lobby , wiping them down with a damp rag . Mack in the rafters : it was a sure sign of spring . " You got to work before I could hug and kiss you , " she said . " You got to work before I could tell you what to do . " Mack swung around and sat with his legs dangling . " I already know what to do , " he said . " I 'm not exactly new here . " Therese flopped onto a sofa that was covered with one of the hotel 's sheets and put her feet on a dusty sea captain 's chest . " You could run this place alone , I suppose . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She had known Mack for twelve years and he was closer to her than anyone except for Bill and Cecily . She could tell him just about anything . " You sound so melancholy , " Mack said . " Where 's the uptight woman I know and love ? What happened to the never-ending pursuit of cleanliness ? " " I 'm worried about Bill , " she said . " He had heart problems this winter . Did he tell you ? " " No , " Mack said . " What kind of problems ? " It was comforting to hear a voice from above . " Problems that happen when people get older , " Therese said . " His doctor told him he could only ski the baby slopes . It was n't a good winter for Bill . " " He looks okay , " Mack said . " A little pale , maybe , but okay . And his spirit 's up . " " You think so ? " Therese was concerned about Bill 's preoccupation with Robert Frosthe 'd taken it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reading and reciting seemed to help him . " How 's Cecily doing ? " Mack asked . " She does n't know about her father 's heart , " Therese said . " That 's one nice thing about having her away at school . She does n't have to worry . And since she 's not worrying , she 's doing quite well . " " She wrote a letter at Christmas telling me about some Brazilian guy she met and I have n't heard from her since , " Mack said . " Is she going to graduate or did she run away to Rio ? " The Brazilian boyfriend , Gabriel , another stumbling block . But Cecily had barely mentioned him the last two times she called home , and Therese hoped that with the end of the school year in sight , her infatuation was petering out . " Believe it or not , she 's going to graduate . " " And college ? " Mack asked . " The University of Virginia . Hard enough to get into that she impressed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're thrilled . " " She 'll be on the front desk this summer ? She 's more than capable , Therese . If she 's going to run the hotel someday she needs to learn it . " " Not the desk , " Therese said firmly . Mack rolled his eyes . He could think what he wanted , that Therese babied her daughter , but Cecily was still a child . She did n't need a job that could drive even a mature , well-adjusted adult insane . " Bill hired a woman to work the day desk , someone he met at the gym in Aspen . Her name is Love . " " Love ? " " Yes , " said Therese . " We need more love around here . Speaking of which , you noticed I have n't asked about your girlfriend . " " I did n't expect you to , " Mack said . " I ca n't resist . How are things ? Are you still together ? Still happy ? " " Yes . " " Still happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We have no plans to get married , no , " he said . " Wait until you see Cecily , " Therese said . " All grown up . A woman . And so gorgeous . Vibrant . Irresistible . " And headstrong , opinionated , difficult , her Cecily . Therese lifted her feet from the dusty chest and stood up . " If you marry Cecily this will all be yours . Bill would be so relieved . He loves you like a son , you know . He really does . " " You make it sound like we 're living in a fairy tale , " Mack said . " If I marry the fair daughter , I get the whole kingdom . " " You could rule the Beach Club kingdom . " " I 'm not marrying Cecily , Therese . " " Well , you 're not marrying Maribel . " Therese and Mack had this same conversation every year , and she knew it irked Mack , but Therese could n't help herself . To her , only one course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them taking over where Bill and Therese left off . She also knew that people rarely did what made sense . " I have n't decided about marriage at all yet , " Mack said . " But I can tell you , if and when I do get married , it wo n't be to Cecily . And if you do n't believe me , ask her . She 'd rather eat glass , direct quote . " " I wo n't give up , " Therese said . She caught her reflection in a tarnished mirror , and then she pulled out her artist 's tools from the utility closetvacuum , bucket , cleanser , and her feather dusterand started to work . MARIBEL COX KNEW SHE was the subject of gossipamong her mother 's friends at the Christian Calendar Factory , among her colleagues at the library , among Mack 's co-workers and Bill and Therese down at the Beach Club . She knew they were all whispering , " When are Mack and Maribel going to do the right thing ? When are they going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : Maribel wanted to get married with a raging , fiery passion , but the only person who knew it was Maribel 's mother , Tina .

" Every Wednesday night , Maribel said , " Well , nothing . " And her mother said , " Keep the faith . " Maribel and Mack had been dating for six years , living together for three . Maribel had found a man Afraid to Commit . " Like mother , like daughter , " Tina said . Maribel pictured her mother : twenty pounds overweight , permed hair , smoking a cigarette as she talked on the phone . Tina herself had never been married . She met Maribel 's father at an outdoor concert , and Maribel was conceived in the woods nearby , up against a tree . Her mother never saw the man again ; she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anything like you , " Tina was fond of saying , " he must be a great guy . " Maribel loved her mother dearly , although this love was tinged with shame and pity . Tina worked as a supervisor at the Christian calendar factory in Unadilla , New York . Her mother did n't belong to a church , and yet spending all day around Christian calendars , she picked up certain phrases : " Keep the faith , " and " Godspeed , " and " We are all His little lambs . " It had always been just Tina and Maribel ; there was never anyone to help them out , no man in Maribel 's life growing up . Mack lost his parents in a car accident and Maribel tried to believe this was the same thing as her not having a father , but in fact , it was vastly different . When Maribel thought of her father , there was no one to picture . She was left with an empty spot inside , a part of her missing . A hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father . " Remember , Mama , remember everything you can . " Tina sucked on her cigarette and closed her eyes : His name was Stephen , he had sweet , chocolaty breath and a pencil-line scar above his eyebrow . I remember the scratch of bark against my back . It was getting dark , the sky turning pink and lavender through the trees . I did n't know your father real well . But when I was with him , I had a feeling something good would come of it . Maribel wanted to get married for two peopleherself and her mother . She wanted Mack to take care of them , the way Stephen might have . Mack made just as many comments about the future as Maribel did , if not more . There was no doubt in Maribel 's mind that Mack wanted to spend the rest of his life with her . He loved her . So what , then , was the problem ? After years of taking self-help books off the shelves at the library , Maribel drew a conclusion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he received from David Pringle last week proved it . Mack owned a huge farm in Iowa , but he did n't want to go back and run it and he did n't want to sell it . Both options involved too much commitment , too much responsibility . It was as though he wanted the farm to exist on its own , magically , a farm from a dream , while he stayed on Nantucket and ran the stupid hotel . At any minute , Bill Elliott could drop dead and the hotel would go to Cecily , and Mack would be out of luck . But Mack loved his job at the hotelsix months on , six months off , never telling Bill if he were coming back or notbecause it gave him freedom . Because he did n't have to take itor anything elsetoo seriously . In Maribel 's opinion , Mack needed to ask Bill Elliott to profit-share . Thirty percent of the hotel 's profit should go to Mack each year . Many of the guests who took Mack and Maribel out to dinner admitted ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job , they would stop coming . The hotel was lovely , they said ( but expensive , and the rates went up every year ) ; it was the service that kept them coming back . It was walking into the lobby and having Mack there with his cheerful , booming voice , " Hel-lo , Mr. Page ! Welcome back . How was your winter ? " It was Mack who picked up the Page children and swung them around while he complimented Mrs. Page on her new haircut . And that was what people paid for . They wanted to be coddled ; they wanted to be courted . Maribel was convinced profit sharing was the answer . If Mack profit-shared , he would take his job seriously . He would take his life seriously . He could afford to hire someone really qualified to run the farm . His house would be in order . He would propose . And the empty spot inside of Maribel would shrivel , shrink , disappear . ( Continues ... )          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
