" Now that we 're going to be colleagues , Doctor , I hope we can put the past behind us , " said Jason Carmichael . Green ice , that 's what had formed his eyes in some glacial age when Neanderthals stalked the world , Heather thought . In this case , the Neanderthal had a degree from Harvard Medical School , short dark hair and a lean build beneath his expensive business suit . His collected manner failed to assuage her opinion that he was a semi-savage male who probably ate his steak sandwiches raw . " As far as I 'm concerned , there is no past , " Heather told the new head of the Infertility Clinic . The latest addition to the Doctors Circle complex , the clinic was in the final stages of remodeling and would open officially in April , two months from now . Jason had arrived earlier this week but had been so busy that , until now , he and Heather had exchanged only brief , impersonal greetings . She wished they could keep it that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rumors had spread about her supposed dislike of him . They 'd been right . Some fellow staffersattributed Heather 's attitude to professional jealousy . Since she 'd worked as an obstetrician at Doctors Circle for three years and had handled most of the infertility cases , she might have expected to be promoted to the post . Others guessed that there was some personal conflict in their backgrounds . No one knew the truth , that she 'd nearly made love to this man more than a year ago after meeting him at a convention . What a disaster that had been ! Heather had n't confided the story even to the few friends with whom she 'd shared her other secret , that she 'd given up a baby for adoption when she was fifteen . Although her daughter had reappeared in her life and , along with a baby granddaughter , was now very dear to her , Heather saw no reason to spread that information around Doctors Circle . In her opinion , the more private she kept her life , the better . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected a reply by now . " " I 'm not sure . Which email was that ? " " I 've only sent one . " " Then no , I have n't seen it , " Heather said . Jason gritted his teeth . " I do n't see how you could have missed it . I sent it twice . " " I 'm sure it 's in the queue . " She gestured at the computer screen that dominated the scattering of files and medication samples on her desk . " I clear it every Friday . " Today was Wednesday . Annoyance twisted his mouth . " You 'll find I 'm a stickler for organization , Doctor . That includes keeping up with your messages . " " I 'm a stickler for being on time with my patients , even when that leaves me with a messy desk . " Heather checked her watch . " Why do n't you simply tell me what the message said ? And why do n't we drop this ' doctor ' nonsense and call each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jason was n't accustomed to being addressed so cavalierly . He 'd better get used to it . People in Serene Beach , California , did n't stand on ceremony . Especially her . " Very well , Heather . " He emphasized her name . " I wrote to suggest that you and I walk through the new facility , unfinished as it is . I 'd like to consult you about our planning . " A blush heated her cheeks . With her short mop of red curls and sprinkle of freckles , Heather colored easily when embarrassed . And she was embarrassed . She 'd been giving Jason a hard time when all he 'd wanted was to discuss the plans for the clinic . Although she hated paperwork and therefore had n't coveted the post of department head , she did want a say in how they set up staffing and scheduling . So far , the two of them were the only doctors assigned to the clinic , although others would be arriving soon . His request was an appropriate professional courtesy . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you then , " she said . " Would that work ? " " Certainly . " Jason cleared his throat . " Listen , that is n't the only thing I wanted to discuss . We have some unfinished business to clear up . " Uh-oh . " Which business would that be ? " " Atlanta , " he said . Heather definitely did not want to discuss the medical convention in Georgia where they 'd met some fifteen months earlier . That unpleasant experience was best consigned to the scrap heap of memories . What on earth had possessed her to go up to his room and throw her inhibitions out the window ? Thank goodness he 'd fallen asleep before they could consummate a passion that , in retrospect , struck her as incomprehensible . His crankiness the following day had made it evident what a close call she 'd had . " That business is finished . You dotted the i 's and crossed the t 's very succinctly the next morning . " She closed the file she 'd been reviewing . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she had n't known him better , it might have sounded like an apology . " Being hungover is no excuse for rudeness . " " I can be difficult when I have a headache , " he said . " Who is n't ? " " You must get a lot of headaches . You 're famous for your curt manner . " Heather lifted her coffee cup , discovered that it was empty and set it down again . " You reduced your secretary to tears yesterday , I heard . " Usually , the efficiency of the grapevine at Doctors Circle drove Heather crazy . Once in a while , however , it came in handy . " I did n't expect her to react so strongly . " Jason ducked his head , and a well-shaped head it was , too , for a Neanderthal , she reluctantly conceded . " By the time I arrived , Coral had already unpacked all my files from Virginia . I suppose I overreacted , but she 'll have to repack everything when we move across the courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who requested a secretary be hired before you got here . In any case , you could have sent her instructions , since you 're obviously a whiz with email . " Heather got to her feet . " I assumed she would liaise with my secretary in Virginia , " Jason said . Heather decided it would be impolitic to mention how much she hated trendy words like liaise . " Coral 's new and I am sure she was trying to make a good impression . " ( Continues ... )
