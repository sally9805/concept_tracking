Chapter One When Tess Newhart threw open her apartment door , Nick Jamieson was standing there - tall , dark , successful and suspiciously happy to see her , his pleasantly blunt face a nice human contrast to his perfectly tailored suit . She stared at him warily , fighting down the ridiculous jolt of relief , happiness , and lust that welled up in her just because he was back . Then he threw his arms wide to hug her . " Tess ! " he said , beaming at her . " You look great ! " Tess looked down at her sagging , bleach-splotched sweats . So much for relief , happiness and lust . She rolled her eyes at him , all her suspicions confirmed . " Right . " She slammed the door in his face and shot home both dead bolts . " Aw , come on , Tess , " Nick called through the door . " It 's been a month . Actually it 's been a month , a week and two days , but who 's counting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I keep calling but you wo n't call me back . Is that fair ? I think we should talk about this . " " I do n't , " Tess said firmly to the door , but she ran her fingers through her short red curls . If Nick had n't had such a large streak of calculating rat running through him , he would have been just what she needed at the moment , instead of the last thing she needed . But there was that streak of rat , and if he was at her door being charming it was because he wanted something . And the something probably was n't her . It was something to do with money , promotion , status or all of the above . She shook her head and turned back to cross the threadbare gray carpet to her chair and her conversation . " Who 's the wise guy ? Your landlord ? " Gina DeCosta sprawled on Tess 's lumpy couch , her unruly black hair falling into her eyes , her small body lost in a huge black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight as Ace bandages . She stretched out tentatively and winced . " Worse . " Tess flopped down into her decrepit armchair , which groaned under her weight , and slung her long legs over the side . " You know , every time I think my life has hit bottom , somebody lowers the bottom . " Nick pounded on the door . " Come on , Tess . Open up . " " Who is that guy ? " Gina said . " Nick , but I do n't want to talk about it . Between him and my landlord , I may never open that door again . " Tess patted her lap , and a huge black cat jumped into her arms , reclaiming the territory she 'd lost when Tess had gone to answer the door . " Sorry , Angela , " Tess murmured to the cat . " Tess ? " Nick called . " Come on . Let 's be adult about this . Or you can be adult and I 'll fake it . Tess ? " Gina frowned at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well . " Tess thought for a minute . " It 's like this . " She stood up , dumping the cat off her lap again . " I answered the door and he said - " she flung her arms wide and beamed a toothpaste smile at Gina " - Tess , you look great ! " Gina looked at Tess 's sweats . " Uh-oh . " " Exactly . " Tess flopped back into her chair . " You know , every time I see Nick , my mind looks at him and says , ' Yes , he 's fun , but he 's also a power-hungry rat , so stay away from him , ' and then my body looks at him and says , ' Hello , gorgeous , come to Mama . " ' She shook her head . " I have to have a long talk with my body . " Gina looked at the sweats again . " I do n't think it 's gon na listen to you . If you dressed me like that , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tess said . " You 're starting to sound like Nick . " " Okay . New topic . Why are you waiting for your landlord ? " " I reported him to the housing commission . " Tess smiled , cheered up by the thought . " Well , that was unfriendly , " Gina said . " What did he do ? " " It 's what he did n't do . " Tess shifted in her chair as she warmed to the story of her landlord 's crimes . " Three apartments in this building have been vandalized in the past two months , and Ray wo n't even fix the lock on the hall door . Anybody can walk in here . Somebody had to do something . " She grinned at Gina . " And , I thought , who better than me ? " " Tess ? " Nick called again . " It 's not safe out here . If I get mugged because you 're playing hard to get , you 'll never forgive yourself . " Both women turned to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tess shrugged . " Okay , " Gina said , abandoning the subject of Nick . " So you did something . That 's no big surprise . I 'm just amazed you did something as calm as reporting him . " " Well , I thought about organizing a candlelightvigil protest march , " Tess said , starting to grin again . " I thought all the tenants could light candles and march on Ray 's condominium , but this place is such a firetrap I knew we 'd never make it to the front door alive , so then I thought about using Bic lighters , instead , but that made me think of Stanley across the hall . " " Stanley ? " " You 've never seen Stanley ? " Tess 's grin widened . " Stanley always wears the same T-shirt and it does n't cover his tummy , and Stanley 's tummy is not attractive . In fact , Stanley 's stomach is the only one I 've ever seen with a five-o'clock shadow . " She frowned at Gina . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's gross . " " I think so , too , which is why I could n't picture Stanley with a Bic . A torch , yes . A Bic , no . " Tess smiled again . " But then I thought , why not give Stanley a pitchfork and put him at the head of the march ? " She stopped to visualize it . " You know , there 's a lot of Quasimodo in Stanley . " " Come on , Tess , cut me a break here , " Nick called . " I came back to apologize . Does n't that count for something ? " Gina raised an eyebrow at Tess , but Tess shook her head , so Gina returned to Stanley . " I do n't think Quasimodo had a pitchfork , " she said . " He did n't in the movie . " " Anyway , I finally had to get serious before somebody around here got hurt , " Tess said . " So I acted like an adult and filed the report . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pitchforking Ray the landlord would probably have been bad for your career . " " Well , actually my career is sort of dead right now . " Tess slumped down in her chair . " I was n't going to tell you since this is your first night back from the tour and I was looking forward to one night without trauma , but ... I lost my job . " " Oh , no . " Gina sat up , her face bleak with sympathy and concern . " What happened ? " " Do n't panic , " Tess said from the depths of her chair . " I have a plan . " " Sure you do , " Gina said . " What happened ? " " Funding cuts . The education governor we elected decided that supporting private-tutoring foundations was n't educational . So now the Foundation is going to have to only use volunteers . Eventually the whole place may go . " ( Continues ... )                 @ @ @ @
