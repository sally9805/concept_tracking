SILENCE . <p> The woods around Lake Mondac were as quiet as couldbe , a world of difference from the churning , chaotic city where the couple spent their weekdays . <p> Silence , broken only by an occasional a-hoo-ah of a distant bird , the hollow siren of a frog . <p> And now : another sound . <p> A shuffle of leaves , two impatient snaps of branch or twig . <p> Footsteps ? <p> No , that could n't be . The other vacation houses beside the lake weredeserted on this cool Friday afternoon in April . <p> Emma Feldman , in her early thirties , set down her martini on the kitchen table , where she sat across from her husband . She tucked a strand of curly black hair behind her ear and walked to one of the grimy kitchen windows . She saw nothing but dense clusters of cedar , juniper and black spruce rising up a steep hill , whose rocks resembled cracked yellow bone . <p> Her husband lifted an eyebrow . " What was it ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Did n't see anything . " <p> Outside , silence again . <p> Emma , lean as any stark , white birch outside one of the many windows of the vacation house , shook off her blue jacket . She was wearing the matching skirt and a white blouse . Lawyer clothes . Hair in a bun . Lawyer hair . Stockings but shoeless . <p> Steven , turning his attention to the bar , had abandoned his jacket as well , and a wrinkled striped tie . The thirty-six-year-old , with a full head of unruly hair , was in a blue shirt and his belly protruded inexorably over the belt of his navy slacks . Emma didn'tcare ; she thought he was cute and always would . <p> " And look what I got , " he said , nodding toward the upstairs guest room and unbagging a large bottle of pulpy organic vegetable juice . Their friend , visiting from Chicago this weekend , had been flirting with liquid diets lately , drinking the most disgusting things . <p> Emma read the ingredients and wrinkled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with vodka . " <p> " Why I love you . " <p> The house creaked , as it often did . The place was seventy-six years old . It featured an abundance of wood and a scarcity of steel and stone . The kitchen , where they stood , was angular and paneled in glowing yellow pine . The floor was lumpy . The colonial structure was one of three houses on this private road , each squatting on ten acres . It couldbe called lakefront property but only because the lake lapped at a rocky shore two hundred yards from the front door . <p> The house was plopped down in a small clearing on the east side of a substantial elevation . Midwest reserve kept peoplefrom labeling these hills " mountains " here in Wisconsin , though it rose easily seven or eight hundred feet into the air . At the moment the big house was bathed in blue late-afternoon shadows . <p> Emma gazed out at rippling Lake Mondac , far enough from the hill to catch some descending sun . Now , in early spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hackles rising from a guard dog 's back . The house was much nicer than they couldotherwise afford  --  they 'd bought it through foreclosure  --  and she knew from the moment she 'd seen it that this was the perfect vacation house . <p> Silence ... <p> The colonial also had a pretty colorful history . <p> The owner of a big meatpacking company in Chicago had built the place before World War II . It was discovered years later that much of his fortune had come from selling black-market meat , circumventing the rationing system that limited foods here at home to make sure the troops were nourished . In 1956 the man 's body was found floating in the lake ; he was possibly the victim of veterans who had learned of his scheme and killed him , then searched the house , looking for the illicit cash he 'd hidden here . <p> No ghosts figured in any version of the death , though Emma and Steven could n't keep from embellishing . When guests were staying here they 'd gleefully take note of who kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tales . <p> Two more snaps outside . Then a third . <p> Emma frowned . " You hear that ? Again , that sound . Outside . " <p> Steven glanced out the window . The breeze kicked up now and then . He turned back . <p> Her eyes strayed to her briefcase . <p> " Caught that , " he said , chiding . <p> " What ? " <p> " Do n't even think about opening it . " <p> She laughed , though without much humor . <p> " Work-free weekend , " he said . " We agreed . " <p> " And what 's in there ? " she asked , nodding at the backpack he carried in lieu of an attachT case . Emma was wrestling the lid off a jar of cocktail olives . <p> " Only two things of relevance , Your Honor : my le CarrT novel and that bottle of Merlot I had at work . Shall I introduce the latter into evid ... " Voice fading . He looked to the window , through which they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks the color of dinosaur bones . <p> Emma too glanced outside . <p> " That I heard , " he said . He refreshed his wife 's martini . She dropped olives into both drinks . <p> " What was it ? " <p> " Remember that bear ? " <p> " He didn'tcome up to the house . " They clinked glasses and sipped clear liquor . <p> Steven said , " You seem preoccupied . What 's up , the union case ? " <p> Research for a corporate acquisition had revealed some possible shenanigans within the lakefront workers union in Milwaukee . The government had become involved and the acquisition was temporarily tabled , which nobody was very happy about . <p> But she said , " This 's something else . One of our clients makes car parts . " <p> " Right . Kenosha Auto . See ? I do listen . " <p> She looked at her husband with an astonished glance . " Well , the CEO , turns out , is an absolute prick . " She explained about a wrongful death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freak accident , a passenger electrocuted . " The head of their R-and-D department ... why , he demanded I return all the technical files . Imagine that . " <p> Steven said , " I liked your other case better  --  that state representative 's last will and testament ... the sex stuff . " <p> " Shhhh , " she said , alarmed . " Remember , I never said a word about it . " <p> " My lips are sealed . " <p> Emma speared an olive and ate it . " And how was your day ? " <p> Steven laughed . " Please ... I do n't make enough to talk about business after hours . " The Feldmans were a shining example of a blind date gone right , despite the odds . Emma , a U of W law school valedictorian , daughter of Milwaukee-Chicago money ; Steven , a city college bachelor of arts grad from the Brewline , intent on helping society . Their friends gave them six months , tops ; the Door County wedding , to which all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first date . <p> Steven pulled a triangle of Brie out of a shopping bag . Found crackers and opened them . <p> " Oh , okay . Just a little . " <p> Snap , snap ... <p> Her husband frowned . Emma said , " Honey , it 's freaking me a little . That was footsteps . " <p> The three vacation houses here were eight or nine miles from the nearest shop or gas station and a little over a mile from the county highway , which was accessed via a strip of dirt poorly impersonating a road . Marquette State Park , the biggest in the Wisconsin system , swallowed most of the land in the area ; Lake Mondac and these houses made up an enclave of private property . <p> Very private . <p> And very deserted . <p> Steven walked into the utility room , pulled aside the limp beige curtain and gazed past a cut-back crepe myrtle into the side yard . " Nothing . I 'm thinking we  --  " <p> Emma screamed . <p> " Honey , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied them through the back window . The man 's head was covered with a stocking , though you could see crew-cut , blondish hair , a colorful tattoo on his neck . The eyes were halfway surprised to see peopleso close . He wore an olive drab combat jacket . He knocked on the glass with one hand . In the other he was holding a shotgun , muzzle up . He was smiling eerily . <p> " Oh , God , " Emma whispered . <p> Steven pulled out his cell phone , flipped it open and punched numbers , telling her , " I 'll deal with him . Go lock the front door . " <p> Emma ran to the entryway , dropping her glass . The olives spun amid the dancing shards , picking up dust . Crying out , she heard the kitchen door splinter inward . She looked back and saw the intruder with the shotgun rip the phone from her husband 's hand and shove him against the wall . A print of an old sepia landscape photograph crashed to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , his head also covered with mesh , pushed inside . He had long dark hair , pressed close by the nylon . Taller and stockier than the first , he held a pistol . The black gun was small in his outsized hand . He pushed Emma into the kitchen , where the other man tossed him the cell phone . The bigger one stiffened at the pitch , but caught the phone one-handed . He seemed to grimace in irritation at the toss and dropped the phone in his pocket . <p> Steven said , " Please ... What do you ... ? " Voice quavering . <p> Emma looked away quickly . The less she saw , she was thinking , the better their chances to survive . <p> " Please , " Steven said , " Please . You can take whatever you want . Just leave us . Please . " <p> Emma stared at the dark pistol in the taller man 's hand . He wore a black leather jacket and boots . His were like the other man 's , the kind soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked around the house . <p> Emma 's husband continued , " Look , you can have whatever you want .

Debit card too . I 'll give you the PIN . " <p> " What do you want ? " Emma asked , crying . <p> " Shhh . " <p> Somewhere , in its ancient heart , the house creaked once more . <p> Copyright 2008 by Jeffery Deaver <br> Continues ...
