Chapter FiveMystery child still unidentified . A lot of papers picked up the story . The picture she saw was a later one of me sitting on the front counter of the police station in Las Vegas . Looking a little fatter . Happier . Holding Cookie but still not talking . They guessed my age to be six or seven . I was eleven and a half . The mother never could stand seeing an error in a newspaper . Maybe she called because of that . She thought long and hard about what to do . Dr. Cush gave the mother a little something to help her get started elsewhere . Not much . Not nearly enough . But she took it , bought a sky blue Rambler American , packed up Julie and did n't look back . Do they remember us there anymore ? The family that became unhinged and blew away ? I have wondered too why the mother decided to make the identifying call . Maybe she was afraid of what I would say if I finally started talking . How I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved me into the backseat of his car in the middle of the night . Her who piled the clothes on top of me and said if I said one single word , if I made a peep to let him know I was back there , she would pull my eyes out . Or maybe she called because she could not stand to see me getting all of the publicity . She had always wanted her picture in the newspaper . Maybe she just could not stand the thought of me hogging all the action . In the little teeny grease spot on the map where I was born the name Rohbeson meant quality meat . Rohbeson 's Slaughter and Custom House was famous for five counties . Rohbeson 's methods were strictly Old World . Everything done by hand . The rounding , knocking , bleeding , gutting , skinning , splitting , dressing , aging , curing , pickling , packing , bone and hoof boiling , all of it done right on-site . The father slammed his hand down on the kitchen table and made the forks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge anyone to come up with better tasting meat . That shit what 's coming out of Chicago now ? Out of those big houses ? That ai n't meat . I do n't even know what to call it . It 's what you get when you pack half-dead cattle nose to asshole , scare the living hell out of them with shock prods , blow their brains out with a bolt gun louder than a cannon and then hoist them up to bleed ' em on a chain line . " " Uh-huh , " said the mother , yawning and stirring a tiny spoon into a jar of Julie 's baby food . Julie was sick . Something was very wrong with her . She was giving off smells . The father was taking straight pulls out of a bottle of Old Skull Popper . " With line crews , it 's output , output , output . They do n't cull . A carcass comes down the belt with tumors as big as your head and worms wiggling from hell to breakfast and you know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next bastard worry about it . They got the inspectors in their back pockets , they 'd stamp USDA on a dead rat . You know what USDA stands for ? You Stupid Dumb Ass . That 's what a customer is who buys that shit . Them line men piss right into the pickle vats . I know for a fact they do . " " Except it 's a ' Y ' , " said the mother . " What ? " " ' You ' begins with a ' Y ' . " said the mother . " Not a ' U ' . " The father stood to inherit Rohbeson 's Slaughter when Old Dad died . He was next in line . He was the only man in line . The last standing Rohbeson . " And he just sold it out from under me . Never said word one . I was out there running things , up to my nuts in blood and sawdust every day , telling him we were going to turn it around . ' Those big packing houses got nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back begging , Old Dad . ' And all that time he was nodding , blowing smoke up my ass . " We could have goddamned turned it around ! You know that half the cuts we do you ca n't even find anymore ? A whole world has just died out and no one gives a damn about it . Pretty soon you wo n't see an independent butcher anywhere . Gone . Shit . Gone . " " Uh-huh , " said the mother . " I 'm glad the bastard hung himself . If it was up to me I would have left him swinging with the carcasses right where he was . I would never have cut him down . I would have bled him and dried him and made him a goddamned mascot . A goddamned tourist attraction . Come on down over to Rohbeson 's Slaughter and meet Old Dad . Get your picture taken with him and have a free hot dog . " Bastard sold it all out from under me . Paid off the mortgages . Packed what was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the last of what he owed . Note said , ' Sorry , son . But at least I 'm not leaving you in the hole . ' " " Well , that is something , " said the mother . Julie 's head was hanging forward . She was asleep and her face was sweating . " SOMETHING ? " screamed the father . " It 's SQUAT ! Not even a goddamned life insurance policy ! SQUAT ! " His hands bounced some additional slams onto the table and then he stood up . This was our last dinner together . We were eating chipped beef on toast . " You better start looking for a job , " said the mother . " We 're supposed to be out of here by the first . " " JOB ? ! " shouted the father . The night went on like that . And the next day the wife of Ardus Cardall was rushed into St. Martha 's , the tiny hospital where the mother worked . Someone had blasted her arm off point-blank with a hunting rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinting hard at the father who squinted right back . He said , " Marie Cardall . She going to make it ? " The mother said , " What do you think ? " The newspaper version of the story said witnesses saw a man in Elkwood-issue coveralls near the house the night an escapee bulletin went out on the wires . Marie 's car was stolen and no one knew what else . She was shot with her husband 's rifle . The newspaper version said her husband Ardus was being questioned about it . " His alibi is tight , " said the father . " Ca n't get much tighter than being in jail yourself when the crime occurs . She going to pull through ? " The mother said , " What makes you so interested ? " " Hey , " said the father , " I do n't give a damn about Marie Cardall . I 'm just making conversation . " Suspicion was cast on Ardus Cardall because he was bitter about his wife turning him in and testifying against him . Bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Marie Cardall who contacted the police when Ardus came home from work and told her he might have buried the little boy that was lost , the boy the town was turning itself inside out about . He told Marie there was a pretty good chance he buried the Leonards boy alive in concrete while he was pouring the foundation for the new church . He said that by the time he noticed there was nothing he could do . The boy was gone . So he just kept pouring . He told Marie he was just hoping the whole thing would somehow blow over . " And she turned him in , " said the father . " She was right to report him , " said the mother . " Well , Ardus saw it differently . " " For god 's sake . " " If you think that she went to court because she gave a damn about that Leonards boy you are ignorant as living hell . " " Why , then ? " snapped the mother . " Figure it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . I guess it ai n't . " Saying " ai n't " with special emphasis . " Well ? " said the father . " Did she make it or not ? Is Mrs. Cardall still among us ? " " You tell me . " " My guess is she pulled through . " " Ha , " said the mother . " Ha-ha . You 're funny . " It was that night she shoved me into the backseat of his car and told me not to show my face . It was that night he told her he was leaving on a business trip and would probably be gone for a while .
