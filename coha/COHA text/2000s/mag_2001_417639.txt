A Healthy Blood Lipid Profile Goes Beyond " The Lower the Cholesterol , the Better " // Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans , accounting for more than 40 percent of all deaths in the United States . While heart disease is a broad term , it is used by doctors to describe atherosclerosis , the main cause of heart attacks and strokes . The National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) , a division of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) has just released the latest guidelines for identifying and managing risks for coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . If you are like many health-conscious individuals , you may be willing to take several steps to prevent heart disease . You make healthy food choices , you exercise and you probably take several supplements for your general health . However , you may be confused about what other steps you can take . You may wonder what role cholesterol and blood lipids play in cardiovascular health . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what you can do in terms of prevention . If you have already been diagnosed with heart disease , you may be wondering how you can supplement the program your doctor has given you . Atherosclerosis results from the buildup of plaque along the walls of blood vessels . It begins when the lining of the vessel is damaged . Fat carrying proteins , called lipoproteins , attach themselves to the damaged surface , causing cholesterol to build up . The low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) start to break down or oxidize , releasing free radicals , damaging nearby cells . The more LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in your blood , the more it can build up on the blood vessels . This whole process sets off the immune system to try to repair the damaged site , sending in specialized white blood cells , called macrophages , which eat the LDL-C . However when they become full of LDL-C , they become useless foam cells which contribute to the plaque formation . Chemical signals called growth factors are released , which cause fibrinogen ( a sticky substance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things together form a stiff plaque on the artery wall and ultimately block the artery . Your blood flow can be reduced by 90 percent before you feel any symptoms , but then it is too late ; CHD has occurred . These plaques have the unfortunate propensity to break loose , causing strokes , heart attacks and other ischemic conditions such as angina , poor kidney function , reduced eyesight , poor circulation in the legs ( claudication ) . If in addition to poor lipids levels , someone has other risk factors such as hypertension ( high blood pressure ) or diabetes , then these events are accelerated . A heart attack ( also called a myocardial infarction ) is when something blocks the flow of blood to your heart-a clot , a spasm or an accumulation of plaque . A stroke is brain damage that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted , either by a clot or when a blood vessel bursts . High blood pressure plays a crucial role in the development of heart disease and stroke . The higher the pressure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildup of plaque . For reasons that are not entirely known , diabetes also increases plaque formation . Blood Lipid Profile When doctors order a lipid profile , they are measuring the levels of all the cholesterol in your blood , both good and bad . These include : Total cholesterol ( TC ) , Low density lipoprotein ( LDL-C-also known as the bad cholesterol ) , Very low density lipoprotein ( VLDL-C-another bad player , very bad ) , High density lipoprotein ( HDL-C-the good " healthy " cholesterol ) and triglycerides ( TG-yet another bad player ) . They may order additional tests such as glucose , to test for diabetes and homocysteine levels , as elevations of homocysteine are also implicated in heart disease . When people talk about their " cholesterol level " they are usually referring to their total cholesterol . The assumption that many people make is simply " the lower , the better . " In reality , a healthy lipid profile is more complicated than simply low cholesterol . Cholesterol is a natural substance found in the body . The cells need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The liver usually makes all the cholesterol the body needs . The cholesterol one ingests in the diet provides excess amounts . Cholesterol travels from the liver into the circulation by hitching a ride on LDL . It is carried away from tissues and back to the liver aboard HDL . Perhaps even more important than the total cholesterol level is the ratio of good to bad cholesterol . High levels of HDL-C are cardioprotective . One well-known way to increase the level of HDL-C in the blood is to increase one 's activity level . Conversely , elevated levels of LDL-C are associated with an increased risk of heart disease , as are elevated triglycerides . We need a certain amount of HDL-C because as discovered in the 1970s , it actually protects against the buildup of cholesterol plaques . It acts as a scavenger preventing plaques from adhering to vessel walls . Without these scavengers , or when the ratio of HDL-C to LDL-C is off , plaques can build causing atherosclerosis ( or hardening of the arteries ) . An appropriate heart-healthy goal , then , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on a healthy lipid profile , with appropriate ratios of HDL-C , LDL-C and TG . Just as we should want to keep LDL-C and TG down to appropriate levels , we should also want to keep HDL-C up to an adequate level . The new definitions of normal , borderline and elevated cholesterol are more stringent than previously , which means that many more Americans will fall into " at risk " categories , with physicians recommending treatment . ( For appropriate HDL and LDL levels , see " New Recommendations " . ) New Recommendations Because heart disease claims more lives than any other condition in the United States ( as well as other industrialized countries ) , the NHLBI is continually reviewing risk factors for heart disease in order to find more effective ways to prevent it . In this spirit , the NHLBI 's National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) has established new guidelines for a healthy lipid profile . These guidelines establish LDL-C as the target for therapy and define as normal an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dl or less ( milligrams per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of 100-129 mg/dl as " above optimal . " Those of 130-159 mg/dl are still defined as " borderline high , " and those at 160-189 mg/dl as " high . " Those above 190 mg/dl are considered " very high . " A healthy HDL-C level is defined as at least 40 mg/dl . Previous guidelines had identified 130 mg/dl as a borderline LDL-C level and 160 mg/dl as a high level . A desirable level of HDL-C was previously defined as at least 35 mg/dl . ( See accompanying table . ) For more information on the new NCEP cholesterol guidelines you may want to visit this section of the NHLBI Web site : http : **53;1254;TOOLONG . The NCEP guidelines also call for more aggressive monitoring of people with " borderline " LDL-C levels . A physicians initial intervention for a person in the borderline category would typically be lifestyle modification . The number of Americans receiving recommendations increases from 52 to 65 million with the new guidelines . Lifestyle modifications designed to promote a healthy lipid profile include reduction of dietary fat , increase of soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as weight loss and smoking cessation , if indicated . As a result of the new recommendations , more people with borderline profiles may find their physicians recommending that they begin taking a cholesterol-lowering medication , in addition to lifestyle modifications . The new recommendations increase this number from 13 to 36 million Americans . The medications typically used to lower cholesterol belong to a drug category known as HMG-Con reductase inhibitors , or " statins , " because they end with the suffix " - statin . " Commonly used drugs in this category include atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) , cerivastatin ( Baycol ) , lovastatin ( Mevacor ) , pravastatin ( Pravachol ) , and simvastatin ( Zocor ) . Statins are typically prescribed with the goal of lowering LDL-C . They work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and increasing the number of LDL receptors in the liver . They also have a modest effect of increasing HDL-C and lowering triglycerides ( TC ) . While statins have a clear benefit , they can also have adverse effects , a risk with any effective therapy . Common side effects include myositis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , GI upset and elevated liver function tests . Physicians typically obtain liver enzyme levels before starting a patient on a statin medication and monitor those levels throughout therapy . Because animal studies have shown an increase in birth defects , statins are not appropriate medications to take during pregnancy . Additionally there is some concern that statin medications deplete levels of certain natural substances that are beneficial , such as coenzyme Q-10 ( CoQ10 ) , a heart protective substance that is made in the liver . For this reason many people on statin therapy often take supplements of CoQ10 as well . What Else Can You Do ? If your physician is concerned about your lipid profile , you should be too . There are several steps you may want to take before beginning statin therapy or in addition . Anyone with an elevated LDL-C and an HDL-C that is less than optimal would be wise to make any and all lifestyle modifications that apply . As mentioned earlier , these include increasing fiber and reducing dietary fat , which would lower LDL-C , and increasing physical activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to quit . If you have diabetes , tight glucose control can also aid your lipid profile . While you will certainly benefit from a heart-healthy meal plan , it is wise to be skeptical of fad diets . They are often designed more for the benefit of the developer 's pocketbook than for your health and they often are too stringent for a reasonable person to follow for long . When perusing a diet ask yourself , " Could I stay on this plan for the next five or ten years ? " If the answer is 11 no , " keep looking . In avoiding bad fats ( animal fat and saturated plant fats-i.e. palm oil and trans fatty acids-margarine ) do n't be afraid of the good fats : nuts , fish and other sources of omega-3 fatty acids . These can help you to achieve a good lipid profile . Red wine is protective , as is red grape juice , because the flavinoids protect against the oxidative damage from LDL-C . Soy protein has also been shown to lower LDL-C . Some supplements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , niacin supplements ( vitamin B3 ) have been used since the 1950s , particularly for lowering triglycerides . While immediate-release niacin is associated with flushing , the likelihood of flushing is much less with sustained-release formulations . However the risk of liver toxicity increases with sustained release formulations . Other side effects are nausea and difficulty with blood sugar control , making it less attractive for diabetics . Whether vitamin E supplementation is beneficial is in question . Several recent studies have shown no relationship between vitamin E supplementation and the prevention of cardiovascular mortality . However , future studies that take into account the bioavailability of vitamin E and appropriate dosages may yield different results . It works because of its antioxidant protection . Since it is fat soluble it is incorporated directly into the LDL-C molecule , helping prevent oxidative damage at the site of plaque formation . // COMPARISON OF EARLIER AND NEW CHOLESTEROL GUIDELINES // Folic acid ( vitamin Bsub 9 ) is known to lower homocysteine levels , as does vitamin Bsub 12 , vitamin sB and betaine . Since elevated homocysteine levels are associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wise to include these in any heart healthy plan . Garlic has also been shown to lower LDL-C and increase HDL-C . The sulfur-containing substances in garlic help inhibit HMG-CoA reductase . Garlic is best used as fresh garlic , as the preparations are somewhat ineffective . Prolonged cooking and drying destroys the sulfur-containing compounds that are thought to be beneficial . The equivalent of one clove per day is sufficient . Since garlic has some antithrombotic activity , it is not recommended for patients taking anticoagulants ( i.e. Coumadin ) . Pantethine : Known to Increase HDL-Cholesterol If you want to improve your lipid profile , you may want to consider supplements of pantethine . Remember the goal is not just lower cholesterol but a healthy profile overall . This includes LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dl or lower , TG of 150 mg/dl or lower and HDL-C levels of at least 40 mg/dl . Pantethine has been used for the past 30 years in Japan , where it is approved as a pharmaceutical agent for the purpose of increasing HDL-C . Pantethine is sold as a supplement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a derivative of pantothenic acid ( vitamin B5 ) . Pantethine has a greater capacity to lower cholesterol than the vitamin itself . It is a colorless or light yellow substance that is soluble in water and alcohol and is usually taken as a tablet . Pantethine works by slowing production of cholesterol in the liver and boosting the rate at which one 's metabolism uses fats . It significantly reduces levels of TC and LDL-C while raising HDL-C . It is the most effective natural product against serum TG levels . Pantethine is not known to cause significant side effects , has no known drug interactions and may be the best choice for diabetics . It has not been known to cause birth defects . In a recent multicenter study daily doses of 600 mg pantethine were associated with increases averaging approximately 7 mg/dl in HDL-C , as well as moderate decreases in LDL-C and TG . In addition to taking several other heart-healthy steps , you may want to add pantethine to the tools you use for improving your lipid profile . Where to Get Quality Pantethine In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to take a total of 600 to 900 mg daily , in two to three separate doses . Since the supplement industry is self-regulated , as a consumer you need to be cautious about how supplements are manufactured and whether they are what they claim to be . Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. , based in Japan , is the largest producer of pantethine in the world . They sell their own pantethine product here in North America as an ingredient to the dietary supplement industry under the name Pantesin(TM) . Pantesin is manufactured by Daiichi 's own proprietary process . The result is a consistent , high-quality product . If a pantethine-based dietary supplement product includes the name Pantesin , you can be assured that you are buying a supplement made with the highest quality , pharmaceutical  --  grade pantethine available in the market today . Supplements are just that . They do not replace adequate exercise and a healthy diet . To learn more about the role of fat in the body , visit the NCEP Web site ( listed earlier ) .
