Rheims The rain poured down throughout the day , hard and grey as cathedral stone . One by one , we dragged to a halt . I stopped dancing first , then Annette , our skirts hanging in damp folds , tangling in our legs . " It is like walking with dead fish , " I said . " Slip-slap . " Annette giggled . But then she found everything amusing . Even in the rain . Taking the tin whistle from his lips , Bertrand flicked it several times , trying to rid it of water . Nadine 's tambourine went still , and she shifted little Jean to her other hip . Now Pierre alone kept going , flinging the clubs into the air . One and two , three and four , five . . . I wondered if he were going to try seven at once , here on the drowned streets of Rheims where no one would see him fail . " What are you doing ? " Uncle Armand cried out , and began hitting the rest of us for stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " His hand was like some small , fierce , whey-colored animal nipping and pinching where it could . Pierre dropped one of his rain-slicked clubs . It landed with a loud splash in a puddle at his feet . He stooped to pick it up . Uncle Armand turned and slammed Pierre on the head with the gold-topped cane . " Clumsy fool ! Did I tell you to stop ? " Stepping to Pierre 's side , I began , " But Uncle , there is no one on the street . Even the beggars have left the road to seek shelter . We have come to the holy city for nothing , and . . . " Whap ! This time the cane fell on my head , and I saw stars . Pierre had been smarter , going right back to his juggling . Would I never learn ? One day Uncle would kill me withhis cane . " Mademoiselle La Bouche du Sud , " Uncle said , meaning Miss Mouth from the South , " says we have come to Rheims for nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time I bit my lip to keep from answering back . One day , I swore , I would break Uncle 's cane over my knee . Uncle was not finished speaking , though . His nose wrinkled as if he had smelled something foul . " We have come to Rheims for the young king 's crowning . Fortunes will be made here . The new queen loves pageantry , songs , dances , mummery . All of which Troupe Brufort can supply . " " But Uncle . . . " I began , wanting to remind him that the city was draped in black for the old king 's death- " A lance in his eye while jousting , " a walleyed beggar girl had said . " The new king insists on a long mourning . " So none of the grand folk racing to the coronation had heart or coins for street players . " Dance ! " Uncle commanded . " Now ! Good will come of it . " " Wet will come of it , " I mumbled . But not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pipe , and Nadine beat the tambourine against her sodden skirt once more . Annette and I shuffled our feet obediently in time and Pierre tossed up three clubs in a rotation he could do even in a pouring rain . " Bon ! " sang out Uncle , a rare compliment . Just then a well-dressed merchant and his three dark-clad daughters hurried past us , holding cloaks over their heads . The girls squealed in their distress . " Papa ! My boots ! " cried both the eldest and the youngest . " The rain is ruining my skirts , " the middle one added . " Talk less , " their papa responded . " Run faster . " Uncle insinuated himself into their way , smiling . He is like a serpent when he smiles-all lips , no teeth . " Pause for a moment , good sir . Witness the wondrous skills of Troupe Brufort , only recently returned from the courts of Padua , Venice , Rome . " Of course , Troupe Brufort had never been to any of those places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , had traveled beyond France . But Uncle always dropped great names like a horse with too much grass in its mouth letting fall the extra bits . The merchant spun around Uncle and hastened his whining daughters homeward , the backs of the girls ' tufted dresses looking like a dark rolling ocean . " This is stupid , Papa , " Pierre muttered , wiping his clubs one at a time on his shirt , a useless action , as his shirt was as wet as the clubs . " We will all come down with a fever , and for nothing . " Ignoring Pierre , Uncle strode over to Bertrand and snatched the pipe from his mouth . " Enough tiddly-piddly , boy ! Do your tumbling . Nadine strike up a beat . " Annette and I clapped in time to the tambourine , making soft smacking noises . One and two and one-two . On Nadine 's hip , little Jean awoke and tried to catch the raindrops . All at once , a clatter of hooves on the cobbles to our left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , their backs so wet , the hair looked black . On the carriage door was a coat of arms and a motto , but as I could not read , I did not know what it said . I glimpsed a red uniform under the driver 's cloak , the only bit of color I had seen in the city so far . Then the driver drew the cloak more firmly around his shoulders and that brief flame was quenched . Beside the driver was another man shaking as with an ague . Uncle nodded . " Ha ! " he cried , as if the appearance of the carriage vindicated all the beatings . The carriage pulled up close to us , so close that Bertrand hesitated in his tumbling for fear of frightening the horses . A gentleman peeked out of the window . He seemed very short for someone who carried himself so proudly . Toying with his thin mustache , he watched us for quite some time . " Do not stop ! " hissed Uncle . Bertrand leaped up again , doing first a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annette and I added some shuffling steps to our hand claps , and Pierre lofted five clubs . " Climb , " I whispered to Annette . " But my skirts . . . " she began . " To the devil with your skirts , " I said , locking my fingers together and holding my hands down low . Annette was so shocked at my swearing , she climbed without further comment , scrambling to my shoulders and leaving muddy footprints on my bodice . I gripped her ankles . Luckily she was only six years old and very light . " Smile , " Uncle hissed . We smiled . The shaking man climbed down from his station on the carriage and stood at attention by the carriage door . He had a disgruntled air , as if he dearly wanted to be in a warm , dry spot . The gentleman in the carriage just sat there , rubbing his mustache , while his servants got soaked , and all for the sake of our poor show . If he were to throw us a good-sized purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I smiled again , what Pierre calls my " winning smile " and Uncle calls " Nicola 's grimace . " Finished with his routine , Pierre gathered in the five clubs . But Uncle pinched his ear to get him started again . " Enough ! " the gentleman announced abruptly . " You will do . " Gratefully I lowered Annette to the ground . Her little golden curls were now hanging in long , wet strands . Pierre tucked the clubs under his arms and Bertrand-at the long end of a tumbling run-came back unhurriedly . " Do ? " Uncle brightened . The gentleman pursed his lips . " As I have seen no other troupe on this forsaken street , you will have to do . Jacques , show them the way to the palais . " Then he banged his cane against the carriage roof and called , " Get me home before I catch my death . " The servant Jacques jumped aside in time to avoid a splash of water from the carriage 's wheels as it pulled away , though Bertrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as his master was gone , Jacques let his shoulders droop . Glancing sourly at us , he rubbed his nose with the flat of his hand . " Follow me , and try to keep up . I do not want to dawdle in this weather . " " Whom have I the extreme honor and privilege to be addressing , monsieur ? " Uncle asked in the oily voice he used when speaking to rich people . " It is no honor addressing me , " Jacques answered , turning away and saying over his shoulder , " nor privilege neither . You had best save your fine manners for the new king . " For a moment Uncle froze , his lips silently forming the word " king " . The king . I thought . With the pretty queen who loves pageants . Then Uncle stirred , bowed and waved at us , his face suddenly exultant , open like a dried flower bed after a good shower . " Come along . Do not just stand there . The king is waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my every word if you wish to make a good impression . Nicola , you especially , do not open your mouth . " Pierre and I hurried to the wooden cart , each taking hold of a handle . The ancient cart creaked and protested , but for the first time ever it sounded like music to me . Bertrand , Annette , and Nadine grabbed their sacks off the ground , slinging them into the cart , then followed behind us . For once there was no chatter . We were going to entertain in a palace . How could anyone complain-even of the rain ? Perhaps we had come to Rheims for something after all ! Chapter Two In the Palace Marching ahead of the cart , a step behind Jacques , Uncle went proudly . His balding head was tilted at such an angle , he looked as though he were leading a parade rather than following a sullen servant along a rain-soaked backstreet . Jacques looked as if he had a bean stuck up his nose . He never even glanced around to see if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he had anything to do with our ragtag troupe . The rain began to ease at last , but the evening was drawing in . Rheims was still grey above , grey below , and grey in the middle , but there was a small , hopeful , golden glow in my belly . Each step I thought : But one more step and one more and one more towards the warmth . I was so concentrated on getting to where we were going , I had no idea where we were , and so I was entirely startled when Nadine cried out , " Look , children , there is the king 's palace . " Jacques sniffed at her . " No , madam , that is the palace of Charles , Cardinal of Lorraine and Archbishop of Rheims . The king and queen are but guests here . But it is our destination . " The cardinal 's palace was certainly large , but not nearly as large as some we had seen in our travels . As for that stone wall-we were connoisseurs of walls : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and castles . They were often the backdrops for our performances , though we had never actually been invited inside before . Still-walls meant roofs . Roofs meant shelter . Suddenly I was filled with new energy . Grabbing my cart handle , I gave it a hard shove which skewed the cart so that it wobbled on the cobbles . " Easy , " hissed Pierre . " Do not overturn the cart . Not now . " " As if I could ! " I countered . " Amazon ! " he said . " Flea ! " " Fleabite ! " And then we looked at one another and laughed . We were as close as brother and sister . Closer , really , for although we were not the same age , we were of the same disposition . We had chosen one another as confidante and friend . " Be quiet , all of you , " Uncle said , " and Nicola especially . " He raised his cane as a warning , for Jacques was talking to two guards at a small portal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peasant 's bolt-hole , " I replied . The two guards stepped aside , lowering their spears , and Jacques waved us through . After crossing a gravel-strewn courtyard , we parked the squeaking , protesting cart and took from it only those items we would need for our show . Then we followed Jacques inside . The passages were narrow , whitewashed , but dimly lit . I had expected something grand , I suppose , but it was like a rabbit warren , with lots of doors along the halls . At last Jacques stopped in front of one door and pushed it open . This was no luxurious apartment , but a plain room with a bare stone floor , bare walls , a single long table , and a couple of chairs . " Not even rushes or hangings to take away the cold ! " I complained , for in the fairy stories my mother had told me there were always such things in a palace . How I missed her stories . How I missed her and Papa , almost two years gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you know of such things ? And I blushed deeply-for shame , and for anger , too . To treat us so when we had done nothing to him . Uncle made a quick movement with his hand in my direction , promising a beating . Then he turned and said to Jacques in his deepest voice , smooth as oil , " I thank you on behalf of our troupe for these excellent accommodations . " Jacques merely grunted in response . " I am thankful , too , " I said , trying to make amends . After all , there were three basins of water , several towels , and two small cakes of scented soap on the table . A warm fire crackled in the grate . What were rushes and wall hangings compared to those ? But Jacques ' face got its bean-up-the-nose look again . " Try to make yourselves respectable , " he ordered curtly . " If that is possible . Someone will come for you in a short while . " As soon as the door shut behind Jacques , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all in trouble , mademoiselle , " he said , with a finger flick at the side of my head . It stung , of course , but I did not care . We were out of the grey rain , the fire was beginning to dry our clothing , and perhaps there would be food as well . Bertrand , Annette , and Pierre all made for the fire . As I went to join them , Uncle hauled us back , directing us to the basins . " Clean yourselves first . " He mimicked Jacques ' voice exactly . " If that is possible . Only then dry your clothes . " " But Papa , " Annette began , fingering her strings of wet curls . " There will be no buts , " Uncle told her . So we did as we were instructed while Uncle Armand had the fire all to himself . I swear that if he could have , he would have soaked up all the warmth and left none for the rest of us . After placing the sleeping Jean near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nadine fussed over Annette and me , trying her best to wipe every spot of mud from our faces . Then she turned her attention to Annette 's hair , spinning the curls around her finger and blowing on them . I was left on my own , first drying my hair with a towel . If we were to perform before the king and queen , I would have to make myself presentable . Uncle often told me that I was the least talented member of Troupe Brufort , adopted and not born into it , but still I would not disgrace the others with my looks . However , when I tried to comb my plaits out with Nadine 's hard brush , every tug hurt enough to make my eyes smart . " Do not stop brushing , " Uncle commanded . " Make something of that bird 's nest of yours . " " It is harder work , Uncle , " I said brightly , " tidying what is on top of my head than keeping straight what is inside it . " I thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so cold , I returned to the brush with a will . My hair finally in order-though much was left in the brush-I went over to the fire to dry my still-damp skirts and sandals . The smell we made steaming out was musky and familiar . Many a time Troupe Brufort had taken refuge-like the Holy Family-in a farmer 's stable , and glad of the shelter . I closed my eyes and , despite my excitement about performing before the king , fell fast asleep in front of the fire standing up , like a horse . The door opened creakily and I was startled from my sleep . An elderly woman with a heavily-lined face came in . She was dressed in a black silk mourning dress without a hint of ornamentation . Her eyes were the color of stone and her lips but two thin lines , one atop another , like folded linens . She glowered at us , as if adding up our virtues and finding us lacking a full measure . Then reluctantly , she stepped aside to admit a tall , delicately-boned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , enormous green-gold eyes under heavy lids , and a lovely long neck . Unlike her companion , she wore a dress of white and pale green . As she moved-spring to her companion 's winter-the skirt swelled out with close-set pleats like a bell that parted to show a smooth green underskirt . Her velvet overbodice was embroidered with gold leaves and green florets . The ruff at her neck was tinged with green from which jeweled ropes of pearls and beads hung down . She was like the fairy princess in one of Maman 's tales , and I drew in my breath in wonder . The older woman made a downward gesture in our direction with the flat of her hand . Only Uncle understood . He bowed deeply , motioning us to do likewise . So I bowed , just like Uncle and the boys , and was embarrassed when Nadine and Annette each performed a graceful curtsy . I could feel the heat rise in my cheeks as I blushed again . Uncle scowled at me . I think he would have beaten out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying too far away . The tall girl did not seem disturbed by my bow . In fact , looked positively amused to see me act like a man . Perhaps she had made a similar error in not wearing mourning ? I felt a sudden compassion for her . " What pretty young women and what handsome young men , " she said brightly to Uncle . Then for the first time she looked around the room . " But why is this room so plain ? So . . . empty ? I must have rushes and hangings sent down at once to warm it up . " " Rushes and hangings-I asked for such , " I blurted out . All of Troupe Brufort glared at me . But the tall girl smiled . " So should you all ! " I turned and grinned at the troupe , but no one smiled back . The tall girl continued . " I am delighted that you have come to us . Pray , do your very best to bring some joy into this dark day . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , like a wind over a flower garden . " This should have been the happiest of times for our new crowned king . But with his papa so newly and horribly dead , he can take little pleasure in it . " " So the beggar girl said , " I put in . Pierre grabbed my skirt and pulled me back and I realized I had gone too far , so I gave a quick curtsy . But the tall girl nodded , as if she had heard from the very same beggar . " Still , we must have some celebration today , a small token , do you not agree ? " She smiled again . " So tonight do not hold back , Troupe . . . " She hesitated , looking for the name . " Brufort , Your Highness , " put in Uncle , his voice deeply oiled . " Brufort , " she said , dimpling at him . Having finished her little speech , she turned gracefully and left the room . Her silk skirts sounded like a rivulet rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more welcoming . " Highness ? Highness ? Who was that ? " I whispered to Nadine . The elderly woman raised her eyebrows at me as though I had just spat upon the floor . " Stupid girl . That was the new queen , Mary . It is at her insistence this entertainment has been arranged . " The scowl on her face was evidence that she did not herself approve . " Queen Mary , " I whispered with the kind of passion one reserves for a life 's pledge .
