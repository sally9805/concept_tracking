Chapter Two A north wind whipped the air down in the Medicine Tail Draw , ran it back against the face of the mountain . Nothing to burn but dead grass , sagebrush , seedling scrub pine . None of it caught real good , the smoke made matters worse . Gibbon 's men had marched fifty miles in the last three days to join forces with Custer and come to find this . They could not escape the smell . Bled their noses dry , tickled their brains silly . They soaked their bandannas and hankies in cold river water , laid wet cloths over their faces . Sleep came fitfully . Hard ground , dusty cyclones , sticker bushes and dirt mites . They cursed their devils and slapped their own faces . Fat , blood-laden mosquitoes , biting gnats . Private Billy Gentle could n't kill enough of them , wondered which had been with the dead . Flies only live twenty-four hours , he said to a comrade . This is all they gon na know . The other soldier just nodded at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He meant the massacre , all they 'll know of human life , feeding on the dead and the near , buzzing through air heavy with panic , agony and bloodlust . The horseflies were insistent , nagging . Soldiers smacked at them , left sticky , arterial-red blood spots on their clothes and skin . The flies ' incandescent wings reflected the light of the dying sun . The soldiers worked , in teams of two and three , to drag the bodies out of the coulee up to the hills , hard , demoralizing work . All day , bone tired , spooked . They tried singing to their ladies , to their gods , to their mamas . As the last of the sun sank red over the rounded buttes , to the distant west a rainbow stretched into blue night , no trace of rain . Yapping dogs , satiated , emboldened , roamed the camp , restless , barking and skittish at any attempt by the soldiers to make friends . A Gavilan from Chesapeake County in Maryland took a line of string , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale moonlight on silver water . Threw in his line , trawled a fly that just skimmed the surface . This motion , the old feel in his arms and hands would be the closest to calm he would get for a while . He wondered if the fish could smell the dead too . He did n't have much luck . There was n't any left . The stars began twinkling on way up . A man yelled out as if in a dream . He 'd had enough . Gunshots in the middle of the night echoed off the rock face . Morning found one of them dead . When they turned him over his eyes fell open , had a mouthful of dirt . An Evans from Baltimore , a Private with straight out buckteeth , a hare-lip and an attempt at a handlebar mustache , just long string wisps of hair . It did n't look good , but no one said this to his face . Someone remembered the march , kept falling down , till his pants ripped , his knee bloodied , turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . He 'd always got up , the fellow said . Least ' cept till now . No one had any idea why , no one question 'd what he 'd done . Jim Thorne , a Maine volunteer with a drifter 's distant eyes and a soft heart , had talked to Evans , like others did to the spooked horses . They 're just flies , he said . They 've gotten under m'skin . I can feel em , Evans told him . We 're all suffering somehows , son . Not like me , Mister . He yelled like a scared boy , jerked up from sleep , wakened by dreams , his voice high and keening . When Evans suddenly reached out and hugged him , Thorne tried hard not to recoil from the dirt-streaked , greasy boy . Hey , hey , son , what cha trying to do ? he asked him . Thorne slapped him on the chin but could not deter or embarrass the boy . He did n't know where he was . C'm on now , ahh it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Evans yelled . C'm on , son . They 's just flies . Thorne felt embarrassed to have to talk to another man like this . When he turned away , Evans grabbed his gun , put it to his head and pulled the trigger . An old Colt Peacemaker his father had given to him when he told where he was going . Gun put a hole side his head ya could walk through . It happened just like that , someone said . Whut-int nothing old Thorne could do . Others told the next day , when they found the boy and pieced him together . Only Thorne was close enough to see and he said little . Suicide was a mortal sin . He had n't been to church on it , but his mama had Sundays his whole life , that was good enough for him . Good a time as any , I giss , he said . For the rest and whole of his life Thorne never said another word about the boy from Baltimore who died in his arms . Walked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gray horses , one spotted on the forehead , stark and ghostly they stood , against the black ground with the sky coming on to morning dressed in pale blue just above the line of their backs . Thorne got out his curry comb , brushed them down . He liked the way it felt to be with them this time of day . Private Billy Gentle watched from a bluff , crouched like an eagle about to jump off into the sky . Evans , at one point , had looked over at him , searching for something to fix his eyes on in the chaos of his last moments , but the glance that way only seemed to make it worse , as if whatever Gentle was doing was increasing his disquiet . Now Gentle quickly jumped up , cut through the crowd 's embarrassed milling around to carry the poor boy up the hill . What you gone to do ? somebody asked him . There ai n't but one thing to . Standing around talking ai n't it . Y'all can gim me a hand if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young talking to them like that . Others knew Gentle , so they did n't care . A few stepped up , helped to carry the Chesapeake Evans up the hill . That boy 's a little fast with his words , someone said when they 'd gone . Hell , he 's an idjit , what he is . Better watch hisself is all . You ever seen him shoot ? Boy 's one helluva crack , quick-draw shot . I ai n't looking to cross him , not with no gun , but I 'll punch him iffin I git the chance . Gentle and the others dumped Evans into a big hole , wiped hands on their pants and went back to what they were doing . Gentle was playing a game . Some of the bugs were so fat and slow with blood it was possible to strike a match and burn them out of the air . He liked the t-sss sound it made . It was a way to pass the time toward dawn . He did n't like to sleep , ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses . All night they snorted , as if trying to physically rend the smell from their nostrils . The horses tittered like after a storm , put Gentle to mind of a tornado that hit his family homestead once . Barns tossed on end , whole houses swept off in the winds . He watched the barn pulling off the earth , take off all at once . Horses there held on to the earth , like they were doing it right through their feet . The cyclone passed . There they were , standing in the very place where the barn had been moments before . For days after , the horses were queer . He would not sleep at all tonight . He knew this . He looked over sleeping ranks of men , like little clumps of uneasy dead , black on dark rolling lush , night-blued hillside . Turning over , cursing , scratching , clawing at themselves like dogs . They dug on in shifts during the night . No one liked the detail , but no one complained . They did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay even a minute longer than they had to . As the night went on , more and more grabbed up their bedrolls and went down to the riverside . They washed their hands and soaked their heads . The smell followed them there . It had been with them the whole of the day and haunted them through the night , got into their clothes , mingled with the rank sweat of exhaustion and fear , the linger of shit , semen and piss . In the middle of the open field Lieutenant James Bradley and Private August Huebner watched Gentle . They lay on their sides , elbows propped up on their bedrolls . Lieutenant Bradley let his mind wander back to the morning before , when they left to scout around the Little Bighorn River . The night before the Crows were the only ones who had any idea what had happened to Custer and his men . Some of the Crow Indians had been out looking around . The battle had taken place on their land . They were worried for their own . When they returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 'd seen . Had all the Sioux really left ? Major Reno 's men on the hill said they 'd begun riding off at Gibbon 's approach . Spoke of it with wide eyes , with the credulity saved for miracles . Some of Reno 's men cried on the shoulders of their comrades in relief . But where had the Sioux gone ? Lieutenant James Bradley , as the leader of the first scouting party , was to set out at dawn to find out . Bradley did n't sleep . He had counted heads , both battle-ready and wounded , then reported to command . At dawn he had called Huebner away from a sloppy morning cook and coffee fire . Bradley stood talking with some of the Crow Indians that were part of the scouting party . One was crying . When Huebner caught Bradley 's attention , the Lieutenant turned away , toward the rising sun , shading his eyes with his hand . Bradley liked the tall , gangly German . He kept his mouth shut and could go forever . We know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't know where . The Indians ? Them too . Hey , Cap'n , someone said . He was set off from the straggly group by the fire . What have you heard of Custer , sir ? Bradley did n't answer him , just took Huebner 's arm , started to lead him away , but the speaker had stood up in their path . He wore tattered denims with his uniform bluecoat and the brim of his hat pinned back . A faded blue bandanna tied round his dirty neck . The wind was already kicking up dust , blowing it in their eyes . What 's the big secret around here ? he asked . We all saw what them Injuns did to Reno . Why ai n't we talking about it ? What in the hell are we going to do ? Wait out here to they come back and kill us all ? What 's your name , soldier ? William Ezekial Gentle . Where you from ? Wilkes County , North Carolina . That 's up in the Blue Ridge , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No disrespect , sir , I jes do n't like sitting around here . Not after we lost all them boys on the Reno hill yesterday . Well c'm on then . By the way , my rank is Lieutenant not Captain . All the same to me , sir . Lef-tenant ? The sound of Huebner 's voice brought Bradley back to the present . In the waxing blue of dusk , they sat and watched Gentle . What 's he doing ? Killing flies , looks like . Did you see him in the field with the horses ? How could I miss it ? He lost his head . That was no way to act . Huebner picked a nit from behind his ear and squished it dead between two fingers . They were hurt and suffering , Bradley said . Somebody had to do it . There 's a way , certain way to do things , right . We 'd like to think so most of the time . What do y'mean by that ? I 'm not sure , soldier . I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt and rubbed it in with his hand . He must of shot at least five of them inside of a minute , Huebner said . He disobeyed your order . It was n't my order . Huebner looked the Lieutenant over , more curious than surprised at what he was hearing . He lost his head , Lef-tenant . Maybe . He was out of control . He disobeyed the Captain Jenks . They 've flogged others for less . Maybe . I spect they wo n't be doing any flogging for whatever happens for a few days . Some birds had come up , and as he spoke Bradley watched them light on to some crumbled bread too mealy for any of the soldiers to stomach . One , then two sparrows . The first sun rose purple . Maybe he jes did something the rest of us would have like to find a way to do , Bradley said . What ? Kill a bunch of defenseless , suffering horses ? I do n't know . Kill something . Bradley grabbed a handful of pebbles and tossed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Gentle took off his clothes and walked in his drawers to the river . More birds shot up from the willow thicket , but he walked right on through them . I guess he 's going for a swim , Huebner laughed . He 's a good un . And we 're taking him with us ? We 'll need his shot . God help us . They watched Gentle splash straight into the cold river . He strode in up to his waist then dove toward the bottom , a shadow-figure in the dark water , light now up in the sky but not yet down in the valley . In a few moments others joined Gentle and soon there were at least fifty men , washing themselves down in the river . Bradley still felt the nervous tingling in his joints and stomach he 'd had all the past day and it had n't gone . That Gentle reminds me of certain horses we used to have on the farm back home in Richmond , he said . Most of em would act like to please the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you call them ? Just horses , I guess . Bradley watched his hand trembling as he spoke . When he caught Huebner 's eye he held on to the ground to stop the shaking . It was n't that they could n't be broke , he said . It was more like they did n't know what broke was . Huebner packed a pipe with the litter of stems and odd leaves that stood in for tobacco in the regiment , lit it and passed it to Bradley . A swirl came up and carried the smoke away toward the tomorrow they were reluctant to begin . The wind rolled over tall grass in yonder field . They watched over the hundreds of restless men , soon back to themselves after the quick respite in the water , restless shadows on the hillside . The two passed the pipe , and in this manner gone were the last minutes unto dawn . When the dawn came they were still there , this , despite their prayers and oaths to the contrary . Private August Huebner got a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered just a couple days before , riding down through the hills with Bradley and Gibbon at the head of a long , proud column . Beyond the river the mountains rose and there was the plateau Reno 's men had retreated to . He 'd never seen suffering like what had been up on that hill , the ones that had made it to the makeshift field hospital . Further along the ridge to the west was where they buried Custer 's Seventh Cavalry dead . They 'd found most of them down along the coulee ditch . The mountain ridge above them was bare , some sagebrush and brown grass , the water of the Little Bighorn River unbelievably blue . They had done as much as they could for the dead , now they had to tend to the wounded . Those who had slept awoke now to their moans . Major Reno 's men were spread out along the hillside directly above their riverside spot . Most had been sedated by morphine . Now they needed more . Colonel Gibbon detached some men to the willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded to take them down to the Bighorn River proper , where they could be transported by boat back to Fort Peck . There were only three doctors in the entire troop . They set broken bones , salved and wrapped wounds , dug out bullets with fire-blackened knives , gave out others to bite . The sun never faltered , heat lingered into the afternoon , any breeze just blew dust at them . Corporals Bostwick and Goodwin volunteered and were commissioned to ride on to the Bighorn River to notify the Commander , General Terry , about what had happened . To tell them to be ready at the riverboat for their coming . Bradley , Gentle and Huebner also set out . Y'all circle around , the acting Commander Gibbon said , see if ya can git a trail and find where those Indians went off to . We do n't need any more surprises . We ai n't in what ya would call fightin ' shape . The three scouts rode right up over the rise then down through the coulee . They put their hankies back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead . They set their horses to a gallop and followed an obvious mile-wide trail that led away from the site of the abandoned Indian encampment beyond the river to the south . They saw no Indians , whether alive or dead . What Indians had fallen they 'd taken with them when they 'd gone . Burned black earth and grass was all that was left . Near the southern end they found something . Look at this , sir , Huebner spoke up . He pointed to a series of calfskins left stretched over poles stuck in the dirt . They were hid from view by a clump of cottonwoods and a mess of sticker bushes . What the hell is that ? Gentle wondered . Something . I can see that . It 's a sort of celebration , a religious thing , I b'lieve . They had a party did they ? Oh , go to hell , Gentle . I believe I just now left it , Gentle said , and spit in the dirt . Bradley ignored him then and rode over for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altars . Tied to each was a piece of the shredded remnants of a Seventh Cavalry flag guidon . On a couple hung the decaying heads of their comrades . Bradley took his hat off . Jesus , Gentle said , I 've had about enough of all this as I can stand . Maybe we should just go , Huebner said . They kicked their horses and rode . Gentle went over and snatched up one of the skins and stuffed it into his saddlebag . When it cooled off later in the day and the rains began , he would wrap the legs about his neck and let the rest hang down his back for a coat . They stopped down by the river after following a trail that set out from the site of the encampment , resting and watering the horses in a thicket of willows . When they first smelled the rain on the wind , they mounted and rode straight up a draw to the top of a rise . They could see lightning in the distance . They rode into a wall of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy to follow . Grass eaten down as far as they could see , on and on , over hill and bluff , rolling like a great , dried river current . They chewed on dried salt-pork and hardtack . Bradley led with Huebner keeping back a step or two . Gentle rode in fits and starts , seeming to let his horse lead him , just riding its moods . He had an ungelded black stallion with white boots . He came back with it one night when they had camped on the plains . It was one helluva horse . After a few hours they stopped at a fork in the trail . Sir , Gentle spoke up , I do n't think this is the right trail . Private ? This looks older . This looks more like a coming trail than a going one . Why do you say that ? I do n't know . I jes do . Huebner silently let his horse follow the other trail off a few steps then came back . You think he 's right ? he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days here or there . This very well could be the trail they come in on . Sure were a hell of a lot of them . If this is the coming trail , they come together right here . All we ken do is follow this un , see what we find and then try t' other . How will we know ? We wo n't , Gentle spoke up . There ai n't no way a knowin . If we find em we 'll sure know that . From the highest rise they could look back to the soldiers ' campsite and watch the rain on its way . Hell now , Gentle said , for what it 's worth , I 'm glad to git away from all that back there . What you say there , German man ? You can call me Gus . Anyway naw , I do n't think anyone ken fault ya that . Maybe the rain will help . It would take a helluva lot , Bradley added . The three riders camped in the rain that night under the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead of night Huebner awakened to a pitched whining sound . A horse ? The wind ? Gentle was grinding his teeth in his sleep . Huebner had some bad dreams himself . He went for a walk and skipped stones across the black water of the river . Once he got six skips . They set out again in more rain the next morning , shared a ration of coffee between them , nibbled hardtack . Rain hit them in waves . They rode through clear blue skies , turned gray by the hour , clopped on through mud and splashed through puddles , rode up rises , down cuts and along the stark , jagged edges of the coulee-ditches . Hours passed , the country unwound and so did they . You see any Indians ? Bradley asked Huebner . No , sir . I sure do n't . They stopped by an exposed stone face , burnt red and white shale , pink aged striates in the rock . When they stood still the day had a silent quality to it , as if for a moment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crickets and constant wind . They 're going to want us to have seen Indians . I know it . I call em as I see em . What if they all just split up ? Say what , Gentle ? That 's what I woulda done . We 're the ones that gone and brought the fight on . You 're the Indy-ann expert . So ? You said there were different tribes on the battlefield , right ? The Crow guides said mostly Sioux , Comanche and Cheyenne , Bradley answered . What were all of them doing together like that ? Gentle asked . I mean besides whipping our white asses . Bradley took a drink from his skin then looked off through the rain . Maybe they only got together to lick us , Gentle went on . I heard some of the boys talking before , said their chief done gone to soldiering school . Ta-tanka I-yo-take . What say ? That 's Sioux for Sitting Bull , Private . Ya ai n't got to show off now . They could be in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your counsel is well-taken , Private . Ahh hell , do n't talk to me like a kid . I could be as right as anyone . I 'm serious . So am I , Private Gentle . Bradley looked at Huebner , who remained silent . In any event we will double back toward the river . We can pick up the other trail then head down to meet the rest of the troops . They rode on through a series of great desert bowls set between the rounded buttes , one after another that turned the day into night . This was out in the open with the sun burning the wet off the grass . As they rode in the dark the rains came once more . They kicked their horses and hurried on . They hoped to make it before midnight . But they rode up to the river , well into morning and came upon the soldiers making their last tramp to the waterside . Private Huebner saw a man kneeled down with his head in his hands off by himself by a cottonwood tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his canteen . He heard what they 'd missed while they were gone . Everyone who could helped to get the fallen men to the river . They had started with two men per , carrying litters fashioned from cut saplings , but in the slicing rain and sticky mud they needed four and sometimes five . This man , a Private Nick Edelson , was helping to pull his brother 's litter . The Edelsons were Jews from Kentucky . Brother Jack had been wounded through the stomach by an arrow in the first exchange the week before on the Rosebud with General Crook . His brother saw him ; they were shooting side by side behind a wall they 'd built of mud and rocks for the charge of the Indians . He went for a doctor , but returned with only sympathy to find Jack with the arrow in his hand , a tight grimace on his dirty face . He 'd bled horribly that day and even now , after being bandaged and dressed , two days later . Nicholas stayed with his brother . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack had fallen to the ground . He never complained , and was humble toward the men he was so dependent on . His moaning was constant . When after a fall it stopped , the elder Edelson was dead . For a while his brother would n't leave him . Finally , he did . He said a prayer , took his brother 's personals and went to catch up with the troopers . Broke his heart to leave him like that . After a five-and-a-half-hour trudge , the troop had only made it four miles . Under the General Crook 's orders they stopped and made mule litters until dusk . The line spread out . Stragglers arrived at the river throughout a sad and rainy night . The soldiers made it to the river in miserable rain and pitch-black dark to load the wounded on the riverboat called Far West . The officers were drinking . Their tent reeked of wet horses , of tobacco , corn liquor and the men themselves . Old Crook was there , with long beard wound into two points with candle-wax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declaiming all the finer points of why he was still alive and Custer dead . When the scouts came in , he sat down and hit off a tin of strong black coffee . They said he never drank . Gibbon stood by with a quiet intense drunk on . He bit the bark off a stick , watching the approach of the three scouts when they rode up out of the darkness . One hand on the pole for steady , cigar chomped in his teeth , bottle on his thumb . The three scouts tramped through the night 's relentless rain . They tied their horses to a cottonwood tree by the black rushing water then clomped through ankle-high mud . Private Gentle lost a shoe and cursing had to pull it out of the thick muck . Gibbon greeted them solemnly , squeezing Bradley 's shoulder and then Huebner 's , nodding warily at Gentle 's cock-eyed grin . The Private , a bit cowed to actually meet the command , just stuck the boot back on . Reno also came up to greet them . Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reedy , a dog stuck under a fence . He hit off a tiny medicine bottle of morphine , walked with a limp . Bloodless face pale as his white beard . You boys been ... you boys been ... He huffed twice , leaned back with an empty fish-eye smile . A horse stuck its nose through a flap in the tent . Reno walked toward it and held the empty medicine bottle to one of its nostrils . The horse snorted and he patted its nose . You got to excuse Major Reno . He ai n't hisself just yet , Gibbon said and led them in . Gibbon ladled out bowls of stew for each of them as thanky 's were exchanged by all . Next to Gibbon was Terry , a very courtly gray-haired officer , and the two of them made quite a contrast to the earthy Crook and Reno . His uniform looked newly pressed even out here in the mud and rain . Bradley 'd never seen the man when he did n't look immaculate . He had on his full dress blues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gibbon spoke up . What did you boys find out ? They out there ? We did follow some trails , sir , Bradley answered . Saw some real strong signs . But you did n't see any ? No , sir . Gibbon stuck one end of his stick in his mouth and chewed , thoughtful for a moment . Hellfire , he said . If we do n't find some Godforsaken red men , after what happened to Custer we 'll be lucky if they do n't call us all home next week . We had three columns of men right there . If Custer 'd a waited we could have got em right there . Gibbon tossed the stick away , crumpled up his cigar , balled the leaves into a wad and stuck them in front of his teeth . Damn right that , Reno said , and stood up . They all turned to watch and to listen . General George Armstrong Custer told me to go in first and he 'll foller , Reno said . He never come . That lying sumbitch got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said coolly . He shook his head and turned back to Bradley . His manner was like the others had n't spoken . Well , we want you boys to keep going , that is if you 're a willing to . Terry smoked his tobacco in a pipe and drank his liquor from a glass . Bradley could n't tell he was drunk until he got up close and smelled his breath . Terry 's manner was like that of a kindly father , waiting to be told an answer he knew himself . He placed one gloved hand on the Lieutenant 's shoulder . He looked Bradley flush in the eye as he spoke to him , his crystal blue eyes taking his measure , drawing the soldier up to his full height of six-two . We 're counting on y'all to keep an eye on them Injuns . We got a score to settle . Yes , sir . We would n't want to miss the dance , Gentle spoke up . Well now , Terry said , and laughed like he did n't mean it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted Gentle on the back . You got yourself a game crew there , Bradley . Yes , sir . We 're going to need some time to regroup here , the General went on . But we 'll be ready soon enough and we 're going to count on you scouts to lead us to them . We do n't want a repeat of the other day , Gibbon spoke very quietly , but no one missed a word . He had that draw , something about his eyes , watery and red though now , a witness that had seen something very important . It is our opinion , Terry broke in again , that they 've gone on to hide in the mountains . With this he looked off into the rain outside , flicking some speck of mud off his boot . We should be ready in a few weeks , Gibbon said . He blinked his eyes and rubbed his brows . Bradley could only tell how drunk Gibbon was by how slow and measured was his speech , by how red were his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Saturday bouts . His pa had him when he was an old man , his pension bride dying in childbirth . He 'd start in on the bottle in his bath , the tub an old tin one in the middle of the kitchen , made the boy carry buckets of steaming water , dripping sweat from his forehead . Pa telling stories of his soldiering days . When he 'd come in late from the bar , he would wake young Bradley and tell him stories in the blue light of dawn . He went off to war an old man and came back dead . We 'll set up camp at the Tongue River , Gibbon went on . When the new recruits arrive we 'll be at full strength once more . Right , General Crook ? Yes , sir , Colonel , I 've sent word for the Fifth Cavalry , with them to join the Second and Third , we 'll have up to two thousand men . We 'll be ready for those Sioux next time , boys . We await your orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are ready to ride . Sometimes the old man would slap him , not hard , just so you 'd be ready when the time comes , ready for the things his dad always spoke of , women , fate and heaven , ready to be brave . He always had to be ready , the slaps would come out of the blue . Well , tell me this , boys , Terry said , turning on his heel to face them all again . Can y'all be ready to go in the morning ? Yes , sir , we could leave now . Well , finish your dinner , at least . Terry laughed his breezy laugh . Get some shut-eye and leave in the morning . Have a drink then , boys , Reno spoke up . Up and reeling , his eyes almost shut , hand in his pants , scratching obscenely , the other gripped a fresh bottle of rye . Would have run straight into Gentle , if he had not gracefully stepped back and accepted the bottle , drank and passed it around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major leaned on him as he spoke . What 's your name , son ? August Huebner . Have a smoke ? When Huebner graciously accepted , Reno handed off a cigar and turned to Gentle . And you ? William Ezekial Gentle , Private that is , Third Class . Good name , the Major nodded . Bible name . Tell me now . Are you scared of the Lord , son ? They all watched Reno as one might a horse in the middle of a fall , to see how bad it might be . No 'm . You ought to know now , son . If y'are or not . You ought to know . Yes , sir . Behold , the princes of Israel , Reno blinked his eyes and recited , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood . Son , do you know that verse ? Why it 's from the book of my namesake , sir . I knowed the whole thing . It 's how I learnered how to read . Can thine heart endure , Gentle recited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I shall deal with thee ? I the Lord hath spoken it . Reno took Gentle 's hand and led him through the tent flap out into the drenching rain . C'm on , son , he said , let us go out into the rain for a moment . Everyone looked at each other , one by one then at their feet . Crook 's mouth was wide open . He nodded at Gibbon , who just shook his head . In a moment the strange pair were back , rain running off the bills of their hats . All right then , boys , get what sleep you can , Crook stepped up . Come by and see me before you go , Lieutenant Bradley . We 'll settle it all out . Gentle , with Huebner 's help , very kindly and indulgently led Reno back to his cot . The Major whispered in Gentle 's ear all the while , as the Private nodded quietly . After salutes all around , the three scouts walked back out into the rain . What did he say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneel and say a quick prayer , sir . I 'll be damned .
