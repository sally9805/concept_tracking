<p> A 15-year-old youth on Friday became the third person arrested in the fatal shootings of three young people on a Newark playground last week . An intense police manhunt continued for at least two other suspects , including another teenager . <p> The arrest came hours after the man suspected of being the ringleader in the crime pleaded not guilty . The authorities revealed that he is an illegal immigrant from Peru who could have been detained by federal authorities after one of his two previous arrests in the past year . Instead , the immigrant , Jose Lachira Carranza , a 28-year-old construction worker , was free on $150,000 bail at the time of the killings last week , despite pending felony charges of aggravated assault and sexual abuse of a child . <p> " The system is overwhelmed from top to bottom , " said Armando B. Fontoura , the Essex County sheriff , whose office discovered Mr. Carranza was in the country illegally , and reported it to the federal government , after he turned himself in on Thursday . " This guy got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said the agency was not notified about Mr. Carranza 's status until Thursday . <p> " Had we been contacted , that would have almost certainly triggered a detainer , " Mr. Raimondi said , referring to the mechanism by which the immigration service prevents criminal suspects from being released on bail and moves to deport them once charges are resolved . When an immigrant faces a charge as serious as one of those against Mr. Carranza , accused in the rape of a 5-year-old , he said , " we are going to bring that person into our custody posthaste . " <p> Local authorities are not required to report the immigration status of people they arrest . Some municipalities , like Suffolk County on Long Island , have made aggressive efforts to do so as part of a crackdown on illegal immigrants , while others consider themselves " sanctuary cities " and avoid such questions , in part because of concerns that it could have a chilling effect on immigrants ' relationship with the police . <p> Mayor Cory A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been returned to the street . <p> " Whether he is documented or undocumented is irrelevant , " Mr. Booker said . " What matters is he is a murderer , and he should n't have been on the streets . It 's obvious the system is broken . " <p> Investigators believe that at least five people  --  including Mr. Carranza , a 15-year-old arrested Thursday , and the one arrested Friday  --  formed the group that set upon the young people last Saturday night , using at least one gun and a machete that was found near the scene . At least one of the victims , Iofemi Hightower , was attacked with the machete , investigators said . She had slashes across her face and cuts on her forearms , the latter seen as evidence that she had tried to resist . <p> Ms. Hightower , 20 ; Dashon Harvey , 20 ; and Terrance Aeriel , 18 , were forced to kneel in the weed-strewn lot at Mount Vernon School and were killed with bullets to the back of the head . Natasha Aeriel , 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she survived , and picked Mr. Carranza out of a photo array from her hospital bed . <p> At the Ivy Hill Park Apartments , where at least one of the teenage suspects lives and Mr. Carranza lived several years ago , Jason Toomer , 20 , said that Mr. Carranza pulled a gun on him in March after accusing Mr. Toomer of taking his cellphone , but that another man calmed Mr. Carranza down . <p> " He was running them , " Mr. Toomer said , referring to Mr. Carranza and the teenage suspects . " He was telling them what to do . " <p> When officers suspect that a person is in the country illegally , they can send a message to the immigration 's service 's Law Enforcement Center in Williston , Vt . <p> Paul M. Loriquet , a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor 's office , which is handling the assault and sexual abuse cases against Mr. Carranza , said his office notified immigration authorities about defendants ' status only " upon conviction and sentencing . " He added that Mr. Carranza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been appearing at all his hearings  --  he has not been a risk of flight . " <p> Capt . John Buoye of the West Orange police , which arrested Mr. Carranza in connection with an assault last fall , said his department had no set protocol for dealing with illegal immigrants , though it does have a long list of " consular notifications , " for when citizens of certain countries are arrested ; Peru , Mr. Carranza 's native land , is not on the list . <p> Sheriff Fontoura said that an investigator in his office decided to check on Mr. Carranza 's Social Security number on Thursday and discovered it was false , which led to the detainer . <p> Sheriff Fontoura said his investigators routinely checked the Social Security numbers of people they arrest . In addition , when processing prisoners arrested by other agencies , sheriff 's deputies frequently call immigration authorities if they suspect the prisoners are in the country illegally , he said . <p> A spokesman for the Newark Police Department would not comment on Friday on the policy for reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday morning , Judge Michael R. Casale asked Mr. Carranza , who wore an orange jumpsuit and had his hands shackled to his waist , whether he had a Social Security number . " I do n't have any , " he said , almost inaudibly , in Spanish , as a translator conveyed his answer to the court . <p> Judge Casale asked Mr. Carranza 's lawyer , Felix Lopez-Montalvo , whether his client was in the country legally ; Mr. Lopez-Montalvo replied that Mr. Carranza was not . <p> The Essex County prosecutor , Paula T. Dow , said Mr. Carranza would stand trial and , if convicted , serve his sentence before being deported . " He 's not leaving our system until these matters are adjudicated , " she said . <p> According to Mr. Carranza 's older brother , Jesus Lachira Carranza , the family came to Newark in the early 1990s from Chimbote , Peru , a fishing town on the country 's north coast . The younger Mr. Carranza worked in construction , living in the Ivy Hill neighborhood until about four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Orange . <p> When asked why he moved to the United States , Jesus Carranza laughed and said that , like most immigrants , he wanted to " come here and work .
