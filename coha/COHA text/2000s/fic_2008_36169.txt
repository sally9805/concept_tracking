Part One Emperor Muad'Dib 10,194 AG One Year After the Fall of Shaddam IV <br> Much more remains of my father than these few fragments . His <br> bloodline , his character , and his teachings have made me who I am . <br> As long as the universe remembers me as Paul- Muad'Dib , so too <br> will Duke Leto Atreides be remembered . The son is always shaped <br> by the father . <br>  --  inscription on the Harg Pass Shrine <br> A serene ocean of sand stretched as far as the eye could see , silent and still , carry ing the potential for terrible storms . Arrakis  --  the sacred world Dune  --  was becoming the eye of a galactic hurricane , a bloody Jihad that would rage across the planets of the crumbling Imperium . Paul Atreides had foreseen this , and now he had set it in motion . <br> Since the overthrow of Shaddam IV a year ago , millions of converts had joined Paul 's armies in addition to his own Fremen warriors , all of whom had pledged their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other trusted officers , his holy warriors had already begun to fan out from staging areas , bound for specific star systems and targets . Just that morning , Paul had sent Stilgar and his legion off with a rousing speech that included the words , " ' I bestow strength on you , my warriors . Go now and perform my holy bidding . ' " It was one of his favorite passages from the Orange Catholic Bible . <br> Afterward , in the heat of the afternoon , he had taken himself far from the bedlam of the city of Arrakeen , from the agitated troops and the fawning clamor of worshippers . Here in the isolated mountains , Paul required no Fremen guide . The high desert was silent and pure , giving him an illusion of peace . His beloved Chani accompanied him , along with his mother , Jessica , and his little sister . Not quite four years old , Alia was vastly more than a child , pre-born with all the memories and knowledge of a Reverend Mother . <br> As Paul and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to cling to a feeling of serene inevitability . The desert made him feel small and humble , in sharp contrast to being cheered as a messiah . He prized each quiet moment away from the devoted followers who chanted , " Muad'Dib ! Muad'Dib ! " whenever they glimpsed him . Before long , when news of the military victories started streaming in , it would get even worse . But that could not be avoided . Eventually , he would be swept along by the Jihad . He had already charted its course , like a great navigator of humanity . <br> War was one of the tools at his disposal . Now that he had exiled the Padishah Emperor to Salusa Secundus , Paul had to consolidate his power among the members of the Landsraad . He had sent his diplomats to negotiate with some of the noble Houses , while dispatching his most fanatical fighters against the defiant families . A number of lords would not lay down their arms and vowed to put up fierce resistance , claiming either that they would not follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . Regardless , the armies of Muad'Dib would sweep over them and continue onward . Though Paul sought to reduce and even eliminate the violence , he suspected that the bloody reality would prove far worse than any prescient vision . <br> And his visions had been frightening . <br> Centuries of decadence and mismanagement had filled the Imperium with deadwood  --  tinder that would allow his firestorm to spread with startling speed . In a more civilized time , problems between Houses had been settled with an old-fashioned War of Assassins , but that solution seemed quaint and gentlemanly now , no longer plausible . Faced with the tide of religious fervor approaching their worlds , some leaders would simply surrender , rather than try to stand against the invincible onslaught . <br> But not all of them would be that sensible . . . . <br> On their trek , Paul and his three companions wore new stillsuits covered by mottled cloaks to camouflage them in the desert . Though the garments looked well worn , they were actually finer than any Paul had used when he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that these durable offworld imports were superior to the simpler versions that had traditionally been made in hidden sietches . <br> The manufacturers mean well , he thought . They do it to show their support for me , without realizing the implied criticism in their " improvements . " <br> After selecting the perfect position high on the ridge , a small natural amphitheater guarded by tall rocks , Paul set down his pack . He uncinched the straps and pulled aside the cushioning folds of velvatin cloth with a reverence comparable to what he saw in the faces of his most devout followers . <br> In respectful silence he removed the clean , ivory-colored skull and several broken bone fragments  --  two ribs , an ulna , and a femur that had been brutally snapped in two , all of which the Fremen had preserved for years after the fall of Arrakeen to the Harkonnens . These were the remains of Duke Leto Atreides . <br> He saw nothing of his warm and wise father in the bones , yet they constituted an important symbol . Paul understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is long overdue . " <br> " I have already built a shrine to Leto in my mind , " Jessica said , " but it will be good to lay him to rest . " <br> Kneeling beside Paul , Chani helped him clear a spot among the large boulders , some of which had just begun to show a mottling of lichen . " We should keep this place a secret , Usul . Leave no marker , give no directions . We must protect your father 's resting place . " <br> " The mobs will not be kept at a distance , " Jessica said in a resentful tone . She shook her head . " No matter what we do , tourists will find their way here . It will be a circus , with guides wearing false Fremen clothing . Souvenir vendors will chip off flakes of rock , and countless charlatans will sell splinters of bone fragments , claiming that the objects come from Leto 's body . " <br> Chani looked both disturbed and awed . " Usul , have you foreseen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his private sietch name . <br> " History has foretold it , " Jessica answered for him , " time and time again . " <br> " And it must be done , to build the appropriate legend . " Alia spoke sternly to her mother . " The Bene Gesserit planned to use my brother in this way for their own purposes . Now he creates the legends himself , for his own purposes . " <br> Paul had already weighed the options . Some pilgrims would come here out of sincere devotion , while others would make the journey simply to boast that they had done it . Either way , they would come . He knew it would be folly to stop them , so he had to find another solution . " I will have my Fedaykin mount a round-the-clock vigil . No one will desecrate this shrine . " <br> He arranged the bones and carefully set the skull atop them , tilting it upward a little so that the hollow , empty sockets could look toward the cloudless blue sky . <br> " Alia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at either his sister or Jessica . " While we manage the business of war , we are also in the business of creating a myth . It is the only way we can accomplish what is necessary . Mere appeals to logic and common sense are not enough to sway the vast population of humankind . Irulan is uniquely talented in that area , as she has already demonstrated by the popularity of her history of my ascension to power . " <br> " You are cynical , Usul . " Chani sounded disturbed at the reminder that Paul 's wife , in name only , served any useful function at all . <br> " My brother is pragmatic , " Alia countered . <br> Paul stared for a long moment at the skull , imagining the face of his father : the aquiline nose , gray eyes , and an expression that could shift from anger toward his enemies to unmatched love for his son or Jessica . I learned so much from you , Father . You taught me honor and leadership . I only hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming years would go far beyond the greatest crises Duke Leto had ever confronted . Would the lessons apply on such a grand scale ? <br> Paul picked up a large rock and placed it in front of the skull , beginning the cairn . Then he gestured for his mother to set the second stone , which she did . In turn , Alia contributed to the pile , sounding wistful . " I miss my father . He loved us enough to die for us . " <br> " It 's too bad you never actually knew him , " Chani said quietly , placing her first rock on the cairn . <br> " Oh , but I did , " Alia said . " My pre- born memories encompass a trip my mother and father took to the Caladan wilderness after little Victor was killed . That was where Paul was conceived . " Alia often made eerie , unsettling comments . The lives crammed into her mind stretched far . She looked up at her mother . " You even caught a glimpse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jessica said . <br> Paul continued piling stones . As soon as the cairn completely covered his father 's bones , he stepped back to share a poignant , solitary moment with those who had loved Leto best . <br> Finally , Paul touched the communicator stud on the collar of his stillsuit . " Korba , we are ready for you now . " <br> Almost immediately , loud engines shattered the searing calm of the desert . Two ' thopters bearing the green-and-white Imperial crest of Emperor Muad'Dib rose from behind the sheer ridge and dipped their wings . The lead ' thopter was flown by the leader of Paul 's Fedaykin , Korba , a man who displayed his allegiance with religious fervor . Yet he was more than a mere sycophant  --  Korba was much too smart for that . All of his actions had carefully calculated consequences . <br> Behind the small fliers came a train of heavy-lift vehicles , with polished stone blocks dangling by suspensors beneath their bellies . The stone blocks , carved by artisans in Arrakeen , were embellished with intricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frieze of great events in the life of Duke Leto Atreides . Now that the respectful communication silence had been broken , squad commanders barked orders to their teams of laborers , calling them to begin their work at the new sacred site . <br> Silent and stoic , Jessica stared at the small cairn of rocks as if burning Leto 's shrine into her memory , rather than the monstrosity that was about to take shape . <br> The echoing noise of machinery reflected back upon the amphitheater of rocks . Korba landed his ' thopter and emerged , reveling in the grandiose production and proud of what he had arranged . He looked at the handmade pile of rocks and seemed to think it quaint . " Muad'Dib , we will create a proper monument here , worthy of your father . All must stand in awe of our Emperor and everyone who has been close to you . " <br> " Yes , they must , " Paul said , doubting that his Fedaykin commander would notice the wryness in his tone . Korba had become quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> The work teams threw themselves into the job like gaze hounds attacking prey . Since the haulers had no room to land in the small natural bowl at the top of the pass , the pilots disengaged their suspensor tethers and deposited the carved blocks on a flat , stony area , then retreated into the air . Paul 's advisers had designed the shrine memorial by committee and distributed the blueprints to all crew chiefs . The substantial pyramid would symbolize the foundation that Duke Leto had been in the life of Muad'Dib . <br> At the moment , though , as Paul considered this ostentatious memorial , he could think only of the dichotomy between his private feelings and his public image . Although he could not abdicate his role in the ever-growing machinery of government and religion around him , only a very few loved ones saw the real Paul . And even with this select group , he could not share everything . <br> Jessica stepped back and looked at him . Clearly , she had made up her mind about something . " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time for me to depart . " <br> " be . <br> " Caladan . I have been too long away from home . " <br> Paul felt a yearning in his own heart . Caladan had already accepted his rule , but he had not returned there since House Atreides had come to Arrakis . He looked at his mother , the stately , green-eyed beauty who had so captivated his gallant father . Though Paul was Emperor of the Known Universe , he should have realized the simple fact himself . " You are right , Mother . Caladan is part of my empire as well . I shall accompany you . " Excerpted from PAUL OF DUNE by Brian Herbert and Kevin J.
