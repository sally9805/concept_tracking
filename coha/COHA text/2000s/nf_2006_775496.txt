Preface // // The selection of issues that should rank high on the agenda of concern for human welfare and rights is , naturally , a subjective matter . But there are a few choices that seem unavoidable , because they bear so directly on the prospects for decent survival . Among them are at least these three : nuclear war , environmental disaster , and the fact that the government of the world ? s leading power is acting in ways that increase the likelihood of these catastrophes . It is important to stress the government , because the population , not surprisingly , does not agree . That brings up a fourth issue that should deeply concern Americans , and the world : the sharp divide between public opinion and public policy , one of the reasons for the fear , which can not casually be put aside , that " the American ? system ? as a whole is in real trouble  --  that it is heading in a direction that spells the end of its historic values of equality , liberty , and meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming to have some of the features of failed states , to adopt a currently fashionable notion that is conventionally applied to states regarded as potential threats to our security ( like Iraq ) or as needing our intervention to rescue the population from severe internal threats ( like Haiti ) . Though the concept is recognized to be " frustratingly imprecise , " some of the primary characteristics of failed states can be identified . One is their inability or unwillingness to protect their citizens from violence and perhaps even destruction . Another is their tendency to regard themselves as beyond the reach of domestic or international law , and hence free to carry out aggression and violence . And if they have democratic forms , they suffer from a serious " democratic deficit " that deprives their formal democratic institutions of real substance.2 // // Among the hardest tasks that anyone can undertake , and one of the most important , is to look honestly in the mirror . If we allow ourselves to do so , we should have little difficulty in finding the characteristics of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality should be deeply troubling to those who care about their countries and future generations . " Countries , " plural , because of the enormous reach of US power , but also because the threats are not localized in space or time . // // The first half of this book is devoted mostly to the increasing threat of destruction caused by US state power , in violation of international law , a topic of particular concern for citizens of the world dominant power , however one assesses the relevant threats . The second half is concerned primarily with democratic institutions , how they are conceived in the elite culture and how they perform in reality , both in " promoting democracy " abroad and shaping it at home . // // The issues are closely interlinked , and arise in several contexts . In discussing them , to save excessive footnoting I will omit sources when they can easily be found in recent books of mine.3 // //
