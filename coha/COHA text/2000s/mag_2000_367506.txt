From the outside , Meritanordbanken in Helsinki looks like a typical staid European bank . Merita 's ornate headquarters hall , with its rose marble columns and gilded cornices , harks back to the 19th century , when the Czar of Russia still ruled Finland . But do n't be fooled . Behind the historic decor , Merita has become one of the world 's most advanced banks , using the Internet and mobile phones to conduct most of its business . Some 1.2 million of its customers use the Web to bank , a world record , while only 6% of the institution 's transactions are processed through a traditional branch . What 's more , Merita has taken the lead in allowing customers to bank via mobile phones . Not bad for a bank with just $173 billion in assets , only Europe 's 25th largest . <P> All this high-tech prowess is a matter of necessity . MeritaNordbanken controls about 40% of Finland 's banking market , so a merger with another domestic bank to cut costs was out of the question on antitrust grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile and Internet technology to cut overhead , and become Europe 's most aggressive bank in expanding across borders . In April it completed a merger with Denmark 's Unidanmark three years after Merita joined forces with Sweden 's Nordbanken . The deals have made Merita the largest bank in Scandinavia . " We see ourselves as a pan-Nordic bank with a very powerful distribution network , " says Vesa Vainio , who became chairman in April . <P> Bo Harald , a Merita executive vice president , estimates that an Internet transaction costs the bank only 11cents , a tenth the cost of a local branch transaction . And every month customers make 4.1 million bill payments over the Internet . The migration to the Net also allowed Merita to close two-thirds of its 800 branches , resulting in huge savings . <P> Merita 's bid to become Northern Europe 's phone-in bank of the future depends a lot on the latest technology . Customers can use cutting-edge wireless application protocol ( WAP ) browsers , built into the latest generation of European phones , which allow customers to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can check account balances , pay bills , transfer money and even buy shares on the Finnish stock market . <P> And more is on the way . One service already attracting a lot of attention is a pilot project between MeritaNordbanken , the Finnish cell-phone maker Nokia , and Visa International , the credit-card company . Nokia will soon have available in Finland cell phones that contain two chips , one for mobile-telephone service and one from Visa that adds a nifty credit-card function to the handset . The Visa chip will allow a customer to hold the phone near a cash register and push a button to pay a bill rather than having a clerk swipe a credit card . The digital mobile phone can replace the customer 's signature as well . <P> Perhaps Merita 's greatest accomplishment so far has been in getting customers to pay for all its services , which even some U.S. banks are giving away to encourage Web use . " The customer does n't realize its value if you do n't charge , " says Harald . Maybe that 's one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe how MeritaNordbanken is using technology . <P>  --  By Charles P.
