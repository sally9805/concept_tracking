The first time Dr. Paul Ridker appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine , he was n't yet a doctor . In fact , he had n't even graduated from high school . <P> That 's because Ridker made his debut in the prestigious medical journal not as an author but as a research subject . He was nine years old , just returned from living in India and suffering from symptoms that none of his doctors could explain . He became the subject of a study at the National Institutes of Health , where doctors finally diagnosed his problem  --  a novel immune disorder that allowed certain parasites in his body to flourish  --  and published their findings . Ridker 's curiosity was piqued  --  permanently . " My first real exposure to medicine was at such a high level of research , with these talented physicians trying to understand why this young boy was having so many problems , it made medicine exciting to me , " he says . <P> More than 30 years later , Ridker 's name appears regularly in the NEJM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiologist at Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital and one of the world 's leading experts on arterial inflammation , an immune-system reaction that is the most powerful contributor after cholesterol to heart attacks . A variation on the immune response that causes everything from arthritis to sinus infections , inflammation in the arteries turns out to be as dangerous for the heart as high cholesterol levels in the blood . " Inflammation has really changed our whole outlook on heart disease , " says Dr. Eric Topol , a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic . <P> New ideas challenging the simple plumbing model of heart disease were beginning to percolate through the medical establishment even as Ridker began his residency in 1984 . The idea that heart attacks are caused by arteries gummed up with cholesterol was clearly inadequate ; half of all heart attacks occurred in people with normal cholesterol levels . <P> If cholesterol could not explain all heart attacks , then Ridker was determined to find out what else could . His childhood experience with his own immune disorder and his yearlong fellowship in sub-Saharan Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sweep around the globe , convinced him that preventing disease was as important as treating conditions once they occurred . <P> So he combed through the few early reports that hinted at the identity of some of cholesterol 's co-conspirators . Inflammation seemed the most promising , and three years ago Ridker launched the first large-scale studies designed both to confirm inflammation 's role in heart attacks and provide doctors with a useful , reliable way of measuring its effect in the arteries . Few of his colleagues , however , believed that the low levels of inflammation thought to cause trouble in the heart ( far below the peaks involved in arthritis or infections ) could be tracked reliably with a substance in the blood . " There were many naysayers , " Ridker admits . <P> Indeed , choosing a reliable gauge for how inflamed the arteries had become proved daunting . After running through a few common but ineffective markers , Ridker finally settled on C-reactive protein , a substance that could be detected , even at low levels , with a special , highly sensitive assay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
