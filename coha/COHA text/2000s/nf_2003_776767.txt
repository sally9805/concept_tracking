The Great South Sea // Most sailors did not refer to it as the Pacific Ocean . They called it the South Sea , a name that dated back to 1513 when Vasco N ? ? as de Balboa ventured across the sliver of mountainous , jungle-choked terrain known as the Isthmus of Panama . The isthmus runs west to east so that when Balboa first glimpsed water , it appeared to extend to the south . Quite sensibly , he dubbed his discovery the Great South Sea . // Seven years later , Ferdinand Magellan and his men , on their way to the first circumnavigation of the world , penetrated the mazelike strait at the craggy bottom of South America . After weathering the terrible gales typical of one of the most inhospitable places on earth , they found themselves in a quiet , vast ocean that Magellan called , with tearful thanks to God , the Pacific-a name that would not catch hold until the mid-nineteenth century . // Balboa found it , Magellan named it , but for any young boy taken with tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be James Cook . It had been Cook who had first crisscrossed the Pacific , discovering islands at almost every turn . Cook had been a product of the Enlightenment 's search for knowledge through the empirical observation of nature . Although not trained as a scientist , he was one of the most expert nautical surveyors in the British navy , a skill that served him well in his voyages to distant lands . First and foremost , however , Cook had been an explorer , and the Pacific had served as his route to glory . For the young Wilkes , the South Sea came to represent not only a means of escape from an unhappy childhood but , even more important , a way to win the praise and adulation he had been craving for as long as he could remember . // Wilkes was born to well-to-do parents in New York City in 1798 . When his mother died just two years later , he was placed in the care of an aunt , Elizabeth Ann Seton , who would later convert to Catholicism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first native-born saint . Wilkes 's exposure to sainthood proved short-lived , however . At just four years old , he was sent away to boarding school . When he realized he was about to be abandoned at the school , Wilkes clung to his father 's leg and refused to let go . " Young as I was , " he wrote , " the impression is still on me &amp; it is the first event of my life that I have any distinct recollection of . " // For the next ten years , Wilkes was , in his own words , " a poor castaway boy , " attending a series of boarding schools that he hated , always yearning to be at home with the father he loved . The one maternal figure in Wilkes 's life was a nanny named Mammy Reed-a fat , dark-eyed Welsh woman who , in stark contrast to his earlier caretaker , had a reputation as a witch . Reed 's gaze was so intense that Wilkes claimed , " It was impossible to meet her stare . " Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a black hole of loneliness at the center of his being . " I had no other companions than my books and teachers , " he remembered . // But there was always the sea . Manhattan was surrounded by water , and hull to hull along the waterfront was a restless wooden exoskeleton of ships , their long bowsprits nuzzling over the busy streets , the eyes of even the most jaundiced New Yorker irresistibly drawn skyward into a complex forest of spars and rigging . This was where a boy might turn his back on all that he had once known and step into an exotic dream of adventure , freedom , opportunity , and risk . // The city 's wealthiest merchant , John Jacob Astor , had made his fortune with these ships . For Astor , who became known as the Prince of the China Trade , it began , in large part , with sea otter skins procured in the Pacific Northwest-a trade made possible by Wilkes 's hero , James Cook . After discovering countless Pacific islands and plunging farther south than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final time in 1776 to find the proverbial Northwest Passage . Earlier mariners had unsuccessfully searched the east coast of North America for a waterway that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Cook , by now the most experienced and respected explorer in the world , would try the west coast . As the American Revolution raged on the continent 's opposite shore , Cook traded for sea otter skins with Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest . At the time , he had no other intention than to use the skins to manufacture some winter clothing for his crew . Later in the voyage , after Cook was killed by natives in Hawaii , his men sailed for China and were astounded to learn that an otter skin purchased for pennies in Nootka Sound sold for a hundred dollars in Canton . // Internal trade policies made it difficult for English merchants to capitalize on this discovery . Britain 's South Sea Company had a monopoly for trade on the west coast of America , while the East India Company controlled the Chinese market . For an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to possess two expensive and hard-to-get licenses . Enter the Americans . // Soon after the secret of sea otter skins was revealed by the publication of the narrative of Cook 's final voyage in 1784 , American China traders , many of them from Boston and Salem , set out around Cape Horn bound for the Pacific Northwest . In the decades to come , it would be Astor , the New Yorker , who established the first permanent white settlement in the region , known as Astoria on the Columbia River , not far from where Lewis and Clark had wintered in 1805-6 . The outpost served as a gathering point for Astor 's fleet of ten vessels . One of these ships , the Tonquin , became part of the mythology of a frontier that for children of Wilkes 's age was what the Wild West would become for subsequent generations of Americans . // On June 5 , 1811 , the Tonquin , under the command of Captain Jonathan Thorn , sailed from Astoria in search of otter skins . Not until more than a year later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Astoria and tell the tale of what had happened to the missing ship . They had anchored somewhere in the vicinity of Vancouver Island 's Clayoquot Sound . Captain Thorn quickly angered the local natives by offering an insultingly low price for their otter skins . The following day , as the Tonquin ' s crew began to weigh anchor and set the sails , the natives attacked . Almost all the sailors on deck , including Captain Thorn , were bludgeoned and stabbed to death . Some of the men in the rigging were able to lower themselves through an open hatchway down into the ship , where they secured some pistols and muskets and began firing at the natives . Soon they had cleared the decks . // The next morning several canoes made their way to the Tonquin . The night before a group of sailors had slipped away in the ship 's launch and headed for Astoria . They would never be heard from again . The only man left aboard was a severely injured sailor who did not have long to live . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indians , then took a match to the ship 's magazine of gunpowder . The Tonquin and approximately a hundred natives were blown to smithereens . // With the outbreak of the War of 1812 , when Charles Wilkes was fourteen , a different kind of violence threatened Astor 's commercial interests in the Northwest . A British naval vessel was dispatched to the region , and Astor had no choice but to sell his outpost to the English . Closer to home , however , the United States pulled off several stunning victories as the Constitution and United States bested British frigates in the waters off the East Coast . In the meantime , Captain David Porter rounded the Horn in the U.S. frigate Essex and proceeded to wage his own private war in the Pacific . Playing cat and mouse with the British navy , Porter and his men terrorized the enemy 's whaling fleet . Porter 's swashbuckling exploits climaxed in a bloody encounter with two British frigates off Valparaiso , Chile . Porter was ultimately defeated , but he and his men did much to proclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teenager of Wilkes 's interests , it was a tremendously exciting time . Today it is difficult to appreciate the level of patriotism commonly felt by those of Wilkes 's generation , many of whose fathers were fighting in the War of 1812 and whose grandfathers had fought in the Revolution . Freshly minted naval heroes such as Stephen Decatur and Isaac Hull were regularly f ? ted in New York , and Wilkes became enamored with the glittering regalia of a captain 's dress uniform . Mammy Reed , the Welsh witch , foretold that Wilkes would one day become an admiral . When he pointed out that the U.S. Navy did not grant a rank higher than captain ( although the complementary title of commodore was used when a captain commanded a squadron ) , Reed insisted that her prediction would come true . // As the war drew to a close , Wilkes , now sixteen years old , began to press his father to apply for a midshipman 's warrant . Under usual circumstances , the Wilkes family had all the social and political connections required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the daughter of William Seton , a wealthy New York merchant ; his father was the grandson of an even wealthier British distiller . His father 's uncle , John Wilkes , a member of Parliament , had gained international fame for his outspoken support of the American cause during the Revolution . Wilkes 's own father , whose middle name was de Pointhieu , had aristocratic relatives in Paris with close ties to the French navy . // But in 1815 not even this impressive pedigree could guarantee a midshipman 's appointment . With the end of the war , the navy found itself overloaded with officers . Prospects of peace meant that the number of naval vessels would only decrease . For decades to come the opportunities available to young naval officers would remain disappointingly meager . James Fenimore Cooper , the noted author and a former naval officer who would pen a history of the U.S. Navy , wrote Wilkes 's father that there was , Wilkes remembered , " no more likelihood of my being appointed than the heavens should fall to catch larks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who wanted him to become a businessman like himself . By this time , Wilkes was enrolled as a day student at a preparatory school for Columbia College and was showing remarkable promise in mathematics and languages . But no matter how much his father attempted to convince his son that he should stay ashore , dangling before him the prospect of a promising job with his uncle at the Bank of New York , Wilkes 's " hankering after naval life &amp; roving life still grew stronger &amp; stronger . " // Wilkes began studying with Jonathan Garnett , the editor of the American Nautical Almanac . Garnett familiarized the boy with the various mathematical formulae , tables , and solutions associated with navigation ; he taught him how to read nautical charts and how to use navigational instruments . He even gave Wilkes his own sextant , which the boy learned how to take apart and put back together . " Before I put my foot on the deck of a vessel , " he wrote , " I felt capable of navigating &amp; directing her course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wilkes would subscribe to in the years ahead : book-learning , at least his version of book-learning , was more than a match for anyone else 's practical experience . // Failing to secure an outright commission , Wilkes made an application for a midshipman 's warrant contingent on his first gaining relevant sea experience in the merchant marine . Reluctantly , Wilkes 's father agreed to let him go , hopeful that the contrast between New York society and the forecastle of a merchant vessel would bring the boy to his senses . " I shall never forget the first time I dressed in my Sailors Jacket &amp; trousers , " Wilkes wrote , " the vanity and pride I felt . " When he showed the outfit to his father , he was " greatly astonished to see the tears starting from his eyes . " // Just a few days into his first voyage aboard the Hibernia , one of hundreds of vessels carrying goods and passengers between America and Europe , Wilkes understood why his father had been moved to tears . " A more ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " he remembered . His hands were continually bleeding ; his bowels were reacting cataclysmically to the harsh shipboard fare ; and even worse , the jacket and trousers he had taken such pride in were smeared with tar . " ould I have set my foot on shore , " he wrote , " I never would have again consented to be again afloat . " // Despite his suffering , Wilkes could not help but be fascinated by the spectacle of a fully rigged ship under sail . " I had from my reading become acquainted with many of the maneuvers , " he wrote , " and took great delight in watching how things were done practically . " The captain heard that Wilkes knew how to perform a lunar-a complicated series of observations to determine a ship 's longitude that required as many as three hours of calculations and was beyond the abilities of many captains in the merchant service . " Although I had little practice at sea , " Wilkes wrote , " I readily came to take good &amp; satisfactory observations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man 's abilities , assuring the paying passengers that he would , in Wilkes 's words , " make me a good navigator . " Wilkes was infuriated by the captain 's deception , but his time would come . // Not long into the voyage , the captain revealed to Wilkes that , incredibly , he had forgotten to bring his charts . He asked the boy if he might be able to draw a chart of the English Channel from memory . Revealing an early willingness to take on a seemingly hopeless task , Wilkes agreed to give it a try . " The next day I was called into the cabin and sheets of letter paper handed me . " He hurriedly sketched out a fairly detailed representation of the English Channel-and stunningly , with Wilkes 's map in hand , the captain was able to guide the Hibernia to Le Havre , France , without incident . // On his return to New York , Wilkes was still angry at the treatment he 'd received during the voyage , especially from the captain . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors , feeling " great disgust when I looked back on the troubles I had gone through and the low company I was thrown with . " For the young Wilkes , it was now a matter of pride . In spite of , or perhaps because of , the adversity he had encountered , he would continue on until he received his commission . Years later he would write , " I have little doubt now that if the treatment I had received had been opposite to what it had been I would have abandoned the idea of following the sea life . //
