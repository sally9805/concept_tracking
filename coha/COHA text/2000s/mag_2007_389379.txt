Staying hydrated is the key to remaining alert and energetic in the outdoors . The human body 's dependence on water is so powerful that it takes only a few days without it for a person to die . If you 're exerting yourself , the temperature is high or you 're hunting or fishing at high elevation , it 'll be only a matter of hours before you begin to feel the effects of dehydration . The symptoms come on slowly and silently , and unless you 're paying attention , you wo n't notice that it 's happening . Your blood thickens and your body 's blood volume is reduced . Your pulse speeds up as your heart is forced to work harder to move enough blood through your body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to every cell . You become exhausted . Your mind ceases to function well , and you begin to make errors in judgment that could lead to injury or death . But even without mistakes , death comes soon enough , unless you can find a good source of water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water you need depends on several things : your level of exertion , the ambient temperature , the humidity , the elevation , your level of fitness , your overall health and time . If you are ill or out of shape and are overexerting yourself , and if the heat and humidity are high , you 're bound to experience problems with dehydration . The only way to prevent it is to slow down , avoid sweating and drink plenty of water . During hot weather , dehydration is associated with such problems as heat cramps , exhaustion and stroke . But you can also fall victim to dehydration during cold weather . In fact , cold-weather dehydration is , in some ways , more insidious , because it sneaks up on you . In cool weather , you tend not to feel as thirsty , so you do n't drink as much . A somewhat loose field diagnosis of your level of dehydration can be made , in both summer and winter , by monitoring the quantity and the color of your urine . The more dehydrated you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine becomes a darker yellow as dehydration becomes worse . Ideally , urine should be clear to very light yellow . ( Keep in mind that some dietary supplements , such as vitamin B , can also darken your urine . ) Just pay attention , and if your urine gets darker , know that dehydration might be getting severe . SIP CONTINUOUSLY Do n't wait until you feel thirsty before you take a drink , and keep drinking even though your thirst has been satisfied . It sounds strange , but thirst is actually a poor gauge of how much you should drink . Along with drinking more water , slow your pace to prevent sweating . Hike slowly , take frequent breaks and lie low during the hottest part of the day . Adjust your clothing and the gear you 're packing to help reduce the amount you 're perspiring . Fatigue , muscle cramps , trouble sleeping and irritability are all symptoms of dehydration . Before turning to stimulants , sleeping pills , muscle relaxants or something else to make you feel better , reach for the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way toward making your outing more enjoyable , and will keep you from spiraling down the dangerous path toward serious dehydration . BOX DEGREES OF DEHYDRATION One way to monitor your level of dehydration is by tracking changes in your body weight . Of course , this can be rather difficult to do in the field without a scale , but understanding what happens to us physiologically when we lose a percentage of our body weight in water is enlightening . The following chart is based on the dehydration of a 200-pound person . 2% DROP IN BODY WEIGHT ( 4 pounds of water , or less than 2 liters ) SYMPTOMS : Thirst , fatigue , weakness , vague discomfort and loss of appetite are the first symptoms to appear . 4% DROP IN BODY WEIGHT ( roughly a gallon ) SYMPTOMS : Reduced physical performance , dry mouth , reduction in urine output , flushed skin , impatience , confusion and apathy . 5% DROP IN BODY WEIGHT ( some symptoms take place at 6% ) SYMPTOMS : Difficulty thinking , headache , irritability , sleepiness , difficulty keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DROP IN BODY WEIGHT ( some symptoms occur at 8  --  10% ) SYMPTOMS : Dizziness , spastic muscles , loss of balance , delirium , exhaustion and collapse . Heat stroke is a distinct possibility , and death is not far behind . BOX Replenishing Fluid Loss What to drink is sometimes a matter of controversy . Hunters and fishermen can only carry so much liquid with them , and that liquid should be water . Sports drinks are great for athletes who are involved in endurance events , when those drinks can be matched by an equal amount of water intake . They are not a substitute for water . Most sports drinks are crammed with carbohydrates in the form of sugars , to replace lost glycogen . Some offer electrolyte-replacement minerals , but it 's better to carry powdered electrolyte replacements , such as Emergen-C or Electro Mix ( both by Alacer and available at grocery or health food stores ) , which can be added to your water to replace lost body salts . By no means drink alcohol , as it only exacerbates dehydration . Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if you do n't feel thirsty .
