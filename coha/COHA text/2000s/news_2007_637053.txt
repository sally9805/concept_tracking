<p> One of the most aggressive advertising innovators in metro Atlanta is n't a Fortune 500 company or a scrappy Internet upstart . It 's MARTA , the regional transit system , which is selling space on its buses , trains and rail stations with the gusto of a NASCAR racing team . <p> Ads are shown on video screens hanging from rail platforms and on televisions bolted inside buses and rail cars . Buses and trains have been wrapped to create rolling billboards touting everything from new condominium towers to bail bondsmen . The transit system was the first in the nation to place ads inside subway tunnels in a way that creates short moving pictures for riders in passing trains . <p> This month , MARTA is pushing the envelope again , becoming the first to wrap buses in ads made from a special material that glows in the dark . <p> Glowing buses ? Subway movies ? TVs on trains ? Welcome to advertising , 21st century style . <p> Companies are finding they must try new marketing techniques to stand out in today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor at Georgia State University . <p> " The key is how do you get noticed , and doing nontraditional things is a very effective way to get noticed , " he said . <p> Marketers say MARTA is a good vehicle for companies because the transit system 's ridership skews young , the most coveted demographic for advertisers . And the 100,000 to 120,000 passengers who ride the system each day are a captive audience , with time to kill whether waiting for a train or riding on a bus . <p> Of course , MARTA is n't the only nontraditional place ads are showing up . They 're being beamed onto TV screens mounted in elevators , posted above urinals in bathrooms and , increasingly , disguised as e-mails from friends and colleagues . <p> But in MARTA , marketers have found an eager participant in the new advertising game . Until recently , the transit system has been struggling to make ends meet and desperate for new revenue streams . The economic downturn after the Sept. 11 attacks eroded MARTA 's primary income stream , sales tax collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unlike most transit systems , MARTA gets no operating money from the state . Advertising brings in about $5 million a year for MARTA , a relatively small percentage of the transit system 's $324 million operating budget . But it 's an area poised to grow , said Tony Griffin , MARTA 's director of marketing . <p> " The revenue has n't been what we hoped it would be , but we hope down the road we 've opened up a nice revenue source for the future , " Griffin said . <p> MARTA was the nation 's first transit system to put television screens in rail cars , and remains the only system with electronic signs in all rail stations . <p> " MARTA is a leader in terms of trying stuff , " said Wendell Reilly , CEO of Atlanta-based SignPost Networks , which is paying MARTA about $144,000 a year to hang digital display screens throughout the rail system . <p> MARTA does n't sell ads , leaving that work to advertising and media companies who pay the transit system for the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail stations . MARTA does n't pay for the equipment but does receive a percentage of ad sales . <p> Griffin stresses that the video and TV screens do much more than show ads . <p> The rail station monitors , for instance , provide riders with a steady stream of news , from sports scores to local headlines , sandwiched between short ad spots . At the bottom of the screen , a new feature counts down the minutes until the next train arrives . The bus TVs air local news reports , entertainment programs and MARTA news . <p> Sidney Daniels , 48 , a regular MARTA bus rider , said he likes the feature . <p> " It 's entertainment , " he said . " It 's convenient to everybody . " <p> Advertising on MARTA has worked well for one small Atlanta company , Free at Last bail bonds , which has been putting its logo on MARTA buses since November 2005 . <p> Business has gone up , prompting the company to sign a second yearlong contract . About half of Free at Last 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jennifer Greene-Dallam , the company 's CEO . <p> The ads are successful because it takes little effort to watch a bus rolling by , she said . <p> " The Yellow Pages , you have to actually open the book , " she said . " Hopefully , you 've seen our bus running on the streets . It 's brand recognition . " <p> Until the 1990s , MARTA took a restrained approach to advertising . Buses completely wrapped in ads did n't become common until just before the 1996 Summer Olympics . <p> MARTA 's advertising thirst does have limits . MARTA has no plans to sell naming rights for a rail station . Liquor ads are not permitted , either . <p> The subway tunnel ads remain a pilot project . No plans are in the works to make the ads a permanent part of MARTA 's arsenal , officials said . The lone subway ad in place , for Lexus , is scheduled to be removed within three months . <p> At least one MARTA board member , the Rev. Walter Kimbrough , says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If you see a MARTA bus that is wrapped , you do n't really know that it 's a MARTA bus , " he said , noting that suburban bus systems have begun running in downtown and Midtown in recent years . " There will be markings on it , but you really have to look for that . And the uniformity is gone . " <p> Reilly , the SignPost CEO , says the 145 digital screens he 's installed in MARTA rail stations reach about 300,000 individual viewers each week  --  a figure measured by Arbitron , the same agency that monitors radio station listenership . If SignPost was a radio station , Reilly boasts it would rank among the top 10 in metro Atlanta . <p> To attract viewers , SignPost broadcasts news and information in 10-minute loops and developed the " next train " feature , what Reilly calls his " killer app . " Short ads are shown every 10 to 20 minutes . The information 's providers include CNN , The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Reuters . SignPost gets the information free , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to MARTA riders . <p> " What we 're trying to do is give the MARTA rider the same thing that the automobile rider has , which is a radio , " Reilly said . " It 's visual radio .
