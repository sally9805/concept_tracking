In my work as a cardiovascular surgeon , I use the most sophisticated tools of modern medicine to separate patients from their diseased hearts and replace these organs with healthy ones . While my training was in the science of the Western world , I also rely heavily on an ancient Eastern technique  --  meditation  --  to help my patients prepare for surgery and to steer them gently toward recovery . Why ? Because it works . <P> Every patient who comes to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City for a heart operation is offered an optional program of massage , yoga and meditation . We sell specially prepared 90-minute audiotapes in which a calm voice speaks over gentle strains of New Age music and urges patients to remember a place where they felt happy and comfortable . <P> Americans tend to be very self-conscious about this sort of thing . Some patients do n't even want to close their eyes . But surgery gives people an incentive to try new things , and a significant percentage of our patients take us up on our offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which some patients get tapes like these and others get sham mantras  --  meaningless scripts of random phrases . What we 've discovered is that the words do n't matter . The patients who do the best  --  in terms of managing pain and reducing anxiety  --  are the ones who use the tapes , real or sham . <P> What 's going on ? Several things at once , I suspect . At a hormonal level , studies have shown that meditation can counteract the fight-or-flight response that floods the body with the stress hormone cortisol and that also shuts down the parasympathetic system , which normally restores order after the alert is over . At a molecular level , meditation slows metabolism in red blood cells and suppresses the production of cytokines  --  proteins associated with the kind of heightened immune response often seen in stressed-out subjects such as students taking exams . <P> If you have ever seen footage of Buddhist monks sitting in the Himalayan snow , warming cold towels draped over their shoulders and back with body heat generated by meditation , you have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The monks can manipulate their metabolism to redirect the body 's energy from warming its core to heating its surface ; the drop in internal metabolic rate is well documented . Similar results have been observed in studies of patients having surgery ; patients who meditated experienced less operative bleeding than controls given placebos . <P> Meditation also reduces the impact of several peculiarly Western diseases . Studies have shown that meditation can reduce hardening of the arteries , especially in African Americans with high blood pressure . People suffering from anxiety disorders also appreciate the lowered stress , reduced blood pressure and slowed heart rates associated with meditation . Similarly , there is growing evidence that a meditation program can have a positive , sustained effect on chronic pain and mood , including depression and anxiety . In an even more dramatic example , initial research has suggested that meditation combined with dietary changes may slow tumor progression in prostate-cancer patients .
