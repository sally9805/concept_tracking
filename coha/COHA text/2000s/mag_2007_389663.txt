First , Lower Your Expectations BY TOM CHIARELLA I hate new fathers . Bunch of arrogant know-it-alls , smug in what they clearly perceive to be the singular glow of the creation of their loins . You have to look at the baby , " talk " to their toddler . I just want to shake them  --  those fathers . I want to tell them : Kids get hurt . Kids get sick . Kids make bad , bad choices . Do n't smile at me knowingly when we pass in the park just because you can afford a really expensive European stroller . You do n't have a clue . Photograph : Illustration by Andy Martin The expectation of safety and normalcy ? Forget that stuff . Put it out of your mind . To be a good father , you have to give up the expectation of a payoff . Forget trophies and medals . Forget report cards , even . You have to observe . You have to listen . You are a large figure in this person 's life . No getting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of becoming smaller . This both protects them and teaches you . And do n't be overly proud of your own parental habits . You 'll get your chance to tell it like it is , to lay down the law . Fathers do . Just do n't relish that , because that shit can snap you in half when it backfires , and you will be old when it does , and so will they . Old enough to wander away . When I look at pictures of myself as a young father  --  joyfully lifting my son by one arm at a picnic somewhere , indifferently sleeping with him on a long-gone couch , watching , arms folded , as he played soccer  --  I think what a dope I was . I remember that I thought it would be easier when I did n't have to change diapers , or that I 'd have more time for myself once they were in school , or that things would be much better once the younger one outgrew his asthma . What was my rush ? Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hope for change ? I had a son . Then I had another one . I should have opened my eyes wider every day to snap myself out of the torpor of pride and pleasure ; I should have used every day to think about what I did n't know about being a father . And I should have sat there awhile in stillness , flush in the lessons provided by the company of my sons , then  --  as now  --  the most quarrelsome and deep pleasure I 'll ever know .

How to Teach Your Kid to Throw a Knuckleball BY TIM WAKEFIELD , PITCHER , BOSTON RED SOX AS TOLD TO MAUREEN MULLEN Grip the ball with your thumb and ring finger , placing the nails and tips of your index and middle fingers inside the horseshoe of the laces . Place the ball against your palm . * I throw it with a really stiff wrist . I let it go with my thumb and ring finger and guide it out with my index and middle fingers . So it 's kind of like simul-taneously letting go and guiding . * You let go of the ball that way to eliminate spin . The natural rotation of the ball when you throw it is backspin . You do n't want any spin . * My follow-through is a little shorter than for a conventional pitcher . Even though you 're using the mechanics of throwing , it 's more of a shove to the plate than a throw to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from spinning . * Then you just hope the ball does what it 's supposed to .

HARVEY KARP , PEDIATRICIAN , CREATOR , THE HAPPIEST BABY ON THE BLOCK BOOK AND DVD The goal : Re-create the continuous sensory stimulation the baby experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Swaddling ( shown ) : Place baby 's arms at his sides . Fold a big , square blanket using the " dudu " wrapping pattern ( down , up , down , up ) to ensure a snug fit . Side : The back is the only position for sleep , but it 's the worst position to calm crying . Roll the baby sideways and slightly onto the stomach , to activate the soothing position sensors in the middle ear . Shushing : This is meant to imitate the sound of blood flow in the uterus , which is twice as loud as a vacuum cleaner when the baby is in the womb . Shush directly in the baby 's ear as loud as he is crying . Lower the level as he begins to quiet down . Swinging : Move the baby about an inch back and forth in a quick jiggle vibration , creating rhythmic motion . The baby can be over your shoulder , in your arms , or on your lap . The head should move a little like a bobble-head doll 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is just a slight jiggle . Sucking : On a finger or pacifier . The baby will love this  --  unless , of course , he 's already asleep by now . WHAT I 'VE LEARNED : FATHER- HOOD FROM ESQUIRE 'S ARCHIVES My mother used to say to me when I was a kid : " I 'd throw myself in front of a truck for you . " Over and over again . I did n't know what the hell she was talking about . " What do you mean , you want to throw . . . you 'll die . " I say that to my kids now . GENE SIMMONS , ROCK STAR The other night I was walking down the stairs behind one of my daughters . I was tired , and she was goofing around , you know , like kids do , doing all this stupid stuff on the stairs . And I was thinking , Please just go down the stairs and let 's get you to bed . It 's after your bedtime . I 've had enough for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I snapped out of it . I was like , Dude , you should be dancing down the stairs behind her ! FOREST WHITAKER , ACTOR If you want your kids to listen to you , do n't yell at them . Whisper . Make them lean in . My kids taught me that . MARIO BATALI , CHEF When guys come over to date my daughter , I 'm going to tell them , " I want you to go out and have a very good time . If you abuse her in any way , I 'm going to kill your mother and father , cut your back open , pull out your spine , and leave you in a wheelchair so you can think about what you did for the rest of your life . Now , go out and have a good time !
