<p> Myungjoo Lee puts a pack of slender enoki mushrooms in her cart at the Super H-Mart in Duluth , next to the yucca root , cucumbers and green peppers . <p> The Dunwoody resident , originally from Korea , makes a weekly trek for her fix of fresh veggies from this particular supermarket . <p> Korean-owned Super H-Mart , which opened two years ago , is an Asian specialty grocery with the sorts of ethnic foods one might find at the DeKalb Farmer 's Market but with the upscale feel of a Whole Foods . <p> Huge bins of oranges , apples , pears and eggplants greet shoppers . The food court offers steaming bowls of spicy tofu soup . Asian vegetables abound , like fresh lily bulbs , lemon grass , banana flowers and water chestnuts with green roots . Signs are in both Korean and English . <p> While Kroger , Publix and Wal-Mart still dominate the grocery market in metro Atlanta , Super H-Mart is betting that the buying power of suburban Asian professionals is strong enough to build on . <p> The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Suwanee and Doraville in the next two years . Just last month , it opened a store in Riverdale and plans to give away a 2007 Mercedes-Benz ML500 to a lucky shopper to celebrate the 100th day of business . <p> Super H-Mart now has 22 stores nationwide , including concentrations in New York , New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic seaboard . Metro Atlanta  --  a magnet for Asian migration and investment  --  represents a new concentration in the South . <p> People are moving to metro Atlanta from cities like Los Angeles and New York , said John Lee , project manager for Super H-Mart 's expansion . They sell homes in those high-priced markets and have enough money to buy a home here and open a business too , Lee said . <p> In Gwinnett County alone , there are more than 66,000 Asians , according to 2005 census data . Asian buying power in Gwinnett County has increased more than 1,000 percent in the past 15 years , reaching $1.8 billion last year , according to a study by the University of Georgia . <p> Shopper Myungjoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from St. Louis because her husband got a job here as a mortgage broker . <p> The couple saw that the area 's Asian community was strong , with good stores to serve it . <p> " St. Louis does n't have a big Asian market , " Lee said as she shopped at Super H-Mart . <p> ' They beat us out ' <p> Metro Atlanta has many now , most Korean-owned . There 's the Buford Highway Farmer 's Market , the Assi Plaza in Suwanee and the Gwinnett International Farmers Market , to name a few . <p> When the upscale $22 million Park Village , which Super H-Mart anchors , opened in 2004 it was a signal that Asian investment , and Korean investment in particular , was starting to rise . <p> " Everywhere you look it 's mainly Korean , " said Nicole Wong , a Lawrenceville resident of Chinese heritage who shops at Super H-Mart once a week . <p> " They beat us out big time , " she said of Korean vs . Chinese investment in the Duluth area . <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway , Wong said . Super H-Mart is catering to a very suburban , and increasingly upscale , crowd . The Duluth location is near a bustling intersection of commerce , including a Wal-Mart Supercenter . The 60,000-square-foot store definitely says supermarket rather than corner grocery . And Lee said plans for the new store in Johns Creek are " much more high-end style " than the Duluth location . <p> The store , in the former Kroger at Abbotts Bridge Road and Medlock Bridge Road , should open this summer , Lee said . It will feature a 124-foot glass display case for live fish , decorative touches such as stone wall tiles and a snazzier food court than the Duluth location . <p> The Suwanee store , slated to open early next year , will occupy a former Ingles and will compete with the nearby Assi Market , another Korean-owned grocery chain . In Doraville , Super H-Mart will anchor what is slated to be an international shopping mall with an Asian theme beside the Brandsmart on I-285 , Lee said . That store could open the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The question of whether Atlanta 's suburbs can handle so many Korean and Asian markets is n't worrying Lee . <p> " We do n't consider we have any competitors , " Lee said . " Our style is different from American groceries . It 's even different from other Asian markets , which may focus heavily on food from one particular country . " <p> Super H-Mart offers foods from South Korea , Japan , China , Vietnam and Taiwan . The store focuses on fresh fruits , vegetables and fish at a low price  --  items attractive to the Asian palate and increasingly so to non-Asians as well . And that may be key . <p> Semoon Chang , a professor of economics at the University of South Alabama , says Super H-Mart and other Asian supermarkets , to maintain a hold in the Atlanta market , will have to accommodate non-Asian customers in order to survive . <p> Lorrie Griffith , editor of the Shelby Report , a monthly grocery industry trade publication in Gainesville , agreed . Griffith said the curiosity factor will draw some in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food is fresh . " <p> The challenge will be to draw mainstream consumers into the packaged-food section , where the foods may be " intimidating " or confusing to non-Asian consumers , Griffith said . <p> Super-H Mart does draw from across cultures . Gladys Hernandez of Lawrenceville stops by at least one a week to buy plantains . They remind her of home in the Dominican Republic . <p> She 's puzzled by a lot of the produce in the stands , however , including a green vegetable the size of an avocado , covered with beige spines . <p> " There 's so many different things here , " Hernandez said in Spanish . " This supermarket should teach us how to eat all these things because I do n't know what they are . " <p> Ousmane " Beau " Ndoye , 36 , originally from Senegal , loaded up on frozen rabbit , shank steak , octopus , Jamaican hot peppers and a fruit he was quite happy to see : sapote . <p> " This fruit nobody has , " Ndoye said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it , too . " <p> Lee Spencer , 55 , and Hanna Park , 62 , recently drove two hours from Columbus for a midweek shopping spree at Super H-Mart . Their carts brimmed with specialty brands of Korean noodles , soups , pancake mix , white bread from the fancy store bakery , eggplant and packaged seaweed . <p> The ladies planned to make a day of it with lunch at a Korean restaurant and hairstyling appointments at a Korean beauty salon in the Park Village . <p> Asian stores in Columbus simply are n't as attractive as the Super H-Mart , Spencer said . <p> " They 're not as big as this , " she said . " Not as nice as this . Not as fresh as this . " <p> H-MART COMPANIES INC . <p> Formerly HanAhReum Asian Mart <p> * Founder , chairman and CEO : Il Yeon Kwon .
