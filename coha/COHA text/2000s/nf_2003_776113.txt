Prologue // I do n't know about you , but I 've had enough of the whole damn thing . // I 've had enough of losing elections . // I 've had enough of losing arguments . // I 've had enough of seeing Americans losing their jobs . // Heck , I 've had enough of losing my hair . // I 've had enough of calling some B-rate cowboy my commander in Chief . // I 've had enough of the broken promises , the unnecessary secrecy , and the lying to the American people . // I 've had enough of people saying government does n't work  --  when , for them , it 's working like a charm . // I 've had enough of giving millionaires like Dick Cheney and myself tax breaks and giving America 's kids a mountain of debt . // I 've had enough of being hated around the world because I 'm an American . // Oh , but my frustration is an equal-opportunity thing . // I 've had enough of Democrats rolling over and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom DeLay , and that whole gang of Keystone Kops who are running America today . // I 've had enough of seeing our ideas stolen , then bastardized , then used to beat us over the head so hard that we stop thinking straight and what should be cries of outrage become pitiful whimpers. // I 've had enough of people coming up to me on street corners , in hotel lobbies , in airports , and whining to me about how bad things are . Believe me , I know . // I 've had enough of a press too scared and pathetic to ask a follow-up question . // I 've had enough of the blowhards on cable TV , and the self-righteous anger I hear from people whose only accomplishment in life is their ability to turn the dial on an AM radio . // Tell you what , I 've had enough of having enough . // In fact , there 's only one thing in this world aside from the love of my wife and two daughters that gives me comfort right now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , you 've probably had enough , too . // Rest assured , there are a lot of people who are as fed up as you and me . And most of them want to do something about it . But here 's the problem : they 're just sitting there , taking it . Sure , maybe you throw your shoe at the TV sometimes . But that does n't accomplish anything , unless you count seeing a tread mark on Bill O'Reilly 's face as progress . // It 's time to quit stewing , steaming , and taking abuse , and start taking action . // We need to take back our country from the tax-cutting , environment-desecrating , secret-keeping , influence-peddling , warmongering , free-speech-hating , hypocritical right-wing goofballs who are running things today . // We need to say , " Enough is enough . " We want our country back , and we intend to get it back . // That 's what this book is : it 's a guide for taking back Congress , the White House , and America from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch  --  today . And we 're not just going to rant , and rave , and criticize . We 're going to put forward some fresh new ideas to make progressives stronger , and our country better . // So consider the following pages a constructive outlet for your case of political road rage , and read on . //
