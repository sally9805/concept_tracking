THE GOOD NEWS : Our challenges can be either genetic or man-made , but there are a host of new treatments and technologies designed to revitalize even the most fragile strands and restore them to a more lush condition . Here are the best strategies in the fight against hair loss .

" If women are consistently losing more than the acceptable 50 to 100 hairs a day , they should seek further medical attention , " says Monte O. Harris , M.D. , of Culture Cosmetic Medical Spa in Washington , D.C. These are five common causes of hair loss : 1 . TRACTION ALOPECIA is characterized by loss of hair primarily along the hairline , especially around the temples and above the ears . It is a result of tension caused by certain taut hairstyles-namely weaves , braids and ponytails . It is reversible when it first appears ; however , if left untreated , overtime it becomes permanent . 2 . CENTRAL CENTRIFUGAL CICATRICIAL ALOPECIA ( CCCA ) was known as hot-comb alopecia back in the day . While an exact cause has not been determined , some doctors ascribe this condition to excessive heat styling and chemical processes .

HAIR TRANSPLANT101 Best for : Those who have localized hair loss , where there are distinct , focal areas like those seen with traction alopecia and CCCA . " In these patients , single transplant sessions have the potential of providing a great aesthetic outcome , " explains Harris . In cases where the loss is more diffuse , such as in androgenetic hair loss , it Is more of a challenge to achieve adequate density without damaging surrounding follicles , Harris adds . The process : With the patient under local anesthesia , a donor strip of hair and scalp containing follicular unit grafts is taken from the back of the head and transplanted into sparse areas . There is a three-to-six-month period before new growth occurs . " Surgical hair restoration has really evolved over the past five to ten years , " says Harris , who plans to open a facility in the fall of 2007 that will specialize in hair transplantation for women of color . Pros : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to African-Americans makes for a fuller look than straighter hair . " You do n't need as many grafts to get a good amount of density , " Harris says . Cons : If the primary cause of hair loss is an autoimmune disorder such as lupus , or if there is a history of keloid scarring , then transplants are not a viable option . And postprocedure hair growth can be unreliable . " Black women are more susceptible to scarring types of hair loss , which lowers the success rate of this procedure , " explains Jeffrey Epstein , M.D. , a facial plastic surgeon with offices in Miami and New York City . " Therefore , when there is a suspicion of scarring alopecia , I recommend a smaller test procedure first to determine how successful the transplant growth will be , " he adds .
