<p> Franklin D. Raines 's annual holiday party is as much a gathering of friends as it is a testament to his status . This year 's soiree , three nights ago , drew dozens from the upper reaches of Washington 's business and political worlds to his Northwest Washington home . <p> The affair fell at the end of what was arguably the worst week of Raines 's professional life , and his uncertain future as head of Fannie Mae was one of the main topics of conversation . <p> According to a few who were there , Raines was his usual easy self , using dark humor to diffuse any discomfort among his friends as the 55-year-old chief executive faced the possibility of an inglorious finish to his astoundingly successful career . <p> " Our family is going to our place in Bermuda , " Raines told one person who asked about holiday plans . He paused and smiled . " And maybe I 'll just stay there . " <p> Raines wholly embraced his role as a celebrity CEO . Since his appointment as chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fannie Mae , its ambassador to both government and Wall Street . Almost every page on Fannie Mae 's Web site includes his picture . Since an accounting controversy broke three months ago , Raines has put his personal reputation on the line in defending the company 's practices and calling into question the motives of its detractors . For years , Raines has personally cast himself and his company as models of good corporate governance . <p> But Fannie 's federal regulator , after a year of investigation , came to a starkly different conclusion in September , releasing a report that cited serious lapses in internal accounting controls , allegedly rigged earnings and willful flouting of accounting rules . Then last week , the Securities and Exchange Commission 's chief accountant concurred in a stinging rebuke of Fannie 's and Raines 's public denials of financial logrolling . Fannie Mae 's board met Thursday and yesterday as some investors and corporate governance specialists were calling for Raines 's ouster . They have not announced a resolution . <p> Fannie 's fall from grace , though it has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fannie 's balance sheet , is a deeply personal test for Raines . <p> " It 's very painful for him , " said a close friend and business associate , who spoke on condition of anonymity because Raines and the company have asked people close to the situation not to comment to the press . " He 's a straight arrow . " <p> Raines himself declined to comment . <p> Throughout his career , Raines has woven his life story into his public image . <p> He was born in Seattle , the fourth of six children , to a family that had moved to the city from the deep South in search of a steady paycheck . His father worked as a mechanic at Boeing , his mother as a cleaning lady in the aircraft maker 's executive offices . His father suffered from depression and lost his job because of long absences . The family made ends meet with welfare checks . Raines went to work to bring in extra money when he was 8 . <p> Raines excelled in school , becoming class president in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perfect grades and was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University . His cool-headed leadership during the student uprisings at the school in 1969 caught the eye of a professor there , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the future New York senator . That summer , Moynihan invited Raines to intern in the Nixon White House , where Moynihan was a special assistant to the president . <p> From there , Raines 's career took off : Rhodes Scholar , Harvard Law School , private law practice , domestic policy adviser in the Carter Administration . In 1980 , he joined the investment bank Lazard , Freres &; Co. in New York , and became general partner in 1985 . He quit the job in 1991 to spend more time with his young children , who were living in Washington . <p> James A. Johnson , then Fannie 's chief executive , asked Raines to become Fannie 's vice chairman in 1991 . The company 's offices were a short drive from his home . In his first stint at Fannie , Raines worked mostly in the guts of the company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In 1996 , President Clinton appointed Raines director of the Office of Management and Budget . He was instrumental in Clinton 's budget battles with the Republican-controlled Congress , eventually winning bipartisan support for most of Clinton 's spending priorities and laying the groundwork for a balanced budget by 2002 . <p> Raines was not a political operator in the classic Washington sense , say those who worked with him in government . " Fairly distant , all business , " said one Clinton staffer who had weekly contact with Raines . <p> " He 's not a politico , he 's not part of that world , " Johnson told The Post in 1996 . <p> Yet he was not without considerable political skill . Raines 's job at OMB put him into close contact with many of the legislators from both parties who had a hand in overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . <p> When Johnson decided to leave Fannie Mae in 1998 , he personally lobbied his board to replace him with Raines , who became chief executive in January 1999 . He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune 500 company . <p> In his tenure , Raines 's primary tasks have been managing the risks associated with the mortgage finance market , as well as political challenges to Fannie 's government-sponsored status . <p> As a business , Fannie Mae has thrived under Raines . Its revenue grew an average of 11.5 percent a year from 1999 to 2003 , its reported net income 22 percent , although the results for those years are likely to be restated . Stockholders during Raines 's tenure have fared less well : Fannie 's stock , at Friday 's close of $70.31 , trades slightly below its price on the day Raines took the top job . Fannie pays a regular dividend , but its shares are volatile for the stock of such a large company , trading as high as $87 a share in 2001 and as low as $46 in 2000 . <p> Raines is among the highest-paid chief executives in the financial services sector . In 2003 , he took in more than $16.8 million in cash compensation ( salary , bonus and long-term incentive payouts ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10.9 million in 2001 . He has also received options to purchase more than 700,000 shares from 2001 to 2003 . <p> Raines has managed Fannie 's political risk vigorously , deploying campaign contributions , a potent force of lobbyists and allies among homeownership groups , and his personal charm in the service of protecting Fannie Mae 's government-sponsored status , which lowers its borrowing costs relative to purely private companies and exempts it from most local taxation . <p> But it was Fannie 's accounting , not its many critics , that has proven the enemy . When publicly confronting the accounting controversy , at an Oct. 6 hearing of the House Financial Services subcommittee overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Raines mustered all his talent to counter the allegations , carefully arguing that the accounting rules in question " are highly complex and require determinations over which experts often disagree . " <p> But he began his testimony not with these arguments , but with himself . These charges , he seemed to be saying , were personal . <p> " My name is Frank Raines . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in Seattle , went to public school , graduated from college and law school . I 'm a brother , a husband , a father and friend . . . . I introduce myself in this way not because I 'm a stranger to this committee , but because I do not recognize the person , colleagues or company that someone described this morning . "
