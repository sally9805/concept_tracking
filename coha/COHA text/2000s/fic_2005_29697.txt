Chapter One Agnes Torres parked her white Ford Escort in the little parking area outside the hedge and stepped into the cool dawn air . The hedges were twelve feet high and as impenetrable as a brick wall ; only the shingled peak of the big house could be seen from the street . But she could hear the surf thundering and smell the salt air of the invisible ocean beyond . Agnes carefully locked the car-it paid to be careful , even in this neighborhood-and , fumbling with the massive set of keys , found the right one and stuck it into the lock . The heavy sheet-metal gate swung inward , exposing a broad expanse of green lawn that swept three hundred yards down to the beach , flanked by two dunes . A red light on a keypad just inside the gate began blinking , and she entered the code with nervous fingers . She had thirty seconds before the sirens went off . Once , she had dropped her keys and could n't punch in the code in time , and the thing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Jeremy had been so angry she thought he would breathe fire . It had been awful . Agnes punched the last button and the light turned green . She breathed a sigh of relief , locked the gate , and paused to cross herself . Then she drew out her rosary , held the first beadreverently between her fingers . Fully armed now , she turned and began waddling across the lawn on short , thick legs , walking slowly to allow herself time to intone the Our Fathers , the Hail Marys , and the Glory Bes in quiet Spanish . She always said a decade on her rosary when entering the Grove Estate . The vast gray house loomed in front of her , a single eyebrow window in the roof peak frowning like the eye of a Cyclops , yellow against the steel gray of the house and sky . Seagulls circled above , crying restlessly . Agnes was surprised . She never remembered that light on before . What was Mr. Jeremy doing in the attic at seven o'clock in the morning ? Normally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her prayers , she replaced the rosary and crossed herself again : a swift , automatic gesture , made with a rough hand that had seen decades of domestic work . She hoped Mr. Jeremy was n't still awake . She liked to work in an empty house , and when he was up , everything was so unpleasant : the cigarette ashes he dropped just behind her mop , the dishes he heaped in the sink just after she had washed , the comments and the endless swearing to himself , into the phone or at the newspaper , always followed by a harsh laugh . His voice was like a rusty knife-it cut and slashed the air . He was thin and mean and stank of cigarettes and drank brandy at lunch and entertained sodomites at all hours of the day and night . Once he had tried to speak Spanish with her but she had quickly put an end to that . Nobody spoke Spanish to her except family and friends , and Agnes Torres spoke English perfectly well enough . On the other hand , Agnes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy was very correct with her employment . He paid her well , always on time , he never asked her to stay late , never changed her schedule , and never accused her of stealing . Once , early on , he had blasphemed against the Lord in her presence , and she had spoken to him about it , and he had apologized quite civilly and had never done it again . She came up the curving flagstone path to the back door , inserted a second key , and once again fumbled nervously with the keypad , turning off the internal alarm . The house was gloomy and gray , the mullioned windows in front looking out on a long seaweed-strewn beach to an angry ocean . The sound of the surf was muffled here and the house was hot . Unusually hot . She sniffed . There was a strange smell in the air , like a greasy roast left too long in the oven . She waddled into the kitchen but it was empty . The dishes were heaped up , and the place was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell was n't coming from here . It looked like Mr. Jeremy had cooked fish the night before . She did n't usually clean his house on Tuesdays , but he 'd had one of his countless dinner parties the prior evening . Labor Day had come and gone a month before , but Mr. Jeremy 's weekend parties would n't end until November . She went into the living room and sniffed the air again . Something was definitely cooking somewhere . And there was another smell on top of it , as if somebody had been playing with matches . Agnes Torres felt a vague sense of alarm . Everything was more or less as she had left it when she went away yesterday , at two in the afternoon , except that the ashtrays were overflowing with butts and the usual empty wine bottles stood on the sideboard , dirty dishes were piled in the sink , and someone had dropped soft cheese on the rug and stepped in it . She raised her plump face and sniffed again . The smell came from above . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused to sniff at the landing . She tiptoed past Grove 's study , past his bedroom door , continued down the hall , turned the dogleg , and came to the door to the third floor . The smell was stronger here and the air was heavier , warmer . She tried to open the door but found it locked . She took out her bunch of keys , clinked through them , and unlocked the door . Madre de Dios-the smell was much worse . She mounted the steep unfinished stairs , one , two , three , resting her arthritic legs for a moment on each tread . She rested again at the top , breathing heavily . The attic was vast , with one long hall off which were half a dozen unused children 's bedrooms , a playroom , several bathrooms , and an unfinished attic space jammed with furniture and boxes and horrible modern paintings . At the far end of the hall , she saw a bar of yellow light under the door to the last bedroom . She took a few tentative steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hammering , but with her hand clutching the rosary she knew she was safe . As she approached the door , the smell grew steadily worse . She tapped lightly on it , just in case some guest of Mr. Jeremy was sleeping in there , hungover or sick . But there was no response . She grasped the doorknob and was surprised to find it slightly warm to the touch . Was there a fire ? Had somebody fallen asleep , cigarette in hand ? There was definitely a faint smell of smoke , but it was n't just smoke somehow : it was something stronger . Something foul . She tried the doorknob , found it locked . It reminded her of the time , when she was a little girl at the convent school , when crazy old Sister Ana had died and they had to force open her door . Somebody on the other side might need her assistance ; might be sick or incapacitated . Once again she fumbled with the keys . She had no idea which one went to the door , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key turned . Holding her breath , she opened the door , but it moved only an inch before stopping , blocked by something . She pushed , pushed harder , heard a crash on the other side . Santa Maria , it was going to wake up Mr. Jeremy . She waited , but there was no sound of his tread , no slamming bathroom door or flushing toilet , none of the sounds that signaled his irascible rising . She pushed at the door and was able to get her head inside , holding her breath against the smell . A thin screen of haze drifted in the room , and it was as hot as an oven . The room had been shut up for years-Mr . Jeremy despised children-and dirty spiderwebs hung from the peeling beadboard walls . The crash had been caused by the toppling of an old armoire that had been pushed up against the door . In fact , all the furniture in the room seemed to have been piled against the door , except for the bed . The bed , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Jeremy lay on it , fully clothed . " Mr. Jeremy ? " But Agnes Torres knew there would be no answer . Mr. Jeremy was n't sleeping , not with his charred eyes burned permanently open , the ashy cone of his mouth frozen in a scream and his blackened tongue-swelled to the size of a chorizo sausage-sticking straight up from it like a flagpole . A sleeping man would n't be lying with his elbows raised above the bed , fists clenched so hard that blood had leaked between the fingers . A sleeping man would n't have his torso scorched and caved in upon itself like a burned log . She had seen many dead people during her childhood in Colombia , and Mr. Jeremy looked deader than any of them . He was as dead as they come . She heard someone speaking and realized it was herself , murmuring En el nombre del Padre , y del Hijo , y del Espiritu Santo ... She crossed herself yet again , fumbling out her rosary , unable to move her feet or take her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorched mark on the floor , right at the foot of the bed : a mark which Agnes recognized . In that moment , she understood exactly what had happened to Mr. Jeremy Grove . A muffled cry escaped her throat and she suddenly had the energy to back out of the room and shut the door . She fumbled with the keys and relocked it , all the while murmuring Creo en Dios , Padre todopoderoso , creador del cielo y de la tierra . She crossed herself again and again and again , clutching the rosary and holding it up to her chest as she backed down the hall , step by step , sobs mingling with her mumbled prayers . The cloven hoofprint burned into the floor told her everything she needed to know . The devil had finally come for Jeremy Grove . ( Continues ... )
