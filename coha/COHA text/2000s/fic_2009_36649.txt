HE 'D CHAIN-SMOKE HER IF HE COULD <p> <p> Tauris Diggs sat in the back of the room , cloaked in darkness , sipping on gin and tonic , taking her in an inch at a time . Rayne was built like rhythms , with flowing lines curving into hips , thighs , and ass . She did n't have much on top , but it did n't matter . Tauris glanced around the room wondering if anyone in that audience could see his fingerprintson her skin . Could they see the impression his lips had left on hers ? No . And it was all well and good , too , because these people were n't grown enough to bear witness to the kind of shit he and Rayne did in private . <p> Sweet comic valentine <p> You make me smile with my heart <p> Addictions were dangerous . Addictions to a woman like Rayne Fitzgerald were lethal and he figured out months ago that he was a lost cause beyond salvation , destined to go belly up at her feet when the time came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with sometimes , but that bad-ass attitude of hers just seemed too much like right paired with the rest of her . She was a walking , talking , blues ballad . The kind that made you cry and left you wanting more just so you could cry again . Tauris was a fool over her , and she knew it . And that was the worst part . <p> Your lips are laughable <p> Unphotographable <p> She was breathtaking in white . White against her blue-black skin looked sacred and mystic . Rayne worked the hell out of it , too , swaying her hips slowly back and forth , as the light bounced off each and every sequin on that gown , hypnotizing and lulling people into the spell that was her . Rayne 's long locks were piled high on her head like a crown , and full , moist lips circled every syllable that came from her mouth . <p> " People want magic when you get up on that stage , " she 'd explained to him . " They listen for it and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul coming up from your gut and out of your mouth  --  throw in some booze and the whole scene unfolds like a dream right in front of their eyes , " she winked and smiled . " That 's what I do for a living , baby . I make dreams come true . " <p> She sure was making his come true when she was n't treating him like a reject . Hot one minute , cold the next , Rayne dismissed him when she was through , then snapped her fingers and whistled when she needed him . Tauris swore he was n't going to keep putting up with her , but of course he did . And he would keep on until she decided to stop snapping flngers and whistling for him . They both knew that . <p> He would n't have taken that kind of behavior from any other woman , but then , Rayne was n't just any woman . Standing back watching the crowd , he caught more than one man salivating at the sight of her . Hell , even a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal . <p> " I want you to wait for me after the show , " she 'd told him earlier . Rayne 's gritty and worn voice was deep and Southern , even when she was n't singing , and it comforted him and seduced him , drawing him in like a lullaby . <p> He did n't respond , thinking he could outplay her in this game between them where she made up the rules as she went along . Play it hard , man , he told himself . Do n't be a punk and give in so easily . Make her sweat . Tell her you 've got something to do . <p> She seemed to sense this small internal war he waged inside himself , and she turned from her reflection in the mirror , walked over to where he stood , and ran her finger lightly across his lower lip , then kissed the corner of his mouth . " Come on , Tauris , " she whispered . Rayne took his lip between her teeth , and bit down slightly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na make me beg for it ? " <p> Women like her were a luxury . The best most men could ever do was to jack off to the fantasy of her . Rayne was that rare exotic jewel that few would ever get to put their hands on , and here she was , practically begging for him . He did n't need to bother saying yes . She saw his answer in his eyes and felt it in his pants . Rayne laughed mockingly , patted his cheek , and left him sitting in her dressing room . <p> " This next little number is dedicated to a good friend of mine , " she spoke to the crowd , and then winked in his direction . " It 's off my last CD , a song written by Joel Lewis and Tammy Jacobs , and it 's called , Too Much Woman for You . ' " <p> The audience howled and clapped . Tauris shifted uneasily in his seat . <p> " But do n't worry , baby , " she smiled at him , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on her radar . " I promise to take it easy on you . " <p> Everyone in the room laughed . Rayne laughed the loudest . Tauris did n't laugh at all . He just took another sip from his glass , and tried not to look offended . <p> Excerpted from THAT 'S DEVIL 'S NO FRIEND OF MINE by J.D.MASON <p> Copyright 2009 by J.D.Mason <p> Published in 2009 by St.Martin
