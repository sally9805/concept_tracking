I had two routine checkups last week , and both the eye doctor and the dentist asked me to update my health history for their records . Their requests made sense . Health-care providers should know what problems their patients have had and what medications they 're taking to be on the lookout for potential trouble or complications . <P> On each history , however , the section labeled FAMILY HEALTH HISTORY gave me pause . Few diseases are purely genetic , but plenty have genetic components . If my father suffered from elevated LDL , or bad cholesterol , my doctor should know that , because I 'm probably at higher risk . If my mother had breast cancer , my sister ( if I had one ) would want her physician to be especially vigilant . <P> While I know something about the history of my parents ' health  --  my father had prostate cancer at a relatively young age and suffered from macular degeneration and Parkinson 's disease , and my mother died of lung cancer  --  there 's plenty I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I assume I would have known if either suffered from diabetes , but I ca n't swear to that . And when it comes to my grandparents , whose genes I also have , I 'm even more in the dark . <P> That makes me fairly typical . According to Dr. Richard Carmona , the U.S. Surgeon General , only about a third of Americans have even tried to put together a family-health history . That 's why he has launched the Family History Initiative and declared Thanksgiving National Family History Day . Sitting around the turkey talking about cancer and heart disease may seem like a grim thing to do when you 're supposed to be giving thanks for everything that 's going right . But since many families will be gathering for the holiday anyway , it 's a perfect time to create a medical family tree . <P> And the Surgeon General is making it easy : if you go to
