THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK Headnote Negative population growth by the end of the twenty-firstcentury could mean less demand on resources and more food for everyone . Photograph // In October 1999 , the earth 's population surpassed 6 billion people , a milestone greeted by doomsayers with expressions of gloom . Supporting this gloom is the declining growth rate in crop yields . Though supply and demand are now growing at almost the same rate , there are still fears that food demand will eventually outpace food supply . Growing evidence shows , however , that when negative population growthpredicted by the end of the twenty-first century-as well as environmental and other factors are taken into account , we can avoida threatened global food crisis . Society 's Four Transitional Stages Economists often refer to four transitions or stages of societies based on demographics , economics , agricultural productivity , and technological advancements . The first stage is a traditional society , characterized by low population density and low economic and population growth . In this society , which may be a country or a region , high birthrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low income and low living standards . The second stage is a developing stage , occurring when a society 's technological advancements result in sustainable agricultural production and plant and animal domestication . The result is a more plentiful food supply , which helps increase population growth mainly by slowing death rates . When population and food production growth are combined with industrialization and urbanization at this stage , the result is environmental exploitation and degradation present in many developing societies . // Stages in Economic and Demographic Transitions // Increases in agricultural productivity and production bring economic surpluses that allow growth in capital and per capita income ; the third stage , the developed society , is born . Birthrates fall faster than death rates as the roles of women change and developments in birth-control methods allow adults to choose the number of children they want . Finally , stage four , the mature society , sees notable technological change evolve beyond agriculture ( particularly in medicine and public health ) , making death rates decline further . While many technological breakthroughs in developing societies come from innovative laypersons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained , experienced , and costly technicians and scientists . By the time the mature society develops , the most readily accessible raw materials have been exploited . Obsolescence of current technology requires investment in maintenance rather than in new technologies . Increase in productivity of service activities , which grow in importance , becomes more difficult than increases in agricultural and manufacturing productivity . Some developed regions choose to sacrifice some economic growth for equity . Thus , while productivity and income continue to rise , the rate of these increases slows . Rapid agricultural productivity gains continue in developed societies as investments in education and science made in the development stage produce long-term payoffs and as urbanization and industrialization lead to an exodus of agricultural labor . At the same time , slowing rates of income growth and population growth also slow down the growth in demand for food . Food selfsufficiency increases in some countries after falling in the development stage . However , agricultural trade typically grows as more affluent consumers demand a variety of foods from around the world . Many developed countries have recently entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society of the world 's inhabitants . The long-held view is that global population growth will more or less stabilize ; recent evidence , however , presents a strong case for negative global population growth as the seminal attribute of the mature society . Evidence for Negative Population Growth According to the United Nations , the total fertility rate-the number of children a woman may be expected to bear during her lifetime-has fallen in every region of the world since 1950 . From an average of nearly six children per woman in the 1950s , by the early to mid-1990s total fertility rate fell to three children in Latin America , 3.4 in India , and 3.5 in other parts of Asia . The only major exception to this sustained downtrend is in North America , where the recent increase in total fertility rate appears to be a transitory phenomenon associated with immigration and a large number of baby-boom women deciding to have children relatively late in their lives .

As societies develop , birthrates tend to decline and agricultural productivity increases . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that , from 1990 to 1995 , these rates in Europe , China , and North America were below the 2.1 average children per woman needed to sustain population worldwide over the long run . The United Nations ' medium population projection of 2.1 children after 2040 is widely used as a demographic forecast , but it unrealistically assumes that this rate will be the same in both developed and developing countries . Many researchers , such as Wolfgang Lutz of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis , do not support the UN assertion that fertility would increase to replacement level in developed countries . Lutz and others cite evidence pointing toward low fertility , noting contraception , declining marriage rates , high divorce rates , increasing independence and career orientation of women , materialism , and consumerism . " These factors , together with increasing demands and personal expectations for attention , time , and also money to be given to children , are likely to result in fewer couples having more than one or two children and an increasing number of childless women , " Lutz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Earthscan , 1996 ) . The United Nations has a second scenario-the low/medium scenariothat presumes fertility averaging 1.9 children per woman for all regions by 2025 . This scenario may be as unrealistic as the medium population scenario . The low/medium scenario may underestimate future total fertility rates in developing countries , just as the UN medium scenario may overestimate future total fertility rate in developed countries . The low/medium scenario projects a peak world population of 7.9 billion people in 2050 , declining to 6.4 billion by 2150 . The medium scenario projects a peak world population of just less than 11 billion by approximately 2200 . Most other projections , however , predict peak global population in less than a century , followed by negative population growth . These 1998 UN population figures were revised in 2000 , and the new estimates , though tentative , indicate population trends even lower than the 1998 predictions . The low/ medium scenario is comparable to what the United Nations now calls the low variant for worldwide populations . Given the low variant , the United Nations predicts that world population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.9 billion projected under the low/medium scenario . We predict that the United Nations will continue to revise population trends downward and that negative population growth will occur even sooner than by 2150 . However , because the 2000 population data remain tentative and do not extend to 2150 , we prefer to continue to use the 1998 data for the remainder of this article . Future Food Supply/Demand Balance World food production increased 2.3% annually from 1961 to 1999 ( see graph ) . Moreover , growth in world food production outpaced growth in population . As a result , average per capita food production increased by 0.5% annually while real food prices declined by 1.8% annually . These trends mask changes over time in the contribution of yield and area . From 1961 to 1970 , global food yield rose while cropland area stayed constant . From 1970 to 1990 , both yield and cropland area rose . Since 1990 , cropland area has stayed nearly static while yield continues to increase . Millions of cropland hectares added in Brazil and other countries during the 1990s were offset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as by the conversion of cropland to urban and other noncrop uses around the globe . The finding that world food output during the 1990s depended on increased yields is important because food demand has been increasing as fast as yields since 1961 . Growth in food demand takes into account not only growth in population but also growth in per capita consumption as incomes rise . A world of no increase in acreage and similar increases in food demand and yield raises the potential of ominous outcomes . The " Alternative Scenarios for Global Food Supply and Demand " graph shows alternative food demand projections from 2000 to 2150 as well as projected food supply based on a continuation of 1961-1999 yield trends with no increase in crop area . If population and income continue to grow at the same rate as they grew from 1995 to 2000 , the demand for food will sharply outgrow future food supply . Real commodity prices would need to rise to draw additional land and other resources into food production and to restrain consumption . If the population grows at 2.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food demand growth will outstrip food supply growth , but only until approximately 2075 . This gap could probably be covered by small increases in real prices . If population growth follows the UN low/medium population scenario ( 1.9 children per woman ) , food supply will grow faster than food demand . This outcome would allow real farm commodity prices to continue to fall . It follows that the trend toward negative population growth may only narrowly avert rising real farm commodity prices in the first half of the twenty-first century . Protecting the Environment Natural-resource depletion and environmental degradation could confound the foregoing food supply and demand projections . Few activities devastate the environment more than dense populations of poor , hungry peasants clearing and cultivating rain forests and other biodiverse lands for food . Environmental degradation is minimal in the traditional society but increases in developing societies as population and economic growth accelerate . Sustained population growth leads to land clearing and soil erosion that accompany food production expansion . Although economic growth occurs , developing countries do not possess the financial resources to pay for costly pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without taking into account future considerations , further discouraging investment in environmental protection . Streams become polluted and air quality deteriorates , two of the more obvious manifestations of wideranging environmental degradation as a society moves from developing to developed . // Alternative Scenarios for Global Food Supply and Demand This graph shows world food yield increasing at the rate of 2.3% annually . If world population continues to grow at the same rate that it did in 1995-2000 ( 1.4% annually ) , the demand for food will totally outpace the food supply . Under the UN low/medium scenario , which predicts 1.9 children per woman worldwide by 2025 , the percentage of demand for food is far less than predicted food yield trends . Under the UN medium scenario , which predicts 2.1 children per woman , there will be more demand than supply through about 2075 . ( This graph shows percentage rate of growth compared to 2000 , not actual numbers of people or amounts of food. ) // Several studies have shown that the interaction between population and income will ultimately save the environment while leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising affluence is attended by effective policies to establish appropriate environmental care incentives and institutions . First , higher income in part brings about lower population growth , which reduces pressure on the environment . Second , as incomes rise , consumers spend a larger share on services , production and disposal of which are generally less detrimental to the environment than other forms of consumption . Higher-income consumers also demand greater efforts to protect the environment because , once their basic needs are met , they become more concerned about environmental quality and have the income to do something about it . Education and research made possible by economic progress also promote awareness of the environment , which in turn can generate effective policy responses . The net result is increasingly less environmental damage , followed by environmental preservation . Higher income also means that current earnings are no longer needed solely to provide necessities and can be used to finance investment in science and technology . Higher per capita income and slower population growth contribute to lowering harmful emissions into the environment and reducing the use of natural resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research enable farmers to cultivate fewer acres , freeing arable land for grass , trees , recreation , and biodiversity . Ultimately , though we will use less acreage for crops , we will have more green , environmentally friendly space . And because food yield per acre has increased , there will still be enough food production . The Challenges Ahead Interacting demographic , economic , and environmental transitions produce mostly positive outcomes . Of course , making predictions with absolute certainty is a dangerous undertaking ; unforeseen factors can intervene-and probably will . What follows are other considerations that further affect or accompany food supply and demand issues . The United Nations ' low/medium population projection suggests that food supply growth will continue to outpace food demand growth , resulting in continuing decline in real prices for farmers . Falling fertility rates will avert a global food crisis . However , the optimistic projection of the food supply and demand balance should not be a basis for complacency ; commitment to public and private investments in food science and technology will be essential to avoid future real price increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nepal . World food supply should outpace demand as a result of lower birthrates , slower death rates , and falling farm commodity prices making food cheaper and more readily available . // The declining real price of farm commodities will spur development of new nonfood uses , including energy , plastics , and pharmaceuticals . It is conceivable that these uses will exceed food uses in the not-toodistant future . Nonfood uses will make for a more price-elastic demand , thereby diminishing perennial problems of price instability in agriculture ; that is , farm commodity prices will become less volatile . Trade must also be taken into account . From little or no international trade in the traditional society , agricultural and general trade increases in developing societies and remains high once a society is developed and higher incomes and population growth encourage food imports . While demand growth will fall with negative population growth , thus slowing trade in mature cultures . However , food businesses will still drive trade among nations to achieve economies of size and meet specialized needs . Furthermore , for food products , consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations than on prices . Thus , agricultural trade in a mature society remains high to supply the diversity of food products demanded by high-income consumers . Photograph A family sits down to a wholesome meal . Given current economic and demographic factors , studies predict peak world population by 2050 ; there should be enough food for everyone in the twenty-first century . // Africa 's population will continue to increase , even under the United Nations ' low/medium scenario , approaching 2 billion people in 150 years . Local food production is not expected to keep pace with growth in food demand . By 2020 , cereal imports by sub-Saharan Africa could be triple the 1990 level . Building buying power within Africa to purchase needed food imports will be challenging indeed . The low-input , sustainable agriculture of the traditional society contrasts sharply with environmental deterioration at an initially low but increasing rate in developing societies , and at a high though decreasing rate in developed societies . In a mature society , however , the accumulation of wealth , science , technology , and knowledge coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degradation . Thus , mature societies provide optimism for the environment . The environmental dilemma is how and whether developing countries , including China and India , can pass through the developing and developed stages of high environmental degradation and natural-resource depletion to the higher per capita income of their maturity-when environmental preservation predominates - without irreversibly damaging the global environment in the process . Assuming appropriate policy is followed , falling world population plus economic development will allow this transition to occur . International migration involving both high- and low-skilled workers will become pervasive . Farms in North America and Europe will continue to seek immigrant labor to perform labor-intensive jobs . Migration will lead to greater cultural diversity within nations and could cause a narrowing of cultural gaps . The potential for cultural and ethnic strife will be real , however , and could negatively affect food production and trade . The exodus of labor from agriculture will continue . Negative population growth will lower labor supply and raise the relative cost of labor , as well as of management and entrepreneurship . Technological change will replace labor and human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with computer intelligence and robotics . Ethical questions accompany many of these issues , especially in countries with negative population growth : How far should machines be allowed to replace workers ? How far should genetic engineering be allowed to alter plants and animals ? While these questions will energize policy debates across all segments of society , agriculture 's place as a producer of food and the strong emotions that it engenders as a way of life suggest that this debate will be especially energetic when it involves appropriate policies for agriculture .

High incidence of AIDS in parts of Africa complicates making population projections for this continent . J. Bongaarts in his essay " Global Trends in AIDS Mortality " projects that AIDS will reduce the population growth rate in sub-Saharan Africa to 2.6% per year by 2005 , compared with 2.8% per year without AIDS in the same region . The impact would be even greater except that many adults bear children before succumbing to AIDS . Nonetheless , Africa 's population growth rate could fall further than anticipated unless the AIDS epidemic is brought under control . - Luther Tweeten and Carl Zulauf Sidebar Genetically Modified Crops Sidebar * Estimated global area of genetically modified ( GM ) crops is 13o million acres ( 52.6 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Principal GM crops : Soybeans : 83 million acres ( 63% of global GM crop area ) .
