<p> BEIJING  --  Another night online in Beijing : In a chat room run by the People 's Daily newspaper  --  the mouthpiece of China 's ruling Communist Party  --  Chinese Internet users are expressing some decidedly unofficial opinions . <p> Three users banter about Taiwan 's upcoming election and express grudging respect for a candidate the Chinese government loathes . Another makes an impassioned cry for freedom of speech in a nation where voicing unauthorized opinions can mean a prison term . Still another posts a poem that pokes fun at the " cleaning ladies "  --  censors who come online to scrub away comments that go too far in criticizing the government . <p> The cleaning ladies have their hands full these days . <p> The Internet is exploding in China and threatens to overwhelm the government 's ability to control it . China 's online population more than quadrupled last year to almost 9 million . Within five years , the world 's most populous country is expected to have more Internet users than any other country . <p> The Internet boom has created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be wired to the Net if it is going to thrive in the 21st century economy , and they are investing millions in Internet start-ups to get the process moving . <p> But the government also wants to keep tight controls on information people can see and on the things they can say in public . So it is hustling to monitor Net content with the same fervor as it does print and broadcast media . It is putting laws in place to allow it to crack down on those who push too far , sending strong messages to many by making examples of a few : <p> * Last year , a Chinese e-mail service used by some members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement was shut down for 48 hours . The group used the Internet to rapidly mobilize . <p> * Also last year , it sentenced Shanghai software entrepreneur Lin Hai to two years in prison on a charge of " inciting to overthrow the government " for allegedly selling e-mail addresses of Internet users in China to a U.S.-based dissident publication . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet cafes in Shanghai were closed because they did n't have government licenses and , according to the Shanghai News , avoided paying taxes and disseminated " pornographic CDs , which corrupt the minds of young people . " <p> " The majority of powerful lawmakers realize the Internet should be nurtured , not killed , " says David Wolf , director of Claydon Gescher Associates , a Beijing business consulting group . " The trend has been toward a . . . more open Internet . But the people who push too far are going to set themselves up as an example of what not to do . " <p> Pressuring providers <p> Most recently , China has tightened rules for Internet content providers . In January , it banned release of " state secrets " on the Net  --  a label that can cover anything not specifically government approved for publication  --  and told providers to monitor chat rooms , electronic bulletin boards and news groups . <p> To let something objectionable stand is to run the risk of being shut down , for hours or days , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the heads of start-ups . " If it is too explosive , we 'll find it and delete it , " says Charles Zhang , CEO of SOHU.com . <p> The government also is threatening to rein in freelance writers who supply content to Chinese sites , most often in sports and music . In China , all media are supposed to be sanctioned by the government , and freelancers operate outside the bounds . <p> What China threatens and what it does , however , can differ . And so many government agencies are vying for control over the Internet  --  and its economic benefits  --  that a ruling by one agency can be changed by another . <p> The government 's inexperience with Net technology also may sometimes lead to poor judgment . Last week , it eased tough restrictions on the use of encryption technology just months after issuing them . Encryption in software is used to protect data , such as credit card numbers being sent over the Net , from hackers . The onerous rules were heavily criticized by software makers and users . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules do n't really change what they 're doing . For the most part , they already shy away from potentially objectionable foreign news in favor of safe subjects , such as locally approved news , entertainment and matchmaking . <p> But visitors exchanging information and opinions in chat rooms often say things online that would have been unthinkable a few years ago . Much of the information about a huge corruption investigation in the southern city of Xiamen , for instance , first emerged online . China 's newspapers have said almost nothing about the scandal . <p> " Sometimes you can criticize the Chinese leaders , even call them names , " says Wang Xiaodong , a Beijing researcher who has written one book about the Net and is working on another . <p> The government even has created a forum for political discourse : the People 's Daily chat room , called " Strengthen the Country . " <p> " In the information age , if you do n't offer people such a service , they will go somewhere else , " Wang says . The People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government ) can learn about public opinion . " <p> Chat room visitors argue about whether China needs democracy , whether China is getting bullied by the United States and whether Mao Zedong 's Cultural Revolution was a destructive travesty ( frequently the view of those who lived through it ) or an idealistic attempt to purify Chinese society ( so say many younger users ) . <p> China 's Net users often express virulent nationalism , never more so than after the United States accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last May . <p> In fact , some political reformers worry that the Internet promotes mindless jingoism instead of thoughtful debate . <p> Benign uses <p> For the most part , though , China 's Internet users care more about e-mail and access to information than they do about political discourse . Internet user Maria Li , owner of a Beijing firm that supplies interior decorations to hotels , figures 85% of her time online is spent working . Most of the rest is exchanging e-mail with friends and checking the news . Li particularly savors the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates getting hit in the face by a pie . <p> At RenRen.com , a Hong Kong-based online community site targeting Chinese , employees dubbed " community architects " monitor chat rooms and , most often , spend their time keeping the conversation going , says CEO Michael Robinson . Not once in nine months have the employees had to remove politically sensitive chat . <p> The government is vague about what 's objectionable . Pornography is an obvious no-no , though you can find it on Chinese sites , sometimes in the guise of information about " health " or " beauty . " <p> General complaining about government is allowed , but specific criticism by name of any party official is usually not , says Gong Yu Guo , general manager of Internet portal ChinaByte . <p> Some Net companies use software to identify when a leader 's name appears in online postings so they can remove any derogatory comments . But writer Wang Xiaodong says chat-room visitors dodge that restriction by putting a space between characters or using nicknames . <p> No portal has the people-power to monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're assigning employees to serve as liaisons with government officials . That way , they 're likely to be warned to remove something before the government takes action to shut down their site . <p> Control attempts <p> Since 1996 , China has intermittently blocked Internet access to many foreign sites , including news sites such as CNN , and sites sympathetic to Chinese dissidents , Taiwan and Tibet independence , Tiananmen Square and pro-democracy activists . Stanford University 's site was blocked because it ran an article written by a Chinese dissident . <p> In 1996 , the government banned any Internet content considered to be " socially destabilizing " or otherwise " objectionable in nature . " <p> Also that year , the government demanded that every Internet user register with police  --  an onerous requirement that fell flat as Internet growth exploded . In 1997 , China was still serious about cutting its Internet off from the rest of the world with a China-only intranet . <p> None of those attempts did the job ; thus the reliance on self-censorship . <p> " If CNN is blocked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet analyst with market research firm BDA China . " It is hard to close the door on information . " <p> Net power struggle <p> The battle between China and its people over the Internet : <p> * The control . When China 's Internet users attempt to access a foreign site , they type the address into their browser . The computer sends the request , usually by regular telephone line , to China 's International Connection Bureau ( ICB ) , a set of computers operated by state-owned China Telecom . Software at that level is programmed to reject requests to banned sites . China blocks sites only if a large enough number of users access them . This can be done only intermittently because the software does n't have enough computing power to block every objectionable site all the time . By blocking a site intermittently , the government hopes users will simply assume the site is n't accessible . <p> * The roundabout . China Internet users typically start by logging onto a " proxy " site , set up to do nothing but route Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . A costly option is to have an account with a foreign Internet service provider . Then the computer 's sign-on call to ICB is seen as a phone call , not a request to go to a Web site . Once hooked into the foreign ISP , the user can go anywhere on the Internet . But this requires the user to make a long-distance call and is rarely used . Getting around banned sites can be done by going to megasites set up by anonymous hosts outside of China . At a megasite , a user can link to any of the banned sites . Once government censors spot and ban a megasite , operators set up another , using e-mail to give users the new address . <p> TEXT WITHIN GRAPHICS BEGINS HERE <p> Number of Internet users in China ' 9515,000 ' 96120,000 ' 97900,000 ' 982.1 million ' 998.9 million <p> Who 's surfing in China <p> Three-quarters of Internet users in China are between the ages of 18-30 and 91% have monthly incomes of less than $ 483 .
