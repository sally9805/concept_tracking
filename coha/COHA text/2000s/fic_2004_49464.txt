Mucking around in the slimy , extinct creek bed was dirty heaven for most of the second-grade boys and girls , who immediately armed themselves with gooey objects to slide down necks of each other 's T-shirts-all except fastidious little Lily Fusco . Of course , this was why she discovered the body . <p> The girl had moved away from her mud-loving classmates to search the banks in peace , and something smooth and shiny caught her eye . She was doing as she 'd been told ; she filled a blue bucket with some murky water from a sinkhole and plodded across pudding-thick mud in her rain boots . In a long , slow curve of the once-filled streambed , she poured , to clear the silt from what was surely a treasure lodged against a tree root : old clamshell , a rock teeming with trilobites . <p> Years before , Mrs. Sundquist 's classes had gone there to find live things . Now the creek was almost completely dry ; the housing development upstream had seen to that over a decade ago . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those as old as Mrs. Sundquist , over thirty , recalled the flow : barely hip-deep , just enough current to brighten the stony shingle below , which had hidden salamanders under flat slabs of limestone , formed a nursery for little crayfish . Now , the bed held only runoff , and lanky box elder , alder , and cottonwood seedlings stretched from the mud . Her students these days went to glean fossils from stacked sedimentary ledges protruding from clay-rich soil in the banks , to pull artifacts of fluvial life from amid tree roots and marsh marigolds . <p> Lily , finding an object with promise , rubbed with the long-handled brush she 'd been given . She scrubbed , gently ; trickled water , scrubbed and trickled , and a furrowed shape began to emerge from the root , around the bright spot , mother-of-pearl . Lily shrieked with pitch so achingly high and true that even the boys stopped their gloppy horseplay and turned around . <p> The teacher , seeing it was Lily and that she was upright and perfectly intact , glanced over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> Lily had dropped her pail and was broadcasting intermittent signals , high and clear like the shrieking whistle at the sheet-metal plant . Lily , Lily , intoned Mrs. Sundquist soothingly , edging her way across slick rock and mud . Calm down . Did those boys scare you ? <p> But Lily wriggled no creepy-crawlies from her T-shirt ; she stood still , pointing , stabbing a finger down at the creek bed . The teacher stooped , peered . It was a pale greenish fingernail . <p> Lily , come here , honey , said Mrs. Sundquist , very quietly . My , that root looks kind of like a finger , does n't it ? No wonder you were scared . <p> She could n't resist giving the thing one more little swish with the girl 's brush ; a hand , all right . She bent towards the girl and put a finger to her lips . Let 's not scare the others , shall we ? she whispered , and the little girl nodded , lip trembling , her brown braids bobbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other second-graders scurrying about , and when they did n't come , said : Counting ! One , two , three , four ... and boys and girls scrambled over the banks and crept from under trees and converged together . I think it 's getting kind of hot today , she said cheerily . Anybody for ice cream ? <p> Whoops and chirps , clatter to collect buckets and rocks , a great rush toward the minibus , because usually when she counted it meant trouble , and never , never ice cream . <p> As she herded them toward the bus , the teacher cast a look back over her shoulder and fought a shudder . <p> The cops and the coroners spent a good deal of time taking pictures with measuring rules before they disturbed the mud . They sluiced gently with water to take off the bulk of the clinging brown silt , the better to see the body 's contours . They bent and cautiously removed most of the mud coating , in gloved handfuls . A mud-veiled face , a thin , flat-chested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the legs would n't give up their silty coating , like a drape of blanket . The coroner tested the arm , scraping with his gloved finger , saw how well the flesh seemed to be preserved ; it did n't pulp or shred . That mud made a tidy coating , he noted , clay sealing the skin from edema , from aerobic microbes . A mucousy mass around the nose and mouth . Carefully , they began to pry up the carcass , and during an upthrust of the round-edged spade the body said , Ow . <p> The patrolman dropped the spade , letting the shoulder slip back down . Ow , whispered the brown lips again . <p> Jenkins , the coroner , gestured for more buckets of sludgy water , slopped little splashes on the sideways face , the brows , the brown-clad lips-a moan . Just gas escaping , he said . Then two , three bucketfuls dashed over the body . The shape very slowly slid toward one side , almost appeared to tremble . Curiosity got the better of Jenkins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear to the dark , slippery chest , and felt the tremor , heard the impossibly slow , impossibly real syncopation within . And yet there was no breath hissing from the lips , no rise and fall of the sternum . <p> Groenig , take a listen , he said , kneeling back . I 'm hearing things . His younger assistant gingerly knelt in the mud , wiped feebly at the skin , pressed his face alongside ; his eyes widened and brightened , his face turned the question to his boss . <p> I 'll be damned , said Jenkins . Now this is ugly . <p> It was only after the ambulance arrived and the mud had been further wiped away that they discovered how something , apparently in odd , semi-anaerobic decay , had melted and fused over the legs so that the genitalia vanished and the limbs softened and merged , perhaps in rigor , like the tail of a large brown tadpole . The EKG kept up a steady , strange rhythm-noting not the usual lup-dub but a slow bump . . . bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next bump was n't coming at all , a galloping kitty-kitty-kitty Bump . <p> Persistent vegetative coma , the junior EMT said confidently , as he hooked up an IV in the arm . <p> I 've heard of survival without oxygen in cold-water hypothermia , his female partner said , but it 's April , for chrissakes , and where 's the water ? <p> But when they swabbed the inert face with alcohol wipes , it remained brown and cold , the lips breathless under the oxygen mask . <p> Eater at the hospital it was the ER nurse , gently wiping the muddy , degraded legs with a moist towel , who noticed the round , dull scales left behind on the terrycloth . After a hurried conference with the attending , the nurse manager , and an intern , they carted the mysterious carcass to the shower , lowered the gurney gently down , unhooked the EKG leads , and let lukewarm water play over the figure . <p> After only two or three minutes , first one creaseless eyelid , then the other , popped open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lips shuddered apart , sipping then expelling air at last : Ohhh . <p> Yup , said Doc Hastings , who was due to retire in a couple months . Well , I never . He rubbed at his wiry white hair . What we got here is some kinda hibernating mermaid , I expect . <p> It gazed at them , strange eyes appearing mildly astonished , head lolling like it was drunk or very sleepy . <p> Give her thirty minutes in here at sixty-five degrees and put some restraints on the thorax and tail so she do n't roll off , he said . Start a glucose drip-no wait , God knows what we got , let 's run some chemistry first . When the intern stalled , he barked , You can do your gawking later . Hop to ! <p> Atwood , the nurse who 'd noticed the scales , sat with the creature as it slowly shook awake . First a flex and release of shoulders , a shudder in the tail , a slow undulation beginning at the little finger which had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sleepy schoolgirl . The nurse turned off the shower , daubed at the clammy skin , draped the being carefully with a johnny to cover its body . The olive-drab creature blinked , then slowly clasped the edge of the fabric and pulled it away carefully , let it drop to the wet tile floor . It held still except for a tremor , watching Atwood with eyes that appeared wary . <p> The nurse summoned Doc Hastings and the intern , who moved slowly and whispered . It did n't look like what any of them would call a mermaid . All over , the creature was an olive-tan color , from hair to tail , slightly deeper at the tail-tip . It surely was n't a picture-book mermaid-there was no brightly scaled trunk , no whale-like flipper , nothing voluptuously female and human . On this creature , the normal ellipse of a somewhat flat-breasted human torso tapered to a cylinder at the waist , then flattened into a muscular , eel-like end with continuous , rippling fins above and below . The spine dove centrally into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly . Upon close inspection , there were a half-dozen pale aqua dots , no bigger than a pencil eraser , running down the midline of the tail on either side . A pale-green scar , an are about twelve inches long , rose on the back , below the dorsal fin and behind what would be the left knee . Sparse , fine hair clung over vestigial ears , merest flaps of flesh protecting the ear canals . Ribs , collarbones , and face-bones protruded clearly . A fine musculature , perhaps slightly wasted , showed through thin , fatless skin . No noteworthy breasts or external genitalia showed , but perhaps from a narrowness of shoulders , perhaps from the mythological precedent , they were inclined to call it a she . <p> How did you know ? whispered Atwood . <p> Doc Hastings coughed , a-hep-hep-hep , in the way he did when talking to pesky medical students and administrators . Well , you know . Just something I heard about once or twice . <p> Man , the others wo n't believe this ! said Furnari , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc 's brows charged together . Do n't you breathe a word of this till I talk to some people , neither of you ! he said . Let 's just call this quarantine for the moment . I mean it , he said to Furnari . I 'll can your little pipsqueak ass , so help me . <p> And he 'll do it , too , said Atwood to the gaping intern . I 've seen him . <p> You bet , the doc told him . <p> The creature-it , she-watched them with unblinking , weed-green eyes . <p> Doc Hasting 's neighbor Chuck had an above-ground pool that he did n't use much now that his kids had all left home . They drained it , and the fire department sent a tanker to load up with water from the Green River , which did n't have as much heavy metal and dioxin contamination , and they used that to fill the pool . Doc swore them all to secrecy , partly by letting Chuck pretend to be FBI , which he did by hastily flashing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from the university told Chuck he might get a little algae build-up , but to keep the water circulating and aerated . Chuck strung his laundry line a little higher on the other neighbors ' side and hung his tarps and tents on it . <p> The humans all watched the mermaid slip into the pool with a squirm of urgency or relief . She plunged straight down and stayed there ; after eighty-six seconds she somersaulted , circled down , breached the surface again , shook her lank hair , seemed to smile . The long , eel-like tail seemed less like a defect in the water ; it flexed and rippled , undulated the flanged dorsal and ventral fins . For the first hour she patiently circled the pool walls , its bottom . Then she swam submerged to the eyes , watching them . How fascinating , the biology professor kept saying . He could n't believe his own eyes . Fascinating . Mud-puppy , moray . Tadpole . <p> Tadpole ? What does it turn into ? said the second professor , the anthropologist . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the first . <p> Doc Hastings said , It just hibernates through the winters . Tucks down into the silt and nods off . <p> The biologist gaped , then nodded . So , uh , I guess the current of the spring snowmelt brings them around again . He wondered out loud whether the mermaid had lain there with her reduced metabolism for perhaps twelve years , since drainage ditches of the housing development had starved the narrow creek , or even decades longer . He had never heard of a freshwater mermaid , a prairie mermaid , a mermaid hibernating under frost-rimed cottonwoods . <p> Oh , sure , said Doc Hastings , rubbing at the bristles in one ear . I mean , the stories go . . . my grandpa used to say , but nobody took him seriously . . . he said spirits in the cornfield , meteor craters past the fairgrounds , too . Those old-timers were full of great stories . Not so many old-timers left around here . Hem . Look how she 's watching us . Wonder if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's the last one , the biologist said . <p> Indigenous , the second professor guessed . Lakota , Ankara , she said , looking at the mermaid 's greeny-brown skin , but mostly at the planes of her face , the nose , the broad cheekbones , brow . She could be a missing link . <p> The face looks human , but it 's those eyes that get you , said Doc . All green , no visible sclera , wide and fishy . To himself he thought , Something wise in there , and wild , too . <p> At first she gobbled as if she truly had n't eaten in years . To ascertain her tastes , over the next days they gave her an array of edibles , human and aquatic , from ravioli to pemmican , maggots to crayfish , arrowroot , corn , limp strands of elodea . Her coos and burbles greeted an array of freshwater delicacies . She spilled the tray into the water , slurped the tidbits as they floated . Certain fat brown larvae and nymphs , fish roe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They noted that after she ate , she usually preferred to lounge supine , only her face above the surface , like an otter , rather than perch upright . <p> Doc Hastings 's kids , when they were little , had tried to rescue various wild things over the years-tiny , orphaned cottontails , finches and waxwings defrocked by housecats . Having seen so many failures and successes with the wild ones , he was wary of jumping to conclusions , of ascribing human attributes to the creature . He 'd always told the kids , Now , do n't get attached . But he tended to think food made her friendly . He thought he saw a smile now and then . Chuck said he 'd swear she liked having the company , and added , Once she got used to all of our loud , furry faces . <p> A few days later , after circumspect petitioning and negotiation , the creature was quietly moved to the shorter of the university 's outdoor pools , which was used chiefly for water aerobics and open rec hours , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be kept on the QT as long as possible ; announcements of pool remodeling were posted all over campus . Once over the agitation of her move , the mermaid-thing was curious and not easily startled . At first the roar of loud trucks and jets made her flinch and dive to the bottom , but she quickly learned to ignore such noises . <p> She made certain high-pitched calls and gurgles at feeding time , certain strange clicks , but it was n't until the anthropologist brought in a linguist that she showed any interest at all in speech . A word for sun was the first to make her face turn , her eyes glint in recognition . He repeated it ; she quickly looked overhead at the sky . <p> Siouan family : Mandan , Hidatsa , said the linguist . <p> What 's that ? said the biologist . <p> Tribes of the upper plains . Mostly pushed out by the Lakota , killed by smallpox from the Europeans . Fish ? he asked in the same tongue . When he held up a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish . But when he tried an Iroquois language , she repeated the word in a reedy voice , giving what seemed a happy slap of the tail . <p> A regular My Fair Lady , said Chuck , who was waiting patiently in the hope he 'd be allowed to toss minnows in the pool . The royn in Spoyn stoys moynly . . . <p> She greeted the humans almost eagerly after that . By experimenting with the languages of several indigenous nations , they formed a pidgin with which they could communicate . Then she began to pick up English with astonishing rapidity . She referred to herself as something that sounded like Twee , although the linguists noted a more subtle distinction of aspirated vowel , and were unclear whether this were a name , a personal pronoun , or some other part of speech . She quickly learned to say " stop " and " more " during her feedings , " people " when she wanted company , followed by " sleep , " and " now . " By the end of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had problems verbalizing concepts of spatial relations , here versus there , back and forward , and possessives . She could n't seem to grasp tenses of past and present , which caused them some difficulty in communication . Blanchette , a scholar of indigenous languages and an Ojibwe , explained that concepts of time and space did n't exist the same way in such languages . In fact , they found that Twee delineated her sense of time by " sleep " and " swim . " The day the heater faltered and the temperature of the pool dropped to fifty-seven she grew agitated , calling Sleep ! Sleep ! to the expert observing her that afternoon , and scrabbled wildly at the pool 's bottom so that her browny-green fingers bled thin blood when she surfaced . The professors concluded that cold had signaled hibernation to her , and she was frantic with the lack of sludge and sediment in the concrete pool . Smooth river rocks , lake-tumbled ovals of basalt and granite , clean sand , were brought in to soothe her . <p> The graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Twee did n't seem to form the same kind of attachment ; she seemed to have a hard time distinguishing individuals . The biology professor noticed that she seemed to rely on hearing far more than sight . As a security measure , her caretakers were given a pattern of code words to trade with Twee , before feedings and such-she thought it was a new game . She was so trusting , the experts said , it seemed that such precautions were necessary . <p> Twee seemed more at ease once she could communicate . She was even asking to go to her one-time home . They attempted to explain to her that the creek was dead , but she met their remarks with those wide weed-green eyes and a placid and patient expression . After much debate , they fashioned a special moisture-retaining wrap for her tail , let her lie on a gurney in an ambulance donated for the occasion . She hummed to herself in her whistling way . Once there , anyone peeking through the trees must have thought it was an odd visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of the gurney tucked over the tail . It was just after sunrise , and the grass was still dewy ; water striders etched the surface of the creek bed 's few puddles . When they wheeled Twee down to the creek 's edge to see its bare , silting bed , she grew quiet . Dead , they explained . The linguist carefully explained the diverted water-he invoked the mighty beaver for analogy-and how it killed the creek . The sundry experts never could tell much by her facial expression , but Twee seemed thoughtful . <p> In her characteristic confusion of tenses , she said , I do n't stop water . Humans stop water . She snorted audibly through her flat nostrils . She paused and began trying out her new vocabulary , pointing her thin fingers : Tree . Tree . Sun . Bird . She looked down into the creek bed , made a little whirring sound , a click . Dead , she said . <p> Word got out within two months of the move to the university 's pool . Immediately there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In mid-June , reporters from television stations , first in Pierre and Bismarck , then from all around the country , were set up with weekly-rental hotel suites . ASTOUNDING FISH-WOMAN FOUND ! cackled the tabloids ' banner headlines . An Ad Hoc Twee Care Advisory Committee had been formed , including a big-shot anthropologist from New York and experts from freshwater aquariums . Offers came rolling in : The Discovery Channel said they 'd build Twee a simulated creek of her own , in exchange for rights to round-the-clock video coverage . Revlon wanted a deal in which they 'd underwrite Twee 's care in exchange for the rights to put her name on a new makeup line in greens and browns ; her unusual skin tone would fit with their multiethnic marketing strategy , but they 'd have to try focus groups first . These and other ideas came flooding in while various government officials , agencies , branches , and nonprofit foundations tried to figure out who was authorized to speak for Twee . The American Indian Movement weighed in , and the World Wildlife Fund , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission , the university had opened viewing hours from one to three p.m. on weekends and Wednesdays . The university put security guards outside the gate and at the pool . School officials held meetings to discuss whether certain male visitors were exploiting Twee by ogling her not-very-well-developed breasts-but since Twee herself disdained all garments , they decided that as long as the line kept moving , it was okay . By late June they 'd discovered they needed to provide a canopy for most of the pool to keep her from sunburn . <p> Twee put up with the demands of science and publicity with fairly good grace . There was a scare around the Fourth of July when a man hopped the guardrail during viewing hours and dove into the pool with what looked like a knife . Guards jumped in after him and found it was only a penlight , but after that , they put up a metal detector at the gate in addition to the guards and had twenty-four-hour coverage by biology and veterinary students . The episode unnerved her caretakers more than it did Twee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging from her willingness to submit to blood-drawing for samples ; she permitted arm-strength tests from the physical therapists . Even though the experts were falling all over themselves to learn about her anatomy and behavior , the ad hoc advisory committee figured they did n't want to subject her to the confines of an MRI scanner just yet , not until her English improved to the point where she could really give informed consent . However , she could n't bear to have the midline portion of her tail touched-she 'd twitch and shy away even before contact . <p> Must correlate to the lateral line in fish , commented Schiffer , the biology professor , an extra sense . She can feel the touch coming through the water . <p> Fish make up for their peanut brains with some amazing neurology , said the visiting Doc Hastings , fanning a hat over his sweating forehead . Sixth sense . I tangled with enough walleye to know that . <p> Doc Hastings had retired June 1st , and he came by at least once a week , since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looping around to get a look at Twee in her pool , nor the bleacher seats full of hooting children . He muttered , Poor thing 's got no home and barely learned her English , and here they got her on show , and now all hell 's breaking loose . Sometimes he wished the creature had never been found , for her sake . He figured that Twee would like a quiet day in the country even more than he did , it being her native state . The thing belonged with the other mysterious , mud-colored beauties of the plains : the striped earth of Dakota Badlands , yellow-headed blackbirds , Byzantine-patterned rattlers , a beauty as furtive as underground water that made the thrifty prickly pear and grasses bloom . He felt a strange protectiveness , born of scientific curiosity and an organic sense of the holy in the green creature . <p> Usually he 'd corner one of the graduate students , like humorless Deniece , or Matthew , who staffed the quiet Thursday and Sunday nights , to convey his complaints . Lemme tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , Have I told you my gramps thought he saw one of these ? One day when he was out tilling . . . <p> Matthew was an earnest , big-eared biology student who preferred to talk physiology with Doc . What did he think about the permeability of her skin ? Why skin and not scales above the waist ? Could Doc explain to him how her blood chemistry compared to human ? What about hemoglobin ? <p> When Matthew was n't picking his brain , Cassie , an **26;1636;TOOLONG , chased him with a tape recorder in hope of collecting his " folktales . " After all , they held the best hope of capturing any kind of history , she said ; there was so much to learn about Twee since she 'd been rescued from the creek bed . <p> Now that 's damn anthropologist talk if you think we rescued her , Doc admonished . Not scientific at all . Do n't go thinking we 're doing her any favors . She 's a wild thing , and nature has her own ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I suppose you 're right , said Matthew . <p> Cassie , chastened , nonetheless stuck to the topic of folklore , probed and clarified . <p> Well , it 's not so much folktales as just things my gramps would tell , and those old-timers , Doc said , watching Twee gobble down some small fry . No , he never heard tell of these mermaids seducing farmers and laborers . No , he did n't recall they pointed anyone to hidden springs . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , young lady , he said , but the ones I heard was mostly someone catching a glimpse of one sunning on a flat slab of rock . What do you think of those strange eyes of hers ? Like to get in there with an ophthalmoscope one of these days ; wonder what her retinas look like . Poor mermaid gal , I bet she just wants to be left alone . We do n't need to think we know every damn thing in the universe this minute . No , I never heard they were enchanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . <p> Contrary to Doc Hasting 's suppositions , Twee obviously liked to sing ; at first , just her own high-pitched calls . The first tune she 'd learned , the linguist having a rather juvenile sense of humor and an ill-developed sense of posterity , was " Row Row Row Your Boat . " She liked to sing with the visiting children . Sometimes she 'd have thirty or forty people singing " Row Row Row Your Boat . " She liked visitors to teach her songs , although when she tried to return the favor , they complained among themselves that she sounded like Yoko Ono at her worst . Of course , the ethnomusicologists came running with their Sony recording equipment . <p> To the dismay of some of her caretakers , Twee seemed to have something of the performer in her ; at the least , she seemed to enjoy visitors ' days . Sometimes she liked to play with the balls or diving rings , to breach and splash , antics which delighted the lucky visitors . On a Wednesday afternoon , Twee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis ball underhand back and forth to them . A funny cackling call seemed her mimicry of their laughter ; she also imitated the gurgle of the pool 's heater and the bleeping of pagers . <p> Dr. Virginie Lefevre , a French behaviorist known for her research on cognition in dolphins , was doing some testing with Twee that day . On this occasion , she was tossing rings . Usually when they played this " game , " Twee would wait till they hit bottom , then retrieve them carefully , dropping them into the doctor 's waiting palm . Today the expert was trying to see if Twee could conceptualize size-big and small . She 'd been coaching Twee on these words with different size rings . Now she threw all three far across the pool . Twee , get only small , she instructed . Twee dove down and retrieved all three . The scientist patiently held up the rings again , leaning over the pool 's edge . <p> Small . Big . Big . Find small , she asked . <p> Twee pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get small . Get only small . Again , she threw all the rings ; again , Twee brought them all back , and the children in the stands applauded . Twee glided on her back , clapping along with the excited schoolchildren , who knew how to be an audience much better than how to be scholarly observers . <p> Hey ! yelled a girl in a shirt that said " Britney . " Why do n't you train her to jump through hoops ? Like the dolphins ? <p> I do not want to train her , said Dr. Lefevre . This is n't a show . I am a scientist , and she 's not a pet . <p> She ca n't jump as far as an orca , said a boy wearing two baseball caps on top of each other . And she do n't sing that good . <p> An orca is smarter than are you , said the scientist , almost loudly enough . <p> Kids , be respectful , said their teacher halfheartedly while trying to focus her camera on the moving target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is moins distractions , murmured Lefevre . <p> The Sea World people , who also understood audiences , actually wanted Twee to come live with dolphins in a tank . Schiffer , the biology professor , had to explain repeatedly and with fading patience , to successive flunkies who called him , exactly why salt water would n't be good for Twee . <p> She ca n't just regulate her sodium intake like an estuarine worm , Schiffer said . She 'd dry out , she 'd die . But the pencil pushers could n't seem to grasp even this common freshman-level model of marine studies . <p> The Discovery Channel 's proposal also ran into more difficulties when Twee announced to a group of schoolchildren-Mrs . Sundquist 's , actually-that she intended to : Go school . She wanted to learn to read , she told the graduate students who habitually scribbled observations about her in lab notebooks . The mayor had a fit when this idea hit the TV news , rightly envisioning the fuss that followed . Private schools publicly offered scholarships . The school superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools . Advocates for the differently abled talked about getting her equal access , wheelchairs , and plasticized tail sheaths . For the moment , she was given a tutor , and learned to read using the phonics method in mere weeks . She kept trying to take books and worksheets underwater , so they had to be laminated . Chatty news anchors started making smart-dolphin analogies , and Sea World began calling again . By then it was late July . Twee asked if there were any schools in the woods ; she said that she missed the trees . They brought in potted ones . <p> The prairie creature was singing for the visitors , reading her large-print laminate of the abridged Wind in the Willows and a picture book of Native American Myths and Legends provided by a local AIM member to remind her of " her heritage . " She had put on flesh from the diet of fat grubs and slender fish , special algae-based supplements the professors had formulated . Yet she also had somber moods that she declined to explain , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before sunrise they would find her gliding just below the surface , occasionally making high-pitched calls underwater , then into the air ; she would pause , as if waiting , then slowly submerge . She did n't respond to them at those times , as if she were swimming in her sleep . <p> Deniece liked to probe Twee 's indigenous vocabulary , showing her flashcards or objects . Whenever she asked how Twee had learned to speak in her own tongue , the creature replied , I hear it-but it was unclear from where or whom . Matthew , the biology student , wrote detailed notes about her movements and diet and occasionally asked Twee if he could take her pulse or temperature . He was both fascinated and repelled by her whiteless eyes and the smooth , featureless slope of scalp around her ear canals . Likewise , Twee found Matthew 's noticeable human ears intriguing . It started as curiosity and became a game . She 'd order him close to the water , then would poke and pull at his ears with her fingers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say , tugging at his ear . Fungus . He imagined her laughing when she did this , but that dynamic of emotion did n't seem to exist in her . He said to Professor Schiffer one day , She 's like a housecat ; she has moods , she 's capable of showing pleasure , fear , pain , familiarity , but I ca n't imagine her waiting by the door for any master . <p> Well , she 's not domesticated , the professor reminded him , and she 's sure not human . We 're only beginning to guess what evolutionary processes have shaped her . It 's possible she 's some sort of bridge species , like a lungfish , he mused . That would make her a throwback to the Paleozoic-a missing Mississippian ? And yet humans did n't evolve till the Pleistocene epoch ; at earliest , Oligocene , when apes developed . She 's some sort of relic of the marine era on the plains . <p> I like to think there 's others of her kind , Matthew said , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> One in a river , she said . Only . She said the same thing or a variant thereof every time he asked , but they could never figure out if she meant each stream only supported one such creature , or whether she was the only one living . Then she 'd invariably bring up school . She 'd say , Twee go school . Lots peoples , lots childrens : school . <p> Matthew hesitated to tell the professor that he thought school was her idea of company ; after all , he was probably imposing human behavior onto her again . But he wondered if hers was a social species , if she missed her companions . <p> Deniece had n't found a Tweeish translation for " school . " <p> Besides school , she wanted big water , she told them . She wanted big trees . They taught her to call that concept " Home . " Then they reminded her of what she 'd seen on her trip to the dry creek bed , moist only after rains , the surface mud cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dead . Home . <p> In the absence of weighty news from Wall Street , a standout summer movie , or world peace , the discovery of the prairie mermaid had spawned a national mania . Around the state , small boys and girls , grown men and women , with no particular interest in animal behavior , bought hip-waders and began churning up creek beds with coal shovels and garden rakes , looking for silted brown forms . The Department of Natural Resources got emergency funding from the legislature to hire more rangers and staff to patrol waterways , since the scavengers were stirring up silt and even old sludge-oil deposits , tainting drinking water and causing fish-kills . Anglers were grumpy , and the Time magazine cover of Twee only spurred the frenzy . Meanwhile , the university licensed the production of rubbery , floating figurines of Twee , Twee T-shirts and travel tumblers , the recording " Songs of the Mermaid , " to help support the cost of her care until things could be decided . <p> The federal government was still grappling with whether Twee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under the Endangered Species Act and which agency should have jurisdiction over her fate . Amnesty International , concerned that she was being held without consent , sent a senior investigator to interview her . No , she was content , she said , with a little help from Deniece-she missed Home , but since the water had stopped running , there was no life for her there-someday she might like bigger water . And School . Amnesty International met with the Sierra Club about legal challenges , while the Department of the Interior held endless hearings . In August , an official , temporary Board of Trustees made up of various scientific and cultural experts-including the biologist but not the linguist-was appointed to safeguard her welfare . Doc Hastings read about the trustees in the paper and commented aloud to the spirit of dear departed Mrs. Hastings over breakfast , as he often did on perplexing matters , that this was a fine kettle offish , pardon the pun , for the poor mermaid gal ; you could n't help but feel a bit sorry for her , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just not right , he muttered over his whole-wheat toast . Like making a fox into a house dog . Later on , he and Chuck would hatch schemes for the betterment of Twee 's life over the back fence before adjourning for a beer and a shot . <p> All the press coverage and the Amnesty International challenge brought in the animal rights activists . It started with a few picketers sporting " Free Twee " placards in front of the university . One of the grad students was secretly a sympathizer . It was on a moonless night that he fogged the cameras , sent Neil the security guard to investigate his report of a damaged lock , so the van could sidle past the emergency exit of the basketball arena and around to the pool . He told Twee they were taking her to school . Twee was delighted , as far as one could tell . She sang one of her shrieky tunes , and they helped her out onto a rubberized tarp , which was smeared with gel to protect her scales , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told them of her trip to the creek . The student sang with her in the back of the van and laughed . They traveled for about an hour , then the van backed down a paved boat ramp , toward the river . <p> Alder grew thickly over the banks next to the ramp ; current fractured the surface of the broad river into gray flint , obsidian . The three of them stood next to the van and waved their arms enthusiastically . There , they said gleefully to Twee , you wanted bigger water , you are free-but she did n't understand free , did n't understand the game . When they slid her out of the van and she caught sight of the dark slide of the water , the churn of its current , she asked warily , School ? And they laughed and said , No , bigger water . A nice big river . <p> No , I want go school , she said , still having problems with her infinitives and verb tenses . I want read , I want books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explained Matthew , the biology student . It 's clean water , no dioxin , no phosphate overload , lots offish , larvae . Here , I 'll go in with you . It 's okay . <p> They carried her down to the river and gently unfurled the tarp , slid her into the cool water . Matthew walked in up to his shorts to reassure her . She slipped out from under his hand . <p> Now you 're free , he said again , and the others around him beamed and repeated it , Free , free . Your new home , they said . <p> But Twee clenched her hands down into the mud , heaved herself half onto the ramp , wincing as her sensitive tail scraped on the rough concrete . Home . Dead , she said . She glowered at the river . Stop , she told them , a word she knew well . Dead . Stop . Too big . Stop . <p> I know this is sudden , Matthew said , but it had to be a surprise . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She 's just having separation anxiety , said one of his cohorts , a girl with shrubby red brows and hair . It 's to be expected . Stockholm syndrome : she 's identified with her captors . She has to learn to fend for herself again . <p> She belongs in the wild . I 'll miss her , said Matthew , wading from the water . But I 'll be glad she has her freedom . He sniffled back his tears . <p> Twee slid low into the water , clinging along the bank . They threw her a handful of mayfly nymphs and fish , and they left her there , submerged up to her neck beside the boat ramp , looking out at the swift , dark current . They could n't see her hidden profile as they pulled away , could n't hear while they were singing and congratulating themselves and saying that surely now they 'd earned a trip to England to liberate some captive mink . <p> She stayed there long after the van left . The river was cold . It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faraway sea . With her chin in the water , Twee let out one of her strange , high-pitched cries , waited without a reaction . She slipped under the water and crept close to the bank , surfaced beneath the outstretched arms of the alder , hesitated . Then , working her long tail against the current , she began her halting way upstream . <p>
