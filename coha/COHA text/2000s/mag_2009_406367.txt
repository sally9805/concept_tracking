He 's the passionate host of David Rocco 's Dolce Vita on Canada 's Food Network . He is a driving force behind a project aimed at getting Ontario schoolchildren eating healthier . But what gets David Rocco most excited is being a dad , to one-year-old twins Giorgia and Emma . Rocco talked to Today 's Parent editor Caroline Connell about his greatest joys : parenthood and wonderful food . What 's the best thing about becoming a father ? It just gets better every day - the joy of walking through the door and seeing the girls ' smiles and how excited they get . And every day there 's something new that they do . My wife had a really rough pregnancy , and the girls were born two months early , at 3 1/2 pounds each . Being first-time parents , that was a concern , obviously . But now they 're doing amazing ! We brought them to Italy with us when they were five months old .... They 're very active in what we do . What 's been the biggest surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out we were having twins , people 's eyes would pop out - I 'm talking about family , people who knew how much work a single baby is . I was thinking , you know , how bad can it be ? We 'll have help , mother , mother-in-law ... it will be great . Well , it is so much work . But the rewards are double . We do a lot of attachment parenting ; my wife is an extremely committed mother and I 'm a hands-on father . It 's getting a little easier now , especially since we 're starting to see the twins sleeping longer . What does it mean to you to be a hands-on father ? Being involved , not just evenings and weekends , but in the daily stuff . I 'm lucky because my office is 100 metres from where we live , so I pop in at lunchtime and sometimes I plan it so I can do a feed . That 's fun . I just love seeing them tasting a new food for the first time . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she puckered from the sour taste ! I try to make it a daily ritual - my break in the day to pop in and spend time with them , changing diapers , all that stuff that my father did n't do . My dad was a wonderful father , never missed a soccer game or a hockey game , but there were things he did n't do . As a grandfather now , he always comments on how lucky we are in this generation that men are more aware and have the opportunity and the desire to be involved at that level . You grew up in an Italian family in Toronto . What role did food play in your home ? In my family , food obviously was big . It was an opportunity to bring the family together . The kitchen was the focal point of our home . Meals were not just to get full ; there was no TV on , so meals were a way for our family to connect with each other . I was introduced to cooking - to seeing my parents cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early age . What attitudes are we teaching kids today about food ? I think as a society we 've lost the importance of the simplicity of cooking - taking a tomato from the garden . I mean , that 's how I grew up . Cooking can be simple . It 's a life skill that I think should be passed on to kids . Unfortunately , we have n't spent time cultivating that . My mom would actually use cooking as a way to connect with us , have a family dialogue , whether we were peeling potatoes or chopping tomatoes . And there 's something magical about cooking with kids ; they 're more inclined to want to eat what 's prepared . So those green vegetables - say sauted rapini or spinach , that would make most kids say , " Eeew , yucky " well , now they wont to eat them because they were involved in the preparation . Do you think there 's something parents should be doing differently around food ? Mmm , I 'm going to get into trouble ! But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new foods . It 's a lot of work , so mothers and fathers say , " Little Johnny does n't like broccoli so I 'm just going to keep giving him hot dogs and chicken fingers . " When we were growing up , my parents would say , " This is what we 're eating and if you do n't want to eat it , that 's no problem . But I 'm not going to make you something else , and you do n't eat anything else . " Today I think many mothers and fathers get guilted into making a separate kids ' meal . What would you suggest to a parent who says , " That 's great , but I get home at six o'clock and my kids are hungry , and those fish sticks are right in the freezer . I do n't have time to cook from scratch " ? First of all , I think cooking from scratch is cheaper especially now that the economy 's not great . You can feed a family of four for a lot less than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to rely on ordering a pizza . When I was in college , I used to tease my buddies , tell them we could eat better in less time than it would take for a pizza to arrive . If you can make it fun and get the kids to help you , it 's probably less work than most people think . It 's about getting into the groove , opening up a can of , say , chickpeas . Take a little bit of olive oil , saut some garlic or some onions diced up , then rinse the chickpeas and mush up half of them , then add some water and let it simmer for 10 minutes . You have a fantastic soup . You want to add some potatoes , add potatoes . You want to add some leftover pasta , start breaking it up . It 's a onepot meal and , literally , it 's done in 15 minutes . How do you plan to get your own daughters involved in the kitchen ? We 're doing it already . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . I 'll give them some of the ingredients - for example , a tomato - just let them hold it , play with it , smell it , bite into it . And I talk to them when I 'm cooking , so they know that food is social , it 's interactive , and it brings families together . How important is it to teach kids about healthy nutrition - you know , trans fats , sodium ... ? If we make it too technical , if we do n't make it fun , it sounds preachy . We have to make a heart connection with kids , introduce them to ingredients , get them excited . Sodium ? When you cook a simple meal like tomato sauce ( see recipe , p. 61 ) , sodium is never an issue . For one of the Ontario pilot programs I did at a school in North Bay , we made a cold couscous salad . The teacher had the students in little groups , each with the recipe and all the ingredients . The first thing I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , take the printed recipe and throw it out . I want you guys to have fun ! This is about a canvas and paint , and you guys are artists . If the recipe calls for half a cup of cherry tomatoes and a cup of cucumber , and you feel like a cup of cherry tomatoes and half a cup of cucumber , go for it ! " Then I had all the students go into each other 's groups and make the salad together , and it was such a fun experience . They felt excited and empowered . So you encourage people to cook ... ... with their eyes and their stomach and intuition ! Tell me more about your work in Ontario schools . The premier 's office called me last year to help promote the new bill that was passed to eliminate trans fats . So I said that now is an opportunity , if I 'm going to come on board , to teach kids how to cook - making this as important as math , science and geography at the high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we say , " Guys , we 're going to change the school cafeteria system - we 're going to eliminate french fries and serve only couscous , " kids are going to say , " Yeah , that 's nice . Now I 'm going to go next door to the strip plaza and have pizza . " And so we just finished a pilot program in four schools where we introduced recipes , then those recipes actually became part of the cafeteria food . So what I 'm hoping to do is take it beyond the cafeteria and make it part of the curriculum . Part of the program , hopefully , will be teaching the kids how to cook , bringing it back home to cook for their families , even keeping a journal . I want them to see that it 's a whole process , not just cooking because we have to feed ourselves .
