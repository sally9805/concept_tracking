Tom Hanks remembers the precise moment the moon made his head explode  --  or at least that 's how he describes it . It was December 1972 , and Hanks ran home from school to see the transmissions that the Apollo 17 astronauts were beaming back live from the surface of the moon . " There was no lunar module in sight , " Hanks says . " All you could see were the astronauts in the distance as the camera panned around this incredibly alien , incredibly desolate place . I was just gone . " <P> A lot of boomers  --  especially boy boomers  --  snapped their terrestrial moorings the same way back then . But in the 33 years of space travel that followed  --  33 years defined by a fallow manned program and two lost shuttle crews  --  most of them shook off their moon bliss entirely . Not so Hanks . <P> At 49 years old , the actor , director and producer has made something of a second career out of spreading the lunar word , first with his star turn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , From the Earth to the Moon . Now Hanks is working the space beat again , preparing for this month 's release of Magnificent Desolation : Walking on the Moon 3D , co-produced by IMAX and Hanks ' own production company , Playtone . A 3-D , 70-mm , giant-screen spectacle that Hanks co-wrote and narrates , the movie re-creates what it 's like to travel to the moon , bound around on the surface and head back home . Conventional movies have given viewers a sense of this before . The IMAX production , Hanks hopes , will swallow them up whole . " The moon landings affected us emotionally , intellectually , spiritually , " he says . " I want to make that experience as visceral for people as possible . " <P> What is it about the pull of the moon that holds Hanks fast ? Why does a high-powered Hollywood player with the muscle to tackle pretty much any production he wants keep returning to his lunar love ? <P> In the cavernous conference room of the IMAX headquarters in Santa Monica , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . He looks like a man getting over a cold  --  coughing , sipping hot tea and racing to get through the last few weeks of postproduction before heading to Europe to begin shooting his next superproject , The Da Vinci Code . <P> Hanks has good reason to feel worn out . To re-create a flight to the moon , Playtone and IMAX filled a Los Angeles soundstage with Styrofoam , concrete and pulverized roofing tiles  --  the simulated lunar surface  --  and borrowed exact replicas of a lunar module and lunar rover from the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center . They stitched together spacesuits from the boots up , rolled in a 240-lb. 3-D IMAX camera , in addition to the cameras director of photography Sean Phillips built himself , and rigged the entire set with a harness system to simulate the one-sixth-gravity bunny hop the astronauts would use to bound across the moonscape.
