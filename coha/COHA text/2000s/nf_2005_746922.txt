Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLE Abstract <p> We measured quality of life issues for both children and their parents on the premise that parental quality of life should be an aspect of cost-effectiveness in otitis media treatment . The patients were less than 18 years of age and had had myringotomy with tube insertion at the head and neck surgery department of a large health maintenance organization . Quality of life for patients , parents , and caregivers was evaluated by telephone survey of parents or caregivers and by retrospective chart review of the number of pre- and postoperative healthcare visits and antibiotic usage . Chart review showed a significant postoperative reduction in the number of clinic visits and in use of antibiotic drugs after insertion of tympanostomy tubes . Improved postoperative hearing was noted , and tympanostomy tube insertion was shown to be safe . The chart-review cost analysis showed that tympanostomy tube insertion is a cost-effective treatment for otitis media in children , and the telephone survey results showed that it improves quality of life for children and their parents or other caregivers . Introduction <p> Otitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 years old to visit a pediatrician . The socioeconomic costs have been estimated at more than $1.0 billion annually in the United States. ( n1 ) The use of tympanostomy tubes has effectively reduced overall frequency , duration , and severity of otitis media and has corrected conductive hearing loss secondary to otitis media , ( n2-n6 ) but its cost-effectiveness has not been determined . Quality of life of these patients and their parents or caregivers must be considered in the evaluation . <p> Surveys assessing quality of life have been proposed. ( n7-n9 ) Facione 's survey showed fewer visits and less antibiotic use after tubes were inserted , and he concluded that although children 's quality of life improved after insertion of tympanostomy tubes , a more accurate count of visits and antibiotic usage is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of this treatment. ( n8 ) <p> To determine quality-of-life changes both for affected children and their parents or other caregivers after insertion of tympanostomy tubes , we conducted a retrospective chart review and a telephone survey . Patients and methods <p> Using a **25;3423;TOOLONG database , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 years old who had had myringotomy with tube insertion at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland , Calif . ( KPMC-O ) between 1988 and 1994 . We collected data from 336 patient charts available for review . Of these 336 patients , we excluded 63 who either did not have a minimum of 1-year of preprocedural visits or postprocedural follow-up at KPMC-O , those who had had prior ear surgery , and those who had had myringotomy with tube insertion as part of a more extensive otologic procedure . All procedures were done by the head and neck surgery ( HNS ) department residents or staff . <p> For the 1-year periods before and after tympanostomy tube insertion , we recorded the number of clinic visits for ear-related problems , the number of courses of oral and topical antibiotics prescribed , and hearing loss as indicated by audiograms . A visit was counted if the presenting complaint was ear-related , if the visit was scheduled for otitis follow-up , or if the diagnosis of otitis media was documented as a major problem prompting the visit . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits were categorized as non-HNS visits ( i.e. , visits to the primary pediatrician , urgent care clinic , or emergency department ) or HNS visits . Postoperative visits were divided into non-HNS visits , HNS visits , and routine HNS visits ( postoperative visits scheduled at regular intervals ) . Any preoperative , intraoperative , or postoperative complication was recorded . Additional information entered into our database included patient age , sex , indication for tympanostomy tube insertion , and use of prophylactic antibiotics . <p> By telephone , we presented nine questions ( table 1 ) to a parent or other primary caregiver of all patients less than 18 years of age who had had myringotomy with tube insertion , as identified by the hospital 's database . Results were tabulated and analyzed . <p> We evaluated cost-effectiveness by using our chart-review results and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ( AHCPR ) estimate of $406 per patient-episode of medically managed otitis media ( including costs of physician office visits and prescription medications , and parental time off work ) and $2,174 per patient for myringotomy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental time off work , and surgical fees . ) Results <p> Chart review . For 273 patients ( 180 boys , 93 girls ) myringotomy with tube insertion was performed for serous ( 165 patients ) , recurrent ( 52 patients ) , and chronic ( 56 patients ) otitis . <p> Patients had a mean total of 10.6 visits in the 1-year study period before tympanostomy tube insertion . The mean number of visits for ear-related problems in the year after myringotomy and tube insertion was 2.8 ; that is , 7.8 visits fewer than before surgery ( p &lt; 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . Most visits were to providers outside the HNS department . Patients had a mean of 8.4 preoperative non-HNS visits and a mean of 2.2 preoperative HNS visits . In the postmyringotomy year , patients had a mean of 2.4 non-HNS visits , a mean of 0.4 HNS visits , and a mean of 2.5 routine HNS follow-up visits . Although the male-to-female ratio of patients receiving myringotomy and tube insertion was 2:1 , the two groups showed no significant difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patients received a mean of 3.9 more prescriptions for antibiotic drugs in the year before surgery than in the year after ( p &lt; 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . This variable also showed no significant difference between boys and girls . <p> The 114 patients ( 42% ) who had received prophylactic antibiotic therapy before surgery had a mean of 6.3 more preoperative and 1.2 more postoperative visits than those who had received no prophylactic antibiotics ( p &lt; 0.001 ) ( table 3 ) . Patients who received prophylactic antibiotics also had a mean of 4.2 more prescriptions for antibiotics preoperatively ( p &lt; 0.001 ) than patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics . The postoperative difference ( 0.5 prescriptions ) was not significant . <p> Audiograms were done preoperatively for 193 ( 71% ) of the patients and postoperatively for 117 ( 43% ) of the patients ; 91 ( 33% ) of the patients received both preoperative and postoperative audiograms . Of the 193 patients who received preoperative audiograms , 165 ( 85% ) showed heating loss . Of the 91 patients who had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing improvement after the surgery . <p> Preoperative complications secondary to otitis media included speech delay attributed to hearing deficits ( 9 patients ) ; multiple adverse reactions to antibiotic drugs ( 3 patients ) ; febrile seizure ( 2 patients ) ; and facial paralysis , sensorineural hearing loss , admission for dehydration , learning disability , meningitis , and admission for mastoiditis ( 1 patient each ) . <p> Seven patients had intraoperative complications with no deaths . There were three cases of laryngospasm and one case each of bronchospasm , upper airway edema , and misplaced tube in the middle ear . One procedure was aborted when cholesteatoma was encountered . <p> Among 135 patients for whom 165 postoperative complications were documented ( table 4 ) , 28 patients ( 21% ) had more than 1 complication . The most common complications were persistent tympanostomy tubes requiting a second procedure for removal , and repeat myringotomy with tube insertion ( table 4 ) . <p> Telephone survey . For 202 of the 379 patients ( 53% ) identified in the hospital database , a parent or caregiver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 participated in the survey , resulting in a response rate of 53% . Thirty-six respondents could not estimate the number of days off work or school prompted by the child 's ear infection , either before or after insertion of tympanostomy tubes . <p> Most respondents answered that the child 's ear problems ( 93% ) and overall quality of life ( 90% ) were better after tympanostomy tube insertion ( table 5 ) , and most stated that the child benefited from ( 96% ) and that they would recommend ( 93% ) the procedure ( table 5 ) . Ninety-one percent of respondents said that their own quality of life , too , had improved ( table 5 ) . <p> More than two thirds of respondents said that caring for their child with an ear infection was a great burden , and 5% denied having any burden ; 90% of respondents stated that their burden had decreased after tympanostomy tube insertion ( table 6 ) . <p> Respondents estimated that the child 's ear infections prompted a mean of 14.5 days off work or school before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the myringotomy . This difference of 12.1 days was significant ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Discussion <p> Cost-effectiveness is important in today 's healthcare environment . Tympanostomy tubes are effective for treating otitis media , but their cost-effectiveness has not been determined . <p> Based on a decrease in number of office visits and antibiotic usage , as well as the fact that healthy children do not visit a medical care provider , Facione concluded that tympanostomy tubes improve the quality of life for children with otitis media. ( n8 ) His results are supported by our chart review , which showed antibiotic usage and numbers of ear-related preoperative and postoperative visits similar to those reported by Facione . <p> Assuming that an episode of otitis media results in two visits  --  i.e. , the initial visit and the follow-up visit  --  our mean figure of 10.6 total visits in the preoperative year translates into 5.3 patient-episodes of otitis media annually . At an estimated $406 per patient-episode to treat medically , the yearly cost would be $2,152 per child . The estimated cost of myringotomy tubes is $2,174 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  related visits ( i.e. , 1.4 patient-episodes of otitis media ) results in a yearly cost of $2,742 per child . Managing otitis media with tympanostomy tubes thus costs $590 more than medical therapy alone in the first year after surgery . For the estimated 400,000 tympanostomy tube insertions done each year , $236 million would thus be saved if medical therapy were used instead . <p> Looking at the following year , if there continued to be only 1.4 patient-episodes of otitis media with tympanostomy tubes in place , the cost for that year would be $568 dollars per child with tubes . For that year , there would be a $1,584 savings for a child with tubes , assuming that a child without tubes would continue to have a mean of 5.3 patient-episodes of otitis media per year at a cost of $2,152 . For 400,000 myringotomy patients annually , about $634 million is thus saved during the second year after tympanostomy tube insertion , showing the procedure to be more cost-effective than medical therapy . ( This calculation did not consider that some tubes would have extruded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrown " their ear problems . ) <p> To further reduce the cost , we have instituted a telephone follow-up appointment system that replaces the routine postoperative office visit with a scheduled telephone call from a physician or a trained nurse at 4 to 10 days after surgery and every 6 months thereafter . Parents or other caregivers can choose a convenient time and location to receive the call . Preliminary surveys have indicated high parental satisfaction with these telephone visits , which are supplemented by a pediatrician 's assessment of tube status at routine well-child visits . A more extensive survey is under way to further evaluate these telephone visits . <p> Rosenfeld et al ( n7 ) found in their quality-of-life survey that parental concern is important . Most of our telephone survey respondents reported feeling greatly burdened in caring for the child with otitis media . Ninety percent of parents and other caregivers reported that their burden was decreased after tympanostomy tube insertion and that their overall quality of life had improved . Part of this improvement can be attributed to the dramatic decrease from an estimated 14.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 2.4 days off required after their insertion . Parents and other caregivers expressed great satisfaction with tympanostomy tube insertion , and most would recommend the procedure . Our results also indicated that from the parents ' or other caregivers ' viewpoint , the child 's ear problems and overall quality of life improved after tympanostomy tube placement . <p> In our chart review , we found only 9 cases in which a physician or a speech pathologist documented in the chart that a speech problem was a direct result of hearing impairment secondary to otitis media . The AHCPR stated that the effects of otitis media on speech and language development have been difficult to assess because of ethical problems in designing randomized , prospective studies and because no consistent instrument exists for measuring speech and language development. ( n1 ) Similarly , the long-term effects of otitis media on speech and language development after treatment are as yet undetermined and must be defined for more accurate determination of cost-effectiveness . If untreated otitis media can lead to permanent deficits in speech and language development , then the socioeconomic impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported the safety of tympanostomy tubes . Even though there appeared to be a relatively high complication rate , the complications themselves were relatively minor in nature and often could be addressed with clinic procedures . We perform many of our persistent tube removal and myringoplasty procedures for smaller perforations in the clinic with patients under local anesthesia . <p> More than 40% of the patients in our study had received prophylactic antibiotic treatment , which can be considered to have failed for these patients because they ultimately required insertion of tympanostomy tubes . We found that patients who had a history of prophylactic antibiotic use had many more office visits before and after tube placement than patients who had not received prophylactic antibiotics . This difference could be a result of selection bias , since we considered only patients referred for tube insertion . Another factor may be that those patients with a history of prophylaxis were more sick ( i.e. , they had more infections and visits , thus prompting prophylactic antibiotic therapy ) . Intuitively , patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics should have fewer infections and thus fewer visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection . On the other hand , our finding that prophylactic antibiotic therapy did not reduce the frequency of infection may be explained by bacterial resistance , as is found increasingly in organisms cultured in the United States from middle ear effusions. ( n10 ) If this trend continues , then bacterial resistance will have an increasing role in determining cost-effective treatment for otitis media . Conclusions <p> Our cost analysis suggests that tympanostomy tube insertion is cost-effective treatment for otitis media . These tubes can improve the quality of life for affected children and their parents/caregivers and greatly reduce the caregiving burden . Our findings emphasize that parental quality-of-life issues need to be included in validated instruments designed for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatment for otitis media .
