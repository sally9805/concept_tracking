In the Land of Canaan // The guard eyed me squarely as we approached his post , moving one hand from his belt to his walkie-talkie . His other arm rested on a rifle . He had gel in his hair and three stripes on his sleeve . " Yes ? " he said , arching his eyebrows . // It was 9:35 on a late-autumn morning when Avner and I strode toward the security checkpoint at the Damia Bridge , an Israeli-Jordanian border crossing about thirty miles north of Jericho . We had driven up from Jerusalem that morning to start the next phase of our journey , visiting sites in the Promised Land associated with Abraham , his son Isaac , and his son Jacob . Together they form the holy triumvirate of biblical forefathers , the patriarchs , from the Greek words patria , meaning family or clan , and arche , meaning ruler . The Five Books describe several forefathers who preceded these men , notably Adam and Noah , as well as many who follow . But the three patriarchs receive special distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom God grants his sacred covenant of territory , and through them that the relationship between the people of Israel and the Promised Land is forged . // The story of the patriarchs takes up the final thirty-nine chapters of Genesis and covers the entire geographical spectrum of the ancient Near East , from Mesopotamia to Egypt , and back again , all within several verses . For Avner and me , this scope posed a challenge . Soon after our return from Turkey , we huddled in the living room of his home in Jerusalem and set about devising an itinerary . It was a sunny , comfortable room , with whitewashed walls , bedouin rugs from the Sinai , and pictures of his two children , as well as the two daughters of his second wife , Edie , a Canadian who served as office manager for the Jerusalem bureau of the New York Times . Avner sat at the table with his computer , online Bible , countless topographical maps , dozens of archaeological texts , and the handheld GPS device , while I paced the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to relate any of the events in the Five Books to specific places , we were left to the often-contradictory claims of history , myth , legend , archaeobiology , paleozoology , and faith . There are nearly two dozen candidates for Mount Sinai , for example , and nearly half a dozen for the Red Sea . There are countless theories about which path the Israelites took through the Sinai . In addition , we faced the competing constraints of religious wars , political wars , terrorism , climate , budget , and health , as well as the desire to have fun . // Ultimately we settled on a guiding principle : Our goal was to place the biblical stories in the historical and cultural context of the ancient Near East . Time and again , rather than focus on every story in the text , or even every interesting story in the text , we decided to concentrate on stories that could be enhanced by being in the places themselves . The story of Jacob and his brother Esau wrestling in Rebekah 's womb , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely to be enriched by traveling to a specific location . The stories of Sodom and Gomorrah , by contrast , and the crossing of the Red Sea might easily take on new meanings by visiting their settings . In Judaism , the traditional process of analyzing scripture is called midrash , from the Hebrew term meaning search out or investigate ; in Christianity , this process is referred to as exegesis , from the Latin word meaning the same thing . In effect , what Avner and I undertook was topographical midrash , a geographical exegesis of the Bible . // In that spirit , we decided to begin our travels in Israel with a bit of a long shot . Our destination this morning was Shechem , the first place Abraham stops in Canaan and the next place the Bible mentions after Harran . The text makes no mention of what route Abraham , his wife , Sarah ( she 's actually called Sarai at the moment , as he is still called Abram ) , and his nephew Lot took to Canaan . Based on road patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places for him to cross into the Promised Land would have been a natural ford in the Jordan River just south of the Sea of Galilee , where the Damia Bridge is located today . Though we were already in the Promised Land , we decided to ask if the Israeli Army would let us walk across the bridge to the Jordanian side , then walk back , seeing what Abraham might have seen . Avner explained this idea to the sergeant , who remained at attention . After hearing the explanation , the officer removed his walkie-talkie and relayed our request . // The border post was astir that morning . It was a small crossing  --  the Jordan here is narrow enough for a horse to jump  --  but tidy , decorated with cacti , olive trees , and oleanders . The gate was blue and white . Every few minutes a Palestinian truck would approach , ferrying oranges , honeydew , or polished limestone . The driver would dismount and hand over his papers , which the guards would stamp and return . Then the guards would roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole process would start again . We were just becoming lulled by the routine , when suddenly we heard static on the walkie-talkie . The sergeant removed it and held it for us to hear : " I do n't care if they write a book about the Bible , " the voice said . " I do n't care if they rewrite the Bible itself . But they 're not going to do it in a military zone , and they 're not going to do it on my bridge . " // The sergeant replaced his walkie-talkie and shrugged . " Sorry , " he said , " only Palestinians . " // We returned to the highway and turned west toward the mountains . Shechem is located at the northern edge of the central spine of mountains that traverse much of Israel and the West Bank ... Continues ... //
