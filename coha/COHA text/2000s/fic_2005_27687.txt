Chapter One She was surviving ; the commute proved that much . Jamie Bryan took her position at the far end of the Staten Island Ferry , pressed her body against the railing , eyes on the place where the Twin Towers once stood . She could face it now , every day if she had to . The terrorist attacks had happened , the World Trade Center had collapsed , and the only man she 'd ever loved had gone down with them . Late fall was warmer than usual , and the breeze across the water washed over Jamie 's face . If she could do this-if she could make this journey three times a week while seven-year-old Sierra was at school-then she could get through another long , dark night . She could face the empty place in the bed beside her , face the longing for the man who had been her best friend , the one she 'd fallen for when she was only a girl . If she could do this , she could do anything . Jamie looked at her watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the routine was the same . From Staten Island across the harbor on the ferry , up through the park , past the brick walls that after September 11 were plastered with pictures of missing people , into the heart of lower Manhattan 's financial district , past the cavernous crater where the Twin Towers had stood , to St. Paul 's . The little church was a strangely out-of-place stone chapel with a century-old cemetery just thirty yards from the pit . A chapel that , for months after the attacks , had been a caf , a hospital , a meeting place , a counseling office , a refuge , a haven to firefighters and police officers and rescue workers and volunteers , a place to pray and be prayed for . A place that pointed people to God . All the things a church should be . Never mind the plans for a new World Trade Center , or the city 's designs for an official memorial . Never mind the tourists gathered at the ten-foot chain-link fence around the pit or the throngs gawking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Twin Towers ' inception and creation and place in history . Souvenir picture books might be sold around the perimeter of the pit , but only one place gave people a true taste of what had happened that awful day . St. Paul 's . The ferry docked , and Jamie was one of the first off . When it was raining or snowing she took a cab , but today she walked . Streets in lower Manhattan teemed as they always had , but there was something different about the people . It did n't matter how many years passed , how many anniversaries of the attacks came and went . The people of New York City would never be the same . Yes , they were busy , still driven to climb the ladders or make a name for themselves in New York City . But for the most part they were more likely to make eye contact , and when they did , they were more likely to smile or nod or give some sort of sign that the bond was still there , that a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 11 and not be changed forever . Jamie breathed in hard through her nose and savored the sweet mix of seawater and city air . Jake would 've liked this , the way she was facing the situation , allowing her pain to work for good in the lives of others . She had lived in paralyzing fear for so long , but now-now that she 'd lost Jake-she could face anything . Not in her own strength , but because Jake 's faith lived deep within her . Funny how she 'd come to be a volunteer at St. Paul 's . It was Captain Hisel 's idea . He 'd been Jake 's boss , his mentor . He 'd found Jake-or the man he thought was Jake-in the aftermath of the collapse of the towers . Of course the man had n't been Jake at all but Eric Michaels , a Los Angeles businessman who came into Jamie 's life by mistake . A man she believed was her husband for three agonizing months . A man who 'd gone home to his family three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told only a few people the details of that tender , tragic time . Captain Hisel was one of them . The captain became a special friend in the months and years since the terrorist attacks . At first they shared an occasional Sunday dinner , but since shortly after the first anniversary of the attacks they were together at least twice a week , volunteering at St. Paul 's and sharing lunch or dinner . He was Aaron to her now , and the two of them had everything in common . Or at least it seemed that way . Jamie turned a corner and saw the old cemetery . It was clean now , free of the ash and debris that had gathered around the tombstones and remained there for months after the attacks . The island of Manhattan was a different place since that terrible Tuesday morning , more vulnerable , less cocksure . But warmer too . Stronger . For most of America , time might 've dimmed the horror of what happened to New York City when the Twin Towers fell . But those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents was undeniable . A few feet in front of her , a street vendor nodded . " Nice day . " " Yes , it is . " Jamie smiled and kept walking . See . There it was again . Before September 11 , a vendor would n't have made eye contact unless he wanted to push a hot dog or a bag of caramelized almonds . Now ? Now the man was familiar . She saw him every time she volunteered at St. Paul 's ; he probably knew where she was headed , what she was doing . Everyone in lower Manhattan knew about St. Paul 's . Jamie crossed the street , stopped , and turned-same as she did every day . Before she could enter St. Paul 's Chapel , before she could open her heart to the picture-taking tourists and the quietly grieving regulars who could n't stay away , she had to see for herself that the towers were really gone . It was part of the ritual . She had to look across the street at the grotesque gargantuan hole where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here and what she was doing , that terrorists really had flown airplanes into the World Trade Center and obliterated the buildings-and two thousand lives . Because Jake had been one of those people , coming to St. Paul 's kept him alive in some ways . Being at Ground Zero , helping out ... that was something Jake would 've done . It was the very thing he 'd been doing when he died . Jamie let her gaze wander up into the empty sky , searching unseen floors and windows . Had he been on the way up-he and his best schoolboy buddy , Larry-trying to reach victims at the top ? Or had he been partway down ? She narrowed her eyes . If only God would give her a sign , so she would know exactly where to look . She blinked and the invisible towers faded . Tears welled in her heart , and she closed her eyes . Breathe , Jamie . You can do this . God , help me do this . A deep breath in through her nose . Exhale ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength is sufficient for you , daughter . She often prayed at this stage of the routine , and almost as often she felt God whispering to her , coaxing her , helping her along as a father might help his little girl . The way Jake had helped Sierra . The quiet murmurs in the most hurting part of her soul were enough . Enough to give her strength and desire and determination to move ahead , to go through the doors of St. Paul 's and do her part to keep the vigil for all she lost more than three years ago . She turned her back to the pit and took determined steps beside the black wrought iron fence bordering the cemetery , around the corner to the small courtyard at the front of the chapel . The hallowed feeling always hit her here , on the cobbled steps of the little church . How many firefighters had entered here in the months after the attacks , firemen looking for food or comfort or a shoulder to cry on ? How many had passed through it since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason to grieve the tragedy even if it had never touched them personally ? Just inside the doors , Jamie turned to the left and stopped . There , scattered over a corner table , was a ragtag display of hundreds of items : yellowed photos , keepsakes , and letters written to victims of the attacks . She scanned the table , saving his picture for last . Beneath the photo of a balding man holding a newborn baby , the grin on his face ear to ear : Joe , we 're still waiting for you to come home ... Scribbled atop a wedding photo : You were everything to me , Cecile ; you still are ... Tacked to the side of a wallet-sized picture of a young FDNY guy : Your ladder boys still take the field every now and then but it 's not the same without you . Yesterday Saul hit a homer and every one of us looked up . Are you there ? Every time Jamie did this , her eyes found different letters , different snippets of pain and aching loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same place . At Jake 's picture and the letter written by their daughter , Sierra . Jake was so handsome , his eyes brilliant blue even in the poorly lit corner . Jake ... I 'm here , Jake . When there were n't too many people working their way into the building , she could stand there longer than usual . This was one of those days . Her eyes locked on her husband 's , and for a moment he was there again , standing before her , smiling at her , holding his arms out to her . Her fingers moved toward the picture , brushing the feathery photo paper as if it were Jake 's face , his skin . " Jake ... " For the briefest moment she was sure she could hear him . Jamie , I 'm not gone , I 'm here . Come see for yourself . She drew her hand back and wrapped her arms around her waist . People had caught her touching his picture before ; it made the volunteer coordinators nervous . As if maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far from healed herself . She did n't mean to touch the photo ; it just happened . Something about his eyes in the picture made him seem larger than life , the way he 'd been before ... Before . That was it , was n't it ? Life before September 11 , and life after it . Two completely different lives . There were times when she thought she could hear Jake . His voice still rang in the corridors of her heart , the way it always would . Tears blurred her eyes and she gritted her teeth . She would n't break down here , not now . On his birthday or their anniversary , maybe . On the anniversary of September 11 , of course . But if she was going to keep Jake 's memory alive , she could n't break down every time she volunteered . She glanced at the letter , the one Sierra had written a few weeks ago on the third anniversary of the attack . Her daughter 's other letters were safe in a scrapbook , a keepsake for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared with Jake . Every few months Sierra wrote a new note , and that one would replace the old one on the display table . The letter showed that Sierra still did n't know how her father had died . As far as she knew , her daddy did n't die on September 11 but three months later . In a fire , trying to save people trapped inside . It was a half-truth ; the best Jamie could do under the circumstances . She just had n't known how to tell Sierra that the man who 'd been living with them for three months was n't really her father but a stranger . In the three years since Eric Michaels left them , Jamie had yet to figure out a way to talk about the subject . For that matter , Sierra still had a picture of herself standing next to Eric . Once , a little more than a year ago , Jamie had tried to take it down . She could still see the look on her daughter 's face when she came running down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My picture of me and Daddy is gone ! " Jamie felt awful about that one . She 'd gone up with Sierra and pretended to look for it . That night while her daughter slept , Jamie took it from the closet where she 'd hidden it and placed it on Sierra 's dresser again . Right next to Jake 's fire helmet . Two other times she 'd tried to replace it with other photos , pictures that actually were of Sierra and Jake . " The one after Daddy got hurt is too sad , " she 'd tell Sierra . " Let 's put it away , okay ? " But Sierra would move the other photos to her bookshelves , keeping the one of her and Eric on her dresser . " That 's the last picture of me and Daddy . I want it there forever . Please , Mommy , do n't make me move it . " The memory lifted . Sierra had never even been to St. Paul 's ; she did n't know that 's where her mother volunteered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them was getting harder to stand by . Deception was n't Jamie 's style , and lately she 'd been feeling that one day soon she 'd have to tell Sierra the truth . Her daughter deserved that much . Jamie worked her gaze along her daughter 's neat handwriting and read the letter for the hundredth time . Dear Daddy , how are you doing up in heven ? I 'm doing good down here ; I 'm in second grade , and Mommy says I 'm smartst in my class . But I 'm not that smart cuz I have some things I do n't know . Like how come you had to go to heven when I need you so much rite here ? How come you had to help those peple in that fire ? Why culdnt they wok out by themselfs . Somtimes I clos my eys and I remember how you lookd . Somtimes I remember budrfly kisses . But somtimes I forget . I love you . Sierra . Sometimes she forgets . That was the hardest part of all lately . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God , do n't let either of us forget Jake . He 's with You , still alive somewhere in Paradise with You . But until we can all be together again , help Sierra remember him , God . Please . Help her-Someone tapped her shoulder , and she spun around , her breath in her throat . " Aaron ! " She stepped back from the display table and forced a smile . " Hi . " " Hey . " He backed up toward the wooden pews that filled the center of the chapel . " Someone wants to- " Aaron looked past her at the picture of Jake , as if he 'd only just realized the reason why she was standing there . For a long while he said nothing , then he looked at her , his eyes filled with a familiar depth . " I 'm sorry . I did n't realize you were - " " No , it 's okay . " She slipped her hands in the pockets of her sweater . " I was reading Sierra 's letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aaron bit his lip and let his gaze fall to the floor . " It was bound to happen . " She gave a slight shrug . The corners of her mouth lifted some , but the smile stopped there . " She was only four when he died . " " I know . " A respectful quiet fell between them . " Still hard to believe he 's gone . " " Yes . " Once more she glanced at Jake 's picture . " Still hard to believe . " ( Continues ... )
