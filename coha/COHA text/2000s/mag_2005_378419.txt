Michael Choe believes in homeownership . He bought his first place fresh out of college . Yet these days he 's doing something he never thought he would do again : renting . With a new baby , Choe , 39 , and his wife badly wanted to buy a larger house . But , says Choe , " the market has gone too high too fast . Compared to owning , rent is cheap . " <P> Is he serious ? Choose to rent when owning seems a sure way to riches ? On closer view , he just may be on to something . The Choes sold their tiny ranch in Sacramento , Calif. , for $369,000 , or nearly twice what they had paid three years earlier . But rather than plow his money back into a sky-high market in which people were bandying about the word bubble , Choe rented a bigger house in a better neighborhood  --  at a monthly expense similar to his old mortgage and for less than half of what it would take to buy the new place . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental market . With so many people buying homes in the past few years , landlords in certain frothy markets , like San Diego , Miami , Las Vegas and Washington , have gone begging . Not a few are collecting less in rent than they are paying in mortgage expense . Their bet is that in the end , rising values will make up for their losses . And it may work out for them . But for now their gamble is giving tenants the upper hand . In the San Francisco suburb of Menlo Park , Patrick Killelea , 39 , rents a two-bedroom house for $2,350 a month  --  a 13% cut from the $2,700 he paid when he moved in five years ago . " I asked for a rent reduction , " he says . " Everyone gets a reduction . " <P> Experience and the nation 's million or so real estate agents tell us that in the long run , owning a home makes the most financial sense . But today , with so many rushing to own , the math often works out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jumped since 2000 , the monthly mortgage payment for a median-price house has risen 23% , to $2,079 , according to Torto Wheaton Research . ( That assumes a 30-year fixed rate with 10% down . ) Meanwhile , the average apartment rent has edged lower by $4 , to $1,391 . <P> That tells you two things . First , you should have bought in Boston in 2000 . Second , right now renting there is a comparatively good deal . " It 's important to ask , ' Am I making the right decision to buy today ? ' " says Gleb Nechayev , senior economist at Torto . " The balance has shifted so much in favor of renting , people should pay attention . " <P> Dartmouth professor of real estate John Vogel Jr . did a study of two similar Chicago apartment buildings , a rental and a condo , erected across the street from each other in 2001 . At that time , the rentals were projected to be $1,800 a month , while the condos were expected to sell for $270,000 . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell for $450,000 . " Things have gotten totally out of synch , " Vogel says .
