<p> In brilliant colors that will stun those who remember the era 's black and white images , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is launching the first-ever retrospective of Jacqueline Kennedy 's glamorous style . <p> Forty years after Kennedy 's ascension as Queen of Camelot , the exhibit , which runs from May 1 to July 29 , displays dozens of ensembles worn during John F. Kennedy 's 1960 campaign and at subsequent state functions . <p> But " Jacqueline Kennedy : The White House Years - Selections From the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum , " reveals much more than dresses . The exhibit - the first Costume Institute show mounted in the museum 's expansive main galleries - offers a close-up of Mrs. Kennedy 's style , the influences that shaped her , and her own potency as a trendsetter . <p> " Jacqueline Kennedy is one of history 's great style icons , " says Hamish Bowles , European editor-at-large of " Vogue " and a creative consultant for the show . But he also explores new material on Mrs. Kennedy , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1950s and the dynamism of the ' 60s . <p> " I had n't realized that she was so completely involved in every aspect of her style , her wardrobe , " Bowles said . " Working with her designers , working with her curators , she was so unbelievably hands on . She hired all the right people and then she really , really worked closely with them over even the most minute details . " <p> In his essay in the exhibit 's catalog , presidential historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr . recalls , " Jacqueline Kennedy 's chosen medium of communication was the memorandum on a legal pad , scrawled upon in the looping society handwriting she had learned at Miss Porter 's . <p> " She fired off memos every morning , rather in the manner of the ' Action This Day ' memos with which Winston Churchill used to torment generals , admirals and cabinet ministers during the Second World War . " <p> Through memos ( some accompanied by playful sketches ) , notes and speeches ( several written by Mrs. Kennedy in Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics behind her transformation of the White House into a symbol of cultural power . <p> " She was a voracious reader of history and we have a wish list that she composed of the historically significant items she wanted for the White House , " Bowles says . " Then she went through storerooms and attics and literally found things that had been languishing through previous administrations , and had those restored and put into place . She went on to appoint and work closely with the first curator that the White House ever had . " <p> The first lady had a strong sense of history , daughter Caroline Kennedy writes . <p> " Like President Kennedy , she believed that American civilization had come of age , " Caroline Kennedy writes in the catalog . " Together , they transformed the White House into an international stage celebrating American arts and letters , and encouraged Americans to take pride in our artistic as well as political heritage . " <p> The show also hints at the sense of humor behind the first lady 's serious image . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House dressing room feature a collection of some of those things most dear : a picture of herself with her father ; a little painting of daisies from her sister , Lee . She included herself as a rather large fly on the wall . <p> The clothes , with their eye-popping colors and drop-dead fabrics , include Kennedy 's trademark fawn coat and pillbox hat . There is the regal ivory satin gown she chose for inaugural festivities ; the bright red dress from her Feb. 14 , 1962 , televised tour of the White House ; the beaded number that dazzled Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1961 ; and the Oleg Cassini confection of pink and white straw lace she wore to the Elysee Palace in Paris . <p> " I think knocking the chichi out of Paris and making it more American was really her style , " Bowles says . " Simplifying and exaggerating and purifying certain elements like the three-quarter sleeve , the dramatic colors and buttons , the stand-alone collar , then focusing on the totality of a look . It was very thought-out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a euphoric photo mural of the Kennedys in a New York City ticker-tape parade as a backdrop . <p> It works its way through the inaugural festivities of Jan. 19 and 20 , 1961 , featuring stunning pieces like the Oleg Cassini gown she wore to one gala where Laurence Olivier , Ella Fitzgerald , Mahalia Jackson and Frank Sinatra performed . <p> Next are her state visits to Canada and Europe , to India , Pakistan and Latin America . <p> " The colors are extraordinary because so much of this information has come to us through black and white images . I think she understood very clearly that she needed to be immediately recognizable and identifiable in a crowd , particularly on state visits , " Bowles says . <p> " You really see how sensitive she was to the countries she was visiting . In India , the coat that she wore off the plane in New Delhi is sort of an abbreviation of a Nehru jacket , " Bowles says , strolling past ensembles in hot pink and brilliant blue . <p> " The colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solids means that , when you see pictures of her surrounded by all these incredible patterned saris , she stills stands out . " <p> In Mexico , she stayed with deep pastels like spring yellows and softer pinks and blues , while in France she wore clothes by French designers . <p> The typed transcript of a speech John F. Kennedy was supposed to present at a press club luncheon in Paris , shows the president scratched out the opening paragraph and wrote along the side : " I 'm the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris . " <p> The next gallery concentrates on the White House restoration , a monumental undertaking begun during Kennedy 's first days in the White House and completed in only three years . <p> " Her major project as first lady was to transform the White House into an appropriate setting for the presidency , to bring back all these historically resonant objects and furnishings , " Bowles says . <p> Diagrams lay out details as minute as the colored threads in curtain tassels . A video screen shows her famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alongside the dress she wore for the televised program and the script she used , with her handwritten notations . <p> The exhibit then moves to day and cocktail clothing , followed by gala evening gowns and seating charts made by Jackie Kennedy for state dinners . <p> A photo mural of the seating chart for a White House dinner in honor of Andre Malraux features a who 's who of American arts and letters - including Tennessee Williams , Arthur Miller , George Balanchine , Irwin Shaw , Robert Lowell and Mark Rothko - as a backdrop for dress after elegant dress . <p> " Toward the end one sees an evolution in terms of the evening looks , " Bowles notes . " They started out fairly austere and they became a little bit more romantic toward the end , but what you really see overall is this incredibly unified vision of how she wanted to present herself . " <p> It is fitting that the first retrospective of Jacqueline Kennedy 's style is being mounted by the Met . Mrs. Kennedy , who settled in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis , was a longtime patron of the museum . <p> She lived across the street , at 1040 Fifth Avenue , and her close friend and fashion adviser Diana Vreeland , a former Vogue editor , was a consultant for the Costume Institute . It was Mrs. Kennedy who selected the Egyptian temple of Dendur , now housed at the museum , to be saved from the rising waters of the Aswan Dam . She died of cancer in 1994 . <p> After New York , the exhibit , organized in collaboration with the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum , will travel to Boston . It will be on view there from Sept. 12 , 2001 through Feb. 28 , 2002 . <p> On the Net : <p> Metropolitan Museum of Art : http : //www.metmuseum.org <p> John F.
