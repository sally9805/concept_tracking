You may think the term granny grabber refers to an unsavory frequenter of shopping malls . But in the garment industry , it evokes one of the most heartwarming and affirming human interactions : diminutive overalls and dresses that prove so downright adorable that grandparents ca n't resist buying them as gifts . Thanks in part to the granny-grabber factor , children 's clothes have been a consistent bright spot in an otherwise rocky retail environment . " The children 's market has bucked the trend , " says Marshal Cohen , co-president of the market-research firm NPDFashionworld . " It 's the only apparel sector that grew in 2002 . " <P> And the trend is continuing . According to NPD , in 2002 sales of children 's apparel rose 6% . During the same period , sales of apparel in general fell 1.7% . The teen market , a fickle but vastly rewarding category for retailers who can crack it , was flat . And kids ' apparel  --  for newborns through about age 10  --  grew even as the birthrate slightly but steadily declined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of adults ' clothing . Children constantly outgrow things , whereas adults can more easily defer clothing purchases , especially in hard times . But this does n't fully explain today 's persistent increase in kids ' apparel sales . For that , one has to look at shifts in demographics , marketing and the national mood . <P> War and terrorism have created a desire among many parents to protect and pamper their children , says Erin Clack , market editor of the trade publication Children 's Business . Clack says many parents tell her they want to indulge their children by buying them unique and beautiful things . This trend has been a boon to independent specialty stores like the Kangaroo Pouch in Atlanta . Owner Eloise Morris says customers seem particularly drawn to personalized items , like monogrammed hair bows and bibs . <P> Morris reports that while clothing for all children 's age groups is doing well at the Kangaroo Pouch , layette items are best sellers , a trend that holds up at other retailers . In fact , Clack says apparel for newborns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's category . <P> Which brings us to demographics . Today the percentage of babies being born to women in their 30s is higher than it has ever been . In 2001 the birthrate for women ages 30 to 34 was 14% higher than it had been in 1990 ; the birthrate for women ages 35 to 39 was 28% higher . Women have larger salaries in their 30s than in their 20s , the age at which most women had children in years past . Women today are also more likely to be in dual-income marriages , which provide even more disposable income . <P> Cheryl Kilton , 40 , a pharmaceutical sales representative in Omaha , Neb. , has a 2-year-old daughter and says many of her friends have also had children later in life . " We have great jobs , own a home and have no debt , " says Kilton , who spent $200 on a Christmas dress trimmed in mink with matching fur shoe clips and headband for her daughter , who wore the outfit once before it was tucked away in a cedar chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
