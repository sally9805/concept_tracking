London , 1818 Women . Nairn O'Banyon loved them with every inch of his being . He loved the look and feel and sound and taste of them . Loved the way they thought and laughed and glanced at him from the corners of their long-lashed eyes . Two were watching him even now . He could feel them peruse him from behind . Could sense their interest and so much more . One was young . One was middle-aged . They were both lovely , regardless how they looked . " Sir O'Banyon , is n't it ? " called the older of the two . He turned at the sound of his name and was not disappointed . The sweet , heady scent of them tickled his nostrils . " Aye , me lady , " he said and bowed . The tail of his brown cutaway coat brushed his boot tops , and the ivory buttons on his fawn-colored waistcoat gleamed . ' T was a silly costume . ' T would be no good a'tall in the heat of battle , yet the snug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage , and did no small favor to some of his other attributes . And though the hilt of his ancient blade caused a slight rumple in the fabric at the small of his back , he was forever loath to set it aside , for in his experience , there was no friend so trusted as the dagger he called MacGill . The women approached , pastel gowns rustling againstthe cobbled walk , frilled parasols tilted just so . He filled his senses with them . Through the dark years behind him , ladies ' costumes had changed , but the essence of a woman had not . ' T was one of several things for which he would be eternally grateful . " Mrs. Murray , " he said , and reaching for the older woman 's hand , kissed her knuckles . The titillation of skin against skin caused a prickle of sensation to quiver across the back of his neck . Cecilia Murray gave him a flirting smile . " We missed you at Lord Bayberry 's ball yesterday eve , sir . " Her gown was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show every swell from toe to bosom , where it gathered lovingly to display a wealth of dove-white breast . Feelings sharpened , scraping like fingernails down his spine . O'Banyon drew his hand cautiously away . " Then I must surely be absent more oft , " he said , " if I be missed by such a bonny lass as yerself . " " Lass ? " she said and laughed huskily but her cheeks flushed and her eyes shone . " You , sir , are a terrible tease . " " Na a'tall , " he said and held her gaze , " I am but an Irishman . And we take lovely lassies verra serious , indeed . " Her hand fluttered to her bosom . His gaze followed it . His senses sharpened , his nostrils flared , and for a moment he feared he had gone a bit far , but in that instant the younger woman stepped forward , distracting him . " Sir , " she said , extending her hand , " ' t is such a pleasure to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned you on more than one occasion . " There was little he could do but take her hand . Anything less would have been considered rude . And he was never rude . . . not where women were involved . Her fingers felt soft against his palm . Her scent was sweet and heady . His body tightened another notch . " Then ye have me at a disadvantage , lass , " he said and kissed her knuckles . Sensations crowded in , feelings as sharp as knives . Images of pale skin , succulent bosoms , long limbs tangled , hot and sweaty , about his . The bed in his rented townhouse was surely large enough for three . But there were problems . . . Releasing her hand , he stepped back a pace and put the thoughts behind him  --  where they tingled along his backside like a wanton caress . " A disadvantage ? " she asked . " Aye . For I dunna ken if I should deny yer aunt 's words aboot me or swear they be true . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you were the most alluring man in all of London . " " Did she now ? " She held his gaze with bold tenacity . " She did indeed . " " Aye well , " he said and turned toward the aunt . " It seems the truth will out then , little matter how I try to hide it . " The widow laughed low in her throat . O'Banyon tightened his defenses against the rousing effects . " She also informed me that you were quite vain , " said the girl . Her tone was cool , as if impatient at his lack of attention . He turned slowly back toward her with feral slowness . Their gazes met . Her eyes widened the slightest degree , and her breath seemed to stop in her fragile , white throat . " I can but apologize for me shortcomings , lass , " he said . " Have you many then ? " she murmured . " Counted with the stars , " he assured her . " Truly . " She stepped forward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that ye might confess  --  " " Rosanna , " said Mrs. Murray , her tone just a tad sharper than it had been only moments before . " I believe a breeze is picking up . Will you be a dear and fetch my shawl from the curricle ? " The girl hesitated just a moment , then pulled her gaze from O'Banyon 's and crafted a careful smile . " But auntie , the carriage is halfway across town . " The women 's gazes met steadily . " I know , my dearest , and I do so apologize , but if I catch a chill I fear your visit may very well be cut short and you 'll be forced to return prematurely to your mother in Worcester . " Temper darkened the girl 's eyes , which were met by her aunt 's knowing stare . Then Rosanna nodded sharply and turned toward O'Banyon . " Another time , sir , " she said . He bowed and watched her go . " My niece will be visiting her cousins this afternoon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps you could come round for tea . " O'Banyon grinned , well flattered . " I fear I dunna drink tea , lass . " " In truth , sir , neither do I. " He gripped his hands behind his back . " Did I na hear ye are betrothed to another ? " Continues ...
