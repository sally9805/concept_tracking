15 fast fixes to turn around unhealthy habits <p> Beneath the veneer of every health- conscious woman lurk a few nasty habits . After all , nobody 's perfect . And though you ca n't pop a pill for every peccadillo , there are some adjustments  --  right in plain sight in the vitamin aisle  --  that can minimize the impact of your dirty little secrets . Of course , they 're not permanent solutions , and you know it : Good health can come only from eating most of the right foods , most of the time . But everyone wants to be nutritionally naughty now and then , and we 've got just the Band-Aids to cover up your boo-boos . <p> TRUE CONFESSION You buy green vegetables all the time . You just do n't eat them <p> Turns out that skipping salad is a relatively minor offense ( unless cancer is your concern ; see " Cancerproof Your Life , " p. 170 ) . Greens provide valuable fiber and folate , but so do other vegetables , fruits , and grains ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , nutrition experts say , is that you might be missing out on vitamins A and K. But true deficiencies are relatively rare , and as long as you eat plenty of other fruits and vegetables , particularly carrots , cantaloupe , apricots , mangoes , and lettuce , and even canned vegetable soup , you 're assured of getting these necessary nutrients . <p> FAST FIX Take a multivitamin and eat plenty of the veggies you do like . Make sure the multi provides vitamin A ( 700 mcg per day ) , B6 ( at least 1.3 mg per day ) , and B12 ( 2.4 mcg per day ) . <p> TRUE CONFESSION Okay , you hate all vegetables <p> Closet vegetable haters are feeling guiltier than ever now that federal dietary guidelines recommend nine servings of produce a day , up from five . Well , you 're far from alone Michigan State University researchers report that 77% of us never even get to five . And making up the difference with fruit has n't been nearly as much fun since those high-protein killjoys came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bottle . " We know that vegetables provide literally thousands of phytonutrients , " says Jeffrey B. Blumberg , PhD , director of the antioxidants research laboratory at Tufts University . " No one has discovered a way to put them all into a supplement . " Veggie haters are also likely depriving themselves of much-needed fiber . Between ages 19 and 50 , women should eat 25 g of dietary fiber each day ; after age 50 , it 's 21 g , says Joanne Lupton , PhD , a nutritionist at Texas A &M; University who worked on the federal fiber guidelines . Yet most women get only half that . <p> FAST FIX Make use of fiber supplements and definitely take a multi . Fake fiber is better than no fiber . A serving of a typical fiber supplement provides about 4 g . " Supplements are not dangerous and they can be helpful in maintaining regularity , " Lupton says . Just make sure to follow the directions to drink enough water . But give yourself a deadline for finding some vegetables you 'll actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the medicine cabinet , where they belong . ( For ideas , check out " Love the Vegetables You Hate " at **30;2115;TOOLONG . ) And do n't forget that multivitamin : It 's nowhere near as healthful as eating fruits and vegetables , but it will help prevent chronic diseases . ( Because fiber can affect mineral absorption , take your multi at a different time of day , ) <p> TRUE CONFESSION You never lift weights <p> Could " bone-jarring " exercise ever be a good thing ? Well , yes : Weight-bearing exercise  --  something more vigorous than your morning stroll  --  fends off osteoporosis . And most of us are savvy enough to know that calcium is also critical . But it turns out that making sure you get adequate vitamin D is even more important than nutritionists once thought , because it 's crucial to calcium absorption . We get vitamin D from sun exposure and food , and there 's no chance of taking in too much from these natural sources . But supplements can be toxic , and at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Researchers at Harvard 's School of Public Health earlier this year reported that daily doses of 700 to 800 IU of vitamin D reduced the risk of hip fracture by 26% in older women  --  more than calcium or a placebo . Yet current recommendations call for just 200 IU of vitamin D for young adults , 4001U for women ages 51 to 70 , and 600 IU for those 71 and older . <p> FAST FIX Up your vitamin D  --  judiciously . The experts are currently duking it out over the optimal levels , says Blumberg , because the RDAs appear to be too low ; many nutritionists now recommend 800 IU per day . For the time being , make sure you 're getting at least what 's suggested for your age group , and do n't worry about going somewhat higher . The tolerable upper limit , according to dietary guidelines , is 2,000 IU per day . ( The University of Massachusetts just reported that a diet that provides 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D might prevent PMS . ) Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet should include 90 mcg per day , entirely from food sources ( K is bountiful in broccoli , cauliflower , brussels sprouts , and leafy greens ) . <p> TRUE CONFESSION Actually , you do n't exercise as much as you should , period <p> You know all the good things exercise can do for your heart , blood pressure , weight , and mood . So far , no one has invented the gym in pill form . But adding a daily dose of vitamin E , an antioxidant , will provide some of the same protection that exercise does from unstable molecules called free radicals . ( Free radicals can harm cells , tissues , and organs and are believed to be one of the causes of the degenerative processes seen in aging . ) A study at the University of Florida 's College of Nursing found that although exercise and vitamin E offer the best protection from oxidative stress  --  the damage caused by free radicals  --  vitamin E on its own was better than nothing . <p> FAST FIX Add vitamin E. " I recommend 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an associate professor of nursing and author of the study . ( The current vitamin E RDA for women is 15 mg per day , or 22.5 IU ; the safe upper limit is 1,000 mg , or 1,500 IU . ) <p> TRUE CONFESSION No , you do n't got milk <p> If you do n't like dairy , who cares ? Calcium is a great example of a supplement that 's practically as helpful as the actual food source , says Lupton . As long as you 're taking 1,000 to 1,200 mg of calcium each day  --  more than the amount in most multivitamins  --  you 're banking enough calcium in your bones to help stave off osteoporosis later . <p> FAST FIX Give your calcium supplements a checkup . For now , it may make sense to rely on pills rather than " calcium-added " products . A new study from Creighton University found that the bioavailability of the calcium contained in fortified foods , such as orange juice , varied widely , with no way for consumers to tell how much calcium they would absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riboflavin , says Janelle Walter , PhD , a nutritionist at Baylor University , so if you do n't do dairy , make sure you 're getting 1.1 mg per day from other foods , such as lean meats , eggs , or almonds , or your multivitamin . ( And to keep your bones healthy , make sure you get adequate amounts of vitamins D and K. ) <p> TRUE CONFESSION You 've been pumping up the volume since your teens <p> Nutrition can play a role in preventing permanent hearing loss , says Kathleen Campbell , PhD , director of audiology research at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine . A diet rich in selenium and vitamins A , C , and E has been shown to protect rats and guinea pigs from hearing loss and to lessen the damage caused by loud noises . Additional animal research is probing the potential of magnesium supplements , resveratrol ( that 's the good stuff found in grapes , red wine , and berries ) , and an element of protein found in cheese and yogurt , although it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on men has found that magnesium not only prevents heating damage but it also mitigates damage when given within 2 hours of sudden hearing loss  --  from an infection , say , or an extremely loud concert . <p> FAST FIX Add some magnesium and selenium . You can find them in fish and nuts . No research supports that taking supplements prevents or reverses noise-induced heating loss , but it makes sense to ensure that you 're getting all the magnesium ( the RDA is 320 mg per day for women ) and selenium ( 55 mcg a day ) you need , in addition to your full allotment of vitamins A , C , and E. <p> TRUE CONFESSION You and Jim Beam are on a first-name basis <p> Occasional overindulgence does n't " deplete vitamin stores in any but the most temporary way , " says Blumberg . However , researchers have linked regular drinking ( consumption of more than 30 g of alcohol a day , about as much as in two drinks ) with elevated levels of homocysteine , an amino acid that contributes to heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the risk of some cancers . <p> FAST FIX Beef up your Bs . You can ward off potential pitfalls on your way to Margaritaville by making sure that you 're getting enough folate ( 400 mcg a day ) , B6 ( younger women need 1.3 mg per day ; those over 50 , 1.5 mg ) , and B12 ( 2.4 mcg a day ) , which reduce homocysteine levels . It 's also smart for party animals to get plenty of antioxidants , including vitamins C ( at least 75 mg a day ) and E ( a bare minimum is 22.5 IU per day . ) <p> TRUE CONFESSION That 's not bronzer  --  you sat in the sun all last weekend <p> The perils of all your furtive tanning efforts are obvious ( you look as leathery as Crocodile Dundee ) and sinister , because you already know that sun exposure puts you at a much higher risk of skin cancer , including deadly melanoma . <p> FAST FIX Down an antioxidant cocktail . A diet rich in vitamins C , E , and A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human epidemiological research , to reduce the incidence of basal cell carcinoma , researchers reported at a recent meeting of the American Academy of Dermatologists . And a French study recently found that when 25 volunteers took daily doses of various antioxidants  --  lycopene , vitamin E , selenium , and beta carotene  --  for 7 weeks , they were less likely to get sunburned . <p> TRUE CONFESSION You occasionally brake for Big Macs . <p> We 're still waiting for a pill that can counter a high-fat food binge . Niacin , in the B-vitamin family , does help lower cholesterol says Blumberg . However , to be effective , it needs to be taken in large doses  --  which means side effects  --  so it 's usually prescribed by your doctor along with statin drugs . But fiber can help . Women with consistent high-fiber diets have been shown to have a significantly lower risk of heart disease , as well as a lower risk of obesity . <p> FAST FIX Order a side of fiber . McDonald 's salads , though not as tasty as those fries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideally , fiber should come from a variety of food sources , says Joanne Slavin , PhD , a professor of nutrition at the University of Minnesota , but following your next trip to Taco Bell with a Metamucil chaser is an acceptable substitute , as long as you remember that it 's a nutritional crutch , not a calorie eraser  --  as popular myths would have you believe . <p> TRUE CONFESSION . and you spend too much at Starbucks and the soda machine <p> Moderate caffeine intake is fine , and the national average  --  280 mg of caffeine per day ( what you 'd get from two 12-ounce cups of coffee )  --  wo n't hurt . But besides causing you to bark at your coworkers , 9 cups of coffee or more a day is linked to high levels of homocysteine , which raises heart risk . Nine cups may sound impossible , but true caffeine fiends wo n't think so : A cup is 8 ounces , so a 20-ounce Starbucks Venti counts as 2 1/2 cups ; most take-out cups are 12 ounces . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caffeine per 12-ounce can . <p> FAST FIX Boost folate and B vitamins . If you ca n't bear to cut back on your daily java , getting adequate amounts of folate , B6 , and B12 will reduce homocysteine levels , reports a Tufts University study . <p> TRUE CONFESSION You do n't have a headache . Your libido has been on vacation <p> For him , there 's always Viagra ( that 's vitamin V to its fans ) . But if you 're the one with limping lust , maybe you should try vitamin C. A German study found that boosting intake of ascorbic acid prompted some participants to have sex more frequently than they usually did over a 14-day period . Perhaps not coincidentally , they also reported being in a far better mood . <p> FAST FIX Experiment with vitamin C. Though study participants took an ultrahigh dose of 3,000 mg , there 's no harm in starting with the current recommendation of 75 mg a day for women to see if it gets your motor running . And feel free to experiment , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up " bowel tolerance . " ( Some people find that high doses of C give them diarrhea . ) Though the safe upper limit has been set at 2,000 mg per day , " there 's no serious threat of toxicity with vitamin C beyond that level , " he says . " The limit was set because of the risk of loose stools , which could also affect your libido . " <p> TRUE CONFESSION Sleep  --  who needs it ? <p> If you routinely get less than 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night  --  either on purpose or because you toss and turn  --  your immune system is paying the price . <p> FAST FIX That multivitamin you 're taking is your immune system 's best friend . And if you 're looking for an antidote to afternoon drowsiness , use caution : Supplements such as ginseng and ginkgo promise to boost mental alertness , but they can interfere with quality sleep at night . To feel more alert , nutritionists point to two basics  --  eat breakfast and drink plenty of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run yourself ragged <p> Not eating right , avoiding the gym , skimping on sleep . Most women have crunch times that cause body abuse . <p> FAST FIX Think zinc . A number of vitamins and minerals can help our immune systems function optimally , says Blumberg , including zinc and vitamins E , C , and B6 . Check that your multivitamin has 8 mg of zinc . Note that zinc is easy to get from high-protein foods , such as lamb , pork , and the dark meat of turkey ; it can also be toxic , so do n't exceed 40 mg per day . <p> TRUE CONFESSIONS Smoke gets in your eyes <p> Everyone knows that hanging out with smokers  --  whether it 's fun at the local bar or misery with your redneck relations  --  makes your hair stink and your lungs hurt . And research long ago demonstrated that smokers ( even those " nonsmokers " who ca n't resist a social smoke now and again ) need more vitamin C than most . Now , it turns out , so do secondhand " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the basic RDA of 75 mg may apply to most women , smokers need at least 95 mg a day . That goes for you , too . <p> TRUE CONFESSION None  --  you 're perfect <p> Pride goeth before a fall . No matter how nutritionally vain you are , chances are good that in any given week , you 've fallen down on your blueberry , bok choy , or bean curd consumption . <p> FAST FIX Take a multivitamin anyway . Nutrition researchers have linked vitamin use to all kinds of healthy outcomes for women , including a decline in birth defects , lower miscarriage rates , and less heart disease , and the American Medical Association recommends that all Americans take a daily supplement . So keep bragging to your friends , but add a multivitamin to your routine . You can work it in between flossing and sit-ups . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Sarah Mahoney <p> <p> Sarah Mahoney is a Prevention contributing editor based in Maine . <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
