<p> The thought of braving the January cold and elements to get to the gym for a morning workout makes you want to hit the snooze button and say , " Forget it . " It 's easy to forgo a bike ride , a jog or even an indoor swim on dark winter days when curling up with a blanket by the fire is much more appealing . <p> Unless you 're someone like Lynne Halpern . <p> The Buckhead jewelry store owner has no such excuses for not working out . Her gym trek is a short trip to the lower level of her house , where an array of equipment makes staying in shape a year-round activity . <p> Halpern and her husband , Jack , work out about five times a week , sometimes with a personal trainer , using their treadmill , Stairmaster , thigh machine and free weights . They 've assembled their gym over the course of several years , since Halpern injured her knee in a skiing accident . <p> " I went to rehab for that and finally decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed the equipment in my house , " said Halpern . " We use it ; my kids use it . Having it means I ca n't say , ' Oh , it 's too cold or I do n't want to leave home . ' " <p> The Halperns are part of a mushrooming group of fitness fans who opt to get their workouts at home . According to trends studied by the Florida-based Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association , 33 percent of all U.S. households own and use exercise equipment . Sales of exercise machines for home use have climbed steadily from about $1.6 billion in 1990 to about $5.5 billion in 2002 . That same year , the best-selling home equipment pieces were treadmills ( $1.4 billion ) ; stationary bikes ( $300 million ) ; and free weights ( $250 million ) , said Mike May , SGMA director of communications <p> At no time of the year are sales stronger than in December and January , when the combination of holiday buying and New Year 's resolutions inspire buyers to bring home a treadmill or stationary bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into shape , " said Phil Verstraete , a former trainer who now works as the regional sales manager for the Virginia-based Fitness Resource , a company that retails exercise equipment . " Now , people over 40 are hearing from their doctors how important it is to stay in shape and keep their joints healthy . " That can easily be done at home with just a few pieces of basic equipment , said Verstraete , starting with the industry 's No. 1 seller : the treadmill . Prices for the machine can vary from just a few hundred dollars at Play It Again Sports , a store that sells new and used equipment , to a $5,000 for a state-of-the-art system with digital controls that mark your progress to the top of the Statue of Liberty , the Washington Monument and other landmarks . <p> " Treadmills are the easiest pieces of equipment to use , " said Steve Uria , founder of the Eclipse One-on-One workout gym in Buckhead . " But the elliptical machines are the latest craze because they have the least impact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another feature key to a good piece of home gym equipment : They can be used by a range of ages and by users with different levels of ability . <p> " If you can walk , you can use a treadmill , so you 're basically qualified by the time you reach kindergarten , " said May . " But they appeal not only to walkers ; runners and joggers like them , too . Ellipticals combine the leg motions of a bike with the back-and-forth pull of ski poles to keep arms and legs in motion . They 're also easier on the knees than a step or stair machine . " <p> " Ellipticals have only been around for six years , but they 're sold more quickly than treadmills , " said Verstraete . " People love them because they use a greater variety of muscles in the upper and lower body , which gives the perception of lower exertion . " <p> Like treadmills , the price tag for ellipticals varies by the number of bells and whistles on the piece . At Play It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used elliptical ; new ones start at about $1,000 . Sales of stationary bikes , though strong , have taken a backseat to recumbent bikes in recent years . Popular for being easier on the back muscles , recumbent bike sales shot up 50 percent between 1998 and 2002 . Spinning bikes have also gained a following among folks who find the action closest to that of an outdoor road bike . Again , prices vary widely , from $100 for a used bike up to $2,000 for a new one . <p> Stationary bikes " are a no-impact activity , and you do n't have to know how to ride a bike to use them , " said May . " They can be used by a 6-year-old as well as 96-year-old . " <p> But fitness experts agree that the great cardio workout offered by these machines is just one part of an overall exercise regime . Strength training has become the latest craze , particularly among baby boomers who are fighting the battle against the aging process . <p> " Cardio exercise does burn calories , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , you have to do the resistance training . Lean muscle mass burns more calories throughout the day and also strengthens joints and prevents osteoporosis . A $50 set of 2- to 3-pound dumbbells can do it . " <p> For those doing power presses , one of the newest gizmos is a weight bar with an electronic sensor . As soon as one hand leaves the electronic sensor panel in the bar , the cable holding the bar locks into place . A bench with a set of weights and the electronic sensor bar runs $3,299 at Fitness Resource . Free weights are sold for 59 cents a pound . At Play It Again Sports , a complete set of used weights sells from $500 to $700 ; new ones are closer to $1,500 . <p> If the price of purchasing home gym equipment seems out of your budget , experts suggest comparing the cost with what you 'd pay for a gym membership . Add to that cost the convenience of having home equipment available 24/7 , as well as a few other perks . <p> " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When you 're at home , you 're in control of who 's on what . Also , at home you can pick the environment  --  the music , the TV show to watch . And some people , particularly those just starting out , are often put off by having to interact with others in Spandex . " <p> Getting into shape does n't have to break the family budget , said Uria , who lists an adjustable bunch , a set of dumbbells , a treadmill and a recumbent bike as his top home-gym pieces . <p> " By being creative , you can get a home gym for under $100 , " he said . " A trampoline can provide a cardio workout . Some light free weights and a weight bar with a foam cover are also good . A simple jump rope is not only cost-effective , it 's mobile . And you can take resistance bands in different thicknesses to the beach or a hotel room to do curls .

" No matter what they pick to get in shape , " he said , " I always add a big admonition to eat better .

Personal trainer Steve Uria suggests that if that option is not available , consider hiring a trainer for one or two sessions to put together a complete home workout using your equipment .
