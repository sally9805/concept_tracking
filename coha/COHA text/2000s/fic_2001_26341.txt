Chapter One Footsteps on the Stair I 'm not sure how to begin this story . For one thing , it 's still going on . For another , you should never tell a story unless you 're sure how it 's going to end . At least that 's what my sixth-grade teacher , Ms. Shabbas , says . And I 'm not sure at all . I 'm not sure that I even know the beginning . I 'm not sure if I 'm a minor character or the heroine . Heck , I 'm not even sure I 'll be around to tell the end of it . But I do n't think anyone else is going to tell this story . Wait ! What was that noise ? I listen for the footsteps on the stairs , footsteps much heavier than those an elderly man should make . But it 's quiet , just the usual spooky nighttime creaking of this old house . I do n't hear anyone coming now . If I do n't survive , maybe they 'll all realize I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Warn the world . That 's pretty melodramatic , is n't it ? But that is one of the things I do well , melodrama . At least that is what Ms. Shabbas says . Her name is Maureen Shabbas . But Ms. Showbiz is what we all call her , because her main motive for living seems to be torturing our class with old Broadway show tunes . She starts every day by singing a few bars of one and then making it the theme for the day . It is so disgustingly awful that we all sort of like it . Imagine someone who loves to imitate Yul Brynner in The King and I , a woman with an Afro , no less , getting up and singing " Shall We Dance ? " in front of a classroom of appalled adolescents . Ms. Showbiz . And she has the nerve to call me melodramatic ! But I guess I am . Maybe this whole thing is a product of my overactiveimagination . If that turns out to be so , all I can say is who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of stories I used to hear from Mom and Dad ? Dad had the best stories . They were ones his aunties told him when he was growing up on the Mohawk Reserve of Akwesasne on the Canadian side . One of my favorites was the one about the skeleton monster . He was just a human being at first , a lazy , greedy uncle who hung around the longhouse and let everyone else hunt for him . One day , alone in the lodge , waiting for the others to come home with food , Lazy Uncle burned his finger really badly in the fire and stuck it into his mouth to cool it . " Oooh , " he said as he sucked the cooked flesh , " this tastes good ! " ( Is n't that gross ? I love it . At least , I used to love it . ) It tasted so good , in fact , that he ate all the flesh off his finger . " Ah , " he said , " this is an easy way to get food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked another finger , and another , until he had eaten all his fingers . " Oooh , " he said , " that was good , but I am still hungry . " So he cooked his toes and ate them . He cooked his feet and ate them . He cooked his legs and ate them . He cooked his right arm and then his left . He kept on until he had cooked his whole body and eaten it , and all that was left was a skeleton . When he moved , his bones rubbed together : **35;0;TOOLONG . " Ah , " he said in a voice that was now just a dry whisper . " That was good , but I am still hungry . I hope that my relatives come home soon . " And when his relatives came home , one by one , they found that the lodge was dark except for the glow of the cooking fire . They could see a shadowy shape beckoning to them from the other side of the fire . They could hear a sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Skeleton Man whispered . " I have been waiting for you . " One by one all of his relatives came into the lodge . Skeleton Man caught them and ate them , all but one . She was his niece , and she had been playing in her favorite spot down by the river that flowed through the gorge . She was late coming home because she had seen a rabbit that had fallen into the river . She had rescued it from drowning and warmed it in her arms until it was able to run away . When the little girl came to the lodge , she was surprised at how quiet it was . She should have heard people talking and laughing , but she did n't hear anything . Something was wrong . Slowly , carefully , she approached the door of the lodge . A strange sound came from the shadows within : **35;74;TOOLONG . Then a dry voice called out to her . " My niece , " Skeleton Man whispered . " Come into the lodge . I have been waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are my parents ? " she asked . " They are here . They are here inside , " Skeleton Man whispered . " Come in and be with them . " " No , " the girl said , " I will not come inside . " " Ah , " Skeleton Man replied in his dry , thin voice , " that is all right . I will come out for you . " Then Lazy Uncle , the Skeleton Man , walked out of the lodge . His dry bones rubbed together as he walked toward the little girl : **35;111;TOOLONG . The girl began to run , not sure where to go . Skeleton Man would have caught her and eaten her if it had n't been for that rabbit she 'd rescued from the river . It appeared on the path before her . " I will help you because you saved me , " said the rabbit . " Follow me . " Then the rabbit helped the little girl outwit Skeleton Man . It even showed her how to bring everyone Skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad told me stories like that all the time . Before they vanished . Disappeared . Gone , just like that . I was on TV when they disappeared . You probably saw me on Unsolved Mysteries . The news reporter said into her microphone , " Child left alone in house for over three days , terrified , existing on cornflakes and canned food . " Actually I went to school on Tuesday and called out for pizza once . Mom had left money on her dresser when they went out that Saturday evening and never returned .
