The phone call that summoned us to D.C. came on a Friday evening in April . I was busy playing Frisbee with some pizza dough and Lauren was slicing garlic so thin it was translucent . Her hands were less sticky than mine were so she answered the phone . A moment later , with real surprise in her tone , she said , " Hi , A. J. No , no , no . You 're not interrupting anything . Really . We 're just throwing some dinner together .... Yes , in our new kitchen , it 's wonderful . It 's good to hear from you .... We 're doing fine , thanks . You ? " I smiled . The only A. J. I knew was A. J. Simes , a retired FBI psychologist . The previous year she had been instrumental in helping me identify and track down someone who was eager to kill me . Before the adventure was over she had saved my life . Lauren and I had only heard from her once since she had left Colorado and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with Milt Custer , A. J. ? " Lauren asked . Milt was also retired FBI , and had been A. J. 's colleague the previous fall . A. J. 's response to the Milt Custer inquiry took a while . Milt , a Chicago widower , had been sweet on A. J. during their sojourn together in Colorado . I fondly recalled his awkward flirting . But Lauren 's next words yanked me back to the present . " You want our help with something ? ... Both of us ? ... Of course I 'll listen . Should Alan get on an extension ? Good , yes ... Hold on . " Lauren covered the mouthpiece and said , " It 's A. J. Simes . She wants our help with something . Why do n't you get on the cordless and listen into what she has to say ? " I grabbed the other phone from the front hallway and A. J. and I greeted each other . Immediately after the pleasantries she asked , " Have either of you ever heard of a man named Edmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the name was familiar . " Well , have you ever heard of an organization called Locard ? It is , of course , named after Edmond Locard . He , by the way , was a nineteenth-century French police detective . " We both said no , though Lauren had begun nodding her head as though she was remembering something about him . A. J. sighed . " Does the name Vidocq ring any bells ? An organization called the Vidocq Society ? " " Yes , " I replied . " I 've read something about them . It 's , um , a volunteer organization of law enforcement officers andwhat ? forensic specialists and prosecutors who try to assist local police in solving old crimes . Murders and kidnappings mostly . They 've been quite successful , have n't they ? " " That 's right , they have . Very good , Alan . Well , Locard is a group similar to the Vidocq Society and has similar goals , though a slightly , mmm , shall we say , different philosophy and approach . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well known as Vidocq , which is mostly by design . Our members are not as prominent . That , too , is partly by design . But as an organization we are very effective . The reason I 'm calling is that we in Locard have just made a decision to consider involving ourselves with a case that involves a crime that occurred in Colorado over ten years back but that also has some intriguing contemporary Colorado connections . I suggested to our screening committee that I thought you could both be of some help in our efforts . You , Lauren , could advise us on the lay of the local prosecutorial landscape . And you , Alan , could help me with some aspects of the case that might involve your clinical skills . The screening committee has already lookeddiscreetly , I assure youinto your backgrounds and authorized me to invite you both to consider assisting us on the case . Should the case develop as we anticipate it will , you would each bring an important local perspective to our investigation . " A. J. told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our participation was purely voluntary , and that we would not be remunerated for our time or for our expenses except for extraordinary travel costs , which would need to be approved in advance by the director of Locard . We looked at each other and shrugged . Lauren told her that we would be happy to consider her request . A. J. explained that we would need to come to Washington , D.C. , at least once and possibly twice or more but that the Colorado family that was imploring Locard to investigate the crime had agreed to provide transportation for the initial visit . " When would this be ? " Lauren asked . " The first meeting is a week from tomorrow . You would need to be at Jefferson County Airport at six o'clock in the morning . That 's close to your home , right ? I 'm told that it is . " " Yes , it 's close enough . " " There will be a plane waiting for you there at a facility called ... " She hesitated and I heard papers ruffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin . You should be back in Colorado the same day if you 're lucky . Midday Sunday at the latest . If you 're required to stay over , someone will make sleeping arrangements . " " And you 'll be there , A. J. ? At the meeting ? " I asked . " Yes , definitely . And one last thing . " We waited . " Please do n't tell anyone we 've talked . Discretion is important . Essential . Agreed ? " " Yes . " " She does n't want us to tell Sam , " I said , a few moments after we hung up the phone . Sam Purdy was a Boulder police detective and a good friend . A. J. had become acquainted with him the previous autumn , too . " I got that impression , too " Lauren agreed . " Any idea why ? " I shook my head . " Secrecy is its own reason . Can you finish making the pizza ? I want to check some of this out on the Internet . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is n't much about Locard as a group . A little about Edmond Locard as an individual . But the Vidocq Society has its own Web page . Lot of heavy hitters are members . You know , CNBC typesthe kind of people who had endless opinions about Monica Lewinsky . Some people who testified in the O. J. trial . Vidocq has a fancy meeting room in a town house in Philadelphia . There 's some blurb on their Web page about cuisine and crime . ' Apparently , they have fancy lunches while they sit around and discuss old crimes . The Web page makes it sound like some kind of club . A regular crime-fighters ' Rotary . " Though Lauren was drinking water , she handed me a glass of red wine . " While you were on the computer I remembered where I 'd heard his name before . Locard . He 's the man responsible for what detectives and crime-scene specialists call Locard 's Exchange Principle . It 's the foundation for the science behind trace evidence . Locard 's the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in close proximity for an extended period , something , some material , either visible or microscopic , will always be exchanged between the two objects . " I smiled . " That 's about all I learned on the Net , too . That and that Locard worked in Lyons . Can you believe we agreed to do this ? " " Yeah , I can . I think it sounds fascinating . I 'm more surprised that we were asked . Let 's face it , Alan , our national reputation as crime fighters is , shall we say ... nonexistent . I suspect that A. J. has an agenda that we do n't know about . " " Do you think it will take up much of our time ? " She shrugged . " I know a couple of people who have done this sort of thing before . My impression is that it 's more of a consultation thing . I do n't think it will be too bad . Anyway , we owe A. J. big-time . " " Yes . We do owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth . " Gosh we make good pizza , do n't we ? " We were in.
