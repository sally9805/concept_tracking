Michigan 's North Country Bank was offering a free gun with a new checking account  --  more bang for the buck , read the ad  --  so naturally Michael Moore had to apply . And he had to ask the friendly officer who helped him with the application : " You think it 's a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank ? " <P> Lock your doors and open your minds , America . Michael Moore is armed again . <P> In Bowling for Columbine , his rambunctious , disturbing , often hilarious new documentary , the leftie perp of Roger &; Me and the best-seller Stupid White Men examines America 's gun culture . Why do we love to shoot and kill things ? And why do we shoot and kill people at rates obscenely higher than those of other countries ? <P> Columbine is a Molotov cocktail of interviews , cartoons , news footage and righteous rabble-rousing . It is also a road movie in search of the troubled soul of America . As Moore told TIME : " It 's a film about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we tend to export a lot of this violence around the world . Because otherwise we 're actually pretty good people . " <P> Moore , 48 , made his name tracking down and confronting corporate executives  --  a tactic that , in his hands , looked less like investigative journalism than self-promotion and stalking . This time he quizzes Charlton Heston on the propriety of proclaiming , at an n.r.a . convention in Littleton , Colo. , just 10 days after the Columbine shootings , that his gun will have to be pried " from my cold , dead hands . " ( At first the star is courteous , but Moore 's questions provoke him to terminate the interview , leaving Moore alone  --  in Heston 's house . ) In most respects , though , the film is crisper than Moore 's earlier work  --  it 's a handsomely assembled essay in words and pictures  --  and less given to finger pointing than head scratching . <P> Moore also looks within . In high school in Flint , Mich. , he won a marksmanship award . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run against Heston for the presidency . He likes guns . He may hear echoes of his youth in the words of a Michigan militia member : " It 's an American responsibility to be armed . If you 're not armed , you 're not responsible . " The director is a little spooked by James Nichols , tofu farmer and brother of Oklahoma City bomber Terry , who shows Moore the loaded Magnum .44 under his pillow and points it at his own temple . Nichols stops short of saying people have the right to weapons-grade plutonium . After all , he sagely notes , " there 's wackos out there . " <P> Moore is an ace propagandist . He employs excoriating anger ( a zippy montage critical of U.S. interventionism , from installing the Shah of Iran in 1953 to giving $245 million in foreign aid to Taliban-run Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 ) , then switches to breezy humor ( a larkish , South Park  --  ish animation on whites ' fear of blacks ) . To a former producer of Cops , he suggests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lay would be strip-searched.
