<p> Kathy Cox : Responses to " Kathy Cox 's hardest lesson , " Page One , Feb. 8 <p> Politician made ill-advised power play <p> I 'm not sure why The Atlanta Journal-Constitution thought it was necessary to spend nearly two pages trying to salvage Schools Superintendent Kathy Cox 's political future . It 's easy to imagine Cox and her religious right political handlers crafting the message points . ( " A teacher , not a politician . . . her picture with Cub Scouts . . . so upset she ran over the family dog . " ) <p> The truth is that Cox is a politician who made an aggressive and ill-advised power play . She failed because there is no credible scientific controversy about evolution , only periodic agitation by a handful of religious extremists . <p> But troubling questions remain . Disturbing edits to the proposed history curriculum and other changes may never receive the scrutiny they deserve . In the end , those of us with children in the public school system can only hope that our schools can provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cox . <p> MARK LEDDEN , Atlanta <p> Actions drive away supporter <p> The feel-good article about state Schools Superintendent Kathy Cox did not change my newfound opinion of her leadership of Georgia 's education . <p> She may be a nice person , but if calling evolution a " buzzword " and the changes in the history curriculum were her ideas , or those of one of her subordinates , she showed poor judgment in even proposing them . The state needs more in-depth education , not watered-down or simplified courses . <p> Cox can take it to the bank that I have been " changed over time " from a person who voted for her into one who will vote for her opponent . <p> JOHN FOSTER , Newnan <p> Lack of leadership the greatest concern <p> Having spoken with Kathy Cox at a meeting last year , I was impressed with her commitment to education in Georgia . Having read about her decision to remove the term evolution from the state curriculum , I continue to respect her as a teacher and an individual . But her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the scientific passages that are part of the national standards remain omitted in her reform proposals . <p> Restoring only the term " evolution " is unacceptable . Unless she provides the leadership to include these accepted scientific concepts , I will continue to question her motives and encourage the voting , taxpaying residents of this state to do the same . <p> JIM CONNELLY , Atlanta <p> Black voters : Responses to Cynthia Tucker 's column " Blacks ' ballots are colorblind , " @issue , Feb. 8 <p> Force comes only from united front <p> Cynthia Tucker missed the point . <p> Supporting a divided black vote diminishes efforts to remove the lingering effects of " white skin privilege . " A century ago , W.E.B . Dubois stated that " the biggest problem facing this country is the existence of the color line . " It 's true , even in these tumultuous times . <p> A demonstration of a solid black vote anywhere is a powerful force that would help level the playing field  --  that is , if one is cognizant of racial disparities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's advice on black votes indicates an " I 've got mine , you get yours " philosophy . A divided black vote is unrewarding , inefficient , weak and difficult to understand . <p> CLINTON E. WARNER , Atlanta <p> Signs of blindness are clearly visible <p> When I began reading Cynthia Tucker 's column , I thought I had mistakenly grabbed the Sunday comics . <p> Tucker laughably tries to convince us that blacks do n't blindly vote for black candidates . Her only proof is that Al Sharpton received only 10 percent of the vote in South Carolina . That an incompetent clown like Sharpton got even one vote  --  let alone more than Wesley Clark and Joe Lieberman combined  --  is only further proof of the blindness of the black vote . Also , Tucker amazingly writes that blacks do n't blindly vote for Democrats . Year after year , blacks complain about the same things and then vote overwhelmingly for Democrats and elect the same people over and over again . If that 's not blind , what do you call it ? <p> NINO GALICH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column " Give marriage firm footing , " @issue , Feb. 8 <p> Wooten 's bigotry toward gays shows <p> Jim Wooten conjures up a terrifying future as characterized by the vertical takeoff in illegitimacy , divorce and adultery . The first step to a turnaround , we are told , is to write gays out of the constitution  --  huh ? <p> Well , contrary to his prejudices , marriage is not just a construct for childbearing and rearing . It is an important part of contract law between consenting adults , affirming the inherent stability of a household , with or without children , including the critical issues of taxation , survivorship and inheritance . <p> To contend that gays do n't have the human qualities to equally participate is , frankly , shocking . And to suggest that we , in his worst dreams , could do any more than the current practitioners to trash the institution of marriage brands him as a garden-variety bigot . <p> DOUG RODGERS , Atlanta <p> Work to protect family institutions <p> I fully agree with Jim Wooten on the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one man and one woman . <p> The advocates of homosexual marriage can not change the fact that homosexuality is neither normal or natural . If it were , gays could reproduce and homosexuality would be rampant in other species . <p> Aside from that , can the polygamists be far behind in demanding marriage ? They can actually make a stronger argument for legal recognition of marriage than gays can . And if society allows this , marriage and all direction of morality will be lost . <p> We must make sure that the dictates of unelected judges do not destroy basic family institutions . Pass the amendment now . <p> KEVIN KITCHEN , Austell <p> Extract government from the equation <p> Conservatives get so confused sometimes . Take government involvement  --  the less the better , or so they say . But you could never tell that from Jim Wooten 's desire to change our state 's constitution to make marriage in his own heterosexual image . <p> Like many people who suffer from competing , laudable ideals , Wooten is confused about how to fix problems against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed by the government that created this " law of unintended consequences . " <p> Wooten says he wants the parent and not the taxpayer to be held accountable for abandoned children . He is correct , and we do need to change the constitution in two ways . The first would prevent the state from recognizing any and all marriages ( thus , divorce and associated attorneys would be obsolete and gay marriage becomes a moot point ) . See how extracting the government can simplify intractable problems ? <p> The second change would prohibit the use of taxpayer money to care for abandoned children unless they are " unadoptable . " This means the private sector such as adoption agencies would assume a greater role , thus making adoptions faster , easier and cheaper . <p> CHUCK NORTON , Alpharetta <p> Tort reform : Responses to " Tort reform battle moves to Capitol , " Metro , Feb. 8 <p> Caps on damages work elsewhere <p> I can not understand why legislators believe that economic damages covering everything from all lost wages to medical expenses and up to $250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawmakers ' opposition to noneconomic caps is not a change in their motives from the best interests of their constituents and toward powerful lobbyists . <p> Caps have worked in other states . Other important reforms are needed  --  increasing the percentage of money to patients ( still leaving trial lawyers well paid ) , focusing liability , creating medical courts and enacting expert witness qualifications  --  but noneconomic caps that limit " pain and suffering " jackpots need to be included . <p> GREG AMAYA , Mableton <p> Better idea : Thin ranks of lawyers <p> The article made no mention of any changes being considered for the legal profession . The fine art and high calling of chasing ambulances will go unchanged . It will remain outrageously profitable for the latecomers who feel none of the tragedy . <p> Something once said of editorial columnists  --  they ride down from the hill after the battle , then shoot the wounded  --  could be applied to medical malpractice attorneys . <p> Doctors are quitting , retiring and being driven out of business . Georgia needs tort reform that would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off with fewer lawyers than fewer doctors . <p> LARRY WHITTINGTON , Alpharetta <p> Not all claims rooted in greed <p> If the malpractice experience of doctors in this state is so high that they ca n't afford malpractice insurance , then our health care system has bigger problems than whether some companies may pull out of the Georgia market . <p> In Georgia we can not keep betting the lives and health of our residents by gambling that the insurance industry 's house is in order , which clearly it is not . It 's just too big a stretch to believe that everyone who files a malpractice lawsuit does so as part of a specious get-rich-quick conspiracy hatched by them and their fee-chasing lawyers . <p> The General Assembly could quickly resolve the manufactured malpractice insurance crisis by holding insurance companies to higher standards and by making certain that those guilty of medical malpractice receive the severest punishment possible . That would lower insurance costs by reducing the number of malpractice cases . <p> DAVID S. MORRISON , Alpharetta <p> Shape system so loser has to pay <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays . " If the plaintiff has a good case , then the plaintiff should reap the benefits of the judgment without limitations  --  but if the plaintiff has a mediocre case , then the plaintiff has a real choice to make : Should the judgment favor the defendant , the plaintiff will be liable for the defendant 's legal expenses . <p> MIKE COSGROVE , Mableton <p> Lobbying : Responses to " Way to legislators ' hearts , " Metro , Feb. 8 <p> Pie-in-the-sky health proposal <p> What if thousands of ordinary Georgians share a great idea but they do n't have the big bucks that corporate lobbyists lavish on state legislators ? What if thousands of us want our state to lead the country in building a program for universal , consolidated , health insurance ? <p> It could save Georgia millions of dollars each year , yet provide everyone with a solid package of comprehensive health benefits . It could bring jobs , business investment and health security to Georgia residents . It could help reverse the recent embarrassments about Georgia 's educational thinking and funding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fussing over claims , eligibility and denials of payment . <p> But a universal health plan is not practical in our General Assembly  --  how would thousands of ordinary Georgians ever raise enough money to compete with the lobbying budgets of the private insurance companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers ? <p> DR . HENRY S. KAHN <p> Kahn , of Atlanta , is a professor emeritus at Emory University School of Medicine . <p> Pork aplenty <p> I was entertained by the article , not so much by the old news that politicians are wined and dined by lobbyists , but that lobbyists serve pork at their parties , as shown in the photo of Rep. Tommy Smith ( D-Nicholls ) " porking out , " pardon the pun , at a recent lobbyist-sponsored party . <p> Maybe the old saying " It takes money to make money " should be modified to " It takes pork to make pork , " which might more accurately describe the lobbyist/politician relationship . <p> STEVE BERNTHAL , Blairsville <p> Voters never were enamored of Dean <p> Your article describing Howard Dean 's reversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune you never had ( " What went wrong , " Page One , Feb. 8 ) ? <p> The professional politicians and media that trumpeted Dean 's image as the leading candidate simply forgot that voters  --  not focus groups , flash polls , journalists or professional campaign workers  --  decide who wins . " Front-runner status " has no meaning ; all that really matters are the votes that are cast . <p> You make a good point , though : Dean apparently spent $41 million in a short time , with nothing substantive to show for it . In that way , he is similar to the Internet companies of the late ' 90s , and shows that he probably has little to offer the nation 's voters . <p> GARY O'NEILL , Marietta <p> Democrats ' splurge benefited Americans <p> George Will lays the two biggest post-1945 , post-election federal spending sprees to Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush and their respective party majorities ( " What Bush does n't know hurts us , " @issue , Feb. 8 ) . But there 's a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and middle-class parents and us Medicare . The " conservative Republican " splurge bought us the liberation and reconstruction of Iraq with fat contracts for Halliburton , Bechtel and other corporate cronies . <p> As long as my tax dollars are going to be squandered by either party , I vote for the one that splurges on me . <p> LAURIE CRAW , Cave Spring <p> All about bottom line <p> A letter writer critical of Home Depot needs to understand that the purpose of a corporation is to make a profit for its shareholders ( " Home Depot has whitewashed diversity , " Letters , Feb. 8 ) . Its purpose is not the hiring of African-Americans . <p> The first requirement is to hire the best people for the job , without regard to anybody 's color or gender . <p> GORDON KILGOREM , Sharpsburg <p> Beatles were good , but not Elvis ' caliber <p> I enjoy the Beatles as much as anyone , but I disagree that they had a greater impact or were more important than Elvis Presley . <p> John Lennon himself said that before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make teenagers a cultural force . <p> The Beatles are the best band ever  --  but more important than Elvis ? I think not . <p> MARTY BROWN , Tucker
