Portland , Maine <p> September 16 , 2005 <p> Friday . 5:30 A.M. <p> Fog can be a sudden thing on the Maine coast . On even the clearest mornings , swirling gray mists sometimes appear in an instant , covering the earth with an opacity that makes it hard to see even one 's own feet on the ground . On this particular September morning it descended at 5:30 , about the time Lucinda Cassidy and her companion Fritz , a small dog of indeterminate pedigree , arrived at the cemetery on Vaughan Street to begin their four-mile run along the streets of Portland 's West End and the path that borders the city 's Western Promenade . <p> The cemetery was one of Portland 's oldest and was surrounded by a chain-link fence , now falling into disrepair . The gates on the Vaughan Street side were locked to keep out neighborhood dog walkers . The earliest gravestones dated back to the late 1700s . On most of these stones , dates and other specifics had faded to near illegibility . Those that could be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deering , Dana , Brackett , Reed , Preble . These were old Yankee names , many of which had achieved a mea sure of immortality , having been bestowed upon the streets and parks of a young and growing city . More recent stones marked the graves of Irish , Italian , and French-Canadian immigrants who came to Portland to work in the city 's thriving shipbuilding trades or on the railroads in the last half of the nineteenth century . Today , however , no more of the dead would be buried here , regardless of ancestry or influence . The place was full , the last remains having been interred and the last markers erected in the years immediately following World War II . <p> When the fog moved in , Lucy considered canceling her run , but only briefly . At age twenty-eight , she was preparing for her first 10K race . She had more than enough self-discipline not to let anything as transitory as a little morning fog interfere with her training schedule . It was tough enough getting the runs in , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Beckman and Hawes , the city 's biggest ad agency . In any case , Lucy knew her route well . The fog would n't be a problem as long as she took care not to trip on one of the sidewalk 's uneven pavers . <p> The air was cool on her bare legs as Lucy performed her stretches  --  calves and quads and hamstrings . She pulled off her oversized Bates College sweatshirt , revealing a white sports bra and blue nylon shorts , and tossed it into her car , an aging Toyota Corolla . <p> She saw no other joggers or dog walkers and thought she and Fritz might well have the streets to themselves . She slipped off his collar to let him run free . He was well trained and would n't go far . She pulled a Portland Sea Dogs cap down over her blond hair , stretching the Velcro band down and under her ponytail . She draped the dog 's lead around her shoulders and set off along Vaughan Street at a leisurely pace , with Fritzy first racing ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamppost . <p> Lucy liked the quiet of the early morning hours in this upscale neighborhood . Passing street after street of graceful nineteenth-century homes , she glanced in the windows and imagined herself living in one or another of them . The image pleased her . She saw herself holding elegant dinner parties . The food would be simple but perfectly prepared . The wines rare . The men handsome . The conversation witty . All terribly Masterpiece Theatre . Ah well , a pretty picture but not very likely . She was not , she knew , to the manner born . She watched Fritz scamper ahead and then turn and wait for her to follow . <p> Lucy moved through the damp morning air , bringing her heart rate up to an aerobic training level . She thought about the day ahead , reviewing , for at least the twentieth time , details of a TV campaign she was presenting to the marketing group at Mid-Coast Bank . She 'd worked her tail off to land this new client , but they were turning out to be both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick trip to Circuit City to pick up a birthday present for her soon-to-be twelve-year-old nephew Owen . Her older sister Patti 's boy , Owen told her what he " really really wanted " was an iPod , but he was n't optimistic . " We do n't have the money this year , " he added in grown-up , serious tones that had Patti 's imprint all over them . Well , Owen was in for a big surprise . <p> After that it was back to the Old Port for dinner with David at Tony 's . The prospect of dinner at Tony 's pleased her . The prospect of sharing it with her ex-husband did n't . He was pushing to get back together , and yes , she admitted , there were times she was briefly tempted . God knows , no one else even remotely interesting was waiting in the wings . Yet after a couple of dates , she was surer than ever that going back to David was n't the answer for either of them . She planned to tell him so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , climbing the gentle rise of Bramhall Hill , before turning west across the old section of the hospital toward the path that lined the western edge of the Prom . The fog was thicker now , and she could see even less , but her body felt good . The training was paying off , and she felt certain she 'd be ready for the race , now ten days away . <p> Suddenly Fritz darted past and disappeared into the mist , barking furiously at what Lucy figured was either an animal or another runner coming up the path in her direction . Then she saw Fritz run out of the fog , turn , and stand his ground , angry barks lifting his small body in an uncharacteristic rage . Instantly alert , Lucy wondered who or what could be getting him so agitated . Usually he just wagged his stub of a tail at strangers . <p> Seconds later a runner emerged from the fog about fifteen feet in front of her . He was a tall man with a lean , well-muscled body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . He was unusually good-looking with dark , deep-set eyes that would be hard to forget . Late thirties or early forties , she thought . Fritz backed away but kept barking . <p> " Quiet down , " Lucy commanded . " It 's okay . " She smiled at the man . " He is n't usually so noisy . " <p> The tall man stopped and knelt down . He extended his left hand for Fritz to sniff , then scratched him behind the ears . He smiled up at Lucy . " What 's his name ? " <p> Lucy registered the absence of a wedding band . " Fritz , " she said . <p> " Hey , Fritz , are you a good boy ? Sure you are . " He scratched Fritz again . The dog 's stubby tail offered a tentative wag or two . He looked up . " I 've seen you running here before . I 'm sure I have . " <p> " You may have , " she said , though she was sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings . I 'm training for a 10K . " <p> " Good for you . Mind if I run along ? I 'd enjoy the company . " <p> She hesitated , surprised at the man 's directness . Finally she said , " I guess not . Not as long as you can keep up . I 'm Lucy . " <p> " Harry , " he said , extending a hand . " Harry Potter . " <p> " You 're kidding . " <p> " No , I was christened long before the first book came out , and I was n't about to change my name . " <p> They took off , chatting easily , laughing about the name . Fritz , no longer barking , kept pace . <p> " You live in Portland ? " she asked . <p> " No , I 'm here on business . Medical equipment . The hospital 's one of my biggest clients . " <p> " So you 're here quite often ? " <p> " At least once a month . " <p> They picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Prom . <p> " Normally there 's a great view from up here . Ca n't see a damned thing today . " <p> A dark green SUV sat parked at the curb just ahead of them . " Could you excuse me for a minute ? " Harry pointed and clicked a key ring . The car 's lights blinked ; its doors unlocked . " I need to get something . " <p> He leaned in , rummaged in a small canvas bag , and then emerged from the car holding a hypodermic and a small bottle . " I 'm a diabetic , " he explained . " I have to take my insulin on schedule . " Harry carefully inserted the needle into the bottle and extracted a clear liquid . " Only take a second . " Lucy smiled . Feeling it was rude to watch , she turned away and looked out over the Prom . The fog was n't dissipating . If anything it seemed to be getting thicker . She performed a few stretches to keep her muscles warm while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement behind her . Before she could react , Harry Potter 's left arm was around her neck , pulling her sharply back and up in a classic choke hold . Her windpipe constricted in the crook of his elbow . She could n't move . She wanted to scream but could draw only enough breath to emit a thin , strangled cry . <p> Frantic and confused , Lucy dug her nails into the man 's flesh , wishing she 'd let them grow longer and more lethal . She felt a sharp prick . She looked down and saw the man 's free hand squeezing what ever was in the hypodermic into her arm . He continued holding her , immobile . She tried to struggle , but he was too strong , his grip too tight . Within seconds wooziness began to overtake her . She felt his hands on the back of her head and her butt , pushing her , headfirst , facedown , into the backseat of the car . <p> Turning her head , Lucy could still see out through the open door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a slow-motion film growing darker frame by frame and seeming to make no sense . She saw an enraged Fritz growling and digging his teeth into the man 's leg . She heard a shout , " Shit ! " Two large hands picked the small dog up . She tried to rise but could n't . The last thing Lucinda Cassidy saw was the good-looking man with the dark eyes . He smiled at her . The slow-motion film faded to black . <p> Excerpted from The Cutting by James Hayman . <p> Copyright 2009 by James Hayman . <p> Published in July 2009 by St. Martin 's
