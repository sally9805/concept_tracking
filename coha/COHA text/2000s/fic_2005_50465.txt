" In broad terms , science fiction and science have always danced around each other . Science fiction is the subconscious of science . It 's what scientists would do if they could .... " <p> - Greg Bear , interview in Locus , February 2000 . <p> I CHECKED my schedule and winced . My next patient was Mr. Science . An exceedingly tough case . Almost made me want to retire my couch . I had never faced such an intractable subject before . Although Mr. Science was plainly suffering from a myriad of repressed neuroses and their repercussions in his life , he just could n't seem to untangle that portion of his personality that was responsible for his troubles . I had been delving into Mr. Science 's subconscious for over three years now , and still had n't made a scintilla of progress . By all textbook standards , Mr. Science and I should have been able to achieve by now at least some forward movement toward integrating his dark side , toward defusing those submerged aspects of his personality that interfered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the attention paid to his quirky subconscious only strengthened it . <p> I dreaded hearing what new troubles Mr. Science 's neurotic behavior had caused him since our last visit . That was the way we always began our sessions , with a recounting of the pitfalls Mr. Science had dug for himself . <p> Unable to delay the inevitable any longer , I buzzed Mr. S. into my office . <p> Mr. Science was an unprepossessing sort . Neither diminutive nor strapping , neither ugly nor handsome , neither self-effacing nor charismatic , neither introverted nor extroverted , he was just average , the type of fellow you could pass on the street and simply not register one way or another . He wore , as usual , his white , stained labcoat , having come for our twice-weekly lunch-hour session straight from the nearby university where he did his research . <p> We shook hands and exchanged some perfunctory greetings . Then Mr. Science stretched himself out upon the couch and launched into his newest litany of woes in a troubled voice . <p> " I was composing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to the section regarding staffing , I found myself requesting ' six mentats . ' I have no actual idea as to what a ' mentat ' might be , or what they might do . But it suddenly seemed imperative that I have six of them for my project to succeed . " <p> This was utterly typical of Mr. Science 's missteps and mental selfbetrayals . From some deep well of the subconscious , he would dredge up the most bizarre concepts , terms and actions . I had almost given up all hope of discovering the source of these ideations , and was now reduced to grasping at conceptual straws . <p> " Mr. Science , perhaps you 're suffering from glossolalia . You know , speaking in tongues . Or it could be Tourette 's . This strange jargon you 're always spouting - it could be just a neurological glitch . " <p> Mr. Science looked thoughtful . " No , no , it 's much more than that . When I wrote down ' six mentals ' I had a definite conception about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but at the time it was a solid impression . " <p> I sought to move on . " Well , if that was the worst thing that happened since our last session - " <p> " Oh , but it 's not . " A blush spread across Mr. Science 's face . " Last night , I refused to have sex with my wife . We 've been trying to have a child , you see , and accordingly neither one of us was using any birth-control method . But it suddenly seemed to me that my wife was a member of a humanoid alien species , and that if she got pregnant , it would mean her death , as the carnivorous baby consumed her body for its first postparturition meal . " <p> I said nothing for a good ten seconds . Frankly , I was stupefied . I had personally heard many sexual psychoses in my career , and knew of many more through reading , but this delusion was beyond all my experience . <p> " What - what did your wife say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't tell her in so many words . So I shifted the blame to myself by claiming that I simply was n't in kemmer yet . " <p> " Kemmer ? What is that term ? " <p> Mr. Science looked baffled and worried . " Did I say something odd ? What was it ? I 'm afraid I ca n't now recall - " <p> My patience reached a sudden end , and I spoke sternly . " Mr. Science , together we have been exploring your psyche for some three years now , and I do n't feel we 're any closer to explicating your dysfunctional behavior than we were at the start . In fact , all my dedicated months of therapy seem to have done is to make your troubles worse . It 's as if having an audience has encouraged you to act out . More and more you are capitulating to your delusions . I get the sense that you actually enjoy these counterfactual forays into the world of your unfettered imagination . In fact , I 'm beginning to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not suffering from a multiple personality disorder . I suspect that I 'm reaching a buried part of you that delights in the unconventional and far-out . " <p> Mr. Science began to weep softly . " It 's true , I admit it . The life of a scientist is so boring , so methodical , so frustrating . There 's nothing exciting or vibrant or colorful about it . I love the subject matter of my field , but the damn scientific method and the small incremental steps it involves are stifling my soul ! Not to mention the bureaucracy , the rivalries , the teaching , the dry , tedious language of the journals . I want the allure of science without the drudgery and heartless logic . I want to revel in vast vistas of time and space , to have exotic sex with oviparous Martian princesses , to travel faster than light and read minds , to have robotic best friends and converse with intelligent dogs . But I do n't know how to get any of that ! " <p> I let Mr. Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we 're finally making some progress . This is most heartening . By acknowledging these impossible desires , we 've finally taken a step toward banishing them . I 'm afraid our fifty minutes are up now , however , Mr. Science . But I 'm confident we 'll take even bigger strides toward your cure the next time we meet . " <p> After seeing the sniffling Mr. Science out the door , I returned to my desk . I opened a lower drawer , activated the ansible communicator linking me to the Sevagram in Fomalhaut , and reported that I was almost ready to close another case . <p>
