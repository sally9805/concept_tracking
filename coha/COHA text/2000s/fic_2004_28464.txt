Chapter One " What 's with the thread , Oma ? You need me to put it away ? " Katie Schmidt watched from beside the bed as her grandmother cradled a brownish , oversize spool between her arthritic fingers , then set it down in her lap as delicately as if it belonged in a museum case . " No , Katarina . " The older woman smiled to herself , then lifted her head to focus clear blue eyes on Katie . " This thread is the story of our family . I had your father get it from my cedar chest for you . You will listen to me now , ja ? It is very important you listen . " " I 'm listening . " Katie flashed Oma a smile , then busied herself smoothing the afghan at the foot of Oma 's bed . Oma was dying - Katie 's father had broken that news to her several months ago - but not of any illness that would affect her thinking . " Come , Schatzi . " The gray-haired woman patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen-year-old Katie to occupy . " I will tell you the truth about this old thread . It has saved our family many times . And now I give it to you . This thread , you see , it is magic . " Katie did n't smirk or roll her eyes , though she knew most of her friends would . From an early age , her father had taught her that Oma deserved serious respect . Oma 's grandparents came over fromGermany in the late 1800s , along with the rest of Bowen , Nebraska 's first settlers , to work for the railroad . Their son , Oma 's father , became the town 's second - and still most beloved - mayor . The fire station , built during his time in office , still bore a huge plaque with his name . Oma 's mother , whose family emigrated from Germany just before World War I , raised most of the money to build the town 's first multiroom school . She 'd made certain Oma would be the first person from Bowen , male or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even learned English until high school . Oma went on to run The Bowen Bride , a fabulously succesful bridal gown design shop , until just a few years ago , when arthritis forced her to close the doors and rent out the space . So even though Oma told some strange tales , Katie 'd learned long ago not to question a word . Someone like Oma , whose entire life story paralleled Bowen 's past , spoke the gospel on matters of history , at least in the mind of town residents . And , as far as Katie was concerned , the expectations resulting from Oma 's reputation were the number-one reason to get out of town and go live in a big city . Someplace where you did n't have to speak and act and believe exactly the same as your neighbor or risk being the subject of gossip . Someplace where you were n't subjected to constant retellings of how your grandfather was chosen to lead the Bowen Fourth of July parade back in the Mesozoic era . Someplace where a girl 's main goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska man . Yeesh . That was the worst expectation of all . But until she graduated high school , Katie did n't have much choice in how she lived her life . Thank goodness she 'd already been accepted to college in Boston . Only three more months and she 'd be free . Of course , she still had to break the news to her father . She straightened the crocheted armrest covers on her late Opa 's wing chair , then plunked next to her grandmother . " All right , Oma . Why 's the thread magic ? " The old woman placed the spool in Katie 's hands , then wrapped her knotted hands around Katie 's . " What most people would find magic is that this thread , it never runs out . When my own Oma , and then my father , told me its secrets , of course I did not believe them . Such a thing can not be , ja ? But it is true . My Oma 's parents brought this spool with them from the old country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family used this thread , but still it is here . " " Interesting . " Katie tried to sound as if she believed every word . But wishing to believe for Oma 's sake was n't the same as actually believing . " So how did this never-ending thread save our family ? " Oma 's face crinkled into a smile . " That is the true magic of the thread . It has the ability to bring lifelong love . Love that lasts through everything , through loss , through pain , even through deception . You might not understand how powerful love can be now , since you are still a child - " Katie raised an eyebrow , making it clear she did not consider herself a child , but her grandmother merely shook her head . " What is eighteen when compared to eighty or ninety ? You will see . You will experience what the world offers , and you will see that love has incredible power . And this thread , it gives that power . I do not know how it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the years in my shop , on every single gown I ever made . When stitched into a wedding dress , a couple will stay married forever . I never had a bride who - " " Katie ! " Katie 's dad strode into the room , then shook his head when he spied the thread in his mother 's lap . He turned to Katie . " You 're supposed to be straightening up in here . " " She did . And now I am talking to her , " Oma said , defiant . From the expression on her father 's face , Katie gathered that he did n't like Oma waxing poetic about a spool of ratty thread . " If she 's done straightening , then she can help me get you ready for your doctor 's appointment . You 're supposed to be there in twenty minutes . " Oma frowned , but nodded . Katie 's dad ducked back out of the room , presumably to find his car keys . Once he left , Oma again squeezed her hands around Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it . And believe in it . " " I 'll keep it in my sewing box , all right ? Would that make you happy ? " The old woman nodded , then closed her eyes and relaxed back against her pillows . " You will not throw it away ? Never ? " Her voice came out in a whisper , making Katie wonder if she would fall asleep before her appointment . " No , Oma . Never . " Dad would kill her if she let Oma go to sleep now . " Come on . You need to get up . " ( Continues ... )
