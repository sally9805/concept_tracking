Chapter One IN WHICH the Grace Twins Are Triplets Jared could n't move from the doorway . He heard the clanging of swords and cheering , but the sounds seemed to come from far away . He watched in horror as the coach confronted his double . The man got red in the face , and some of the other players looked at Jared 's double in shock . " Great . " Jared grimaced . There was no way he could explain this . The coach pointed toward the large gym door , and he watched Not-Jared stalk toward it - and toward him . As Not-Jared got closer to Jared , it smirked . Jared clenched his hands into fists . Not-Jared passed Jared without a single glance , slamming through the double doors . Jared wanted to find some way to wipe that smile off its face . He followed after it , into a hallway lined with lockers . " Who are you ? " Jared demanded . " What do you want ? " Not-Jared turned to face him , and something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you know me ? Am I not your own self ? " Its mouth curled into a sneer . It was strange to watch it move and speak . It was n't like watching Simon , with his tidy hair and the smear of toothpaste on his upper lip . And it was n't quite himself either - the hair was messier , and the eyes were darker and ... different . It took a step toward him . Jared took a step back , wishing for any kind of faerie protection , and then he remembered the pocketknife in his jeans . Faeries hated iron , and steel was at least part iron . He opened one of the blades . " Why do n't you all just leave us alone ? " The creature threw back its head and laughed . " You can never get away from your own self . " " Shut up ! You 're not me . " Jared pointed the knife at his double . " Put that toy away , " Not-Jared said , its voice low and harsh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sent you , but bet I know what you 're looking for , " said Jared . " The Guide . Well , you 're never going to get it . " The creature 's grin widened into something that still was n't really a smile . Then suddenly it shrank back as though frightened . Jared watched in amazement as the Not-Jared 's body shrank , its dark hair paled into a sandy brown , and its now blue eyes went wide with terror . Before Jared could fully comprehend what he was seeing , he heard a woman 's voice behind him . " What 's going on here ? Put that knife down . " The vice principal rushed up , grabbing Jared 's wrist . The pocketknife clattered to the linoleum floor . Jared stared at the blade as the sandy-haired boy ran off down the hall , his sobs sounding a lot like laughter . " I ca n't believe you brought your knife to school , " Simon whispered to Jared as they sat together outside the vice principal 's office . Jared shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even once to the police - that he was only showing the kid the knife , but they 'd never found the other boy to confirm the story . Then the vice principal had asked Jared to wait outside . Their mother had been in the vice principal 's office a long time , but Jared could n't hear what was going on . " What kind of faerie do you think that thing was ? " Simon asked . Jared shrugged . " I wish we had the book so I could look it up . " " You do n't remember anything that could shape-shift like that ? " " I do n't know . " Jared rubbed his face . " Look , I told Mom it was n't your fault . You 'll just have to explain . " Jared gave a short laugh . " Yeah , like I can tell her what happened . " " I could say that kid stole something from Mallory 's bag . " When Jared did n't respond , Simon tried again . " I could pretend I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jared just shook his head . Finally their mother emerged from the vice principal 's office . She looked tired . " I 'm sorry , " Jared said . He was surprised by the calm tone of her voice . " I do n't want to talk about it , Jared . Get your sister and let 's just go . " Jared nodded and followed Simon , looking back just in time to see their mother sink down in the chair he 'd vacated . What was she thinking ? Why was n't she yelling ? He found himself wishing that she was mad - at least that he would understand . Her quiet sadness was more frightening . It was like this was all she expected of him . Simon and Jared walked through the school , stopping to ask fencing team members if they 'd seen Mallory . None of them had . They even stopped Chris-the-captain . He looked uncomfortable when they asked about Mallory , but he shook his head . The gymnasium was empty , the only sounds the echo of their steps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up , and everything from the meet had been put away . Finally a girl with long , brown hair told them she 'd seen Mallory crying in the girls ' bathroom . Simon shook his head . " Mallory ? Crying ? But she won . " The girl shrugged . " I asked her if she was okay , but she said she was fine . " " You think that was really her ? " Simon asked as they walked toward the restroom . " You mean , was something impersonating her ? Why would a faerie turn into Mallory and then cry in a girls ' bathroom ? " " I do n't know , " said Simon . " I 'd cry if I had to turn into Mallory . " Jared snorted . " So , you want to go in there and look for her ? " " I 'm not going into the girls ' room , " Simon said . " Besides , you 're already in so much trouble , there 's no way you can get into more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jared said with a sigh . He pushed open the door . It looked surprisingly like the boys ' room , except there were no urinals . " Mallory ? " he called . No answer . He peered under the stalls but did n't see any feet . He pushed open one of the doors gingerly . Even though there was no one in there , he felt weird , jumpy and embarrassed . After a moment he darted back out into the hall . " She 's not in there ? " Simon said . " It 's empty . " Jared glanced past the line of lockers , hoping no one had seen him . " Maybe she went to the office looking for us , " Simon said . " I do n't see her anywhere . " A feeling of dread uncoiled in the pit of Jared 's stomach . After the vice principal had caught him , he had n't really thought about anything but how much trouble he was in . But that thing was still running around the school . He remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the match . " What if she went outside ? " Jared said , hoping that they could still find her before it did . " She could have gone out to see if we were waiting by the car . " " We could look . " Simon shrugged . Jared could tell he was n't convinced , but they walked outside anyway . The sky had already deepened to purples and golds . In the dimming light they walked past the track and the baseball field . " I do n't see her , " Simon said . Jared nodded . His stomach churned with nervousness . Where is she ? he wondered . " Hey , " Simon said . " What 's that ? " He walked a few feet and leaned down to pick up something shining in the grass . " Mallory 's fencing medal , " Jared said . " And look . " On the grass large chunks of rock formed a circle around the medal . Jared knelt down beside the largest stone . Engraved deeply in the rock was a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like from the quarry . " Jared looked up , surprised . " Remember the map we found ? It said dwarves live in the quarry - but I do n't think dwarves can shape-shift . " " Mallory could still be inside with Mom . She could be in the office waiting for us . " Jared wanted to believe it . " Then why is her medal out here ? " " Maybe she dropped it . Maybe this is a trap . " Simon started walking back toward the school . " Come on , " he said . " Let 's go back and see if she 's with Mom . " Jared nodded numbly . When they got back inside , they found their mother in the school entrance , talking into her cell phone . Her back was to them , and she was alone . Although their mother was speaking softly , her voice traveled easily to where they crouched . " Yeah , I thought things were getting better too . But , you know , Jared never admitted to what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to sound strange , but Mallory and Simon are so protective of him . " Jared froze , both dreading what she was going to say and unable to make himself do anything to stop her from continuing . " No , no . They deny he ever did any of those things . And they 're keeping something from me . I can tell by the way they stop talking when they come into a room , the way they cover for one another , especially for Jared . You should have heard Simon tonight , making up excuses for his brother pulling a knife on that little boy . " Here she made a choked noise and began crying . " I just do n't know if I can handle him anymore . He is so angry , Richard . Maybe he should go and stay with you for a while . " Dad . She was talking to their dad . Simon jabbed Jared in the arm . " Come on . Mallory 's not here . " Jared turned dazedly and followed his brother out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt at that moment - except maybe hollow . ( Continues ... )
