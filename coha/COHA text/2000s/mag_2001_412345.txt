Section : BOOKS , ARTS &; MANNERS <p> Professor J.R.R. Tolkien was grading papers on a summer day in 1928 when he came upon a blank page in an exam book . Something inspired him to scribble a few words : " In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit . " The whole thing might have ended there , but it was only a beginning . " Names always generate a story in my mind , " he explained later . " Eventually I thought I 'd better find out what hobbits were like . " <p> By now , millions of readers know what hobbits are like . They 're the short , rustic , and unlikely heroes of the 20th century 's best-loved book , The Lord of the Rings , as well as The Hobbit , a preceding story written mainly for children . They 're about to become even more familiar : New Line Cinema has just released The Fellowship of the Ring , the first of an expensive trilogy of movies based on Tolkien 's masterpiece . Before long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an inkling of what hobbits are like . <p> This will annoy certain people . If Tolkien has an army of fawning admirers , he also has a legion of fierce detractors . When readers chose The Lord of the Rings as " the greatest book of the century " in a 1997 poll by the British bookseller Waterstone 's , the reaction from the critical class was quick and harsh . " Horrifying , " gasped the Times Literary Supplement . " Novels do n't come more fictional than that , " sneered Germaine Greer . " The books that come from Tolkien 's train are more or less what you would expect ; flight from reality is their dominating characteristic . " <p> If the new film version of The Lord of the Rings is seen as a flight from reality , then it has impeccable timing ; after September 11 , retreating into a fantasy realm of wizards and ringwraiths sounds like a welcome diversion . The movie does fulfill its simple promise of entertainment . Yet the book on which it is based offers the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fundamental concerns of this world : the nature of evil , the lure of power , and the duty of courage . In other words , it considers questions that definitely have not preoccupied the cultural elite for more than a generation . <p> At bottom , The Lord of the Rings is a deeply conservative book-a fact that may explain the hostility it faces from some quarters . Tolkien is often credited with the radical act of inventing the sword-and-sorcery epic , a genre of literature filed alongside science fiction in the bookstores . Surely he has many imitators ; but he viewed himself in an altogether different light , as the heir to a grand tradition rather than the author of a new one . He called his Middle Earth a " sub-creation , " partly in deference to the real Creator ( Tolkien was a devout Catholic ) but also because he owed so much to writers who lived centuries before him . <p> Knowing and understanding these writers was his day job as an Oxford University philologist-that is , an expert on the historical forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would still be remembered for his impressive scholarship : He penned what is perhaps the most influential essay ever written about Beowulf ; many of the students enrolled in medieval-English-lit courses probably have encountered his popular translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight . Tolkien was a giant in his academic field , and left a mark that remains there today . <p> For Tolkien , though , the old stories were more than texts to analyze ; they were a vital source of personal inspiration . Characters and events in The Lord of the Rings often echo the half-forgotten poems of the Anglo-Saxons , the Vikings , and their kin . There is hardly a proper noun in Tolkien 's oeuvre that does n't derive in some fashion from the ancient manuscripts of northern Europe . In The Lord of the Rings , for instance , Gandalf is the name of a good and great wizard ; in the 13th-century Norse epic known as the Elder Edda , it is the name of a dwarf . Tolkien borrowed it to indulge his philologist 's love of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tolkien intended to create an imaginary world that was fundamentally real , or at least potentially real . He did not want readers merely to suspend their disbelief in hobbits and elves ; he wanted them to believe in their possibility . He devised whole languages and elaborate histories of Middle Earth long before he started writing the stories that would make use of them-they filled reams of notebooks that have been published posthumously as The Silmarillion and several other tomes . In the end , Middle Earth became a place that was so real to him that he compared actual places to it , rather than the other way around . ( Venice , he once wrote , was " like a dream of Old Gondor . " ) <p> For the rest of us , of course , detailed accounts of wars between dwarves and orcs do n't exactly enhance Middle Earth 's realism . Yet Middle Earth is emphatically not another planet-it is our own world in a much earlier age . We have no specific knowledge of the era because it is so remote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our cultural memory through fairy tales and nursery rhymes . As a narrator in the movie puts it , " History became legend , legend became myth . " In the book , Gandalf provides a fuller explanation when one of his companions asks about an odd creature they 've met . " Is it so long since you listened to tales by a fireside ? There are children in your land who , out of the twisted threads of story , could pick the answer to your question , " says Gandalf . " Songs we have that tell of these things , but we are forgetting them , teaching them only to children , as careless custom . " <p> Take the word " orc , " the name given to a nasty race of goblin-like monsters . It appears in Beowulf as " orc-neas . " Rendered into modern English from Beowulf 's Old English ( a language almost as foreign to our ears as German ) , it means something like " demon-corpse , " or perhaps " zombie . " But the truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its precise definition or etymology-leaving open the delightful idea that there 's far more to its meaning and background than what is dreamt of in our philosophy . <p> One of the most famous questions scholars have asked about Beowulf is whether it 's a Christian poem ; it seems to have been written by a Christian , but it deals with a pagan society . Likewise , there is no mention of God or even religion in Middle Earth . Yet Tolkien considered the book a reflection of his own faith . " The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work ; unconsciously so at first , but consciously in the revision , " wrote Tolkien in 1953 . " The religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism . " There are many examples of this , though readers frequently overlook them . A close examination of the appendices ( there are six , plus indexes and maps ) reveals a detail that goes unmentioned in the main narrative : The nine companions who comprise " the fellowship of the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and their story climaxes exactly three months later , on March 25 ( in the traditional English calendar , the date of the Fall of Man , the Annunciation , and the Crucifixion ) . Too much can be read into all this-Tolkien insisted that his book was not an allegory-but it does carry at least a limited meaning . Tom Shippey , Tolkien 's finest interpreter , calls it " a kind of signature , a personal mark of piety . " <p> The Lord of the Rings , then , is not an explicitly Christian work , but it is entirely consistent with Christianity . This is an essential element for Tolkien . As Josph Pearce points out in his literary biography of Tolkien , " his Catholicism was not an opinion to which one subscribed but a reality to which one submitted . " There is nothing in what he wrote that contradicts Christian belief . Middle Earth is un-Christian only in the sense that everything coming before Christ is un-Christian . <p> Tolkien does more than strive to avoid contradiction , however ; he filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian truth that had not yet revealed itself in fullness . Early on , when Frodo says he wishes someone would kill Gollum , a pitiful beast who haunts Tolkien 's heroes , Gandalf objects . " Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment . For even the very wise can not see all ends . I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies , but there is a chance of it , " he says . " My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet , for good or ill , before the end . " Indeed Gollum does , and he contributes to a medley of themes about knowledge , salvation , and eternity . <p> The Lord of the Rings may be read and enjoyed without reference to any theology whatsoever ; it is a wonderful and well-told story . The movie is more or less faithful to it , but only gestures toward the deeper questions . It succeeds mainly as an exciting tale . Yet a full appreciation of Tolkien 's accomplishment requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proclamation of any novel as the greatest of the 20th century is as much a burden as an accolade ; it sets up the book for all kinds of sniping , lots of it undeserved . Yet it is impossible to deny the extraordinary fondness millions of ordinary readers have shown for The Lord of the Rings over the last five decades , and very difficult to disagree with the simple judgment of W.H. Auden : " If someone dislikes it , I shall never trust their literary judgment about anything again . " <p> By John J. Miller <p>
