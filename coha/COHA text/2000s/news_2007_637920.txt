<p> NEW ORLEANS  --  The smell of sizzling beef and warm flour tortillas beckons from a food truck perched at an intersection here . <p> Inside , Maria Jimenez doles out tacos and fajitas thick with meat , cheese and lettuce . Most people who come to Taqueria Los Poblanos order beef or pork tacos . But regulars also like the minced lengua , or tongue . <p> Food trucks such as this one  --  offering flavorful , cheap and authentic Latin-American fare  --  were all but non-existent before Katrina . They now dot the landscape in New Orleans and neighboring Jefferson Parish . Their regular customers are the Hispanic laborers who have migrated here to rebuild homes , but they 've also built a following among local residents . <p> In the New Orleans area , permits issued to mobile vendors that prepare food on their trucks  --  such as taquerias and hot dog vendors  --  jumped nearly eightfold from July 2005 to July 2006 , the state health department says . Through July 2007 , another 83 new permits were issued , up 36% from last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fan . In June , the Jefferson Parish Council voted unanimously to bar mobile vendors from setting up shop at some of the busiest thoroughfares in the area . The parish also limited how long the trucks could be stationary : 30 minutes . And it decreed that mobile vendors who stay at one site any longer must have a restroom accessible to customers . <p> Food vendors complain that the parish is trying to put them out of business . The rules make it nearly impossible for mobile vendors to work in the area , says Carmela Diaz , owner of Taqueria Sanchez . <p> " We are going to fight it , " Diaz says . " This is not a sit-down restaurant . People take food to go , " so the taqueria should n't be required to have a restroom . <p> But Jeff Charlet , regulatory manager of the Jefferson Parish Department of Inspection and Code Enforcement , says the state has long required take-out and dine-in eateries , as well as stores , office buildings and schools , to have bathrooms accessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her four taquerias . She shut down one of her two in Jefferson Parish in early July because it was in a prohibited zone . Police and immigration officers effectively closed another in New Orleans , she says , by telling her she was on private property and would be arrested if she did n't leave . New Orleans police say they have no record of the incident . Officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement could n't confirm the incident . <p> In New Orleans , David Robinson-Morris , a spokesman for Mayor Ray Nagin , says the city is n't considering changes to mobile food cart rules . " At this time , from the mayor 's office , there is n't any concern , " he says . " They 're not posing any threat as long as they 're following the ordinances and they 're licensed . " <p> National civil rights groups say they fear the crackdown on mobile food carts is a warning sign of residents ' rising tensions with the Hispanic community , whose numbers here have swollen since Katrina . <p> " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public nuisance  --  and then you 've got other ordinances that follow , regarding language access , English-only signs , housing , " says Anita Sinha , a staff attorney at the Advancement Project in Washington , a civil rights group . <p> Thomas Capella , chairman of the Jefferson Parish Council , defends the new rules , saying , " Everybody is restricted , not just the Spanish food carts . What was happening is that people were camping out on vacant property and basically becoming a restaurant or cafe . " <p> Some carts also pose health and safety concerns , says Louis Congemi , a Jefferson Parish councilman . " I would n't personally eat at one , " Congemi says . <p> George Ketry , a New Orleans cab driver , finds the carts " can be an eyesore . " But his bigger worry , he says , is the " cleanliness of the food . " <p> At Taqueria Sanchez , " The city comes , they check the temperature of the meats , it 's clean , it 's perfect , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks in Jefferson Parish . <p> Michael Lockhart , a medical representative , says he thinks the carts should be allowed to stay as long as the proprietors pay their taxes . They fill a need , he says , for travelers such as him , who eat on the run . <p> " It 's good and it 's quick , " says Lockhart , who stopped by a Taqueria Sanchez truck in Jefferson Parish to buy two pork tacos ( $3 ) . " I 'm on the road , and you do n't have time to go into a restaurant . " <p> Mobile food vendors in Jefferson Parish say that if the restrictions became too onerous , they may move a few miles away , to New Orleans , which has looser restrictions on food carts . That would create more competition for food carts such as Taqueria Los Poblanos . <p> At this mobile cart , much of the action happens between noon and 2 p.m . That 's when office workers take lunch breaks and Hispanic day laborers put down their hammers and nails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come every day , " says Jose Rasgado , who eats the beef tacos and gorditas , a meat-and-tortilla dish , at Los Poblanos . " For me , the taste is best , because ( other ) places do n't have the hot jalapeoos they have . " <p> Maria Jimenez and her husband , Miguel , moved from Houston to New Orleans  --  with their food cart  --  in May 2006 after hearing of a need for restaurants here after Katrina . Business has been much better than in Houston , where taquerias seem to occupy every corner , Maria says . But as more restaurants reopen after the hurricane and other taquerias arrive  --  a Taqueria Sanchez truck competes for customers across the street  --  business has slipped . <p> Los Poblanos serves about 150 customers a day , Maria says , compared with up to 300 last year . Miguel says he 's not too worried about business falling further if more taquerias move to New Orleans from Jefferson Parish , because the taqueria enjoys loyal customers . <p> His friend Jose Rios , 36 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fretting , either : " I was one of the first to sell tacos in this area . I 've been in the same place for a year and a half . People know where I am. "
