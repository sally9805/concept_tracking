SAN FRANCISCO  --  As it does for many these days , life feels a bit on the bleak side for Leanne Falise . Soaring heating bills have managed to pick off what luxuries she and her husband used to regularly enjoy , from dinners out to vacations . <p> But relief  --  however temporary  --  is on the way . She eyes a bag of Ghirardelli chocolates at the factory store here near the Bay , then smiles . <p> " This right here is a little luxury , something I can spoil myself with , " says Falise , an administrative assistant at an equipment-leasing company outside Pittsburgh , who is in town to help her daughter move . " Without this , I do n't have much to look forward to these days . " <p> The ailing economy is threatening to permanently kill the national buzz . The hundreds of thousands who have been laid off of late certainly have no intention of living the high life , and neither do those clinging to employment with shredded fingernails . Second homes , exotic getaways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What to do ? <p> Think small , like Casey Elliott . <p> She 's here picking up a tin of gourmet hot chocolate mix for her kids , a small but welcome treat at a time when her husband is out of work . " We 're trying to do simple things , like going for family walks and playing games , " she says . <p> From food to fashion , potions to pets , entertainment to e-commerce , Americans are finding modest ways to both buoy their spirits and maintain , even in cut-rate form , a version of those old free-spending days . <p> Brittany Curran , 22 , a Baltimore native now in the Coast Guard , says tough times means slashing cable TV channels at her onshore home . But she still lets herself splurge on 99-cent music downloads about a dozen times a month . " I still want to be entertained , but in smaller ways , " she says . " So maybe no $200 Wicked ( theater ) tickets , but a trip to a comedy club is OK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means never leaving home . <p> " I ca n't afford to get my nails done these days , but give me some time and Dawn dishwashing soap and soon I feel as pretty as the ladies in my office with $60 manicures , " says Perkins , a receptionist in Washington . " There are so many small ways to make yourself feel special . " <p> For her , that ranges from inviting friends over for dessert ( usually a dolled-up pound cake ) to showing her grandkids what fun meant in her day ( " I play Double Dutch and jacks with them all the time " ) . <p> Perkins says that if there 's a silver lining in the downturn , it 's the reminder of simpler  --  and perhaps happier  --  times . <p> " I have friends who make $100,000 a year and they 're complaining that they ca n't do this , they ca n't do that anymore , " she says . " We forgot that it 's fun to play cards and dominos . Or how about just something simple like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No meltdown for chocolate <p> As our passions shrink , businesses peddling a range of small treats are hearing registers ring . <p> " In hard times , chocolate is comforting and affordable , " says Fabrizio Parini , senior vice president of marketing at Ghirardelli , where 2009 sales are projected to surpass 2008 . Venerable confectioner Hershey 's also reported strong fourth-quarter sales , despite raising prices 10% in August . <p> " Chocolate does fine in a recession , even a premium brand like ours , " says Ghirardelli 's Parini . " Maybe our bar is double what someone else 's is , but we 're still talking about $4 vs. $2 . " <p> Other winners include companies that cater to our growing desire to stay home . Call it nesting , cocooning , fall-out sheltering , home is once again where the wallet is . <p> " People are looking for value-oriented ways to be entertained , " says Steve Swasey , vice president of communications for online movie rental giant Netflix , where subscriptions ( $4.99 a month and up ) are up 26% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch watching that DVD , how about some company ? Few things say home better than a pet , and not the purebred kind . <p> " President Obama saying that he will be getting a rescue dog for the White House could be big for us , " says Steve Zawistowski , executive vice president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . <p> He says that after 9/11 , the country " seemed to go big for meatloaf and mutts , " before returning to its big-spending ways . <p> " A year ago , a $1,200 Labradoodle might have sounded fine , " he says . " Not so much now . " <p> The need to fend off tough times with small comforts  --  whether laced with sugar or blanketed by fur  --  runs deep in human beings . <p> Little surprise that during the Depression , folks who literally could n't spare a dime would scrape together pennies to gather in darkened movie palaces and escape into the luxurious worlds of Busby Berkeley and Fred Astaire . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , things that reinforce your identity and keep you moving forward , " says Eric Almquist , head of global consumer insights at Boston-based consulting firm Bain &amp; Company , which recently produced a study called The Consumer of the Future . <p> Almquist says the world of Hummer-like indulgences has vanished overnight , replaced by more modest spending habits that may prove a boon to some companies . He cites the example of a few individual chocolates in elaborate packaging ; the consumer gets a small treat while the manufacturer can charge more per unit for the product . <p> " Ice cream , music , DVDs all will persist , " he says , noting that the Bain study found that " vice " purchases are still popular . British American Tobacco reported sales growth of 9% last fall , while spirits giant Diageo enjoyed a 6% bump last summer , just as the recession was taking hold . <p> What Almquist is less sure about is whether our newfound desire to think small will survive : " If the economy turns around in 2010 , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't , we may have our own Greatest Generation who will never forget what it 's like to make do with less . " <p> That future may already be upon us . For those Americans already prone to being frugal , today 's bleak fiscal outlook both reinforces their behavior and makes them feel a bit less alone in their habits . <p> Thrift is the new byword <p> Tracy Meadowcroft 's last three vacations consisted of trips with fellow church members to the Gulf Coast to help with rebuilding efforts . When it comes to spending , she does allow herself occasional trips to the hair salon and Starbucks , but now more than ever is redefining what it means to indulge . <p> " Do I have some extra money ? Yes , " says Meadowcroft , 27 , an editor at a Pottstown , Pa. , publishing company . " But it is n't for spending as much as it is to make me feel like I have what I need when the bills come due , or knowing if something happens to my car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treat is going out to a brewpub with her contractor fiance , and perhaps taking in a movie . " But mostly I take stock in what I have , not obsessing about what I 'm going to get , " she says . <p> Debbie Menger has always had simple definitions of what constitutes small luxuries . <p> Mainly it amounts to splurging on business-class upgrades whenever she and her husband travel overseas . <p> " Otherwise , our cars are old and our house is nice but small , " Menger says . " When we go out to eat , we like to get the two-for-one special . " <p> Menger and her husband are college professors in San Antonio . She acknowledges they could live far more extravagantly : Her husband 's family has deep roots in the community and gives its name to the Menger Hotel , a city landmark . But the couple 's longstanding modest ways are now en vogue , as evidenced by the crowds at one of her favorite local haunts , Goodwill , which receives donations from the Junior League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Menger , herself a Junior Leaguer . " You never know what you 'll find . Once , it was Chanel . " <p> The spoils are far less exotic at the Ghirardelli chocolate shop and cafe , though some of the packages do sparkle like bits of precious ore . <p> Holding on to a tin of powdered chocolate is Shahla Lorestany , who drove an hour from Sacramento to accompany her daughter on a school trip . A quick visit to Ghirardelli Square with fellow mom Elliott was a must . <p> " Buying a little something like this makes me feel good , " says Lorestany , who runs her own Farsi translating company . " It 's something small I can indulge the kids with . " <p> Standing by a sign buried under a small mountain of the sweet stuff ( " Factory Special : 30 chocolate squares for $19.95 " ) are Jim and Jerri Farrell of Key West . Jim ca n't pass up the deal . <p> " We both work hard and feel like we should still get what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate , " says the pharmacist , in town with his wife , a FedEx employee , to take in the sights of Chinese New Year . <p> Jim places two $19.95 bundles in his basket , 60 small life rafts capable of momentarily rescuing him and his co-workers from this Titanic of economic meltdowns . But Jerri gently persuades him to put one back . <p> " Do you know what a governor is on an engine , that piece that makes it not over-rev ? " Jim says with a smile . " Well , my wife 's my governor . " Little , cheaper things mean a lot <p> The nation 's economic collapse has given rise to more modest ways of indulging in life 's pleasures . " Excess is now a dirty word , " says Ted Mininni , trend-watcher and president of consulting firm Design Force in Marlton , N.J. " People are going back to basics .
