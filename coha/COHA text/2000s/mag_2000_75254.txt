This is Courtney Brown : Early in his freshman year at Penn State , Brown , a growing pup of a defensive lineman , needed some new clothes but did n't know where to go in State College to buy a shirt with a 20-inch neck and 42-inch sleeves . So his academic adviser , Don Ferrell , bought the clothes , delivered them and told Brown not to worry about reimbursing him right away . " No , " Brown said , " until I get the money from my mom , I wo n't take them . " // This is Courtney Brown : In a 1998 game against Michigan State , he sprinted around left end and blindsided Spartans quarterback Bill Burke , causing a fumble . It was one of Brown 's school-record 33 career sacks . " Greatest hit I 've ever seen , " says Nittany Lions linebacker and fellow All-America LaVar Arrington . " It looked like Burke was in a car accident . I probably could have recovered the fumble , but I was in awe . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , during his most important football season , the time in which his play would determine how high he would be taken in the NFL draft and thus how many millions he would sign for , Brown also had his most impressive academic term . His 3.40 average ranked 17th among the 133 football players , managers and trainers at Penn State . Most top prospects have dropped out of school to fine-tune for this weekend 's draft and what lies ahead , but graduation day seems as important to Brown as draft day . He 's still attending classes in three courses so he can graduate on time , on May 13 , with a degree in integrative arts and computer graphics . // This is Courtney Brown : When he finds out SI wants to take pictures of him in an academic setting for this story , Brown suddenly gets cold feet about a previously arranged interview . His agents persuade him to cooperate , but he wo n't allow himself to be photographed in a library or a classroom or with books because he does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks . He also wo n't allow the university to release the names of his professors , wo n't divulge the names of his courses and wo n't allow an interview to be conducted in his campus apartment . " You 're frustrated by Courtney , are n't you ? " Arrington says to a reporter . " You ca n't figure him out . That 's the way he likes it . He does n't want people to get a handle on him . " // Sorry , Courtney , but we 've got a pretty good handle on you : Principled , bright , excruciatingly reserved  --  and a superb football player who surely will be among the first three picks on Saturday . At a time when the off-field exploits of its players have been a source of embarrassment to the NFL , a prospect 's character has become as important a part of his r ? sum ? as his 40 time . In Brown 's case the character issue enhances his draft position . // The Cleveland Browns have the first pick in the draft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew Merletti , checks the backgrounds of about 200 potential draft choices a year . Brown came up clean . By last weekend the Browns had decided to make Brown the first selection , assuming the two sides can hammer out a deal before Saturday 's proceedings . Should Cleveland turn to Arrington , Brown would fall to the Washington Redskins , who pick second and third . " There 's not one thing we can find wrong with him , " says Redskins director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato . " With everything that 's happening in the NFL , he 's coming along at the perfect time . He 's almost too good to be true . " // Right man , right position , right time  --  even if his demeanor might be ill-suited to face the public demands that come with being the first pick . Cleveland is concerned but not scared off by Brown 's reticence . Over lunch last month in State College , Browns coach Chris Palmer told Brown two things : Cleveland would take a defensive player with the first selection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on a leadership role on defense , much the same way the Browns ' top pick in 1999 , quarterback Tim Couch , has done on offense . Moreover , Palmer told him that the club would make sure he received counseling on how to deal with the media . " His private nature wo n't be a big factor , " Palmer said last Thursday , as Brown wound up a two-day visit to Cleveland 's training facility . " You turn on the film and see him hunt down the quarterback and play with emotion . I see intensity . I like what I see . " // As do others around the league . " When I wrote my report on Courtney Brown , I said , ' This is the next Bruce Smith . I 'll bet money on it , ' " says John Wooten , the Baltimore Ravens ' assistant director of pro personnel . " The principle of building a team is , you get a quarterback first , and then you get the guy who can go after a quarterback . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the pass rusher. " // The 6 ' 5 " , 271-pound Brown is a remarkable physical package . He stunned scouts during an on-campus workout last month , when he ran a faster 40 time ( 4.52 seconds ) than the elastic , cat-quick 6 ' 3 " , 248-pound Arrington ( 4.55 ) , who until then had been viewed as quicker and faster than Brown and nearly as strong . ( Brown 's time was also faster than those turned in by the two top wideouts in the draft , Peter Warrick of Florida State and Plaxico Burress of Michigan State . ) Brown had a vertical leap of 37 inches to Arrington 's 36 . Brown bench-pressed 225 pounds 26 times , Arrington 20 . " I was talking to one scout after the workout , " says Penn State defensive ends coach Larry Johnson , " and he said it was the most amazing display he 's seen in his 19 years in the business . " Also , few prospects have had Brown 's 86-inch wingspan. // The NFL , however , is littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 Boston College defensive end Mike Mamula blew away scouts with his efforts at the NFL combine and skyrocketed to the seventh selection in the draft . But Mamula has never had more than 8 ? sacks in a season during his five years with the Philadelphia Eagles . Brown is presently too light to be a formidable run-stuffer  --  though in a couple of years he 'll carry 285 pounds  --  but should hold his own in a 4-3 scheme at left end , where Cleveland or Washington would likely use him . That would put Brown opposite the right tackle , generally the less skilled of the two offensive tackles , and the tight end . " No tight end will block him , " Cerrato says . // You do n't rack up 33 sacks and 70 tackles for losses in a big-time college program by being nothing more than a good workout guy . That Brown can leverage his unusual strength in game situations was evinced by a videotape that Johnson popped into a VCR last week , showing Brown bursting through and around larger linemen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit kids , and they walk out with chills up their spines , " Johnson says . " That 's the player they aspire to be . " // One play on the tape shows Brown , as a junior playing against Minnesota with a fractured thumb , double-teamed by a tackle and a tight end . As the tackle held Brown 's right arm , a running back joined the scrum . Still , Brown made a one-handed sack . Against Purdue last year Brown evaded the Boilermakers ' right tackle , pursued quarterback Drew Brees with his arms raised , deflected a pass , gathered in the ball for an interception and out-raced Brees for a 25-yard touchdown. // Last week Brown was clearly uncomfortable talking about himself . Each question was followed by a short response in his deep , quiet voice , followed by silence . This much an interviewer learns : Brown dislikes the notion that he has an edge in the draft because he has a stellar academic record and a spotless reputation off the field . When he arrived on campus from the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann , told Ferrell that if her son ever got behind in his schoolwork , she wanted him taken off the team . " It 's important to graduate , " Courtney says . " It 's one of the reasons I came to college . " // The too-good-to-be-true label bugs him too . " I 'm not claiming to be some perfect guy , " he says . " No one is perfect . I 'm just trying to be who I am . I 'm just doing what I 'm supposed to do . " // Brown also does n't think his reluctance to be a public figure is unusual . He believes his private life should be private . That 's why he would be a better fit with Washington than with Cleveland  --  the Redskins already have defensive stars in recently signed Bruce Smith and longtime Skins cornerback Darrell Green , with corner Deion Sanders expected to sign later this year . In Cleveland , Brown would become a person he never had to be in college , The Man on defense . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown . " All I can do is go wherever I 'm picked and give it the best I 've got . " // Sometime soon , Brown will sign a contract worth about $45 million , including a signing bonus of approximately $10 million . " Will that change you ? " he 's asked . Brown shifts in his chair , and then says , stone-faced , " I do n't know what to say about that . I 'll have to see what happens and act accordingly . " // Perhaps his reticence should be interpreted as another plus . Have n't there been enough players who talk a better game than they play ? Brown is a genuine person with a spotless reputation whose goal is to be the best player he can be . He plays the defensive position , the all-purpose end , that 's the hardest to fill . He just wants to show up , do his job and win . " The landscape in the NFL is n't good , " says Ferrell . " The league needs some good , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down some strong roots in Cleveland or Washington . Two days later he will be back in class . Rest assured , the NFL is looking forward to the Courtney Brown Era.
