1 <p> SAUSAGE IMMIGRANTS <p> Anna K. was not the only pale woman in a black shearling to glide along 108th Street in Rego Park , but she was the most striking . A Tajik shopkeeper , about to weigh a bag of unripe persimmons , paused in order to follow the course of Anna 's backside as it made its way down the block . <p> What set her apart from the others , at least in her own mind ? Her curls , for one  --  black , lustrous , caressing the bottom of her neck . Her green eyes , the color of leaves in midsummer . Her walk , perhaps , delicate , thought-through , her toes jutting slightly outward . The more observant man might notice the litheness of her torso , her proactive breasts , substantial hips , regal posture , a sharp , even precarious , gleam in her eye . <p> She walked by the Russian groceries , where women abused store proprietors over the price of sausages . Anna passed stores she had not entered in years . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , International Couture and Parisian Chic , with their mirrored walls , their fur-swaddled mannequins , their sequined gowns with padded shoulders . Their saleswomen , who swore that only the most fashionable women of Moscow , Paris , London were stepping out in this leopard-print pantsuit , that fur-collared ballerina dress . Whose skin was overmaquillaged , traces of foundation streaking their cheeks , their plump middles betraying an overindulgence in Stalin sausages . One of them , sporting a severe blond bun and a black apron , chain-smoked outside the front door , watching Anna as she walked past . <p> By the time Anna left Queens , she grew to detest those stores . But her dear mother would never renounce them no matter how many Longchamp bags Anna bought her . Her mother thought paying retail was for the very rich or the very foolish . Give her a good , crowded Daffy 's , squinting women ransacking blemished Italian cashmere , or a T.J. Maxx , with its hope of a decent Ralph Lauren handbag lying unmolested among the tangle of braided straps . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anna and her mother were considered " sausage immigrants . " <p> There they were , her parents , just nine blocks away from 108th Street on Sixty-third Road ( though in Queens , one must also take into consideration Sixty-third Avenue and Sixty-third Street and Sixty-third Drive , as if the effort of naming were quickly abandoned here ) , on the fourth floor of an eighteen-story building . Attached to their building was a desolate playground where Anna had played as a child , hoping a sympathetic soul would materialize to form the other half of a seesaw configuration . Later , in her teens , Anna could be found reading on the swings until her mother yelled out the window that it was time for dinner . <p> In the elevator , just press the number five , walk one flight down ( the elevator stopped only on odd-numbered floors ) , turn left , knock on the lemon-colored door , and voila , you 've reached the Roitmans ' ! <p> Her mother had already started planning the wedding ; as Anna walked in , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug , the names of family and friends scattered around her on little pieces of paper . " Table twelve , " she muttered , dooming several slips of paper to this particular fate . <p> Anna K. required no pleasantries at the door , no kisses , no interruption of routine . She had her own set of slippers in the hall closet ; they were pink chenille , worn down at the heel . She slipped off the shearling , releasing the scent of lavender , the fresh smell of outdoors mingled with Penn Station sweat . She had just seen off her fiancT , Alex K. , on a business trip to Philadelphia . <p> " Hello , Mamochka , " she said , giving her mother , then her father , a kiss . Papochka sat in his boxers on the living room couch , buried inside a Novoye Russkoye Slovo . His fingers were black with newsprint ; he thumbed through the paper in his white , stretched-out tank top , his rolled-up socks . <p> " Can you believe what 's going on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know that we have another Stalin and he has practically the same name ? " When not spearheading the demise of yet another unprofitable business venture , Papochka 's most sustained interactions were between himself and the paper , lovingly folded and chronologically filed away , only to be thrown out by Mrs. Roitman when he was n't looking . <p> " Nu i shto , Papa , we know , we know . " <p> The wedding would be at FabergT , the classiest Russian restaurant in Brighton Beach . The restaurant boasted that its dancers were all former Bolshoi Ballet corps ballerinas , although Anna believed they were shipped directly from Uzbek strip clubs . Only the best vodka for Anyechka 's wedding , it was already decided , none of that Smirnoff crap , only the best wine , one that costs more than $20 a bottle . For God 's sake , you ca n't go Loehmann 's on everything . <p> It was her turn now , Natasha Roitman 's , and how long she had waited for it to be her turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer about her daughter 's single status , her American , non-Jewish boyfriends ? Her beautiful Anna unhappy despite all her physical advantages , eyelashes that needed no curling , skin the color of coconut flesh , breasts that called attention to themselves , really they were lovely breasts , nothing at all like her own had been , lumpy and conical . Sure , they had had to work on those thick , snarling eyebrows and leg hair early in Anna 's life ; they had to buy her a first bra when she was only nine , but what teenage girl did n't have a few adjustments to make when transitioning into womanhood ? <p> And yes , Natasha could admit that Anna tended to stoop when she sat in backless chairs , like a drooping reed , her nose almost in her soup , and she did look thoroughly washed-out in browns and taupes and she could use a little teeth-whitening . And if she followed Natasha 's prescription of running a tea-infused ice cube over her eyes in the morning , all that puffiness around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been dyeing her gray hair for eight years now , Anna was in pretty good shape for thirty-seven . <p> On the carpet , the future Anna K. 's mother divided people , carefully arranging them into different strata of tables . The Manhattan Russians in the front , closer to the stage  --  the best seats in the house  --  followed by the Outer Boroughs Russians , the California Russians , the New Jersey Russians , and so forth . The Midwestern Russians would be squirreled away at the back tables . She did n't blame them , of course , but what could the poor dears do , with nowhere to go in the evenings , among all that snow and industrial soot ? How could they know you do n't wear turtlenecks to classy Brighton establishments ? Or even worse , taking that single " good " dress out of mothballs , forgetting one has worn it to countless birthdays and anniversaries and weddings , the same too-small " special occasion " dress , with its lacy arms , its mermaid shape , its matching fringe-heavy shawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna 's mother decided . <p> In the past , when Anna came to visit , her parents would put on the kettle for tea and ask her questions about the men she was seeing ; they would compliment a new blouse , a handbag . They would gossip about their circle of friends . How comfortable to come home , to have a permanent place at the table ! Now Anna could n't sit still ; she ran a paper towel under tap water and wiped dust off the bookshelves , caressing her old Austens and Hugos and Alcotts . She rearranged the framed black-and-white pictures on the top shelf : the three of them in Moscow , the studio portrait of eight-year-old Anna , proud in her Soviet school uniform  --  two years later she would no longer be Soviet . She dialed Alex 's cell phone . " Please leave message , " the voice mail demanded . <p> " This is Anna K. , " Anna said for the first time , trying it out . She pictured Alex on the train with his colleagues . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe , pressed between slices of cucumber on pumpernickel bread . She was jealous . Ever since she was a little girl , Anna had loved trains . <p> She still remembered the overnight trains from Moscow to Ukraine taken when she was a little girl , when she and her parents were going to visit her paternal grandparents . The excitement of the long voyage , the strong , bitter tea served in the dining car , the unfurling of a tin of black caviar , the fragrant smell of garlic . All she knew was that by the time she took the train back to Moscow , she would be changed by all the mysteries that greeted her on the other side . Listening to the villagers ' exotic Ukrainian accents and words , the simplicity of the local children 's games  --  hide-and-seek , mostly  --  laced with the fear that the resident Baba Yaga would scoop you into her burlap sack . Gathering mushrooms in the forest ( whoever found one would call out , triumphant , before dropping it into the wicker basket )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rising so early to play with the other kids that night still clung to the damp morning air . Drying blue currants under the hot sun , the berries spread out in rows on cots , the holes standing for each berry stolen , popped in the mouth . And then the train back to Moscow , couchettes beckoning like cocoons , and then , home with all the sweet pleasures of familiar routine . <p> " Once you find the right wedding dress , " her mother said from the rug , " write down the make and number . Masha will order it for you for half price from her store on Kings Highway . " <p> Anna watched her mother for a while , who murmured to herself as yet another table was completed . If there was a moment to say what was on her mind , to sit her mother down and say , Mamochka , you see , I 've been having some serious doubts ... , to squeeze her mother 's hand and wait for her to make it all right again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna was young , with a single wave of the hand , a hot bowl of mamaliga , and , poof , it was gone . If there was a single moment , a window to change her destiny , this might have been the time , still so early in the whole process , when her mother 's heart was not entirely invested in her tables , her linens , her vodka , her Masha , and that awful shop on Kings Highway , with its cheap , imitation Prada bags . Anna knew this was the time to speak , here with Mamochka and Papochka , the paper , the unbrewed tea in the kitchen . But from her vantage point in the chair watching the two of them , the gray invading their hair , all the extra girth and wrinkles they were carrying around ( Papochka especially in that tank top , the sagging folds of skin on his forearms , and what about Mamochka  --  the unnatural coral of her hair , her girdles ? ) , Anna found herself lacking the strength to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . That train had already passed . <p> Copyright @ 2008 by Irina Reyn <br> Continues ...
