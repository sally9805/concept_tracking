TRAVELER 'S NOTEBOOK Headnote Queen Elizabeth II was crowned fifty years ago , and all of England is celebrating her Jubilee . By Catherine Calvert // It 's Queen Elizabeth II 's Golden Jubilee , and across Great Britain , the celebrations of the fiftieth year of her reign have been under way for months , following the royal tradition of pullout-the-flags parties and parades that have greeted English kings and queens on such anniversaries since George III 's time . Elizabeth , the young woman who was known for her upright bearing , shy smile and dozens of shimmering gowns when she ascended to the throne , has become the grandmother with the difficult family and a wardrobe of hats for all occasions , ruling a nation that has tempered its enthusiasm for royalty . So this year 's celebration may differ from the 1977 Silver Jubilee , which marked her reign 's quarter century-then , there were cheering crowds , bunting-draped parades and 12,000 street parties , at which neighbors barbecued sausages and raised their glasses to her . This year of festivities for a queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of her sister , Princess Margaret ) and pleasure began quietly . Early this spring , palace courtiers were nervous about the lack of public enthusiasm , but since then , sentiment has seemed to be stirring . The prediction is that by this summer there will be a general cheer for this monarch , who takes a firm line regarding her duty , yet has accustomed herself to change and has never been an embarrassment ( unlike some of her relatives ) . By the early-June weekend that is the focus of the year 's celebrations , there should be some fervent choruses of " God Save the Queen , " as well as a bit of dancing in the streets . Since February , the queen herself has been ceremonially progressing through the country , snipping ribbons and watching parades . Meanwhile , London has had a face-lift , polished its jewels , and is ready to party-after all , the capital 's royal resident is planning to lead the revels herself . And the city has never looked better , with new restaurants , shined-up hotels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their new wings . If you visit this summer , you 'll spot a city with banners flying , guardsmen on review , fireworks spangling the air-and indulgent pleasures everywhere . The holiday weekend that begins June 1 is the time to be in London , as the queen launches four days of revelry and ceremony when she opens Buckingham Palace 's usually very private gardens for a classical concert that evening . Tickets are by lottery , but the concert will be shown on giant screens outside the palace and broadcast on TV . On the third , there 's a pop concert at the palace , also to be broadcast on giant screens throughout the city . Then the queen will light the first of the fiery beacons that will , by ancient tradition , be aflame across the commonwealth , from hilltop to hilltop . On the fourth , if you like your occasions large , thronged and trimmed in gold , you can catch the queen and her traditional windshield-wiper wave in a regal procession as she travels from Buckingham Palace to a service of thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glittering carriages and marching soldiers-all the queen 's horses and all the queen 's men . In the afternoon , she 'll visit the Golden Jubilee Festival in the Mall , a carnival with parades , music and all-round cheer . This is also the weekend to look for one of those street parties-or you can go to the Museum of London , which is holding its own on the fourth , with entertainers , fairground rides , food and bands . Many Londoners will be celebrating in the traditional way-in pubs , whose hours will be extended for the weekend . Though these June days and nights will be as bright as the beacons , other events , concerts and displays all over town are planned throughout the year , some revealing intimate glimpses of the queen , others just part of the general jubilation . At Kensington Palace , the queen 's wedding gown is on display ( May 1 , 2002 , to April 30 , 2003 ) , along with the wedding dresses of other royal brides.You can see the queen 's twinkling wedding tiara at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the museum gets out the sparklers with its exhibition of tiaras old and new-and do n't forget to visit the V &A's; new British Galleries , a sumptuous display of four hundred years of design , with cuttingedge museology ( lots of buttons to push and other things to touch ) . At the National Portrait Gallery , you can see Andy Warhol 's likeness of the queen , as well as other contemporary artists ' views . The most startling image , however , is at the handsome , newly refurbished Queen 's Gallery at Buckingham Palace . Here resides Lucian Freud 's byno-means-flattering new portrait of Elizabeth ( in which she resembles mashed potatoes wearing a crown ) . Make up your own mind , then revel in the unmatchable treasures collected by this queen and her ancestors , a regal assemblage indeed , with works by Van Dyck , Hals , Canaletto , Rembrandt , Holbein the Younger and Stubbs-and the modern artists Prince Philip favors . And at the Royal Academy this month , the queen has opened a newly remodeled entry courtyard that has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former U.S. ambassador to the Court of St.James 's , who has given a generous donation . The London String of Pearls Golden Jubilee Festival will bring in the crowds all year ; it is a celebration of the buildings and organizations that lie near the Thames , which will open their doors to reveal normally hidden treasures , from secret gardens to spectacular rooms . Prince Charles , that well-known architecture critic and the patron of the event , explained when he opened the festival that visits will provide a window on the institutions that , " in quiet , unsensational and lasting ways , underpin the fabric and structure of the world we have inherited . " The choices are mindboggling , whether you 're a new visitor to London or someone who knows the highways and back alleys of this fascinating city.You 'll have access to buildings that span the centuries : the stunning Victorian Durbar Court at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( open for tours on May 9 , June 8 and 15 , July 2 and 18 and October 8 and 15 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer ) and the Lord Mayor 's own Mansion House , first occupied in 1752 ( open on June 15 ) . There are special tours of the ageless Inns of Court ( June 16 and July 7 ) , for instance ; or join the Jubilee City Churches Walk and marvel at the work of Wren and Hawksmoor ( June 7 and 8 ) ; or have a goggle at the Jubilee commissions in gold and silver at the Goldsmiths ' Company ( until July 12 ) - just a sampling of the hundreds of treats , from lectures to concerts to collections , that allow an intimate look at the nation 's treasures . ( Check www. stringofpearls. org.uk and order the complete guide , so you do n't miss a thing . ) Looking for a royal souvenir , short of the Jubilee cocktail that the Dukes Hotel bar is serving or the Golden Jubilee Cup that the Guards Polo Club is offering as a prize ? Wedgwood and other fine English china companies will surely issue mugs-those they made for Queen Victoria 's Jubilee are great collectibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a gallery that specializes in monarchical souvenirs old and new . The handsomest present might be from Penhaligon 's ( 16 Burlington Arcade ) , which is offering a fragrance blending jasmine , lily and sandalwood , in a special bottle created for the Jubilee ( $391 ) . Or go shopping for a little something at the General Trading Company ( 2 Symons Street ) , the only general store that is permitted to carry the royal crest on its bags . The shop has long been one of the royal warrant holders , who 've gained official commendation for their wares and supply the palace and its occupants with everything from mole-catching services to handmade shoes . If you visit one of these royal purveyors , it 's like taking the queen 's own shopping list in hand . They include Asprey ( temporarily at 169 New Bond Street ) , where you 'll want to admire the jewels , and Arthur Sanderson &; Sons ( 233 Kings Road ) , for fabric-buy a cushion to take home . Find some Arthur Price butter knives at Fortnum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproof coats at John Lewis ( 278-306 Oxford Street ) ; then carry off some of the regal scents that the queen favors by stocking up on soaps and lotions by Bronnley ( at any chemist ) and Floris ( 89 Jermyn Street ) . Or collapse at the Ritz , the only hotel with a royal warrant-that of the Prince of Wales . ( It was at the Ritz , you may remember , that he introduced his consort , Camilla Parker Bowles , to the public at their first photo op together . ) Repair to the hotel 's new Rivoli Bar , a smart little watering hole that fronts on Piccadilly , for a restorative.You can also check in to one of thirteen luxury hotels in London offering the Jubilee Link throughout 2002 , a special package of two nights , with breakfast , tea and Champagne , at $710 for two.You can choose Claridge 's , the Connaught , the Dorchester or One Aldwych , among others . Then just lie back and think of England . Renewal is everywhere in London , with the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of pageantry and publicity , so her Jubilee pop concert on June 3 at Buckingham Palace will feature Aretha Franklin , the Queen of Soul , who will presumably set the royal toes tapping . The British , who , for better or for worse , have been redefining royalty and its place in their world , will , come June , agree : the jewel in the crown this time is surely the woman wearing it . <p>
