<p> As darkness approached off the South African coast on a splendid November day two years ago , Nick Price was an emotional wreck as he watched his Presidents Cup teammate Ernie Els entrenched in a sudden-death duel with Tiger Woods over three holes to determine a winner in the four-day event . <p> " It was the first time in my life I could relate to what my mother had always told me about how nervous she felt watching me play when I was growing up , " Price recalled in a telephone interview last week . " For the first time in my life , I was nervous for a teammate . I was chewing on my shirt . I was eating grass . . . . The intensity of it was almost too much to bear . " <p> In light so dim American team captain Jack Nicklaus said he could n't even see the ball from off the green , Woods drilled a 12-footer on the third playoff hole  --  " one of the best , if not the best putt I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his own five-footer to keep the teams tied . <p> At that point , Nicklaus and international team captain Gary Player decided they had seen enough . After conferring with their respective teams , the 2003 Presidents Cup was declared a draw . <p> The decision was hailed as a gesture of grand sportsmanship throughout the golf world , and the inconclusive result will serve as the backdrop for the sixth renewal of the matches starting Thursday at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville . <p> Nicklaus and Player will return as team captains , with many of the same players from 2003 also on their respective teams , including Woods , the No. 1 ranked player in the world . Els , still recovering from August knee surgery , wo n't play , but may attend if his doctors allow him to travel . <p> Nicklaus has since described that 2003 Presidents Cup as " the most fulfilling and enjoyable event I 've ever been involved with . " Player , a South African native , described it this week as " the most historic thing I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a new , true democracy there , and after being treated as the polecats of the world for so many years because of apartheid , it was a wonderful thing to see . " <p> Many believe that 17-17 tie in George , South Africa , also may well have elevated the Presidents Cup to a new , more prestigious level on the golf calendar . The PGA Tour runs the event , launching the inaugural Cup in 1994 , also at RTJ , where it 's been played three times . The two 12-man teams , representing the U.S. against an international side of players not eligible for the European team in the Ryder Cup , compete in a match-play format of two-man and singles matches . <p> PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said in 1994 the event was started because so many international stars , players such as Price of Zimbabwe , Greg Norman of Australia and Vijay Singh of Fiji , deserved a chance to play in a similar format to the Ryder Cup against the Americans . It also made good sense financially , adding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year when golf is usually an afterthought behind college and pro football and the pennant races in Major League Baseball . <p> Asked at the time about the inevitable comparison with the Ryder Cup , Finchem insisted the two events could stand alone , but that only the passage of time and the chance to develop its own distinct tradition would lift the Presidents Cup into the Ryder Cup 's " fifth major " status among the players , the public and the media . <p> Said Player , " It 's an event that will be bigger than the Ryder Cup because it entails the world . " <p> This week , more than 700 media credentials have been issued for the Presidents Cup , compared with 1,000 the PGA of America distributed last September for the Ryder Cup at Oakland Hills in suburban Detroit . At the last Ryder Cup in Great Britain in 2002 , a large number of American newspapers sent their golf writers abroad to cover the event . In South Africa , where the Presidents Cup drew huge domestic coverage , only a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here this week . <p> Still , 10 years and five Presidents Cup later , with the U.S. winning three , losing one and the teams tying two years ago , many players believe the Presidents Cup has narrowed the prestige gap , but that the two events still can not be considered equals . <p> " There 's no doubt the drama in South Africa was probably the best thing that could have happened to the Presidents Cup , " Woods said . " The two tournaments are totally different atmospheres . When we play the Presidents Cup , it 's basically like playing guys we face on the PGA Tour every week . When we play the Europeans , it 's different . Maybe half their team plays over here and we only see them in major championships , World Golf championships and the Players Championship . <p> " The international team , we see them week after week out here , so from that aspect there 's more camaraderie between the two teams . You certainly do n't have the animosity between the fans . When we play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryder Cup , there 's definitely some angst , not necessarily with the players , but certainly in the fans . " <p> The Ryder Cup began in 1927 as a competition to promote sportsmanship and goodwill between American players and golfers from the British Isles . <p> Through the first 25 tournaments , not much widespread attention was paid to the matches , mostly dominated by the U.S. side . From 1959 to 1977 , the American team won every match , save for a 16-16 tie in 1969 . Nicklaus , among others , convinced tournament organizers that expanding the British team to include players from Europe might make the event far more competitive , and in ' 79 that change was made . <p> Since 1985 , Nicklaus 's vision became reality . Europe has won six out of the last 10 Ryder Cups , and tied another in 1989 to retain the Cup it had won in ' 87 . It has also prevailed in four of the last five matches , including the worst drubbing ever inflicted against a U.S. team , the 181/2-to-91/2 pounding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ryder Cup was n't much until we lost it , just like the America 's Cup " in yachting , Davis Love III said . " Nobody really cared until we started losing it and then they started saying ' Wait a minute , why ca n't we win the America 's Cup ? ' I think it 's kind of like that with the Presidents Cup . We lost in Australia in 1998 and then we tied and everybody says , ' Wait a minute , a tie ? How does that happen ? ' <p> " I think the Presidents Cup is catching up . It 's not there yet . I think it 's all up to the players , how much importance do we put on it . But you saw a lot of guys this year grinding it out trying to make the team . " <p> Justin Leonard , one of Nicklaus 's two captains for the U.S. team this week , has played in both competitions . His 40-foot putt on the 17th hole against Spain 's Jose Maria Olazabal clinched the 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookline , Mass . It also touched off a controversial celebration on the green , before Olazabal had putted out , that left lingering bad feelings between both sides , perhaps the low point in terms of sportsmanship in the history of that competition . <p> " It 's tough to compare them , " Leonard said in Boston last month . " The Ryder Cup has a lot of history on its side , and the Presidents Cup is getting there , heading in the right direction . The Presidents Cup is a great event , but the intensity is not quite there . In my brief experience , once you get on the golf course , the intensity comes alive . But now . . . it 's not there yet . It 's one of those events where the crowds get into it , and then all of a sudden you get into it . You might enjoy the Presidents Cup a little more because there 's not the do-or-die pressure that you feel sometimes . " <p> Both team captains have emphasized , as Player said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . " <p> " I watched the Ryder Cup for many years , " Player said , " but I got disheartened when they said it was ' The War by the Shore ' at Kiawah Island in ' 91 . Do they know what a war is , compared to a golf match ? We do n't need all of that flag-waving . These are matches between allies , not enemies . Jack and I have insisted we do n't want any nasty talking . Let the clubs talk . If you win , you win , if you lose shake hands , look them in the eye and say , ' Well done . ' " <p> Norman , one of the driving forces in convincing Finchem to launch the Presidents Cup , also believes the event he played in three different times still has a way to go to catch the Ryder Cup . <p> " I think the Presidents Cup is a wonderful event . . . but I do n't think it will ever equal the history and tradition of the Ryder Cup , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much tradition that passed over the dam with the Ryder Cup for any team event to even think they could draw a parallel . History is hard to trump . I would n't mind seeing the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup joined into a truly international competition , but the PGA Tour , which operates the Presidents Cup , would have to concede some control , and I do n't think that 's likely to happen . " <p> Player likes it just the way it is and said he " strongly disagreed " with Norman 's notion of combining the two events . <p> " It 's a terrible idea , " he said . " It would not be good because the Ryder Cup is engraved in history . <p> You do n't change the U.S. Open or the British Open . I do n't think the pros want that . " <p> Price , Norman 's friend and former international teammate , also believes the Presidents Cup can stand on its own and is getting closer all the time to the Ryder Cup . He said another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further close the gap in the public perception of the two events . <p> " As long as it 's close , it will grow and grow in the public 's eye , " he said . " Golf has become more global , and I can tell you the awareness of it is so much greater in Australia , Japan , Africa . There 's as much support for it from the public . In South Africa , it was a huge success . <p> " It will take time , maybe another 20 years the Presidents Cup will be there . But it 's got to be close , backward and forward . I wo n't be there this week , but I 'll be watching on television . I really do hope it 's closely contested . Like everyone else , I want to watch great theater , and you certainly got that in South Africa . Just thinking about it gives you chills .
