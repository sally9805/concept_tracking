A Brief History of the Field of Learning Disabilities // * * * // Daniel P. Hallahan Devery R. Mock // Without a historical perspective , the uniqueness of present-day contributions and " discoveries " tends to be overemphasized . But in fact these contributions represent extensions , modifications , verifications , or duplications of previously observed phenomena or stated positions . Unless we use the past as points of reference and guides , investigators of learning disabilites may either recommit past follies or " rediscover " the contributions of their professional progenitors when they should instead extend and correct the works of those who pioneered before them . - Weiderholt ( 1974 , p. 1 ) // It is not easy to separate the wheat from the chaff , the sheep from the goat , or the contribution from the folly . In the field of learning disabilities ( LD ) , professionals are asked to make this distinction almost daily . Some contributions in the field extend previous research and shed new light on old problems , for example , the relationship between phonological awareness and reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries " are not so fruitful , for example , neurological patterning ( Delacato , 1966 ) . // Weiderholt ( 1974 ) suggested that the ultimate value of a " contribution " depends not on the persuasive power of its supporters but on the " contribution 's " relative place in history . Thus , to distinguish the proverbial wheat from chaff , Weiderholt argued for the " contribution " in its historical context . In so doing we look to the past , well beyond even the 1975 passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act ( EAHCA ) , to a history that spans centuries and continents . This history includes research investigating behaviors as disparate as aphasia and social competence and interventions ranging from Direct Instruction to forced laterality . It is a history that begins with the observed relationship between brain injury and behavior and progresses to and beyond the systematic identification of students with specific disability . In keeping with others who have chronicled these events ( Hallahan &amp; Mercer , 2001 ; Lerner , 2000 ; Mercer , 1997 ; Wiederholt , 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of LD into several periods . We have chosen to use the periods suggested by Hallahan and Mercer ( 2001 ) : European Foundation Period ( c. 1800-1920 ) ; U.S. Foundation Period ( c. 1920-1960 ) ; Emergent Period ( c. 1960-1975 ) ; Solidification Period ( c. 1975-1985 ) ; Turbulent Period ( c. 1985-2000 ) . Individually these periods illustrate the interests , theories , and tools of the field at various points in time . Collectively , these periods evidence progress and serve as guides for distinguishing the contribution from the folly . // European Foundation Period ( c. 1800-1920 ) // During this period , some European physicians and researchers explored the relationship between brain injury and behaviors , primarily disorders of spoken language . Later , in the second half of this period , this research gave way to investigations concerning presumed brain abnormalities and disorders of reading . Many of the achievements of this period , although limited by 19th-century technology , remain seminal achievements in the field of LD . The work of individuals such as Gall ( Gall &amp; Spurzheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hinshelwood ( 1895 , 1917 ) , however flawed and limited by the technology of their time , serve as the very " points of reference and guides " that Wiederholt ( 1974 ) extolled . // One of the first individuals to explore the relationship between brain injury and mental impairment was a physician named Franz Joseph Gall . Prior to Gall , the brain was viewed as " a single organ from which flowed vital energy under the influence of the will into all parts of the body " ( Head , 1926 , p. 3 ) . Based on his observations of patients with brain injury , Gall asserted that separate areas of the brain controlled specific functions . Sir Henry Head , in his classic two-volume work on aphasia , paraphrased a letter published in 1802 describing Gall 's assertions : // The apparently uniform mass of the brain is made up of organs which subserve the manifestations of our vital and moral faculties ; these consist of three groups : ( 1 ) those which concern purely the exercise of vital force ; ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) the intellectual qualities of the mind . Each of these is localised in a different portion of the brain . The organ of the vital force resides in the brain stem .... The inclinations and affections of the soul belong to the basal ganglia , whilst the intellectual qualities of the mind are situated in various parts of the cerebral hemispheres . Hence the moral and intellectual characteristics can be deduced from measurements of the skull , which is modified by the underlying brain . ( 1926 , pp. 4-5 ) // As Head noted , the letter summarizing Gall 's discoveries contained two themes-one related to the revolutionary idea of localization of function in the brain , the other to what was to become the basis for what was called " craniology " or " phrenology . " Unfortunately for Gall , his name became more associated with phrenology than with his discovery of localization of brain function . By the middle of the 19th century , he was considered a charlatan within the medical community . // According to Head , Gall also missed the mark with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as Broca 's aphasia . He was the first to describe cases of speech loss based on injury to the left frontal lobe . However , // although many instances came before him , he appears to have looked upon them as confirmatory of a localization of faculties determined on other grounds . For him normal speech was due to the perfect exercise of certain aspects of memory , each of which was situated in some particular part of the anterior lobes of the brain .... // Gall ... appears to have looked upon speech as the direct mechanical expression of the concepts , inclinations , feelings and talents of man , each of which he localized in a particular part of the brain . ( 1926 , p. 11 ) // Beginning in the 1820s , John Baptiste Bouillaud , dean of the Medical School of the College of France , performed autopsies of patients with known brain injury . This work confirmed Gall 's notion of localization of brain functioning . Bouillaud posited that movement and sensory perception were controlled in the cortex of the brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Broca used autopsies to further Bouillaud 's work and concluded that speech functions actually reside in the inferior left frontal lobe , an area that would later be named Broca 's area . His name also became linked to a particular type of slow , laborious , dysfluent speech-Broca 's aphasia. // In 1874 , Carl Wernicke published a book containing 10 case studies of brain-injured patients with language disorders . These patients had fluent speech , but often it was devoid of meaning . In addition , these individuals manifested difficulty in recognizing and comprehending words . Wernicke labeled this disorder " sensory aphasia . " With time , this particular type of aphasia as well as the area of the left temporal lobe responsible for the disorder would bear Wernicke 's name . // As research in language disorders progressed , interest developed in disorders related to reading . In 1872 , Sir William Broadbent published an account of six cases of persons whose histories supported the idea that speech and language is controlled by the left frontal lobe . One of these cases was that of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name familiar objects while retaining the ability to write and converse . Later in 1877 , Adolph Kussmaul reported on observations made by van den Abeele , which left " little room to doubt that a complete text-blindness may exist , although the power of sight , the intellect , and the power of speech are intact " : " A woman , forty-five years of age , was struck with apoplexy while in the enjoyment of the most blooming health .... Two months after the attack she discovered that she could no longer read printing and writing . She saw the text , distinguished the forms of the letters , and could even copy the text , but was incapable of translating words into spoken words and thoughts " ( 1877 , p. 776 ) . Kussmaul attached the label " word-blindness " to this specific brand of reading disability . // In 1884 , Berlin , a German ophthalmologist , introduced the term , " dyslexia . " He believed " dyslexia " was preferable to " word blindness " for a condition of neurological origin ( Anderson &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin presented six cases of adults with dyslexia , each of whom had lost the ability to read even though each had normal language ability ( Berlin , 1887 , cited in Anderson &amp; Meier-Hedde , 2001 ) . // In 1896 , W. Pringle Morgan , an English physician , published the first case study of a child with congenital word-blindness . A French physician , John Hinshelwood , inspired by the work of Morgan and others , studied a particular patient from 1894 to his death in 1903 . Upon performing the autopsy , Hinshelwood located the cause of the reading disability in the left angular gyrus . In 1917 , Hinshelwood published Congenital Word-Blindness , a volume in which he noted the disproportionate number of males with this disorder and posited the potential heritability of congenital word-blindness . In addition , Hinshelwood asserted that the primary area of disability was faulty visual memory for words and letters . For this reason , he recommended one-to-one training designed to increase visual memory for words . // U.S. Foundation Period ( c. 1920-1960 ) // By 1918 , all states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this period , one relatively comparable to Weiderholt 's ( 1974 ) " transition phase , " begins as teachers across the United States attempted to affect widespread literacy . Consequently , researchers in this period moved beyond observing and explaining abnormal behavior . Instead , many found themselves working with children in educational settings where remediation , not etiology , became the focus . Out of necessity , these researchers built on the work of their European predecessors and developed diagnostic categories , assessment tools , and remedial interventions that would influence future practice . Not surprisingly , much of this work was focused on reading disability . // In 1921 , Grace Fernald coauthored an article describing remedial reading practices that had been used with students at the UCLA Clinic School ( Fernald &amp; Keller , 1921 ) . In this article Fernald advocated for an emphasis on teaching the reading and writing of words as wholes using a technique that integrated several sensory modalities including visual , auditory , kinesthetic , and tactile ( VAKT ) . As rationale for this procedure , Fernald ( 1943 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinesthetic modality . These references included Plato , Horace , Quintilian , Charlemagne , and Locke . To her credit , Fernald kept extensive records of student progress , and although she did not conduct research with the methodological rigor expected today , she was able to report notable performance gains in the areas of reading , spelling , penmanship , foreign language , and arithmetic . // Samuel Torrey Orton , the father of the International Dyslexia Society ( formerly Orton Dyslexia Society ) , worked as a neuropathologist at the State Pychopathic Hospital in Iowa City , Iowa . In this capacity , Orton participated in a 2-week mobile clinic for students with learning problems where he made observations regarding students with low academic achievement , many of whom had low reading achievement . Of the 14 students in the clinic referred for reading problems , most demonstrated IQs in the near-average to above-average range , which led Orton to hypothesize that IQ was not always reflective of true intellectual capacity , especially in students with reading deficits-a view shared by many present-day reading researchers ( Siegel , 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Writing , and Spelling Problems in Children ( Orton , 1937 ) . // Although Orton built on much of Hinshelwood 's work , he came to disagree with his predecessor on numerous points . Orton believed that the prevalence of reading disability was much higher than Hinshelwood 's 1 per 1,000 , perhaps even as high as 10% of the total school population ( Orton , 1939 ) . In addition , Orton ( 1939 ) maintained that the skill of reading involved more areas of the brain than the angular gyrus . He put forth the theory of mixed dominance , wherein the brain stored mirror images of visual representations . Students with reading disabilities lacked cerebral dominance and were therefore unable to suppress these stored , mirrored representations . Mixed dominance therefore resulted in reversals of letters and words in both reading and writing . He labeled this phenomenon " strephosymbolia , " explaining that students with reading disabilities were not blind to words ; instead , they " twisted " the symbols comprising words . Although Orton 's work would later perpetuate the myth that individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enduring legacy in remediation practices . He stressed the need for explicit phonics and blending instruction using a multisensory approach . This practice is explained in Remedial Work for Reading , Spelling , and Penmanship ( Gillingham &amp; Stillman , 1936 ) , a reference guide that has recently been published in its eighth edition . // Orton 's research associate in the mobile clinic was Marion Monroe . After taking a position at a facility for delinquent boys with mental retardation , the Institute for Juvenile Research , Monroe developed a synthetic phonetic approach to the teaching of reading . She published her experiments in the book Children Who Can not Read ( Monroe , 1932 ) and later went on to train teachers in several field-based projects in areas around Chicago . Like Fernald , Monroe published studies lacking methodological rigor by today 's standards ; however , she did report impressive achievement gains in reading . // Monroe , like Orton , bequeathed to the field of LD educational practices that affected progress in years to come . For example , Monroe pioneered the practice of calculating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of reading achievement for a student . Using this index , she could identify students who needed specific assistance . //
