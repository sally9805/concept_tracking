What do these two actors , three politicians and four musicians have in common ? They all took the stage in 2006 and got us talking . But it was n't always for the right reasons . Not all these performances are to be admired , but they are sure to be remembered . <P> JESSICA SIMPSON got so flustered at the Kennedy Center Honors as she was singing 9 to 5 to Dolly Parton that she stopped midway and fled the stage  --  hardly an argument for women in the workforce . <P> MICHAEL RICHARDS , a.k.a . Seinfeld 's Kramer , lit into a heckler during his stand-up act , calling him a " nigger , " joking about lynching and proving that as far as racist rants go , drunken anti-Semitism ( la Mel Gibson ) is so last season . <P> JOHNNY DEPP , as Captain Jack Sparrow , steered critically disliked Pirates of the Caribbean II to the biggest opening-weekend take ever : $132 million . A royalty check to Keith Richards ' personality is in the mail . <P> THREE 6 MAFIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rappers gave the night 's most energetic song performance  --  It 's Hard Out Here for a Pimp , from the film Hustle and Flow . Then they won for Best Song , which led host Jon Stewart to observe , " Martin Scorsese , zero Oscars . Three 6 Mafia , one . " <P> JOHN KERRY does n't want you to get stuck in Iraq . I mean , get us stuck in Iraq ! The vet botched his anti-Bush punch line , making it sound antimilitary . Kids , if you ca n't tell a joke right , especially during elections , do n't tell it at all . <P> JIM MCGREEVEY , the former New Jersey Governor , was the most contrite of Oprah 's celebrity apologizers . Two years after saying " I am a gay American , " he talked tactfully about his trysts , even though he was n't promoting a book . Oh wait , he was . <P> PERVEZ MUSHARRAF , President of Pakistan , charmed the media  --  including a hilarious stop on The Daily Show  --  while promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guess he takes those assassination attempts with a sense of humor .
