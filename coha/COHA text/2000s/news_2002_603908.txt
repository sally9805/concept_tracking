<p> CHICAGO  --  Connie Payton planned to have a " chill-out " day . It was Nov. 1 , exactly three years to the date that her husband , Chicago Bears icon Walter Payton , succumbed to liver cancer . <p> If there was a time to clear the calendar and keep to herself , this breezy Friday would have fit the bill . <p> But there was too much to do . <p> There 's a book to promote , a toy drive , a speech , interviews and a signing party . And the day would n't end until she took her turn as " Coach of the Night " for daughter Brittney 's high school cheerleading squad . <p> " Before I gave a speech this morning , I said to myself , ' OK , this is a good day . I 'm not going to cry , ' " she said . " But I 've got to admit , at one point when I said , ' November 1st , ' it brought a tear . But it was n't sadness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' We could choose on this day for the rest of our lives to be sad , or we could celebrate it . We have a choice with how we look at life , how we accept things . I think we have a reason to celebrate . ' " <p> Meet Connie Payton , a courageous , straight-shooting vibrant woman with old-fashioned morals who , in the aftermath of her husband 's death , has chosen a high-profile existence as a philanthropist . <p> Naturally , reminders of Walter Payton are ubiquitous in Chicagoland , where there is a high school named for the Bears great , a restaurant with a museum bearing his name and a suburban street , Walter Payton Way , among other tributes . But what hits home like nothing else is when she sees 34  --  Payton 's uniform number . <p> " It pops up at the weirdest times , " she said . " It 's like , ' Are you letting us know you 're still around ? That you 're OK ? ' " <p> The day after Dallas Cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Connie called the Smith residence to congratulate him . Smith 's wife , Pat , told Connie that the No. 34 had popped up again  --  flashing on Smith 's answering service . Smith had 34 messages waiting . <p> " Emmitt said that it was Walter , giving him a sign , " Connie said . " That brought tears to my eyes . It gave me goose bumps . " <p> Happy for Smith <p> Connie Payton hardly is disappointed that her husband 's signature record was broken by Smith ( another Payton mark , for career combined yards , was broken by Oakland 's Jerry Rice on Monday ) . <p> " It does n't take one thing away from what Walter accomplished , " she said . " Walter knew it would eventually happen . It was just a matter of who . We thought it would be Barry ( Sanders ) . " <p> That Smith broke the record seemed fitting , Connie said . She admires his determination as an athlete and character off the field  --  traits often associated with Payton . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bond through an unusual circumstance . It was Sept. 11 , 2001 , and Payton , in town on foundation business , sat in a hotel room horrified by the terrorist attacks . <p> Before long , Smith , whom she had met a day earlier , called to offer comfort . <p> " I ended up spending that whole day with Emmitt and his family , and they were wonderful , " Payton said . " It was the type of thing where I felt like I had known them for a long time . You never know what life will bring . " <p> Doing what is necessary <p> After the tragedy of losing her husband , Connie Payton has become committed to making an impact on those dealing with cancer . Through the Walter Payton Cancer Fund , she aims to raise $ 10 million for research . In June 2000 , she was on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers to support a less-traditional approach to treating cancer with the use of integrated medicines . And her new book , Stronger Than Cancer , is a compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals  --  including Connie , Brittney and son Jarrett . <p> Each year , nearly 1.3 million in the USA are diagnosed with some form of cancer . <p> " Sometimes you really do n't see that glimmer of hope , " Payton said . " That light is not there . You do n't think that you can get through it . It 's sad that people have to take that journey . Thank goodness , a lot of people come out on the winning side . We did n't , but there 's still a lot to learn from it  --  and a lot to share . <p> " That 's why I really liked Brittney 's story . You never realize how much people are hurt , but for a kid her age going through something like that , you hope they can read it and be enlightened and really feel , ' Hey , I can make it though this , too . ' " <p> Payton said support from family and friends  --  a driving focus of the book  --  should not be underestimated . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorated and after his passing . So was faith in God . <p> " If I did n't believe that Walter , as sick as he was , that once he died there was a better place for him where he 's whole again with no more pain , and we 'll someday see each other again . . . If I did n't have that to hold onto , it would have been difficult , " said Payton , who met Walter on a blind date as a high school senior . <p> " And that was critical for Walter , too . Even when you knew there was nothing else to do , you just kept believing and never gave up hope that things would be fine  --  whichever way they ended up . He had lost so much weight . If you just looked at the physical , it was very discouraging . You wanted to just throw your hands up and forget it . But because of faith , it 's ' OK , God . I trust you . So what do we do today ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO of Cancer Treatment Centers of America , remembers meeting Connie and Walter in early 1999 . He saw a husband in obvious pain and a take-charge wife trying to provide comfort as they checked into the facility in Zion , Ill . <p> It did n't take long for Cary to develop a bond with the Payton family and since Walter 's death to realize Connie 's burning desire to fight cancer . <p> " What she 's doing is unbelievable when you think of the trauma of losing a spouse , " said Cary , who accompanied Connie in testifying on Capitol Hill . " But Connie is using this as an opportunity to make it better for someone else . She 's so brave . I 'm sure Walter is smiling from ear to ear , to see what she 's doing . " <p> While she fights cancer on one hand , Connie reaches out to help needy kids with the other . She started the Walter and Connie Payton Foundation to continue the mission of a foundation established by Walter , benefiting neglected and abused children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is knee-deep into a Christmas toy drive . Payton hopes to provide gift bags to 26,000 kids . <p> " A lot of people thought she would n't be able to move on and do things after my dad 's death . But she has , " Jarrett Payton said from the University of Miami , where he is a senior running back for the undefeated defending national champions . <p> " I always knew my mom had it in her . But with the aura my dad had , you could kind of get lost in the background . My mom always did the dirty work , taking care of me and Brittney . But now you ca n't help but notice the respect she gets when she 's out and about . " <p> Touching moments <p> More than 200 well-wishers flowed through a lunchtime book-signing session at a downtown department store , and the vibe was uplifting . Several shared anecdotes about Walter , expressing how he touched their lives . Rarely does a day pass when she does n't hear something new that illustrates the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness , " she said . <p> During a recent signing , a man asked her to sign the book to his son , Payton . <p> " A lot of times , I 'm in awe , knowing how people really felt , " she said . <p> At one time , Connie Payton never envisioned becoming such a public figure that her book tour will hit 12 cities through early December . She wistfully recalled when her children were younger and she played the role of typical suburban mom  --  being a " room mom " at school and driving kids to field trips and athletic events . <p> " I was driving and complaining every mile of the way . . . but loving it , " she remembered . " I 'm missing all of that now that they are older and independent . " <p> Still , it was an easy decision to embark on her current track because , well , somebody needed to do it  --  though the transition was n't automatic for a self-described homebody . <p> " At the beginning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spot , " she said . " Everything happened so quickly . It 's like Walter left and now it 's me . But we 're doing fine . We 're keeping Walter 's legacy alive . We 're living life the way he would want us to live it : Not taking anything for granted . Being there for each other as family . And just doing things that we hope will touch other people .
