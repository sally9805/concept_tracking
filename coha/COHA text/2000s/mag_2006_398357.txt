Section : Special Report America 's Best Leaders <p> PATRICK LAWLER : Youth Advocate <p> Patrick Lawler sounds every bit the corporate bigwig as he points to bar graphs illustrating his organization 's success . " These are our 10 core indicators , " he explains in his well-appointed office . Except Lawler is n't talking about sales and revenues , profit and loss . As the chief executive officer of Youth Villages , a nationally recognized nonprofit for emotionally and behaviorally troubled children , Lawler is counting far different data . Indeed , the statistic he calls his " top selling point " is a deeply human one : the status of children one year after their release from the program . <p> Employing a combination of business savvy and decades of experience in youth counseling , Lawler has built a program for the children others deem too difficult to handle . " We take the kids nobody wants , " says Lawler , 51 , explaining that the children , the majority of whom have been physically or sexually abused , arrive with problems ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics he monitors so carefully , his program is working : 80 percent of children who receive treatment from Youth Villages are still living at home , going to school , and doing well even two years after discharge . In contrast , up to 70 percent of children nationwide who have received treatment through government programs wind up returning to government care within one year of their release . <p> Because it is built around treatments that emphasize hard evidence of success , Lawler 's program has surged to the front lines of children 's mental health services . " It is the latest , and clearly the most effective , service model , " says Linda O'Neal , executive director of the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth . " He has set a standard and challenged other service providers to think about what they do and whether the service models they use are the best . " Based in Memphis , Youth Villages now serves 11,000 children and their families per year . <p> The success of Youth Villages goes back to a moment about 13 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of youth services-removing children from their homes for treatment-was n't working . " In the early years , we thought we were in the business of raising other people 's kids , " Lawler says . " But many kids were not doing well after they left us . " Amid the search for answers , Lawler and his staff discovered the multisystemic therapy model , which was developed by Scott Henggeler of the Family Services Research Center at the Medical University of South Carolina . The model was designed to help antisocial children by stressing an intensive , holistic approach that treats the family as well as the child . Lawler and his staff became the first U.S. practitioners to launch MST on a large scale . <p> The home-based care model is now used in 30 states and 10 countries . " Lawler was able to project into the future and see the implications of new treatment technologies , " says Henggeler . " That type of thinking has the potential to unbelievably improve outcomes for children . " <p> Stand tall . Lawler 's suburban Memphis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has spent his 33-year career . After high school , he took a job as a counselor at Tall Trees , a Shelby County youth guidance school . " I was drawn to the most troubled kids , " he says . " They seemed to have so much life and energy , just like me , but they lived these horrible childhoods . " Tall Trees ' director , William Key , said he first recognized Lawler 's tenacity when he coached him on the football field . " He was a tall , skinny kid . But he was extremely eager to get an opportunity to move himself along , " says Key , now the criminal court clerk for Shelby County . " He is a go-getter . He would be the first on the pileup . " <p> While earning degrees in criminal justice and counseling from the University of Memphis , Lawler worked at various jobs , including as a probation counselor at the Shelby County Juvenile Court . When county officials considered shutting down a poorly performing residential treatment center , Key recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to save it . Lawler was the third director to take a stab at the job that year . He soon realized the enormity of his task . " I knew nothing about administration , had never seen a balance sheet , and did n't know we needed a license , " he says . " We started with a $150,000 budget and one typewriter . And the " K " key stuck . My dream was a copy machine . I could tell you how many rolls of toilet paper we gave to each dormitory . " <p> Under Lawler 's leadership , however , the program , Dogwood Villages , thrived . Operating on just a few hours of sleep per night , he worked weekends and holidays . He often mowed the grass himself . In 1986 , Dogwood Villages merged with Memphis Boys Town to become Youth Villages . <p> Along the way , Lawler learned some important lessons about the business world . " I thought we were supposed to be a charity , " he says . " We ran on a shoestring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and a reserve . " The organization 's annual revenues have risen from $900,000 in 1986 to more than $90 million in 2006 , thanks in large part to government contracts . Today , about half of its revenue comes from the state of Tennessee . The nonprofit now has more than 1,300 employees in 40 locations across Tennessee , Mississippi , Alabama , Arkansas , Texas , North Carolina , and Washington , D.C. <p> A significant ingredient in Lawler 's success attracting millions of dollars each year in private contributions , his colleagues say , is his personality . " He oozes charisma , " said Ken May , president and CEO of FedEx Kinko 's and a member of the Youth Villages board . " He has the ability to reach inside someone and make them feel comfortable . " Several of Lawler 's colleagues added that he has an uncanny ability to hire the right people for the right jobs , listen to them , and implement their ideas . <p> To be sure , Lawler gets some ribbing for his abundant energy and attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lawler tried to institute a strict nutritional plan in the centers , focusing on low-fat food and limited second helpings . " At one point , I had only skim milk " at the facilities , says Lawler , a married father of two . " But the staff got on me about it . . We went to 2 percent . " <p> Lawler also has a tendency to see potential where others might see trouble . That was the case for former foster child Melanie Jackson , who entered Youth Villages at age 12 . " People tend to think that with so many odds against you , you will fall into the category of negative outcomes , " said Jackson , now 26 . " Lawler looked at me as more than a foster child-as a young person who could have a bright future ahead of herself . " Jackson just earned a master 's degree in public administration ; Youth Villages paid her way . " For him to believe in me , " she said , " it just kind of blew me away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youth Villages founder Patrick Lawler visits the Bartlett campus in Memphis . <p> By Samantha Levine <p>
