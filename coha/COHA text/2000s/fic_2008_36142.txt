I cover my ears , I close my eyes , <p> Still I hear your voice , and it 's tellin ' me lies ? . ? . ? . <p> <p> My singing does n't inspire thousands of fans to emit screams of delight , but I was a trifle hurt when my dog jumped up with a howl and streaked for the stairs . Usually he likes my singing . He 's the only one who does like my singing . Otherwise his hearing is pretty good . <p> John was coming down the stairs . He halted Caesar 's headlong rush with a peremptory order  --  something I 've never succeeded in doing  --  and sauntered toward me . <p> I had n't seen him for two weeks . My toes went numb . He was wearing a blue shirt that matched his eyes and those of the Siamese cat draped over his shoulder . One of his hands supported Clara 's front end , his long fingers as elegantly shaped as the small seal-brown paws they held . Clara had not cared much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win her feline heart ( the alternative being bites and scratches ) and he had succeeded , with the aid of frequent offerings of chicken . They looked sensational together . He looked sensational . <p> So I said grumpily , " Right on cue . Why ca n't you come in the front door like normal people instead of climbing up to my bedroom window ? " <p> " It brings back such fond memories . " <p> Memories of the time when Interpol and a variety of competing crooks had been looking for him and the art treasures he had made off with . He was now a respectable antiquities dealer , if I could believe him . Which I probably should n't . Tellin ' me lies had been one of his favorite activities . <p> I picked up the grubby wad of white yarn and the crochet hook precariously attached to it , which I had dropped onto my lap , and pretended to study it . Playing it cool , so as not to be beguiled by the winsome smile and melting blue eyes . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . London is less than two hours from Munich by air . I should know , I 'd made the trip often enough . Thanks to an indulgent boss I could get away from my job at the museum more easily than John could get away from his antiques business . Or so he claimed . Tellin ' me lies ? <p> " So how 's business ? " I inquired . <p> No answer . A thud and a loud Siamese complaint made me look up . Clara was on her feet  --  at HIS feet , glaring at him , and John was ? . ? . ? . ? not glaring ? . ? . ? . ? staring at me with a look of glazed disbelief . No , not at me . At the misshapen object I held . <p> " What is it ? " he croaked . <p> " You need n't be so rude , " I said defensively . " It 's a baby cap . I 'm not very good at crochet , but I 'll figure it out eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed into it . He was white as a sheet , a lot whiter than the mangled little cap , which had suffered from Clara 's occasional attempts to play with it . <p> " What the hell is the matter with you ? " I demanded . " Bob  --  you know , my brother Bob  --  his new wife is expecting her first and I thought it would be a nice gesture if I ? . ? . ? . ? if I ? . ? . ? . " <p> He let out a long gasp of air , and then it hit me . Like a sock in the solar plexus . <p> " Aaah , " I said . " Aha . Sometimes I am so slow . Is that what you thought ? That is what you thought ! Not only that I was about to become a mummy but that I  --  wait a minute , it 's coming , I 'll get it eventually  --  that I had got myself pregnant in order to trap you into unholy wedlock . And the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a bitch ! I 'll bet your mother has been hinting for months , ' Watch out for that worthless trollop , she 'll try to  --  ' ? " <p> " Vicky ! " His voice is usually a mellifluous tenor , but he can outshout me when he has to , and believe me , he had to . He jumped up and came toward me . I threw the baby cap , complete with crochet hook , at him . He ducked . The ball of yarn rolled off the couch and Clara went in pursuit . John grabbed me by the shoulders . <p> " Stop yelling and listen to me . " <p> " You did , did n't you ? Believe it . " <p> " Believe what ? That you 'd be dim enough to pull an antiquated stunt like that one ? Never in my wildest fantasies . But you must admit my initial impression was justified by the evidence available to me at the time . " <p> " Stop talking like a lawyer . It was n't what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified you . You looked as if you were about to pass out . " <p> " Yes . " <p> I was gearing up for a loud , satisfying fight , but that quiet-voiced confession took the wind out of my sails . The best I could come up with was a feeble " So you admit it . " <p> " I may be all the things you called me and more , but I 'm not so complacent as to be blind to the consequences of my own misdeeds . Bloody hell , Vicky , I 'm terrified all the time ! Admittedly I 'm one of the world 's most flagrant cowards , but I 'm also afraid for you . There are a lot of people in the big bad world who hate my guts and who harbor grudges . " The words came spilling out , his face was flushed and his fingers bit into my skin . " When we agreed to be together , I tried to talk you out of it . I put you in danger simply by associating with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were an adult and it was your choice . You convinced me against my better judgment , and the few remaining shreds of my conscience . How do you suppose I felt , for one ghastly moment , when I thought there might be another hostage to fortune , a helpless , totally vulnerable , completely innocent potential victim of my various sins ? The people I 'm referring to would n't feel the slightest compunction about using a child to get back at me  --  and you . " <p> <br> Continues ...
