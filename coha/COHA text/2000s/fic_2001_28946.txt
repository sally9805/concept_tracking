I had told Perry when I gave him the book that there seemed to be more to this story , but I thought that perhaps I should stop while I could still lift the manuscript . Being a good agent , Perry emerged with a three-book contract . After that . . . well , after that , things got out of hand , and here we are , eight years later . So where are we , exactly ? As I said above , I do n't write with an outline -- if I knew what was going to happen , it would n't be any fun to write the book , now , would it ? However , as I go along , merrily gluing pieces together , I do sometimes get a vague idea as to some events that may take place in the story . So , as I finished Cross Stitch ( my working title for what later became Outlander ) , 13 I could see that there was more to the story . With a three-book contract in hand , I started in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over halfway through , though , I began to get this uneasy feeling that perhaps I would n't be able to cram the entire American Revolution into one more book , and there would have to be four volumes . I confided this fear to Perry , who said , " Do n't tell them that . Not until the first one is on the shelves , anyway . " Fortunately , by the time we decided to reveal the Awful Truth , the first books had come out and sold decency , and the publisher was happy to make us an offer for the fourth ( and presumably final ) book in the series . Feeling that this was perhaps the only chance I might get to induce someone to pay me to write a mystery , I got bold and said they could have the fourth book if they 'd also give me a contract to write a contemporary mystery . Rather to my surprise , they gave me acontract for two mysteries -- and the fourth of the Outlander books . So I set in to write . I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a year and a half of this , I said , I 've got a quarter-million words here ; why the heck am I not nearly done with this ? A little thought revealed the answer ; I had ( once again ) too much story to fit into one book . Attending a writers ' conference at which my editor was also present , I leaned over during the awards banquet and hissed in her ear , " Guess what ? There are five of them . " To which Jackie , a woman of great presence and equanimity , replied , " Why am I not surprised to hear this ? " Actually , it was worse than I thought . When I removed all the pieces that belonged in the fifth book , I finally realized that what I was looking at was a double trilogy -- six books in all . The first three books -- Outlander , Dragonfly in Amber , and Voyager -- are centered around the Jacobite Rising of 1745 . The second three books are centered in a similar way around the American Revolution , which was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier conflict that ended at Culloden . And that leads us in turn to a consideration of just what 's going on in these books . Once I realized that I really was a writer , and that I had not one , but a series of books , I had two main intentions . One was a desire to follow the great social changes of the eighteenth century . This was a time of huge political and social upheaval that saw the transition of the Western world from the last remnants of feudalism into the modern age , in terms of everything from politics and science to art and social custom . The tide of history was changing , flowing from the Old World to the New , borne on the waves of war , and what better way to look at this than through the eyes of a time-traveler ? Now , this is great stuff for the background of a novel , to be sure , but the fact is that good novels are about people . A book that does n't have an absorbing personal story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas -- but it wo n't be good fiction . So what about the personal angle of this story ? The first book was originally marketed as a historical romance because , although the book did n't fit neatly into any genre ( and at the same time was certainly not " literary fiction " ) , of all the markets that it might conceivably appeal to , romance was by far the biggest . However . . . Other considerations aside , romance novels are courtship stories . They deal with the forming of a bond between a couple , and once that bond is formed , by marriage and sexual congress ( in that order , we hope ) well , the story 's over . That was never what I had in mind . I did n't want to tell the story of what makes two people come together , although that 's a theme of great power and universality . I wanted to find out what it takes for two people to stay together for fifty years -- or more . I wanted to tell not the story of a courtship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle adequately themes like the Age of Enlightenment , the fall of monarchy , and the nature of love and marriage , one requires a certain amount of room . One also requires rather a complex story . People now and then say to me , " But are n't you getting tired of writing about the same old characters ? " I certainly would be , if these were the same old characters -- but they 're not . They grow , and they change . They get older , and their lives become more complex . They develop new depths and facets . While they do -- I hope -- remain true to their basic personalities , I have to rediscover them with each new book . And that leads to another question I 'm often asked : What is it that people find interesting about the books ? For a long time , I replied ( honestly ) , " Beats me , " but after years of getting letters and E-mail , I now have some idea of the things readers say they like . Many of them enjoy the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and time . Many like the historical aspects of the books ; they enjoy ( they say ) " learning something " while being entertained . Many like the sense of connection , of rediscovering their own heritage . A good many enjoy the curious details : the botanical medicine , the medical procedures , the how and why of daily life in another time . But by far the most common element that people enjoy in the books is simply the characters -- readers care for these people , are interested in them , and want to know more about them . So , this companion is intended for the readers : a quick reference for those who do n't necessarily want to reread a million and a half words in order to refresh their memories as to Who or What ; a source of information and ( maybe ) insight on the characters , a companion for those with an interest in backgrounds and trivia ; an auxiliary guide for those with an interest in the eighteenth century and Things Scottish , and finally -- a brief glimpse into the working methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the point made , though , that the novelist 's skill lies in the artful selection of detail . Do you not suppose that a volume of such length may indicate a lack of discipline in such selection , and hence a lack of skill ? " Fraser considered , sipping the ruby liquid slowly . " I have seen books where that is the case , to be sure , " he said . " An author seeks by sheer inundation of detail to overwhelm the reader into belief . In this case , however , I think it isna so . Each character is most carefully considered , and all the incidents chosen seem necessary to the story . No , I think it is true that some stories simply require a greater space in which to be told . "  - -  Voyager , chapter 11 : " The Torremolinos Gambit " 1 . The university and I later sold this pub1ication to John Wiley &; Sons , Inc. , though I continued to serve as editor . It eventually was sold again , to a small British pub1isher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microcomputer . Last time I looked , I was still listed as a contributing editor , but that was some time ago . 2 . Oh , the comic books . Well , my mother taught me to read at an early age , in part by reading me Walt Disney comics . What with one thing and another , I never stopped . At the age of twenty-eight or so , I was reading one of these , and said to myself , You know , this story is pretty bad . I bet I could do better myself . I found out the name and address of the editor in charge , and sent him a medium-rude letter , saying in essence , " I 've been reading your comic books for twenty-five years , and they 're getting worse and worse . I do n't know that I could do better myself , but I 'd like to try . " Fortunately the editor -- Del Connell -- was a gentleman with a sense of humor . He wrote back and said , " Okay . Try . " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuab1e ; he told me what was wrong with it . He bought my second story -- one of the Great Thrills of my life -- and I wrote for him and for another Disney editor , Tom Golberg , for some three years , until their backlog ob1iged them to stop purchasing freelance scripts . Between them , Del and Tom taught me most of what I know about story structure . I acknowledge the debt with great gratitude. 3 . This is a really sound technique , by the way . 4 . Doctor Who is unfortunately no longer on our local PBS channel , but luckily I can still do my nails on Saturday nights , while watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 -- which is , in fact , the only TV I do watch on a regular basis . No doubt this explains something , but I could n't tell you what . 5 . It was " War Games , " for those interested in trivia . 6 . See " Research " . 7 .

A slightly altered version of this synopsis appears in Part Two . 11 . Ignorant as I was at the time , I had n't realized that agent ( and editors ) normally want to see a complete manuscript before making a judgment on it -- just to be sure that the writer can actually finish the book . Perry , fortunately , was willing to gamb1e that I could . 12 . Who , interestingly enough , rejected the manuscript .
