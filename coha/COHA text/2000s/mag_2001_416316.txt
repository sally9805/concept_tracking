Europa 's lacework pattern of fractures and faults etched across its surface provides planetary scientists with many clues about this semifrozen world . NASA/JPL/USGS // Exploring Europa is a top priority for NASA planners because the ocean below its icy crust , or even pockets in the ice , may harbor life . DECEMBER 31 , 2010 : It has been a daunting voyage to the second of the four jovian moons Galileo discovered four centuries ago . Launched in 2007 , the Europa Orbiter spacecraft has traveled half a billion miles , chasing a dot of light whizzing around Jupiter at 30,000 miles per hour . Last week , it maneuvered out of Jupiter 's gigantic gravitational hug and sidled into Europa 's gentle embrace . The orbiter 's color-enhanced pictures of what looks like a scuffed-up orange billiard ball with white polar patches are the sharpest ever seen of the object , which is about the same size as Earth 's moon . The dark and salty waters of our solar system 's largest ocean may circulate under Europa 's cracked and wrinkled surface . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath , or whether the ocean contains life . As Europa Orbiter begins transmitting data this week , the final week of 2010 , it may mark our first exploration not merely of another planetary body , but another living biosphere . In 2001 , of course , the Europa Orbiter is still a dream - merely drawings on the whiteboards of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California , the main contractor for the mission . But the satellite of Jupiter is one of NASA 's highest priority targets in the outer solar system . Aquatic life thrives on the floors of Earth 's oceans , sustained by upwelling chemical nutrients from the planet 's interior . If an ocean exists on Europa , it would be reasonable to speculate that life could also exist , possibly near undersea volcanic vents . Originally expected to launch in 2003 , the Europa Orbiter is on track for launch in 2007 and arrival by 2010 , marking the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's discovery of Europa and its three neighboring moons - Io , Ganymede , and Callisto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarke 's 2010 , the sequel to 2001 : A Space Odyssey , in which Europa plays a key role . UNDER STRESS Before the Voyager missions gave us our first close-up view of Jupiter 's satellites in 1979 , Europa was just another icy moon , an asterisk in Galileo Galilei 's astronomical drawings . But Voyagers 1 and 2 revealed that Europa differed greatly from the other Galilean moons . Photograph Europa 's lacework pattern of fractures and faults etched across its surface provides planetary scientists with many clues about this semifrozen world . NASA/JPL/USGS // Ganymede and Callisto looked similar to our own moon , pockmarked with craters . Io turned out to be a sulfurous , volcanic cauldron . But Europa 's surface looked as if Zamboni machines were constantly resurfacing its icy crust ; it has very few craters . Instead , it is crisscrossed by thousands of reddish stretch marks . These marks suggest that tidal stresses are melting Europa 's ice from within . Both Europa and Io stretch and relax like rubber balls each time they move toward Jupiter and away ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and gives rise to constant volcanic eruptions . On Europa , which is farther away from Jupiter , the stretch-induced heating is gentle enough to permit liquid water covered by ice to exist . The Galileo spacecraft gathered evidence for an underground ocean on Europa after it began orbiting Jupiter in 1995 and photographing its moons . The images showed " chaos regions , " where jumbles of large ice rafts resemble Antarctic floes that have broken up and refrozen . Galileo delivered an unexpected finding last year : An instrument aboard the spacecraft detected variations in the moon 's magnetic field that show that Europa is a SeaWorld beyond our world . ( Ganymede and Callisto are also believed to contain oceans , under a much deeper layer of ice than that covering Europa . ) Could Europa 's SeaWorld harbor life ? At first , scientists believed the ice was up to 100 miles thick . But some planetary scientists argue that the chaos regions on Europa suggest that the ice may be as thin as one mile , and it may have been breached with slushy geysers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This 3-D perspective of a europan double ridge shows water ice on ridge crests and silicates or salts on the valley floor .

NASA/JPL/DLR // Once thought to be devoid of sunlight or other sources of energy , Europa may have warm spots under its ice that support periodic " blooms " of microscopic life . Depending on whom you talk to , Europa has become our best or second-best hope for finding extraterrestrial life in our solar system . The Galileo spacecraft has given us a much better understanding of Europa 's environment - but astrobiologists wonder if the place is too inhospitable for life of any form . EXTREME EXPLORING For example , the surface of Europa is the ultimate extreme environment . Its surface temperature is a chilly - 240deg F ( - 151deg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as electrons , protons , and sulfur ions , constantly bombard the satellite . Io produces the chemically reactive particles , which become trapped in Jupiter 's magnetic field and create aurorae in the jovian atmosphere . Because Europa has only a very thin atmosphere , the particles zip nearly unimpeded into its surface at 40 miles per second . Particles traveling at that speed would cause serious damage to any life-form . " It 's like being 30 feet from the core of a 100-megawatt nuclear reactor , " says JPL 's Richard Terrile , chief scientist for NASA missions to the outer planets . The radiation would fry unshielded electronics . " It would kill an astronaut in an EVA suit in 12 minutes , " he says . " The Europa Orbiter arguably is the most difficult mission NASA has ever attempted . " Anything that lands on Europa will be able to appreciate the icy view only briefly . Robotic landers or astronauts would have to burrow into the ice like moles for protection . Surprisingly , even three feet of ice would provide an excellent shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this safe depth , human or robotic explorers could sample Europa 's chemistry and look for freeze-dried microbes . Europa is a candy store for chemists : To sample what 's there , they would simply scoop up ice and melt it . They could concentrate samples , purify them , and even examine them under a microscope - a first for a deep-space mission . Any explorer would find the satellite 's brightly lit surface a snowmobiler 's paradise . With a tenuous atmosphere , it never snows on Europa ; however , meteorites have likely struck the surface often enough to create a 2-foot-thick layer of debris . " We may find ourselves up to our chins in very fluffy ice , " says Eric Gaidos , a JPL geobiologist . The explorers may also encounter the mysterious substance that gives Europa its lemony hue . Spacecraft  --  instrument readings suggest that the colored material could be magnesium sulfate , Epsom salt that yellowed in the intense radiation , sulfur , or sulfuricacid ice . Whatever it is , it may have welled up from Europa 's ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph Top : This 86-mile ( 140-km ) impact scar was caused by a mountain-sized asteroid or comet .

Bottom right : This photo shows thin , disrupted ice crust in Europa 's Conamara region . // Overhead , Jupiter will loom over the explorers like a brightly striped beach ball - unless they land on the farside of Europa , in which case they will never see the giant planet . Just as only one side of our moon faces Earth , Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter . If we were extremely lucky , our lander might witness a " cryovolcanic " eruption . Planetary scientists think liquid carbon dioxide squeezed under high pressure through cracks in the ice power these dramatic events . Like opening a well-shaken can of soda , the liquid carbon dioxide would bubble explosively upon reaching the surface . " You 'd get a spectacular geyser : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The exhaust velocity of an eruption like that would fire material about 60 miles up , because of Europa 's weak gravity . " The geyser would be a temporary , though spectacular , snow-maker - water in the spray would freeze on the way up , and fall as snowflakes or hailstones . It would be a gorgeous sight , but also dangerous since there is no atmosphere to slow the hail down . No one knows how often - or if  --  such eruptions occur . CREEPING CRACKS A lander would more likely witness the formation of new cracks . According to Gregory Hoppa , a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona , these cracks result from the tides in Europa 's ocean . These tides would make those of Miami or Tokyo seem piddly . Tides on Europa would make the crust rise and fall 100 feet during one of its 85-hour days . Though the motion would be too gradual for astronauts to feel , it would crack the brittle ice . On Earth , a spreading crack on a frozen lake moves fast enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks would creep so slowly through the thick ice that an astronaut on foot would be able to keep up with them , The crack would change directions as the day proceeds . Responding to the changing direction of the tidal stress , the cracks would trace scalloped ruffles across the jovian satellite . With no atmosphere to carry sound , cracks would open and close in silence , but an astronaut would feel them  --  especially those due to Europaquakes created when blocks of ice suddenly shift . In the past year , researchers have found that some of Europa 's cracks are fault lines , some as long as the San Andreas Fault in California . " Over the course of a day , the crack opens , then it shears , then it closes again , then it tries to shear back , " says Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona and the Galileo imaging team . " But it does n't go anywhere , because that second shear comes as it is closed . We call this process walking , because it 's exactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the layer of ice is thin enough - perhaps less than one mile - to crack all the way through . Their thin-ice hypothesis is based on observations that show roughly 18 percent of Europa has large chunks of frozen crust that have been disrupted , tilted , and rotated . Many scientists think these chaos regions are the result of a thin crust of ice floating on a layer of moving water or slush . In this case , Greenberg says , " The biosphere extends right up to the surface ! Other experts think Greenberg is on scientific " thin ice " for various reasons . For example , the 16-mile-wide crater Pwyll , one of Europa 's few conventional moonlike features , apparently did not break through the surface . To take such a hit and not break through to the fluid below indicates to planetary scientists that the ice must be 6 to 12 miles thick . In this view , the Europaquakes occur only in an upper brittle layer of extremely cold ice , which rests on a thicker layer of warmer , more-flexible ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things are not easy to predict . It 's healthy to have a diversity of opinions , because it means that probably somebody will be right . " The thickness of ice matters a great deal for the likelihood of life on Europa and how we would go about looking for it . Thick ice would n't rule out the possibility of life , but it would make life there more difficult to sustain because life requires energy as well as water . " Replication and repairing oneself , all these functions of life are energy-consuming , " Gaidos says . " When we talk about Europa we also have to think about what the energy sources are going to be ! Photograph 1 . When the sun is high in Europa 's sky , its ridges appear more frost-covered. 2 . Europan ice cliffs are comparable in size to those at mount Rushmore , South Dakota . 3 . Younger fractures cut older ones and horizontal movement indicates fault lines . 4 . The broken ice in this chaos region has moved around and rotated . 5 . Ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // A thick layer of ice would isolate europan life from its two biggest energy sources : sunlight and radiation from Jupiter . Photosynthesizing microbes near the surface could use sunlight . Radiation could produce reactive chemicals like hydrogen peroxide , a potential energy source for organisms . In the thin-ice model , these energy sources would be available . LIFE IN NICHES In the thick-ice model , europan organisms could use geothermal energy - the type of energy that powers deep-sea-vent communities on Earth . However , in a pessimistic assessment published in 1999 , Gaidos argued that geothermal energy alone can not fuel a biosphere on Europa . And even on Earth , deep-sea organisms depend on chemicals produced by photosynthetic organisms at the surface of the ocean , says Gaidos . However , he has changed his mind in the past year , because of a newly discovered fourth energy source - fault lines . Using the thick-ice model , Gaidos has calculated that friction between ice plates could lead to a " thermal runaway " in the fracture zone . The heating would be sufficient to melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . These hypothetical structures are similar to brine pockets in Arctic Sea ice inhabited by algae . Organisms on Europa could , in theory , " bloom " in these pockets while the fault was active , then become dormant for millennia until the next fault formed . If so , life on Europa suddenly seems easier to find . For several years , scientists have thought a planetary probe would have to melt or drill through miles of ice , a huge project that would probably have to wait until the next generation of scientists . But if Gaidos is right , the probes may only need to drill down a few hundred feet . Prior reconnaissance and the ability of a burrowing probe to find and maneuver toward active fault zones would be needed to reach brine pockets . The new proximity of niches for life also argues for greater caution . Nobody knows whether life has evolved on Europa , but microbes carried from Earth by a spacecraft could conceivably contaminate Europa . Greenberg imagines the jovian satellite as pristine - an " open sore " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur C. Clarke 's 2010 , a mysterious alien race forbids us from landing on Europa , presumably because a different form of life is brewing there . Few , if any , scientists want Europa to be declared off-limits , but they are taking the concerns of people such as Clarke seriously . Greenberg contends that NASA does not yet have a non-contamination policy appropriate for such a vulnerable ecosystem . There may or may not be life on Europa , but no planetary scientist can rule it out . " In my opinion , it 's considerably less likely than life on Mars , " says Stevenson . " But even though life on Europa may be less likely , it is potentially more interesting , because it 's so different : ' Evidence of water in Mars 's past has , in Stevenson 's opinion , made the existence of life on that planet more probable . But if so , it may consist of microbes that hitched a ride from one planet to the other eons ago on a meteorite . In Terrile 's words , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks to fill an Egyptian pyramid have reached Earth as meteorites since the beginning of the solar system , and some rocks from Earth that were ejected during impacts may have reached Mars . On the other hand , Europa almost certainly has been isolated from both Earth and Mars since all of them formed . Says Terrile , " That makes it an incredibly important laboratory for understanding whether life arose independently of life on Earth . " Photograph JPL has proposed the Europa Ocean Explorer ( top ) to search under the ice , where black smokers similar to those on Earth ( left ) may be found .
