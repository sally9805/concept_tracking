In a playful moment at the Ms. photo shot Margaret Cho and Camryn Manheim act out for the camera the power women working together . // From the rewood forests of California to the New York island to the Gulf Stream waters , a feminist tide is sweeping over America . The spread of its gains and the flow of the current of opinion are steady , slow , sure , unmistakable . And because support reaches its crest among younger women , we believe the future course is also clear . Today , in a country so narrowly divided in its politics that the loss of one seat shifts party control of the Senate and the last presidential election had to be decided in federal courts , an unshakably solid majority of more than eight out of every ten women say they feel favorable toward the women 's movement , its accomplishments , and its goals . And the numbers of men who agree are not far behind . These findings are from a nationwide survey of more than a thousand women and men conducted in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are nationally representative within a three-point margin . Many parts of the current Ms. Poll : The 2003 Ms. Magazine Survey on Women , Men , and Feminism are comparable to earlier Harris poll data. * Overall , as noted , a very strong 83 percent of the women queried said they approved of the movement to strengthen women 's rights . Looking closer by age , the survey found that 76 percent of the women who are in their fifties and sixties in 2003-the generation who were at the forefront of the emerging women 's liberation movement in the 1960s-have favorable feelings toward it today . But it is their daughters and granddaughters who are most likely to express positive views . Among women in the 18 to 24 age group , a sky-high 92 percent rate the women 's movement favorably . In other words , those who are the main beneficiaries of the women 's movement know who 's responsible for the doors they find open . When asked if they felt that feminists and the women 's movement have been helpful to them , 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent-said yes . What do they credit the women 's movement for ? Women 's greater job opportunities , higher education levels , changes in the workplace that allow combining jobs with families , and better pay . More than 80 percent of all respondents cited the women 's movement as the moving force behind these positive changes in society . Contradicting once again the often-heard comment from critics that the movement is largely of , by , and for middle-class white women , our poll-like earlier polls  --  confirms that women of color are staunch backers of the women 's movement : 95 percent of the Latina women , and 93 percent of the African American women in the current survey said they felt favorable toward the movement to strengthen women 's rights . Although the sub-samples of these two groups were small , their high positive numbers indicate overwhelming support for the women 's movement among women of color . Furthermore , although conservatives in talk media have tarred the word feminism in an attempt to attach it to the caricature of a strident ball-buster or man-hating bra-burner-think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , and today more women identify themselves as " feminists " ( 56 percent ) than they did in 1995 ( 51 percent ) in a similar poll , also conducted by Harris . This significant increase of five points indicates at least partial recovery from what some feminists have identified as " the battered-word syndrome . " When given the dictionary definition of the word as " someone who supports political , economic , and social equality for women , " the number of women who call themselves " feminists " shot up to 77 percent . Only 19 percent still disavowed the dictionary feminist label after hearing what it really meant . Favorable responses to all questions gauging the public 's perception of the women 's movement gained several percentage points when compared to the earlier poll . When women were asked in 2003 if they felt favorable toward the women 's movement , the survey found a gain of seven points over 1995 ; when asked if they considered themselves feminists , a gain of five points ; after hearing the definition of a feminist , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions asking the public 's perception of the movement to strengthen women 's rights represented a solid , certain , slow-but-sure gain in the popularity of feminism as we move into the 21st century . Men were less likely to call themselves " feminist " than women . Many men may consider the term to apply only to women-how can a guy be a feminist ? , they may be wondering . And " feminist " and " effeminate " do sound a bit alike ; men who might be perfectly comfortable with the first might feel quite uneasy about the second label . Whatever form it takes , some confusion over the word-in fact , the term is gender-neutral-could be why a majority of men either said they were not feminists or were " not sure " when first asked in the current poll . Only slightly more than a third , or 34 percent , of the men initially identified themselves as feminists ; yet when the men heard the dictionary definition of feminism , that number rose to 70 percent . Says Harris : " Once they hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidly support political , economic , and social equality for women . " Perhaps they were thinking of the need for equal pay for equal work for their mothers , wives , and girlfriends . Overall , when those who identified themselves as feminists explained why they did , several reasons were given . Most frequently cited ( 68 percent ) was belief in equal rights for women . Other reasons were that women deserve respect ; they are independent and self  --  sufficient ; women should be able to do what they want . That women are n't treated equally was also a factor . Harris notes that women over 30 were more likely than younger women to mention multiple reasons for being a feminist . Strong Support for Abortion Rights Photograph IT 'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT 'S USUALLY MEANT BY A FASHION STATEMENT . Even so , It Is what she wore for a photograph in Glamour magazine , and she 's been known to make it part of her celebrity persona , too . AS one entertainment writer reported : " Although she is a huge movie star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too big to great an interviewer outside her hotel bungalow wearing a floppy orange hat baggy sweat pants and a T-shirt with the message : This Is what a feminist looks like . " In the fashion magazine story , Judd credited the Feminist Majority as the source of her T-shirt , which provoked a real run on them . When Eleanor Smeal , head of the Feminist Majority Foundation that now publishes Ms. , heard about this , " we asked Ashley If she would wear one In a photograph for our cover . " Judd agreed , but she was traveling and did n't have the right T-shirt with her , so she had one specially made in the nick of time . Ashley Judd 's relationship with the Feminist Majority Is not a new one . when she and her mother , country singer Naomi Judd , joined other notables at a Feminist Majority event In 1999 to publicize the plight of Afghan women , Ashley explained her feminist roots : " My mother robed my sister Wynonna and me in the magnificent gifts of the **25;2516;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed us with a sense of self-worth. " in spite of her movie success in films like High Crimes with Morgan Freeman and Frida with Saima Hayek , Judd has avoided obsessing over Hollywood business " That can turn into a whole life for some people ... but I have a real life to lead . " Late last year , her real life included touring cities in seven states with U2 lead singer Bono to educate Americans about HIV and the AIDS crisis In Africa . As Judd explained to the Today Show 's Katie Couric , AIDS Is a feminist Issue : " We have to educate our women . Girls in Africa are being infected at many times the rate of men . They 're not economically and socially and culturally independent of men .... They 're having unprotected sex because that 's how they get their food . " Sex , AIDS , HIV have to be talked about honestly abroad and at home , Judd said , recalling " the President Truman quote-if you give Americans the facts , they 'll do the right things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU SAY YOU 'RE NOT A FEMINIST YOU 'RE ALMOST DENYING YOUR OWN EXISTENCE .

" CAROL WHEELER // By a three-to-one margin ( 73 percent to 24 percent ) , both women and men strongly favored a woman 's right to an abortion with the advice of her doctor . This is almost exactly the same level recorded in 1995 ( 74 percent ) . The greatest support for abortion rights came from women aged 18 to 29 ( 76 percent ) , who would have no first  --  hand knowledge of a time when abortion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent ) ; and from those living in western states ( 83 percent ) . The survey did record a statistical increase in the minority of Americans opposed to abortion-up from 18 percent in 1995 to 24 percent in 2003 . " This gain should be considered in light of the 49-point gap between those in favor of abortion and those opposed , and the significant media campaign of right-to-life advocates during the past several years , " says Harris . He also points out that the six-point gain in opposition to abortion was spread among all age groups and came primarily from those who were undecided about this issue eight years ago . Regardless of how abortion was viewed , the survey found that abortion touches many households . Four in ten Americans ( 40 percent ) said they were close to someone who has had an abortion . For women 18 to 29 , the number rose to 63 percent . When broken down along gender lines , nearly half of all women polled said they were close to someone who has had an abortion ( 49 percent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 percent ) do . Even among women and men who were opposed to abortion , 29 percent said they were on intimate terms with someone who has had one . When asked about advocacy organizations that deal with the issue of abortion , both women and men expressed highly favorable attitudes toward Planned Parenthood ( 79 percent ) , with the number going as high as 93 percent among men 18 to 29 , and only slightly less for women in the same age group ( 90 percent ) . The percentage of favorable ratings dips as the age of the respondent increases , but even among women 65 and older , 68 percent ranked Planned Parenthood positively . Yet despite the solid support for abortion rights and organizations that support them , people were sympathetic to the right-to-life message , according to Harris . The survey found that a 59 percent majority of women and men felt favorable about the National Right to Life Committee , including 58 percent of the people who called themselves feminists . " While this does not translate into a change in bottom-line support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does suggest that many people do not see this issue as quite so black and white as some activists do . " Lack of Confidence In Male  --  Dominated Organizations A significant proportion of people expressed distrust of organizations run largely by men . Forty-seven percent of both women and men said they felt " unfavorable " toward those individuals running major corporations , while another 17 percent said they were unsure of their feelings toward those at the top of the corporate hierarchy . The numbers represent a significant change from 1995 , when only 32 percent of the people polled ( women , 29 percent ; men , 35 percent ) held unfavorable opinions of industry leaders , and when headlines were not filled day after day with new reports of wrongdoings and greed . The contrast is sharp and supports what feminists have long said about the importance of opening up organizations traditionally run by men to include ( and benefit from ) talented women .

In a similar vein , neither women or Photograph WHOOPI GOLDBERG IS A GOOD PERSON TO HAVE ON YOUR SIDE . She has won an Oscar , two Golden Globes , a British Academy Award , an Emmy , a Grammy , a Tony , and the prestigious Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor . She 's capable of emotionally searing performances ( The Color Purple ) , hilarious star turns ( Academy Awards host ) and major success at just about any kind of show biz extravaganza , from TV to movies to Broadway stage , where she was one of the guest stars doing The vagina Monologues and where she has been playing In the revival of Ma Rainey 's Black Bottom . Whoopi Goldberg has never minced words . one of the most outspoken stars In today 's Hollywood , Whoopi is also a woman who puts her money and her name where her mouth Is . And It 's not just talk  --  Goldberg has raised money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched for choice and equal rights . She 's always been a committed feminist . AS far back as 1986 , she was telling audiences of the Today Show : " An actress can only play a woman . I 'm an actor , I can play anything . " One of the many pro-active things she 's done is to tell the story of her own abortion ( in the bad old coat-hanger days ) , in a book called The Choices We Made : 25 Women and Men Speak Out About Abortion . Whoopi is famous for standing up for her beliefs , but these days even she is stunned by the political scene . At the photo shoot for the Ms. cover , she was heard to say , wonderingly , " What are they doing to Roe v. Wade ? " On one fan 's Web site , she is described as " a champion for the homeless , children , human rights , substance abuse , the battle against AIDS , and other worthwhile causes .... " Clearly ( hence the T-shirt ) Whoopi has decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least on very prominent display . On other Web sites-URLS like childrenoftherosary.org for instance-Whoopi Goldberg is a named villain . When she 's lucky , all these groups do is suggest their readers pray for her . Her views on abortion are simple , she told McCall 's several years ago : " I believe that choice is what it 's about . If you choose to have the child , hopefully you 'll have people around you who will be supportive . If you choose not to , hopefully you 'll have people around you who will be supportive . I only mind people trying to force their beliefs on someone else . " - c.w. // men gave high marks to the National Council of Catholic Bishops . The organization received a favorable rating from only 30 percent of the respondents , possibly because it has been in the forefront of opposing abortion rights , and has been laggard in its response to charges of sexual abuse of parishioners by priests .

Nearly two-thirds of those polled , or 65 percent , said they felt favorable toward NOW . The agreement between the sexes here is high : 67 percent ( women ) and 63 percent ( men ) . Surprisingly , even 56 percent of those opposed to abortion rights and 48 percent of Republicans polled felt favorable to NOW . " This finding , as well as others in the survey , signals that the women 's movement is about much more than abortion rights , " says Harris . " People can agree on supporting the women 's movement , even if they disagree on abortion rights . " Turning to politics , the party with more women among its leadership ( Democratic ) was seen more favorably than the other ( Republican ) . Two issues recently in the news may also have come into play : Republican Senator Trent Lott 's race-laced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job as Majority Leader of the Senate , and the selection of Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi as Minority Leader in the House . Overall , Democratic Congressional leaders were rated more favorably than Republicans by a 57 to 30 percent margin . Harris attributes this affirmation of Democratic leaders to their " challenging the Bush administration on the economy , tax policy , federal deficits , and social policies . " Outside of those who affiliate themselves with the party , the highest ratings for Democratic leaders came from African Americans ( 79 percent ) , Latinos ( 74 percent ) , 18-to-29-year  --  olds ( 66 percent ) , and feminists ( 64 percent ) .

" Pause . " Unless we do n't let them . " Her rallying cry ? " Put the uteruses in a lockbox and keep the government 's hands off them . " Choice , however , is not the only issue that gets Manheim 's attention . She and Whoopi Goldberg took over a whole week of Hollywood Squares last year for the benefit of the Feminist Majority Foundation 's Campaign to Help Afghan Women and Girls and ended up presenting a check for $250,000 to that organization . " People asked us , Why are you spending so much time on Afghan women when there are so many domestic problems ? My answer , " Manheim says , " is that if women there had a voice on things like civil liberties and choice , September 11 might not have happened . " She adds , " I do n't consider myself a citizen of the tl.S . I consider myself a citizen of the world . It matters to me what happens to women all over the world .

" Although she herself has strong views of a very liberal political bent , Manheim Insists , " You do n't have to be a liberal to believe in equal rights for women . " She believes that " we need to make a huge appeal to young people . Do n't we have any young leaders anymore ? Look who you 're putting on the cover of your magazine . " With an Emmy , a Golden Globe , a hit one-woman show , a bestselling book , and the feature film she Is about to produce , Manheim knows her own mind . She does n't sit on the sidelines . And following her bottom-line advice , neither should anyone else : " Get your ass out there and vote for people who will support your needs , " Manheim says .
