Chapter One I stood on the sidewalk in front of City Hall in downtown Los Angeles on a warm April morning thinking of my father , who had been dead for a long time , and " Dragnet , " his favorite TV series . City Hall was engraved on the badge that Sergeant Friday flashed weekly in his dour pursuit of law and order , and my father never missed a single episode . He was a big believer in law and order . " Dragnet " fueled his black-and-white vision of the world as consisting of humorless machos like Sergeant Friday and himself battling the forces of evil . In my father 's expansive view this included most Anglos , all blacks , many Mexicans , priests , Jews , lawyers , doctors , people on welfare , the rich , and everyone under forty . He was a great and impartial hater ; anyone different from him became an object of his contempt . Homosexuals , had he allowed that such creatures existed , would certainly have qualified . As I started up the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated me more because I was homosexual or a lawyer . Then I reminded myself that he had never needed a reason to hate me . It was enough that I was not him . For my own part , I no longer hated my father , though , admittedly , this had become easier after his death . Forgiveness was still a problem . I took the steps too fast and stopped to catch my breath when I reached the top . I was forty , and I found myself thinking of my father more often now than in all the years since his death . He was ferociously alive in my memory where all the old battles still raged on . Sometimes I had to remind myself not only that he was dead , but that I had been there . He had died in a brightly lit hospital room , slapping away my consoling hand and screaming at my mother , " Mas luz , mas luz . " It had never been clear to me whether he was asking for more light , or crying out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us could not see . He had died with that mystery , as with so many others . I entered the rotunda of City Hall , a grave , shadowy place , its walls made of great blocks of limestone . Three limp flags hung high above a circular floor of inlaid marble that depicted a Spanish galleon . Around the domed ceiling were eight figures in tile representing the attributes of municipal government : Public Service , Health , Trust , Art , Protection , Education , Law , and Government . I searched in vain for the other four : Expedience , Incompetence , Corruption , and Avarice . Undoubtedly I would encounter them in the hearing I was there to attend . Six weeks earlier a bill had been introduced in the state senate by Senator Agustin Pea who represented East Los Angeles . Pea 's bill made it a crime to " actively participate in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity . " Despite its abridgment of the First Amendment right to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature easily . Even though passage was a foregone conclusion , the senate committee before whom the bill was pending had scheduled a public hearing in Los Angeles . The committee 's motives became clear when a Los Angeles Times columnist pointed out that the date of the hearing was also the last day for mayoral candidates to file for the upcoming June primary . The columnist cynically concluded that Senator Pea planned to use the occasion to announce his entry into the race , positioning himself as the law-and-order candidate . When asked about it , Pea , who had been preparing for months to run , coyly declined comment . A few days later , in mid-March , Pea ran over an old man in Sacramento , killing him . At the time , the Senator 's blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit for drunk driving . He was charged with gross vehicular manslaughter . Immediately thereafter , he had entered a drug-and-alcohol rehab called SafeHouse , and had not been heard from since . Two days ago , his office had announced that Pea would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing had become the hottest ticket in town . I entered the city council chamber , where the hearing was being held to a packed house . The Minicams were out in force representing TV stations as far north as San Francisco . Their presence reminded me that Pea was more than simply a local politician . He was perhaps the ranking Latino officeholder in the state , a symbol of the political aspirations of millions and , until his accident , the person most likely to become the first mayor of Los Angeles of Mexican descent in a hundred and fifty years . Although I had met Pea occasionally over the years , most of what I knew about him came from his campaign brochures and the newspapers . The former still portrayed him as the lean idealist who had marched in the dust of Delano with Cesar Chavez a quarter-century earlier . In the latter , he was depicted as a powerful patronage politician . Both accounts agreed that he was effective at his job . Over the years , however , he had become in a vague but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrogant in the pursuit of his objectives . The work shirts and jeans had given way to expensive suits tailored to conceal the growing thickness of his body . From my perspective he was no worse than most politicians , but certainly no better and I might even have voted for him . Whether I would 've voted for him or hot , I thought his bill was a disaster and I had come to testify against it . As far as I was concerned , it was a mandate for police harassment in Latino and black communities , not that the cops needed much encouragement on that front . Only last year , members of the LAPD had been inadvertently videotaped as they pulled a black man out of his car and beat him senseless . His crime was failing to pull over with sufficient dispatch to receive a speeding ticket . The spin doctors in the department asserted " isolated incident , " but my clients had been telling me for years about being beaten for what defense lawyers called contempt of cop . I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every poor black or Latino kid who gave them attitude . I had written a piece for the Times to that effect , and I was still getting hate calls three weeks later . " Rios . " I glanced over my shoulder . Tomas Ochoa lumbered toward me . He was tall , big-gutted and deliberately graceless as he clomped across the floor , forcing people out of his way . He came up to me like an old friend , crowding the space between us . It was a trick he used on people shorter than himself to force them to look up when they spoke to him . I moved back a step . Salt-and-pepper hair framed his dark moustached face . His eyes were hidden behind tinted aviator glasses . Ochoa preached the revolution from a classroom podium at the local state college where he taught in the Chicano Studies Department . On the wall of his office was a yellowing poster that demanded the end to the Anglo occupation of California . The last time I had seen him was at his school where we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's minorities . While the rest of us deplored the indifference with which minority political leaders had responded to the presence of AIDS among their constituents , Ochoa took the position that it only affected elements of the minority communities which they were better off without , homosexuals and drug users . We had not parted on friendly terms . I was surprised that he had sought me out today . I said , " Hello , Tomas . " " I read your article in the Times , " he said . " Where you defended the gangs . " " I did n't defend the gangs , " I replied . " All I said was that there are better ways of dealing with them than turning the police loose . " " Listen , Rios , the gangs are the best thing that ever came out of the barrio . With a little political education , they could be urban guerrillas . " " I deal with gang members all the time , " I told him . " They 're not revolutionaries . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " He frowned at me . " So your solution is to plea-bargain them into prison . " " The solution has to start long before they reach me . " " The solution , " he said , raising his voice , " is outside the system that you represent . " A few people had stopped to stare . I answered quietly , " The only thing I represent is my clients , Tomas , and I do it well . " " You represent something a lot worse than that , " he said , jabbing a finger at me . " Well , according to you , AIDS will take care of that , " I replied . " Or would you prefer concentration camps like Castro ? Or Hitler ? " " Take your choice , " he said , moving away . I watched him disappear into the sea of brown and black faces in the room , with the depressing certainty that he spoke for most of them . Whatever their other disagreements , the races all united in their contempt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of personal morality . At the front of the room , the senators had begun to assemble . I found a seat just as the chairwoman of the committee called the hearing to order . Spruce and intricately-coiffed , she announced , " These hearings have been called for the purpose of encouraging public debate on SB 22 , introduced by Senator Pea of East Los Angeles . " She was interrupted by a rising commotion from the audience as a door opened behind her and Agustin Pea walked briskly forward , the Minicams sweeping toward him . An aide pulled out his chair and he sat down , saying , " I apologize to the committee for my tardiness . I 'd like to make a statement . " The presiding senator replied , " Certainly , Senator Pea . Welcome back . " " Thank you , " he said . He raised his hand back over his shoulder . His aide handed him a sheaf of papers . Pea laid them on the desk before him and , for a moment , simply looked out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from a long , narrow face that El Greco might have painted , strong and melancholy ; it was the face of a man who had passed through something difficult and was not yet certain of his ground . He cleared his voice , and began to read from his papers . " The streets of our poorest communities have become battlefields . " Nearby , someone whispered , audibly , " Yeah , they 're full of drunk drivers . " " It 's time for action , " Pea continued . " It 's time to send a message to the gangsters that the decent people of our cities will not tolerate- " The same wag quipped , " Intoxicated politicians . " But this time , someone shushed him . " Their guns and their drugs , " Pea concluded . The crowd shifted restlessly waiting for him to address the topic of his political future . At length , he finished with his prepared statement and said , " Now , with the committee 's indulgence I would like to address my constituents in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was gaveled to order , the presiding senator saying , " You have the floor , Gus . " " Thank you , Charlene , " he said . " You 've been a good friend to me . In the past two months I 've had a chance to see , truly , who my real friends are . I 'm gon na ask some people to come up here and join me : my wife , Graciela , and my children ; my son , Tino , and my beautiful daughter , Angela . " The three got up from the front row and walked awkwardly to the dais where the senators were seated . His wife was a plump , pretty woman , who wore a photogenic dress of red and blue silk . She had mastered that vaguely beatific expression that Nancy Reagan had popularized among the wives of public figures . His teenage daughter kissed her father quickly and retreated to the background . His handsome son also kissed his father but remained at his side . Pea , reaching for his wife 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what life is really about , a loving family , people who stand by you no matter what , and these are the people I know I hurt the most with my alcoholism . " He paused for effect , and got it , the cameras clicking , the crowd whispering . I watched his family . His wife 's mouth twitched but her expression did not change . The girl retreated farther back . The boy looked straight ahead . Now that he was on his feet , Pea was as relaxed as a talk show host working the crowd . " I know that some of you in the press expected me to be making a different kind of announcement today , and I would be lying if I did n't tell you I would rather be standing here announcing my candidacy for mayor than admitting that I 'm an alcoholic . Still , " he smiled , " you roll with the punches . " The back room echoes of that remark were more authentic than what came next . " But maybe by doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is that I have had to look at my human weakness right in the eye and realize that I have spent so much time caring about and worrying about others , that I have not worried or cared enough about myself . I now know that it 's time for me to take care of me , to accept my responsibilities and my weaknesses . But I say to others who are as pained and hurt as myself , " and here he draped an arm over his son 's shoulders while gripping his wife 's hand , " I say to you , Join me brothers and sisters . We can make it . We will make it . It 's going to be a lonely journey , but I stand and God stands with me . ' " He released his children and his wife . " As you know , I have been at an alcohol rehabilitation center , and I believe that I have been cured of this disease of alcoholism . I have begun to heal my body and my soul . " Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gus , for you to admit you have this problem and to deal with it has truly lifted a burden from our souls . " She gestured vaguely toward the children . " I thank God you have had the strength to realize that you are truly in God 's hands . I know for our family this is just a beginning and we , Tino , Angela , and me , we will be with you every step of the way . " " God bless you , Graciela , " he said , choking back tears . To my astonishment , people around me were also crying . The presiding senator hammered the table with her gavel and said , " The committee stands in recess for fifteen minutes . " The media descended on the Peas , who were soon obscured by flashing cameras and shouted questions . An old gray-haired woman sitting near me cast a skeptical eye on the scene and muttered to no one in particular , in Spanish , " The man has no shame . " The cameras were gone when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pea 's family , and the proceeding reverted to its original purpose . Pea had resumed his seat and watched a parade of witnesses through half-glasses , showing increasingly less interest as the morning wore on . He passed a note to his neighbor , smiling like a schoolboy , and lit a cigarette , oblivious of the no-smoking sign posted on the wall just a few feet behind him . Continues ...
