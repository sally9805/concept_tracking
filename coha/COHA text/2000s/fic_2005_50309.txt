Prolific Paul Di Filippo has published several books recently , with more due out soon , including : a novel entitled Harp , Pipe , and Symphony ; a new story collection by the name of Emperor of Gondwanaland and Other Stories ; a comic book that picks up where Alan Moore left off , Top 10 : Beyond the Furthest Precinct ; and it 's rumored that his " Plumage from Pegasus " columns will soon be gathered into book form . So one might gather that Mr. Di Fi knows a thing or two about the book business . Perhaps that explains the origins of this tale of love and publishing . <p> RILEY SMALL 'S AGENT actually called Riley personally with the good tidings . Even gruff , self-important and generally uncommunicative agents tended to be more forthcoming and pleasant when an author stood to earn the agent hundreds of thousands of dollars above and beyond all the other bales of cash the client had already brought in . " Riley , good news , " said Harvard Morgaine , his speech partly occluded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of which Riley could vividly conjure up across the sixty Manhattan blocks separating them . " Miramax is nearly one hundred percent onboard . Weinstein is practically pissing his pants with sheer joy and greed . Know what he said to me ? " Strumpet 's going to be bigger than Bridget Jones 's ass . " How 's that make you feel ? " Riley winced . The comparison between his book and Zellweger 's method-acting butt was not one he would have chosen himself . " Uh , swell - Iguess . " " Super ! Okay now , there 's just one problem . We 've milked the mysterious author angle just about as long as we can . When Hollywood sticks its dick in the soup , there 's no escaping public appearances by the author . Entertainment Tonight , Leno , Letterman , the whole circuit . So Sally Strumpet is going to have to finally show her face . " A sick feeling instantly pervaded Riley 's gut . He 'd known this day was coming ever since he had inked the contract for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some two years ago . But the inevitability of the fateful moment had not lessened the dread associated with the exposure of his hoax . " Well , um , Harv , what do you suggest we do ? " " As I suss it , kid , there 're only two angles to this dilemma . Either we reveal Sally 's real identity - tell the world that their beloved nubile twenty-five-year-old sexual adventuress Sally Strumpet is really a deceitful thirty-five-year-old zhlub named Riley Small - or else we continue the charade by providing a living substitute for a vital person who inconveniently does n't exist . Now , each tactic has its pluses and minuses . The upside to coming clean about your authorship of the book is that it 's a simple , honest solution with no chance of blowing up in our faces , and you personally get to bask in the limelight . " " And the downside ? " " The downside is that you , me , your book , and any chance of signing the Miramax deal will go down the toilet faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like napalm from above . You remember that ruckus when the supposed Native American author of The Education of Little Tree was revealed to be a White Supremacist ? " " Uh-huh . " " Well , that little flap will look like a party at Elaine 's compared with the shitstorm that us admitting the truth will bring down on our heads . " " I see .... " Riley experienced a small hopeful memory of a similar literary scandal that had ended well . " Hey , what about that time in the science fiction world , when that writer everyone thought was a guy Tipitina ? - turned out to be a woman ? " " That Tiptree joker , you mean ? Does n't apply here . Women masquerading as men is cool . People cut them slack because they 're perceived as the underdogs trying to make it in a man 's world . But a guy shoehorning his way into a field reserved for women - You may as well put your balls into a noose . " Riley winced as Morgaine continued his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masquerade goes , we 're compounding your original sin by orders of magnitude , opening us up to even worse public ridicule and hatred if we 're ever exposed . Which of course , God willing , we wo n't be . But the commensurate upside is that we both get a shot to ride this baby all the way to a villa in Tuscany and a little grass shack in Maui for each of us . So , what 's it going to be ? " Riley could hear Morgaine ferociously chewing his cigar . The silence between author and agent seemed to stretch out forever . Riley considered his future under both scenarios . More importantly , he considered his past , the impulses and circumstances that had led him to write The secret Sutras of Sally Strumpet in the first place . The memories of those despairing days were ultimately what determined his answer . " Do I get to interview the women we 'll be considering to play Sally ? " " Kid , I got a deskful of headshots for you to start looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt crucified on the cross of his own ambitions . Since college , Riley had been convinced that he would some day be a famous writer . Some fairly significant talent on his part had been adduced by encouraging teachers and friends , convincing Riley that he had the chops to write a great book or three , thus gaining admission into the ranks of the masters he loved . But upon graduation , his dreams began to deflate faster than a parachute sucked into a jet engine . The manuscripts of his first two novels kept coming back from publishers with pleasant but firm brushoffs . The New Yorker and The Paris Review declined to add Riley 's name to their table-of-contents pages . Virtually every big-name and not-so-big-name agent listed in the Writer 's Digest guides had very politely failed to respond to his every solicitation for representation of his masterpieces-to-be . Despite setbacks that would have sent a lesser soul into a screaming retreat , Riley persisted with his dreams . To keep body firmly united with soul , Riley held a number of mediocre jobs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had ascended to the unremarkable position of assistant editor at a third-tier " lad " magazine , a publication titled Royale . ( " Hey - get Royale ! " was the magazine 's advertising tagline . The staffers , however , referred to their employer as " Roy 's Ale , " for the sixpack-mentality of its average subscriber . ) At the magazine , Riley proofed articles on South American aphrodisiacs and the sexual kinks of celebrities , all the while plotting his next assault on the Fortress of Literature . In parallel with his many defeats on the literary front , Riley had also sustained over the sad years more than his share of grievous damage on the romantic battlefield . His unswerving focus on making it as a writer tended to cause him to be less than attentive to such female-appreciated matters as compliments , punctuality , and the kind of social minutiae that insured that any book that utilized Jane Austen as a template would vault to the ranks of bestsellerdom . But in Riley 's partial defense , he felt , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere masculine inattention . Young single urban women today seemed incapable of sustaining any relationship that did not conform to an unreal mass-media template . Tutored by television , movies , and books to expect the perfect boyfriend to be rich , handsome , romantic , witty , faithful , and adoring , while at the same time encouraged to be demanding , capricious , over-sensitive , boisterous , and egocentric , the women Riley met and fell in love with invariably undermined any potentially long-term relationship . Not by being horrible bitches by any means . No , their hearts were generally good . But they were all just confused about how to reconcile their factitious needs with the realities of the male character . Raised on a diet of pink and aqua dreams of having perfectly glossy hair , perfectly rewarding careers , a perfect set of female friends and perfectly attentive lovers , the women Riley found himself dating were perfectly impossible . So a succession of live-in affairs had each eventually degenerated into a tense disentangling of formerly shared possessions and the curt exchange of forwarding addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least unshoutingly . It was at this downhearted juncture in his failed life that Riley was struck by his purest moment of literary inspiration . Browsing the fiction shelves at the Union Square branch of Barnes SL Noble one Saturday , Riley had been overwhelmed by the number of chicklit books , and the lofty positions they occupied on various bestseller lists . He had taken a stack of these novels to a chair and begun to read . At the end of four hours , he knew several things . 1 ) The psyches of these heroines matched those of Riley 's ex-girlfriends almost exactly . 2 ) At the core of each book was a desire to be accepted despite one 's imperfections. 3 ) On a practical level , nothing would screw up a working girl 's day worse than a laddering tear in her pantyhose . Unless it was a wild , cocaine-fueled orgy in the company 's co-ed John . And 4 ) , Riley fervently understood that he could write one of these books . It took Riley six white-hot months to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he poured the powerful twin streams of both his romantic and artistic frustrations . He found that by combining all the endearingly ditzy and annoyingly winsome qualities of his numerous past lovers into one figure , while minimizing their foibles ( all in the interests of readerly self-identification ) , he had distilled a kind of Ur-heroine who possessed enormous capabilities , charms , and appetites while remaining fascinatingly flawed . Sally Strumpet practically seemed to leap off the page , an adventurous Every woman evoking readerly empathy , summoned from deep within Riley 's anima . Strictly to formula , the book , despite various narrative detours , was a quest for love . Sally had to work her way through a series of losers before meeting Mr. Right . Sally 's stereotypically disappointing paramours all shared the various flaws of which Riley had heard himself accused . Riley constructed Sally 's ultimate dream beau - a supernaturally handsome Tierra del Fuegan sheepherder named Esteban Badura by blending elements of Enrique Iglesias , Antonio Banderas , and Dr. Phil . And by rigorously excluding everything he knew about great literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enticing prose style eminently suited to bestsellerdom - the literary equivalent of flypaper . Riley cast the book as a partially disguised fictionalization of the actual exploits of the pseudonym-concealed " Sally Strumpet . " A cleverly worded disclaimer up front insured that the reader could not think otherwise . Judiciously salted with references to barely veiled real persons , places , and events , the narrative slyly borrowed most of its plot from such classics as Tom Jones , Fanny Hill , Candy , and Fear of Flying . ( The latter novel being utilized despite Jong 's insistence that none of what she wrote qualified as chick-lit . ) Of course , plenty of modern touches - heartfelt cell phone and e-mail exchanges ; massive shopping expeditions ; numerous movie references - concealed these borrowings . Riley even managed to salve his literary credentials with his own soul by modeling the big climax on certain scenes from Ulysses . Just to ice the cake , Riley layered in some borrowed mysticism from a dozen New Age philosophies , thus justifying the whimsical title . Once the book was finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its type . He began marketing it with a dedication he had never expended before on his serious work . He concentrated solely on attracting an agent , since he wanted an intermediary between him and any publisher , to preserve the facade of female authorship . He met Harvard Morgaine at a party sponsored by Royale , and managed to convince the dapper , silver-haired agent to read the manuscript . Morgaine swiftly recognized the virtues of the book , and agreed to rep it . The contract Morgaine secured from Aleatory House was for a moderate **28;2620;TOOLONG advance . The first printing was set at fifty thousand copies . Those copies sold out in five weeks . Now , nearly a year after publication , Riley 's book remained in every top ten list , fluctuating in sales according to various bouts of publicity but never dropping below the number-ten spot on any national list . Once the announcement of an impending movie was made , sales would doubtlessly soar even higher . Riley now had more money than he had ever imagined having . But none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who had , despite her endearing ways , proved to be a treacherous bitch . " Okay , Riley , " said Morgaine , " I 've winnowed down our possibles to twenty candidates , based on their physical resemblance to Sally , the way she describes herself in the book . " " Harv , I wrote the book , remember ? Not Sally . Sally does n't exist . " Morgaine extracted his soggy cigar and waved it dismissively . " Of course , of course . Just a manner of speaking . You did such a convincing job bringing her to life , it 's only natural to talk about her like she really exists . Which she soon will . After a limited fashion . Anyhow , all I need you to do now is give me your opinion about which gal has that special Strumpet strut . We really need to pick someone who can convince the world that she wrote secret Sutras . " Riley leaned back wearily in one of the leather chairs in Morgaine 's office . The two men were alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books written by Morgaine 's clients . His eyes jerked away from the multiple copies of secret Sutras in their saccharine pastel covers . Next to those abominations stood last year 's winner of the National Book Award , contributed by another client of Morgaine 's . By all rights , a Riley Small novel should have rested there . But instead , Riley 's only legacy , totally anonymous , was a book that felt like it had been ghost-written for some selfish , larger-than-life celebrity . Knuckling his eyes , Riley said , " Okay , Harv , I 'll try . Let 's hope the perfect Sally Strumpet is waiting for us out there . " Morgaine resocketed his cigar and slapped Riley 's knee . " Excellent ! Let 's get the girls onto the catwalk . And remember - none of these babes know what we 're really interviewing them for . The last thing we need is for word to get out that we 're searching for a Strumpet lookalike . " Summoned by intercom , Morgaine 's office assistant - the perky , petite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strumpet , the whole world knew , was fashion-model tall , " but not as skinny as one of those masochistic walking clothes-hangers . I'm. quite nicely padded in fact , from addiction to Cheesecake Factory goodies . In a perfect world , they 'd use me as their spokeswoman ! " She possessed a " tawny mane of curls that owes more to nurture than nature - nurture being defined as the tender ministrations of the fabulous Mr. Jean . " She liked to dress casually , especially for her rough-and-tumble job as videocam operator for a cable news program . But she could stun a room of men when really dolled up , like that time when she crashed the UN reception for President Putin . ( It was at the UN that she had met Esteban Badura , who was present so far from his sheep to testify about global warming in his South American homeland . ) The woman who entered the office now matched many of the Sally Strumpet specs . But Riley could immediately tell she was n't right for the impersonation . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The planes of her cheeks looked like they had been sharpened on a grindstone . Without being invited , the woman sat down and crossed her legs as if she were Sharon Stone under interrogation . Spotting Morgaine 's dead cigar , she took that icon as permission to light up a cigarette of her own . " This gig include medical coverage ? " Cos I 've got this pre-existing condition- " Riley rolled his eyes , trying to signal Morgaine to cut this interview short . But the agent was politely persisting in questioning the woman , as if she could ever possibly stand in for Sally Strumpet . Once the first candidate left , Morgaine turned hopefully to Riley . " So , what 'd you think ? " " Harv , I would sooner dress up in drag myself than hire that woman . She would disgrace Sally 's good name . Jesus , I thought she was going to slit both our throats for the sheer thrill of it with those daggers she called fingernails ! " " All right , maybe she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The next woman radiated more of Sally 's innocent joie de vivre . But when she saw Morgaine 's library she uttered a brazen squawk and said , " Jesus , look at all them books ! What 're you guys anyway , perfessers ? " The third candidate also failed Riley 's inspection when she opened her mouth . But it was not her choice of words , but rather the timbre of her voice , which sounded like Fran Drescher 's filtered through George Burns 's vocal cords . And so the afternoon went , each succeeding woman presenting some fatal flaw of either looks , character , or intelligence . Four hours after they had started , both Morgaine and Riley were exhausted and dispirited . " I thought number twelve had potential - " Morgaine gamely ventured . " You mean potential to fall forward onto her face at any minute ? Oh , excuse me , her face would never hit the ground ! I 've never seen such an outrageous boob job . She had to have ten pounds of silicone in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wistfully at the memory . " I was going to ask you if we could alter the next printing of your book to include some amplified chest dimensions for Sally , but I guess you would n't - " Riley surged abruptly out of his chair , nearly tipping it over . " Damn it , Harv , that tears it ! It 's bad enough I created this monster in the first place , but I 'm certainly not giving her retroactive knockers bigger than her head ! Like none of the previous readers would even notice the changes , either ! Look , I 'm going home now . Call me when you need me again . " " That 'll be tomorrow . Those women all came from just one agency , and I 've got dozens of others lined up . " " Wonderful , just wonderful . I can hardly wait . " IN THE TAXI back to his apartment , Riley was plagued by a kaleidoscope of shifting faces . All the mock-Sally Strumpets he had interviewed rose and fell before his mind 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all been just close enough to the " real " Sally to freak Riley out . He felt that some malign deity had stolen his brainchild and warped her over and over again , creating twisted versions of his ideal . When Sally had existed only in Riley 's mind , she had been utterly self-consistent and authentic . Her transfer to the printed page had diluted her nature and character a trifle . But this final attempt at actually instantiating her in the flesh threatened to corrupt her entirely . Was it possible for a Platonic ideal ever to manifest in this degenerate realm ? Yet cruel circumstances dictated that he had to continue trying . How he would find the strength to face tomorrow 's interviews and any subsequent ones , he could not say . When success had finally visited Riley , he had immediately done two things . He had quit Royale magazine - not in a thundering fit of denunciation ; after all , he had not been mistreated , and the amiable if dead-end job had paid the rent - and he had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitchen he had moved to a modest co-op on the Upper East Side . Doorman , concierge , snooty neighbors , expensive little pampered dogs , the whole works . Riley had n't enjoyed his new living quarters as thoroughly as he had thought he would . The sterility of the neighborhood depressed him . But he felt his new status as a best-selling ( anonymous ) author required him to live in such respectable terrain . Up in his co-op , Riley kicked off his shoes , took a beer from his immaculate Sub-Zero fridge and slumped down in front of his theater-sized TV . With alcohol and cable , he vowed to shut his brain off for the night . Halfway through a rerun of WAo Wants to Create a Reality Show ? , there came a rather assertive knocking on Riley 's door . Muzzy from his fourth beer , he staggered to answer the summons . Halfway to the door , he wondered who could be visiting him , and how they had gotten past the building 's staff without Riley being informed . Riley tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to focus . " Screw it . " He twisted the handle and yanked the door inward , banging it into his unshod toes . " Jesus Christ ! " Riley bent to soothe the aggrieved foot . When he straightened , his visitor had impertinently stepped inside . Sally Strumpet wore black jeans , nicely packed , and scuffed red leather clogs . A ratty leather jacket gaped open to reveal a white button-front shirt over an ample but not outrageous bosom . Her irrepressible mass of curls was partially tamed by a scrunchy , but a few tendrils escaped to frame her face . She stood an inch or two taller than Riley , and her smile was the same one she had displayed when she had triumphed over weather-girl Gwen York , her hated rival , for the affections of Jack Burleigh , the newsman at the station where they all worked . Riley 's brain threatened meltdown . Disaster klaxons seemed to fill his ears . Yet somehow he could still hear Sally clearly when she spoke . Her voice was as poignantly real as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anas Nin 's pornography . " I understand you 've been looking for me , so here I am . Are you alone now ? Is this a good time ? " " Who - who are you ? " The question was meaningless in the face of Sally 's majestic presence , but Riley could summon up no other words . Sally stepped boldly inside and closed the door behind her . " Oh , I think you know quite well who I am , Mr. Big . " The woman winked and grinned at this play on Riley 's surname , but when Riley remained stonefaced , her brave expression cracked a little . " Unless you 've forgotten me so soon ? " Riley found himself somehow on the far side of the room from the woman , his instinctive retreat stopped only by the windows that afforded him a minuscule view of Central Park when he craned awkwardly . " You 're some kind of actress . You have to be . You ca n't be Sally Strumpet . She does n't exist . I invented her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back like a lazy tiger , lending a disturbing prominence to her chest . " Do I really look like some cheap figment of your imagination ? You can believe whatever you want about my origins , but you ca n't deny I 'm real . " Sally slapped her generous butt . " At least that 's what the scale tells me every morning . " Riley began to grow irritated . " You have to be a joke , right ? Well , it 's not funny . Who sent you ? How did you get this address ? Are you from one of the tabloids ? Where 's the camera ? " Riley could just see his goofy face plastered all over Page Sixes around the globe under the headline HOAX AUTHOR UNMASKED , FALLS FOR His OWN SCAM . The intruder assumed a truly crestfallen look that verged on the tearful . " Gee , Mr. Oh-So-Big , I know I 'm not much to look at or every man 's dream date , but no girl likes having her very identity denied . Are you asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sheepish at his rudeness . Whoever this woman was , she had done nothing yet to earn his disrespect . Better to take her at her impossible word and see where such a tactic led . " All right then , you 're Sally Strumpet . What are you doing here ? " Sally brightened up into a semblance of mild outrage . " I'm. pissed ! You 're trying to find someone to impersonate me . I do n't want some cheap tramp parading around the world and abusing my image like a street-vendor 's knockoff Prada handbag . Those girls you interviewed today were all dimwits and roundheels ! " Roundheels . That was an archaic term Riley loved and one which he had put in Sally 's mouth on more than one occasion . " How - how did you- ? " Sally winked . " Oh , I see a lot of things . Anyhow , you do n't need to look any further for someone to hide your authorship behind . You 've got me now . Tomorrow morning , you 're going to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll go in and meet with him to start arranging my public appearances . " Riley considered the ultimatum . This woman , whoever she was , looked and acted so much like Sally Strumpet that no other candidate could possibly compete . Sure , she was brash and crazy , maybe a stalker even , bursting in on him like this instead of just showing up at Morgaine 's office during the auditions with the other candidates . But why not accept fate , and use her as she proposed ? " Suppose I agree to your plan ? What 're your terms ? " Sally waved the question aside . " Oh , I 'm sure we can work out something mutually agreeable . " " Well , okay , then . I guess we 've got a deal . " Riley extended his hand to shake , fully expecting to encounter the grip of a ghost . But Sally 's handshake was firm and warm . " Now , where can I reach you tomorrow ? " Sally shucked off her jacket and threw it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clogs . " Right here , if it 's okay with you . I do n't have any other place to stay at the moment . And I figure that since my life story bought this place , I 've got as much right to be here as you . Unless you 're seeing someone else these days . It would n't be the first time a guy ditched me after I helped him reach success . " Riley hardly knew how to respond . He did owe his current stature to Sally Strumpet . But this woman was n't her - was she ? How could she be ? He had invented Sally ! Yet this familiar stranger acted so certain of her own identity Riley contemplated another lonely night spent in his empty bed . " No , I 'm not seeing anyone else . You can stay . " " Great ! " The couch received Sally 's shapely butt alongside her jacket . She smiled wickedly up at Riley and patted a cushion . " Now , have a seat . Relax . We 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Intense private conversation between a man and a woman is the high road to a lowdown activity . ' " She giggled and looked at Riley with a becoming blush creeping across her cheeks . " God , I 've never actually said that to a man before . But I know that you above anyone will understand . " Riley had never seen Harvard Morgaine at a loss for words . The agent was generally unflappable , ready with a rude comeback or salty quip for any circumstance . But encountering the forceful reality of the woman who refused to answer to any name other than " Sally Strumpet " left Morgaine deflated , empty of easy rejoinders or useful conclusions . Riley and his agent sat unaccompanied in Morgaine 's office . Sally had been dispatched on a shopping trip with Morgaine 's assistant , Nia Poole , abetted by the agency 's credit card . Along with her lack of residence , Sally claimed not to have any current wardrobe other than the clothes on her back . That deficit was being remedied even as Riley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . " She did n't lay any claim to my royalties then ? " " No , not a cent . She signed the contract I had ready without a second 's hesitation . Salary of five thousand a week for an unspecified period . She quoted one of the sutras : " Needy girls do not have to be greedy girls . ' " " Number fourteen . " " Whatever . It 's damn good money , sure , but not a patch on what she might 've asked for , if she really is sticking to this crazy claim that she 's the one and only Sally Strumpet , author of your book . " Morgaine took the dead cigar from his mouth and studied it a long moment before speaking again . " And Christ knows , I might 've sided with her if she pushed the claim . Sorry , kid , but she 's that good . " " You 're telling me . I almost believe her insane story myself . " Riley recalled what had happened last night . Several hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riley on everything in Sally 's life that had purportedly occurred to her since the close of secret Sutras . Not once did she depart from the implicit assertion that she was the fictional heroine of Riley 's book . Her narrative had been utterly consistent with the events of the book , forming a sequel that Riley might have written himself . He experienced a genuine pang at the sad fate of handsome shepherd Esteban Badura , lost to a rapacious melanoma engendered by the ozone hole over his native land . Riley even felt himself tearing up when Sally recounted how her Tierra del Fuegan in-laws had heroically taken over the shepherding duties , allowing Sally to return to the U.S.A. and seek solace in work and possibly even a new companion . Imagine Sally 's surprise when she had found herself a celebrity thanks to a certain book . Afterward , as half-promised , Riley and Sally had indeed moved to the bedroom . There , Riley experienced what was simply the best sex of his life . He was hardly surprised that he knew intimately all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , he had invented her , right ? It was like God knowing what went on in , say , a cat 's brain . The congraity between Sally 's desires and Riley 's moves engendered in Riley a greater confidence than any he had ever felt before while in bed with a woman . Even if this impossible incarnation of Sally failed to fulfill Morgaine 's need for a PR campaign beard , she was doing wonders for Riley 's libido . But there was one creepy thing about their lovemaking : Sally 's ability to anticipate all of Riley 's specific desires . How could the creation know the creator so well ? Had this happened with Galatea and her sculptor ? Riley began to wonder who really filled which role , and grew slightly nauseated with a kind of freshman existential angst . But he was n't truly spooked until , on the verge of sleep , Sally quoted the twenty-fifth sutra : " ' The only thing better than afterplay late at night is foreplay early in the morning . ' " Having heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay awake staring at the ceiling for the next three hours . There were only two dozen sutras in the published book , one for each chapter . In an early draft , Riley had indeed included a twenty-fifth , the very maxim Sally had just quoted . But no one , not even Harvard Morgaine , had ever seen that deleted chapter . Riley had been saving that twenty-fifth sutra for a sequel . Morgaine snapped his fingers in front of Riley 's face . " Do n't go catatonic on me so soon , Small . I need you to keep your head screwed on straight during this charade . It 's going to be a year and half , more likely two , until the movie debuts and we can gradually phase this chick out . We 're going to have to work hand in glove with her all that time . If she 's going to send you to la-la land every time you think about her , then we 've got a problem . We need you to ride herd on her in public and feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've talked to her , Harvard . She knows the book better than I do . And as for improvising , she 's more totally in character than de Niro . And what do you mean , " ride herd on her ? ' " " I 've got it all set up . You 're her publicist now . You 'll accompany her everywhere , make sure she does n't flip out and screw us over somehow . I even got you a salary from Aleatory House ! After all , before today , they did n't know you even existed in any other role . " " Oh , now , Harvard , wait just a goddamn minute - " " There 's no backing out , Small . We ca n't just turn this broad loose unsupervised . And I ca n't do the hand-holding , I 've got a fricking literary agency to run . Look at it this way : it 's the exact same schedule you 'd have to follow if you were actually known in public as the author , but this way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Jesus , this is totally humiliating . To stand there in the shadows like a flunky while she gets all the glory.I ca n't believe this . " " Believe it - or else . " Laden with packages , Sally and Nia returned several hours later , hours which Riley had spent pissily bemoaning his lot to a hard-hearted Morgaine . Sally dumped an armful of Bergdorf boxes into Riley 's lap . " Whew ! I 'm exhausted . " " Why ? " Riley asked . " What 's my favorite color , Mr. Big ? " " Uh , pumpkin . " " Correctomundo . You have any idea how hard it is to find a matching bra , thong and sandals in pumpkin ? " THE NEXT THREE MONTHS of Riley Small 's life were composed of equal parts boredom , jealousy , pride , humiliation and excruciating bliss . He felt like a torture victim who had earned conjugal visits between sessions on the rack . The debut of Sally Strumpet caused a firestorm in the media akin to the release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seclusion , the author of the sexy bestseller was as much in demand as a close-mouthed presidential advisor at a congressional hearing . Sally was booked onto every possible TV show , from dawn to the wee hours of the morning . Any time left free in her schedule was devoted to print interviews and photo shoots . Charity events and award galas thrummed to her triumphant , engaging presence . The hottest clubs in Manhattan and L.A. played host to her leisure-time , paparazzi-attracting activities . Sally endeared herself to her public by her general air of gawky competence and klutzy charm . The disaster she caused on Regis and Kelly 's show , for instance , with the exploding quiche , caused a million female viewers to bond with her instantly . But one phenomenon that truly frightened Riley was the way that real people stepped out from the woodwork claiming to know Sally and to be the originals of figures in her book . Their impossible assertions bestowed on Sally even more existential validity and heft . Riley found it particularly hard , for instance , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading group . Not just because he had invented them all - had n't he ? - but because one of them , Lynda Gorodetsky , was an ardent manhater and stared poisonous daggers at Riley throughout the entire meal they all shared . Despite his unease throughout the mad whirl , Riley stayed by her side in the role of humble publicist . Ignored by anyone of importance , forced ; to listen over and over to the same line of inane chatter about his misbegotten bestseller , he felt his grip on sanity slipping . Occasionally , when Sally performed particularly well , Riley could take some pleasure in hearing certain bon mots from his novel rendered in a witty manner . But for the most part , the whole concept of Sally and her libidinous escapades quickly palled for Riley , especially after that time on Oprah 's show when , as he lurked in the Green Room , Sally began describing her current sex life with him . The anecdotes were all flattering - too flattering , perhaps and she did n't use his name . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left burning nonetheless . Sally herself , up close in tangible form , presented even more challenges . Ms. Strumpet had elected to continue living at Riley 's digs . And to continue occupying his bed . Even when the pair were on the road , she managed to sneak into Riley 's room late at night when all the tabloid swarm had dissipated . She seemed to have no interest in taking any other lovers , despite myriad opportunities . Remarkably , sex with Sally managed to remain at the same high peak of their first encounter . Nonetheless , Riley felt simultaneously fulfilled and unsatisfied , as if he were screwing a woman created to match his exact desirability specs , but one who could never surprise him . Riley could n't figure out why he continued to remain as Sally 's lover . Did she satisfy all his needs in a healthy manner , or simply cancel them out like a key fitting into a lock ? Was he good for her , or merely a programmed response ? He tried to speak to Sally about these paradoxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out , so long as certain topics regarding her origin and his slave status were ignored . But all she did was quote sutra number nine to him : " " The more familiar a woman becomes to a man , the less he knows about her . ' " On a day that was remarkably free of commitments back in Manhattan , Riley went to see Harvard Morgaine . ( Sally was busy getting her hair done . ) Morgaine ushered Riley heartily into his office . " Welcome home , kid . I could n't be happier about how things are going . I assume you 're monitoring your bank account hourly , just like me . Sales of the book are way , way up of course , and the first check from Miramax has cleared . I hope you appreciated how many points I negotiated for our share of the box office . I was absolutely brilliant ! You 're a lucky bastard to have me for an agent , kid ! " Morgaine 's joyous avarice left Riley even more dispirited than when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take any of this secret Sutras stuff anymore . I 'm ready to crack . I need a vacation . " " A vacation ? Well , why not ! Sally is unsinkable now after all she 's been through . And if she was planning to shaft us , she 'd have done it by now . Hit the road , kid , and have yourself a ball . " " You - you 'll tell Sally I 'm leaving , okay ? But not where I 'm going . Because I ca n't - " Morgaine clapped Riley on the back . " Sure , no problem . Leave her to me . " Feeling somewhat more hopeful , Riley went to the travel agent closest to Morgaine 's office and booked a flight leaving that day for Cancun , before he changed his mind or Sally could change it for him . Twelve hours later he was sitting by a palm-fronded bar sipping a mojito . Despite the presence of a poster of Sally 's smiling face , with text in Spanish advertising Las Sutras Secretas de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages . A weight seemed to have been lifted off his shoulders . He could breathe again . His soul floated lightly inside him . For the next week , Riley led a mindless existence , soaking up sun and rum , swimming , admiring women who were n't Sally . He began to believe that there would be some kind of life for him outside of the whole secret Sutras morass . Eventually , one thing led to another and Riley found himself one langorous afternoon undressing in the room of a very attractive blonde legal secretary from Duluth named Sharon . After a long embrace and kiss , Sharon excused herself . " Get in bed , honey . I 'll be right back . " Riley watched her disappear into the bathroom from his recumbent vantage on the tropic-patterned sheets . Despite his excitement , he felt a little drowsy , and half-closed his eyes . Not more than a minute could 've passed before Sharon reappeared , wrapped in a towel . She did not bound amorously toward the bed , but instead seemed preoccupied , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Eventually she turned her head . As soon as she saw Riley , she screamed . " Who are you ! What 're you doing here ! " Riley jumped up , all his lust deflated by her shriek . " Sharon , that 's not funny . You invited me in . We were going to make love . My name 's Riley - " " Get out ! Get out ! " Riley hastily dressed and scrammed . For the rest of the day he waited nervously in his room , every minute expecting to be approached by a resort executive or , worse , a corrupt and tyrannical Mexican police officer who would demand that Riley explain his rapist ways . But no such confrontation occurred , and finally Riley managed to fall uneasily asleep , even without supper . In the morning he was awakened by the sound of his own door opening . In walked what was obviously a honeymooning couple escorted by a lowly hotel employee burdened with baggage . When the newcomers spotted Riley in bed , there was much confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this room was supposed to be vacant . Once the intruders had been shooed off , Riley dressed and went to speak to the manager , with whom he had developed a casual relationship . The portly , mustached man regarded Riley as if he were an undistinguished new species of bug . " I 'm sorry , Senor , but I must contradict your account of our mutual friendship established this past week . Especially as we have no record of your registration at our resort . Obviously there has been some mistake . You will have to register for the first time - for the second time , if you insist - or else vacate your room . " Riley felt spectral hands on his shoulder , claws knotting in his guts . He chose to vacate . At the airport , he was relieved to discover that his open-dated return ticket was still accepted at face value . The inspection of his passport was cursory . Just as well . Riley suspected that the document would not hold up any longer to in-depth confirmation by authorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi dropped Riley off at the door of his co-op , he was trembling with exhaustion and trepidation . Wearily manhandling his bag , he approached the doorman . " How may I help you , sir ? Whom do you wish to visit ? " Riley stiffened in shock . Not here , too - " Aw , c'm on , Jeff , it 's me , Riley Small . I live in 1203 - " A veil of disgust dropped over the doorman 's features and he lost all semblance of good manners . " Another groupie for Ms. Strumpet , huh ? How many of you guys do I have to get arrested before you all get the message ? " Riley set off jogging , his bag pitilessly thumping his vertebrae . At Harvard Morgaine 's office , Nia Poole erected a formidable barrier of professional indifference toward this intruder claiming he was a Morgaine client , but Riley finally managed to get admitted to Morgaine 's inner sanctum on the strength of some personal details about Morgaine that he disclosed . Nia seemed shocked by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grosser pecadillos . Morgaine 's clean-shaven , rugged face wore a look of barely concealed irritation . " Now , Mr. Small , is it ? What brings you here today ? Something about Secret Sutras , my assistant said . " Riley poured out the whole story . Morgaine listened without comment . Riley dared to hope he had finally found a believer in the strange fate that had overtaken him . But Morgaine 's subsequent speech shattered that last illusion . " Mr. Small , rest assured that my client Sally Strumpet will pursue all her legal options against anyone who contests her authorship of her book . To put it bluntly , the full weight of the law will come down on you like a circus tent full of elephant dung . Why you wannabe writers feel compelled to fantasize like this about celebrities - " Riley fled in mid-bluster , something he had often wanted to do with Morgaine but had never before dared . Being a non-entity had its liberating moments . Googling Sally 's homepage at the library 's public-access terminal , Riley learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very Union Square store where he had first been inspired to write Secret Sutras . Low on cash , dubious of the validity of his credit cards , Riley spent the night on a bench in the park behind the library . He was at the store several hours before Sally 's slated signing , looking like a half-drowned sailor . He killed time at the caf on one of the upper floors , nursing a coffee and muffin . Half an hour in advance of the signing , Riley had positioned himself unobtrusively near the table stacked high with copies of Secret Sutras , so that he could see without being seen . When Sally entered , Riley was relieved to note that she seemed to be unaccompanied by any flunkies . Sally read from chapter four and her reading was , as usual , flawless , and she fielded the usual audience questions gracefully . Afterward , she took her seat behind the table set up with mountains of her book . Her book ! The line for autographs already stretched across the store and out the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been more annoyed than pleased at the immense turnout , contemplating all the inane small talk he would have to make , the dumb misprisioned praise he would have to listen to , and the pains his wrist would endure . But Sally , to the contrary , seemed all earnest sunshine and good will , gratitude and flirtatiousness . Why oh why had he made her so damn noble ? She must have sold and signed two hundred books . Riley could feel the painful extraction of every cent of royalties that should have gone into his pocket , every leaking ounce of karma that should have been his . No wonder he was turning invisible . After a fulsome round of congratulations from the elated , sales-inebriated store manager , when Sally finally seemed ready to leave , Riley trailed her out . He accosted her half a block away , when she stopped to hail a taxi . " Hey , you bitch ! I want my life back ! " Sally turned and coolly regarded Riley from her superior height . Her gorgeous face seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had first formed . " You ran out on me , " Sally said . " That was not appreciated . Do n't you remember my seventh sutra ? " A woman 's wounded heart is like a wounded lion . You 'd better pray it never recovers its health and gets nosing on your trail . ' " Suddenly Riley 's consciousness inverted and projected itself through space . He seemed to be regarding himself with Sally 's eyes , gauging himself with Sally 's emotions . The father became the brainchild fully for the first time . Realization of the existential obligations he had placed on Sally by creating her crashed over him like a tsunami . Flop sweat soaked his clothes . He felt like God on trial at some cosmic Hague courtroom . A few seconds later , Riley was back in his own head . But all the fight had gone out of him , leaving him as stinkingly droopy as a bartender 's rag . " You 're right . I 'm a rat . So I 'm leaving again now , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sally smirked victoriously , but not without a margin of charity . " Oh , so you want to make the same mistake twice ? Not exactly a quick learner . " Riley halted . " What do you mean ? " " Why not ask me if I want you back ? " " Do you ? " " Sure . Were n't we created for each other ? " Riley could practically hear cosmic theme music swelling in the background . He knew then that just as he had created Sally , Someone Up There had created him , devised this fate for him , and that both Riley and Sally were equal in the eyes of this irony-fixated deity . " I ca n't deny it , " Riley said . " But are you really willing to give me a second chance after I ditched you and cheated on you ? " " I might be . If I heard the three little words every gal is truly longing to hear . " Riley felt the requested phrase surface almost involuntarily from his diaphragm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to utter it . For one thing , he was n't sure of what he felt . For another , he resented being coerced . But declaiming his passion seemed the only way to get his life back . " I -I love you , Sally . " Sally grinned like a cat with a mouse 's tail hanging from its jaws . " There , that was n't so hard , was it ? Although you used four , arguably five words instead of three . Tsk , tsk , not economical for a writer of your talents . Now c'm on , here 's a cab . We 've got to get you cleaned up and looking handsome for the dinner tonight with Sonny Mehta . " Riley numbly tumbled after Sally into the taxi , and the car drove off . Churning , confused thoughts about his future revolved through his head . But one thing he knew for sure . There was another book waiting inside his brain . A book just as powerful as that which had created Sally Strumpet . A book of harsher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sequel . Anyone .
