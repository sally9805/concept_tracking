Do n't come back from the bush bushwhacked . Recover on Tanzania 's island retreat . Edited by Heidi Mitchell THE AFRICAN SAFARI , if designed for you personally , can be the romantic adventure of a lifetime . When my wife , Virginia , and I were planning our first one , two years ago , a friend who is a veteran of many safaris advised us to contact Africa Calls , a boutique company run by Babette and Christina Alfieri , a mother-daughter team who together have more than four decades of experience arranging truly customized bush tours . ( With her partner , Phil Berry , a renowned naturalist-guide , Babette also runs the remote , six-guest Kuyenda Bush Camp , in Zambia . ) After participating in the exciting activities of five camps , in three countries , that the Alfieris had recommended , and witnessing such scenes as a pride of lionesses killing a zebra , only to be chased away by four growling males , who then swatted away seventeen cubs that were trying to join the feast , Virginia and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was one thing we should have done differently . We made the mistake of going from our twenty-day expedition directly back to the States , a long trip that dissipated some of our Nirvana . We decided that if we were ever to go again , we would remain in Africa for a few additional days to enjoy some reflective recuperation time . Photograph : The Palms ' main pool and lodge . Photograph by Nicholas Pitt That , then , is precisely what we did last year when , after returning to Africa and traveling to four camps in Tanzania during a two-week period , we took off from Dar es Salaam on a plane bound for Zanzibar . Zanzibar ! The very name conjures up storybook images of spices , sultans and centuries of intrigue and warring invaders , but our friends at Africa Calls assured us it was just the place for a luxurious respite before heading home . Fifteen minutes after leaving Dar es Salaam , on Tanzania 's east coast , and skipping over the pale-turquoise water of the Indian Ocean , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zanzibar archipelago , which joined the mainland country of Tanganyika to form Tanzania in 1964 . As we started our descent , Stone Town , the main city on the largest island ( also named Zanzibar ) , appeared before us , its mosques , forts and towers giving it a decidedly Oriental look . Everywhere there were vestiges of coral rock , which has been used for centuries in building houses and roads and which , in its powdery form , constitutes the delicate white sand that circles this roughly 650-square-mile island . Many visitors stay in Stone Town , which has several comfortable hotels , but on Babette and Christina 's recommendation , we had made reservations at the Palms Zanzibar , one of the island 's sumptuous oceanfront retreats . After an hour 's drive to the southeastern coast , we arrived at the gates of the Palms , which opened in 2002 and is owned by the Raguz family , a Kenyan clan of European descent . The property 's namesake palms towered above its grounds , and true to its location in these " spice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their many spice-growing plantations , the air had a soft , enticing fragrance . The adults-only Palms was serenity itself . Perched on a rise overlooking riotously blooming gardens and adjacent to Plantation House , the main building , where the library-lounge , bar and restaurant are located , six stone villas faced an expanse of calm ocean . After our invigorating but relatively primitive days in the bush , where we had to make appointments for two-minute warm-water showers , the Palms indeed offered a place to recover . Photograph : The resort 's plantation style includes canopied beds in the villas . In the living room of our one-bedroom villa , the sofa and chair were covered with damask , and silk curtains billowed at the windows . The bedroom harbored a huge canopied bed , and the bathroom a spacious sunken tub , with the whole accommodation , at 1,500 square feet , conveying colonial grandeur . The veranda featured an inviting antique daybed , beside which was our own private plunge pool ( there is a large communal pool next to the main lodge ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white-powder sand beach , was a thatch-covered cabana called a banda , which was reserved expressly for us . It had a king-size mattress with an array of oversized pillows and lacy curtains to ensure privacy . The surf was relatively tranquil , and every afternoon women in colorful kangas ( saronglike garments wrapped around the head and body ) were seen toting burlap bags in the distant shallows as they harvested prized seaweed destined , we later learned , for upscale Japanese restaurants . It was a scene worthy of Czanne or Gauguin . And worthy of a medieval sultan was the pampering that the Palms provided ( there are fifty staff members for about twelve to fifteen guests , typically ) , with elaborate sundowners served at the beach cabanas ; snorkeling and fishing forays ; and private trips to the remarkable Jozani Forest . On top of all this , there was the Palms Sanctuary , a spa situated in an exotic structure fashioned after a sultan 's bathhouse , where massages by Thai and Balinese women were available by candlelight . After a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return briefly to the real world . The Palms provided us with a car and a guide , and we headed to Stone Town for what turned out to be a thrilling immersion in a mix of ancient cultures . Portuguese , Egyptians , Turks , Omani Arabs , Persians , Britons  --  all these and more have left their imprint on this well-preserved trading port , which UNESCO named a World Heritage Site in 2000 . With a current population of about 200,000 , the city traces its history back to 4000 B.C. , when early hominoid people from the mainland came to Zanzibar in dugout canoes  --  the first of numerous waves of adventurers who , by the 19th century , were drawn here in pursuit of the cloves and other spices that flourished in the tropical climate , as , unfortunately , did Zanzibar 's market for the sale of African slaves . In the teeming , dingy labyrinth of the town 's narrow streets , ancient coral-stone buildings lean against one another to form a shield against the punishing sun ; in fact , the houses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upper-story window and shake hands with a neighbor across the street . Amid the jostling streets there were particular sites to see , such as the vast Darajani Market . Filled with the tangy aroma of spices , it overflowed with masses of fish displayed in huge stone basins and carcasses of meat hanging alongside various fowl . Also of interest was the crenellated Old Fort , built around 1700 , after the Omani Arabs ousted the Portuguese . Not to be missed were the small underground holding pens , left over from the 1800s , in which slaves were brutally packed prior to their being sold at auction by Arab traders . Late in the day , Virginia and I went to the Africa House Hotel for a drink on its vast veranda , which abuts the ocean . As the sun began to set , dhows sailed by , muezzins in their towers called the faithful to prayer , bells rang out , and evening sounds filled the air . Zanzibar is a moderate Muslim society , and perhaps because of its long history of mixing cultures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by all accounts , with the city 's forty-eight mosques . Muslim women are not required to cover their faces  --  a rare freedom in an Arab culture  --  but many voluntarily swathe the tops of their heads and their shoulders , if not their entire bodies , in kangas . Often these are printed with irreverent sayings , such as " Do n't abandon an old rug for a passing mat " and " You can say and do what you like , I have him in my bed . " There is poverty , to be sure , both in and outside Stone Town . Although all Zanzibaris have free medical coverage and schooling is compulsory , the 4,500 people who live in the village nearest to the Palms reside in tin-roofed huts with no running water . Many of them fish for a livelihood , bartering some of their catch for vegetables , fruit and other commodities ; others work in Stone Town . Still , when we visited the village from the Palms , people were friendly toward us , and we did not feel uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd seen printed on one kanga : " Do n't set sail using somebody else 's star . " Perhaps that Zanzibari philosophy applies even in the face of harsh reality . I highly recommend visiting one of the island 's numerous spice plantations . Our guide stripped samples off the trees and bushes to show us the raw material that is turned into turmeric , tandoori paste , masala and saffron , pointing out ginger and various chiles as well . Some of the farms cultivate the ylang-ylang tree , which produces clusters of the white flower that Coco Chanel 's master perfumer , Ernest Beaux , used in creating her No. 5 perfume , in 1921 . Returning to the Palms in the evenings after our outings , we enjoyed a succession of memorable dinners . On one occasion a beautifully appointed table was set up outside our villa , with a full moon reflected in a ribbon of light that glinted off the ocean . Another time we were serenaded in the restaurant by a remarkable Zanzibari band : flute , drums , tambourines , violins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four singers . On our final night we dined outside the Sanctuary , on a platform right at the ocean 's edge . Many of the other guests who were staying at the Palms had , like us , come off safaris , but one couple was there to celebrate a twenty-fifth wedding anniversary , and two were on their honeymoon . I 'm quite sure that , if requested , the Palms would put ylang-ylang blossoms beside the honeymooners ' beds . In fact , the staff probably did that anyway .
