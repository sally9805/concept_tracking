She hears the bear outside her dream-the charred corpse driving her away from a flaming city-before she wakes up . She has never seen a bear , except in a zoo , but she does not extricate her body from the boiling quilt or crawl to the window . Midnight in this national forest feels dangerous to her , too raw a sky , uncontrolled stars , connoting all time , complete without her . The man beside her ( she searches her sleep-numbed mind for his name , Claus ) lies on his back , sucking in breath , not letting it out , until it accrues a smothered groan . His restless white legs generate sweat . Tatters of cornsilk hair , circumscribing his naked scalp , glow in moonlight that sizzles through boughs of pine . No , the image of heat seems misplaced ; in the mountains east of Togwotee Pass , the August nights are already freezing . <p> Alert , she deduces that the bear is breaking up the empty Styrofoam cooler she left on the rotted slats that serve as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has before , beginning with the leftover spaghetti the neighbor tossed out of his trailer for squirrels . The single-minded crunching rips , foam giving way to claws or teeth , intrigue her , but she does n't get out of bed , or crawl to the sleeping-loft window . She finds herself with a new belief a wild beast deserves its secrets . Then she hears the bear move off , mounting a dogged brush unlike the snapping twigs that signify bounding white-tailed deer . Her insistent dream reasserts itself : the man from New York , a swollen cadaver , pilots the car over smoking rock towers . Claus sleeps on but finds no peace ; sometimes he takes so long to exhale , she fears he 's died of a heart attack . When he moans she knows he , too , is dreaming , but not about what . <p> In a different part of the country , conspirators in the other 's fresh start , they 'd tacitly agreed not to describe nightmares , relics of the past , to one another . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this was nothing , he sleepwalked until he was seventeen , once wandered into his parents ' bedroom-they were getting it on-and punched his hand through a storm window . <p> " No way " she 'd laughed , and with his putto lips folded around a kiss-shaped grin , he might well have been joking . <p> From the start , his revelations seemed ironic , their truth a jest . She had focused on his impish humor , tongue-in-cheek , eclipsing the significance of his words . To begin with , she could n't recall talking to him , the Visiting Anthropologist , at the Dean 's party for new faculty , and forgot she 'd invited him to her place for dinner . A few hours after they met she 'd been hit by a car while crossing Grand Street , the small university town 's main drag . Dozing on the couch , bloody gauze slipping off her skull , she was startled when a tall , bald stranger bounded in , wearing a baby-blue Oxford shirt and Birkenstock sandals , bearing a clump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( since the accident her stuffed-up ears popped ) , she mistook him for the man she dreamed of who used to wheel his bicycle through her apartment door , nervously unlocked , in wide-apart dawns . Then taking in the trite bouquet , his uncool shoes , she rose , washed her gray face , scrawled on the mirror like a pencil mark , slashed on red matte lips , and opened a can of Geisha clams . <p> He reminded her where they 'd met . " Oh , right she said , but recollected only the Dean 's surprising leopard-print couch , nothing else , as she recalled crossing the snow-glazed street , inadequately lighted in the premature darkness of early November , but not being struck by the uninsured student driver . As she had focused on the attentive blue eyes , precisely shaped lips , and immaculate head of this unexpected suitor-a shiny , white head that must smell like glass-his Midwestern lack of accent failed to penetrate her labyrinths . Instead of listening , she lapsed into the ongoing struggle to remember getting tossed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contours of this fearful blurred moment , something she badly needed was lost . <p> According to him , it was on this first date that he 'd told her his father , " The Colonel , " had been diagnosed with syphilis after liberating a concentration camp . " You do n't remember a single word I said that night , " he later accused her in his neutral Plexiglas voice . The head wound , the doctor had warned her , might cause temporary short-term memory loss , but would n't she register a weird story like that ? All she recalled of their first conversation , over wine and the thrown-together linguine , minus unavailable flat-leafed Italian parsley , was a single sentence he 'd said : When I knew I was going to leave my marriage , I became the best husband I could . Startled by what that statement revealed about men , she had written it down in her journal . <p> The journal also informed her that like all middle-aged people they had talked about work : her poetry , the prize , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd spent finishing his Ph.D . in cultural anthropology , once he figured out what he wanted to do with his life . Predictably , they 'd moved to the subject of relationships . She worried that her busted head might have made her less reticent than she usually was with men she could n't imagine in bed . She knew she did tell him she 'd never been married , adding , " Freedom and marriage are mutually exclusive states . " <p> This line-she 'd used it often in New York-sounded prerecorded here , in a cavernous new life , what a talking doll croaked when a string was pulled on the back of its neck . But his eyes , pure blue , like sky encapsulated in an airplane window , remained on her face , their fascination never shrinking . She told him nothing about her past , or the lover she obsessively dreamed of , and what she feared had happened to him , shrouded by images in the poem she 'd started before the accident . She must have told him she planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , then go wherever the train was going , maybe back to New York , because when he called , a prompt two days later , he said , " I 'm glad the train has n't already left . " <p> In the morning Claus goes out to reconnoiter his Rockport walkers , claps their Vibram soles hard on the slats , beating off mud from yesterday 's hike . On the steep trail to Jade Lake , clotted with snow , melted and refrozen to a sherbet rime , he had hurried ahead of her , then compensated by dangling like a hung man , tongue stuck out , from a low pine branch . Mixing fresh lemon muffins for breakfast , she hears the echoing sole clap halt as he registers the ravaged cooler . Then he calls , " Hey , come out a minute . That bear was here last night ! " <p> Her eyes reluctantly track his accusing finger ; she murmurs , disinterested tones protecting the beast , " Yeah , I guess . " The cooler is not rendered into snowflake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched down the top , perforated the sides with claw digs , trailing into tetanus scrapes , and not finding food , wandered off . Its track is ornate : an oversized wavy palm with disengaged toes , resembling a necklace of Brazil nuts , preceded by pearl-drop claw marks , decorate the wet , gray mud . One paw , a rear one , resisting the weight above it , had squeezed up the muck . <p> Claus falls to his knees , ardently traces the footprint 's outline . " How big do you think it is ? " he asks . His interest , it seems to her , is suspiciously intense . <p> She curls her hands into claws and raises them high above her head . " Vat are you doink in my bed , dahlink ? " She recites the question from Goldilocks in an exaggerated Yiddish accent , strange to her own ears here where everyone is and talks like goyim : You bet , instead of " You 're welcome . " Clear over yonder . She 's forgotten how easy it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a fan . <p> The uninsured student driver told her she 'd exclaimed , " Oh , shit ! " on the snow-glazed sidewalk before she blacked out . Around the time she got together with Claus , she thought she could remember saying that . She could almost visualize her own body , uncoiled on the ice in a long black coat , as sirens wavered in the frozen dark . It was possible , though , that she had attached the sound of her own voice and the monotone bleep , unlike a New York siren 's drowning dog gulps , to what she was later told about the accident . Did she believe she 'd glimpsed the murky interior of the ambulance , a white-coated attendant hovering above her , because she knew an ambulance had come ? <p> She was n't surprised to wake up in the blue , coolly sterile hospital , nor worried about the lapses of clarity , her need to nap . She could still read and critique her students ' naive greeting-card verses , caramelized with souls , tears , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , had not been ejected through the gash in her head ; within a week she was drafting some exploratory verse with a longer , subtly accented line that seemed to embody oblivion . As she wrote about darkness watching her missing body , she invoked the burned man 's false , extended laugh , as , hands tied above his head , he floated on the rim of the ice-colored night , mocking her attempt to escape what he meant . <p> She found it incredible that after twenty years of city jaywalking she 'd gotten run over in a town with fewer inhabitants than her old Manhattan neighborhood . After she was released from the hospital , she returned to the crossing where the ambulance had collected her unconscious form to look for her shoe , a purple suede boot that had n't been on her left foot when they wheeled her into the emergency room . The icy wind upended the snowy street , shiny in the light from a distant lamp , or the cuticle moon . Whose hands had lifted her into the ambulance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck her ( and instantly forgot she had ever met him ) , she later imagined it was he who winged his way to her hospital bed , proffering his habitual half-dead posies , his eyes the sincere blue of a Delft pottery windmill . <p> The lemon muffins sink and deflate in the ancient gas stove ; the altitude , eight thousand feet , is too high for baking . Claus announces that he 's going to town , twenty miles east , to " indulge in a little bear research . " He stretches a tight , mischievous smile and winks , hops on his thick sock . He must sense she is wondering about the Arapaho gardens he is supposed to be measuring , because he turns his face away , deflecting questions . He does n't invite her to come with him , although the trip to town and back would give them a chance to talk when they talk best , driving to or away from the horizon line on unfurling asphalt . Their summer together in the rented cabin below the Continental Divide is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another sabbatical replacement post at a small Christian college in Orange County , and nothing between them has been resolved yet . <p> The university , with a stiff-jawed lack of comment , had not chosen him , the " inside candidate , " in the national search , hired a younger woman , working on sub-Saharan clitoridectomy , instead . She was angry for his sake , but more for her own , soon to be marooned in the strange , windy town alone , just as her life appeared to be settling into an innocuous , productive routine . It was publish or perish , would n't he know that ? But he had n't published his calorimetric study of Arapaho gardeners ; she was n't positive he 'd begun the research . She knew he had spent the August before they met at a folk dance camp , then practiced " the dancing , " as he called it , in his office , wearing down booties to muffle the thumps of his swift , one-legged dips to swoop a white handkerchief off the floor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than lithium , " and taught him more about transitional cultures than phony scientific experiments did . He had received the bad news , his dismissal , with a nonchalant shrug and a few rude quips about the " Coors cartons " the over-weight chairwoman carried on her hips , joked he might slash that ugly shiksa 's tires with his German saber before he left . <p> This black steel blade , taken by " The Colonel " off a dead Nazi officer in the Polish camp , was stored in the back seat of his rust  --  laced Accord with the plethora of nomadic Burger King cups , candy bar wrappers , an antique Prussian blunderbuss ( another of his father 's vicious war trophies ) , and a dull crosscut saw he had rescued from the tumultuous garage of his marriage . Shiksa was a Yiddish word he had picked up from her , but it made her uncomfortable to hear it emerge so blandly , pronunciation distorted , from his Waspy pink lips . <p> " What about us ? " The predictable female question surprised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , that he could n't ask her to follow him when he had nothing to offer . Next May he would have to check out of the Christian college , it was a one-year gig , and who knew where he would end up next ? In his usual bright , tongue-in-cheek tone , he said he could always sell previously owned vehicles in Granite City , like he did before he figured out what he wanted to do with his life . <p> Had he really been a used-car salesman ? He did know a lot about cars , how to keep old heaps , like his tottering Accord , running , how much they were worth . Still , she considered offering to go with him . Having given up the keys to the three rattling locks of her rent-controlled apartment , echoing with a silent caller 's rings , the most creative plan might be to keep moving . She would divide and mutate , dissolve her bad dreams in a kaleidoscope swirl of abstract locations . <p> " No gardens today ? " she asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , with a soft anger that made her flinch , neither smiling , winking , nor screwing up his face , not to yenta him . Now he waves his hand through the air as if erasing an invisible blackboard . " That late June snowstorm wiped out most of the rez 's corn and tomatoes . So much for academic bullshit , " he grins . <p> He had n't mentioned the frozen vegetables before ... though he must have been wildly depressed , knowing his research plan for the year was kaput . She could n't remember it snowing in June  --  she never paid attention to the dates of blizzards unless she had to drive in them-but it had snowed in July here in the mountains , brief , unseasonable flurries that melted as soon as they sugared the bristling meadow . When he fumes away in his rattletrap car without a back seat , she examines the bear 's footprint again : the pad of the paw , minus the toes , resembles a heart , eaten away on one side , as if a vulture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was honest with herself , she knew she owed her relationship with this anthropologist to a scene that suggested he , too , could inspire perilous yearning , like the man in New York . The other woman had risen up out of the ice-sleeved bushes in front of his apartment the first night she had slept with Claus . They had been out on a " redneck date , " as he 'd labeled their small-town romantic preludes , dining on greasy truck-stop patty melts , dancing beneath glass-eyed elk heads in The Buckhorn Bar . From the front seat of the trashed Accord , she witnessed the anguish in the naked hand the square-jawed blonde , wearing no hat , flung out to snatch his wrist , in the gaze her eyes shackled to his . He had mentioned another woman-not in " good shape , " her husband had shot himself in the head-said she did n't accept what he called " the breakup , " as if that same rupture had not happened to him . <p> The temperature was twenty below , a cold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had overdone the flowers that night ; the incongruous blood-red rosebuds , fifty of them , had wilted as soon as she pulled them out of their glassine wrapper , pricking her fingers on their armoring thorns , and now withered to a frigid rigor mortis where the back seat had been . It astounded her that with no way of knowing when , or even if , Claus would return , this woman had lain wait for him in the razor-blade cold that killed people stranded on highways , risking her life to communicate longing . She watched them speak , their eyes pulled into rapt connection by some soured intensity , that to her , the abandoned voyeur , posed an erotic question . She cracked the window , but their words , frozen balloons bobbing above them , did not surge in with the iceberg drift . <p> Yet , watching this silent scene beneath moon-lined clouds that chugged through the huge , windy sky , she could envision herself kneeling before the burned man at her birthday party , back in New York . She remembered why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final night , perfect full-blown blossoms , white , for snow , flung them on a drink-soaked table , then danced , the floor shifting his rooted , rocking grace , but not with her . Later , in the mice  --  filled bed , dusty with disintegrating plaster , he allowed her to reach beneath the maple-patterned rose silk kimono and caress his body , before he grew , as he always did after sex , inexplicably angry . When she 'd found the cigarette box full of foil-wrapped cocaine , dropped , maybe hidden , between the soiled Bedouin cushions , she understood he was not , probably never had been , a carpenter . <p> Witnessing Claus 's former woman 's self-destructive act had inspired a phantom pain of desire . Before that she had not been sure she 'd go on seeing Claus , thought after one of their silly redneck dates she would casually utter , feeling no loss , Look , this is n't right for me , then blow off this sensible university job and fly back to the city , to wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned man once told her he lived . But that freezing night , under a sleeping bag in Claus 's apartment , furnished with the car seat extracted from his doddering Honda , two pairs of skis , and a bar of soap , melting to a glue-like paste on the filthy sink , he had parted her knees with his large , pale hands , fingered her dark , wiry hair , and breathed , I want to run it through my teeth . She was amazed to find herself with a lover whose prominent veins traveled up milk-colored limbs like blue highways on a map . His chest , a field of transparent filaments , was hairier than she 'd thought a bald man 's could be . You take my breath away , he 'd said , a phrase he repeated whenever they made love-soon a predictable assembling of body parts . With astonishing ease they had become a couple , dating , their names linked by and , invited to potlucks with married professors who chatted about children and university planning . When she did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt triumphantly safe , like a woman who had saved her own life by becoming an impostor . <p> Renting the summer cabin near Togwotee Pass , driving distance from the Indian reservation , had been her idea . She could write in an unfamiliar natural world that might change the way her eyes traveled to objects in space , while he finished gathering data for his garden research . Arguments , the sort a normal woman might make , fell from her lips : after living together in the wilderness , would n't they know whether what there was between them was destined to last ? He had gazed at her intensely , face immobile , and said nothing , a silence she took to mean yes . <p> He 'd found it difficult to adjust to the cabin , though . He complained that the kitchen table , hewn from rough logs , was a bad place to write ; he needed more privacy , an office , something brighter than a kerosene lamp , an Internet connection , yadda , yadda . He drove restlessly to the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she believed , he fired up his laptop battery in the minuscule library before heading out to the reservation to measure vegetable gardens . Some days he did n't return until dark , tired , red-eyed , hairless head fiery and peeling , as if he 'd been dancing among the mauve rock parapets of the badlands without a hat . He said little at dinner , appeared withdrawn and distracted , picked at the lamb shanks she 'd made , or the white bean ravioli , or the chicken braised with vinegar and olives , and adamantly did not pet the adopted stray cat . <p> " Is everything all right ? " she asked him , disguising her anxious foreboding with lightness . " The Indians ? The cowboys ? The little doggies ? " <p> Usually he winced out a smile and turned up his hands , like an impresario garnering claps ; one night he 'd responded angrily , " Since you do n't want to know , you 'd better not ask . " <p> In her " office " in the rough-board shed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the bullet-shaped droppings and fronds of pine cones , peeled , like artichoke leaves , by rapacious red squirrels . From the bifurcated glass of the dusty window , patched with duct tape , she can see the crumbling pink-lobed mountain , foregrounding a dark island of browning thistles in a sweep of white gold grass . The uncomfortable new poem traces the meandering path of a gaze instead of the accelerated accents of a pounding heart . The cat , her constant companion , runs his licked paw pads over his ears . <p> When she glances up from her lavender notebook , the bear is where it always is when Claus is gone , about two hundred feet away in the Aspen grove , its bulky black shape interweaving with oblong leaves , turned , this chilly morning , to a crisp , mottled ochre . Her eyes follow the sun through the trees ' elastic lacings to a fur aureole radiating above the animal 's spine as it digs in the ground with its snout and paws . The stripped-down illuminated distance , less revealing than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinks it . She lowers her eyes , respecting the bear 's illusion that it remains unseen . A raptor transects the meadow , utters its hunting call . <p> The poem begins with cascading bursts of images : the hawk 's kreeeer , the bear 's mane of sun , tittering bells of shattered glass , the empty ring , a disassociated , stuttering line : I have to t-t-t-talk to you . It progresses in tumultuous , unshaped lines to the ghost of a bandaged hand , poised on his burned chest with the amazing three tits , beneath the painted fans of her own silk kimono , then winds to the familiar swollen corpse of her dream , driving her away from flaming skyscrapers . Back in New York , before she agreed to loan him the money , too late to save him , she had glimpsed his numb , frightened eyes , buried under layers of thick purple eyelid , and understood he did not possess the power she gave him . <p> Absorbed , she does n't hear Claus 's car drive in , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses . He has never come back so early in the day , or entered the shed without first calling her name , then rapping on the metal-crossed door hanging ajar on one rusty hinge . Now he bursts in , forgetting to duck , striking his head on the lopsided lintel , a low , splintery , nail-studded beam . She watches , hand pressed to mouth , as blood surges down his forehead to slide off his chin like viscous mud . <p> " Do n't scream , " he whispers . A flap of skin is detached from his head , as if he has literally scalped himself . His round face wraps around a cry he seems unable to utter ; he gasps , wobbles , but does n't fall . <p> She rises , mute , hands flung out , unable to touch him , floating away on a wave of blood . Reaching into his khaki pocket for a Kleenex , he swabs the sticky plasma dripping into his disorganized blond eyebrows . She is losing consciousness of her empty mouth , palms up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad as it looks , " he says weakly . From a distance she hears his words gulping like water in an obstructed drain : " I 've been beheaded like this before . They do n't make poets ' doors high enough ... " <p> In wind-tossed snow that flung frozen spume , the turning car , a gray compact model , rolled inexorably toward her ; she had seen it coming , not about to slow or stop , before she started across the street . Remembering this , she crashes toward the blood , pooling in blossom shapes on the floor 's ragged plywood . <p> " Did n't you see the bear ? " Claus 's padded voice muffles an angrier tone . Why had she crossed the street in the path of an oncoming vehicle ? It was five o'clock . She was n't tired , or drunk . It was as if she had floated out of her body to dwell somewhere else . Holding the Kleenex to the gash in his scalp , he gestures with his blood-smeared chin . " It was rooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The bear , unaware of human conflict , returned that night . She was already awake , her body sweaty , although sleet-filled rain silted the heavy boughs of pine . The cat must have spotted it through the sliding glass door , for he leaped , fur exploding , up the steps to the sleeping loft , where Claus , theoretically allergic to cats , did not allow him . She realized then that he was no longer beside her , was not curled into a fetal position around the canister of capsicum spray he 'd bought in town , entrenched in his choking half-snore . <p> After she 'd helped him bandage the wound , not as deep as the blood made it seem , he 'd spent the afternoon facing down an invisible grizzly , releasing the trigger . " Like tear gas , " he 'd remarked with satisfaction when the suffocating red pepper cloud blew back at him . He 'd leave the spray for her ; it 'd come in handy back in New York , he commented , winking . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the pine-darkened panes she could n't see anything , but registered the sharp burst and whine of a shot . More ricocheting gunshots extracted echoes from the volumes between the meadow and Lava Mountain . She remembered the blunderbuss in the Accord ; she 'd asked him to keep it out of the house , refused to touch it , had no idea they still made ammunition for old weapons like that . Outside it was starless ; the bear , if it had ever been there , had vanished , but she could feel its absence in the wind-stirred darkness . <p> She made her way downstairs , palms tracking the wall . When she cracked the sliding door she glimpsed his thickened shadow , highlighted by a white T-shirt , stumbling in circles . Hollow repercussions followed another blast . From the rustling slide of his footsteps , she knew his feet were bare ; then he fell , a diffuse crash , as if his limbs dropped one by one into the pine needles and wet , tangled grass . From the door she called tentatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold out there ... " Her words clinked like nails falling on a mirror of dense , frozen air . Shuddering , less from chill than from fear , she locked both the doors . <p> How much do you know about Claus ? she asked herself , perhaps for the first time , in the eons of that sleepless night . After the first volley , he had stopped firing , no more bullets , she guessed ; but she did hear a metallic rasp under the window , as if he ratcheted open his father 's obscene Nazi firearm , trying to reload . She pressed the hysterical cat to her chest . The answer was not much , or she had forgotten it . A fiancee had dumped him when he was twenty . He 'd had a " fit " of some kind that got him out of the Army . His father- " the tyrant " was how he 'd described him-had finally died , not of syphilis , but colon cancer . Once , in bed , he 'd said with characteristic , buoyant irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stressed out again " : They thought I was having another breakdown , but all I needed was a good old-fashioned American divorce . He never showed her a picture of his wife , or revealed her first name , only muttered with a rueful shrug that she 'd become a Fundamentalist Christian right after the wedding . In a different part of the country , dazed by a concussion , she had focused on his least essential remark instead : When I knew I was going to leave her , I became the best husband I could . <p> She does n't encounter the bear again until " Claus " - if that is his real name-has been gone a week . The morning after the shooting she 'd ventured shakily out to the frost-crusted meadow to find Claus standing up , dead gun at his feet , staring at the brain-shaped mountain with wide-open eyes . She 'd uttered his name tentatively , then saw he was asleep , taking in breath , not letting it out , until it accrued the usual snoring groan . <p> He claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his new bear coat and death camps for non-Aryan squirrels . The day after that he had eased the jam-packed Accord out of the driveway before she woke up , leaving a note between the pages of Bear Attacks , a book he wanted her to return to the library . Scrawled in his furled handwriting on lined yellow paper , it said , I do love you which I have never said because you never said it . But the pages that compressed the message told of a bear that had killed and devoured a woman because it smelled her menstrual blood . He also left the dull crosscut saw , his symbol , she thought , of abandonment . Later she would find out he had never gone to a teaching job in Orange County . <p> The breakthrough poem about these events , her first narrative verse , with a startling , unfamiliar personal voice , will be titled " The Ballad of Two Lovers with Damaged Heads . " At first , however , she does n't write . Remembering or reinventing all she had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous to concentrate . At night the words she believes he said return to her from an invisible hollow , blurred , restless as the new , snow-pregnant wind : I woke up , bleeding , my hand full of glass , wondering why " The Colonel " was beating me , followed by an unconnected scream , maybe her own , and a fragment : I checked into the local loony bin for a little vacation . She distracts herself by making trips to the grocery store , cooking elaborate dishes for herself , like chicken in chipotle sauce , then uncomfortably hot , suddenly queasy , fails to eat them . <p> The night before the bear comes back , she fixed an elaborate brodo , an authentic Northern Italian broth , rich with beef and turkey wings , and simmered it on the stove all night . She plans to make risotto with some , and freeze the rest for soups to heat when the busy fall semester starts . Straining the pungent amber liquid , she sees the animal on the rotting slats , incongruous next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thinks , by the brodo 's scent , borne into the surrounding forest . <p> The bear should be shrouded by sunlight or darkness , seen or envisioned through a veil of trees . In sharp focus outside the door , it is too clear . Its swaying head seems too small for its body ; its paws , joining its thick legs with a bend instead of an ankle , end in impotent curved claws . Its dirt-matted , brownish fur is not as dark as she 'd thought ; it blows through its mouth , but does n't growl or roar . A schizophrenic bum cooling soup , a Mandarin emperor . She tries to create a personification , but poetry is futile , her images false ; she realizes she does n't know an essential fact  --  whether or not the bear is male . Three blue tags , proof of its doomed status , are clamped in its ear . She is startled , angry , ashamed , almost joyful , as she would be if the man from her past materialized with his stoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in her New York apartment , on the cabin floor . She observes herself think , " What I want to do is turn my eyes away , pretend this beast is not really here . " <p> Abased or tame , detached from its presence in the forbidden place , it is the bear that averts its head to gaze abstractly into the Aspens , instead of at her on the other side of the screen . She considers setting down a bowl of broth and inviting the animal in to guzzle a last supper . This is no enraged grizzly , ready to tear her face apart , but it , too , is dangerous . Better to leave it foundering in this morning 's glowing bubble of stasis as she remains safely behind a barrier , watching it carefully , starting over . <p> Then a motor chokes , cuts off . The trailer neighbor in his blue pickup , a shotgun in the rack above the cab 's back window , cranks open the door . He yells the predictable word : Bear ! <p> Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
