AS I SUSPECTED , STEALING FROM PROFESSIONAL thieves takes some skill and a lot of hard work . We took shifts at the oars once we were out of the territory of the Painted People and did n't , as was more usual among peaceful mariners , go ashore to sleep . Shethe shipwas decked only lightly , boards nailed over her ribs and hide bottom . We were drenched by squalls and frozen by the icy spring seas breaking over our bows . But , Lord , she was fast ! Small and light , propelled by ten at the oars by day and six by night . We all took rowing duty , as I said , the ones not pulling at the sweeps eating , then sleeping on the narrow deck between the rowing benches . Or we slept when we could . At times we would row into an icy rain squall . Then the sleepers had to rouse themselves and bail like mad , not to keep her from sinking but so as not to slow those of us plying the oars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slowed , heavy seas might break her up . Whereas , more or less empty of water , she was able to ride the combers like a floating cork , and in calmer waters , skim along as might a bird . We had no sail , since we wished to announce neither our passage nor arrival to any watching coastal people . And watch they do , being as they are used to trouble coming by sea . I do n't like to remember the start of our voyage or our first few days aboard . We were all seasick and none too sure of ourselves at the oars . But Dugald , who is my Druid , gave me medicine for seasickness . True , it tasted like the floor of a town midden pit and stank worse than a herd of goats , but withalit worked . And most of us recovered well enough todevote ourselves to the oars within a day or two . I 'm not sure Dugald considers himself my Druid . Once he was my guardian , then my teacher . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should be my Druid . He could n't agree less . He says I 'm a child and only an honorary ruler , and not to be so presumptuous as to drape a mantle of authority over my shoulders . I wished I had something to drape over my shoulders . Gods above and below , it was cold in that boat . But I knew if I could pull this off , I would be rich and a real queen . So I must make the attempt , no matter how great the hardships involved . Four days out of port , I understood I had good companions . Our flotillathere were three small shipsheld seventeen men each . " Men " not always being actual men ; some were women . But there was a man at the tiller of each boat ; Maeniel , my foster father , on one ; Gray , an oath man of mine on another ; and aboard this one , Ure , a relative of Gray 's , an experienced man of the sea . Ours was the lead ship ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hazards : rocks , reefs , sand spitsthough with our shallow-draft , those were n't a problemcurrents , and , last but not least , pirate nests . He told us he would undertake to keep us clear of them all . In return , we did n't ask him how he knew so much and promised to devote ourselves to the work of the oars . When I asked him if we should n't have some dry land practice first , he fixed me with an eye cold and green as a breaking winter sea and said , " One learns best by doing . And when you do a thing day to day on a regular basis , you will eventually learn all there is to know about it . Sometimes more than you want to know . " He was right ; by now , eight days into our voyage , I knew a lot more about rowing than I ever wanted to . About blisters that broke and bled , scabbed over , then broke open again the next day and bled . About excruciating pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discomfort of perpetually wet clothing that chafed and itched , or sleeping on a hard , wet , stinking plank among the wet , stinking bodies of fellow crew members . Of huddling together with them to try to coax a little warmth from one another . Not to mention the joys of hanging off the stern up to your waist in the icy sea as the small craft you are clinging to battles fifteen-foot waves while you try to take care of necessities , since there is no room aboard for such nonsense as chamber pots . See , the water ran to the back of the craft because she was lighter at the bows , so the steersman bailed with one hand while he clung to the tiller with the other . Guess what he used to do the bailing ? When I was much younger , I used to think the sea was romantic . Despite our many struggles , we moved with almost unbelievable swiftness toward the south and the forts of the Saxon shore . On the tenth day , we arrived at the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of rowing in the heaving , pitching sea . We were all glad to pull the narrow craft into the tall reeds and sedges , rest , and wait for dawn . It came without a sunrise , a gray illumination of ridged storm clouds . I was sleeping , my head on the gunwales , when I awakened to see Maeniel , as wolf , slip over the bow of the boat next to ours and vanish into the water . I had slept hard and drooled ; it dried on the side of my face and left a damp spot on the wood near where my lips rested . There was no color in anything , and the sedges , reeds , and cattails were a dark frieze reflected in the silvered water . Everyone else was asleep except Ure . He was sitting in the bow and his eyes met mine , green as slag glass and twice as hard . I opened my mouth to ask him where Maeniel was going . His hard gaze edged into contempt . I reflected that I knew exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use at all for what he called senseless blather . No sense waking half the boat to ask a question when I knew the answer already . I put my head back down on the gunwale . I did n't think I could , but I drifted off to sleep . When I awakened again , Maeniel was climbing back into the boat . He was dripping wet and wrapping one of Gray 's mantles around himself . I rose ; pulling up my stiffened body was a painful effort . But I stepped to the deck and tiptoed around the sodden sleepers between the rowing benches until I reached the three standing in the bow , Gray , Maeniel , and Ure . " What ? " I whispered . " Nothing good , " Maeniel said . " The smartest thing might be to turn around and go back . " Ure grunted . Gray whispered , " Say on , Lord Maeniel . " " I did n't think their strong point would be this strong . The pirates have refitted an abandoned Roman fortress about ten miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all mature , able-bodied warriors . Twice our force and more . Better armed , tried and tested in battle . " " Ships ? " Ure asked . " I counted twenty careened and upside down on land . A few more in the water , " Maeniel said . " We have what ? " Gray said . " Forty boys , three men , and eight women . " He shook his head . " We should look for easier pickings . " I felt my failure , and , yes , the failure was mine . Though I sat on the Dragon Throne and it was acknowledged I had the right to be there , the subchiefs had n't fallen in with my plans to carry war to the Saxon raiders who harried our highland coasts and Out Islands . When I visited the villages recruiting among the war bands and coast watch , none were willing to chance such a hazardous endeavor as striking at the Saxons in their home ports . Yes , they had hailed me wildly at my accession to the Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had second thoughts . What did a woman , a child , as yet , know of warfare ? I got the useless , the outcast , the weak , the orphaned , the despised among the boys . And as for girls , the ugly . One had a strawberry birthmark that covered one cheek and part of her mouth . Another was taken captive and left for dead by the same Saxon raiders . Another hid her harelip . The others , drudges , broken by hard labor before they were in their teens , without friends or kin , bearing the load of endless work by day and the weight of their owners ' bodies by night . Leading lives so filled with misery that they had come to believe any chance of freedom was better than their day-to-day existence . If they should fail and fall into death , why then . . . so be it . Nothing beyond death could be worse . " At least I can sleep , " one called Albe told me . " At least we could burn their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , there are some in the water , " Maeniel told me . " We would probably be run down in the open sea . The pirate craft are oared and also light and very fast . Not to mention much better manned . " " Suicide ! " Ure said . " Over the wall by night and take them in their beds ? " I suggested . " Full of ideas ! " Ure commented . " No ! These are children , not blooded . I 'm a corrupt old devil , but even I wo n't be a party to the slaughter of innocents . For such tricks you need a group of experienced men . " Any others ? " he asked . I hunkered down and looked up at the three men . " Yes , " I said . Ure made a beckoning gesture . " Say ! " he said . " What 's inside that fortress ? Is it stone or wood ? " I asked . " Wood , " Maeniel said . " But on that scale . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said between my teeth . " I can . " Then I reached over the side and fished out a floating branch , narrow , maybe a foot long . Very waterlogged . I clamped my right hand around it . With a whistling hiss , steam erupted around it , erupted the way steam does when water is poured into a hot metal pot . Then from the top to the bottom , the dry stick burst into flame and was ash before it had time to heat my fingers . " I 'll go over the wall while you and the rest strike at the gates and burn them out . " Maeniel studied me . " The reason the Romans abandoned the fortress was the damp began to undermine the walls . Like as not , what 's in the fortress that is n't wet is at least damp . " " There 's that , " Ure said . I rose from my heels and stood looking the three of them in the face . " Bet your life , bet your patrimony , bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something , it will burn . " I raised my scarred right hand and held it up before them . " Yes , " Ure said , looking at Gray . " It 's a plum , this place , and well worth the risk . " Gray looked uncertain . Maeniel studied me sadly . " Very well , " he said at length . " Nothing is sure , ever , " Ure said to Gray . " Nothing . " When I turned , I saw the youngsters in the boats were awake , sitting up and staring at the four of us . Outcasts , I thought . Maybe this is the advantage of being in the company of the last and least . None of them looked afraid and most seemed ready for anything . The Brotherhood of the Bagudae . Black Leg was already lonely . He moved away from the forest near Tintigal , where he 'd left them . He missed his family , blood family or not . Even that terrible-tempered old Dugald , though these days all he did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was progressing into a real noblewoman . But , of course , he missed her most of all . He wished sometimes they were still children . When they were young , before the pirates came , the two of them used to snuggle together against Mother 's warm belly . He would turn human just so she could cradle him in her arms . Most times he had no use for the shape , except when climbing around in the rocks to get birds ' eggs or going up trees after fruit . And from time to time attempting to understand some of Dugald 's stranger ideas . Like those choirs of angels . He had put up a fight when Dugald tried to get him to memorize them , thrones , denominations , principalities , powers , and so on . He 'd told Dugald in no uncertain terms that he had no interest in the classification of impossible , nonexistent beings . Dugald told him a lot of people would believe he , Black Leg , was a nonexistent being . Black Leg replied that he was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dugald could produce an angel , he , Black Leg , would learn how to place it in proper ranking order with no further complaint . " She , " the fair one , thought it was hilarious . Magetsky , up in the raft- ers , waxed loud , filling the room with raucous laughter . Dugald lost his temper . Magetsky , the raven , abruptly left , pursued by a small , dark thunderbolt . Kyra discovered she wanted to visit Etta , Gray 's wife . Maeniel went hunting , and he , Black Leg , and Guinevere went and slept in the woods . That was the last time , though . Not long after , Kyra separated them , saying it was n't seemly any longer for them to share a bed . People might talk . " About what ? " he asked indignantly . No one offered a straight answer , not even his father , Maeniel . He did n't think about it much after that , because then Mother died . Somehow he had known in his heart that a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyre was ashes and she was gone , he told his father that he wanted to learn to be a man . Maeniel had given him a long , thoughtful look . A speaking one . But wolves do not lightly try to interfere with one another 's freedom or give advice , even when requested to do so . But he did say one thing . " Do n't get involved in their struggles . They are endless and usually futile . Wolves settled things between themselves before the beginning of time , but these creatures have never come to an accommodation with God 's creation or with each other . Still , I suppose you must let them break your heart once . Then perhaps you will learn . " He had wondered at the time what his father meant . Now he was sure he knew . He remembered her with great bitterness and more than a little sorrow . The lands he moved through were rugged , wild , and unsettled . He remained wolf as he traveled . There were two or three packs about ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasional big cat still ruled the heights . But Mother taught him to be an efficient , able wolf long before he ever thought about turning to his human side . So he had no problem avoiding them . It was spring and there were females in heat that drew him , but he was n't ready , not really mature enough to fight for the father right . In any of the packs , poaching on the territories of the leaders would sooner or later lead to an attack , possibly by the whole pack . Wolf law said you presented yourself openly , took your place in the hierarchy , then challenged the leader . The treacherous interloper would meet the bared fangs of the leader and his inner circle , all yearning to shed his blood . Farmsteads were scattered on fertile patches of soil throughout the forest , but they were , without exception , surrounded by high , earthen banks surmounted by palisade fences . The resident war dogs that protected the livestock were nothing a lone wolf wanted to mess around with . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , just before first light , he came to a valley with a lake . He should have known . From the first moment , it raised the hackles on the back of his neck . A wolf would have left . But with him , there was that human component . So he trotted downhill into the fog that filled the bowl of the valley . No humans . That in itself should have made him suspicious . But he was far too inexperienced to have his anxieties roused by the absence of something . Light was spreading from the east into the silent forest at the lake 's margin , illuminating the haze that hung between the trees with long shafts that were almost as discrete from each other as a handful of sticks . Nothing . No wolves , no humans , and in a place as beautiful as morning in paradise . He could n't believe his good fortune . Indeed , he should n't have . He sensed the water was very close . Then he smelled it and found he was trotting along through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw a stretch of open water and a dim shape that might have been an island . The light striking down from above was losing its grayness and turning slowly to gold , trees to green , and the water to a multicolored gem as it cast back the reflection of the surrounding forest . He bent his head and drank , troubling the absolutely smooth surface with his tongue . When he raised his head , he found the fatigue of the long night 's trip weighed heavy on him . He was not used to traveling so far so fast as a wolf . And then he reflected that , while lonely , he was at least now free of the thousand constraints that had beset him as a human being . He could return to the forest , seek a warm nest in bracken and dried leaves , and enjoy the luxury of sleeping as long as he liked . He stretched as languorously as a cat , stiffening each of his hind legs in turn , yawned , and just about then . . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck . . . and every hair on his body stood straight up at the sound of a triumphant crow of savage , evil laughter .
