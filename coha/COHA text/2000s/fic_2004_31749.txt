Chapter One The devil had dealt from the bottom of the deck one time too many . An eye for an eye , the Bible said . Or at least Cole Knight had heard somewhere the good book said something like that . To tell the truth , he was n't much of a Biblical scholar . But he loved God , he loved the hot , thorny land under his boots that by all rights should have been his , and he loved his family - in that order . He was willing to die for them , too . Maybe that was overstating the case . In fact , Cole Knight was n't much of anything . Was n't likely to be , either . Not if Caesar Kemble and his bunch had their way . But where was it written you could n't kill a man on the same day you buried your good for nothin ' father and set things right ? Especially if that man was the cause of your old man 's ruin ? And yours , too ? Hell , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Knights had as much right - more right - as the Kembles to be here . Cole Knight belonged here . Trouble was , he did n't own a single acre . The Kembles had stripped him to the bone . The feud between the Kembles and the Knights went back for more than a hundred and forty years . It had all begun when the first Caesar Kemble , the original founder of the Golden Spurs Ranch , had died without a will , and his son Johnny Kemble had cheated his adopted sister , Carolina Knight , out of most of her share . The Knights were direct descendants of Carolina Knight , whose biological father , Horatio Knight , had been a partner of the original Caesar Kemble . When Horatio and his wife had been killed in an Indian raid , Caesar had adopted their orphaned daughter . As if being cheated had n't been bad enough , four more generations of Kembles had continued to cheat and collude and steal even more land from the Knights . Not that the Knights were saints . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than the Kembles ' , had shrunk to a miserable fifty thousand acres . Then worst of all , not long ago , Cole 's father had lost those last fifty thousand acres in a card game . Thus , Black Oaks had faded into oblivion while the Golden Spurs had become an international agribusiness corporation with interests in the Thoroughbred horse industry , the oil and gas industry , cattle ranching , recreational game hunting and farming . The Golden Spurs developed cattle breeds , improved horse breeds and participated in vital environmental research . The Kembles owned hundreds of thousands of acres and mineral rights to vast oil and gas reserves and were Texas royalty , while the Knights were dirt . Cole had already been to the barn to saddle Dr. Pepper . No sooner had Sally McCallie , the last hypocritical mourner , waddled out of the dilapidated ranch house than Cole was out of his sticky , black wool suit and into his jeans and boots . A few seconds later his long , lean body was stomping down the back stairs into the sweltering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging shut behind him . There was finality in that summertime sound . Thrusting his rifle into his worn scabbard , he seized the reins and threw himself onto Dr. Pepper . His daddy was dead , his bloated face as gray and nasty under the waxy makeup as wet ash , and Cole 's own unhappy boyhood was over . It was just as well . Not that he had much to show for it . He 'd had to quit college after his older brother , Shanghai , who 'd been putting him through school , had unearthed some incriminating original bank documents and journals , which proved Carolina had been swindled . When Shanghai had threatened to sue the Kembles , Caesar had run him off or so people had thought . His disappearance was something of a mystery . Shanghai had left in the middle of the night without even saying goodbye . Without Shanghai 's help and with an ailing father to support , Cole had n't had money to pay tuition much less the time to spend on school . Twenty-four and broke , Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least that 's what the locals thought . Like a lot of young men , he seethed with ambition and the desire to set things right . He wanted the ranch back , not just the fifty thousand acres , but the rest of it , and there was nothing he would n't do to get it . Too bad he took after his old man , local folk said . Too bad his brother Shanghai , who 'd shown such promise as a rancher , had turned out to be as sorry as the rest of the Knights when he 'd abandoned his dying father . Cole felt almost good riding toward the immense Golden Spurs Ranch . Finally he was doing something about the crimes of the past and present that had made his soul fester . Partly he felt better because he could n't get on a horse without relaxing a little . Cowboying had been born in him . It was as natural to him as breathing , eating and chasing pretty girls . For the past three years , Cole had wanted one thing - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of what was left of their ranch and for running his brother off . Those acres were n't just land to Cole . They 'd been part of him . He 'd dreamed of ranching them with his brother someday . Not that his daddy had given much of a damn that the last of the land that had once been part of their legendary ranch had been lost . " Leave it be , boy , " his daddy had said after Cole had found out the ranch was gone . " It was my ranch , not yours . Maybe Caesar and me was both drunk as a pair of coons in a horse trough filled with whiskey , but Kemble won Black Oaks fair and square with that royal flush . " " The hell he did , Daddy . The hell he did . You were drunk because he got you drunk . Caesar Kemble knew exactly what he was doing . What kind of fool plays poker drunk ? " " I 'm not like you , boy . I play poker for fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole . " Black Oaks was n't just yours . You did n't have the right to gamble it away . It was mine and Shanghai 's . " " Well , it 's gone just the same , boy . You ca n't rewrite history . You 're a loser , born to a loser , brother of a loser . History is always written by the winners . " " I swear - if it 's the last thing I ever do , I 'll get Black Oaks back - all of it . " " You 'll get yourself killed if you mess with Caesar Kemble . That 's what you 'll do . My father was a hothead like you and he went over to have it out with the Kembles and vanished into thin air . Do n't get yourself murdered , boy , or run off , like Shanghai did . " " As if you care - " His easygoing daddy had n't cared much about anything other than partying and getting drunk . With his Stetson low over his dark brow and longish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy pastures choked by huisache , ebony and mesquite . Dr. Pepper trotted for at least a mile before Cole 's heart quickened when he saw the billowing dust from the herd rising above a stand of low trees like yellow smoke to dirty the sky . The vaqueros and Kemble 's sons , who worked for the Golden Spurs , had been gathering the herd for several days in the dense thickets that had once belonged to the Knights . Rich as he was , Caesar , who like Cole , loved cowboying more than he loved anything - including cheating at cards - would be out there with his men and sons . Cole hoped to catch him alone in some deep and thorny thicket and have it out with him once and for all . Yes , sirree , that 's just what he hoped until he saw Lizzy Kemble through the dense brush . Somehow the sight of the slim , uncertain girl on the tall black gelding struggling to keep up with the vaqueros and her younger , more able brothers , cousins and sister stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
