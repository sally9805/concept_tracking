Wall Street analysts have a credibility problem . No question . But this silliness about tech analysts ' causing the stock market to inflate and then burst has got to stop . It 's way too convenient . The lesson here is n't that the analysts are shills . It 's that greed and speculation come disguised , and if you do n't accept your own failure to unmask those wealth raiders , you 're bound to fall victim next time around too . <P> In the post-bubble witch hunt , two Internet analysts are getting most of the blame  --  Henry Blodget at Merrill Lynch and Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . They 're natural targets . Both work at influential brokerage firms . Both reportedly made $15 million , give or take , as Internet stocks soared in 1999 . And both now concede the obvious : they were too slow to downgrade dozens of stocks . Their bullishness in the face of impending disaster has riveted attention on the analyst 's role across Wall Street . It 's not a pretty picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a company when its rating is going down . The company can then ask for a change in the accompanying research note . And the analyst must give a reason for declining to do so . That sorry procedure came to light last week . It casts analysts as puppets of the companies they follow . Meanwhile , brokerages routinely pay them to land underwriting deals , a sale most easily closed with a glowing research report in hand . <P> So glaring are such conflicts of interest that Byron Wien , stock-market strategist at Morgan Stanley , took the system to task in his research report : " It is clear that the profession has some serious work to do to rebuild confidence , " he wrote , urging analysts to be " intellectually honest and independent . " My favorite criticism comes from the stock jocks on CNBC  --  the very same folks who made stars of bulls like Blodget and Meeker by putting them on the air day after day while the bubble was still bloating . These watchdogs now insist that analysts answer for their miscalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk answer for airing this stuff ad nauseam and without balance ? The print world is n't blameless either . Nobody wanted to hear that Net stocks were incendiary . Audiences would have tuned out . <P> But can you really blame analysts for what happened with VA Linux Systems ? The software company filed to go public at $12 a share in 1999 . Before any analyst had a chance to publish a word , demand enabled underwriter Credit Suisse First Boston to raise the IPO to $30 . Maybe it should have stuck to the initial price , which in theory anyway was based on some valuation model . But it scarcely mattered . <P> Investors wanted the stock so badly they bid it up to $239 in a day . Bullish analyst reports came in weeks later , and guess what ? The stock fell steadily . It 's now under $4 . That pattern was not unusual . It suggests that the only thing investors were paying attention to was their dreams . And that 's the best disguise of all , really . You tell yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the lottery . But of course we ca n't all hit the lottery together . In the end a dream is exactly that , whether there 's an analyst in it or not . <P> See
