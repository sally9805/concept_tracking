Jinx High A Diana Tregarde Investigation By Lackey , Mercedes Tor Books Lackey , Mercedes Buffie Gentry pounded the steering wheel of her brand-new Miata , and cursed -- though what she really felt like doing was crying her eyes out like a little kid . It could n't have stalled . Daddy had just picked it up today . There was nothing wrong with anything , it had a full tank of gas -- But it had died way out here on 101st , and now it was n't responding at all . And this was a spooky place to get stranded past midnight . You might as well be in West Texas instead of less than twenty miles from downtown Tulsa . There was n't anything out here but cows and cicadas , mysterious shadows , and an awful lot of dark . Visions of the Rainy-day Rapist and the Southside Strangler kept popping into her head , making her look over her shoulder as she tried to get the damn car started one more time . No luck . And now the tears did come ; she sobbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . God , this is like the classic slasher-movie setup , girl stuck out on a deserted road at three a.m.  - -  next thing I 'll see is a guy in a hockey mask -- She shivered and told herself not to be stupid . There was a gas station not a half mile behind her -- it was closed , but there was a phone there . She could call the auto club . That was why Daddy had agold card with them . Resolutely -- though it took every bit of courage she had -- she left the protection of the car and started the long trudge back toward the Kerr/McGee station . But she kept seeing things out of the corner of her eye , things that vanished when she looked straight at them , and before long she was n't walking , she was running . She 'd never been so grateful to see a gas station in her life . She fumbled the last quarter out of her purse -- this was one of those phones where you could n't use a charge card , and you had to put a quarter into it even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumped all her change , back at the mall , when Fay Harper had sneered at her for putting cash in the liver-transplant box . Fay had made her so damn mad -- just because she 'd beaten the senior out on the Teenage America finals , that was no reason for Fay to imply she 'd gotten that far by sleeping with one of the judges -- Well , neither of them made it to the regionals , so there . Buffie just wished Fay had n't said what she did , when Buffie had retorted with the truth nobody ever said out loud . " You should know , Fay Harper . You get everything you want by sleeping around and passing out nose candy . " And Fay had said something horrible , whispered it in Buffie 's ear . So horrible Buffie could n't remember exactly what it was -- just some kind of threat . Or promise . Because it had ended with --  " And when you see what 's coming for you , remember I sent it . " Buffie shoved her coin into the slot with hands that shook so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quick answer . " God damn it . " Sharon LeeMar looked at the phone resentfully . It would ring , now , when she 'd just gotten a new coat of polish on her nails . It was probably nothing ; some drunk , like last night , wanting the auto club to pull the car out of the ditch where he 'd put it . Or some stupid kid who 'd missed her ride home from some rich-bitch party , and wanted them to provide her with one . Well , there was a way around that . It was n't like she had n't done it before . She hit the button with her elbow . " Big A Auto Club , " she said . " Will you hold ? " And before the caller could say a word , she hit the hang-up button . Buffie stared at the phone in gut-wrenching shock , unable to believe she was hearing a dial tone . " No --  " she whispered , a panic that she knew was irrational starting to take over . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping for one more quarter . Nothing . With a sob , she upended the whole thing on the pavement , pawing through a tangled mess of makeup , jewelry , credit cards , and odd bits of paper , praying for a quarter , a dime , anything -- Then she heard the sound ; a kind of growl . And looked up . And the scream died in her throat before she could utter it . " What ? " Derek Kestrel half closed his lids against the wind that was drying his eyes , and gathered breath for another bellow . " I said , " Deke yelled , trying to make himself audible over the bellow of the TransAm 's engine and the painfully howling guitars of Motley Cre , " I ca n't hear you ! " Fay Harper shook her head , her blond shag whipping wildly about her cheekbones . Her hair looked like spun frost under the fluorescent streetlamps , her pale skin glowed in the moonlight , and her eyes were turned to crimson embers by the reflections from the panel lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , turning the volume up another notch until the TransAm 's floor panels shook from the bass . Deke sighed and gave up , leaning back into the padded headrest of his seat . It was custom-leather upholstered , of course , in deep burgundy to match the rest of the car ; Fay Harper was never seen in less than the very best . Nothing was going to compete with those speakers . Nothing natural , anyway . A B-52 at full throttle , maybe . Hanging out with Fay was hazardous to the eardrums . He wished now he 'd brought earplugs or something . First had been the concert , front-row seats , now it was Fay 's ass-kicking stereo ; he was going to be deaf before the night was over . Then again , hanging out with Fay Harper was hazardous to a lot more than the eardrums . The TransAm tore down Memorial , Fay daring anything to pull into her path . Deke squinted against the headlights of the oncoming cars , assessed his blood-alcohol level by how fuzzy they looked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . It was a good thing his dad could n't see him now . Hell , it was a good thing his dad had n't seen the concert ! While Deke had n't shared anything but the bottle Fay 'd brought , grass had been the mildest of the recreational pharmaceuticals making the rounds tonight . Funny . Dad may have been a wild-eyed hippie back when he was Deke 's age , but he did n't know the half of what went on these days . Deke said the word " concert , " and he could almost see nostalgic visions of Woodstock drifting through his dad 's mind in a sunshine-golden , artistically backlit haze . The Summer of Love . Peace , pop . Like , it 's a happening . Oh , wow . He laughed out loud , and Fay gave him a funny look , then cranked the stereo up the last notch . His whole body throbbed and vibrated with the song . He could feel the amplifier overheating -- Or maybe the heat he felt was the effect of her hand sliding up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and Sandy Foster , football bohunk extraordinaire , leaned forward and handed them both cold beers , after throwing his own empty through the open T-top . " Kick ass , Fay ! " he shouted , as Fay gave him a smile that dazzled in the hellfire glow from the instrument panel , and a long , wet kiss in exchange for the beer . She never once took her foot off the gas , but she never swerved , and she had n't missed a light yet . There was a flash of headlights in the left lane as a couple of hopped-up metal-heads in a chop-top Cougar pulled alongside . The driver shouted something , lost in the howl of engines and the screech of feedback . Fay tossed back her head in laughter , rapped on the horn once , contemptuously . Then she gave them the finger , and blew the doors off their pitiful poser-custom . Deke wondered if his spine was going to have a close encounter with the back seat . The speedometer was in three digits by the time his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howled again , and another bottle hit the pavement behind them . Deke looked back at the Cougar eating their dust . For a minute , the guy on the passenger 's side looked a little like his buddy Alan . He bit his lip , and wondered what Alan was doing tonight -- then looked at the bottle in his hand . His conscience awoke , and sanity reared its cold , ugly head . What in the hell am I doing here ? How did I ever get mixed up with Fay 's crowd ? Sandy was screaming along with the Cre ; the simpleminded lyrics of any popular song were all he needed to cover his questions . Yeah , but Sandy 's got three answers to deal with everything he runs up against -- drink it , screw it , or tackle it . Every Bud 's for him . Jillian McIver , Fay 's best friend , was nuzzling Sandy 's neck like a toothless vampire . The rest of them pretty much match Sandy . Jill 's got no life outside the mall . Fay 's got anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do they want with me ? He glanced over at Fay ; she smiled and licked her lips , and her hand reached the Promised Land . Questions began to seem pretty immaterial . . . . However , Fay 's luck with the lights ran out at just that moment . She pulled her hand away as the light changed from yellow to red . She might have tried to run it -- but there was a little something bearing down on the intersection . Deke was n't so gone that he could n't see the semi -- and his reactions were n't too blown to grab for the " aw-shit " bar on the door as Fay cursed , locked all four wheels , and put the TransAm into a sideways drift , stopping just short of the intersection . And as the front swung around , the headlights glared right into the eyes of the metal-brains still trying to race them . They did n't see the semi , or the red light -- and if their music was as loud as Fay 's , they could n't hear the air horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free-fire zone . The Cougar dragged against the side of the semi 's cab in a slo-mo shower of glass and plastic , fiberglass pelting down like candy-apple-red hail -- the impact inaudible over the hellish guitar . Fay was n't fazed in the least . She bared her teeth , mouthed something , and down-shifted ; gunned the car , and fled the scene in a cloud of tire smoke . Smiling . Jill and Sandy were in a heap somewhere on the floorboard , mingling with what was left of the cold case Fay had brought to finish off the concert . All that Deke could think of for the first , shell-shocked minutes , was -- Sandy 's probably enjoying the hell out of himself . Deke pried his fingers off the bar , one at a time . Fay 's hands were on the wheel and the shifter , giving him a moment of thought unclouded by raging hormones . He looked back at the wreck , and in a break between songs yelled , " What about them ? Are n't you gonna --  " " They were n't fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They got what they were asking for . They were n't good enough , and they were n't fast enough . " She gave him a long , sideways look , measuring him against some unknown standard . Her eyes narrowed , and she licked her lips , the barest hint of her tongue showing between them . " So how about it , Deke ? Are you fast enough ? " Shit . He looked back at the wreck ; Fay shoved the stick up into fifth and slid her hand over to his leg . Again . Christ . She 's crazy ! I think that wreck made her horny ! Or -- hornier --  Deke suppressed a wince . " Fay ! " Jillian McIver had a voice like a ripsaw , but the harsh whine was music to Deke 's ears about now . Fay pulled her hand away . " What ? " she snarled over her shoulder . " What the hell were you doing ? " Jill 's disheveled head rose over the seat back , her dark curls falling over one eye ; her lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked at it petulantly . Deke watched as Sandy 's hand came up and made a grab for her , and she elbowed him away . " I about broke my neck , Fay , " she complained , raking her hair out of her eyes with talonlike fingernails . " An ' I cut my lip . It 's gon na be a mess for a week . What d' you think you 're doing , anyway ? " My God . The guys in that Cougar could be dead , and all she 's worried about is her lip ! " Livin ' life in the fast lane , girl , " Fay replied with poisonous sweetness . " ' Smatter ? Ca n't you take the pace ? " " But my lip --  " " Sandy 'll kiss it , and make it all better , " Fay cooed . " Wo n't you , honey ? " " You bet , " Sandy said thickly , from somewhere below the level of the seat back , and Jill vanished in the direction of his voice with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become part of the upholstery . Yeah . Life in the fast lane . And me a Yugo . Neep , neep . Oh well ; the wreck was n't that bad . At least those guys walked away from it . Fay had just hit a bad stretch of road on the winding back way into Jenks , and she needed to keep one hand on the shifter , one on the wheel , and both eyes in front of her . Fay was a foot-to-the-wall driver , but she was n't suicidal . Even this late at night , you never knew when some drunk cowboy was going to pull out in front of you from one of the kicker bars around here . Trees and bushes blurred past , sparked with the occasional flickers of fire that were animal eyes staring , mesmerized by their speeding headlights . Deke blinked . So Fay caused a bumper-bender . Big deal . As he watched the shadows blur past , the memory slowly faded from his mind . All he was thinking about was the speed , the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . . . . Aw , hell . Forget it . It 's a damn good thing I 'm not the one driving , he thought muzzily . This road 's right out of Grapes of Wrath . God only knows why Fay 's using it . Your county taxes at work . What was it Alan said ? The difference between Chicago and Tulsa County is that Chicago politicians steal the money after the roadwork 's paid for ? Yeah . Then Dad laughed and said that was why we live in Jenks . Good ol ' Jenks , Oklahoma . All the benefits of Tulsa , none of the drawbacks . Twenty years ago , Jenks had been Hicksville , and Tulsa would n't give the residents of Jenks the time of day -- now it was the bedroom community that Tulsa would love to incorporate , and Jenks was n't having any part of the idea . Now Jenks was the haven for some of the area 's wealthiest professionals -- doctors , lawyers , top management -- who did n't want to give up their well-maintained roads or their autonomously funded school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of that money , the Jenks schools were as good as the private academies over in Tulsa , and a far cry from the Tulsa public school system . That was a big selling point ; yuppie parents believed in expensive education . From computers in the classroom to Olympic pools , what Jenks High did n't have was n't worth having . And a mere fifteen minutes up the interstate from your job . Shit , I sound like a real-estate ad . A yuppie paradise . Every acquisitive dream come true , and no slums to mar the landscaping ; no low-income housing , no porno rows , no bag ladies , no " undesirables . " It harbored those who lived a sheltered , pampered life . The kids who went to Jenks were used to living their parents ' fine lifestyle to the hilt , used to the goodies that came without asking . Like Fay , Sandy , Jill . More money than they knew what to do with , and parents too busy clawing their way to the top to pay too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd had expert nannies as babies -- the finest shrinks money could buy to get them through their early teens -- and once they reached sixteen or seventeen , most Jenks parents figured their kids could take care of themselves . Sort of the ultimate latchkey children . So long as they did n't bring the law down on them , so long as they kept their grades up and looked like they were straight , everything was cool .
