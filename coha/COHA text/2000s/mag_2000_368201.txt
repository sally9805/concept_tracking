Is Ian Thorpe the most technically proficient swimmer of all time ? Probably not . Is he the most physically powerful freestyler there has ever been ? No again . Surprisingly , he is unimpressive in the gym and hopeless at ball sports . But at 6 ft. 4 in. and 200 lbs. , with natural buoyancy and a basketballer 's feet and hands , he can move water like the moon . His cartoon elasticity , combined with the longest stroke in swimming , makes " Thorpedo " everything his nickname suggests : sleek , smooth , strangely beautiful and , to the competition , lethal . " If you were going to do a Frankenstein , " says Brian Sutton , coach of nine Australian Olympians , " if you were going to put a swimmer together from scratch , you 'd build Ian Thorpe . " <P> He is just 17 years old and has swum the 200 m and 400 m faster than anyone else in history . He fascinates rivals , coaches , sports scientists and fans . In two years , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track star Cathy Freeman . While the Aboriginal Freeman is the host nation 's only big hope in the main arena , Thorpe spearheads its mightiest swim team in decades . In an island nation , you would expect water sports to be important . They are . Of all the Olympic events , the home fans are savoring a duel in the pool with the Yanks , who do n't seem to have an answer for the teenage talisman . <P> Skillfully managed , gracious and well spoken , Thorpe has been embraced by a public disturbed by the antics of sportsmen such as local tennis brat Lleyton Hewitt . Thorpe 's impact on Australian youth has been compared with the Tiger Woods phenomenon in golf . " He 's become a similar figure of hope , an ultimate role model , " argues 1988 Olympic 200-m champion Duncan Armstrong . Thorpe has been a cover boy on magazines ranging from the frivolous to the prestigious , and many Australians feel they know a lot about him  --  from his shoe size ( 17 ) to his taste in music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Britney Spears , Aussie pop star Kylie Minogue ) . <P> Coaches like Sutton see thousands of hopefuls , and there 's always a weakness : aerobic or strength limitations , lack of competitiveness , laziness , fragility . Something . But in Thorpe , Sutton ca n't find one , and neither can many others . " He marries grace with power , " says Armstrong . " He caresses the water , but when it 's time to be brutal , he 's like a raging bull . " <P> For two years , just for fun , Armstrong has hatched " plan after plan to beat this bloke in my head . And every time I 've come up with a theory , someone has gone out and done what I imagined  --  got on him early , or pounded him in the turns or stuck to him like glue to see if he 'd crack . " Thorpe has had an answer for every challenge . <P> It 's premature to group Thorpe with superstars like Mark Spitz and Alexander Popov as an all-time great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to , and dominates as he has in lesser meets since 1998 , he will belong in that company . He has already staked a claim : the swimming community thought it had seen a race for the ages when Australian Kieren Perkins recorded 3:43.80 in the 400 m at the 1994 world championships in Rome . The field trailed 10 m behind , an eternity . But Thorpe has since lowered that mark three times , most recently to 3:41.33 . By comparison , Klete Keller , America 's best 400-m man , and no polliwog , swam 3:47.18 last month  --  a new U.S. record . He would lose to Thorpe by 11 m.
