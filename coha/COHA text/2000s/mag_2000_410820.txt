Celestial events are always significant-or are they ? // When celestial conjunctions occur , they often belong to the close-but-no-cigar school of sky watching . Technically , a conjunction describes a precise alignment of heavenly bodies that happen to have the same celestial longitude-that is , they appear to line up in the sky , one directly above the other . On occasion , the bodies line up one in front of the other , a circumstance that historically has lent itself to all manner of scientific investigations . But on an informal basis , the word " conjunction " generically refers to the fleeting convergence of celestial objects , a happenstance that 's aesthetically pleasing-and astronomically significant for that reason alone . When a serendipitous close gathering of celestial objects is assigned greater significance , the reason is likely to be astrological . At one time , astronomy and astrology were virtually indistinguishable . Astronomers of old might study the sky to help plan the harvest or coordinate a calendar , but they earned their keep primarily by prophesying favorable heavenly portents for the rulers who employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of the mysterious wanderers-the Sun , Moon , and planets-against the seemingly immovable backdrop of stars . But in the broad sense , conjunctions mark mere cosmic coincidences , and even then , only from the point of view of an observer on Earth . Once our planet lost its position of privilege as the center of the cosmos , that point of view lost its relevance , except where it might prove useful for science . Studies of the motions of Venus as it neared inferior and superior conjunctionspassing on our side and on the far side of the Sunhelped validate the heliocentric model of the cosmos ( see " Venusian Testimony " Natural History , 6/99 ) . Observations of Mercury and Venus transiting the Sun-passing directly in front of it , from the point of view of an observer on Earth-helped determine the scale of the solar system ( see " Mercury in Transit , " Natural History , 11/99 ) . And in 1919 , a total solar eclipse ( an extreme example , being a conjunction that 's also an occultation ) helped validate Einstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old conjunctions in the broadest sense ? For academic purposes , virtually their only astronomical significance is measured in terms of insights they might offer into ancient astrology . ( For a riveting example of how conjunction scholarship can open a window on ancient cultures , see Michael R. Molnar 's 1999 book The Star of Bethlehem : The Legacy of the Magi . ) Photograph On the night of April 11 , Saturn , Mars , and Jupiter form a tight triangle . // This is not to say that people do n't still confuse astronomy and astrology ( or that , heaven knows , astrology is n't still popular ) . In fact , I can personally attest to having been asked many times about my writing on " astrology . " And a subscription mailing referring to this magazine 's coverage of " astrology " was sent out fox years before an alert reader finally noticed it . ( A similar fate sometimes befalls cosmology . A recent press release for a book by physicist Lawrence M. Krauss highlighted his research into dark matter as " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem " now connected with two of the hottest areas in recent cosmetology . " In this case , however , cosmology and cosmetology do n't bear any historical relation to each other , except that both vocations can get a little hairy . ) Even when popular interest in a planetary conjunction is n't purely astrological , it can still be the result of mere superstition . This year , a gathering of planets on May 5 has generated a great deal of apocalyptic speculation on the Internet , specifically about whether the combined gravitational pull of Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn on the far side of the Sun will be enough to knock Earth off its axis . ( It wo n't . ) To viewers on Earth , alas , that particular spectacular alignment will be lost in the glare of the Sun . This month , however , offers a rare and equally notable conjunction that will be fully visible . On April 11 , just after sunset , Saturn , Mars , and Jupiter will form an equilateral triangle within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your fist at arm 's length . Jupiter will be the brightest of the trio and Mars the dimmest , although easily identifiable by its reddish hue . Should the sky be cloudy on April 11 , do n't despair ; over the following five nights , the three planets will still appear unusually close together-closer than at any time since 1921 . In addition , they 'll be joined by a crescent Moon for a few nights starting April 6 . The only possible meaning offered by such a conjunction would be astrological . Nonetheless , this aesthetically auspicious occasion , like all celestial events , will indeed be an important one for professional astronomers . And you 'll even be able to observe it just as they will . Simply follow these directions : go outside and look up . THE SKY IN APRIL Mercury and Venus are all but invisible this month because of their close proximity to the Sun . Both planets are deeply immersed in the bright morning twilight and rise less than an hour before the Sun . A very slender crescent Moon passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3 but will probably be of little help in guiding you to them . These two planets pass within half a degree of each other on April 28 . This would make for a splendid sight were it not for the fact that on this date , they are too close to the Sun to be visible . Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn put on a spectacular show during the first half of April , when they are readily seen in the western sky for at least a couple of hours after sunset . During the first week of the month , we 'll see a rather dim Mars ( magnitude 1.4 ) and a brilliant Jupiter ( magnitude -2 ) crowding close together in the fading evening twilight , with Saturn ( magnitude 0.3 ) sitting just above them . ( On the evening of April 6 , the crescent Moon joins this planetary trio , sitting below and just to the left of Saturn . ) During the second week of April , the configuration of the three planets changes noticeably from night to night . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the evening of April 14 they are the closest they 'll be to one another for quite a while , fitting into an imaginary circle of just under 55 in diameter . Not until May 2002 will we easily be able to see three planets so close together again . After Mars passes Saturn on April 16 , it quickly leaves both Jupiter and Saturn behind to be swallowed up by the bright evening twilight . The MOOn is at new phase on April 4 at 2:12 PM . It reaches first quarter on April 11 at 9:30 A.M. Full Moon is on April 18 at 1:41 Ptn. , and last quarter is on April 26 at 3:30 P.M. Daytight saving time begins on April 2 , the first Sunday of the month . Do n't forget to set your clocks forward one hour before turning in for the night . Remember , the mnemonic is " Spring forward , fall back . " ( A note of caution : Hawaii , Arizona , most of Indiana , Puerto Rico , and the Virgin Islands remain on standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. and 3:00 A.M. on April 2 . Unfortunately , you 'll lose an hour of sleep ( it 's " hour " loss ! ) . Unless othervise noted , all times are given in Eastern Daylight Time .
