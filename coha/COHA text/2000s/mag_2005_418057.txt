The Male Biological Clock Photograph // IT has always been a woman 's issue , one that has guided everything from career moves to marriage . Indeed , the female biological clock-a countdown to the dreaded moment when a woman 's ovaries stop producing eggs and infertility sets in-has been the source of much discussion and angst , especially in today 's society when women are waiting longer and longer to bear children . But is fertility solely a women 's issue ? It 's been said that it takes two to tango . So what role do males play in the fertility crisis that confronts some 6 million couples each year ? Traditionally , men have n't been tested , or not tested thoroughly , for potential fertility problems . All medical attention was on the female as the male partner was sometimes considered a mere bystander who chilled out in the waiting room while his partner was poked and prodded to uncover a problem that was assumed ( by mostly male doctors and experts ) to be hers . " Unfortunately , the conventional wisdom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the nation 's leading urologists and author of The Male Biological Clock . " Men have biological clocks too . " Viewing male sexual health in terms of a biological clock is a new way of approaching the issue . Indeed , there is increasing research that debunks the traditional thought that men can father children as easily at 75 as at 25 . In fact , in about 40 percent of fertility cases-as defined by the inability of a couple to conceive after at least one year of unprotected sexual intercourse-the problem lies with the man . In another 40 percent , if s the woman with the problem , and in another 20 percent either both partners contribute or the cause is unknown . That adds up to about 10 percent of men who are trying to father a child either being infertile or subfertile ; that translates to roughly 2.5 million men in the United States alone . Men older than 35 are twice as likely to be infertile as men younger than age 26 . In addition , as men age , the genetic quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) declines significantly . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the number of babies born to parents older than age 35 more than doubled from 1970 to 1999 , from 6 percent to 13 percent . This trend has led to the rise in the rates of infertility in the past decade , and to increased miscarriage rates and the possibility of a baby born with Down Syndrome ( in addition to other genetic abnormalities ) . Experts like Dr. Chiledum Ahaghotu , associate professor of urology at Howard University Hospital , are increasingly looking at the male partner first when addressing fertility issues in couples , especially since the initial evaluation of a man can be performed more rapidly and less invasively than with a woman . So why has male infertility been kept under wraps for so long ? The main reason may be the long-held notion that infertility is associated with impotence or decreased masculinity . In a male-driven society , a " real " man is supposed to be able to produce offspring for much of his life . " A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Ahaghotu says . " Male infertility , much like prostate cancer , was traditionally viewed as something that was n't talked about . But increased awareness and dispelling a lot of myths are changing the way we look at the problem . " Male fertility is never a matter of " manliness " or " machismo . " Most times it is a medical issue , some type of mechanical breakdown that has crippled testosterone and sperm production . But dispelling existing myths about men 's roles in pregnancy is not easy in a society where the words " male " and " biological clock " are n't typically used in the same sentence . Medical experts stress that it is important to understand that the male biological clock is n't like that of a woman . It does n't strike at midnight , signaling an absolute end to fertility . It 's more of a gradual process , with testosterone levels declining with age . While women usually get years of warning bells about declining fertility , such as irregular periods and hot flashes , along with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any , symptoms of a man 's declining testosterone level . How fast and how well a man ages-how fast or slow his " clock " ticks-is governed by his genes , his environment and how well he takes care of himself . Photograph A physical examination is one of the first steps to determining a man 's fertility status . // Beyond aging , many things factor into male infertility and sexual dysfunction : decreasing testosterone levels , alcoholism , abdominal fat , diabetes , urinary and prostate infections , and injury . Certain medicines , especially those used to treat high blood pressure , and testicular trauma can also cause a man to lack the ability to produce and deliver sperm . Some disorders become more difficult to treat the longer they persist without treatment . Sometimes a cause of male infertility can be identified , but often no explanation is found . " The most exciting new development in the field of male infertility is the ability to treat men with severe sperm production problems , " says Dr. Marc Goldstein , a leading researcher in male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microsurgical technique that increases the healthy sperm count in men some 128 percent . " Even though these men may have no sperm in their semen , we can now find sperm between the cells of the testicles in almost half of these cases . " The type of treatment recommended usually depends directly on the number of good quality sperm available . Both the number of sperm ( sperm count ) and the quality of that sperm ( its shape and function ) can be improved . Many men have undiagnosed problems with their testicles or reproductive tract that impair their fertility . Fortunately , such problems are often easily treated , and sperm numbers and quality increase as a result . In addition , moderate exercise , a healthy diet and avoidance of substances such as cigarettes that are known to erode sperm quality can also improve fertility . Certain medications often are used to improve sperm production , treat hormonal dysfunction and cure infections that compromise sperm . When medicines are not effective , procedures such as in-vitro fertilization-which involves combining eggs with sperm in a laboratory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryos to the female uterus-is sometimes conducted . But in-vitro fertilization is used most commonly for infertility caused by female reproductive abnormalities , not for male problems . And even when the procedure is successful in fertilization , it results in a live birth only 30 percent of the time , researchers say . Overall , younger patients achieve more favorable results . Whatever the approach to fertility issues , Dr. Fisch says men should know the real facts and lay out a clear path to rewind the biological clock or fix the problems caused by it . Sometimes the steps will be simple and straightforward , such as using an erectionenhancing pill or clearing up an unrecognized infection with antibiotics . Other times more invasive measures must be taken , such as surgery to correct problems in the testicles that affect sperm formation . High-tech reproductive medical technology is now being utilized to treat men with severe sperm production problems . Artificial techniques of reproduction have advanced to the point where a single sperm can be physically injected into an egg . In fact , new medical advances now give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own genetic child . " I have not had any issues related to hesitancy of men about moving forward after they have been diagnosed as being infertile , " says Dr. Ahaghotu , whose patients are almost exclusively Black men . " We know so much more now about male infertility than we did 10 years ago that , once presented with the facts , men take the necessary steps to increase their chances of reproduction .
