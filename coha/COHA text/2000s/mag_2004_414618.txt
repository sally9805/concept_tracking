The architects of today 's PGA Tour venues are starting to remind me of bodybuilding freaks  --  pumping up their creations out of sheer insecurity . It 's time to stop tossing off 7,800-yard monstrosities and begin building layouts that test all aspects of players ' games . It 's time to stop fixating that the Tour pros can hit it a country mile , because that 's not all they can do  --  or should be asked to do . Look at the TPC at Sawgrass , Harbour Town and Westchester Country Club . None of these terrific courses is long by current standards , yet the typical winning score is around eight under par , not the 20-under of the TPC at Everywhere . Such smart tracks call for distance and accuracy as well as creativity and clear thinking . Contrast this with the " new " par-4 12th hole at Torrey Pines in San Diego , which now stretches more than 500 yards , dead straight , into the wind . That 's ridiculous and boring . Maybe it 's a failure of imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tees back near the parking lot and saying they 've toughened the layout for the modern player . It 's the safe move  --  but it 's the wrong move . Why not use trees , clever bunkering and inventive , smaller green designs to make the pros shape shots both ways and force them to control distance and direction ? This will also slow the frantic race to find the lightest drivers and hottest balls  --  players will start to demand equipment they can command with precision . The model should be the innovative work of Pete Dye and Tom Doak , whose designs are visually striking and force players to make decisions , penalizing the incorrect shot as much as the errant one . That 's a blueprint other architects should copy , but it 's not an easy task for muscleheads . Tiger 's Trouble At The Masters I asked Tiger Woods about his surgically repaired left knee , which I had a hunch still was n't 100 percent . I figured he 'd respond curtly , and he did : He said the knee was fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming off the ground sooner than ever . This means he is n't driving his lower body through like he used to . Whether it 's to avoid pain or not , his faulty footwork is causing him to hang back on his right side and either flip the club closed with his hands or else block the shot to the right . Woods has to ditch this bad habit or he wo n't return to top form . Armchair Officials It 's time the USGA got with it and changed the Rules to prevent TV viewers from calling in purported violations . " Ernie Els 's ball moved on the 11th hole at Augusta National ! " " Stewart Cink broke the loose-impediments rule at Harbour Town ! " Enough already . We have expert Rules officials standing a few feet from the players  --  let them do their jobs . TV cameras can distort images ; I 'll take the official 's view over that of someone in a living room 2,000 miles away .
