Chapter One Friday I ca n't believe how fast Mello and Harmony became my best-ever friends after I moved to California . Of course , starting our own band definitely helped . The Chosen Girls have had so many crazy experiences together-that stuff makes for way serious bonding . It 's cool because it feels like I 've known them forever , instead of just a year . Sometimes I wish they knew me as well as I know them , and sometimes I 'm glad they do n't . I mean , they know me . They just do n't know everything about me . Like , that my family is n't the perfect family they think we are . It 's not like my friends could n't handle the truth-maybe I 'm the one who ca n't deal . * * * I leaned across the cafeteria table and asked , " So we 're meeting at the tryouts , right ? " " S , " Harmony answered . " Four thirty . That should give us time to warm up . " Mello tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bands will show . " Jasmine , a friend from church sitting at the next table , turned around and said , " Could n't help overhearing . What are you trying out for ? " " Pizza Pete 's wants a band for their new ad campaign , " I explained . Jasmine looked starstruck . " That is so awesome . Do you Chosen Girls even know how cool you are ? " " We have a pretty good idea , " Harmony said , grinning then ducking to avoid the wadded-up napkin Mello chucked at her . " So will the ads , like , be on TV ? " Jasmine asked . Makayla 's voice came from behind me . " Yes , they 'll be on TV , and the Makayla Simmons band ca n't wait to star in them . " I saw Makayla , the self-appointed leader of the Snob Mob , standing between tables with a tiny girl I did n't recognize . " So you 're trying out too ? " I asked , forcing my mouth into a smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know why anyone else should bother showing up . " " Are you the Chosen Girls ? " asked the girl with Makayla . I said , " Yeah , hi . What 's your name ? " The petite girl grinned shyly and said , " I 'm Reesie . " Even though her hair and eyes were still the same mousy brown , her whole face seemed to glow when she smiled . Makayla huffed in obvious disgust . " Reesie , this is Harmonica , " she said with a shrug in Harmony 's direction . " That 's Melodious , and you 're speaking to Trendy . " " That 's what Makayla calls us , " I said . " The rest of the world knows us as Harmony , Mello , and Trin . Are you new at James Moore ? " She nodded . " New to California too . Just moved here from Oregon . " " You 'll love it , " Mello offered . " There 's so much to- " Makayla held onto her empty lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . " Yeah , well , she 's not looking for things to do or for new friends . But since she 's my new bass player , it 's probably good she met the ' other ' band . Not that you 're any real competition . " I bit my lip to keep from pointing out how many times our band has left hers in the dust . It did n't matter , because Harmony blurted , " Unless you count the channel 34 contest and the Hopetown Battle of the- " " Yeah , let 's talk about the Battle of the Bands , " Makayla agreed . " The L.A. Battle of the Bands . " Harmony rolled her eyes in frustration . I whispered , " It 's just Makayla , Harmony . Let it go . " Reesie pulled away from Makayla and asked , " Which of you plays bass ? " Harmony lifted her hand . " I do . " " I hear you 're fantastic , " Reesie offered . " Maybe we could jam sometime . " Makayla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing or two from you , Reesie . She 's got plenty of room for improvement . " " You must not think she 's too bad , since you begged her to join your band , " I reminded Makayla . Reesie completely ignored our exchange . " So what else are you into ? " Harmony pretended to snap a picture . " I 'm a photographer for the yearbook . And I make jewelry . " She jangled the bracelet on her wrist . " She 's also a blue belt in karate , " Mello added proudly . Makayla put her hand to her face . " Ooh ! I 'm so scared . " Reesie nodded . " Cool . What about you , Mello ? " Mello shrugged . " I 'm the drummer . And I do layouts for the yearbook . " " She designs purses too , " I said , holding up the one Mello made just for me . " That 's hideous , " Makayla said , wrinkling her pug nose . " It 's the exact same shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch the satiny fabric . " I love it . How do I get one ? " Harmony whipped out one of our little business cards . She handed it to Reesie as the bell rang , and everyone started picking up trays and filling the aisles . I stood up and grabbed mine . " I did n't get to find out much about you , Trin , " Reesie apologized . " Maybe next time . Right now , Makayla 's going to show me where my next class is . " " There 's nothing to know about Trin , " Makayla told her as they inched toward the tray return . Even though she faced away from me , I could hear Makayla 's voice clearly . " I do n't know why Trin acts like she 's so great , " Makayla continued . " If Harmony and Mello had n't felt sorry for her and taken her in when she moved here , she 'd be an absolute nobody . She 's just a new girl who sings in the Chosen Girls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a nobody . " I slammed my tray back onto the table . " The new girl ? " I yelled . " A nobody ? I 've been here a whole year ! " Mello and Harmony looked at each other like , Uh-oh . " Is that what people at this school think of me ? That I 'm the new girl who sings for Chosen Girls and that 's it ? " Harmony leaned across the table . " It 's just Makayla , Trin . Let it go . " " Did you guys really feel sorry for me ? " I asked , dropping back into my seat as Makayla 's words sunk in . " Is that why you 're my friends ? " " Right , Trin , " Mello answered . " There 's something about you that brings out our natural feelings of pity . Maybe it 's the fact that you 're drop-dead gorgeous and always dressed like a runway model . " " Or it could be your outgoing personality , " Harmony added . Mello grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you make an electric guitar sing . Poor Trin . " " You 're so pitiful we had to force ourselves to take you in , " Harmony finished . She reached across the table to give my shoulder a squeeze , then she and Mello picked up their stuff and joined the crowd waiting to turn in trays . I made myself follow them , but I did n't join in their conversation about Reesie and how someone so nice could have ended up in Makayla 's band . As I put my tray on the conveyor belt and watched it disappear , I thought , What if everyone in the school thinks like Makayla ? There is more to me than singing in our band . The time has come for me to show the people of James Moore what I 'm made of . * * * That afternoon , I sat in science , trying to listen but unable to stop thinking about Makayla and what I could do to prove myself to her-something that would show the whole school who I am . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my inbox to find the text message : Hi , honey . Sorry it 's been so long since I 've written . I may be in your area two weeks from now , and I 'd like to come see you if I can work it out . Love , Jake As soon as I saw his name , I felt that same mixed-up feeling I get every time he decides to write . Excited , angry , hopeful ... sad . How can one person make me feel all that ? I guess that 's the power a father has . Especially one who walks out on you when you 're just four years old . I did n't reply to his message in class . I knew better than to try that . Mrs. Lewis would take up my phone in a flash . I did n't want to end up explaining to everybody in science about Jake . I had n't even told Harmony and Mello about Mom 's divorce and that my biological father lived in Colorado . It did n't seem necessary , since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I turned seven . For all anyone in Hopetown knew , we were a perfect family . My real father 's leaving was ancient history and had nothing to do with my life now . Besides , for some stupid reason , his messages usually make me cry . So I spent the rest of class worrying about Jake 's text message and what Makayla said . I did n't learn a thing about the periodic table . Just a bunch of letters and numbers up there on the wall . When the bell rang I rushed to a bathroom stall . I stood there and held my phone for a while , trying to convince myself I did n't care what Jake had to say . So he was my " real " dad . So , even now , I could remember each word of the goofy lullaby he sang to me every night . And the spicy smell of his aftershave when I kissed him good-bye every morning . Until that one morning , when I woke up and he was n't there . Did those memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I had n't heard from him for two years ? I 'd like to come see you . Did he mean it ? He always promised to come , but he never showed . What if he really came this time ? Would it be good or bad for him to visit me in Hopetown ? I left the bathroom and pushed through the crowded hall . I thought about my friends he 'd never met and events we 'd won that he did n't know about . Would he be impressed with my life here ? What would he think of California ? Of the Chosen Girls ? More important , what would my father think of me ? success ? " " And just how do you suggest I do that ? " she asked , as we stopped outside her next class . " And do n't say , ' By letting the Chosen Girls be in it . ' It 's strictly amateur . " " Wait , " I said , leaning against the door frame . " When is it ? " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What if my band did a grand finale kind of thing ? Like while the judges tally the scores . " Her face lit up . " Would you really ? You 'd do that for me ? Do n't say it if you do n't mean it . Because , Trin , I 'm telling you , I think if a big-name band like yours got involved , it might get other people interested . Maybe we could even get on the news or something ! " The warning bell rang . " I 've got ta go , " I said . " But count on the Chosen Girls . And count on me too . " " Thanks , Trin , " she yelled after me . " I 'm so stoked . You 're saving me from social suicide . Finally , it wo n't just be the nobody show . " As I rushed down the hall , Latisha 's words echoed in my head . Maybe I could help her out and help myself at the same time . I knew I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I 'm not a nobody , I thought . I wo n't be " the new girl who 's in Chosen Girls . " I 'll be Trin Adams , whose leadership skills transformed the show-and the whole school-into something to be proud of . And if my real father happens to visit during the talent show and get blown away by the way-fabulous job his daughter did on it , well , that wo n't hurt , either . (
