Troublesome Mesa , Colorado Autumn , 2008 A Catholic orphan of sixty years is not apt to forget the day he first learned that he was born Jewish . It would not have been that bombastic an event , except that I am running for the presidency of the United States . The 2008 election is less than a week away . Earlier in the day , my in-close staff looked at one another around the conference table . We digested the numbers . Not only were we going to win , there was no way we were going to lose . Thank God , none of the staff prematurely uttered the words " Mr. President . " This morning was ten thousand years ago . I 'm Quinn Patrick O'Connell , governor of Colorado and the Democratic candidate for president . The voters know I was adopted through the Catholic bureaucracy by the ranchers Dan and Siobhan O'Connell . My dad and I were Irish enough , at each other 's throats . Thanks to my mom , we all had peace and a large measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All things being equal , it appeared that I would be the second Roman Catholic president in American history . Unknown to me until earlier this day , I would be the first Jewish president as well . Nothing compares to the constant melancholy thirst of the orphan to find his birth parents . It is the apparatus that forms us and rules us . Aye , there was always someone out there , a faceless king and queen in a chilled haze , taunting . Ben Horowitz , my half brother , had been searching for me , haunted , for over a half century . Today he found me . Tomorrow at one o'clock Rocky Mountain time I must share my fate with the American people . You have n't heard of Rocky time ? Some of the networks have n't , either . Lot of space but small market . The second half of the last century held the years that the Jews became one of the prime forces in American life . Politically , there had been a mess of Jewish congressmen , senators , mayors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the big enchilada . I suppose the buck stops here . Had I been elected governor as Alexander Horowitz , I 'd have been just as good for my state . However , the discovery of my birth parents a week before the presidential election could well set off a series of tragic events from the darkness where those who will hate me lay in wait . How do I bring this to you , folks ? In the last few hours I have written , " my fellow Americans " twenty-six times , " a funny thing happened to me on the way to Washington " twenty-one times , and " the American people have the right to know " three dozen times . My wastebasket overfloweth . Do n't cry , little Susie , there will be a Christmas tree on the White House lawn . No , the White House kitchen will not be kosher . My love of Carnegie tongue and pastrami is not of a religious nature . By presidential decree , the wearing of a yarmulke is optional . Israel will not become our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I simply do not know what this means in my future . O'Connell was a hell of a good governor , but we are in uncharted waters . I 'm getting a little fuzzy . I can see into the bedroom , where Rita is sprawled in the deep part of a power nap . Rita and our bedroom and her attire are all blended with Colorado hush tones , so soft and light in texture . At the ranch Rita liked to wear those full and colorful skirts like a Mexican woman at fiesta . As she lays there a bit rumpled , I can see up her thighs . I 'd give my horse and saddle to be able to crawl alongside her . But then , I 'd never finish my Washington 's farewell to the troops speech . On the other hand , Rita and I have made the wildest gung-ho love when we were under the deepest stress . Write your speech , son , you 've got to " face the nation " tomorrow , Rocky Mountain time . Straight narrative , no intertwining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truth , baby , truth . At least truth will not come back to haunt you . Strange , I should be thinking of Greer at this moment . Rita is the most sensual soul mate one could pray for . We have loved one another without compromise for nearly thirty years . Yet , is it possible that Greer is really the love of my life ? I 'd have never come this far in the campaign without Greer Little 's genius . I would have been tossed into the boneyard of candidates never heard from again . She organized , she raised money , she knew the political operatives , and she masterminded my " miracle " campaign . I was struck by the realization that Greer would leave soon , and I felt the same kind of agony as when we broke up years before . I had needed to see Greer on some business , and knocked and entered her room . She had been on the bed with Rita , passed-out drunk . Rita had held her and soothed her as though she were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips to tell me to be quiet . Well , there was life without Greer , but there could be no life without Rita . Yet it still hurts . I watch the hours flow in the passageway behind me like the tick of a suppressed bomb about to be released . I am through with a draft . I write another . As the hours to dawn tick off , it all seems to come down to the same basic questions . Am I telling the truth ? Do the American people have the civility and the decency to take the truth and rise with it ?
