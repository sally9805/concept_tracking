// When Early January - 10 p.m . Late January - 9 p.m . Early February - 8 p.m . Late February - Dusk In other months : Early October - 5 a.m. * Early November - 2 a.m . Early December - Midnight * 1aylight Saving Time How Go out within an hour or so of the time listed at left . Turn the map around so the edge marked with the direction you 're facing is down . The stars above this horizon on the map now match the stars in front of you . The map 's center is overhead . So a star plotted halfway from the edge to the center can be found in the sky about halfway from horizontal to straight up . For example : As you 're holding the map right now , the south horizon is down . About halfway from that horizon to the center is the constellation Orion . Go out , face south , and look about halfway from horizontal to straight up . There 's Orion ! ( Planets are positioned for mid-February . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , Denver , New York , Madrid ) . If you 're far south of there , stars in the southern part of the sky will be higher and stars in the north lower . Far north of 40 deg the reverse is true . Another Double Cluster ONE OF THE FINEST BINOCULAR OBJECTS IS THE FAMOUS DOUBLE CLUSTER in Perseus . But there 's also a lesser-known double cluster in Gemini high overhead on winter evenings . Compared with the Perseus pairing of twin , rich clusters , the Gemini clusters M35 and NGC 2158 are a celestial odd couple . M35 is a bright and easy binocular target , while NGC 2158 is faint and challenging . M35 is Gemini 's most rewarding binocular sight . It contains numerous stars bright enough to be seen in ordinary binoculars , as well as a smattering of fainter ones that pop in and out of view . NGC 2158 is a different kettle of fish . Here the challenge is to see the cluster at all ! To succeed you will a need dark , moonless sky , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount ) , and binoculars that magnify at least lox . Even then NGC 2158 will appear as an extremely dim , small hazy glow situated on the southwest edge of M35 . To fully appreciate the sight , keep in mind that you are seeing the effect of distance . M35 is about 3,000 light-years away , while NGC 2158 lurks in the background , five or six times farther away . <p>
