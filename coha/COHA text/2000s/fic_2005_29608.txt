Chapter One To be perfectly blunt and unprofessional , my lineup that day read like the maladjusted all-star team of Manhattan . My nine o'clock was a bulimic , twice-divorced executive who was having an affair with her married boss . My ten o'clock was a guilt-ridden kleptomaniac who could never keep what he stole . He was always revisiting stores in order to put things back . Then came my eleven o'clock . So to speak . A sexually compulsive cellist who , among other things , liked to masturbate in the backseat of cabs . I suppose it goes without saying that she lived well beyond walking distance to my office . A couple of hours for lunch and paperwork , and it was time to reload . Two o'clock : a soap-opera actor who could no longer distinguish between himself and the character he played . Next up was my three o'clock . On second thought , do n't get me started on my three o'clock . Finally , there was my last patient of the day . My four o'clock . The main reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin Daniels . A struggling young writer who 'd written seven spec screenplays and had yet to sell any of them . Unable to drop the word aspiring from his desired profession , Kevin 's frustration had manifested in a deep and bitter hatred of the very people he so much wanted to impress . To Kevin , Hollywood was n't just populated by mere assholes or idiots . Rather it was infested with , and I quote , culturally retarded wayward whores destined to make feel-good-movie johns out of all of us . End quote . I could only imagine how his screenplays read . But on this particular afternoon , an overcast Thursday in the middle of October , Kevin arrived at my office with an uncharacteristic smile . He professed to having significant news . " I 've had a moment of intense clarity , an epiphany , " he said . He leaned forward and lowered his voice to a whisper . " I need to be in the belly of the beast . " He stopped and stared at me . " So you- " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm moving , David . I 'm going to Hollywood . " " The belly of the beast , as you say . " " You got it . " " To fight the battle from within . " " Exactly , " he said . I nodded , my face giving away nothing . " Are you sure this is a move you want to make ? " " Not only am I sure , I 've practically already done it , " came his answer . " I flew out there last weekend and rented a place in Hollywood Hills . I 'll be heading back there for good the day after tomorrow . " " You 're not wasting any time , are you ? " " Not if I can help it . " " Have you told your parents ? " I asked . " They cosigned on the new apartment . " " I take it that means they approve ? " " I would n't go that far , " said Kevin , his palms raised . " My parents know they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . What about you , though , David ? Do you approve of my moving ? " I cautioned myself . Much about psychotherapy , or at least the way I approached it , was predicated on the belief that an opinion should never do more harm than good . My job was not to ferret out right from wrong in any absolute sense . Only what was right or wrong for a particular patient . Kevin was waiting for my answer . " Do I approve of your moving ? " I said slowly . " To be honest , I 'm not sure my thoughts have anything to do with approving or disapproving . The important thing-and this is something you and I have been talking about for quite some time-is that no one has more control over your life than you do . While that fact alone wo n't guarantee you success , it will guarantee you the right to make your own decisions . For better or worse . " " In other words , fuck anyone who disapproves , " said Kevin . " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with that . " After looking at each other in silence for a few seconds , we both realized that continuing to talk merely because we had time left in the hour would be silly . Kevin told me I should still charge him for a full session . " No , this one 's on the house , " I said . " Really ? " " Sure . Buy two hundred , get one free . " He laughed and we shook hands . I wished him luck . After taking a few steps toward the door , Kevin turned and looked back . " The belly of the beast , " he said . " That 's where you can find me . " Then he left . And that 's how it came to be . Why I remember that day so well . I 'd told Kevin what I 'd been telling him repeatedly over four years : that no one can have more control over your life than you do . It was pretty good advice , I thought . Too bad it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leaving created an opening in my schedule ... and the person who filled it was going to be all the proof I needed . ( Continues ... )
