Seattle-December 2005 <p> " I swear to God , I 'm going to kill her , " he whispered . <p> Erin Travino did n't pay attention to the man seated in the row behind her . She switched on her cell phone , activating the little blue display light . It glowed in the darkened movie theater . Erin punched in the code to check her messages again . <p> Up on the big screen in front of her , Judi Dench was reprimanding Keira Knightley for something . Erin had n't paid much attention to Pride and Prejudice . Maybe she should have been . She had a book report due next week , and had n't even chosen the stupid book yet . If she 'd been following the movie more closely , she could have pretended to have read Pride and Prejudice . Her English Lit teacher was a sucker for Jane Austen . <p> Then again , she really did n't have to try too hard at school lately . Most of her teachers were cutting her some slack . Erin simply had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , and her teachers would grant her an extension or raise her C to a B minus . <p> Erin intended to milk the situation for as long as she could . Along with Molly Gerrard , and that nut job , Warren Tunny , she was prominently featured in all the newspaper articles . The Seattle Post-Intelligencer even ran a photo of her , the halfway-decent snapshot from her high school ID . At least her wavy , shoulder-length , auburn hair was freshly washed , and the dimpled smile looked natural . Plus she appeared really thin in the picture . <p> Erin was constantly dieting , even though her friends insisted it was the last thing in the world she needed to do . Tonight , for example , her best friend , Kim , had bought a soda and a large buttered popcorn for the movie . Kim asked if she wanted some popcorn , but Erin just shook her head and sipped her medium Diet Coke . Did n't Kim know that stuff had the fat equivalent of three Big Macs ? At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the illuminated display on her cell phone : NO NEW MESSAGES . <p> Someone tapped her on the shoulder , startling her . Erin almost dropped the phone . She glanced over her shoulder . <p> " Would you mind putting your phone away ? " growled the man behind her . He was in his late thirties-as was the lean , Asian guy with him . " The light is very distracting . " <p> Erin shifted in her cushioned seat . " Well , I was n't talking on it , " she whispered , rolling her eyes . <p> The man glared at her . The light from the movie screen flickered across his handsome , narrow face . " That 's the fifth time you 've pulled out your phone and switched it on since the movie started . Do you have ADD or something ? How about showing a little courtesy for the people around you , huh ? " <p> Her mouth open , Erin let out a stunned little laugh . <p> Suddenly her phone chimed out this ancient tune , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring tones . She 'd programmed it by accident last week and could n't undo the damn thing . <p> " Shit , " she muttered . A few people in nearby seats shushed her . The man and his buddy were frowning and shaking their heads . <p> Flustered , Erin grabbed her purse and retreated up the aisle toward the lobby . Ignoring the filthy looks from several people seated along the aisle , she pressed the Talk button on her phone . " Hello ? " she whispered , pushing at the door with her shoulder . She stepped into the narrow , dimly lit foyer . The door swung shut behind her . <p> " Hello ? " Erin repeated , louder this time . <p> She heard a click . Frowning , she checked the caller ID : NUMBER NOT LISTED . <p> With a sigh , Erin headed into the Harvard Exit Theater 's lobby . They showed mostly foreign and independent films . Erin got a waft of popcorn smell as she wandered through the large lobby . It had a fireplace , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were true to the building 's 1920s architecture . The concessions stand was in the far corner , and beyond that , a stairway to the restrooms and another theater on the third floor . <p> Erin paused at the foot of the stairs . She dialed Molly 's number and got her machine again . Erin clicked off . She 'd already left three messages . They 'd arranged to meet in front of the movie theater tonight . But Molly had never shown . <p> Molly was one of the most popular girls in Erin 's class . She was thin and pretty with gorgeous , long , black hair that was right out of a shampoo commercial . Molly wore designer glasses , and somehow managed to look chic-even in just a sweater and jeans . Molly 's stock only went up after what had happened last week . Erin 's stock soared , too . Suddenly , she mattered . <p> The day before yesterday , Molly had asked if she wanted to hang out after school . They went to pick up a new pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glasses had square lenses with tortoiseshell frames , slightly nerdy , very funky . Only someone as popular and pretty as Molly could have worn them without looking like a total dork . While in the optical shop with her new friend , Erin wished she had weak eyes so she could get glasses like Molly Gerrard . Afterward , they had Diet Cokes and shared a plate of cheese fries at the Broadway Grill . Erin ate only seven fries and was still hungry , but it did n't matter . She felt so cool , hanging out with Molly . <p> Kim was an okay friend . But Molly was queen of the " A " crowd , and being friends with her put Erin in the " A " crowd , too . She was devastated Molly had n't shown up for the movie tonight . Erin wondered if she 'd done something wrong . Maybe Molly did n't want to hang out with her and Kim . Kim was n't " A " list . But no , that was n't like Molly ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what must have happened when she glanced over toward the lobby and spotted one of the older guys who had been sitting behind her . It was the man 's friend , the slim Asian guy . He seemed to be headed for the concessions stand , but his eyes suddenly locked with hers . He passed by the concessions counter and came toward her . <p> Erin automatically turned and started up the stairs . She was n't afraid of him ; she just did n't feel like hearing another lecture about movie theater etiquette . Halfway up the stairs , Erin figured she could duck into the women 's room and avoid him altogether . But the cell phone slipped out of her hand and skipped down a few steps . <p> The man paused on the landing-in front of a huge old poster for An American in Paris . He retrieved her cell phone , climbed the stairs , and plopped the phone in her hand . " Well , I know you could n't live without this now , could you ? " he muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Brushing past her , the man started up the next flight of stairs-probably to the men 's restroom on the third floor . But he paused and glanced back down at her . " A thank you might have been nice , " he said . " You know , you 're very rude . " Shaking his head , he continued up the stairs . <p> Erin wanted to say , " Well , screw you ! " But instead , she just retreated into the women 's room . It was dimly lit and slightly creepy . The partition housing the two stalls was painted dark green , and the floor was old , chipped black-and-white tile-little hexagons . The old sink had separate faucets for the hot and cold water , and there were rust stains on the porcelain . <p> Erin could hear people laughing in the smaller theater upstairs . Some comedy from Italy was showing . <p> She caught herself frowning in the bathroom mirror . She flicked back her auburn hair . That guy who had just called her rude would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . Obviously , he had n't seen the newspaper last week . They called her a hero for what she did . A hero . <p> It had happened last Tuesday in Mr. Gunther 's fifth period study hall . Only about half of the students actually studied or did their homework in study hall ; the rest napped , doodled , or tried to pass notes to each other . Gunther , a short , wiry , balding , forty-something wannabe-jock , would n't let anyone talk while he lorded over the classroom . He was a real hardass . He sat at the front of class with his nose buried in the Seattle Times sports section . <p> Erin was at her desk by the windows in the last row , listlessly paging through her Us Weekly . Gunther was such a Nazi , he 'd assigned seats and would n't let anyone switch . Erin was stuck with a view of the faculty parking lot on one side and squirrelly Warren Tunny on the other . <p> Warren sat hunched over his sketchpad . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross between SpongeBob SquarePants and Godzilla . Erin never admitted it , but she found his drawings fascinating-gory , graphic , and oddly funny . No one else appreciated Warren 's artwork-except maybe his geek buddies , if he even had any buddies . Erin could n't see what he was drawing at that moment . His arm and shoulder blocked her view . He was probably protecting his sketch pad . It was new . The previous week , while Warren had been at his locker , one of the guys had grabbed his old sketch pad out of his hands and torn it up in front of him . Erin had n't seen it happen , but she heard Warren had cried . <p> The guys were constantly picking on him and the girls made fun of him . Warren was skinny , with a pale , splotchy complexion and ugly , kinky , rust-colored hair that he parted on the side . Some of the guys called him " Pubes " because of that awful hair . Erin felt sorry for him , but the guy was definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school every day-even in warm weather . And he kept it on all day long . <p> Bored , Erin tried to peek at what Warren was drawing . She still could n't see the sketch pad . But she noticed something shiny inside Warren 's fatigue jacket . It looked like a gun . <p> Erin gasped . <p> Warren stopped drawing and stared at her . <p> Quickly , she turned away and did her best to look bored . With a shaky hand , she flipped through a few pages of her magazine . After a minute , she swallowed hard and stole a glance over at Warren again . He seemed focused on his artwork once more . She could clearly see it now , the gun handle sticking out of his inside coat pocket . <p> How the hell had he smuggled a gun past the metal detectors ? <p> Biting her lip , she helplessly glanced around the classroom-at the other students and at Gunther up in front . None of them had a clue . <p> She was the only one who knew Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erin wondered if maybe-just maybe-the gun was a fake . She tried to catch another glimpse of it . Just then , Warren leaned back , and Erin saw his sketchpad-and what he 'd been drawing . <p> It was a very creepy , detailed rendition of a smiling skull , with a caption underneath it : THEY WILL BE SORRY . Then , below that , he 'd drawn a circle with a strange , tilted " V " inside that circle . Below this cryptic image , he 'd written in even bigger letters than before , embellished with vines winding around each consonant and vowel : PREPARE TO DIE . <p> Warren sighed , glanced up at the clock for a moment , and then went back to his drawing . <p> Erin looked up at the clock , too : 1:05 . <p> She suddenly realized , the tilted " V " inside the circle was supposed to be the hands of a clock . Her mouth open , she watched Warren draw the clock digits around the inside parameter of that circle-1:10 was the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now . <p> Was that when he planned to start shooting ? <p> She could be wrong . Still , she was n't about to wait until he pulled his gun out to know for sure . Her heart pounded furiously , and she could hardly breathe . She had to do something . Her cell phone was in her purse . Gunther did n't allow people to use them during his study hall , and she could n't pass anyone a note . Warren was her only neighbor . <p> Biting her lip , Erin glanced around the classroom again-at all her classmates , looking so bored , so unaware that within minutes there could be screams and blood and chaos . Erin glanced at the clock on the wall again : 1:07 . Hunched forward , she took her spiral notebook out of her purse , opened it , and jotted down a few words . She glanced over her shoulder to make sure Warren could n't see what she was writing . Then she tore the piece of paper from the notebook and folded it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad . Erin was n't sure why he 'd done that . Maybe his work was finished . He probably did n't want anyone in the class to see it-not just yet . Perhaps it was for later , for the police to discover . Erin felt a chill race through her . <p> Warren 's eyes met hers for a moment . Erin tried to smile , but it was forced , and she quickly looked away . He could probably see her shaking . <p> Warren sat back at his desk and studied the clock by the classroom door . He seemed to be breathing hard . His hand-black ink and pencil lead on the fingers-slowly reached inside his fatigue jacket . <p> Grabbing her purse , Erin unsteadily got to her feet . " Mr. Gunther ? " she said , hardly able to get the words out . Any minute now , she expected Warren to shoot her in the back . Making her way to the front of the classroom , she approached Gunther 's desk . She tightly clutched her purse against her stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely looked over the top of his newspaper . " Go back to your seat , " he muttered . <p> Erin cleared her throat . " Mr. Gunther , I need to use the restroom . I have a-a problem . " She handed him the note she 'd just written , then started for the door . <p> " I said , back to your seat ! " he barked . His chair made a scraping noise on the floor as he pushed himself back from the teacher 's desk . Everyone was looking at them . <p> Erin headed for the door . She was n't sure she would make it . Her hand fumbled for the knob , then she swung open the door and ducked out to the hallway . She could hear people murmuring , and Gunther 's voice : " All right , enough ! I want quiet ! " <p> Erin shut the door behind her . But she still could n't get her breath . This was n't over yet . It had n't even begun . <p> There was a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erin could see Gunther standing at his desk with her note in his hand . But he had n't looked at it yet . He scowled at everyone in the classroom . " I want quiet ! " he repeated . She could hear his muffled voice through the closed door . <p> Pulling her cell phone out of her purse , Erin switched it on and dialed 9-1-1 . It rang twice . Through the window in the door , she watched Mr. Gunther finally glance down at her note . <p> She had n't had much time to write anything . All it said was : " Warren Tunny has a gun in his jacket . I 'll call 9-1-1 . " <p> A click interrupted the third ring tone : " Seattle Police Emergency , " the woman said . " 9-1-1 operator . " <p> For a moment , Erin was speechless . She was watching Gunther 's reaction . Frowning , he set her note on the desk , then glanced in Warren 's direction . " Tunny , stand up ! " she heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you stupid son of a bitch , she wanted to scream . <p> Erin became aware of the 9-1-1 operator on the other end of the line : " Police Emergency . Can I help you ? " <p> " Yes , I-I 'm not absolutely sure if this is a real emergency , " Erin said under her breath . " But-but I think maybe- " <p> " Could you please speak up ? " the operator interrupted . " What 's the nature of your emergency ? " <p> While the operator talked , Erin could hear Gunther 's voice , raised in anger . Suddenly a girl in the classroom screamed : " Oh , God , no ! " Then there were more screams , and it sounded like someone knocked over a chair . <p> " Oh , Jesus , " Erin said , louder this time , her voice cracking . " I 'm at-at-James Madison High School , outside room 207 , and this guy 's got a gun ... " <p> Through the window in the door , she could see Gunther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified . Any minute now , she expected to hear the first shot . <p> The 9-1-1 operator was telling her to remain calm . The woman wanted to know if anyone had been hurt and how many gunmen there were . <p> " It 's just one guy , a student , Warren Tunny . I 'm outside the classroom right now , but I can still see them in there . I- " Erin fell silent as she caught a glimpse of Warren and Mr. Gunther in the window . Warren pressed the gun barrel to Gunther 's head . The wiry little hard-ass teacher was cringing and trembling . <p> " Everyone , just shut up and sit down ! " Warren screamed . He shook even worse than Gunther . Warren 's face was so flushed it was almost matched the color of his frizzy red hair . " I mean it , shut the hell up , all of you ... " <p> " Oh , my God , " Erin whispered into the phone , backing away from the door . " I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , do something ! Send the police here ... " <p> " All right , stay calm and tell me your name , " the operator said . <p> " Erin-Erin Travino . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
