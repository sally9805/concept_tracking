" - Frankie Andreu This is the first chance for contenders to mark the race . So far , it 's been a fistfight among sprinters . Who Stomps : Probably Lance Armstrong 's U.S. Postal Service squad , but Kevin Livingston says T-Mobile might be tough . Andreu says CSC and Rabobank could rock . Who 's Stomped : Strong overall threats on weak teams are hurt most-think Roberto Heras on Liberty-Seguros . Wild Card : A new rule limits maximum TTT time loss to three ? minutes , no matter how far behind your team finishes . The gap should be five minutes to prevent slacking , says Bernard Hinault : " If you know you 'll lose just three , why kill yourself ? " Upshot : After the TTT all major contenders will be closer together than in past Tours . " While they may lose time on someone like Armstrong , they will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PYRENEES STAGE 12 : Castelsarrasin-La Mongie , 199km , July 16 STAGE 13 : Lannemezan-Plateau de Beille , 217km , July 17 " If Armstrong has the legs , he 'll take the opportunity to try to Kill everyone . " - Kevin Livingston Climbers such as Heras and Iban Mayo will be aggressive , says Cyril Guimard , but the jockeying is less for time than for " mental advantage , " says Livingston : " If you come off a guy 's wheel you might lose 15 seconds , but you know you got dropped . " Who Stomps : The climbers-or Armstrong . Some racers fear that if they make him mad , he 'll obliterate the pack . " Guys will still be wary of attacking , " says Livingston . Who 's Stomped : The peloton , if Armstrong goes big . Li ' 02 , he beat Joseba Beloki here by more than a minute to put his lead out of reach . Wild Card : If Armstrong gets the jersey , Postal will scrap to keep it , says Andreu : " They 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to start building leads that can withstand the time they 'll lose in the final TT , says Andreu .

" - Cyril Guimard For the first time ever , a time trial climbs the most mythical road in Tour de France lore . Says Guimard : " It 's a pure sign of who is climbing and time-trialing the best , and that 's what the Tour is all about . " Who Stomps : Tyler Hamilton gets Andreu 's dark-horse vote . But Merckx picks Armstrong : " For me , he is the best climber . " Who 's Stomped : Everybody who is n't first . " Whoever wins Alpe d'Huez wins the Tour , " says Jim Ochowicz . Wild Card : A great rider on a weak team might win here but lose the Tour if the TT and the tough Alpine stage before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day 's climb through the Alps .

" - Bernard Hinault Because the racers will be tired , " the gap from the stage winner to second place will be more than a minute , " says Livingston . Who Stomps : " If Lance is anywhere close to the overall lead , he is physically and mentally unbeatable , " says Andreu . Who 's Stomped : Pity the climbers who clawed to top spots only to see their hopes evaporate here . Wild Card : " Besancon will be a confirmation stage for the winner , but for the other spots it 'll be a shake-up . Someone who is fifth could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upshot : " Last year , in pursuit of a few seconds , Ullrich was relentless , " says Livingston , the only racer to have ridden for both Armstrong and Ullrich . " But if Lance makes it to the final time trial in the lead , he 's got six . " AND WATCH OUT FOR . . . A FEW UNHERALDED STAGES ALWAYS BECOME SPOILERS . HERE ARE 3 FOR ' 04 . STAGE 3-Waterloo to Wasquehal , 195km : " There is a section of cobblestones , " says Echavarri . " The Tour wo n't be won there , but it could be lost " if a rider crashes . STAGE 10-Limoges to Saint-Flour , 237km : It 's more hilly than mountainous-but is also the longest stage of the Tour . STAGE 15-Valreas to Villard-de-Lans , 179km : The first Alpine stage " is up and down , up and down , and takes a lot of power , " says Andreu .
