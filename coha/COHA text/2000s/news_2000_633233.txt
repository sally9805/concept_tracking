<p> Recently , my 3-year-old son impatiently told me , " Mommy , I need the Buzz Lightyears and the Winnie the Poohs ! " eagerly pointing to the 24-pack Valentine assortment intended for his preschool classmates . Most of us , when we were very young , considered the most important day of this month to be St. Valentine 's Day . Heart-shaped cards , candies and cupids still beckon us from store aisles and shelves . <p> Yet the most memorable gifts that we received are not store-bought or prepackaged but rather those that reflect the true intent of the giver and have lasting , powerful and positive effects on us . Valentine 's Day must not overshadow the importance of the entire month . <p> As February celebrates American history and recognizes the history and achievements of African Americans , it is imperative that African-American Revolutionary War patriots be remembered during this most important month . America 's freedom from the dictates of the British crown might not have been won without their commitment to the cause . <p> We must never forget : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British muskets leveled against him without fear and became the first casualty of the Boston Massacre . <p> The courage demonstrated by the First Rhode Island Regiment  --  the 125 African-American patriots who participated in many battles . <p> The fortitude of James Forten , who at 14 , as part of the first Navy , was captured by the British and imprisoned for refusing to give up his allegiance to the United States . <p> The integrity of Quok Walker , who won his freedom from slavery in 1781 by challenging the newly established Massachusetts State Constitution , and whose victory resulted in the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts . <p> The beautiful eloquence and profound insight of Phillis Wheatley , who by age 13 had published her first book of poetry and expressed the sentiments of American patriotism in her highly acclaimed poem " Liberty and Peace . " <p> So , even though we are confronted this month by the exaggerated materialism of Valentine 's Day , we should all take some time to consider with sincere affection and grateful hearts those who sacrificed so much to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Carol A. Marsh , Oak Lawn <p> Nuke shipments safe <p> It seems both hypocritical and silly for us to worry whether more nuclear fuel shipments pass through Illinois than other states ( " Nuke shipment battle brewing , " news story , Jan. 30 ) . <p> Illinois has a substantial number of nuclear plants that have supplied its residents with a large fraction of their electricity . In so doing , these plants have accumulated considerable used fuel , and moving it to a safe disposal site certainly benefits us . Increasing the rate of nuclear shipments , even by " 4,000 percent , " places Illinois and its residents at no additional risk . <p> Of course , nuclear waste is a hazardous material , but the technology and regulations to properly deal with it are in place . Transportation of nuclear fuel is much safer  --  and the accident consequences lower  --  than many of the road hazards we blithely ignore . These include thousands of shipments per day of gasoline and toxic chlorine that are not nearly as well safeguarded . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary hazardous chemical shipment on our busy highways , the effect would be small , but the highways would actually be safer ! <p> It is time to get real about moving used fuel to the Nevada disposal facility . We can start by not frightening ourselves with risks that are ridiculously small . <p> Theodore H. Bauer , <p> Downers Grove <p> Confront smoking <p> On Valentine 's Day , the American Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago is asking Gov . Ryan and the Illinois General Assembly to be sweethearts and use at least 50 percent of the proceeds from the tobacco settlement to fund tobacco prevention and education programs . Without a comprehensive tobacco control program , Illinois taxpayers will continue to shoulder the burden of the health costs of tobacco use . <p> Currently , 35 percent of Illinois teens smoke . Without comprehensive programs that address prevention and cessation , we will see this number and the subsequent economic burden increase . Studies repeatedly show the best way to fight tobacco use is to initiate a statewide program that includes public education , school-based and community-based programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hackbarth , American <p> Lung Association of <p> Metropolitan Chicago <p> MJ no know-it-all <p> Michael Jordan is an authority on basketball . His achievements in the sport do n't make him a Mr. Know-it-all . <p> Jordan 's endorsement of Bill Bradley counts only if he is running for the head of the NBA . Jordan 's pitch of any products or candidates unrelated to basketball does n't influence me at all . <p> Eric Lin , Argo <p> Ryan helping pal ? <p> Recently , Gov . Ryan came out in favor of eliminating the toll road system in Illinois ; shortly afterward , he amended his earlier statement to support at least removing some of the tollbooths . <p> A popular , commendable idea , and one that I was immediately enamored of . Had I judged the man too harshly ? Alas , I am suspicious by nature , and my mind would n't stop searching for the ulterior motive . <p> Not too long ago , Illinois legislators , with the approval of the governor , voted to permit riverboat gambling in Rosemont . About a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Illinois : the one right after O'Hare on Interstate 90 . After the casino opens , it 's very likely that tollbooth will be a bottleneck virtually around the clock . Could it be that the governor is trying to help out his buddy ( Rosemont Mayor ) Don Stephens and avert the hue and cry that will inevitably arise if the situation is not resolved now ? <p> Just wondering . <p> Mike Barnes , Inverness <p> Shocking ruling <p> As a retired Chicago police sergeant , I was shocked and appalled by the recent Illinois Supreme Court decision to overturn the conviction of the murderer of police officer Daniel Doffyn and order a new trial because the officer 's bloody uniform was prejudicial evidence , as was the closing argument that appealed for justice for the slain officer 's family ( news story , Final Markets , Jan. 27 ) . <p> I 'm surprised that the justices did n't also feel that perhaps bringing in the TEC-9 ( murder weapon ) or perhaps calling officer Milan Bubalo as an eyewitness to the murder might not also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a victim . This is what is wrong with the judicial system . In our efforts to ensure a fair and impartial trial for all defendants , we have finally reached the stage of insanity . Apparently , any evidence that might elicit any emotion from jurors will be considered prejudicial and inadmissible . <p> I suppose this court would have felt that the evidence under John Wayne Gacy 's house or the contents of Jeffrey Dahmer 's refrigerator might have been prejudicial also . Well , I guess it does n't matter . If the cop-killer ( oops , sorry  --  I mean the young gentleman ) is convicted in his second trial , I 'm sure they 'll sentence him to a " time out . " <p> Rob Sarnowski , <p> Palm Harbor , Fla . <p> Brave decision <p> Gov . Ryan deserves much praise for having the courage to declare a moratorium on the death penalty . <p> Over the last 27 years , innocent defendants , their families and even the families of the murder victims  --  cheated of justice by hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have learned of the 13 reversals of death sentences during that time , some of us have wondered whether the entire criminal justice system has run off the rails . <p> The Chicago Council of Lawyers in 1997 first called for a moratorium on executions . Legislation drafted by our organization died in the General Assembly . That the governor took personal leadership of this issue was both essential to real reform and a promising harbinger of change . <p> Ed McManus , chairman , <p> Committee on the <p> Death Penalty , <p> Chicago Council of Lawyers <p> Hasty solutions <p> In Ald. Burton F. Natarus ' ( 42nd ) attempt to find solutions to the traffic bottlenecks in his ward ( " Natarus urges fare cuts on CTA to ease traffic , " Feb. 3 ) , he identifies construction as one of the causes . The irony is that he personally endorsed each of these projects , which this year will add another 10,000 vehicles to the traffic in the 42nd Ward . <p> The bold solution that his constituents are looking for is an acknowledgment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Natarus 's constituents have been requesting that he hold a public meeting . <p> Natarus fails to understand that lowering CTA fares may encourage more people to leave their cars at home , but lowering city parking taxes on short-term parking or pressuring garages to offer bargain rates would encourage more people to drive . This is evidence that the bold solutions the alderman offered were hastily conceived . <p> Sheldon Landy , Loop
