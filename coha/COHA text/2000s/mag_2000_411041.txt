Looking back , some of those whose lives were torn apart by the bombing tell how time has dealt with their wounds // On April 19 the Oklahoma City National Memorial will be dedicated on the site where , five years ago to the day , the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by a terrorist bomb . The families of those killed will be there , along with the survivors and their rescuers , as well as President Clinton , who is scheduled to attend , and thousands of Americans who wish simply to pay their respects . But the hope on such a sad anniversary is that the ceremony will provide some measure of uplift and a sense of renewal The centerpiece of the memorial will be 168 bronze-and-granite glass-bottomed chairs , each bearing the engraved name of a victim . At night the glass base of the chairs , 19 of which are smaller than the others to represent the children who died , will be lit so that they appear to be floating . Of those who survived the bombing masterminded by Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal penitentiary outside Terre Haute , Ind. , many continue to struggle with the physical and psychic wounds of that terrible day But as a look at the lives of some of the people captured in the most memorable photographs of the tragedy suggests , the healing continues , inexorably if imperfectly An Eternal Bond The photograph was perhaps the most wrenching of the terrible images to come out of Oklahoma City : firefighter Chris Fields tenderly cradling the lifeless body of 1-year-old Baylee Almon . To this day , Baylee has remained a presence in Fields 's life , and he and his wife , Cheryl , have become good friends with Baylee 's mother , Aren . " I never knew Baylee , but there was a kind of attachment , " says Fields , 35 . " It was like I was associated with her . " To be sure , each family has borne its own special burden . Fields acknowledges that he had a difficult time dealing with the demands of fame brought on by the photo . The constant requests for interviews took time away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , as well as 7year-old Ryan , and seriously strained his marriage . Fortunately , as the media frenzy subsided , Chris and Cheryl , 32 , managed to get their life back on track . " My wife and I worked hard to stay together and the past three years have been the best of all , " says Fields , who was promoted to major in 1996 . As things stand now , he has no plans to be present when the national memorial is dedicated on April 19 . " I 'll report to work and watch the ceremony on TV , " he says .

" // The road back for Aren , 27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even harder . Yet there are signs of hope . Nine months after the bombing , Aren , who had been raising Baylee as a single mother ( and who has not disclosed the identity of Baylee 's father ) , met Stan Kok , an Air Force communications specialist . " I fell in love with Stan because he treated Baylee just as I do , " she says . " From the start , he would bring little gifts for her and visit the grave with me . " She and Kok , 29 , were married in April 1997 . They now have a daughter Bell , 2 , who bears a striking resemblance to her half sister Baylee , and are expecting another child in December . Though until recently Aren could not bear to look at the picture of her dead child- " If I had my way , I 'd take all the negatives and burn them , " she says-she recently helped launch the Protecting People First Foundation , which will use a version of the photo as its official logo . The foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public buildings as a precaution against man-made and natural disasters . " Using the picture this way turns it into something that symbolizes safety and not tragedy , " she says . But her heart has never fully healed-and perhaps it will not . " I do n't find closure , " says Aren . " I never forget . " In fact , she adds , " I talk to Baylee even today . She is as alive to me as she ever was . Several times a day I tell her I love hey and there is not a night that I do n't tell her good night before I go to sleep . " With a Child , Hope Is Reborn dye Smith 's anguish broke America 's heart . Even now , five years later few will have forgotten the sight of the grief-racked young mother with her ex-husband , Tony Smith , as they sat beside the single white casket containing the bodies of their two little boys , Chase , 3 , and Colton , 2 , laid together for eternity . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Smith , 28 , of the man she had divorced four months before the bombing that claimed the lives of their sons . " I thought we 'd be together a little longer and try to help each other through it . " What happened instead was that , hoping perhaps to replace the irreplaceable , the devastated couple decided to remarry and try to have more children together . But within a month of their September 1995 second wedding , paid for by the National Enquirer , the pair had parted againwithout a pregnancy . Says Smith : " We were thinking with our hearts instead of our heads . " As disappointing as the second breakup was , worse lay ahead . In June 1996 , Smith learned that her beloved stepfather , Glenn Wilburn , was critically ill with pancreatic cancer , which would claim him 13 months later at the age of 46 . " I do n't know which is worse-losing someone in an instant or watching them waste away , " says Smith , who retired from the IRS after the bombing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hairdresser .

" // But then she found love again when she met satellite truck operator Paul Stowe , now 26 , at the Oklahoma State Fair in September 1996 . They married eight months later , and on Jan. 12 , 1998 , Edye gave birth to their son . Named Glenn after her stepfather the chubby-cheeked towhead bears an uncanny resemblance to Colton .

She herself was rescued from the wreckage only after her right leg was amputated to free her . Photograph " I thought I 'd never be a mother again , " says Smith Stowe ( with son Glenn ) . " I 've grown a lot . I feel I have a greater appreciation for life : ' // The ensuing five years have n't helped . Though Bradley , 25 , gave birth to Alize , now 4 , a day shy of the bombing 's first anniversary , her marriage to longtime boyfriend Gabriel Bruce in December 1995 ended bitterly soon after Alize was born .

Allen looks like any 6-year-old , happily coloring in his toyfilled playroom . But the loud whooshing that can be heard throughout the house he shares with his grandmother Deloris Watson serves as a reminder that this is far from the case . The sound is his breathing through the tracheotomy tube in his throat . It was inserted after the searing fire of the Oklahoma City blast-which P.J. was one of only six children at the America 's Kids daycare center to survive-scarred his lungs so severely that he still needs treatments with a medicated mist every four hours . " We are a long ways from where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 48 . " There is massive scar tissue . " Photograph " There 's no room for hatred , " says Deloris Watson ( at home with her grandson PJ . Allen , a blast survivor ) . Photograph " I was praying , " says Watson of her bedside vigil in ' ' 95 . " Praying this little boy would make it . " // The same might be said of Watson 's life . Under the stress of P.J. 's medical problems , her marriage to salesman Willie Watson , now 48 , collapsed , and the pair divorced in February 1999 . Because of P J. 's open trachea and the danger of respiratory infection , he can not attend either school or daycare , and a teacher visits him at home two hours a day " I am his playmate , " says Watson , who lost her job as a technician with Southwestern Bell after the demands of her grandson 's care kept her from returning to work . Although treatment for P.J.

" It has n't been easy , " says Watson , who relies on aid from several charities . " At this point we basically live at the mercy of others . " Still , Watson strives to remain upbeat , focusing on that long-awaited day , perhaps four years down the road , when P.J. 's trach tube will come out and he can finally go to school . " I have nothing to feel sorry for , " she says . " No sacrifice is too much for this child . " Risen from the Ashes , Two Comeback Kids im Denny can chuckle now as he recalls the day he took his battered 2-year-old daughter Rebecca home from the hospital two weeks after the bombing .

Brandon continues to work with a speech pathologist , and there are occasional disturbing reminders of the bombing . During one thunderstorm , Rebecca told Claudia , now a secretary at Tinker Air Force Base , that she did n't want to go in " the bad building " again . Yet the Dennys are counting their blessings .
