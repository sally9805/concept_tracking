Airline business-class sections are being transformed from traditional seating areas to upper-crust slumber parties with seats that turn into beds . More than 20 international carriers have  --  or by the end of the year will have  --  these so-called seat-beds in business class . Twenty-seven have even more luxurious accommodations in first class . The only U.S. carrier to offer a business-class seat-bed , Northwest Airlines , has the kind that lies at an angle , with the foot below the head , rather than perfectly flat . In a recent survey by Skytrax , a British firm that tracks travel trends , only three carriers received the top rating for their business-class seat-beds : South African , Virgin and British Airways .  --  By Sally B.
