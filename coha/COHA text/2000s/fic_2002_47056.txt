When a reviewer for Locus Online listed Mr. Di Filippo as one of the ten best short fiction writers at work today , Paul responded by spoofing the whole list ( including his own work ) . Such is the irreverent nature of his talent . Restless and prodigious it is , too : Paul reports that in addition to his recent story collection Strange Trades , he has no less than five books due out this year : a dark fantasy novel called A Mouthful of Tongues , a novella entitled One Year in the Linear City , a collection of short fiction by the name of Babylon Sisters and Other Posthumans , another novel , Spondulix ( expanded from the novella of the same name ) , and a collection of fantasy stories entitled Little Doors . In recent months , we 've had some unusual narrators in these pages , including a linguistic worm ... but nobody yet has held a candle to the one Paul Di Filippo introduces here : <p> THE HEAD OF THE SPIKE BITES deep into the hard substance of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower part of my anatomy with compulsive , fearful force . The spike supports me , while my body in turn supports the man 's entire weight . He 's a small , dumpy fellow , to be sure , but still the strain on me is considerable . Relying thus on a small piece of rusty hardware for our lives , both of us dangle over five stories of empty space , the cobbled street far below us a rain-slick bumpy surface lit by a few dim streetlights casting golden pools of luminance . My body feels as if it 's going to come apart at any moment . For the first time in this new form I feel true pain . Even the birthing blades , the planes and chisels and sandpaper , and the subsequent daily flames applied to my skin offered no sensations such as this . Oh my goodness , I think wildly , how did I ever come to such a bizarre fate ? And just then the gunshot rings out . My name is Hiram P. Dottle , and once upon a time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensual pleasures of a mild nature . No guns or danger intruded then into my reclusive private sphere . But all of that security and somnolence ended with the arrival of Sparky Flint . But I rush ahead of my story . More of this temptress soon enough . Although not born to great wealth , at the time my tale commences I was living comfortably on a guaranteed income , having retired in early middle age from my career as an accountant . I owed my good fortune to the demise of an elderly and well-off maiden aunt in Crescent City : Denise K. Sinkel , formerly of the Massachusetts Sinkels . Her will left everything to " my nephew , Hiram , the only one who always remembered his lonely old aunt at Christmas . " This statement was accurate , even down to poor Aunt Denise 's famous self-pity . My contribution to Aunt Denise 's good cheer was , I fear , minimal , and offered me as much pleasure as it did her . I always saw to it that Aunt Denise 's house was graced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few poinsettia plants during the holidays . Riding the bus myself from Central City to its urban neighbor , I kept careful watch over the homemade wreaths and personally cultivated plants resting securely in overhead stowage , never relaxing my vigilance until the cabbie deposited me safely at Aunt Denise 's . Horticulture and flower arranging , you see , were my hobbies . You 'd probably never guess it from looking at me , but accounting was never my real love , merely a safe and reliable means of earning my income . Mother and Father both insisted that I turn my adult hand to some low-risk mode of employment promising a small if steady return . So I reluctantly discarded my typical childhood fascination with such icons of daring exploration as Lowell Thomas , Frank Buck and Richard Halliburton why , today I can hardly believe the youthful dreams I had , involving travel to exotic climes and battle with wild animals and savage natives ! - and when I reached my early maturity I enrolled at Keating 's School of Accountancy . Thirty years later Mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral home where I still occupied my boyhood room . The property consisted of a well-kept but fading Victorian manse set on five acres of land in a neighborhood rather fallen , if you 'll permit the pun , to seed . This surprising legacy descended on an asocial bachelor who in the morning mirror seemed undressed without his green celluloid eyeshade and sleeve garters . Having perused enough ledgers and balance sheets to build a tower to the Moon - had I cared to indulge in such fanciful behavior - I was more than ready to put my career behind and plunge more deeply into my passions . The redeeming moments in what I confess most people would categorize as a boring life occurred in my garden . In the suburbs of Central City , my property , through diligent and loving application , had been ultimately turned into a miniature Versailles , replete with espaliers , pollarded aisles and substantial fountains . I venture to say that not even the immaculately landscaped grounds of Idlewhile Cemetery ( I am naturally excluding that spooky and mysteriously overgrown portion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my land . Why , the neighborhood children , dirty urchins all , frequently congregated at my fence to gape in awe . At least I assumed their emotions were respectful , although several times I thought to detect an out-thrust tongue swiftly withdrawn when I turned to face them . No matter , though , for I was content . After Aunt Denise 's independence-granting demise , I enjoyed four whole luxurious years of complete devotion to gardening . My joyful days were filled with propagating and reporting , grafting and staking , doubledigging and turf-laying . I managed the funds that had so unexpectedly become mine with care and wisdom , investing them in U.S. Treasury Bonds at a solid one-and-a-half percent annual return . Combined with my own personal savings , this interest income satisfied all my simple needs . Although I admit I did once boldly dip into some of the capital to secure a new wheelbarrow , a toolshed , and some fine handwrought British tools . Including , in a magnificent example of life 's irony , the well-honed axe that killed me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climacteric occurred in my life shortly after my inheritance . That deadly turning point consisted of my meeting the irresistible Sparky Flint . I ca n't say now what came over me that fatal night . Some Imp of the Perverse took hold of my lapels and whispered evil urgings into my ear . To be short about it , I developed an instant but avid craving for a spot of sherry . Aunt Denise had always treated me to a small annual glass of sherry upon completion of my decorating her house . After ten years of the ritual I grew accustomed to the taste , and actually came to look forward to the uncommon indulgence . Now , four years without tasting a drop of sherry and my quiescent desires suddenly came to a head . I felt an unquenchable thirst that only strong drink could satisfy . So I set out with grim determination for a saloon . The trolley dropped me off downtown . Walking the unfamiliar nighted streets of Central City , I tried to gauge which establishment might prove most suitable for a gentleman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ended up entering a most ungenteel " dive . " The " joint " was packed with smoking , sweating , cursing , laughing humanity , their voices echoing off the garish walls and grimy ceiling . I felt like a frightened cow amidst his ignorant bovine peers on the abattoir walkway . Nonetheless my unnatural compulsions for the fruit of the vine still held sway . I worked my way toward the bar , past lap-seated trollops hoisting foamy mugs of beer to their lips and brawny laborers knocking back " boilermakers . " At the bar I secured my drink , enduring a sneer or two at my uncommon choice of beverage from my immediate neighbors and even from the bartender himself , an ugly bruiser . I rested one foot on the brass rail , in imitation of my fellow imbibers , but the stance felt too unsteady , and I moved off to a small empty table . And then the singing began . Supernal , sirenical singing like nothing I had ever heard before , as if hundreds of calla lilies had suddenly taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angelic female voice might have been termed " torchsong . " If so , the metaphor was apt , since my whole soul was enflamed by the unseen songstress . No doubt the alcohol coursing wildly through my veins played its part as well . I stood up instinctively in an attempt to spot the singer and was rewarded by sight of a small , lighted stage . And there she stood , microphone in hand . Sparky Flint . Her hair a tumbling mass of poppy-red curls , her cosmetic-enhanced face brazenly sensuous , her Junoesque figure wrapped in a tight jade evening dress , the singer caressed each syllable of her lustful song in a way that delivered the words like vernal osmosis straight to my heart . I remained standing for the exotic chanteuses entire hypnotic performance , learning her name only when a coarse emcee ushered her off the stage . Collapsing back into my seat , I downed the remaining inch of my sherry in one dynamic swallow . And as I set the glass down , my eyes confronted the satin-swaddled bosom of Sparky Flint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey ? " " Nuh-no , nuh-not at all . " She took up her seat so closely to mine that our knees almost touched , and I could see the very weave of her silk stockings where they caressed her ankle above the strap of her shoe . Conquering the reek of spilled ale and tobacco and human musk , a whiff of her sharp synthetic floral scent carried to my nostrils . The barroom seemed to spin in circles about me . " Care to buy a girl a drink , sport ? " " I - that is - why , certainly . " I tried to adopt a dapper manner . " I fear I must have misplaced my manners in my other suit . " I summoned a barmaid and Sparky ordered a cocktail unfamiliar to me . Once she had refreshed her tired vocal cords , she fixed me with an inquisitive yet friendly stare . " I never had no guy stand up tor my whole show before . Most of these bums would n't know if the management had a hyena cackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? " " Why , yes , most assuredly . Such dulcet yet thrilling tones have never before laved my ears . " Sparky drained her drink and began toying with a toothpick-pierced olive . " You 're a regular charmer , fella . Say , what 's your name ? " " Hiram . Hiram P. Dottle . " " Well , Hiram , let me let you in on a little secret . A lady likes to he appreciated for her talents , you know . She can get mighty friendly with the right guy , if he shows a little gen-u-wine interest . And even though I 've got a swell set of pipes , that ai n't all the assets Sparky Flint 's got hidden . Say , speaking of assets - why doncha tell me a little more about yourself . " I gulped , swallowing some kind of sudden lump big as an iris corm , and began to recount my life history . Sparky brightened considerably when I described my home , and became positively overwrought when I detailed the clever way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was practically sitting in my lap , and I confess that I had indulged in two more glasses of sherry . " Oh , Dottie , you 've led such a fascinating life ! You do n't mind if I call you Dottie , do you ? " No one had ever employed such a diminuitive variant of my name before . But then again , never had I established such a quick bond with any female of the species . " Why , I - " " I thought you 'd be jake with that ! You 're such a broad-minded character . Did anyone ever tell you that your mustache is so attractively wispy , Dottie ? I bet it tickles just like a caterpillar when you kiss . " And then to test her proposition , she planted her lips directly upon mine , in the most thrilling moment of my life , comparable only to my success in breeding a pure-white pansy , a feat written up as a sidebar in Horticulture Monthly . We were married one month later . Only upon securing the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maisie Grumbach , she had been raised in Central City 's orphanage , and possessed no kin of any degree . " A girl on her owns got ta be fast on her feet , Dottie . I learned that early on at the orphanage . When it 's slopping time at the hog trough , the slow piglet goes to bed hungry . The main chance just do n't linger . Grab what you can , when you can - that 's Sparky Flint 's motto . " The first six months of our marriage offered all the connubial and domestic joys imaginable . Sparky lavished her affections on me . If I could blush in my present state I certainly would , to recall how she twisted her " little Dottie-wottie " around her slim fingers , with honeyed words and lascivious attentions . And all the while , behind her facade of love lurked the heartless viper of greed and treachery . The first rift in our romance developed when I proposed to spend one thousand dollars to put in an elaborate carp pond . I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoting this amount to my harmless hobby . After all , had n't I given Sparky the elaborate wedding she desired , spending liberally on her gown and jewelry , as well as providing a feast for those few guests we could summon up between us ? ( Sparky 's friends I found rather unsavory , and spent as little time with them as possible . ) " Ten Ben Franklins on a fishing hole ! " shrieked Sparky , abusing her nightingale 's throat most horridly . " And I have n't had a new pair of shoes in a month ! What the hell are you thinking ? Do I look like the kind of dame who prefers sardines to high heels ? " " But Sparky , dear - " " Fuhgeddaboutit ! " Our marital situation deteriorated rapidly from that point on , as if a plug had been pulled on a greasy watertower full of ill feelings that now drained over us . Accusations , vituperations , insinuations - these replaced whispered endearments and fond embraces on Sparky 's part . My share of these increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by contrite agreement . Nevertheless , unplacated , my wife began spending inordinate amounts of time away from home , frequently returning only after I had finished my nine o'clock snack of milk and common crackers and turned out the lights for sleep . The final straw apparently came with a most unwise and unannounced expenditure on my part . I had learned by now not to advertise in advance my horticultural expenditures . Consequently , the delivery of lumber , cast iron fittings and sheets of glass sufficient to construct a charming Edwardian greenhouse took Sparky completely by surprise . She had the tact to wait until the deliverymen left before laying into me , although judging by the mottling of her complexion the restraint had nearly caused her to burst a vein . " What the hell is all this , buster ! Are you out of your everlovin " mind ? Your wife is walking around in rags , and you 're blowing through my inheritance like a dipso through free muscatel ! " I tried to divert her anger by joshing . " Oh , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband not much older than you yourself . Surely it 's premature to be speaking of my unlikely demise and your grieving widowhood . " A look of pure vicious hatred such as I had never before seen on a human visage passed fleetingly across Sparky 's beautiful features , to be replaced by a composed mask of indifference . " Oh , too early is it ? Maybe - and maybe not .... " Her words and expression alarmed me to such a degree that I shrugged quickly into my ratty old puttering-about cardigan , murmured something about attending to a fungus problem , and hastened outside . Kneeling at the base of a large , mistletoe-festooned oak tree , I was delicately aerating the soil around its roots with a small tool when I heard someone approaching . I looked over my shoulder and saw a horrifying sight . My loving wife Sparky , hoisting high my fine British axe in her gloved hands . Struck mute , paralyzed , I could only listen helplessly to her insane rehearsal of some future speech for an unknown audience . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've noticed tramps and vagrants and petty thieves lurking around our estate ever since my poor dead husband brought me here as his blushing bride . One of them must have finally broken in . I 'm sure my husband died defending my virtue . " " No , Sparky , no ! " I finally managed to croak . Too late , for the axe was already descending . In my fading eyesight , filled totally with a closeup landscape of bark , I watched my own blood jet and pool in a hollow formed by two intersecting oak roots . Then all went black . THE ASTONISHING RETURN of my con sciousness at first brought with it no sensory data , aside from a sense of well-being and wholeness . For an indefinite leisurely time I basked in the simple absence of the shattering pain that had accompanied Sparky 's treacherous assault . The utter blackness and lack of sound in my current environment failed to frighten me . I felt too much at ease , too peaceful . I could only conclude that some good Samaritan had rescued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , and that now I rested in a cozy hospital bed , guarded by watchful nurses and doctors , my eyes and ears bandaged , my healing body suffused with morphine . The closest I approached to worrying about my old life was a vague feeling that certainly some drastic changes would have to be engineered in my spousal relations , once I fully recovered . Perhaps even a trial separation . Then , after this period of idle , happy musing , odd , subliminal sensations began to filter into my consciousness . I seemed to register light striking me , but in a new fashion . Sunlight seemed to be impinging upon my " skin " and " face " in a whole-body manner , as if I were - horrors ! utterly unclothed at the beach . Discordant , jagged images swept over me . Likewise , I perceived the ambient soundscape in a novel , jumbled manner . Oddest of all though were fresh tactile impressions . I experienced a contradictory feeling of compression and extension , as if I were stuffed into a closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my sense of time 's passage had altered . Objective minutes , gauged by the fragmentary movements of the sun , seemed to drip by like hours . I used this extended realm of time wisely , and by the end of what must have been a single day , I had thoroughly integrated my new senses so that I could see and hear and feel in a coherent way . From my new immovable vantage I enjoyed a three-hundred-andsixty degree omniscient view of some very familiar landscaped grounds . And when I focused my " sight " in one particular direction , I saw my ancestral home standing forlorn and dark . Triangulating my position by landmarks , I could no longer deny the obvious conclusion . My soul now inhabited the very oak tree at whose foot I had been slaughtered . I was now a male dryad , if such a creature were possible . Acknowledging this impossible truth , I directed my vision and other senses downward . My human body had been carted away , but my sticky blood still filled the hollow where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oakish satisfaction at this extra-rich watering , as if grateful for my pagan due . Apparently , the original spirit of the oak still to some degree overlapped mine , offering its old perceptions . Well , this was a fine fix , I thought . My old life had reached a premature conclusion , and such comforting rituals as milk and common crackers availed naught . But questioning the miracle would be futile , and I would simply have to learn to inhabit my new body and enjoy this mode of existence . Surprisingly , the transition came quite easily . By dawn of the next day , approximately forty-eight or seventy-two hours after my murder , I was already happy in my arboreal magnificence . All my nurturing of this tree had prepared a veritable temple for my spirit . My roots stretched deeply down and out into nutritious , stable soil , while my crown of efficient leaves reared high into the welcoming sky . My inner flesh was strong and healthy , my limbs proud and free of disease . Birds and squirrels nested in my niches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my slow engines . Ants crawling up and down me tickled and massaged and warred with insidious insects that would have harmed me . Like some Hindoo holyman , I experienced an absolute contentment with my condition , free of unsatisified desires , my mind at one with ancient cosmic imperatives . But then came a disturbing incident that awoke my human side . Out of my old house stepped Sparky Flint , my murderous wife . And with her was a man ! Tall and impressively muscled , clad in a dark suit and crisp fedora , the fellow strolled alongside Sparky with a sober yet irrepressibly jaunty air . I instantly assessed him as ten times the physical specimen I had ever been ( although of course compared to my current girth and strength he was pitiful ) , and I felt complete jealousy toward this new suitor . But then as the pair approached and I spotted the small mask guarding the stranger 's identity , I recognized him and my feelings flipflopped instantly . This was the Shade ! Central City 's daring crimefighter , champion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avenge my murder ! I focused my " hearing " on Sparky and the Shade , a small matter of forming a parabolic cone with certain of my leaves . " I wish I had returned from my affairs in China a day or two earlier , " said the Shade , " before Klink and his boys completely obliterated this lawn . Look at this mess ! Those flatfoots might 've been playing a duffer 's round of golf , the lawn 's so hacked up . Any clues to the identity of your husband 's killer are long gone . " For the first time I noted the terrible condition of the lawn . What the Shade had observed was true . I regretted I would not be able to roll out and reseed in my current state . Attired in widow 's weeds , a veil floating across her devilishly beautiful features , Sparky sniffled with touching , albeit insincere sympathy . " Poor Dottie ! He was ever so prideful of his whole garden . Sometimes in fact I think he loved it more than me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ... honesty instantly forced me to amend . The Shade regarded Sparky with a natural compassion , tempered , I thought , only by those common suspicions that attach to the spouse of any murdered husband . " There , there , Mrs. Dottle . I know it 's small comfort , but we 'll eventually catch the fiend who did this . " " That 's what I pray for each night before I climb into my lonely empty bed , Mister Shade , where I writhe and squirm feverishly until dawn . " Sparky gripped the Shade 's right bicep in an overfamiliar manner and fluttered her long lashes at him . The Shade appeared a trifle flustered . " Ahem , yes . Now , let me just have a look at this tree . " Crouching at my base , the Shade produced a magnifying lens and examined my bark . With one gloved finger he took up a few flakes of my rain-washed and sun-dried blood . He cogitated a moment , then stood . " I would 've thought a man startled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , or at least clawed at the tree where he kneeled in an attempt to scramble upright . Yet he died without a scuffle right where you earlier saw him working . " Unwisely perhaps , Sparky vented her residual hatred . " Dottie was a meek little shrimp ! " Hastily , she recovered . " That is , my husband had a mild disposition . He must 've fainted straight away when the awful thug came on him . " " Yes , that 's one explanation . Well , Mrs. Dottle , there 's not a lot I can do here . I 'll be going now . " " Oh , please , Mister Shade , just walk me back to the house . I ca n't stand to be alone near this tree . There 's something creepy about it now , since my husband died . " As the Shade and Sparky retreated , she cast a dire look back at me , almost as if she could see her husband sheltering inside his oaken suit . Once the pair were out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The happy sensations of being an oak completely wiped away any mortal cares left over from my prior life . Why should I trouble myself about human justice ? My old life would never be restored through the courts . Let the fleshly ones squabble among themselves . Their little lives had no impact on mine . My arrogant invulnerability lasted for roughly a year . Through summer , fall and winter I gloried undisturbed in the magnificence of my being , experiencing each turning season with new joy . But then in the spring came my comeuppance . I had been much too cavalier in dismissing Sparky 's ability to do me further harm . One day near the anniversary of my murder , a second set of killers arrived to slay me once again . I witnessed the truck from Resneis Arborists pass through the gates of my small estate and down the drive . Improbably and most uncivilly , it actually continued up onto my prize lawn , the turf now looking admittedly less than perfect due to lack of attention . Rough-handed workers tumbled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , you jokers , get a move on ! We 've got to take down every tree on this property plenty pronto , if we want that bonus . And the big oak goes first ! " Horrified , I watched two men pull a huge saw from their truck and start toward me . I could feel the big sharp teeth placed harshly against my barky skin . The first rasping cut produced a dull agony . The second , deeper stroke sent fiery alarm signals down my every fiber . I could feel my consciousness pulling instinctively back from the pain . I had an impulse to gather myself into the deepest core of my being , to escape the torture . But before I lost touch with the outer world , I caught the arrival of Sparky and a brutish-looking stranger dressed in a suit with roguishly wide lapels . I forced myself to focus on their sotto voce dialogue , as they conversed in what they deemed utter secrecy . " I got ta hand it to ya , Sparky baby , " said the thug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot for Central City 's new casino . But ai n't " cha being a bit , well , pre-ma-tour with the choppin , an " the bulldozin " an " all ? The permits an " licenses from City Hall ai n't exactly a shoe-in . Mayor Nolan ai n't too keen on gamblin ' . And her copper daddy will bust a gasket if he learns who your backers are . " " You just leave Commissioner Nolan and his brat in City Hall to me , big boy , and concentrate on what you do best . " " Lovin " and killin ' , right ? " " Right , Jules . " The conniving pair went into a clinch that violated every element of the Hays Code , but I could spare no further attention for their reprehensible licentiousness . Loud creakings and groanings were issuing from my numb nether regions , which either I or the oak had protectively desensitized . With grave misgivings , I noticed that I was beginning to cant and tip . My ultimate downfall followed swiftly . The final fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . The thundering impact was titanic , and I lost consciousness for some time . When I came to , I could feel my proud branches being lopped . In short time I was hoisted by a newly arrived crane onto an accompanying flatbed truck and carted off . Huddling deep inside myself , I realized then that my fate most likely involved a quick trip to the sawmill and a swift transition into planks . But such was not the case . Apparently I was destined for stranger ends . Whether subconsciously or not , Sparky had chosen a fate for my wooden corpse meant to humiliate . Even in death I would be denied utilitarian dignity . When I felt a cessation of motion , I pooled my dwindling organic energies and tried to apprehend my destination . I saw a sign that read CENTRAL CITY SCHOOL OF ART AND DESIGN , and quickly intuited my ignominious lot : to become practice billets for budding , ham-fisted sculptors . The best I could hope for was to grace a tobacco shop as a clumsy wooden Indian . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and , once callously stripped of my bark , rapidly dismembered into several largish sections of trunk . With each cut I pulled my ectoplasmic bits of mental being out of the severed section , retreating and retreating , until finally , with the last slice , I found all my fading identity concentrated in one portion of trunk . For a long time I existed only in a state resembling hibernation , as I cured in a storeroom . What became of my nonsentient bits I can not tell . After an unguessable duration , the portion housing my ghostly self , roused by motion , eventually rode a dolly to the atelier of a youth possessed of handsome Mediterranean looks and clad in leather apron and work gloves . I heard him addressed as " Gino " by the delivery men . Gino wrestled me upright into position on a platform , then stepped back to survey me . " Hmm , I see hidden in this dumb wood a straining heroic figure , fighting against injustice . Perhaps I 'll call this masterpiece " Samson Rages Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's noble goals for my dessicated flesh , I still cringed to imagine the first blow of his chisel . Trying to avoid his blow , I concentrated my essence far away from his anticipated strike . But then , at the last moment , he shifted position and cleaved off that very block of matter containing all my soul ! I fell to the floor , ignored in the white heat of artistic creation . But at day 's end , to my surprise , Gino picked me up and carried me home . The young sculptor lived in an Italian slum on the far side of Central City . Apparently he shared his dismal cold water flat only with his father , a cheerful old fellow with an aura of deep wisdom about him . " Poppa , look , " Gino called out as soon as he entered . " Some raw material for your hobby . " Gino 's father took me in his rough hands . How humiliating I thought . From Hiram P. Dottie , bookkeeper , botanist , and husband , to mighty oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over , examining me with a keen eye before finally speaking . " It's-a not fine Algerian brier , Gino , like-a what-a we had back in Napoli . But the grain , she 's a-fine . Maybe Mario Deodati can make-a one nice pipe out of this scrap . " " Thataboy , Pop ! Go to it ! " Thus began my final metamorphosis , under the magically skilled hands of Mario Deodati . Pared away with patient cunning , the block revealed the shape hiding within it . And amazingly , as Mario lavished attention and craft and even love on me , I felt my identity taking renewed strength . Holding my still-chunky form at one point , Mario spoke to me , his creation : " I see a face in-a you , Mister Pipe . I 'm a-make your bowl into a smiling head . " Good as his word , Mario carved facial features into his creation . I had no mirror to observe myself in , but I could feel from inside that my new visage was perhaps overly jolly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sensitivity as to my true nature extended only so far . One day in late winter , when the winds rattled the loose , rag-stuffed windows in the apartment , Mario and Gino had a terse , painful discussion which I observed and listened to from my perch on a shelf . " It 's no use , Pop . I 'm going to have to quit school . We do n't even have the money for coal and groceries , never mind my tuition . " Mario banged the table with the hand that had birthed me . " Did me and your sainted Momma teach-a you to be a quitter ! You gon na stay in school , boy ! " He struggled to his feet and snatched me down off the shelf . " Go sell this ! And get-a the best price you can ! " Wrapped in an old piece of flannel , I left my latest home . I surmised that it was now nearly a year since I had been felled , and my fate once more loomed obscure . Five stores later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the princely sum of one hundred dollars , enough to keep the Deodatis afloat for several months , and I silently bade farewell to Gino . My new owner was a portly bearded punctilious gentleman in vest and suit . The tip of his tongue protruding absentmindedly from the comer of his compressed lips , he inked a pricetag in the amount of two hundred dollars , tied it to my stem with string , and placed me on a velvet cushion in a display case . That night , when the shop lights clicked off and only stray glints from street lamps illuminated my new home , I tried to communicate somehow with my new neighbors . But they failed to respond to the most vigorous of my psychic efforts , and I realized I was the only sensate pipe amongst them . Internally , I shed a self-pitying tear or two as I contemplated my sad lot . The next few weeks established a boring routine of shop-opening , commercial traffic , shop-closing and a long night of despair . I was handled and admired several times , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of two famous customers . The well-dressed and decorously glamorous woman with her twin rolls of blonde hair pinned high atop her head appeared first in my field of vision . Lowering her half-familiar happy face to the glass separating us , she spoke . " Oh , Shade , look ! Is n't that model with the carved face just darling ? " The masked visage of the Shade manifested next to the woman 's . In context , I recognized her now as Mayor Ellen Nolan . The Shade did not seem to share all of Ellen Nolan 's enthusiasm . His manly features wrinkled in quizzical bemusement . " Gee , Ellen , I 've seen better mugs on plug-uglies from the Gasworks Gang ! And two hundred dollars ! Do you realize how many orphans we could feed with that money ? " " Do n't be such a wet blanket , Shade . Spending a little extra of my personal money on Daddy 's birthday wo n't send any orphans to bed hungry . " The Shade lifted his hat and skritched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , Ellen ? How are you going to get Nolan to give up his favorite old stinkpot in favor of this one anyhow ? " " Simple . I 'll hide it . " A whistle of admiration escaped the Shade 's lips . " And the newspapers say I 've got guts ! Well , I leave it all up to you . " " A wise decision . Sir , we 'll take this one . And wrap it nicely , please . " Into a dark box I went . The crinkle of folding giftpaper and the zip of cellotape from a dispenser was followed by careful placement into what I presume was a handled shopping bag . I guessed by the long stride I subsequently shared that the Shade next carried me home to Ellen 's house . I heard the smack of a kiss upon a cheek , then felt further lifting movements , ending up , I supposed , hidden in a closet . The routine of the house for the next day or so quickly became aurally familiar . The gruff yet loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , while the perky but forceful Mayor Nolan held to a more regular schedule . The Shade popped up unpredictably . Finally one special morning , muffled in my closet I could hear Ellen 's father ranting , turning the air blue with his curses . " Where could that dangblasted , consarned pipe of mine have gotten to ! Ellen ! Ellen ! ELLEN ! " " Yes , Daddy , whatever 's the matter ? " " My favorite pipe ! I ca n't find it ! I 'm certain I left it on the bedstand when I went to sleep , but now it 's missing ! How can I go to work without it ? " Footsteps approached me , a door creaked open , and I was lifted down in my package . Ellen 's sweet voice soothed her father . " Well , I have n't the foggiest notion of where you 've mislaid that awful thing . But luckily enough , I have this little gift right here . Happy Birthday , Daddy ! " My wrapping began to rip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me give you a hand , Daddy dear . " The light of day made me metaphysically squint . I found myself face to face with a choleric , jaw-grinding Commissioner Nolan . The three patches of white hair on his otherwise bald head were mussed and flyaway . He scowled at me , and I knew we had not hit it off . " Is this a kid 's bubblepipe ? What am I supposed to pack it with cornsilk ? " Ellen began tenderly to stroke her father 's hair into better order . " Come on now , do n't be a gruff old bear . This pipe has a hundred times more class than your old one . Wo n't you at least try it , please - for me ? " Nolan turned me around so I faced away from him . Then for the first time I felt the curiously intimate sensation of his blunt teeth biting down strongly on my stem . His irritation caused me to waggle furiously up and down almost in time to his thumping , agitated pulse , so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Feels strange , " Nolan said . " Not like my old one . " " New things take some getting used to . Here 's your tobacco pouch . Smoke up a bowl or two and you 'll see how lovely it is . " Nolan stuffed my wooden head full of pungent weed , tamping the plug down with a blunt , nicotine-stained thumb . Then I heard a match scrape and felt the small flame singe my crown . The pain was less than if I had tested my human flesh with a match , and I resolved to be stoic in my new role . Puffing furiously , Nolan seemed to relax a trifle . " Draws well enough , " he cautiously admitted . " But that simpering little face on the bowl " Shush now ! Off to work with you ! " Nolan snatched up a battered old leather satchel and exited . A police car and driver awaited him outside , and we set off . Well , I can not begin to describe the tremendous excitement of the subsequent several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shade and Nolan in a way no one else ever had , not even the Shade 's loyal Negro sidekick , Busta ! Never absent from Nolan 's pitbull-like mandibular embrace , I found myself swept up in innumerable thrilling confrontations with the forces of evil . Shootouts , chases , last-minute rescues ! Threats , torture , mysterious clues , exotic locales ! Villains , henchmen , mad scientists , femmes fatales ! Why , once I remember we slipped quietly through the slimy , drip-plopping sewers on the trail of the Crustacean , only to discover the archfiend in his lair with But I ramble . I 'll never reach the end of my personal tale if I recount all the wild adventures I experienced . Suffice it to say that out of my three existences to date , being Commissioner Nolan 's trusty pipe proved by far the most invigorating ! Of course , I had to endure many boring meetings as well . Politics played a part in crimefighting , as it did in everything connected with the civic life of Central City . Whenever one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absentminded reverie . I confess to being in one such fugue at the start of that fatal evening . The clock in the Mayor 's shadowy office struck midnight when the Shade and Ellen walked in , causing my owner to hastily remove his feet from his daughter 's desk and leap up from her ornate office chair . The Shade looked shamefaced . " Sorry we 're late . I thought I spotted the wily spy Pola Fleece down by the docks , but it turned out to be only a fashion magazine shoot . It took a while to settle up damages with the photographer and models . Are those slimy business partners here yet ? " Nolan knocked my head on the edge of a trashcan to remove my dead embers , then restuffed me with shag and lit up . I was quite used to the flickering flame by now , and paid it no mind as Nolan began to puff furiously . " Not yet . I do n't like this , Shade - not one little bit . " Ellen chimed in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a cold-blooded witch ! Only a few months until the second anniversary of her husband 's murder , and she 's already taking up with another man . Why , I hear she 's even carrying his lovechild ! " Ellen blushed charmingly at this remark , and the Shade coughed as if he had swallowed a fly . Sparky ? Were they speaking of Sparky ? A old twinge of mixed affection and hatred passed through my wooden frame , and I woke into greater alertness . " And she has n't snagged just any beau , " the Shade added . " Jules The Fife " Reefer has a history of misdeeds as long and bloody as the Carnivore 's . " Nolan said , " Still , we 've never been able to pin anything on him , and this request of theirs to build a casino seems on the up and up . " " I agree they 're following legitimate channels , " said the Shade , " but the big question remains . Do we want to let Reefer construct such an efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course not , " Ellen said . " But we 've stalled them in every legal way we can . There 's no way we can avoid giving them the permits for their casino any longer . " The Shade pushed his hat back on his head and smiled . " That 's the purpose of tonight 's meeting . We 've gotten them so frustrated that they 're bound to offer you a bribe . Why else would they schedule such a late-night get-together ? I 'll be in the next office with the door ajar . Once the money is out in the open , I 'll bust in and put the cuffs on them . End of story . " Nolan scowled . " I suppose it 's the only way . But I do n't like putting Ellen at risk . " Ellen straightened up proudly . " I 'm the Mayor , Daddy . Do n't I deserve my share of the bribe ? In fact , I think you and I will have to split it seventy-thirty . " " Hmph ! Sixty-forty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . " Outside in the empty City Hall corridor the elevator bell chimed , signaling the conveyance 's arrival on our floor . The Shade darted for the connecting door . " Stations , men ! " A few seconds later , my ex-wife and her new lover walked in . Clutching her purse demurely , Sparky looked more desirable than ever , with her tumbling Titian curls framing her adorable face . Recalling Ellen 's catty gossip , I thought to detect a slight swelling of her tummy , heralding the bastard child , substitute for the offspring we had never managed to conceive between us . I felt myself falling in love all over with her again - until I recalled with a shock the murderously contorted lines of this same visage as she swung the axe at my back . Her companion - the identical thuggish man I had seen her with while still a tree - I paid little attention to , deeming him beneath my mature consideration . Besides , it was hard to consider myself his vigorous rival while wearing the semblance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amusement park . " Howdy , Mayor , Commissioner ! Hope we ai n't kept you up past your bedtime . But the deal we got in mind needs a little privacy , heh-heh , if you get my drift . " Sparky kicked Reefer 's ankle and took over the pitch , her dulcet voice achingly familiar . " What my partner means is that we intend tonight to have an end to all delays . Twelve months of red tape have left us feeling very antsy . If there 's any way we can , um , grease the wheels of progress , we are quite willing to - " " Just spit it out , baby . We 're ready to lay some serious mazuma down to get this project underway . Whatta we talkin ' ? Ten thousand ? Fifteen thousand ? " I quivered menacingly between Nolan 's choppers . If only Sparky and Reefer had been able to read the language of my jiggling , they would have turned tail and run . But they were blind to Nolan 's rage . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The mobster reached into his suitcoat 's inner pocket and hauled out a sheaf of bills weighty as one of my prize cabbages . All eyes except mine were magnetized by the bundle of large denomination bills . Thus only I witnessed the Shade sneak catfootedly up behind Reefer and tap him on the shoulder . " Jig 's up , Reefer . Will you come quietly , or do I have to use force ? " Everyone had forgotten Sparky . Until they heard in the stunned silence the click of the hammer on her .45 , loud as my former oaken body crashing to the ground . Sparky 's eyes were hard as her stage name , her face taut with rage . " Jules ai n't going nowhere . It 's you three that are gon na take a little trip . " Even Reefer seemed stunned by his paramour 's steely determination . " Put the rod away , baby . We can beat a little bribery rap . It 's just their word against ours . " Sparky swung her gun toward the Shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got less spine than that mousy dirtgrubber I married ! Win a case against the Shade ? Are you crazy ? He 's got this town sewed up ! " " It 's simply a matter of being on the correct side of the law , Miss Flint . Now if you 'll just do as your boyfriend advises " Shut up , you ! Now , head for the staircase ! " The trio of captives shuffled out-under two guns now - while I was still fuming over the insult Sparky had paid my memory . Once in the stairwell we climbed steadily upward , emerging onto the roof . The summer sky hosted an infinity of stars , as likely to offer us useful help as anyone else in the city . " Go over near the edge , " Sparky commanded . " There 's gon na be a little accident here tonight . Three clumsy stargazers are gon na take a little dive . Maybe the papers will even figure the Shade was somehow responsible . When our crew takes over City Hall , we wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the low parapet protecting us from five stories of oblivion . I could see the Shade tensing his muscles for a lunge . But Sparky anticipated just such an action . " Jules , grab the girl . " Once in Reefer 's clutches , Ellen suffered the muzzle of the pistol jammed against her stomach . " Try anything funny , and your girlfriend gets gutshot . It 's not as easy a death as a broken neck , believe me . " With surprising acrobatic ease , the lumpy Nolan jumped atop the parapet . " Do n't shoot her , Flint . I 'm going first . " And with that he jumped , taking me of course with him . Nolan 's blunt fingers gripped the ledge and interrupted our fall . I deduced his plan : to lure Sparky and Reefer over for a look , then make a surprising grab at them with one hand , thus breaking the stalemate . But even in the dim light Sparky must have seen his efforts . " Reefer , he 's holding on ! Turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I witnessed Reefer above us hefting his own gun , reversed . He smashed the butt down . Nolan grunted , fell a foot with uselessly waving arms - and that was when the protruding spike intercepted my bowl . Nolan 's teeth bit into my stem like a crocodile 's . Reefer called out , " He 's hanging on by his damn pipe ! " " Shoot the pipe out of his mouth then ! " Reefer took careful aim AND JUST THEN the gunshot rings out , simultaneously with the sound of a scuffle on the rooftop , the thud of fists on flesh , of muffled grunts and screams . The bullet pierces my stem , severing it completely . The pain of my mortal wound wracks me with titanic agonies . I try to hold onto consciousness , but feel it ebbing swiftly . But in my last seconds of full awareness , even as my two halves tumble into the void , I thankfully witness the Shade lunge three-quarters over the edge of the parapet to grab Nolan by his wrist . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my soul is not completely extinguished . Although split in two , my human essence remains connected by a dormant thread of ectoplasm . Patiently , able to do nothing else , I await the reinvigorating reunion of my halves , a repair Iam somehow confident will arrive in due course . At last the blessed event comes . Jagged lower stem intersects with upper fragment and bowl , firmly secured with a spot of Elmer 's glue . Although certainly unfit to be smoked , I can still exercise thought and perception . I find myself stapled to a plaque , hanging on a wall beneath an odd circular skylight . Weirdly , the view through the cross-barred aperture reveals not mere sky , but an eerie righted landscape of canted tombstones . I am underground ! And where else but in the Shade 's fabled but neverpinpointed sanctum , its location now disclosed to me alone as the haunted corner of Idlewhile Cemetery ! The Shade himself steps back from hanging me up on his trophy wall . Beside him stands the short , lumpish , wide-eyed figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shade and drives him about Central City in his yellow cab . " Well , Busta , " confides the Shade , " yet another relic of a case wellsolved . Not only did we jail Sparky Flint and Jules Reefer for bribery and multiple attempts at homicide , but , thanks to her confession , we cleared up the old murder of her husband , poor chap . " The Shade pats me affectionately . " Unfortunately , Dottie had no lucky talisman such as this pipe to save him , in the manner it saved Nolan . " The Shade turns to a set of blueprints spread out on a table . " But enough of past glories , Busta . Let 's direct our attention to this diagram of Fort Knox . I expect the Gasworks Gang will strike next month , during the annual ingot-dusting- " Safe , protected from the elements , privileged to share a vicarious life of crime-fighting , I settle cozily down on the wall to listen to the Shade 's brave scheming . There are worse fates for a broken pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
