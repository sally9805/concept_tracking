Six years ago , Luz Cuevas heard an explosion upstairs in her house and ran into her 10-day-old daughter 's bedroom . The baby had vanished . Cuevas looked up and noticed the window was open , which struck her as odd on a cold winter night . Before she could make sense of the empty crib , she noticed a small fire that quickly engulfed the whole bedroom . Investigators determined that it swallowed the remains of the infant as well . <P> Cuevas never believed it had . But how does a mother convince her relatives that she 's right when all they can hear is her grief ? " We thought she was just traumatized by the fire , " says her brother Evaristo de Jesus . And why , six years later , did a Pennsylvania politician and then the police decide to take this mother 's instinct seriously ? " I must admit , when Luz first came to me with this story , I had trouble believing her , " says Angel Cruz , the Pennsylvania state representative who relayed Cuevas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that second-guessing is n't such a bad thing . " <P> Cuevas ' tale was bizarre , which makes this investigation that followed especially surprising ; she never wavered from her conviction that her baby had been taken before the blaze , and then she came back with fresh evidence that the girl she named Delimar Vera was alive . The 6year-old was found across the Delaware River in Willingboro , N.J. , 15 miles from Cuevas ' Philadelphia home . Carolyn Correa , 42 , a distant cousin of Cuevas ' then boyfriend , Pedro Vera , was charged with kidnapping the child and setting a fire to cover her tracks . <P> Cuevas and Correa both belonged to a large circle of family and friends who live near Philadelphia 's gritty Kensington neighborhood . On Jan. 24 , 2004 , Cuevas , Correa and a girl Correa claimed was her daughter , Aaliyah Hernandez , were together at a birthday party that Evelyn Vera , Pedro 's sister , was throwing for her granddaughter . Cuevas says Evelyn brought Aaliyah over to her and said , " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This out-of-the-blue comment deepened suspicions Cuevas had always had about Correa 's role in the disappearance of her baby ; Correa was at the house at the time of the fire , while Pedro was out grocery shopping . So Cuevas looked closely at the little girl 's face . " Those dimples were all the DNA I needed , " says the 31-year-old . But after years of watching Cops on TV , Cuevas knew dimples were n't evidence : she followed Aaliyah upstairs , said , " Sweetheart , you 've got some gum in your hair , " and ripped five strands of hair off her scalp . Aaliyah yelped but did n't cry . Cuevas put the hairs in a ziplock bag . By the end of February , the police had matched the little girl 's DNA to Cuevas ' and Pedro 's . <P> Correa turned herself in last Tuesday and was arraigned on charges that included kidnapping , arson and conspiracy . A judge set bail at $1 million ; Correa 's lawyer says he is considering an insanity defense . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their investigation will continue . Meanwhile , some of Correa 's relatives are denying they knew anything about the alleged abduction . Evelyn Vera says she never uttered the " she 's not your baby " line . " They 're just throwing out lies , " she says . " What am I going to get out of saying that ? Does it make any sense ? "
