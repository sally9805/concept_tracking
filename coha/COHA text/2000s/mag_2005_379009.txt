As a graduate student at the University of Southern California in the mid-1980s , the CEO of China 's third largest oil company remembers seeing Union 76 signs plastered all along America 's Left Coast  --  emblems of California 's car-crazed lifestyle . For Fu Chengyu , then a poor student from northern China , culture shock does n't even begin to describe it . Try future shock . " Back then , " he says , " China seemed like it was 100 years behind the United States . " <P> It is making up for lost time quickly . Never has China 's rapid rise been more evident than last week , when two big Chinese companies entered the auctions for two high-profile U.S. competitors : Haier , well known among college students as the maker of small refrigerators popular in dorm rooms , is teaming with a U.S. private-equity firm to bid for Maytag , the struggling appliance maker based in Iowa . And 19 years after getting his M.A. in petroleum engineering from U.S.C. , Fu wants to own Unocal , once the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , China National Offshore Oil Corp . ( CNOOC ) , topped a $16.5 billion bid from Chevron for the ninth largest U.S. oil company . <P> In China , with its surging trade surplus and huge holdings of dollar reserves , CNOOC 's action is called the " go out " strategy : for the past two years , the Beijing government has been urging Chinese firms to expand their presence in overseas markets . Some have begun to respond . Late last year computer giant Lenovo bought the high-profile but money-losing personal-computer business from IBM for $1.75 billion . Prior to that , TCL , a consumer-electronics maker , bought the RCA TV business from French giant Thomson . And all the while , Chinese energy companies have been making deals with governments and private companies , desperately trying to acquire oil-and-gas reserves needed to power an economy still growing 9% annually . <P> But the bid for Unocal is by far the most audacious move any Chinese company has made . CNOOC , whose market value is only about $22 billion ( compared with $119 billion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share , for Unocal . Since it 's an all-cash offer , the Chinese company would have to take on a huge chunk of debt to finance the deal . Fu insists that no one in the government pushed the company to buy Unocal , and sources close to CNOOC 's board tell TIME that Fu , not some shadowy string-pulling figure in Beijing , has been the driving force behind the bid . Indeed , a banker close to the deal says that Fu is convinced the value of Unocal is actually " much higher " than what his company is offering for it ( attention Unocal shareholders ! ) and that if Chevron counters , CNOOC might not be shy about raising its bid . " If you know our history , " Fu told analysts last week , " you 'll know we are a value-driven company . Value creation drives our acquisition strategy , nothing else . "
