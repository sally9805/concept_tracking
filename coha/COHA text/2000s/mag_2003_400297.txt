STORY My kid 's dog died . Sparky . I hated that dog . The feeling was mutual . We got off on the wrong foot . Whining in his pen those first nights . My squirt gun in his face and him blinking from the water . And then the holes in the yard . The so-called accidents in the house . His nose snuffling into my Brooks Brothers trousers . Him slurping my fine Pilsner beer or sneaking bites of my Dagwood sandwich when I fell asleep on the sofa . Also his inability to fetch , to take a joke , to find the humor in sudden air horns . To be dandled , roughhoused , or teased . And then the growling , the skulking , the snapping at my ankles , the hiding from me under the house , and literally thousands of abject refusals to obey . Like , Who the hell are you ? You 'd have thought he was a cat . When pushed to the brink I shouted , " I 'll cut your face off and show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . Photograph // But with the kids or my wife little Foo-Foo was a changeling , conning them with the tail , the prance , the peppiness , the soft chocolate eyes , the sloppy expressions of love , the easy tricks that if I performed I 'd get no credit for . Oh , we understood each other all right . I was on to him . And then , at age ten , and none too soon , he kicked the bucket . You 'd think that would be it . End of story . But no , he had to get even . Those who have tears , prepare to shed them . I was futzing with the hinges on the front-yard gate on a Saturday afternoon , my tattersall shirtsleeves rolled up and mind off in Oklahoma , when I noticed Fido in the California shade , snoozing , but for once a little wistful too , and far more serene than he usually was in my offensive presence . I tried to surprise him with my standard patriarchal shout , but it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy with my wing tip . Nothing doing . And not so much as a flutter in his oddly abstracted face . Surely this was the big sleep , I thought . She who must be obeyed was at the mall , provisioning , so I was safe from objection or inquiry on that account . I then made an inventory of my progeny : Buzz in the collegiate east , in the realm of heart-attack tuitions , Zack in the netherworld of the surf shop , Suze , my last kid , on her bike and somewhere with her cousin . Were I to bury Rover with due haste and dispatch I could forestall the waterworks , even convince them that he 'd signed up with the circus , run afoul of Cruella DeVille - anything but died . I got a green tarpaulin from the garage and laid it out on the front lawn where I hesitated before using my shoe to roll Spot into his funeral shroud , then dragged him back into the victory garden where summer 's dying zucchini plants were in riot . With trusty spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tamped it down with satisfying whumps . I was feeling good about myself , heroic , as if , miraculously , compassion and charity had invaded not only my bones but my soft-muscle tissues . I fixed myself a tall glass of gin and tonic and watched the first quarter of the USC football game . ( I shall let pass without notice my unheralded career as a linebacker for the Trojans no more than thirty years ago . ) And then pangs of conscience assailed me . Had n't my investigation of said demise of Precious been rather cursory ? Would n't I , myself , closely cross-examine a suspect whose emotions were clouded , whose nefarious wishes were well established , whose veterinary skills were without credential ? The innocence of my childhood had been spoiled with the tales of Edgar Allan Poe , so it was not difficult to conjure images of Scruffy clawing through tarpaulin and earth as he fought for one last gasp of air , air that others could more profitably use . I marched out to the garden with aforementioned spade and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , he seemed none the worse for wear , but I did detect a marked disinclination to respirate , which I took as a sign either of his inveterate stubbornness or of his having reached the Stygian shore . The latter seemed more likely . I heard in my fuddled head a line from The Wild Bunch when a critically injured gunman begs his outlaw gang to " Finish it . " And in the healing spirit of Hippocrates I lifted high the shovel and whanged it down on Harvey 's head . To my relief , not a whimper issued from him . I was confident he was defunct . With care I shrouded and buried him again , committing earth to earth and dust to dust and so on , and with spritelike step conveyed myself to the kitchen where I made another gin and tonic and , in semiprone position , settled into the game 's third quarter , the fabled Trojan running attack grinding out , it would seem , another win . I was shocked awake by the impertinence of a ringing telephone , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife 's friend Vicki inquiring about the pooch , for it was her assertion that Snip had fancied a taste of her son 's upper calf and without invitation or permission to do so had partaken of same within the last twenty-four hours . Even while I was wondering what toxicity lurked in the child 's leg and to what extent the poison was culpably responsible for our adored pet 's actionable extinction , a loss we would feel for our lifetimes , Vicki insisted that I have the dog checked out by a vet to ascertain if he had rabies . Cause of death : rabies ? It seemed unlikely . Notwithstanding his surliness , there 'd been no Cujoesque frothing or lunging at car windows ; but my familiarity with torts of all sorts has made me both careful and rather unctuous in confrontation with a plaintiff , and so I assured the complainant that I would accede to her request . Off to the back yard again , my pace that of a woebegone trudge , and with my implement of agriculture I displaced the slack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusatory tone I said , " You 're doing this on purpose , are n't you , " and I took his silence as a plea of nolo contendere . My plan , of course , was to employ the Oldsmobile 88 to transport my burden to the canine 's autopsy at Dr. Kathy 's office just a half mile away . However , upon settling into its plush front seat , it came to my attention that Zack-he who is but a sojourner on this earth-had not thought to replenish the fuel he 'd used up on his trip to the Hollywood Bowl on the previous night . The vehicle was not in a condition of plenitude . Would not ferry us farther than a block . With Buster lying in the altogether on the driveway , not yet unsightly but no calendar page , I went into the house and found an old leather suitcase in the attic , then stuffed the mutt into the larger flapped compartment before hefting him on his final journey to those veterinary rooms he always shivered in . I am , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nearly Olympian strength , but I found myself hauling my heavy and lifeless cargo to Dr. Kathy 's with a pronounced lack of vigor and resolve . The September afternoon was hot , the Pasadena streets were vacant , the entire world seemed to have found entertainment and surcease in ways that I had not . I was , in a word , in a sweaty snit , and after many panting and pain-filled stops , my spine in Quasimodo configuration and my right arm gradually inching longer than my left , it was all I could do not to heave the suitcase containing Wonderdog into a haulaway behind the Chinese restaurant . But during our joint ordeal I had developed a grudging affection for our pet ; he who 'd been so quick to defend my kith and kin against the noise of passing trucks , who took loud notice of the squirrels outside , who held fast in the foyer , hackles raised , fearlessly barking , whenever company arrived at the front door . With him I seemed calm , masterful , and uneccentric , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without him , I thought , I would be otherwise . I put down the suitcase to shake the ache from my fingers and subtract affliction from my back , and it was then that my final indignity came . An angel of mercy spied my plight , braked his ancient Cadillac , and got out , his facial piercings and tattoos and shoot-the-marbles eyes belying the kindness and decency of his heart as he asked , " Can I help you with that suitcase ? " " I can handle it . " " Are you sure ? " " I 'm just two blocks away . " " What the heck 's in it ? " he asked . And for some reason I said , " A family heirloom . " " Wow ! " he said . " Why do n't you put it in my trunk and I 'll help you with it ? I got nothin ' better to do . " Well , I did not just fall off the turnip truck . I would have been , in other circumstances , suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worthlessness of my cumbrance , and so I granted his specified offer , hoisting the deceased into the Seville and slamming down the trunk lid . And , in evidence of our fallen state , my Samaritan immediately took off without me , hooting and peeling rubber and speeding west toward Los Angeles . I could only lift my hand in a languid wave . So long , old sport . Our world being the location of penance and recrimination , it was only right that my last kid should pedal up to me on her bike just then and ask , " Daddy , what are you doing here ? " Waving to a guy , I thought , who 's apt to be rather surprised soon . And then I confessed . Spot 's sudden death , the burial , not the exhumation and execution attempt , but the imputation of rabies and my arduous efforts to acquit his reputation with a pilgrimage to the vet 's . Suze took it in with sangfroid for a little while , but then the lip quivered and tears spilled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she begged me to get her another dog just like Sparky . And that was Sparky 's final revenge , for I said , " Okay , honey . Another dog , just like him . " Author Affiliation Ron Hansen 's most recent novel is Is n't It Romantic ? ( HarperCollins ) .
