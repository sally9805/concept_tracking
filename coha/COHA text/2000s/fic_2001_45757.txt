Between jaunts to Rome and parts unknown , Mr. Bell reports from his Salt Lake City home that seventeen of his stories have just been published in an eBook with the title of How We Play the Game in Salt Lake , and Other Stories . Said volume will include a couple of his previous contributions to our pages , such as " With Rain , and a Dog Barking " and " Bright New Skies . " His latest story is a tale of timeless desires and future politics . Would a reader from 1980 find this story comprehensible ? Let 's hope that a reader from 2040 will find this story impossible . <p> I LANDED MY EIGHTH JOB of the year on 21 November in Salt Lake City , and it was party time when 9:00 P.M. came around . Sure , I only had to work till 7:00 - the new Have-a-Life law was in effect - but nobody observed it . If you had a job it was work time , and if they paid you to sit in a cubicle crunching numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted and everybody knew it - so it was work hard , party in your dreams , then work hard some more starting 6:30 A.M. sharp . Life in America . Life , that is , till you could buy your way out of America . I 'd rented a one-bedroom with nine other guys , and the rent bothered me - I needed to invest that money , not hand it over to some landlord geek - but it was winter , and no matter how I added up the numbers it was cold outside . In summer you do n't need to rent . You can stay on the streets with your friends and talk investments , pick up tips on hot stocks , tie into your accounts through streetside netstands to do your buy and sell and check interest and dividends and , when you ca n't calc numbers anymore , sleep between high rises till you wake before dawn to check your accounts again . It 's a good life , but it does n't work well in winter . You do n't want to walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay rent . I stopped at a netstand . There were six guys and one long-haired Japanese ahead of me . I 'd seen her on the streets before . She was wearing unisex black cotton pants and a black blouse buttoned over the neck , black boots , belt , coat-homeless chic-and she looked good . She traded in weird commodities like krill and heavy metals . She grinned when she turned the booth over to me . " Silver 's up , " she said . " Cool , " I said , not thinking it was cool at all - it could n't have been up that much . Metals never were . I punched into my netbank account . My new employer had transferred over the day 's pay , on schedule . I surfed to the Bombay Stock Exchange , open in North America 's night , and bought three shares of Vindhya Pradesh biostock , then I surfed to my on-line broker and placed orders to sell my Hitachi at the open in New York and use that money to buy twenty-five more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up at 3:00 A.M. to check the price : if Vindhya Pradesh closed too high tonight , I 'd cancel the buy order and look for another bargain . I shoved my way out of the booth , headed for my apartment , and saw this guy I 'd never met before sitting on the granite lip of a flower planter , his red hair cut short , his black eyes watching me walk up the sidewalk , grinning to himself . I stopped in front of him , hands in my pockets to keep them warm . You never know who can turn into a decent business contact . I 'd need a new job in eight weeks when my contract ended . " Nice night , " I said . " Nicer now , " he said . That stopped me . " Nicer now " did n't sound like this guy wanted to do business , at least not with info and such . I thought maybe I should just walk away . Seeming the least bit attracted to another guy was n't safe , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided maybe I was n't thinking right . I decided cultivating a business contact was the right way to think . " Kurt , " I said by way of introduction . I stepped closer and stuck out my hand . " Bio-genetic stocks , human tissue futures . " " Michael , " he said , standing up and shaking my hand . " Bio-genetic stocks myself , pan-Asian infrastructure . " That could be interesting , I thought . I did n't know much about panAsia . We stood there talking Mongolian heavy industry in the cold . " Let 's get some coffee , " he said after we 'd stamped around for a while . He took me to a new coffeehouse , the Java Kayenko , where we ordered hot brew , plugged into the net from units at our table , and talked . I liked him . I liked him a lot . I realized at some point that anybody listening to our words might think they added up to courting , not business , because we did n't talk just pan-Asia and human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One beefy guy waiting at the counter looked away . Great , I thought , so somebody had taken notice . The other customers all sat hunched over their tabletop netscreens . None of them was paying us any attention that I could tell , none seemed to be eavesdropping for information to sell a Human Resources Department . The beefy guy walked past us and sat at the next table , back to us , alert , sipped his coffee . Michael stopped talking , sipped his own coffee , looked at me . All I could think was : I need my job . I surfed to a systemwide newsnet so I could watch the beefy guy and the people around us for a time , not for the info . I turned the screen so only Michael and I could see it . The lead story was about how farming improvements on Mars had led to the first significant drop in agricultural imports from Earth . Big deal , I thought - except that someday I wanted to be eating Martian food . " That 's where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the People 's Republic of Mars . " " Yeah , " I said , not really listening . " Me too . " The other top stories were about the Earth-based people-control crazies closer to home and their parade of new laws . I clicked on one , but was ready to click off in a hurry . Congress had that day passed its Just-Keeping-Track " Gay Problem " law by a not so narrow margin . Now single men and women twentyeight and older had to register with the police . If they changed their residence or employment they 'd have to reregister in two weeks or face stiff fines . Listed amendments included one that barred single men over thirty-eight from maintaining off-world holdings . They could invest only on-world if they wanted to stay American - easier for the government to track their money , I figured , to control it , to get their hands on it . The lead substory was about some gay New York designer agonizing over whether to sell his boutiques on the Moon and Titan Station or just head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if he had to wonder . He was somebody the new worlds would welcome . So when do they start rounding up people ? Michael typed . I just shook my head and erased his sentence . I had one year before I 'd have to register . I wondered what the police would say if I was living on the streets then and had no address ? Tina , the girl who worked the counter , headed our way to refill our cups and I clicked back to the Martian agriculture story . Tina knew Michael by name , but Michael told me she was his sister . The Japanese woman walked in , and she knew Michael . " Hey , Keiko , " Michael said . Keiko walked over . " What you doing hanging with this human-tissue geek ? " she asked . Look who 's talking , I thought , Ms. Silver 's Up . " That 's my business , " Michael said . Keiko eyed me up and down , then moved on . " You trade with her or something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her heavy metals , my Asian infrastructure - it 's a match . " I could see that . I could also see I had relationship work to do with Ms. Keiko . You do n't want bad vibes even from somebody who trades in heavy metals . You never know when you might need help with something that strange . What I could n't figure was why she was angry with me . We 'd hardly ever talked . A man at least six feet three inches tall walked in . He was n't wearing homeless chic - he wore the real thing : dirty , torn jeans ; thin , red coat . He stank past us into the back room and said hello to Michael on the way , slumped onto a couch by a heater . His coat had Mars Terraform Project patches on the sleeves . " Authentic , " Michael said . " He hated it out there . Bad as it is here , it 's better , he says . I do n't believe him . I 'll make it when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making it work . " Tina walked over to refill the sugar canister on our table . " Somebody stole the tip chit yesterday , " she told Michael . " A guy I 'd never seen before hung around the place . He claimed to be waiting for a phone call . I thought that sounded weird . Why would he wait for a phone call here ? E-mail maybe , but a phone call ? Five minutes later , I turned around and he was gone and the chit was gone . I 'll recognize him if he walks back in . " A customer stepped up to the counter . Tina went to get him what he wanted . I 'd had enough . I was nervous and wanted out . " The next work-day 's coming , " I told Michael . " I 'd better head to my rent-sink . " Michael looked at me . He 'd looked handsome when I 'd first met him . He looked even better now . I wanted out of the Java Kayenko , but I hesitated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks over , I typed . I live on the street , he typed back . Pan-Asia is n't cheap . I thought about that . Come over , I typed , finally . The floor 's warm . I have an extra blanket . OK ! : ) , he typed , grinning . But I ca n't leave now . I do n't want Tina to log off this place alone . It 's a cold night . That ex-terraformer is in a warm place - he might not want to leave . I thought about that and ended up waiting with him . The beefy guy left ten minutes before closing . He stared at Michael and me on his way out . The ex-terraformer left the third time Tina asked him to go . Tina lived upstairs . She waved good night as she locked the door behind us . Part of me thought I was stupid to be taking Michael home . Part of me asked why I would posit an equation I 'd wanted to solve but could n't not here , not on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys I lived with were all home , and two of them had also brought friends off the streets . Soon it was lights out . Michael got up with me at three o'clock to check stock prices . He beat me to the shower in the morning . We left for work together . Two days later , the day Salt Lake had its first real snowfall of winter , I sublet the space on the floor by my bed to Michael , and he moved onto it , which was good : he helped pay my rent . He had to stay out of everybody else 's space , but he did that , and every night after work , after the coffeehouses , he 'd lie in his blankets , and I 'd lie on my bed , and we 'd talk about everything : all the places we 'd worked the past year , December liver futures , how we 'd handled the last downturn , our goals for getting off Earth . " Do you think we 'll ever make it ? " Michael asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one some biology professor had given him just before Congress passed its No-Monkey-for-a-Mother law that barred teaching evolution in public schools and universities receiving federal funds . " We 'd better , " I said . " Both our mothers were monkeys . " Michael laughed , but my answer was n't just a joke . If you saw something ugly coming at you , you were smart to get out of its way . There was ugly coming at us from all directions . I wished our mothers had been Martians . WORK GOT WEIRD . First , I had an e-mail from HR telling me a citizen had come forward offering information about my personal life sufficient to warrant a Suspicious Activities Investigation . HR put me on notice that they would have to : Read all my current and archived company e-mail , checking for violations of company policy . Monitor my use of company computers till the end of my contract ( as if they had n't been doing that already ) . Interview co-workers in an attempt to discover whether I had ever violated company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lodged in the past , complaints not deemed credible enough at the time to warrant an investigation . If it was discovered that my personal conduct at work had in any way violated company policy , and if it was discovered that my personal conduct after hours had damaged or might damage the reputation of the company , my contract would be terminated . In that case , the company reserved the right to instigate legal proceedings to recover real or possible damages . A copy of the investigation 's final report , whatever the outcome , would become part of my Permanent Work Record , available to any future employer . Fine , I thought . Let them look - they would n't find anything . I 'd never dreamed of doing anything remotely suspicious on a company computer , with co-workers , on company time , at any company I 'd ever worked for . But then I started worrying about whether somebody somewhere could have misunderstood something I 'd said or done - and if they had , the company could sue me for imagined damages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ever get to Mars . I had to leave before then . I had to leave before the investigation was finished . That was all I could think . I tried to stay calm - I knew lawsuits could drag on forever , that I probably had plenty of time , that the investigation might not result in a lawsuit - but I worried anyway . I damn near shoved my fist through the computer monitor . HR called to ask me to come down to sign a First Amendment waiver , and by late afternoon they called again to tell me they 'd cleared my past e-mail . " All strictly business , " the HR bastard said . " What did you expect ? " I asked him . " This whole thing is a waste of time . And how much did you have to pay the fine citizen who complained about me ? " He would n't answer that , nor would he tell me what the nature of the complaints had been , but I could guess . Then , for days at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 10:00 P.M. , with no lunch or dinner breaks . If I ate at all I ate packaged crap from vending machines . It was a lot of : Hurry up and finish this . Get this project done ! Why are n't you done yet ? When can I have this ? How long do you think this will take ? I was beat . I wondered if they were trying to make me quit . I got in line at the first netstand after work one night to do my buy and sell , and who should be holding up the line but Ms. Silver 's Up herself , Ms. Keiko . Time to patch up differences with that contact , I thought . She turned away smiling from the netstand . The line moved forward . " How 's silver ? " I asked her when she walked by . I could n't think of anything else to say . " I got out of silver , " she told me . She stopped and looked me up and down , still smiling . She 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to talk about it . Brag a little . Fine by me . " I thought silver was up , " I encouraged her . " Oh , it is . I sold all of it and a little of this , a little of that , used a little inheritance , and now I 'm part owner of a ship heading out to mine the asteroids after another month of outfitting Up Top . I 'll be on her when she leaves . " " You made it ! " I said . I was genuinely impressed . It was n't often that you heard of somebody who 'd actually made it . " I 'm buying drinks tonight at Club Blue for a few old friends . You 've been a rude little shit and you 've got the attention of a guy I wanted , but if you come down I 'll buy you a drink . Bring Michael . " I just stood there , too shocked to say anything . People had heard what she 'd said . People stared at me , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you overheard talk of some guy having the attention of another guy . " I do n't want your drink , " I told her . People were still staring . Keiko just laughed and walked away . She looked back once and smirked . I hoped I 'd never see her again . I bought three more shares of Vindhya Pradesh biostock with the day 's wages , then put in an order to sell my Sony at the New York open and buy more Vindhya Pradesh . I checked the price of passage to Mars . It had dropped two point five percent because the new Titan shipyard had finally come on-line . I now had enough for a one-way and the secondhand gear I 'd need . Michael found me later in the Java Kayenko . " It 's almost one in the morning , " he said . " I got worried . " I just looked at him . That he 'd gotten worried and come looking worried me . What were we doing ? Where were we headed ? I wanted to be angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short his sublease of my floor-space , but I did n't and I was n't angry , not with him anyway . Keiko had worked through my equation . People I did n't even know were complaining to my company . How many others were going to add two and two and arrive at four before I could get out of here ? Michael pulled up a chair and sat down - and I let him . Why not , I thought ? What 's another Suspicious Activities complaint on my record ? " Did you see the newsnets ? " he asked . " Check this out .. " He called up an article on the new Truth-in-DNA law that mandated testing all government employees for the gay gene . If your results came back positive , you were fired . There were vids of surprised people being led out of their offices to the streets , claiming they had n't known , that the gene was a shock to them . Already the ACLU had gone to court to challenge the firings . There was plenty of speculation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how gay men and women could n't hide anymore in marriage - but I got tired of reading it . " Let 's get some sleep , " I said . " I want to help Tina log off first , " Michael said . We helped her log off , then started across the parking lot for home . Our steps were the only steps in new snow . Suddenly Michael grabbed my arm and jerked me toward him . We fell into a planter filled with dried , dead flowers and snow . A car without lights on sped past and barely missed us . " Die , Fags ! " people yelled as the car sped into the street . It was an old car , heavy , retro twentieth-century chic . You could smell its exhaust , and you could hear it . If it had been electric , Michael would n't have heard it coming . I did n't recognize the car or the voices . Michael and I stood and brushed ourselves off . Lights flicked on in three windows around the parking lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no point in reporting what had happened - the police would just ask what we 'd done to make a carload of guys decide we were fags . Michael and I went home to bed . But a short time later I woke up . Michael was sitting on his blankets , looking at me in the dark . " What are you thinking ? " he asked after a time . We could n't talk here - people sleeping around us might wake up and hear . " Let 's go check our stocks , " I whispered . We pulled on our pants , boots , coats , and headed out to a netstand nothing unusual in that . The streets were empty . We looked for cars , then started walking down the sidewalk , our breath misty around our faces in the cold . " It 's not what I 'm thinking , " I told him . " It 's what I 'm feeling . If I stop to think about this , I 'll get too scared . " He reached out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in shadow , holding hands . For a few steps I could n't breathe . It was the first time we 'd touched like that . His hand felt warm and good and strong . I could n't move my hand away , though I knew I should before someone saw what we were doing . I wanted to touch more of him than just his hand . " How long before they use those tests to restrict travel ? " he said . " I have enough to leave now , " I told him . " I 'm close . Tina is n't . " " Tina ? " " I ca n't leave her . " We were almost to the netstand and its island of light . I let go of his hand . " Why does she have to go ? " I asked while he logged on . " Same gene , " he said , and I looked around to see if anybody could be listening , but we were alone on the street . I knew the studies : if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if there were two they were likely a brother and sister . It was going to take Tina a long time at counter wages to save passage off-world . He turned the netstand over to me . " I want to go to Mars with you , " he said . " I want you to come , too , " I said . " No , " he said . " You do n't understand . I want to go with you . " It was say something now or never . He 'd said his part . I hit the Exit key and turned to look at him . " I 'm not leaving without you , " I said , and I meant it . I looked at him and realized I meant it - investigation or no investigation . He smiled at that . So we 'd done it , I thought . There was no going back . I took him to an alley I knew and we held each other and kissed and touched , but we heard something down the alley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slept . I could n't sleep . I kept thinking , kept trying to come up with a way for us to leave together soon . Sure , we could keep working , saving , and investing , but emigrating to Mars evidently meant bringing his sister - which was fine . If I 'd had a sister with the gay gene , I 'd have helped her get away , too . But it was going to slow us down . And it was probably just a matter of time before they started investigating Michael , maybe Tina , too . I ran through the options we had besides work and more of it : no bank would loan Michael and Tina money to go to Mars - they had no collateral to secure a loan . Mars has aggressive immigration-assistance programs , but it reserves its slots for people with technical expertise or some unusual skill . Number crunchers like Michael and me - and counter help like Tina - were n't on their lists . But as I lay there thinking , I realized I maybe knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to talk to about it : Ms. Keiko , of course - she with the money to buy a ship ; she with a ship in need of workers . Maybe she 'd loan Michael and Tina some money . Maybe she 'd let them work for partial passage . Maybe . It started to feel like a game of chess : move a piece here , move a piece there , move key pieces onto squares of power . I HAD AN E-MAIL from HR the next day telling me that six of my former employers had cleared me , two had received Suspicious Activities complaints not credible enough to warrant an investigation ( but they had forwarded the texts of those complaints ) , thirty-six had yet to respond . No word about the interviews with my current co-workers . Michael andI met Tina in her apartment before her shift to talk about Keiko and make plans . Both knew that Keiko had problems with me , but they got along fine with her and thought my idea worth a try . They had , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible before asking Keiko for the rest . Tina did n't have much . " What can you do to get more ? " I asked her . She looked at Michael . " I have some heirlooms , " she said , finally . " Dishes that have been in our family for generations . Mother gave them to me . It 's all I have of hers . " " Depression glass , " Michael said . " One of our great , great whatever grandmothers got it at her wedding . It was cheap then . " " What 's it worth now ? " " Last time I checked , a lot , " she said . We went downstairs , logged onto the net , and checked current prices at seven antique sites . She had twelve dinner plates in a pattern called Miss America , plus eight dessert plates , eight soup bowls , ten water glasses , one water pitcher , twelve cups and saucers , a cake plate , three serving bowls , two platters , a candy dish , a cream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , or full passage and part of the gear . " But I do n't want to lose those dishes , " Tina said . " Do you want to get off-world ? " I asked . She hesitated . She looked at Michael . " This just seems so unreal , " she said . " Can things really get much worse ? " I logged off and logged back on using a Java Kayenko guest ID - which they 'd charge for , but the only way I 'd surf to a gay newsnet was as Mr. Anonymous . If anybody out there was keeping track , all they 'd be able to tell was that some customer of the Java Kayenko had spent time on the wrong side of the Gay Problem . We pulled up the Lambda Legal Defense Fund 's chronology of the Gay Rights movement and its failure ; how all it had gotten in the past century was this government to accord separate  --  but-equal treatment and a few major corporations to offer what they 'd called " domestic partner " benefits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political conservatism had finally triumphed here and everywhere - how the New Conservatism had swept the world . Its anti-gay plank blamed gays for everything from " moral corruption " in the arts to falling birthrates in the Industrialized North . Governments that had at first refused to rescind equal-rights laws for gays did so under threat of sanctions . Denmark had held out for two years before giving in - the record on Earth . The LLDF site had an archive of every antigay pamphlet and tract , book and law written and passed by churches and governments in 206 countries . We just looked at the lists of titles that scrolled by screen after screen . Then we surfed to a gay newsnet and pulled up stories not reported anywhere else - like the one from Reno : four guys had driven a thirtythree-year-old gay man named Fred into the desert to kill him . They 'd beaten him till they 'd ruptured his spleen and one kidney , then they 'd pulled him to his feet , cocked their rifles , and told him he had sixty seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence into a dry ditch , and they 'd started shooting . He 'd crawled into an irrigation headgate , and they had n't been able to find him in the dark . He 'd already registered with the police , so when they came to the hospital to get his statement , they 'd assumed he was gay and had provoked his assault ; his insurance would n't pay the medical bills because of the police reports ; he 'd been fired from his job . We read similar stories from New York , . New Jersey , Missouri , Washington state - never mind the incarcerations in China and the executions in Zimbabwe and Central Asia . Tina decided to sell her dishes . Michael worked a second job sweeping public transports at the downtown terminus on his lunch hour , so I offered to take a lunch break and help Tina carry her dishes to an antique store to get them appraised and sold . When I got to her place she was standing at the sink , washing the dishes . They sparkled , pink , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The bottom edges were molded in patterns of tiny , three-sided pyramids that caught the light and made the glass look like cut crystal . " Mother always kept them perfectly clean , " Tina said . " They 're a little dusty now . " We wrapped each dish in paper and packed everything in three boxes . Tina taped the boxes shut , then looked at me . She did n't say anything for a time . She just held one of the boxes . " I ca n't do this , " she said finally . " I ca n't take them and sell them . Would you do it for me ? " " Sure , " I said . I felt bad for her , then . I took the boxes and left , walking ever so carefully around ice on the sidewalks . We 'd researched the prices . We knew the going rates for depression glass - Tina even sent printouts - so the dealer I went to could n't cheat her , though he would have liked to do so : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dishes . She got a fair price . I helped her invest her money . By the close that afternoon her stocks were up . I worked till 10:30 the next night , then did my buy and sell , then met Michael and Tina and looked around for Keiko . She was n't on the streets . We checked the coffeehouses and downtown bars . We stopped at a netstand to send her an e-mail . Before we 'd finished one cup at the Java Kayenko we had an answer . Keiko was at the Rio Grande sitting at a table under a picture of a man smoking inside a building . " Last chance for some decent Mexican , " she said over her plate of enchiladas and refried beans . We pulled up chairs . " We want to talk about your ship , " I said . " Oh honey , it 's hiring staff , but we want people with off-world experience , something none of you have . " She smirked at us . " We want to go to Mars , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on your ship or any other . " She put down her fork . " This is fun . Let me guess : You can pay and are oh so anxious to leave this hell-hole , but Mr. Cute Redhead - a guy you do n't think you can live without - ca n't pay , and neither can his sister whom he wo n't leave . " " Shut up , " I said . People at other tables were staring . If this deal did n't go through , we were in real trouble . " We need to borrow some of the money , " Michael said . " Or work off the passage , " Tina said . " Just like that . And I suppose you want me to loan you the money ? I suppose you think there 's some on-board espresso bar in need of a coffee bitch to scrub its counters ? " Michael and Tina looked at me , dismayed . " How do I know you 'll ever pay back the principle plus the twentytwo percent interest I charge ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have suggested this . I started thinking I should n't have gotten Michael 's and Tina 's hopes up . " Money 's tight for me , " Keiko said . " I 'm not sure about any loan to anybody . " " How about working for passage ? " Tina said . " You 're part owner of a ship - it might not be money you could loan us , and there has to be work we could do . " " Ship has to turn a profit , " Keiko said . " It 's not a nonprofit training course for charity cases . " She finished her enchiladas , and none of us said anything till then . A waiter cleared away her empty plate . " So what do I get out of this ? " Keiko asked . " Not you , Michael Redhead- unless boyfriend Kurt will let me have you Tuesday and Friday nights ? " Michael just laughed . " You 'll get your interest , " I told Keiko . " I 'll help them pay it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She logged onto the tabletop netscreen . " Let 's get this over with . The rate 's , like I said , twenty-two percent . This is n't a favor . Tell me how much you need and what you 'll be using it for . " Michael handed her printouts of the best prices we 'd found for Martian gear , and Keiko verified each price at discount warehouses on the net . She finally agreed that what Michael and Tina were asking for was right . She accessed a legal site and sent the necessary paperwork to the restaurant 's printer . Michael left to find that and brought back the papers . Tina and Michael signed for the loan . Keiko scanned in their signatures , then registered the loan with her on-line bank . She transferred the money to their accounts . " First payment 's due in one month , " Keiko said . " We 'll pay it on time , " Tina said . " You 're damned right you will , " Keiko said . " And in addition , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for partial passage . None of you has any experience , so you 'll be handed grunt work nobody wants - but it will save some of your precious money . Besides , I 'm not sure this bank approves of its creditors sinking into another gravity well . Maybe you 'll like it on-ship . " " It 's Mars for us , " Michael said . " How do you know it will work out better there ? " We did n't , of course . " Mars is a frontier world , " I said . " They wo n't waste time on genetic testing . They need anybody who can work . " Keiko smirked at that . " You 're probably right , " she said . " And you 'll grow old and die before that changes . " We all left the restaurant . " Why do n't you tell Kurt about yourself ? " Michael said to Keiko when we were outside . " You 've outed him and me . It 's only fair . " Keiko stopped walking and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I will , " Michael said . But Keiko did n't say anything . She took my hand and rubbed it against her cheek . I felt stubble there . " The drugs do a pretty good- job of controlling this , " she said . " But they wear off . " I had n't guessed . I had not been looking for that in her . I knew now why she always wore turtlenecks or buttoned her shirts over the neck to hide her Adam 's apple . " Why do.you think I helped you ? " Keiko asked . We spent two nights on-line after work taking the competency tests Martian immigration requires . Keiko was wrong about the value of Tina 's work skills off-Earth : the Martian Department of Labor estimated it had sixty-two food-service positions to fill each month and half that many applicants for the jobs . Since Tina had experience - not just at running a coffeehouse late at night but at logging it off and totaling the accounts - companies started e-mailing good offers to her , and she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of working into management . Michael and I did all right , too . Between us , we had eight interviews lined up with decent companies , including two brokerage houses . We got the necessary certifications from the Martian Secretary of Labor . The visas came in two weeks from the embassy in D.C. We bought work-for-partial-passage tickets on Keiko 's ship , said our good-byes , quit our jobs . My company told me they would complete the investigation and , if it found against me , their lawyers on Mars would contact me . Fine , I thought , let them . My money would be spent by then . I was leaving just in time . We went Up Top to finish getting outfitted for Mars . We bought all the gear we could in Salt Lake , on the net , or Up Top - if you arrived on Mars without some critical piece of equipment you could plan on paying top dollar for thirdhand junk . On our last day , we sat with our gear looking down at the Earth . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests people were being forced to take , the new laws , the growing fear . We were lucky , and we knew it . Michael pulled a small package wrapped in burgundy paper and white ribbon out of his backpack and handed it to Tina . " Open it , " Michael told her . " It 's from Kurt and me . A good-bye Earth surprise . " Her hands trembled as she undid the ribbons and the wrapping , opened the box , folded back the white tissue paper , and lifted up one of four Miss America depression-glass dessert plates . They 'd been her ancestor 's . I had n't sold them . I 'd kept those four plates back so she 'd have something her mother had given her . The plate sparkled in the harsh light of the dock . Tina could n't talk , not even to thank us . " We washed them before we packed them , " I said . " They had fingerprints all over them . " Michael had agreed with my not selling the dessert plates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tina , so he and I had settled on secondhand respirators instead of brand-new ones - but we 'd bought new filters and replaced the oxygen tanks , then spent days overhauling them , oiling them , testing them , making sure they 'd work for as long as we 'd need them before we could afford to buy new ones , which would be in about a year and a half , I figured . Forty-six shares of Vindhya Pradesh biostock had brought in the rest of the money . " We 'll need something pretty to look at where we 're going , " Michael said . I thought about that . It had n't been so long before that people had made those plates - in the Depression , in a time of suffering . I looked down at the Earth . They still made beautiful things there , I thought . Maybe the continued making of beautiful things and the way we value beautiful things from the past should have given us hope that the world would n't go completely wrong . I did n't know . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate and put it back in the box . She kissed Michael , then she kissed me . We did not have long to wait before we boarded our ship out . Photograph <p>
