In the eight years since Carol Moore 's daughter Michelle was brutally raped and murdered in Norfolk , Va. , the holidays have always seemed to shine a spotlight on that empty chair at the table . This Thanksgiving was one of the worst . Just two weeks before the feast , three Navy sailors who had confessed to killing her daughter and are serving life sentences filed a petition maintaining their innocence and requesting a full pardon . Wounds Moore had hoped were slowly closing were ripped open again . She went through the motions of the holiday like a zombie , forgetting things , unable to focus , crying . She ca n't imagine those men going free . She knows they did it , because she heard them  --  as she listened to their taped confessions at the trials  --  describe the gruesome things they did to her daughter . " They 're guilty . Guilty . Guilty . Guilty . That 's it , " Moore told TIME over the phone last week . " How could someone confess to something like that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false confession is precisely what the three sailors say they did do . In their Nov. 10 petition to outgoing Virginia Governor Mark Warner , Danial Williams , Derek Tice and Joseph Dick Jr . claim that after Norfolk homicide detectives subjected them to hours of harsh and manipulative questioning , they fabricated elaborate details of a rape and murder that they had absolutely nothing to do with . The three were only part of a larger group of eight men who , over the course of a two-year investigation and three trials , were charged with the 1997 murder of Navy wife Michelle Moore-Bosko . Five of the men at one time or another confessed , but just one , Omar Ballard , had any material evidence linking him to the scene of the crime . ( One of the men , Eric Wilson , was convicted only on charges of rape and released earlier this fall after more than seven years in prison ; charges were eventually dropped against three others . ) <P> Over the past year , a team of lawyers , approached by the nonprofit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews , gathering documents and asking experts to compare the confessions of the sailors with the crime-scene evidence . What the team compiled was a laundry list of inconsistencies that it hopes will be enough to sway Warner just as the Governor is about to leave office and possibly make a run for the Democratic presidential nomination . Warner just last week spared the life of death-row inmate Robin Lovitt , citing the destruction of DNA evidence that might have cleared his name . But with no looming execution date for the Norfolk Three , their request could fall to Warner 's successor , Tim Kaine . <P> Hard as their story may be for Carol Moore and others to believe , the Norfolk Three 's case is just the latest instance of judicial reappraisal in which DNA evidence seems to contradict previous criminal confessions . In recent years , new DNA sequencing technology has allowed the American justice system to right more than 150 wrongful convictions  --  and almost a quarter of those had been based on a false confession . The most high-profile example is the 1989 Central Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raping a woman were cleared 13 years later after DNA analysis of evidence could n't link them to the crime scene .
