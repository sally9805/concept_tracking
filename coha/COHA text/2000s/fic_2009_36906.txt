Twelve hours into the return journey from Admiralty House , Captain Oliver Worthy felt the familiar but unwelcome scratchiness in his throat and ache in his ears . " Oh , damn , " he whispered . This was no time to be afflicted with the deep-water sailor 's commonest complaint  --  putrid ear and throat . <p> He tried to get comfortable in the chaise , mentally ticking off a long list of duties upon arrival in Plymouth , all of which trumped any ailments . The dockmaster was waiting for his final appraisal and list of repairs to the Tireless . The warped mast  --  the result of patching two splintered ones together  --  was bad enough . Even worse , the inept captain of the Well-spring , who had crashed his bow into the Tireless 's stern , caused more damage to a vulnerable part of the ship . Welcome to life on the blockade . <p> He had to make arrangements with the purser to complete the laborious resupply lists that ran on for mind-numbing pages . The chances of receiving all requested stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also intended to release his crew , a few at a time , for shore leave . Oh , Lord , details and paperwork . <p> Right now  --  nauseated from the post chaise 's motion , his head pounding and his throat as painful as sandpaper grating on bruised knuckles  --  all he wanted was a bed in a quiet room , with the guarantee not to be disturbed for at least a week . <p> Even more than that , all he wanted was a glass of water , and then another one , until he no longer felt that his insides were coated with slimy water stored months in a keg . <p> No landsman who took a drink of water for granted would understand the feeling of thirst beyond belief , as he stared long and hard at a cup of water , green and odorous . After a month or two , the water would even begin to clump together , until swallowing the offending mass was like choking down someone else 's spittle . After only a few years at sea , he developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two months old . <p> Then there were the days of thirst , especially in winter , when the water hoys from Plymouth were delayed because of stormy weather . Days when even a drop from the malodorous kegs  --  now empty  --  would have been welcome relief . Like all the others on the Tireless , he tried hard not to think of water , but surrounded by water as they always were , such a wish was not possible . <p> Past Exeter , where the view of the ocean usually made his heart quicken , he began to reconsider his impulsive agreement with Lord Ratliffe . The whole thing was odd . At Admiralty House , he had made his report of Channel activity , this time to William Stokes , Viscount Ratliffe , an undersecretary more than usually puffed up with his own consequence , and someone he generally tried to avoid . <p> Oliver had been irritated enough when Lord Ratliffe tried to pry into his Spanish sources , something no captain  --  even under Admiralty Orders  --  would ever reveal . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it was Oliver 's own fault . He should n't have admitted the Tireless would be in dry docks for at least a month . But the undersecretary had picked up on it like a bird dog . <p> " A month ? " <p> " Aye , my lord . " <p> " Not going home to your family ? " <p> " I have no family . " Too true , although why a country vicar and his wife should succumb to typhoid fever in dull-as-dishwater Eastbourne , when their only child had survived all manner of exotic ailments from around the world , was still beyond him . No family . A wife was out of the question . He seldom met women , and he was too cautious to trouble any with a seafaring mate . In these times of war , he might as well hand over a death warrant with the marriage lines . <p> " I want to show you something . " <p> Ratliffe had picked up a miniature from his untidy desk and handed it to Oliver , who could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young lady approaching  --  or smack on the edge of  --  womanhood . Her hair was the same shade as Ratliffe 's , but he could see no other resemblance . The miniaturist had dotted tiny freckles across the bridge of her nose . <p> Her eyes had caught and held him : brown pools of melting chocolate . He glanced at the viscount 's eyes . Blue . <p> " She resembles her mother . " <p> After another look , Oliver handed back the miniature . <p> " Pretty , is n't she ? " <p> More than pretty , Oliver thought . <p> " She 's old now . Twenty-one . This was painted when she was sixteen . " Ratliffe sighed heavily , almost theatrically , to Oliver 's ears . " She lives in Plymouth in a run-down inn owned by her grandmother , Nancy Massie , a regular shrew . Twenty-two years ago , I was in Plymouth . I made the mistake of dallying with the shrew 's daughter . Eleanor is the result . " <p> Oliver could n't think of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hardly seemed appropriate , and to offer his condolences seemed even less palatable . He knew the viscount would continue , however . <p> " I did the right thing by Eleanor , " Lord Ratliffe said , putting down the miniature . " As soon as she was five , I had her sent to a female academy in Bath , where she was raised and educated . " <p> Oliver hoped he covered up his surprise . The country must be full of by-blows , and his superficial acquaintance with the viscount gave him no inkling Lord Ratliffe was one to own up to his responsibility . Imagine , he thought , bracing himself for whatever favor Lord Ratliffe had in mind . <p> Ratliffe threw up his hands . " When the child was sixteen , she suddenly bolted from Miss Pym 's school and returned to Plymouth ! I had made her an excellent offer regarding her future , and she thanked me by leaving my care and bolting to that wretched seaport ! " He glanced at Oliver . " You 're a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine my distress . " <p> Oliver could , even as he could also feel his suspicion growing . Although he had only been a post captain for two years , he had commanded men for many more . Something in Ratliffe 's tone did not ring true . <p> " Would you do me the favor of staying at the Mulberry Inn  --  that 's the name of it  --  during your time in Plymouth ? Look things over and let me know how things are with Eleanor . " He leaned closer . " I am certain a few days would suffice to get the drift of matters . I could not bear it if Eleanor has fallen on hard times . " <p> " I usually stay at the Drake , my Lord , " Oliver temporized . " My sea chest is there already . " <p> Ratliffe sighed again , which only irritated Oliver . He was ready to say no , when the viscount shifted his position , and there was Eleanor Massie smiling up at him from the desk . Captivated in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful promise in so small a space . A moment earlier , he might have just felt old . Now he felt something close to joy . For all he knew , the earth 's axis had suddenly shifted under Admiralty House . Was the Astronomer Royal aware ? <p> What harm would it do to stay a week at the Mulberry ? He could look over the situation , make sure the shrew was n't beating her granddaughter twice a day before breakfast , pen a report to the viscount and retreat to the Drake . <p> " I 'll do it , my lord , " Oliver said . <p> The viscount looked for a moment as if he were going to take Oliver by the hand , but he refrained . " Thank you , Captain Worthy . You 'd probably understand my concern better if you had a daughter . " <p> That will never happen , Oliver thought , as he returned his attention to the November scenery outside the post chaise window . Only a crazy woman would marry a captain on the blockade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He closed his eyes after Exeter , deciding to abandon Miss Eleanor Massie to her fate . But as the post chaise stopped in front of the Drake later that afternoon , he knew he could n't go back on his word , no matter how much he wanted to . <p> If Mrs. Fillion had been standing inside with a pitcher of water , he would have changed his mind again , but she was busy arguing with a tradesman . Oliver had quite forgotten into what octaves her voice could rise when she was on a tirade , and it made him wince . He came inside the inn and looked into the Den of Thieves . Sure enough , the perpetual whist game was in progress . Whist anywhere but the Drake tended to be a polite game , but he knew how noisy poor losers could be , and the room he usually rented was right overhead . <p> Mrs. Fillion drew breath from her rant concerning greengrocers in general , and this one in particular , and glanced his way . She came over immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve . <p> He held up his hand before she could even begin , trying to look apologetic and adamant at the same time . " Mrs. Fillion , I know my sea chest is already here , but I believe I will stay at the Mulberry this time . Can you direct me to it ? " <p> You would have thought he had requested her to strip naked and turn somersaults through the Barbican , so great was her surprise at his request . Then a funny thing happened . She got an interesting look in her eyes , one he could n't quite read . <p> " Captain , that is probably an excellent choice right now , " she said . " It 's only a mile away and not fancy , but you look like someone who could use some solitude . " <p> I look that bad ? he asked himself , amused , in spite of how dreadful he felt . " I think you 're right , " he said . " Let me send in the coachman and you can give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you summon him ? I 'll just wait for a moment . " <p> After letting his lieutenant know of his change in plans , Oliver struggled to his feet and walked slowly to the post chaise , hating the thought of getting inside again , but desperate to lie down , no matter how horrible the Mulberry Inn was . <p> If that was a mile , it was a longer one than found most places , Oliver decided , as the post chaise finally stopped in front of a narrow building of three stories . It was covered mostly with ivy that continued to cling stubbornly to the stonework , even though the November wind was trying its best to dislodge it . Paint flaked on the windowsills and door , but the little yard was as neat as a pin . He looked back toward the harbor . It 's a wonder anyone stays so far away , he thought . <p> The post boy shouldered his sea chest and leather satchel and took it to the front door , which was opened by an old man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked , as the old fellow  --  he had to be a seafaring man  --  took the chest from the post boy . <p> " Captain , you 're our first lodger in at least six months . " <p> Oliver stared at him . " I 'll be damned ! I thought this was an inn . How on earth do you manage to stay open ? " <p> " We 've been asking ourselves that lately , " the sailor said and shook his head . <p> Oliver came toward him , trying to walk in a straight line . " Maybe I should n't even ask this , " he began , " but is lodging just room , or does it include board ? " <p> " Just room right now , sir , " the old sailor said uncertainly . Oliver watched him glance at the post chaise , which had only gone a little way down Gibbon Street . " If you want , I 'll call ' im back , sir . We wo n't deceive ye . " <p> Oliver stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard someone else at the front door . He turned his head , even though he ached from the neck up . <p> It must be Eleanor Massie , even though her hair was cut quite short , in contrast to the miniature Lord Radcliffe had shown him . Her eyes were the same , though : pools of brown , and round like a child 's . She wore an apron over a nondescript stuff dress , but Oliver could n't think of a time when he had ever seen a lovelier sight . Even more to the point , she was looking straight at him , her brow wrinkling in what appeared to be deep concern for someone she did n't even know . <p> " I 'll be staying , " he heard himself say . <p> Maybe it was the combination of little food , no sleep , the swaying motion of the post chaise , the roaring in his ears , his throbbing head and the ill humors lodged in his throat . Before he could even warn anyone , he turned away and was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long summer and had probably wanted to survive  --  hardy things  --  beyond late fall . Too bad for them . <p> " Pete cleaned him up . He 's tucked in bed now , and all he wants is water , " Gran said , as Nana came up the narrow stairs with her tray . <p> Eyes closed , Captain Worthy lay propped up in bed , the picture of misery , with red spots burning in his cheeks . He opened his eyes , and almost smiled at what she carried . He indicated the table by the bed . " Set it there and pour me a glass . " <p> She did as he said , and handed it to him . He drained the glass and held it out for more . Only a little water remained in the pitcher when he closed his eyes . <p> " Can can I get you anything else , sir ? " she asked . " Is there someone we can write who can be here to nurse you ? " <p> " There is n't anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " No , Miss Massie , " he said . " The blockade is the devil 's own business and I 'd never share it with another living soul . That old salt " <p> " Pete Carter ? He works for Gran . " <p> " tells me there is no board here . " <p> " With the blockade and general shortages , Captain , we do n't have the clientele or the resources to provide food anymore . I 'm truly sorry . " She hesitated . His eyes never left her face . " Perhaps you will want to reconsider and return to the Drake tomorrow . " <p> " No . I am here to stay until my ship is out of dry dock . " <p> " You really want to stay at the Mulberry ? " she asked in frank surprise . <p> She could tell he felt miserable , and he was having a hard time keeping his eyes open . " Well , yes , " he replied , even smiling a little . " Am I , er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small schoolboy in that moment that she had to laugh . " Of course you are ! We 're delighted to have you . It 's just that meals " <p> He pointed to the bureau . " Pete said he stowed my purse in the top drawer . Get it out , please , Miss Massie , and take what you need to provide me with three meals a day . Right now I favor porridge with lots of cream and sugar , mainly because I do not think anything else will stay down . " <p> She had never rustled about in someone else 's possessions before , but the captain appeared to expect it , so she did , pulling out his purse . She closed the drawer quickly and brought the purse to his bed . He opened it and she tried not to stare at the coins . <p> He counted out a generous handful . " When this is gone , just ask for more . Miss Massie , I like to eat well when I am in port . " He looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did n't . " I expect the people who run the inn to eat well , too . " <p> " Certainly , sir . Can I get you anything now ? " <p> " What are you having for dinner ? " <p> " A little tea and toast , " she replied , then wished she had said nothing , or lied , because it was starvation food . " I mean , I ate a large meal at noon and was n't " <p> He took her by the wrist . " Miss Massie , I intend to stay at the Mulberry for a month , but if you tell me another lie , I 'll be gone tomorrow . " <p> " Yes , Captain , " she replied , her voice no more than a whisper . " T-toast . " <p> " And breakfast ? " <p> She shook her head , too embarrassed to look at him . He was still holding her wrist , but his grip was easy . <p> He let go of her then , and relaxed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher of water . Would you do me a favor ? " <p> " Anything , Captain , " she said and meant it . <p> " Ask Pete if he knows a good remedy for sailor 's throat . " <p> " He has a thousand cures , almost as many as Scheherazade had tales . " <p> Her answer made him smile . " I 'll wager he has . And might youryour grandmama know of a poultice for my throat ? " <p> That is odd , she thought . How does he know about Gran ? " Have you stayed here before ? " she asked . " I do n't believe I mentioned Gran . " <p> It was his turn to look confused . " Pete must have said something , " he replied . <p> " That 's a whopper , " she said candidly , looking him in the eyes . <p> He looked at her in exasperation . " I do believe an older woman was in here when Pete relieved me of my uniform and bared me to the skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She left the room , smiling to herself . <br> Continues ...
