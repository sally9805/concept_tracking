Send your health questions to " Ask Doctor Cory , " Children 's Digest , PO . Box 567 , Indianapolis , IN 46206 or email us at **32;274;TOOLONG . This column does not replace your doctor 's advice . Dear Dr. Cory : I am 12 years old and I still can not touch my toes without bending my knees . Do you have any methods I can use to stay in shape and finally be able to touch my toes ? Deanna Andrisani Flushing , Now York Dear Deanna : Do you warm up before you stretch ? Warm-ups get the blood moving to your muscles and help to loosen your joints . Taking a brisk walk or riding a bike for ten minutes should be enough to get you ready for stretching . Your body temperature is at its lowest in the early morning and highest toward the end of the day . So keep in mind that it may take your muscles longer to warm up in the morning . After warming up , begin your stretch forward to the point of tightness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax before going into the stretch again , this time slightly farther , and hold it for another 15 to 30 seconds . Keep progressing in this way . You may not reach your toes the first few days of trying this , but if you warm up properly and gradually work toward it , you should soon be touching your toes . A stretch should never be painful . If you ca n't quite reach as far as you want , never bounce . Bouncing can cause a tear in your muscle . Stretching the major muscle groups should be done before and after any strenuous exercise . Stretching helps to increase your range of motion , muscle strength , coordination , and flexibility . Muscles that are strong and flexible do not become injured as easily . Be patient . Some people are more flexible than others . Work at your own pace and try not to rush . Dear Dr. Cory : I hit my head when I was seven . I am now ten and have more painful headaches . They do n't come very often though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or because of my head , or both ? Ellen Branstiter Fort Worth , Texas Dear Ellen : Although I am sure that it really hurt at the time , it is very unlikely that your headaches are from when you hit your head when you were seven . There are many causes of headaches . Often they are signs of another illness , such as a sinus infection , an infection caused by a virus or a bacteria , an allergy , or dental problems . Skipping meals , not getting enough fluids , sleep problems , pressure or stress , certain medicines , and certain foods can all cause headaches . One type of headache , called a migraine headache , is often described as a throbbing pain on one side of the head . The pain is due to the enlargement of the blood vessels in the covering of the brain . Migraines can make you feel dizzy and sick to your stomach . They tend to be chronic ( recur off and on ) , usually with certain symptoms each time . The symptoms vary from person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache will occur ( a premonition ) , along with visual disturbances , such as flashes of light . The pain can last for several hours . Without treatment , it usually goes away with sleep . Prescription medicine is available that prevents migraines that interfere with daily activities . Almost everyone gets headaches now and then . They usually are not a serious problem unless they are sudden and severe . This could be a sign that there are other problems within the head or central nervous system . Most times , however , they can be treated with rest and a mild pain reliever , such as acetaminophen . You may want to keep a " headache diary " to identify some of the things that trigger your headaches . Each time you have a headache , write down what you were doing before the headache began , how long it lasted , and what seemed to make it better . Once these triggers are identified , they can sometimes be avoided to help prevent the headaches . See you next issue ! Your friend , Cory SerVaas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
