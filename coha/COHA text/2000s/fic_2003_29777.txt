I was a mile upriver , my feet planted on the stained concrete dam , back bent to the task of yanking my canoe over the abutment . It was past midnight and a three-quarter moon hung in the South Florida sky . In the spillover behind me , tea-colored water from the falls burbled and swirled , roiling up against itself and then spinning off in curls and spirals until going flat and black again downstream . Ahead I could see the outlines of thick tree limbs and dripping vine and the slow curve of water bending around a corner before it disappeared into darkness . When I moved onto this river more than a year ago , my city eyes were nearly useless . My night vision had always been aided by street lamps , storefront displays , and headlights that swept the streets , crosshatching each other to create a web of light at every intersection . I 'd spent my life on the Philadelphia streets , watching , gauging the hard flat shadows , interpreting the light from a door left ajar , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a match strike . Out here , fifteen miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean in a swamped lowland forest , it took me a month to train my eyes to navigate in the night 's natural light . Tonight , in moonlight , the river was lit up like an avenue . When I got the canoe floated in the upstream pool , I braced myself with both hands on the rails at either side , balanced my right foot in the middle , steadied myself in a three-point stance , and pushed off onto quiet water . I settled into the stern seat and pulled six or seven strokes to get upstream from the falls and then readied myself . The mile from my stilted shack had just been a warm-up . Now I 'd get into the heavy work that had become my nightly ritual . This time of year in South Florida , high summer when the afternoon rains came like a rhythm , this ancient river to the Everglades spread its banks into the cypress and sabal palms and flooded the sawgrass and pond apple trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tributary . It was also the time of year when a man with a head full of sour memories could power a canoe up the river 's middle and muscle and sweat through yet another impossible night . I tucked my right foot under the seat , propped my left forward against a rib , and was just pulling my first serious strokes when my eyes picked up a glow ahead in the root tangle of a big cypress . Trash , I thought , pulling two strokes hard in that direction . Even out here you ran into civilization 's callousness . But the package seemed too tight as I glided closer . Canvas , I could tell now from the cream-color of the cloth . I took one more stroke and drifted up to what now appeared to be a bundle the size of a small duffel bag . The package was wedged softly into a crook of moss-covered root by the current . I reached out and prodded it with my paddle , loosening the hidden end from the shadows . When it finally slid out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , dead face of a child . Air from deep in my throat held and then broke like a bubble in my mouth and I heard my own words come out in a whisper : " Sweet Jesus . Not again . " *** For a dozen years I 'd been a cop in Philadelphia . I got in at the smooth-faced age of nineteen without my father 's blessing . He was a cop . He did n't want me to follow . I went against his wishes , which had become a habit by then , and got through the academy the same way I 'd gotten through school . I rode the system , did just enough to satisfy , did n't stand out , but tried always to stand up . My mother , bless her soul , called it a sin . " Talent , " she said , " is God 's gift to you . What you do with it , is your gift back to him . " According to her , my talent was brains . My sin was using only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At six feet three inches tall , and a little over two hundred pounds , I 'd played some undistinguished football in high school and my friend Frankie O'Hara used to drag me into his father 's South Philly gym once in a while to act as a stand-in sparring partner . My strength there was that I did n't mind getting hit . A shot in the face never bothered me much . How that trait worked with my other " talent , " my mother could never explain . But the combination of a cloaked intelligence , some size , and an indifference to a crack on the nose made police work easy for me . In my years on the force I 'd climbed a bit of a ladder , taken some special assignments , worked for a short time in the detective bureau . I 'd passed the sergeant 's exam a couple of times . But misunderstandings with management and " Officer Freeman 's seeming total lack of ambition " found me walking a downtown beat on the four-to-twelve shift . It was fine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . *** It was near the end of my shift . I was standing out of a cold drizzle at Murphy 's Newsstand , a little step-in shop next to a deli just off Broad Street . Murph peddled the daily newspapers , three shelves of magazines holding the monthly array of faked-up cleavage , and probably the most important item of his business , the daily racing forms . With some thirty years on the street , Murph was the most sour and skeptical human being I 'd ever met . He was a huge lump of a man who sat for hours at a time on a four-legged stool with what seemed like half of his weight dripping over the sides of the small circular cushion . He had a fat face that folded in on itself like a two-week-old Halloween pumpkin and you could n't tell the color of his small slit eyes . He was never without a cigar planted in the corner of his mouth . " Max , you 're a fuckin ' idiot you stay on a job what wit da way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard conversation with me every night for two years . He had a voice like gravel shuffling around in the bottom of a cardboard box . And he called everyone from the mayor to his own mother a " fuckin ' idiot , " so you did n't take it personally . On that night he was grumbling over the day 's results from Garden State Raceway when my radio started crackling with a report of a silent alarm at C &M's; Stop and Shop on Thirteenth Street , just around the corner . I reached down to turn up the volume and Murph rolled the cigar with his tongue and that 's when we heard the snap of small caliber gunfire in the distance . The old vendor looked straight into my face and for the first time in two years I could see that his eyes were a pale , clear blue . " Casamir , " he croaked as I started out the open door , my hand already going to the holster strap on my 9mm . It does n't take long for adrenaline to flush into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city I had heard too many . And each time I had to fight the immediate urge to turn and walk the other way . I was halfway to the corner and my normally slow heartbeat was banging in my chest . I was trying to set up a scene in my head of Casamir 's place ; second storefront around the corner , glass doors flush against the wall , dingy fluorescent lighting inside , Casamir with his too-big smile and that pissy little taped-handled .25 behind the counter . I was n't thinking about the rain-slick sidewalk or the lack of decent cover when I made the corner and tried to plant my foot and went skidding out in full view of some kid 's gun barrel . Snap . I heard the crack of his pistol but barely registered the sharp smack against my neck and I came up on one knee , brought up the 9mm and saw the kid standing thirty feet away , a black hole of a gun barrel as his only eye . I was staring into that hole when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's door and then Snap , another round went off . I hesitated for one bad instant , and then pulled the trigger . My weapon jumped . My eyes instinctively blinked . Chaos competed for only a second . And then the street went quiet . The first kid went down without so much as a whimper . Casamir 's .25 had sounded the third report of the night and caught the shooter in the street flush in the temple . My round hit the second boy , the one who had jumped out the door just as I hesitated . The 9mm slug caught him in the back between his skinny shoulder blades and he dropped . Unlike the Hollywood version , the kid did n't get blown back from the impact . He did n't get spun around . He did n't slowly crumple to his knees or try to reach out and call someone 's name . He just melted . The noise of my own gun was ringing in my ears and I must have been getting up because the angle of the scene was changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . Casamir was standing over the bodies by the time I made it thirty feet . He looked up at me , the old .25 hanging from his hand . " Max ? " he said , confused at my presence . His face was blank . His smile was gone . Maybe forever . The first boy was facedown , the pistol that he had fired , first at Casamir and then at me , had clattered off into the gutter . The younger boy , mine , lay oddly twisted , his clothes , all baggy and black , seemed comically empty . But his face was turned up , his open eyes gone cloudy through long , childlike lashes . He could n't have been more than twelve . I was staring into that face when Murph , trailing from the newsstand , stepped up to my side and looked at me and then down at the kid . " Fuckin ' idiot , " he says . But I was n't sure which one of us he was talking about . I was still staring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid burbling in my throat and then I heard Casamir repeating my name : " Max ? Max ? " And I looked up and he was staring at me and pointing to his neck and saying , " Max . You are shot . " And suddenly that night , and that world , went softly black .
