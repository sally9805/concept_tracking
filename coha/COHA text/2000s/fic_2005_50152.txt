" The past is a foreign country , " wrote L. P. Hartley . " They do things differently there . " And yet it seems the human heart functions the same in both 2005 and in the Silurian Age . Or so suggests Mr. Utley in his latest story . How they do things in the future is open to discussion , but we expect that Mr. Utley 's collection The Beasts of Love will be available in mere months and a collection of time-travel stories entitled Where or When should be out around the end of this year . <p> TIM 'S COLOR HAD IMPROVED by the time Rene found him on the starboard catwalk under the helicopter deck . She gave him a solicitous smile and said , " Feel better now ? " " No . Just emptier . " " You 're carrying on a great tradition . Charles Darwin was seasick most of the time he spent aboard the Beagle . " He looked sheepishly at the calm graptolite-choked sea ; the surface glistened with sunlight reflected from the creatures " semitransparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Darwin , but I 'm ashamed of myself . I feel like I 've just defiled this place . " " You 'll get your sea legs yet . " " It was n't until this trip that I 've ever been out of sight of land in my whole life . " " Well , perk up , we 're almost there , " and she directed his attention to a point off the starboard bow . From that distance , the island looked like nothing so much as an immense heap of broken glass . Most of the Paleozoic real estate they had seen before now had tended toward dun , the grayish brown of barren , heavily weathered rock . This island was as black as tar , with here and there a gleam of sunlight on a ribbon of moving water . Rivulets rushed down from the interior ; waterfalls cascaded directly into the sea or splashed onto scree at the bases of jagged cliffs . In places the cliffs dropped straight into the sea ; elsewhere the waves had gouged out caves or carved away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These sea stacks stoically endured endless battering while , behind them , the cliffs retreated across rocky , wave-cut platforms . Tim made a face . " Not really a place you 'd want to bring the family . " " Oh , I do n't know . That 's prime pre-Pangaean oceanfront property . Grand view of Panthalassa . Put in a concession stand , some rides , a water park - people would come from eons around . " " Think Dick 'll like it ? " Now more than ever before , she thought , Dick is incapable of liking anything . But she said , " He 'd goddamn well better like it , after what we 've done to get him here . And he 's going to have it all to himself once we 've come and gone . A whole prehistoric island to call his own . " " Where do you suppose it 'll end up - plate-tectonically speaking ? " She shrugged . " Part of Scotland , maybe Ireland . " " Scotland and Ireland are good . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They should be just about ready for us in the boat bay . You sure you 've got everything ? " " Everything . Everything except breakfast , lunch , and dinner , that is . And my socks . Those came up right after dinner did . I wish we could fly over in a " copter . " " Take it up with the Navy . Besides , I thought you said you suffer from airsickness , too . " " Airsickness , seasickness , carsickness . I can be utterly miserable on land and sea and in the air . " " You 're certainly versatile . " " It 's the hike once we get ashore that I 'm not looking forward to . " They went below decks and waited until the bluejackets had finished stowing equipment and supplies into the boat . Then they stepped aboard and took their places under a canvas awning , and their Navy pilot deftly maneuvered the craft out into the open and made for shore . He put in to a cove where the sea had first created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , enlarged it . A second bluejacket had stationed himself in the bow as lookout . From time to time he raised his left or right hand , and the pilot gave the wheel a twist . The water here was smooth and clear , and on the bottom lay large , dark , irregular masses capable of holing the boat 's hull . Two other Navy men , including an older one who was in charge , sat amidships . No one spoke . The only sound was the thrum of the boat 's motor . Within the cove , rubble from the crumbling cliffs encircled a muddy fringe of beach . One section of cliff had collapsed entirely . The landing party , comprising the two civilians and three of the Navy men , had to climb the steeply graded scree burdened with all their gear before they could at last consider themselves safely ashore . When they were about halfway up , Rene overheard one young sailor remark that " that skinny old lady climbs like a goat , " and called a halt for rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying degrees of interest and bemusement , she and Tim poked among the rocks and exclaimed in delight as they fished out wriggling primitive arthropods and insubstantial green plants . Tim showed the Navy men his muddy fingers . " Ah ? " said the one in charge . " Dirt , " said Tim . " Soil . " " Ah , " said the Navy man . " That 's good . " He sounded tentative , almost dubious . " Next time , " said another , younger Navy man , " I hope you folks 'll pick someplace closer to home and not so high out of the water . " The Navy man in charge nodded agreement . " What 's so special about this island ? " " It 's on the dark side of the world . " Tim nodded toward the horizon . " All your major landmasses are thataway . From there all the way around to back of there is one big stretch of ocean with just the occasional crescent of volcanic islands wherever there 's a subduction zone close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution . We can expect to find some very strange species here . " " Oh , thrill , " said the young bluejacket . " Like there are n't enough strange species back at Stinktown . But why this island ? " " It was named for a colleague of ours . So , when we started planning this little field trip - well , we wanted a remote island , so we said , " Why not this one ? " It fit our needs . Isolated , yet not literally on the back side of the world . " " Well , " the young sailor drawled , " if I was your colleague , I 'd be more particular about what I gave my name to . " " He 's dead . We submitted his name to the nomenclature committee . They applied it to this island . " " Sorry , " the sailor said . " He died a long time ago , " Rene said , " or a long time from now , however you want to put it . " ANURSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They exchanged smiles , and Rene asked , " How is he ? May I see him ? " " Go right in . His wife 's with him . But he 's not being polite to anybody today . You 'll have to stand in front of the television to get him to pay you any attention . He 's into one of his science things . " Rene ventured an experiment . " Do you know what it is , this science thing ? " The nurse lifted her shoulders in a meaty shrug . " I 'm afraid I could n't tell you if my life depended on it . Science is n't something they teach in nursing school . " " No . Of course not . " The nurse backed against the door and pushed it ajar , and through the tinny sound of television voices came a testy query , " What is it now ? " " You have another visitor . " " Kindly tell whoever it is to go away . Kindly tell him to go get stuffed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to go get stuffed . No , wait a second . Is she this dumpy bad-smelling thing with stringy mousy hair , wearing a too-small T-shirt and too-tight jeans ? " " It 's a tall brunette , the same one as ever . " " Send Doctor de Souza right in . I 'll tell her personally to go get stuffed . " The nurse winked broadly at Rene and moved out of the doorway . Rene composed herself , then peeked around the doorframe . Dick lay amid a thicket of intravenous tubes and connections to monitoring devices , - his wife , Judy , sat on the far side of the bed , holding his hand . The light coming through the opened blinds was cruel . Dick looked even more faded and . shrunken than he had on the occasion of her preceding visit , a mere four days earlier . Judy looked puffy and tired , as though she had slept badly . Probably she had , Rene decided as she rapped on the doorframe and said , " Are you decent ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . You two have met , have n't you ? " " I hope I 'm not intruding , " Rene said as she stepped into the room . Judy appeared not to know what to say , to fumble for words , for a moment that lasted just long enough to make Rene acutely uncomfortable . Judy was somewhat of an unknown quantity to Dick 's colleagues , - he had always kept his professional and domestic lives well apart from each other , with the result that Ren could not now be certain that she and Judy had said two dozen words to each other in as many years . She could not even recall when she had last seen Judy - the last time Dick had been in the hospital , or the time before , or the time before that ? Finally , Judy said , " Dick 's been talking back to the TV , but I 've lost track of the argument , " and fixed a smile on the lower half of her face . It only accentuated the sag of her jowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rene moved a chair close to the bed . She had always towered over Dick , but now , even seated , she thought he looked dwarfish . " Good thing you came now , " he said . " Later this afternoon I 'm scheduled to have my brain transplanted into the body of the Frankenstein monster . " " That would be a monster . " Rene looked across him at Judy and said , " Do n't ask me why , it 's nothing I can really put my finger on , but I strongly suspect he 's been giving the staff a hard time . " Judy worked on her smile . " The person at the desk got that look on her face when I asked how he was today . " " I know That Look . With two capital letters . " Between them , Dick growled . " What do you expect ? It 's not like I want to be here . You know , for what it 's cost for me to be here these past few days , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . " " Ah , " said Rene . " You 've heard the news . " He gestured at the television screen , at a man who stood behind a podium and addressed himself to the camera . " Got it straight from the man of the hour . " " - Roman poet Seneca , " the man of the hour was saying , " wrote that the fates lead the willing and drag the unwilling . He could have been writing about paradigm shifts . " " To hell with Seneca , then , " Dick said , " quote from Thomas goddamn Kuhn . Showoff . Overeducated schmuck . God , I hate physicists ! " " Dick , " Judy said , " you should n't let yourself get worked up . " " Hatred gives me strength , honey . " " Paradigm shifts , " the man of the hour went on , " are by definition unsettling . In fact , they can be downright scary . Back around the turn of the century , when I was an undergraduate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light to exceed the cosmic speed limit . Actually , they had done no such thing and had n't claimed to do any such thing . It was science reporters in the mainstream media who 'd misunderstood and misrepresented the facts . All the same , for just a moment or two , before reason kicked in , I felt the world tilt ninety degrees out of plumb . Everything I believed was wrong ! I experienced exactly the same kind of unease , almost a frisson of terror - and I know I speak for my fellow researchers , too - that moment of vertigo when we actually realized what we had , what we 'd stumbled onto - " " Hear that ? " Dick said . " " Stumbled onto/ He credits serendipity ! It was all luck ! He 's trying to sound modest . " " Modesty is a becoming trait , " Judy said , " even in a scientist . " " Especially in a scientist , " Rene said . " Hah . Any second now I expect to see him dig his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you can tell he knows he 's next year 's Nobel winner . And in the meantime he 'll be beating female grad students off with a stick . Or maybe male ones . Fruity bunch , physicists . It 's all Professor Schmucko there can do to keep from exploding with satisfaction . " " I ca n't say I blame him , " Rene said . " He 's entitled . It 's his time machine . " " It is n't a time machine . It 's a wormhole . " " Whatever it is , Dick , it 's too wonderful a thing for such a slimy-sounding name . " " You 're in the wrong line of work if slime upsets you . " " Oh , you know what I mean . They should call it a time warp , a space warp . Something - grand . Something science-fictiony . " " My distinct impression 's that they 're trying to make it sound as unscience-fictiony as they can . Anyway , what 's in a name ? " " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth implies the existence of a nether aperture . Hardly an image to encourage explorers . " " Hah . It wo n't discourage a single one . I bet the line at the Directorate of Geosciences already stretches clear around the block . You should be in it instead of here . " " I 'm there in spirit . Someone else is there in person . Do n't think for one second we 're going to miss out on this . " " Some of us are . " There was a moment of uncomfortable silence in the room . Finally , Rene asked , " How are you today ? " He grimaced , then worked the grimace into a tight smile . " I 'm how I was a mere four days ago , only more so . I 'm awful , thank you . Just bloody awful . I think this time is it . " Rene looked at Judy , who would not meet her eyes . She could read nothing in the woman 's expression , no clue as to how to proceed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here before you know it . Or : You must n't give up hope . Or : I wish you would n't talk that way . But she had said those things to him on previous occasions and knew that he expected better from her now . She said , " You know , you do n't always have to be the pessimist of the team . " " You angling for the position ? Feh . Amateur . Rene 'll deny this , honey , but deep down in her heart of hearts she always thinks the glass is half full . Me , I know it 's half empty . And dirty . And I 'm the one who 's going to have to wash it . " Judy said , " Dear , you do n't have to do your whole comedy routine for us . " " Speaking of comedy routines , " he asked Rene , " how did the conference go ? " Rene , grateful for the change of subject , said , " It went - it started out okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of the television screen " - and after that it just became impossible to get anyone to stick to the program . It devolved from a conference to a bacchanal . " " And probably stopped just short of a panty raid . In other words , nothing out of the ordinary . Paleo boys loose in the halls . Booze flowing like wine . Poolside furniture tossed into the deep end . Someone making a pass at Tetyana Pylpiv . Tetyana passing out from the shock . " " Basically . On the other hand - do you remember Caroline Warren ? " " Paleobotanist from Cornell . " For an instant , his eye sparkled mischievously . He turned his head toward his wife . " Redhead . Woof . " " See ? " Judy said quietly . " Plenty of life left in you yet , old dog . " " As soon as the news broke , " Rene went on , " and the implications started to sink in , Caroline Warren jumps up and says , " Screw this conference/ and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning - " " As the usual idiots are dragging around and comparing hangovers ! " " - she comes in with an entire study plan for determining the precise relationships of all those plants that 're always lumped together as Cooksonia . " Just give me one week in Paleozoic time , " she says . And of course she was all hot and bothered about some of the other specimens the probe brought back , the ones like nothing we 've ever seen before . " " I would join in the celebratory jig , " Dick said , " but under the circumstances .... " " Everyone sent regards and hopes you get well very soon . " " Ugh . Tell everyone for me , " Up yours very much . ' " He grimaced again , - this time , he let it remain a grimace . " I distinctly recall telling the head nurse to block all incoming regards and hopes . No flowers , no getwell cards . All visitors to be stripped and cavity-searched . All optimism , however guarded , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we even get points for meaning well ? " " I hate to disappoint everyone . But like I said , I think this is it . The disease 's led a merry chase all through me these last couple years . Bladder , lungs . Now it 's holed up inside my head where you could n't get at it with any instrument more delicate than an axe . " He glared suddenly at the television screen , which had bifurcated to show the man of the hour on the left , listening as an audience member on the right asked a question . " That 's enough of that crap , " Dick said , " now let me show you something really cool , " and when he spoke to the television screen an underwater scene instantly appeared . Shafts of sunlight slanted downward through green murk to illuminate patches of bottom mud . A shadowy form came swimming along just above the bottom , came headon , purposefully , straight toward the viewer . seemingly at the last moment , it turned sharply aside , affording Rene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the underside of the blunt head . A long , flattened appendage extended oar-like from each flank . Halfway along its length , the segmented body narrowed , terminating in an affair like a dirty ice pick . " Eurypterid , " she breathed . " E. remipes in the flesh , " he said , " or its kissing cousin , anyway . " " That is just incredible . " " Lucky it was n't one of the big eurypterids . Pterygotus would 've tried to eat their roboprobe . Have n't you seen this already ? " " Not this particular clip . " " Want to see it again ? Can you stand it ? " " Are you kidding ? " They watched the eurypterid a second time , and a third , in slow motion , and he told the television to freeze the image as the creature was halfway through its turn to the side , and to enlarge and enhance a particular section so that she could clearly see the underside of the head , the arrangement of the legs around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he let it swim on , and glowed with pleasure for a moment . Then his face clouded over again . " It moves , " he said , " just like your computer models . " " Our computer models . " " Do n't be generous . You did all the work . I began to die . " He told the television screen to go away , and it instantly blanked itself . " At the risk of sounding really really bitter , this is as close as I 'm ever going to get to going there , being there . " She took his free hand . It was cool in hers , the bones felt very fragile , and the blue veins showed prominently through the pale translucent skin . On the other side of the bed , fudy seemed intent on the hand she held . " A week ago , " Dick said , " I could 've died happy and at peace with the world . I mean that . I 'm tired and in pain all the time and I keep finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deity or other . " Since you are n't going to cure me , God or gods , could you please just kill me a bit faster ? " Do n't either of you dare tell anybody I got religion on my death bed . " " I swear on a stack of Bibles , " Rene said , " I would n't dream of it . " " Better not . I 'll find some way to haunt anyone who tells lies about me . Anyway , at least till my brain turns to gleet , I 've got to lie here and watch all this exciting stuff on television . Part of me 's thrilled , of course . But the part of me that 's dying , and it 's the part of me that gets bigger all the time , crowding out the other parts of me , that part feels cheated , big time . That part 's resentful as hell . That part of me feels like Tantalus in the old legend . In Hell he 's hungry and thirsty and food and water are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I seem to recall Tantalus was being punished for his sins . " " That 's what really pisses me off-it 's a bum rap . If there 's a God , I 'm going to kick his ass for this . Here I 'm coming up on the end of my life and after due reflection I 'm deciding it 's been a pretty good one . And then , suddenly , just out of reach , there 's the thing that makes everything I 've ever done pall . Time travel ! Goddamn time travel ! Brainboy on television 's going to be one of the immortals of science , everybody 'll get to jump through his wormhole , they 'll make important discoveries and win fame and glory . And guess who has to stay right here at home and be worm 's meat . " The women said , " Dick , " in unison and then looked at each other in embarrassment . " Oh , both of you , do n't look so goddamn stricken . I 'm the one who should look stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Paleozoic , and I ca n't go . I 'm not going anywhere from here . Well , to the hospice , for a while , then it 's off to the morgue . I was n't afraid of dying - as afraid of dying - before all this . I 'd already made it clear that no heroic measures are to be taken - what a stupid phrase ! Heroic measures ! Mock-heroic is more like it . But now I 'd be grabbing at straws if there were any straws to grab at . I do n't care what , untested drugs , yak dung extract . Anything as long as it promises recovery . No , not even recovery . Just a little more time . A year , six good months , so I , too , could go jump into that wormhole and see this prehistoric wonderland for myself . " Judy had let go of her husband 's hand . Now , as she reached for it again , Rene studied her expression and after a moment realized what it was : That Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and held in check by , resignation . She started as the big nurse filled the doorway behind her and said , " Sorry to interrupt - " Dick glowered at her past Rene . " What do you want now ? No , wait , just let me take a wild guess . It 's time for more unpleasantness , is n't it ? Fresh indignities against my person . " " Dick , " said Judy , " be nice . " " Why change my ways at this late date ? " Rene made a smile on her face and said to the nurse , " Allow me to apologize for my colleague 's rude behavior . It never used to be a problem when we kept him chained in the basement . " The nurse chuckled and advanced into the room , radiating a kind of genial purposefulness . " Perhaps his problem is he always was too healthy till now . Someone who 's never sick a day in their life does n't know how to behave when they do wind up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave anywhere . " The nurse chuckled again and said to Dick , " Now are you going to let her talk about you like that ? " " Rene , if you 're going to talk about me like that , please be a love and do it behind my back . " " Well , " said the nurse , " I 'm afraid visiting hours are over . " " Sorry , " Judy said , " I - we lost track of the time . " Rene stood . " I 'll see you tomorrow , Dick , if I can get away . " He effected part of a shrug . " You only have to bother with me as long as I remain lucid . Tell everybody to be brave . " Judy said , " We all have to be brave , do n't we ? " and leaned over the bed to kiss his cheek , near the corner of his mouth . Rene patted his hand in farewell . " Do n't make life too hard for these nice nurses . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered around the nurse 's bulging flank as she insinuated herself between visitors and bed . " If I only yelled at people I 'm really mad at - life 's too short for that degree of discrimination . " " Be good . Till tomorrow . " Judy stood no taller than Dick ; as the two women walked slowly toward the elevators , Rene could not help hunching her shoulders and stooping slightly in an effort to compensate for the disparity in their heights . Judy glanced up at her and said , " He always did describe you as his tallest , slimmest , and most limbful colleague . " Rene started to laugh , but then Judy added , " I feel like such a dumpling , waddling along beside you . Well , thank you for coming to see him . I 'm sure you must be very busy with that - that time-travel business or whatever it is . " " Whatever it is , it is pretty exciting , is n't it ? If I do n't get on the team that goes through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm sure it wo n't . " " But , meanwhile - if there 's anything I can do to help , anything any of us can do - " " Yes . There is something . " " Dick is just - there 's nothing we would n't do for him . " " I 'm sure . Everyone tells me how much they 've always liked and admired him . " They arrived before the elevator doors , and Judy dug a handkerchief from her purse . Her eyelashes glistened wetly . As she daubed at her eyes , she said , " If you want to know the truth , sometimes I have a hard time remembering him when he was likeable and admirable . You see how he 's becoming extremely difficult to be with . Well , he 's ill . And he 's full of anger and self-pity . Anyway . I started thinking about what I have to say before you came . When he was watching television . I 've never been good at talking to people . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade into the wallpaper . But now I 'm having to step into the foreground and take charge of everything , and it leaves me wide open for his famous caustic wit . The less of a sense of humor he has , the more caustic what he does have becomes . I go home in tears after every visit . But I guess a sense of humor 's a lot to expect from a dying man . Especially one with a brain tumor . Anyway . I 'd be very grateful if , from now on , you would downplay work when you come to see him . Particularly if it involves this new discovery . " " Well , I 'm - " The elevator doors slid open , and they stepped inside and rode down in silence with three other people . In the lobby , udy drew Rene to one side , out of the way of traffic , and said , " You saw how excited he is . It 's not good for him . He needs rest and quiet from now on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a lifetime of valuable work to look back on . That ought to satisfy him . It ought to satisfy all of you . For all these years , I 've had to share him with you . It was more like I had him on loan from you , when I did have him . When he was off in Australia or Antarctica , or even just off to a conference , I was at home with the children and my half of the bed . We were only his family - his real rapport was with his colleagues and with things that died millions of years ago . Well , now he does n't have much time left . I want as much of that time as I can have . If I 'm being horribly selfish , I 'm sorry , I ca n't help it . But I am claiming my rights as his wife . " Judy turned abruptly and left . Numbly , dumbly , Ren stood and watched her go , then , after the better part of a minute , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could without breaking into a run . She was okay until she had come within arm 's reach of her car . Then she felt as though all warmth had flowed from her , suddenly , in an instant , to disperse in some vast dark void . Her legs went rubbery . She staggered against the car , clutched desperately with both hands at its smooth surfaces . " Open the door , " she said , and sounded thin and tremulant to herself , and when the car hesitated , she yelled , almost screamed , " Open the damn door ! " and the door opened , and she got in . The car said , " Please fasten your seatbelt . " She gripped the steering wheel and pressed her forehead against the backs of her hands . Her hands felt cold ; her face felt hot . " Please fasten your seatbelt . " She flung herself back in her seat , pummeled the steering wheel with her fists . She could not see for tears . Her fist collided with something less yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elbow . She clutched the throbbing hand to herself , curled around it . " Please fasten - " " I know . Shut up . " She blindly fumbled with the seatbelt until she heard the click of the buckle . Then she wiped her eyes with her fingers and glared at the dashboard . " There , " she gasped . " Happy ? " THE BLUEJACKETS HELPED Rene and Tim pitch camp above the slope and tested the radio for them , and then she expressed her gratitude to the United States Navy and said , " see you in six weeks . " The Navy man in charge said , " Happy collecting , " and led the detail back down the slope to the waiting boat . Watching them pick their way through the rubble , Tim sighed and shook his head . " Six whole weeks without cute sailors . " " You 've always got me , big boy . " " Sorry . For starters , you 're way too tall for me . " " You men . But at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim turned and surveyed the rocky jumble of the island . " Not that we came for the scenery , of course , but the view 's scarcely worth all the effort we put into coming up . " " You 'll feel better after you 've collected a scorpion sting or two . Well . Shall we go ahead and get it over with ? " " Please , let 's . " Tim produced a metal canister from his backpack and set it on the ground . " I ca n't tell you what a relief it 'll be not to have a dead man on my hands . I 'm temperamentally unsuited for grave robbing . " " We did n't rob a grave , Tim . " " I 'm also temperamentally unsuited for smuggling . We have , broken the rules . " " I appreciate your help . " " For chrissake , Rene . It 's Dick . I would n't have done it for just anybody , you know . " " Me , either . " She unfolded the blade of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gritty earth . When she had finished , Tim handed her the metal canister . She gripped it firmly with both hands while he unscrewed and removed its cap . Then they knelt together over the hole , and he said , " Do you want to say something first ? " " I 've been wondering all along what to say . All I 've ever come up with is some lines from Housman . And an apology , I guess . " Sorry it took us so long to get you here , Dick . " Ah , Tim . I never once told him I loved him . It just never occurred to me to say it in all those years we worked together . Then , at the end , I was made to feel I did n't have the right to say it . I did n't want to intrude . " " I 'm sure he must have known . You two were best buds . Inseparables . There were rumors . " " That 's all they ever were , just rumors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . " " To the best of my knowledge , he was absolutely faithful to his wife . " " Beats me how . " " Not nice , Tim . " " Well , maybe not , but even so . " " She was his wife . " After a long moment , Rene added , " She just was n't his first love . What a terrible thing , to be shut out like that . He felt cheated by fate , but she felt cheated by him . " She carefully upended the canister and poured its ashy contents into the hole . Then she recited : <p> " Nice , " said Tim , " in a singsong kind of way . Housman , eh ? " " I would 've recited it at the memorial service , but she was there , in full possession of the event , so to speak . I did n't want to make her resent us - resent me even more than she already did . " Tim waited a moment before taking the canister from her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole . When she had finished , he said , " Well , that 's that , at long damn last . " " After he died , someone suggested talking to the widow about bringing his ashes through the time portal and burying them here . I said , " You 'll never wring that concession from her . ' " " I 'm surprised her children went for the idea . I 'd 've thought she'd 've turned them against us . " " No , it was their wish . The whole time he was dying , they had to listen to him rant about not getting to come through the time portal . So they let Mom keep him on the mantelpiece . After she was gone , they brought him to me , and now I 've brought him here . " " So she was happy , and now they 're happy , too . Maybe she 's still happy , now that she 's got him for all eternity , if there is an eternity . " Tim looked around in the failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his island . " She smiled wanly .
