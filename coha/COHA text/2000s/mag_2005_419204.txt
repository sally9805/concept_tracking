NIGHT BY NIGHT during August , the bright planet Jupiter is getting lower in the western sky . But it 's still quite accessible during the early evening hours . On almost any night , skywatchers with small telescopes can expect to view interesting phenomena involving the Galilean moons and their interactions with Jupiter or its shadow . Several are depicted below , and the full list can be found on the next page . Observers in any given country will be able to see only some of them in a dark sky . Only Io , Europa , and Ganymede can currently pass in front of or behind the disk of Jupiter . The planes of the moons ' orbits are tilted about 3 to Jupiter 's orbit , and wide-ranging Callisto misses the planet 's disk and shadow , as seen from Earth , until 2008 . The first panel below shows a conjunction of Europa and Callisto at 1:53 Universal Time on August 3rd , which is 9:53 p.m . Eastern Daylight Time on August 2nd in North America . This conjunction wo n't last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its orbit moving west , while Callisto is on the far side of its orbit moving east . The moons are four Jupiter diameters west of Jupiter 's center and are 21 ' ' ' apart . // Shown below for several dates and times are particularly interesting configurations of the moons ; north is up . // The next panel shows Io reappearing from an eclipse by Jupiter 's shadow at 1:47 UT on August 5th ( 9:47 p.m . EDT on the 4th ) . Even though Io moves out of the shadow more quickly than the other moons , the process is still gradual . You might notice the first speck of ID 'S light a minute earlier . // At right , the curving lines represent Jupiter 's four bright satellites . Jupiter itself is the center vertical bar . Each horizontal band represents a full day , from 0sup h ( upper edge of band ) to 24h Universal Time . The date is given at left . East is left and west is right to match the view from the Northern Hemisphere in binoculars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDT the previous night ) , Io 's shadow will be leaving the disk of Jupiter . As shown in the third panel , Io itself is already well clear of the disk , having finished its transit exactly an hour earlier . Jupiter 's departure from the evening sky coincides with the return of Saturn before dawn . For those of us living at midnorthern latitudes , the ringed planet rises during twilight at the start of August but 2 hours ahead of the Sun at month 's end . The chart at right will help in identifying Sth-magnitude Titan and perhaps a few other moons on any given morning . Like the rings , the orbits of the inner moons are tipped 20 from edge-on as seen from Earth this month . // Phenomena of Jupiter 's Moons , August 2005 Above , The curving lines represent Saturn 's brightest moons . The planet 's disk and rings are indicated by vertical bands . Each horizontal band represents a full day , from 0sup h to 24sup h Universal Time . Titan is the easiest moon to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tethys . Enceladus may need a 300-mm . The wavy-line chart gives only east-west shifts . Refer to the ellipses at top to estimate each moon 's location north of ( above ) or south of the ring extension . // Visit SkyandTelescope.com and click on Observing &gt; Celestial Objects &gt; Planets to find handy applets that display the configurations of Jupiter 's and Saturn 's moons at any given time . - ROGER W.
