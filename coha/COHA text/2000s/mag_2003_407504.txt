// Dear Dr. Cory : Why is it that when I am sick , the food I eat tastes weird ? Samantha Maywald Texas Dear Samantha : Your sense of smell plays an important role in helping you to taste . When your nose gets plugged up from an illness , mucus may cover the smell receptors in your nose and block your sense of smell . This changes the way things taste to you . Dear Dr. Cory : We all know that the flu goes around each year at least twice . But every single time I seem to get it more than twice and a whole lot more than anyone I know . The trouble is that I 'm afraid of needles . Consequently , I have missed two flu shots . Is this as bad or dangerous as my mom says it is ? // Send your health questions to " Ask Doctor Cory , " Children 's Digest , P.O.

The flu virus can be very dangerous , particularly for very young children , older adults , and people with chronic diseases such as asthma . We ca n't think of anyone who likes getting a shot or being stuck with a needle . However , to help prevent many serious diseases and sometimes to give important medications , shots are necessary . When you need a shot , such as the flu shot , try not to watch as the nurse prepares it . Often , if you talk or joke with others in the room or focus on an object that forces you to look in the opposite direction , the shot will be over before you realize it . You can also try blowing , like you are blowing bubbles , as the shot is being given . Researchers have found that this blowing action makes shots less painful . It also seems to be helpful for other short periods of pain . You might try it the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to any healthy child six months of age or older .

How can I get rid of them ? Regina Fuller New York Dear Regina : White spots on the nails are very common . They are from an injury to the base of the nail where the nail cells are made . As your mom says-sort of like a bruise . They are harmless and will gradually grow out as your nail grows . Dear Dr. Cory : Is Jt true when people say " an apple a day keeps the doctor away ? " Ki m e-mail Dear Kim : Scientists are discovering the many reasons why apples help to keep the doctor away . A medium apple has only about 60 calories , no fat , and five grams of fiber ... more than a bowl of bran cereal . Apples also contain naturally occurring chemicals known as phytochemicals , polyphenols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cancer , heart disease , and strokes . And an apple-rich diet has been found to help reduce blood-cholesterol levels . Many of these important chemicals are found in the apple skin , so you get the most nutrients if you do n't peel your apple . A recent study found that overweight women who ate 300 grams of apples or pears-about three small fruits a day-lost more weight on a low-calorie diet than women who did n't add fruit to their diet . Apples should be an important part of a healthy diet that includes at least five fruits and vegetables a day-three to five vegetables and two to four fruit servings . It really is not that hard to do when a large banana or apple , a cup of broccoli , or medium-sized salad each counts as two servings. // Dear Dr. Cory : My brother walks on his toes at the age of six . According to my mom 's medical books , he was supposed to stop walking on his toes by the age of three . Please write me back and let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of seeing him walk on his toes ! Ashley Ramsey Pennsylvania Dear Ashley : Toe-walking can result from a shortened Achilles tendon ( heel cord ) to more serious neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy .
