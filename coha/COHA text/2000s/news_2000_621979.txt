<p> The smell of money has a new scent these days in the cavernous , mostly windowless Casino San Pablo , where the coins clink and the cards shuffle ' round the clock in an eternally sunless day . <p> It is the scent of anticipation  --  of big changes coming soon and the promise of big , big money . <p> The passage last week of Proposition 1A opened the doors to an explosion in Indian gaming in California , and ground zero in the Bay Area is expected to be San Pablo 's little-known gambling hall . <p> The Lytton band of Pomo Indians is close to sealing a deal to take over the casino  --  and once that happens , 1,000 slot machines and a cornucopia of Las Vegas-style games , from blackjack to craps , will sprout under its faux Moroccan roof faster than you can say " jackpot . " <p> This instantly will create the undisputed king of Northern California gambling palaces , right in the heart of the Bay Area . It also will create the most urban Indian casino in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers . <p> Critics of casino gambling in California are appalled at the prospect of people betting away their paychecks or falling prey to alcoholism and the other ills that can happen when the lure of riches collides with weak impulses . <p> But such fears do not wash with the Lytton band , a struggling tribe of 217 people based in Santa Rosa with no land to call their own . Or with the city manager of San Pablo , long one of the most impoverished towns in the Bay Area . <p> The casino-expansion plan , which they hope to have sewn up by the end of 2000 , is a godsend , they crow . <p> " It ca n't happen soon enough for us , " said City Manager Rory Robinson . " We try not to even think about it until it happens , because you can drive yourself nuts , but let me just say this : <p> " This deal would be fantastic for the city of San Pablo , period . " <p> The tribe needs money to buy a new homeland in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people . Hooking up to a money pump like Casino San Pablo  --  which last year raked in $17.2 million  --  would fill that need and more , said tribal Chairwoman Margie Mejia . <p> The Lyttons were stripped of federal recognition four decades ago in a huge Indian relocation effort , and when they won back their tribal status in 1990 , their land was no longer available . If the tribe 's application to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to acquire the casino goes through , it would , in essence , make the casino its reservation , although few if any of them would actually live there . <p> " We wanted to find land where we could have a casino to provide the needed revenue , " Mejia said . " We also wanted to go where we knew we would be welcome . " <p> As she found out , when it comes to her plan , that the word " welcome " in San Pablo is an understatement . In 1994 , 66 percent of city voters approved the original casino , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyttons inside city limits . <p> The tribe decided San Pablo was its future on the advice of Philadelphia sports-team dealmaker Sam Katz , whom the band hired in the mid-1990s to get it started in gaming . <p> Katz , who narrowly lost the Philadelphia mayoral race last fall , first steered the tribe toward a casino site in American Canyon in Napa County . That plan was promptly batted down in public hearings . Then , Katz was driving by San Pablo on Interstate 80 and saw the huge casino sign beckoning  --  and he pulled off to investigate . <p> It turned out the owner , London gambling conglomerate Ladbroke USA , was already trying to sell many of its American holdings , which included the Golden Gate Fields horse-racing track in Albany . By December 1998 , the tribe signed a sales agreement for an undisclosed amount . Last November , the formal application to put the casino into tribal land trust went to the Bureau of Indian Affairs . <p> " With the sort of support they have from the city and the company they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things going very smoothly , " said Dale Risling , superintendent of the bureau 's Central California Agency . Such approvals , which eventually must be signed by the bureau 's Washington , D.C. , headquarters , often take up to two years , " but one year is n't out of the question in this case , " Risling said . <p> No California tribe has ever purchased an existing casino and registered it as a new reservation . <p> " Ladbroke and the casino are very excited about this deal , " said Sally Hogarty , spokewoman for Casino San Pablo , who defers most comments to Mejia . " We ca n't wait . " <p> Ladbroke sold Golden Gate Fields last year . <p> The Lytton pact is all people talk about in the casino , a gaudy , 10-acre compound thus far known mostly to locals and gambling aficionados . <p> " The sooner that tribe takes over , the better , " said 64-year-old David Herrera , sitting at the seven-card-stud table at 10 a.m. on a weekday morning , a $120 pot placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cards is fine , but there 's nothing like a good slot machine . We need slots , so I do n't have to drive to Reno to find them . " <p> Because Indians under Proposition 1A are not constrained by the same gambling laws as the rest of California , the Lyttons would be able to run any kind of wager imaginable . The current card room is limited to a handful of games . <p> Gambling critics say a Nevada-style hall open day and night , as Casino San Pablo is , will suck people into tragedy , and no financial help to the city can justify that . <p> " Slot machines are the crack cocaine of gambling , incredibly addictive , " said Cheryl Schmit of Stand Up for California , an anti-gambling group based near Sacramento . " When people lose money like that , you see more spousal abuse , poverty , alcoholism . It 's always a disaster . " <p> The city has already had five years to get used to life with a casino , and Robinson said it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo , population 26,000 , is a blue-collar backwater hidden on the northern edge of Richmond in Contra Costa County . It hit the tank when the shipyards that fueled its workforce went bust after World War II . Until gambling came along , it was known mainly for ramshackle housing and junk food along San Pablo Avenue , the wide street that connects it to the rest of the East Bay . Its average household income , $41,000 , is the Bay Area 's lowest . <p> Then on Dec. 15 , 1995 , Ladbroke opened its $31 million specimen of card-room opulence to great fanfare , right on San Pablo Avenue , and things have never been the same . <p> One councilman cracked that with its gold-and-maroon turrets and swirling stucco walls , the casino looked " like a Moroccan whorehouse , " and it was not meant as an insult . Opening day featured a 7-foot-1 doorman dressed like Ali Baba , and local bigwigs arrived in a limousines to cavort amid ice sculptures and jazz music . <p> In the first full fiscal year , 1996- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , constituting 42 percent of San Pablo 's budget  --  and saving the city from bankruptcy . City leaders quickly set about repaving potholed roads , hiring new police , revitalizing shopping centers and starting recreation programs for children s and seniors . <p> The boom tapered off after the initial rush , and last year the cash infusion shrank to $1.9 million , or 25 percent of the town budget . But nobody in City Hall is complaining . <p> " This card room has already transformed this city , and even if the tribe deal did not happen , it is still a vital revenue source for us , " said Robinson . " It can only get better with the Lyttons . " <p> The tentative agreement with the Lyttons promises up to $5 million a year to the city  --  $1.5 million in fees , plus 5 1/4 percent of casino revenues , which would come to at least $3.5 million under city projections . The fee and profit-sharing arrangement would be in lieu of the current property , sales and gaming taxes , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not subject to such levies . <p> " It could hardly be more perfect , " Robinson said . " The Lytton band is displaced with no land , and it ends up making its home in one of the poorest towns in the Bay Area . It would mean big things for both of us . We would be saving each other .
