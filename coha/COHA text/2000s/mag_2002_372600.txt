When reviewers compare new artists with established ones , it 's often not because they lack adjectives . It 's probably because the new artists lack originality . So let 's just say that hot-selling R.-and-B. singer Ashanti , 19 , combines the hip-hop delivery of Mary J. Blige with the modulated control of Alicia Keys . Both are fine singers to emulate , but Ashanti needs to find her own voice . It does n't help that the album 's breakout hit , Foolish , is built around El DeBarge 's keyboard sample from Stay With Me , a sample made famous by the Notorious B.I.G . on his signature hit One More Chance . <P>  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
