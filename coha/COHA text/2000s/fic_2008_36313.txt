" You 're firing me ? " <br> The morning light filtering into Dr. Johnson 's no-nonsense office through the tinted windows suddenly seemed glaringly bright . The typical sounds surrounding the students ' arrival at school  --  chatter , laughter , the occasional shout , the squeak of sneakers on industrial tile  --  were too loud . Even the office 's blandness seemed unusually depressing  --  the standard-issue faux-cherry executive desk , the fussy gold lamp , the blotter trimmed with leather , framed prints of soulless pastel sailboats hanging on the wall . <br> Dr. Johnson sighed heavily and set her pen on the desk . Up until a moment ago , when she 'd informed me I was losing my job , I 'd always liked the principal of Andrews Prep . I 'd found her capable , smart , tough , and fair-minded . I was now quickly changing my mind . <br> " I do n't see that I have any choice , " she said . <br> Dr. Johnson was fifty years old  --  the staff had thrown her a surprise birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gorgeous , slow-to-age black skin that made her look ten years younger . She was a tall , broad-shouldered woman with closely cropped hair and dark , serious eyes . She wore one of the brightly colored suits she favored , this one a mustard yellow with big black buttons down the front . <br> " Of course you have a choice ! " I said , my temper rising up out of the muffled fog of shock . <br> Dr. Johnson pursed her lips and looked levelly at me . " We take accusations of sexual misconduct most seriously here at Andrews Prep . " <br> " Sexual misconduct ? " I could feel the heat in my face , suddenly flaming with anger and outrage . " You know I did n't do anything of the kind ! Matt must have made up this ridiculous story in retaliation for the failing grade I gave him last week ! " <br> I had taught English literature at Andrews Prep for the past ten years . Matt Forrester  --  who was lazy , jaded , smugly self-entitled  --  was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't do the work ; he chose not to , preferring to spend the time when he was n't in school or at soccer practice getting stoned with his friends . He had n't read any of the books I 'd assigned for class this year and the previous week had failed a test on William Thackeray 's Vanity Fair , bringing his current grade down to a solid D. <br> Andrew Prep 's policy of not allowing a student to participate in extracurricular activities unless they maintained at least a 2.5 grade point average meant that Matt had been automatically suspended from the soccer team . Two days earlier , he 'd stopped by my classroom after school to argue about his grade and , when that did n't work , begged for a chance to retake the test or do extra-credit work . I 'd refused . <br> Matt had stared at me with indolent blue eyes that drooped slightly at the outer corners . I knew many of the girls at school thought he was good-looking , with his long dirty-blond hair and fine-boned features that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attraction . I thought Matt 's sneering bad-boy act was a bore . <br> " You 'll be sorry , " Matt had said . He 'd practically spit the words at me , sounding too much like a toddler on the verge of a temper tantrum to be genuinely intimidating . <br> " Good-bye , Matt , " I 'd said , dismissing him . I had n't taken his threat seriously . Most of the students at Andrews Prep were good kids , but it was n't unheard of for one of the more spoiled ones to fall back on the old favorite from time to time : Wait until my father hears about this ! <br> This time , the threat apparently had teeth . <br> Dr. Johnson cleared her throat and looked down at a yellow lined tablet on which she 'd jotted notes . I knew she did n't really need to refer to them to remember the details and was doing so only to avoid eye contact with me . <br> " Matthew Forrester states that when he petitioned you to change his grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to come to your classroom after school on Monday . He complied with your request . He claims that you then made a sexually inappropriate comment about the pants he was wearing , saying that you liked the way his "  --  Dr. Johnson paused and cleared her throat again  --  " buttocks looked in them . " <br> " What ? " I exclaimed . " That 's insane ! I did n't say that ! " <br> " He states that you told him you 'd fantasized about having an affair with a student . He claims you then offered to change his grade to an A if he would have sexual intercourse with you , " Dr. Johnson said . She folded her hands together , resting them on her desk , and looked at me again . " We only have his uncorroborated accusation that this happened . I 'm assuming you deny these charges . " <br> " Of course I deny them ! " <br> I was practically shouting , but I did n't care . If ever there was a time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and for the first time since I 'd arrived for our meeting  --  I 'd been summoned first thing , mere moments after I 'd arrived at school that morning  --  I saw a crack in her stony , **25;1749;TOOLONG facade . She looked tired and , I thought , regretful . <br> " As I know you 're well aware , Andrews Prep has a strict no-tolerance sexual harassment policy , " she began . <br> " But I did n't sexually harass Matt ! Or anyone else , for that matter ! " <br> The truth of this was so obvious . I would never hit on one of my students . They 're children . Even those who 'd managed to shed their gawky adolescent bodies for the wider shoulders and hairy jaws of manhood still had the hearts and minds of children . The very idea that I 'd be attracted to one of them , much less act on such an attraction , was laughable . <br> " Do you really think I would do something like that ? " I demanded . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about what 's best for this institution . And we simply can not take the risk of having someone who 's been accused of this sort of behavior around our students , " Dr. Johnson said . <br> I stared at her , feeling sullied by the accusation . Panic began to rise up inside me , closing my throat and constricting my chest . <br> I drew in a deep breath and tried to keep my voice as calm as possible . " I 've taught at this school for ten years . In that time I 've had an exemplary record . Two years ago I was named Teacher of the Year . I have a plaque , for God 's sake . And now because one troubled and angry boy , who told me I 'd regret it if I did n't change his lousy grade , has made up a ridiculous and , frankly , slanderous accusation against me , just like that , I 'm fired ? " <br> Dr. Johnson was quiet for a few minutes . I felt an irrational spike of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hope that was quashed a moment later when she finally spoke . <br> " Mr. and Mrs. Forrester came to see me yesterday . They 're very disturbed by their son 's claims . But they 've agreed not to take any further legal action against you or against Andrews Prep if we agreed to terminate your employment . " <br> Realization dawned , and suddenly it was all brutally clear . The Forresters were wealthy , even by Andrews Prep standards . Owen Forrester owned several car dealerships . His wife , Cassie , sat on every high-profile charity board in town . <br> " So that 's it , is it ? " I asked . " The Forresters have been the biggest contributors to the school for  --  what is it now ?  --  three years running ? I guess money counts more than the truth . " <br> Dr. Johnson did n't reply . But her silence was as good as an admission . The horror of what was happening fully hit me . I was losing my job  --  no , it was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ever hire a teacher with this sort of blemish on her record ? It was the only career I 'd ever wanted , and now . . . now it was gone forever . My lungs emptied and my stomach clenched so painfully that it took all of my willpower not to double over . <br> " Please do n't do this to me , " I whispered , shaking my head . " Please . " <br> " I 'm sorry , " Dr. Johnson said . And although she really did sound sorry , her voice held a note of irrevocable finality . <br> It was absolutely gorgeous out  --  a perfect Florida early-autumn morning . The sky was a cloudless azure blue , and the temperature was a balmy seventy-five degrees . I felt betrayed by this idyllic weather . Bad news should summon equally moody weather : steel-gray skies , chill winds , foreboding cracks of thunder , sleet . <br> My feelings vacillated between numb disbelief and violent shocks of rage that left my hands shaking . I did n't bother going to my classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . I was n't even sure if I would be allowed to go back there . Should n't there be a security guard standing by , ready to escort me from the school ? But there was n't . Instead , I walked out past the school secretary , who was too busy talking to a harried mother dropping off a forgotten sack lunch to notice me , through the office door , past the few students still lingering in the hallway , even though the first bell had already rung , and out into the dazzling sunshine . <br> My feet seemed to be moving on their own , propelling me toward my ancient yellow Volvo parked in the teachers ' lot . I loved my car , even though it was old , temperamental , and rarely had a repair bill under one thousand dollars . At least it was always easy to pick out in a sea of taupe sedans and black SUVs . It was a running joke among both the faculty and student body of Andrews Prep that the teachers ' lot looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students ' lot , which more closely resembled a luxury-car dealership , full of Mercedeses , BMWs , and the ever-popular Lexus SUV . One student even drove a Bentley , a hand-me-down from her dad when he upgraded . <br> I never locked my Volvo , figuring no car thief in his right mind would bother with it , so I opened my car door without having to fumble for my keys and climbed in . I sat there for a long time , my hands gripping the steering wheel , my PBS telethon canvas tote bag still hanging on my shoulder . I looked in the rearview mirror once and was startled by what I saw there : My face , usually a pinkish ivory , had blanched to a sickly shade of chalk white , my brown eyes were sunken , the dark corkscrew curls I always struggled to control seemed even wilder than usual . I quickly looked away . <br> A car pulled in a few spots down from me . I glanced over and saw Mel Hutchinson , the terminally late biology teacher . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefcase , I hunched as far down in my seat as possible , hoping he would n't notice me . <br> Hurry up , I urged him silently . If he turned and saw me , he 'd almost certainly stop and ask me why I was sitting there . It was a conversation I deperately did n't want to have . Not now , and certainly not with him . <br> Once Mel finally walked off toward the school , I started the old Volvo , backed out of my spot , and pulled out of the parking lot , the tires spinning on the gravel . I did n't know where to go . Not home . Elliott would n't be there  --  he 'd told me he would be showing houses to a young newlywed couple all morning  --  and I did n't feel like being alone . I thought about heading to the bookstore , where I could buy an overpriced caffeinated drink and be soothed among the stacks of books . But then , glancing at the clock , I realized it was only eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Who gets fired before eight in the morning ? I wondered . It seemed like an event that should take place over lunch or after the workday was over . Not so early in the day that stores had n't yet opened . <br> Maisie , I thought , and impulsively pointed the car toward my best friend 's house . <br> Maisie and I had been friends since her family had moved into the house next door to mine the summer before seventh grade . I 'd shyly gone out to meet her when I saw Maisie standing in her driveway , straddling her bicycle as she watched the movers unload her family 's possessions off the truck . I liked the look of her immediately . She was wiry and small , with short strawberry-blond hair and an impish , freckled face . We were instant friends in the way that 's possible only when you 're young and had remained close through our school years and beyond . <br> Maisie was now a stay-at-home mom to her twin three-year-old boys , Gus and Leo ( short for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get everyone dressed and out of the house before ten o'clock , I thought there was a good chance she 'd be home . <br> It took me five minutes to drive over to the new subdivision where Maisie and her family lived in a small three-bedroom house . All of the houses on Maisie 's street were identical and packed close together in tight , precise rows . I pulled into her driveway , narrowly missing a faded red plastic tricycle lying on its side , and climbed out of my car . My legs felt stiff beneath me , as though my body had aged on the short drive over . <br> I could hear sounds of chaotic life inside the house while I was still five steps away from the front door . One of the twins was crying , the other was shouting something , and their dog , a Jack Russell terrier named Fang , was yapping loudly over the cacophony . I had to ring the doorbell twice before anyone heard it . <br> " Lucy ! " Maisie said when she finally answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms and one of Joe 's white V-necked Ts  --  and already looked exhausted . She had n't changed all that much since the first time I saw her . She had the same slim angular body , almost unchanged by puberty and pregnancy , the same short fluff of red-blond hair , the same pretty freckled face . Even though I was n't an especially tall woman  --  five-five in my stocking feet  --  I always felt like a giantess next to tiny Maisie . Fang sprang out the door from behind her , leaping toward me , his stubby little tail wagging furiously . <br> " Hi , Maisie . Hey , Fang , " I said faintly . I leaned over to pet the Jack Russell on his head , and he lunged at my hand , licking it in a frenzied display of delight . <br> Maisie 's smile of greeting quickly faded , and her face quirked into a frown . <br> " What 's wrong ? You look awful . Why are you here ? Come on , come inside , I 'll get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words without pausing for breath . <br> In what seemed like one motion , Maisie pulled me inside the house , closed the door , and slipped the tote bag off my shoulder . Her house was , as usual , a disaster zone . The debris of family life  --  toy trains , cars , puzzles , action figures , books , T-shirts , shoes , tissues , Fang 's chew toys  --  was scattered everywhere . There was a bench along the wall in the hallway , presumably a place for putting on or taking off your shoes , but it was covered in bags , toys , coloring books , and a megasize package of disposable Pull-Ups , rendering it impossible to sit on . <br> Maisie steered me back to the light-filled , noisy kitchen at the rear of the house . It , too , was a mess . Several of the white laminate cupboards and drawers were half open , dirty dishes were stacked in the sink , cereal boxes and apple-juice containers were spread across the counters next to a messy stack of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin . <br> The twins were sitting at the table in matching booster chairs , taking turns blowing loud raspberries at each other and laughing raucously . Whatever storm had caused the upset I 'd heard while ringing the doorbell had apparently already blown over . The boys had their father 's dark hair and hazel eyes but had inherited their mother 's playful , mischievous personality . <br> Continues ...
