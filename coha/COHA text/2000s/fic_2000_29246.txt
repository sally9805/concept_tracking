Clara Rinker . Of the three unluckiest days in Barbara Allen 's life , the first was the day Clara Rinker was raped behind a St. Louis nudie bar called Zanadu , which was located west of the city in a dusty checkerboard of truck terminals , warehouses and light assembly plants . Zanadu , as its chrome-yellow I-70 billboard proclaimed , was E-Z On , E-Z Off . The same was not true of Clara Rinker , despite what Zanadu 's customers thought . Rinker was sixteen when she was raped , a small athletic girl , a dancer , an Ozarks runaway . She had bottle-blond hair that showed darker roots , and a body that looked wonderful in V-necked , red-polka-dotted , thin cotton dresses from Kmart . A body that drew the attention of cowboys , truckers and other men who dreamt of Nashville . Rinker had taken up nude dancing because she could . It was that , fuck for money or go hungry . The rape took place at two o'clock in the morning on an otherwise delightful April night , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out late and play war , when cicadas hum down from their elm-bark hideaways . Rinker had closed the bar that night ; she was the last dancer up . Four men were still drinking when she finished . Three were hound-faced long-distance truckers who had nowhere to go but the short beds in their various Kenworths , Freightliners and Peterbilts ; and one was a Norwegian exotic-animal dealer drowning the sorrows of a recent mishap involving a box of boa constrictors and thirty-six thousand dollars ' worth of illegal tropical birds . A fifth man , a slope-shouldered gorilla named Dale-Something , had walked out of the bar halfway through Rinker 's last grind . He left behind twelve dollars in crumpled ones and two small sweat rings where his forearms had been propped on the bar . Rinker had worked down the bar-top , stopping for ten seconds in front of each man for what the girls called a crack shot . Dale-Something had gotten the first shot , and he had stood up and walked out as soon as she moved to the next guy . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar and headed for the back to get into her street clothes . A few minutes later , the bartender , a University of Missouri wrestler named Rick , knocked on the dressing room door and said , " Clara ? Will you close up the back ? " " I 'll get it , " she said , pulling a fuzzy pink tube top over her head , shaking her ass to get it down . Rick respected the dancers ' privacy , which they appreciated ; it was purely a psychological thing , since he worked behind the bar , and spent half his night looking up their ... Anyway , he respected their privacy . When she was dressed , Rinker killed the lights in the dressing room , walked down to the ladies ' room , checked to make sure it was empty , which it always was , and then did the same for the men 's room , which was also empty , except for the ineradicable odor of beer-flavored urine . At the back door , she snapped out the hall lights , released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft evening air . She pulled the door shut , heard the bolt snap , rattled the door handle to make sure that it was locked and headed for her car . A rusted-out Dodge pickup crouched on the lot , two-thirds of the way down to her car . A battered aluminum camper slumped on the back , with curtains tangled in the windows . Every once in a while , somebody would drink too much and would wind up sleeping in his car behind the place ; so the truck was not exactly unprecedented . Still , Rinker got a bad vibe from it . She almost walked back around the building to see if she could catch Rick before he went out the front . Almost . But that was too far and she was probably being silly and Rick was probably in a hurry and the truck was dark , nothing moving ... Dale-Something was sitting on the far side of it , hunkered down in the pea gravel , his back against the driver's-side door . He 'd been waiting for twenty minutes with decreasing patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the deep recesses of his mind , breath mints were a concession to gentility , as regarded women . He chewed them as a favor to her . When he heard the back door closing , he levered his butt off the ground , peeked through a car window , saw her coming , alone . He waited , crouched behind the car : he was a big guy , much of his bigness in fat , but he took pride in his size anyway . And he was quick : Rinker never had a chance . When she stepped around the truck , keys rattling in her hand , he came out of the dark and hit her like an NFL tackle . The impact knocked her breath out ; she lay beneath him , gasping , the gravel cutting her bare shoulders . He flipped her over , twisting her arms , clamping both of her skinny wrists in one hand and the back of her neck in the other . And he said , his minty breath next to her ear , " You fuckin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did n't fuckin ' scream because something like this had happened before , with her stepfather . She had screamed and he almost had broken her fuckin ' neck . Instead of screaming , Rinker struggled violently , thrashing , spitting , kicking , swinging , twisting , trying to get loose . But Dale-Something 's hand was like a vise on her neck , and he dragged her to the camper , pulled open the door , pushed her inside , ripped her pants off and did what he was going to do in the flickering yellow illumination of the dome light . When he was done , he threw her out the back of the truck , spit on her , said , " Fuckin ' bitch , you tell anybody about this , and I 'll fuckin ' kill ya . " That was most of what she remembered about it later : lying naked on the gravel , and getting spit on ; that , and all the wiry hair on Dale 's fat wobbling butt . Rinker did n't call the cops , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , knowing cops , they probably would have sent her home to her step-dad . So she told Zanadu 's owners about the rape . The brothers Ernie and Ron Battaglia were concerned about both Rinker and their bar license . A nudie joint did n't need sex crimes in the parking lot . " Jeez , " Ron said when Rinker told him about the rape . " That 's terrible , Clara . You hurt ? You ought a get yourself looked at , you know ? " Ernie took a roll of bills from his pocket , peeled off two hundreds , thought about it for a couple of seconds , peeled off a third and tucked the three hundred dollars into her backup tube top . " Get yourself looked at , kid . " She nodded and said , " You know , I do n't wan na go to the cops . But this asshole should pay for what he did . " " We 'll take care of it , " Ernie offered . " Let me take care of it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want to do ? " " Just get him down the basement for me . He said something about being a roofer , once . He works with his hands . I 'll get a goddamn baseball bat and bust one of his arms . " Ron looked at Ernie , who looked at Rinker and said , " That sounds about right . Next time he comes in , huh ? " They did n't do it the next time he came in , which was a week later , looking nervous and shifty-eyed , like he might not be welcomed . Rinker refused to work with Dale-Something at the bar , and when she cornered Ernie in the kitchen , he told her that , goddamnit , they were right in the middle of tax season and neither he nor Ron had the emotional energy for a major confrontation . Rinker kept working on them , and the second time Dale-Something showed up , which was two days after tax day , the brothers were feeling nasty . They fed him drinks and complimentary peanuts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustled the second-to-the-last guy out , and left himself , not looking back ; he knew something was up . Then Ron came around the bar , and Ernie got Dale-Something looking the other way , and Ron nailed him with a wild , out-of-the-blue roundhouse right that knocked Dale off the barstool . Ron landed on him , rolled him , and Ernie raced around the bar and threw on a pro-wrestling death lock . Together , they dragged a barely resisting Dale-Something down the basement stairs . The brothers had him on his feet and fully conscious by the time Rinker came down , carrying her aluminum baseball bat ; or rather , T-ball bat , which had a better swing-weight for a small woman . " I 'm gon na sue you fuckers for every fuckin ' dime you got , " Dale-Something said , sputtering blood through his split lip . " My fuckin ' lawyer is doin ' the money-dance right now , you fucks ... " " Fuck you , you ai n't doing shit , " Ron said . " You raped this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ernie asked . He was standing behind Dale with his arms under Dale 's armpits , his hands locked behind Dale 's neck . " You wan na arm or a leg ? " Rinker was standing directly in front of Dale-Something , who glowered at her : " I 'm gon na ... " he started . Rinker interrupted : " Fuck legs , " she said . She whipped the bat up , and then straight back down on the crown of Dale-Something 's head . The impact sounded like a fat man stepping on an English walnut . Ernie , startled , lost his death grip and Dale-Something slipped to the floor like a two-hundred-pound blob of Jell-O . " Holy shit , " Ron said , and crossed himself . Ernie prodded Dale-Something with the toe of his desert boot , and Dale blew a bubble of blood . " He ai n't dead , " Ernie said . Rinker 's bat came up , and she hit Dale again , this time in the mastoid process behind the left ear . She hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the furnace , and her swing had some weight and snap behind it . " That ought to do it , " she said . Ernie nodded and said , " Yup . " Then they all looked at each other in the light of the single bare bulb , and Ron said to Rinker , " Some heavy shit , Clara . How do you feel about this ? " Clara looked at Dale-Something 's body , the little ring of black blood around his fat lips , and said , " He was a piece of garbage . " " You do n't feel nothin ' ? " Ernie asked . " Nothin ' . " Her lips were set in a thin , grim line . After a minute , Ron looked up the narrow wooden stairs and said , " Gon na be a load n ' a half getting his ass outa the basement . " " You got that right , " Ernie said , adding , philosophically , " I coulda told him there ai n't no free pussy . " Dale-Something went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river in Granite City , from which spot it disappeared in two days . Nobody ever asked about Dale , and Rinker went back to dancing . A few weeks later , Ernie asked her to sit with an older guy who came in for a beer . Rinker cocked her head and Ernie said , " No , it 's okay . You do n't have to do nothin ' . " So she got a longneck Bud and went to sit with the guy , who said he was Ernie 's aunt 's husband 's brother . He knew about Dale-Something . " You feeling bad about it yet ? " " Nope . I 'm a little pissed that Ernie told you about it , though , " Rinker said , taking a hit on the Budweiser . The older man smiled . He had very strong , white teeth to go with his black eyes and almost-feminine long lashes . Rinker had the sudden feeling that he might show a girl a pretty good time , although he must be over forty . " You ever shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rinker became a hit lady . She was n't spectacular , like the Jackal or one of those movie killers . She just took care of business , quietly and efficiently , using a variety of silenced pistols , mostly .22s . Careful , close-range killings became a trademark . Rinker had never thought of herself as stupid , just as someone who had n't yet had her chance . When the money from the killings started coming in , she knew that she did n't know how to handle it . So she went to the Intercontinental College of Business in the mornings , and took courses in bookkeeping and small business . When she was twenty , getting a little old for dancing nude , she got a job with the Mafia guy , working in a liquor warehouse . And when she was twenty-four , and knew a bit about the business , she bought a bar of her own in downtown Wichita , Kansas , and renamed it the Rink . The bar did well . Still , a few times a year , Rinker 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bundle of money . Some she spent , but most she hid , under a variety of names , in a variety of places . One thing her step-dad had taught her well : sooner or later , however comfortable you might be at the moment , you were gon na have to run . ( Continues ... )
