It happened exactly one hundred days after I married Andy , almost to the minute of our half-past-three-o'clock ceremony . I know this fact not so much because I was an overeager newlywed keen on observing trivial relationship landmarks , but because I have a mild case of OCD that compels me to keep track of things . Typically , I count insignificant things , like the steps from my apartment to the nearest subway ( 341 in comfortable shoes , a dozen more in heels ) ; the comically high occurrence of the phrase " amazing connection " in any given episode of The Bachelor ( always in the double digits ) ; the guys I 've kissed in my thirty-three years ( nine ) . Or , as it was on that rainy , cold afternoon in January , the number of days I had been married before I saw him smack-dab in the middle of the crosswalk of Eleventh and Broadway . <p> From the outside , say if you were a cabdriver watching frantic jaywalkers scramble to cross the street in the final seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , urban snapshot : two seeming strangers , with little in common but their flimsy black umbrellas , passing in an intersection , making fleeting eye contact , and exchanging stiff but not unfriendly hellos before moving on their way . <p> But inside was a very different story . Inside , I was reeling , churning , breathless as I made it onto the safety of the curb and into a virtually empty diner near Union Square . Like seeing a ghost , I thought , one of those expressions I 've heard a thousand times but never fully registered until that moment . I closed my umbrella and unzipped my coat , my heart still pounding . As I watched a waitress wipe down a table with hard , expert strokes , I wondered why I was so startled by the encounter when there was something that seemed utterly inevitable about the moment . Not in any grand , destined sense ; just in the quiet , stubborn way that unfinished business has of imposing its will on the unwilling . <p> After what seemed like a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Be Seated sign and said , " Oh . I did n't see you there . Should 've taken that sign down after the lunch crowd . Go ahead and sit anywhere . " <p> Her expression struck me as so oddly empathetic that I wondered if she were a moonlighting clairvoyant , and actually considered con-.ding in her . Instead , I slid into a red vinyl booth in the back corner of the restaurant and vowed never to speak of it . To share my feelings with a friend would constitute an act of disloyalty to my husband . To tell my older and very cynical sister , Suzanne , might unleash a storm of caustic remarks about marriage and monogamy . To write of it in my journal would elevate its importance , something I was determined not to do . And to tell Andy would be some combination of stupid , self-destructive , and hurtful . I was bothered by the lie of omission , a black mark on our . edging marriage , but decided it was for the best . <p> " What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag read Annie , asked me . She had curly red hair and a smattering of freckles , and I thought , The sun will come out tomorrow . <p> I only wanted a coffee , but as a former waitress , remembered how deflating it was when people only ordered a beverage , even in a lull between meals , so I asked for a coffee and a poppy seed bagel with cream cheese . <p> " Sure thing , " she said , giving me a pleasant nod . <p> I smiled and thanked her . Then , as she turned toward the kitchen , I exhaled and closed my eyes , focusing on one thing : how much I loved Andy . I loved everything about him , including the things that would have exasperated most girls . I found it endearing the way he had trouble remembering people 's names ( he routinely called my former boss Fred , instead of Frank ) or the lyrics to even the most iconic songs ( " Billie Jean is not my mother " ) . And I only shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bryant Park a dollar a day for nearly a year  --  a bum who was likely a Range Rovermahadriving con artist . I loved Andy 's confidence and compassion . I loved his sunny personality that matched his boy-next-door , blond , blue-eyed good looks . I felt lucky to be with a man who , after six long years with me , still did the half-stand upon my return from the ladies ' room and drew sloppy , asymmetrical hearts in the condensation of our bathroom mirror . Andy loved me , and I 'm not ashamed to say that this topped my reasons of why we were together , of why I loved him back . <p> " Did you want your bagel toasted ? " Annie shouted from behind the counter . <p> " Sure , " I said , although I had no real preference . <p> I let my mind drift to the night of Andy 's proposal in Vail , how he had pretended to drop his wallet so that he could , in what clearly had been a much-rehearsed maneuver , retrieve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my ring sparkling in the firelight , as I thought , This is it . This is the moment every girl dreams of . This is the moment I have been dreaming of and planning for and counting on . <p> Annie brought my coffee , and I wrapped my hands around the hot , heavy mug . I raised it to my lips , took a long sip , and thought of our year-long engagement  --  a year of parties and showers and whirlwind wedding plans . Talk of tulle and tuxedos , of waltzes and white chocolate cake . All leading up to that magical night . I thought of our misty-eyed vows . Our first dance to " What a Wonderful World . " The warm , witty toasts to us  --  speeches filled with clichTs that were actually true in our case : perfect for each other . . . true love . . . meant to be . <p> I remembered our flight to Hawaii the following morning , how Andy and I had held hands in our first-class seats , laughing at all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What part of " blend into the background " did n't the videographer get ? Could it have rained any harder on the way to the reception ? Had we ever seen his brother , James , so wasted ? I thought of our sunset honeymoon strolls , the candlelit dinners , and one particularly vivid morning that Andy and I had spent lounging on a secluded , half-moon beach called Lumahai on the north shore of Kauai . With soft white sand and dramatic lava rocks protruding from turquoise water , it was the most breathtaking piece of earth I had ever seen . At one point , as I was admiring the view , Andy rested his Stephen Ambrose book on our oversized beach towel , took both of my hands in his , and kissed me . I kissed him back , memorizing the moment . The sound of the waves crashing , the feel of the cool sea breeze on my face , the scent of lemons mixed with our coconut suntan lotion . When we separated , I told Andy that I had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best part came after the wedding , after the honeymoon , after our practical gifts were unpacked in our tiny apartment in Murray Hill  --  and the impractical , fancy ones were relegated to our downtown storage unit . It came as we settled into our husband-and wife routine . Casual , easy , and real . It came every morning , as we sipped our coffee and talked as we got ready for work . It came when his name popped into my inbox every few hours . It came at night as we shuffled through our delivery menus , contemplating what to have for dinner and proclaiming that one day soon we 'd actually use our stove . It came with every foot massage , every kiss , every time we undressed together in the dark . I trained my mind on these details . All the details that comprised our first one hundred days together . <p> Yet by the time Annie brought my coffee , I was back in that intersection , my heart thudding again . I suddenly knew that in spite of how happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't soon forget that moment , that tightness in my throat as I saw his face again . Even though I desperately wanted to forget it . Especially because I wanted to . <p> I sheepishly glanced at my reflection in the mirrored wall beside my booth . I had no business worrying about my appearance , and even less business feeling triumphant upon the discovery that I was , against all odds on an afternoon of running errands in the rain , having an extraordinarily good hair day . I also had a rosy glow , but I told myself that it was only the cold that had flushed my cheeks . Nothing else . <p> And that 's when my cell phone rang and I heard his voice . A voice I had n't heard in eight years and sixteen days . <p> " Was that really you ? " he asked me . His voice was even deeper than I remembered , but otherwise it was like stepping back in time . Like finishing a conversation only hours old . <p> " Yes , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You still have the same cell number . " <p> Then , after a considerable silence , one I stubbornly refused to fill , he added , " I guess some things do n't change . " <p> " Yes , " I said again . <p> Because as much as I did n't want to admit it , he was sure right about that . <p> Excerpted from love the one you 're with by Emily Giffin <br> Copyright 2008 by Emily Giffin <br> Published in May 2008 by St. Martin
