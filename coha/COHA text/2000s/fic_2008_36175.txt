We lived on the shore of Mirror Lake , and for many years our lives were as calm and transparent as its waters . Our old house followed the curve of the bank , in segments , like a train , each room and screened porch added on , one by one , decade by decade . <p> When I think of that time , I picture the four of us wading in the shallows , admiring our reflections in the glassy , motionless lake . Then something-a pebble , a raindrop-breaks the surface and shatters the mirror . A ripple reaches the distant bank . Our years of bad luck begin . <p> That was how Margaret would have thought . My sister was the poet . <p> I was Miss One-Thing-After-the-Next . Which is how I remember what happened . <p> But that 's not how it happened at all . One thing happened , then everything else , like a domino falling and setting off a collapse that snakes out toward the horizon and spills over into the future . <p> If all the clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . They would still feel that suck of dead air , that hollow vacuum created when time slips behind a curtain , when the minutes quit their orderly tick and ooze away , one by one . Colors are muted , a jellylike haze hovers and blurs the landscape . The phone does n't ring , and the rest of the world hides and conspires to pretend that everyone 's baking cookies or watching the game on TV . Then Monday arrives , and the comforting racket starts up all over again . <p> Even before that Sunday , I was glad to see the day end . It was n't that I liked school so much , but the weekends lasted forever . The loneliness , the hours to fill with books , homework , computer , watching old films with my sister , if she was in the mood . Silence , then the Sunday sounds of our house by the lake . My mother playing the piano , my dad 's prehistoric Selectric . <p> That Sunday , that first Sunday in May , was so warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful day , or a symptom of global warming ? Even the trees looked uncomfortable , naked and embarrassed , as if they were all simultaneously having that dream in which you look down and realize you 've forgotten to put on your clothes . <p> Two Cleopatras in our royal barge , my sister and I reclined and let our little rowboat drift out onto the lake . Margaret arched her shoulders , flung one arm over the side , and trailed her fingertips in the water . It was one of those actressy gestures she 'd copied from the classic black-and-white movies to which she was addicted . She liked me to watch them with her , and we were allowed to stay up , because our mother said we would learn more from Some Like It Hot than from a year of school . It was often hard to tell what our mother meant , exactly , except that we learned to flutter our lashes and say , " What 's a girl to do ? " in breathy little-girl whispers . <p> One thing Margaret and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew whole scenes by heart , like the end of Flying Deuces , when Hardy is killed in a plane crash and then reincarnated as a horse with a black mustache and a bowler hat . Laurel 's so happy to see him he throws his arms around Ollie-that is , the horse possessed by Ollie 's grumpy spirit . <p> Sometimes Margaret would do a gesture or line and ask me what film it was from . Her silvery laughter was my prize for getting it right . The only rowboat scene I knew was the one in which Montgomery Clift pushes Shelley Winters into the water . And I was pretty certain that was n't what Margaret was doing . <p> Margaret said , " This is heaven . " <p> I wished I could have been like her instead of the kind of person who said , " Do n't you ever worry about the polar ice caps melting ? " <p> " Debbie Downer , " said Margaret . " Give yourself a break . It 's Sunday , Nico . Take a day off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they encircled the sun like foggy auras . <p> Margaret had promised our parents she would n't smoke . Mom 's parents and Dad 's father had all died young of smoking-related causes . Both of our parents used to smoke . Their friends had started dying . The new weapon in the arsenal of Mom and Dad 's War on Smoking was some bad news we 'd gotten that fall : Margaret had a heart condition . A mild one , but I worried . <p> She 'd fainted the first and last time Mom talked us into doing yoga with her . I still have a photo my father took that day on the lawn , of the three of us doing downward-facing dog or some other mortifying position that , our mother had convinced herself , was helping her arthritis . Margaret , Mom , and I are bent till our heads nearly touch the ground , like those snakes that , Margaret told me , bite their tails and roll after the children they swallow whole . Planted apart for balance , our legs take up most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the picture does n't show is that , seconds after it was taken , Margaret collapsed in a pile of leaves . At first we 'd thought she was joking . <p> Our pediatrician , Dr. Viscott , ran some tests and said that Margaret should eat well , exercise , do n't smoke . That stutter on her heart graph was something they 'd keep their eye on . <p> Margaret knew she could smoke around me . Smoking was the least of the things she trusted me to keep secret . <p> From across the lake , we heard our mother practicing the spooky Chopin waltz that always made me think of ballroom dance music for ghosts . She kept making mistakes and starting over again . She 'd wanted to be a pianist , she 'd gone to music school , but she changed her plans when she met my dad and they ran off to be hippies . Margaret had found a snapshot of them picking soybeans on a commune in northern California . Long hair , overalls , bandannas , a Jesus beard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
