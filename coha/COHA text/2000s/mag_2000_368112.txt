Taking the platform in Los Angeles last week , Hillary Clinton showed she has mastered the ballet of politics . She extended her arms like Evita to take in the cheers of the crowd , sweeping back and forth across the stage , the mistress of all she surveyed , breaking stride only for the hackneyed wave and point  --  with astonished delight , as if she 'd just spotted a bunkmate from sleep-away camp . But once the supportive circle of six women Senators left the podium and the applause subsided , Hillary simply could n't make music . To her the Staples Center was the world 's largest day-care center , and she the patient teacher , mouthing bromides in the singsongy style that Al Gore rose above for his own address . Along about the third reference to helping children , the audience began to drift . By the time she was saying thank you ( for what she did n't say ) , many had lost the will to live . If the film introducing the President had n't been mesmerizing , the walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill she cast might not have lifted . <P> Democrats I talked to in the hall just do n't know who Hillary is on her own . Yes , she 's smart and would have made something of herself had she not married Bill Clinton . But without his sins , we would n't know she 's human . Had she not become the Wronged Wife , does anyone think Hillary 's Senate candidacy would be the least bit plausible in a state she 'd only visited as a tourist before deciding to run there ? She hated the sympathy but without it she would never have recovered enough from grabbing health-care reform for herself and then bungling it . <P> The first First Lady to abdicate White House duties , establish a separate residence ( even a separate skybox ) , Hillary , without the President , is all work but no warmth . Ca n't we just award her the Senate seat ? She has followed the owner 's manual on how to be a candidate . She kisses babies , wears funny hats , eats blintzes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and has been to so many senior citizens ' homes it 's a wonder her hair is n't blue . She 's not exaggerating when she boasts of visiting all 62 counties . She probably knows the precinct captains in Poughkeepsie . She got a pass when a long-ago aide charged that she had uttered an anti-Semitic slur against him . It helped that he was Baptist . <P> But she still ca n't catch a break with suburban women . It is n't only her hunger for the job ; she just does n't come across as genuine . It is hard for people to tell what 's true when you ca n't talk about the things most important to you and have to put a smiley face on one of the toughest political marriages in history . When she says she felt like a newlywed unpacking boxes in Chappaqua , it rings hollow . Does she really relish the prospect of rattling around in the huge empty house on her own ? When she says , " It takes a village , " does n't she really mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you people had listened " ? When she shook so many hands in the Puerto Rican Day parade that veins were bulging in her wrist , all the while earnestly asking " How are you ? , " it sounded tinny , like a hotel operator inquiring " How can I direct your call ? " Gail Sheehy reported that after that somber walk across the White House lawn , the one after the President was forced to admit he 'd had sex with " that woman , " the Clintons actually laughed and joked on the plane all the way to Martha 's Vineyard .
