Sandra and Ryan 's fake romance brings real laughs THE PROPOSAL Sandra Bullock , Ryan Reynolds , Betty White PG-13 3 stars ROMANTIC COMEDY The imperious top editor at a Manhattan book publisher , Bullock begins this enjoyable comedy as a junior clone of Meryl Streep 's wicked witch in The Devil Wears Prada .

But this ice queen soon warms up to Reynolds , and vice versa , during a visit to his family in Alaska . While breaking no new ground , Proposal is amusingly diverting and sometimes better than that .

Upon meeting Bullock , she asks tartly , " Shall I call you Margaret or the Devil 's Mistress ? " Whatever Works Larry David , Evan Rachel Wood PG-13 2 stars COMEDY In the hit-or-miss world of latter-day Woody Allen movies , his newest , Whatever Works , falls somewhere in the middle . This lightweight comedy , about a cantankerous coot ( David ) and the barely legal nymphet ( Wood ) who falls for him , starts off shaky but improves as it goes along . The 73-year-old filmmaker , who does n't appear in this one , is again exploring a familiar theme : the inexplicability of love . More specifically , that who we fall in and out of love with is beyond our control , no matter how smart and sophisticated we think ourselves . ( Or , as Allen so memorably put it in 1992 , when explaining his affair with his then-girlfriend Mia Farrow 's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn , " The heart wants what it wants . " ) Curb Your Enthusiasm 's David does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tribute than a performance . Wood lays on the southern cornpone a little thick , but she still charms . And comic ace Patricia Clarkson , who shows up as Wood 's disapproving mom , easily steals the film . BOX BETTY WHITE Talking men with The Proposal 's golden grandma SHE 'S 87 !

" ON RYAN REYNOLDS There is a sweetness about him , and I think that 's what gets through to the girls . I like when a guy can be tender .
