Charlie Kaufman has ideas , which for A screenwriter is rarer than you would think . And not just obvious ideas like killer aliens or making your children really , really small . Kaufman 's ideas for movies ( Being John Malkovich , Human Nature , Adaptation , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ) come from the part of your psyche you avoid . His scripts upend time , logic and the laws of physics , and in the process of writing them , he has upended many of the conventions of Hollywood films . But what makes Kaufman , 45 , the screenwriter to watch in Hollywood is n't his ideas or that he has created sadly sweet protagonists more convincing than Woody Allen 's ; it 's that Kaufman writes movies like they 're poems . <P> The three-act structure of most movies , Kaufman proved , may be satisfying , but it does n't unearth honesty . " I do n't know what the hell a third act is , " says Kaufman , a former sitcom writer . " It 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Clooney 's conventional direction of his script for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , the painfully shy Kaufman ( who until last month 's appearance on The Charlie Rose Show did n't show his face in the media ) is going to write a new script , pick his own actors and ask a studio to let him direct it . " I have a tendency to hire people who tend to be unattractive to the studios , " he says . " Maybe this is a bad idea . " Which , of course , will only make him like it more .  --  By Joel Stein
