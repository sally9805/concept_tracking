By Ken Ku rson I 'm going to depart this month from my tradition of wonderfully unambiguous , clearheaded , " Do this now or you 're a Fudgsicle " type of advice . It 's this simple : If you believe that the Internet and networking are real , that these are the life-changing innovations the whole damn country bet its life savings on , then you have to bet on Cisco . The company 's routers , switches , network architecture , and software dominate ; with revenues of $26 billion expected for the year , it 's not even close . The only reason Cisco can be bought for less than $16 a share today is that a , bunch of suckers paid $80 for it last year . But if you think it 's all hocus  --  pocus , that intranets and e-commerce are nice little innovations that matter to the world about as much as ham radio and minidiscs , then you have to short this stock , even if it goes down to $10 . So here 's you have to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris and Budweiser , because people will always smoke and drink , no matter what . THE UPSIDE Balance-sheet strength . In the last year or so , Cisco has bought Active Voice , Aironet Wireless , Atlantech , JetCell , Komodo Tech , and Arrows Point Communications . Some investors turn their noses up at this kind of " buying innovation " strategy . I totally disagree , especially in an industry in which small companies ca n't raise the cash they need to build the things they invent . Look at IBM 's purchase of Lotus in 1995 for $3.5 billion . At the time , everyone said it drastically overpaid . Does n't look like it today . Cisco 's acquisition binge can only be called remarkable , yet the company has virtually no , debt And it does n't loan its customers much money , either . With only $186 million of structured loans on its books , it is not beholden to shaky buyers . Unlike many of its peers who practice bookkeeping sleights of hand , Cisco does n't book the revenue on these loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility rare . Market leadership in troubled times . No lesson could be clearer from the way this market unraveled than the fact that investors love stocks when they 're dear and hate them when they 're cheap . Well , the same is true for corporate executives . When times are good , they buy the newest , most stylish things , regardless of cost or likelihood that the vendor will be around to service them five years hence . When things go bad , purchasing officers get conservative . While there are several companies making really good Internet products , Cisco is number one or number two in every category . And with the most muscular sales force , it is n't afraid to play to the fears of buyers . Revenue growth . Cisco 's gon na have $26 billion in revenues this year . In 2000 , it had $18.9 billion , and the year before , $12.2 billion . But the way it 's growing those revs is even more impressive . While America and Japan continue to contract across the board , the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , with similar success expected in India . And that 's with gross margins staying strong at 69 percent-nice proof that the company 's not simply stuffing the channel . Furthermore , Cisco 's been about the gloomiest company in dampening expectations . CEO John Chambers has been on a mission of late , telling investors that the pain will only worsen and that the economy could easily have three more quarters of sluggishness . So , the fact that Cisco 's yet to take down its official prediction of 30 to 50 percent revenue growth going forward is encouraging . Irresistible valuation ? I aggressively avoid relying on sell-side analysts , and not only because I believe the conflicts with their brokerage firms and investment banks infect the process . Most analysts have become too dependent on company guidance . These first couple of years after Regulation FD , which bars companies from releasing crucial information to select groups of analysts or investors , will really separate the men from the boys . But something that CIBC 's Steve Kamman wrote about Cisco caught my eye , especially because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector since the new year . Using a discounted cash-flow . model , he showed that Cisco 's enterprise business is worth $15 a share and its service-provider business is worth $10 . That 's about the most negative as sessment out there , and it still calls for a 50 percent hike from the stock 's current valuation . Photograph If I Designed the Money ... Do you ever get the feeling that you 're being watched-your every step , every credit-card transaction , every mouse click ? You probably are . For whatever reason , someone is trying to keep tabs on what you eat , where you go , what you know It 's different with cash . You can spend it as you please , no questions asked . Our new currency will keep that precious anonymity but will remind you that , in an age of mind-numbing data and mistrust , they 're still out there watching , whoever they are . - Steve Tolleson and Craig Clark , Tolleson Design // As with any model , this one's. only as solid as the estimates that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Against every measure  --  price to earnings , price to book value , price to cash flow , price to sales-Cisco is near the absolute bottom of its five-year range . Dig : Cisco 's current PE is 38 , compared with a five-year range of 23 to 219 . And investors getting in today pay about $5 for a buck of Cisco 's sales ; in the last five years , they paid anywhere from $4.10 to $24.70 . Is past prelude ? Is $38 for a buck of earnings cheap ? Maybe not . But if Cisco hits even the third quartile of any of these ranges , investors are sitting pretty . THE DOWNSIDE Full channel . Demand for routers and access products is shrinking for the first time from Ql to Q2 . The larger 24 percent drop in access products means less to Cisco than to others , since its $616 million from that sector is dwarfed by its $2.38 billion from routers-even after that segment 's 16 percent drop . Now , these sequential tumbles could be for a couple reasons , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Internet 's growth simply wo n't be as explosive as it was . Fueled with loads of investor capital , telecom companies bought a ton of Cisco 's products . They 've discovered they do n't need so much connectivity because demand just is n't there and wo n't be soon . Less troubling Remember the goofy theories bulls would cook up to justify the ever  --  higher prices they 'd pay ? Now some of the very same investors will cling to any harebrained explanation to predict a company 's doom . Lately , lots of bears have been running around describing how Cisco 's in trouble because bankrupt dot-coms that bought its equipment are selling the stuff for pennies on the dollar , sometimes still in the box . That ought to take a big bite out of Cisco 's sales . Yeah , right . Just like outlet stores have put Nordstrom right out of business . Balance-sheet weakness . Cisco 's enormous portfolio of holdings lost a whopping $3.5 billion , or just over $1 billion after taxes , in its Q2 ending in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 billion : The company says its holdings pretty much resemble the Nasdaq at large ; if the market continues to deteriorate , Cisco will take a double hit . Then there 's that gigantic mountain of inventory the company 's been building up-always a sign of trouble . At $2.5 billion Last quarter , the deadweight is up almost 100 percent over the last two quarters . The problem with inventory buildup is n't simply that the capital sits on the shelves ; it 's also an indication of the company 's lack of demand-assessment acumen-a potentially crippling problem that one hopes wo n't be remedied by knee-jerk fire sales every time a pile begins to form . Cagey competitors . Cisco 's combined revenues from its three main product categories-switches , access products , and routers-dwarf those of its competitors . But keeping its eye on so many balls-routers alone come in legacy , access , and remote favors-makes Cisco vulnerable in each one . Our old friend Juniper , for example , makes a high-capacity 10-gigabit router that is supposed to be excellent , and Cisco 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives big points to the first one there . Juniper 's share in the core router market has been growing , and it 's been at Cisco 's expense . WHERE I STAND If you told me last year that you 'd sell me your $80 shares of Cisco for $16 , I would have bought all I could . I still would . A bet on Cisco is a signature on a contract that says , " I believe in the long-term future of the Internet as a vital and paradigm-changing invention , " and I definitely believe that . No Internet-equipment company is better run , more central , or a fiercer competitor . At $16 , it 's not quite a steal , but it 's a bargain . // The Book Sidebar Fun with Numbers Sidebar BAD NEWS : YOUR COMPANY JUST MADE ITS ESTIMATES Sidebar In a broad-based recession , you expect just Sidebar about every sector to be affected . So I 'm skeptical Whenever a company moves too quickly to announce that it wo n't miss projections . If gross margins are thinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains that do n't reflect on the company 's fundamental health . You might need to read deep for these . Ryder somehow got up to $40 million more from its pension fund in 2000 than it did the year before-almost half the company 's earnings for the year . But simply looking at the earnings statement did n't reveal this . You had to go all the way to page 12 of Ryder 's 10-Q filing for Q3 to learn about the one-shot gain . For other ways a company can goose its numbers , take a look at selling , general , and administrative expenses . Most cuts here are not easily repeatable , and if there 's that much fat , you 've got to wonder how well the company is run . As more companies feel the pressure to hit their targets , keep an eye on the fine print . -K . K.

We 're talking about oil-royalty trusts , and although their share prices can be risky as hell , the checks they send you may just mean they 're the best stocks around in a down market , Perhaps you 've heard of REITS-real estate investment trusts , publicly traded pools that invest in property . well , oil-royalty trusts are similar , but instead of buildings , these invest in oil and natural gas . Rules allow ORTS and REITs to avoid taxes as long as they distribute at least 95 percent of their profits to shareholders . But unlike REITs , which expect to function indefinitely , ORTs last only as long as the fields to which they hold royalty rights produce meaningful amounts of fuel , in other words , there 's risk , And for that risk , there 's reward . How much reward ? LL &E; Royalty Trust was teetering near $1 a share in late ' ' 99 with no payouts . By mid-2000 , it issued a dividend of about 6 cents a month ( ORT dividends are monthly ) - an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With . gas prices rising throughout the year , the stock price skyrocketed , nearing $5 as I write this . That 's a nearly 400 percent jump on top ofa handsome dividend . Even sweeter , the gains came at a , time when the stock market crumbled . Clearly , buying at $1 when the world seemed awash in cheap power was smarter than buying today . But if you believe , as I do , that the demand for fuel , as well as the power of those who produce it , will only increase , then you definitely should know about ORTs. -K .
