For several seconds after the rocket-propelled grenade ( RPG ) drilled through the back of their armored M113 " battle taxi , " the soldiers inside , mainlining adrenaline , continued firing . Then they started screaming . " It blew my leg clean off , " says Private First Class Tristan Wyatt , who was standing at the rear of the armored personnel carrier ( APC ) , unloading an M-240 machine gun at a dozen or more Iraqis who had ambushed them minutes before . He was the first to be hit . The RPG then passed through Sergeant Erick Castro 's hip , spinning him violently to the floor . His left leg was still attached  --  but barely . " I picked up my leg and put it on the bench , " he says , " and lay down next to it . " Finally , the RPG shredded Sergeant Mike Meinen 's right leg . " It was pretty much torn off , " he says . " There was just some meat and tendons holding it on . " <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sometimes come together . The RPG that severed three legs in a fire fight late last August near Fallujah did n't explode , which probably saved the lives of Wyatt , Castro and Meinen . But even a dud traveling at nearly 1,000 ft. per sec. can slice through limbs like a meat cleaver . The three men were alive , but there was a real danger that they would bleed to death in minutes amid the smoke , dust and confusion . As troops on the two other APCs continued firing , the lone medic among the 15 soldiers on the patrol climbed up the back ramp into the compartment . " ' Holy s ! ' was the first thing out of his mouth , and it looked like his eyes were about to pop out of his head , " Wyatt remembers . " That 's kind of disheartening when he 's talking about you . " <P> The medic , the wounded soldiers and their comrades began a frantic race against the clock . Buddies pressed their hands into Castro 's hip wound to keep him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his tourniquet was useless . He handed it to Wyatt , who needed two to stanch the blood flowing from his femoral artery . Amid the mayhem , Meinen , who had been manning a 50-cal. machine gun , noticed that he did n't have any feeling in his right foot . " It felt like it had gone to sleep on me , so I picked my foot up and was trying to massage it , trying to get the feeling back , " he says . " But then it dawned on me : it was n't even connected . So I put it on the floor . " <P> They tried to raise their wounded legs to slow the bleeding . " There was nothing to elevate my leg except for the piece of my leg that had been blown off from the knee down , " Wyatt says . " So I took my leg and jammed it under the stump to keep it pointing up . It was kind of messy . " It may have been messy , but it worked . Meinen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're not gon na die in this track , " Meinen said . " We 're not gon na die over here . " He was right . About an hour after being wounded  --  thanks to their colleagues and a Black Hawk medevac flight  --  the three U.S. soldiers were receiving some of the world 's best medical care at the 28th Combat Support Hospital , south of Baghdad . Wyatt and Meinen were back in the U.S. about three days later . It was a week before the more seriously wounded Castro landed on U.S. soil .
