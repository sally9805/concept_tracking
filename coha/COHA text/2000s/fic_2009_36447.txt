Poisons , pumped down here at enormous pressure , had oozed deep into the water table . The seamy stone was warped and twisted . All around her , toxin miners scuttled like crabs . <br> The toxin miners pried the poisoned rock apart , slurped up toxins with busy hoses , then deftly reassembled the stifling walls in a jigsaw mess of glue . In their exoskeletons and filter suits , the miners looked like construction cranes wrapped in trash bags . <br> The miners were used to their work and superbly good at it . They measured their progress in meters per day . They were subterranean bricklayers . Cracking blocks and stacking blocks : that was their very being . <br> Vera thought longingly of glorious light and air at the island 's sunny surface , which , from the cramped and filthy depths of this mine , seemed as distant as the surface of Mars . Vera had made it a matter of personal principle to know every kind of labor on the island : forestry , reef restoration , the census of species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vilest redemption work she 'd ever seen . The workers were a gang of grimy , knobby ghosts , recycling sewage inside a locked stone closet . <br> Her helmeted head rang with a sudden buzz of seismic sensors , as if her graceless filter suit were filled with bees . Tautly braced within their shrouds and boneware , the miners studied the tortured rock through their helmet faceplates . They muttered helpful advice at each other . <br> Vera loaded the mine 's graphic server . She tapped into the augment that the miners were sharing . <br> Instantly , the dark wet rock of the mine burst into planes of brilliant color-coding : cherry red , amber yellow , veins of emerald green . . . A dazzling graphic front end for this hellhole . <br> Using their gauntlets , the miners drilled thumb-sized pits into the dirty rock . They plucked color-coded blasting caps from damp-stained satchels at their waists . They tamped in charges . Within a minute came the blast . Vera , sealed within her suit and padded helmet , felt her teeth clack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their boneware , the miners wrestled out a cracked slab the size of a coffin . <br> A stew of effluent gushed forth . The bowels of the Earth oozed false-color gushes of scarlet and maroon . <br> " You can help me now , " Karen beckoned . <br> Vera chased the software from her faceplate with a shake of her head . Vera 's sensorweb offered sturdy tech support to anyone who might redeem the island , but the mediation down this mine was in a terrible state . These miners were plumbing the island 's bowels with bombs and picks , but when it came to running their everyware , they never synchronized the applications , they never optimized the servers , they never once emptied the caches of the client engines . Why were people like that ? <br> Badly encumbered by her filter shroud , Vera clambered to Karen 's side through a cobweb of safety supports . The carbon-fiber safety webs looked as useless as dirty gossamer . Strain monitors glowed all over them , a spectral host of underground glowworms . <br> Vera found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " <br> " Put both your hands up . <br> Here . And over there . Right . Hold all that up . " Vera stood obediently . Her exoskeleton locked her body tight against the ceiling . <br> Karen 's boneware creaked as she hefted her power drill . She studied the rock 's warping grain through the mediation of her faceplate , whistling a little through her teeth . Then she probed at a dripping seam . " This part 's nasty , " she warned . <br> Her drill spewed a tornado of noise . Vera 's guts , lungs , and muscles shook with the racket . It got much worse as Karen dug , jammed , and twisted . Within her boneware , Vera 's flesh turned to jelly . <br> Karen handled her massive drill with a dainty attention to detail , as if its long whirring bit were a chopstick . <br> Gouts of flying rock dust pattered off Vera 's helmet . She twisted her neck and felt the helmet 's cranial sensors dig into her scalp . <br> Two miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hauling their hoses and power cables , as if they were trailing spilled guts . They never seemed to tire . <br> Stuck in her posture of cramped martyrdom to duty , Vera sourly enjoyed a long , dark spell of self-contemplation . <br> Like an utter idiot , she had allowed herself to be crammed into this black , evil place . . . No , in a bold gust of crusading passion , she had grabbed her sensor kit and charged headlong down into this mine to tackle the island 's worst depths . Why ? To win some glow of deeper professional glory , or maybe one word of praise from her boss ? <br> How could she have been that stupid , that naive ? Herbert was never coming down here into a toxin mine . Herbert was a professional . Herbert had big plans to fulfill . <br> Herbert was a career Acquis environmental engineer , with twenty years of service to his credit . Vera also wore the Acquis uniform , but , as a career Acquis officer , Vera was her own worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beak like a magpie , trying to weave her sensor-webbing over the whole Earth ? Any engineer who ran a sensorweb always thought she was the tech support for everything and everybody . " Ubiquitous , pervasive , and ambient "  --  all those fine words just meant that she would never be able to leave anything alone . <br> No amount of everyware and mediation could disguise the fact that this mine was a madhouse . The ugly darkness here , the grit , the banging , grinding , and blasting , the sullen heat , the seething damp : and the whole place was literally full of poison ! She was breathing through micropored plastic , one filmy layer away from tainted suffocation . <br> Stuck in her rigid posture of support , Vera gazed angrily through the rounded corners of her helmet faceplate . Nobody else down in this mine seemed at all bothered by the deadly hazards surrounding them . <br> Was she living an entirely private nightmare , was she insane ? Maybe she had been crazy since childhood . Anyone who learned about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives were higher and broader and finer , maybe she simply understood life better than these dirty morons . Stinging sweat dripped over Vera 's eyebrows . Yes , this ugly mayhem was the stuff of life for the tunnel rats . They had followed their bliss down here . This hell was their homeland . Fresh air , fresh water , golden sunlight , these were alien concepts for them . These cavemen were going to settle down here permanently , burrowing into the poisonous wet and stink like bony salamanders . They would have children , born without eyes . . . <br> " Stay alert , " Karen warned her . Vera tried , without success , to shrug in her locked exoskeleton . " Work faster , then . " <br> " Do n't you hustle me , " said Karen merrily . " I 'm an artist . " " Let 's get this over with . " <br> " This is not the kind of work you can hurry , " said Karen . " Besides , I love my drill , but they built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me do the drilling . You can hold this roof up . " <br> " Vera , I know what I 'm doing . " With a toss of her head , Karen lit up her bodyware . A halo of glory appeared around her , a mediated golden glow . <br> This won her the debate . Karen was the expert , for she was very glorious down here . Karen was glorious because she worked so hard and knew so much , and she was so beloved for that . The other miners in this pit , those five grumbling and inarticulate cavemen banging their rocks and trailing their long hoses  --  they adored Karen 's company . Karen 's presence down here gave their mine a warm emotional sunlight . Karen was their glorious , golden little star . <br> There was something deeply loathsome about Karen 's cheery affection for her labor and her coworkers . Sagging within her locked boneware , Vera blinked and gaze-tracked her way through a nest of menu options . <br> Look at that : Karen had abused the mine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual wisecracks and graffiti , plus a tacky host of cute icons and stencils . Could anything be more hateful ? <br> A shuddering moan came from the rock overhead . Black ooze cascaded out and splashed the shrouds around their legs . <br> Karen cut the drill . Vera 's stricken ribs and spine finally stopped shaking . <br> " That happens down here sometimes , " Karen told her , her voice giddy in the limpid trickling of poisoned water . " Do n't be scared . <br> " Vera was petrified . " Scared of what ? What happens down here ? " <br> " Just keep your hands braced on that big vein of dolomite , " Karen told her , the lucid voice of good sense and reason . <br> " We 've got plenty of safety sensors . This whole mine is crawling with smart dust . " <br> " Are you telling me that this stupid rock is moving ? " <br> " Yeah . It moves a little . Because we 're draining it . It has to subside . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " You 're holding it up , " Karen pointed out . She wiped her helmet 's exterior faceplate with a dainty little sponge on a stick . " I just hit a good nasty wet spot ! I can practically smell that ! " <br> " But what if this whole mine falls in on us ? That would smash us like bugs ! " <br> Karen sneezed . All cross-eyed , she looked sadly at the spray across the bottom of her faceplate . " Well , that wo n't happen . " <br> " How do you know that ? " <br> " It wo n't happen . It 's a judgment call . " This was not an answer Vera wanted to hear . The whole point of installing and running a sensorweb was to avoid human " judgment calls . " Only idiots used guesswork when a sensorweb was available . <br> For instance , pumping toxins down here in the first place : that was some idiot 's " judgment call . " <br> Some fool had judged that it was much easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be clean . Then the Acquis had arrived with their sensorweb and their mediation , so everybody knew everything about the woe and horror on this island . The hidden criminality was part of the public record , suddenly . They were mining the crime . There was crime all around them . <br> A nasty fit of nerves gathered steam within Vera . She had n't had one of these fits of nerves in months . She had thought she was well and truly over her fits of nerves . She 'd been sure she would never have a fit of nerves while wearing an Acquis neural helmet . <br> " Let me use the drill , " Vera pleaded . " This drill needs a special touch . " <br> " Let me do it . " <br> " You volunteered for mine work , " said Karen . " That does n't make you good at it . Not yet . " <br> ' We learn by doing , ' " Vera quoted stiffly , and that was a very correct , Acquis-style thing to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen braced herself against the stony roof . <br> Vera wrapped her arms around the rugged contours of the drill . Her boneware shifted at the hips and knees as she raised the drill 's tip overhead . She pressed the trigger . <br> The drill whirled wildly in her arms and jammed . All the lights in the mine went out . <br> Vera 's exoskeleton , instantly , locked tight around her flesh . She was stuck to the drill as if nailed to it . <br> " I 'm stuck , " she announced . " And it 's dark . " <br> " Yeah , we 're all stuck here now , " said Karen , in the sullen blackness . Toxic water dripped musically . <br> " I ca n't move ! I ca n't see my own hands . I ca n't even see my mediation ! " <br> " That 's because you just blew out the power , Vera . Freezing the system is a safety procedure . <br> " An angry , muffled shout came from another miner . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miner sloshing toward them through the darkness . <br> " I did that ! " Vera shouted . In the Acquis , it was always best to take responsibility at once . " That was my fault ! I 'll do better . " <br> " Oh . So it was you ? You , the newbie ? " <br> Karen was indignant . " Gregor , do n't you dare call Vera a ' newbie . ' This is Vera Mihajlovic ! Compared to her , you 're the newbie . " <br> " Well , it 's a good thing I still have charge left in my capacitors . " <br> Karen sighed aloud in the wet darkness . " Just go and reboot us , Gregor . We 've all got a schedule to meet . " <br> " Please help me , " Vera begged him . " I 'm stuck here , I ca n't move ! " <br> " You 'll have to wait for a miracle , stupid , " said Gregor , and he left them there , rigid in the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gregor 's our very best rock man , but he 's not exactly a people person . " <br> Vera heaved uselessly against the silent pads and straps of her dead exoskeleton . Her boneware , which gave her such strength , grace , lightness , power , had become her intimate prison . <br> " Who designed all this ? " she shrieked . " We should have power backups ! We should have fuel cells ! " <br> " Be glad that we can still hear each other talking . " Karen 's voice sounded flat and muffled though her helmet and shroud . " It 's too hot down here to run any fuel cells . Gregor will reboot us . He can do it , he 's good . You just wait and see . <br> " A long , evil moment passed . Panic rose and clutched the dry lining of Vera 's throat . " This is horrible ! " <br> " Yes , " said Karen mournfully , " I guess it is , pretty much . " <br> " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to stand it , Vera . We ca n't do anything but stand here . <br> " Claustrophobic terror washed through Vera 's beating heart . <br> " I ca n't do it , " she said . " I ca n't bear any more . " <br> " I 'm not scared , " Karen told her . " I used to be very scared every time I came down here . But emotion is a neural state . A neural state ca n't touch you . I 'm never afraid like I used to be . Sometimes I have fear-thoughts , but my fear-thoughts are not me . " <br> " I 'll scream ! " <br> Karen 's voice was full of limpid sympathy . " You can scream , then . Do it . I 'm here for you . " <br> Seen from the airy hilltop , Mljet was a tattered flag , all bays , peninsulas , and scattered islets . The island 's scalloped shores held stains in their nooks and corners : the algae blooms . <br> The rising Adriatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island 's trees . <br> The island 's blanket of pines and oaks was torn by clear-cut logging , scarred black with forest fires . <br> And if the golden shore of this beautiful place had suffered , the island 's interior was worse . Mljet 's angry creeks had collapsed the island 's bridges as if they 'd been kneecapped with pistols . Up in the rocky hills , small , abandoned villages silently flaked their paint . <br> Year by year , leaning walls and rust-red roofs were torn apart by towering houseplants gone feral . The island 's rotting vineyards were alive with buzzing flies and beetles , clouded with crows . <br> A host of flowers had always adorned this sunny place . There were far more flowers in these years of the climate crisis . Harsh , neck-high thickets of rotting flowers , feeding scary , billowing clouds of angry bees . <br> Such was her home . From the peak of the island , where she stood , throat raw , flesh trembling , mind in a whirl , she could see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , taste it in the wind . She was changing it . <br> Continues ...
