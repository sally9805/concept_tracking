Adele <br> To call Portia Kane a waste of space was being charitable . She was negative space  --  a vacuum that sucked in everything around her . An entire industry had grown up to service this spoiled " celebutante . " Lives were wasted catering to her whims , feeding her ego , splashing her vapid face across the news . <br> And for what ? She was n't smart , was n't talented , was n't pretty , was n't even interesting . Adele should know . She 'd spent the last two years wallowing in the oatmeal mush that was Portia 's mind . But soon she 'd be free . If she dared . <br> Adele stabbed a ripe baby tomato . The innards squirted down the front of her shirt . The insanely expensive white shirt she 'd bought just for this meeting . She grabbed a linen napkin , but only ground the pulp into a bloody smear . <br> A tinkling laugh rose above the murmur of the lunch crowd . Adele turned to see Portia leaning over the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . To them , she was invisible . That was the goal  --  never let your prey know it 's being stalked . <br> Paparazzi . An ugly word , with an uglier reputation . The kumpania never used it . They were n't like those curs , endlessly chasing their prey , trying to corner it , provoke it , snatching mouthfuls of flesh where they could . Kumpania photographers were clever foxes , staying out of the fray and getting the most profitable shots through cunning , craft and clairvoyance . <br> A man cut through the gathering near the restaurant entrance . Was that him ? They 'd only spoken by phone , but she was sure it was . He had their look  --  the thinning blond hair , the unnaturally blue eyes , the arrogant tilt of the chin , the razor-sharp cut of the suit . <br> And he was looking right at her . Smiling at her . Coming toward her . In that moment , Adele knew how a fox felt when it saw its first grizzly . <br> All sensible supernaturals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of severance packages usually involved the removal of body parts . For clairvoyants , though , that fear rose to outright terror . By the time clairvoyants finished working for a Cabal , they 'd lost the most vital body part of all  --  their minds . <br> The power of clairvoyance came with the price tag of insanity , a fate the kumpania promised to save them from in return for a lifetime of servitude . They also promised to protect their clairvoyants from the Cabals , which would woo them with promises of wealth , then drain their powers and retire them to a padded cell , drooling and raving , brought out only for horrific experiments . <br> And now Adele was willingly meeting with a Cabal sorcerer . Willingly offering herself to his corporation . Was she mad ? She had to run , escape while she still could . <br> She gripped her thighs , squeezing until the pain crystallized her fear into resolve . The grizzly might be the biggest predator in the forest , but a clever fox could use that . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get out while she was still sane enough to enjoy it . <br> Adele touched her stomach . In it , she carried the ultimate bargaining chip . With it , she did n't need to flee the grizzly . She could run to it , hide behind it , use it to escape the kumpania and get the kind of life she deserved . <br> The man stopped beside her table . " Adele Morrissey ? " He extended his hand . " Irving Nast . A pleasure to meet you . We have a lot to talk about . " <br> <br> Robyn <br> <br> The world was a shitty place ; no one knew that better than Robyn Peltier . Every day for the past six months , she 'd scoured the news for a story that proved it . She sometimes had to check two newspapers , but never more than that . <br> No common murder or assault would do . What Robyn looked for were the stories that made people call over their shoulders , " Hey , hon , can you believe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe because they supported a sneaking suspicion that this world was an ugly , fucked-up place where no one gave a damn about anyone else . <br> The experts blamed everything from video game violence to hormones in the milk to the wrath of God . People wrung their hands and moaned about what the world was coming to , as if callous disregard for human life was some new phenomenon . Bullshit . It started back when the first caveman clubbed a buddy for his wicked new spear . <br> But it 's easier to tell yourself the world is a good , civilized place , filled with good , civilized people , because that 's what you need to believe to keep going . And it works just fine until the day the ugliness seeps to the surface and sucks your life into the cesspool . <br> Today , Robyn found her story on page two of the L.A. Times . A man had shot a kid for walking across his lawn and thought he was perfectly justified  --  because , after all , it was his lawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page of her bulging scrapbook , then smoothed the plastic over it . Number 170 . <br> Before she put the scrapbook back on the shelf , she flipped back to page one and read the headline , as she had 170 times before : " Good Samaritan Gunned Down on Highway . " She touched the face in the photo , tracing his cheek , where the plastic covering was almost worn through , and she thought , for the 170th time , what a crappy picture it was . <br> There was no excuse for picking a bad photo . As a public relations consultant , Robyn knew better than anyone the importance of providing the right picture to convey your message . She thought of all the ones she could have given the press . Damon playing hoops with his nephews . Damon treating his tenth-grade class to post-exam pizza . Damon goofing around with his garage band . Damon grinning at their wedding . <br> Damn it , any picture of him smiling would have done . How hard was that ? The man was a born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up . After five years together , she had hundreds of photos of him , any one of which would have shown the world what it had lost that night . <br> But when asked for a photo , she 'd been dealing with the press , the police , the funeral arrangements , everyone clamoring for her attention when all she 'd wanted to do was slam the door , fall to the floor and sob until exhaustion blessed her with sleep . She 'd grabbed the first picture she could find  --  his somber college graduation shot  --  and shoved it into their hands . <br> Robyn 's cell phone rang . " Diamonds Are a Girl 's Best Friend . " Portia had set up the ring tone . Not that Portia needed her own special one . These days , if Robyn 's phone rang , it was almost always Portia , who kept her busier than her dozen clients back in Philadelphia . In this business , the only job crazier than doing PR for Paris Hilton was doing PR for the girl who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrapbook back on the shelf , then answered . <br> " Finally , " Portia breathed . " It rang , like , ten times , Rob . " <br> Three , but Robyn knew better than to correct her . " Sorry , I was in the other room . " <br> Silence , as Portia contemplated the concept of being , even momentarily , cell phone free . <br> " So how was lunch with Jasmine ? " Robyn asked . <br> She braced for the answer and prayed if cleanup was required , it would n't involve posting bail this time . The tabloids called Jasmine Wills a " frenemy " of Portia 's , but if there was any " friend " in the equation , Robyn had yet to see it . <br> The two young women had n't spoken since Jasmine stole Brock DeBeers , the former boy-band heartthrob who really had made Portia 's heart throb . Robyn had warned Portia not to accept the invitation to a makeup lunch , but Portia had only laughed , saying Robyn did n't understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked Brock that much . She only kept his photo in her room because she had n't found time to redecorate . <br> Apparently , Jasmine had spent the entire meal regaling Portia with tales of her wild sex life with Brock . Man 's inhumanity to man . Sometimes it was shooting a helpful stranger , sometimes it was beating your BFF 's dignity into the ground with a crowbar . <br> " But I 'm going to get her back . I have a plan . " <br> Portia 's singsong cracked at the edges , and Robyn bled a little for her . She wished she could write Portia off as a vacuous twit who was sucking her dry with her neediness , but she supposed it would take another 170 articles in her scrapbook to drain her last ounce of sympathy . <br> Or maybe Robyn just liked to bleed . Maybe that was why she 'd taken the job . Representing Portia Kane was the lowest , most meaningless form of PR work she could imagine . But after Damon 's death , she 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else cared . Why should she ? <br> " Oh , and then , just before the bill came , Penny called and guess what ? They ca n't make it to Bane tonight because  --  get this  --  they 're going to the opening of Silhouette with Jasmine . How much you want to bet Jasmine told Penny to call at lunch so she could watch my reaction ? " <br> Every dollar I have , thought Robyn . Portia was n't stupid . That was the problem . It 'd be so much easier if Robyn could write her off as a vacuous twit . But then she 'd show some spark of intelligence , some proof that she could do more with her life than grace club openings . <br> " So what about that benefit concert tonight ? " Robyn asked . " If you 're skipping Bane , I can call and get you back on the list  --  " <br> " Benefit concert ? Oh God , Rob , kill me now . No , I 'm still going to Bane , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to be to invite your PR rep clubbing ? " I 'd love to , but I have plans . Remember that friend I was with yesterday , when you came by ? " <br> " The Indian girl ? " <br> " Hope is Indo-American . " <br> Portia 's put-upon sigh made Robyn press her fingertips into her temples . Portia never ceased to complain about Robyn correcting her gaffes , ignoring the fact Portia had asked for that " sensitivity training " herself , after she 'd been quoted making a racist comment about the city 's Hispanic population . Hiring Robyn had been her idea of damage control . She 'd needed a new PR rep and someone mentioned Robyn , saying she was looking to relocate after her husband 's death . A real tragedy . He was trying to help a stranded motorist , but the woman saw a black guy coming at her on an empty highway and shot him . <br> With that , Portia had seen the perfect way to prove she was n't racist . Then Robyn showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on Portia 's face , you 'd think she 'd never heard the term " interracial marriage . " <br> Portia was still nattering on about Hope . " So bring her and make sure she looks hot  --  but not hotter than me . " <br> " We already had plans , Portia . " <br> " It 's Bane . Now , I know she works for True News , but under absolutely no circumstances is she allowed to report on our evening . Got it ? " <br> In other words , Portia expected full coverage on the front page . <br> " Hope is n't a celebrity reporter . She 's their weird tales girl , so unless you 're going to sprout a tail or breathe fire , she 's no  --  " <br> " Okay , tell her she can report on it . An exclusive . Oh , and make sure she brings that hot boyfriend , and tell him to bring some friends . Hot friends . " <br> " He does n't have friends here , Portia . They are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeal . " Finally . Jasmine 's coming out of the restaurant . Tim , start the car . Move forward , slowly . Rob , hold on . " <br> " What  --  ? " <br> The line went dead . Robyn was putting the phone down when it rang again . <br> It was Portia . " Remember how you gave me shit for wearing that micro skirt last week ? Wait until you see this . " A split-second pause . " Well ? What do you think ? " <br> " Of what ? " <br> " The photo I just sent you . " <br> Robyn checked her mail . There , with the caption " Wait til tabs see this ! ! ! " was a picture of Jasmine Wills wearing what looked like a baby-doll nightgown . A see-through nightgown . Gauzy pink , with a red bra-and-panty set underneath . <br> " Well ? " <br> " I 'm speechless . " <br> " You 're going to send it , right ? To the tabs ? Oh ! Send it to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cover  --  " <br> " Then tell her to make an exception . Oh , my God ! There 's Brock ! Tim , pull forward . " <br> Click . Portia was gone . <br> <br> Hope <br> It took a half-dozen tries to get the key-card light to work  --  long enough that Hope was tempted to practice her electronic lock-picking skills . When the light finally did turn green , she was leaning against the door , handle down , and it flew open under her weight , sending her stumbling inside . She listened for Karl 's laugh and when it did n't come , felt a twinge of disappointment . <br> She should n't have been surprised . She 'd told him she 'd probably have to work late , so she did n't expect him back . Still , her disappointment smacked of dependence . Karl was n't the kind of guy she should count on . <br> Hope went to toss her purse on the bed , but threw her laptop case instead . Too much on her mind , fretting about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fighting the nagging feeling that the two were n't unrelated . The more she watched her friend spiral downhill , the more anxious she got about where she was heading with Karl . <br> She kicked off her pumps and squeezed the carpet between her toes , luxuriating in the feel of it , inhaling the scent of flowers ? <br> There , on the desk , was a bouquet of yellow and purple irises . Hope read the tag . From her mother , hoping her first week of work was going well . It was n't exactly a new job  --  she 'd been at True News for four years , and this was her second L.A. work exchange . <br> She had n't planned to return . Los Angeles was n't her kind of city , really . But the chance for a six-week stint came right as Hope had been trying to schedule vacation time to visit Robyn , and it seemed like the perfect solution . <br> They 'd been friends since high school , when Hope 's private academy had been running a joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been assigned to the same committee . Afterward they 'd stayed in touch , gradually becoming friends . Then , in Hope 's senior year , when the visions and voices started , she 'd had a breakdown and spent her prom night in a mental ward . Robyn had been the only friend who had n't slipped away , as if Hope 's problems might be contagious . <br> Now Hope had a chance to help Robyn with her problem . When she 'd come to L.A. , she 'd expected Karl would take the opportunity to do a " work exchange " of his own in Europe . Instead , he 'd joined her . As good as that felt , she could n't shake the fear she was getting too used to having him join her on business trips , and that the day he did n't want to come along , she 'd be devastated . <br> " You 're home early . You should have called . " <br> She spun as Karl stepped inside . He 'd changed since meeting her for lunch , trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit that looked like it came from a department store , well below Karl 's usual standards . Not that it mattered . Karl could make Goodwill castoffs look good . The lowbrow attire was camouflage  --  Karl 's way of blending into a crowd , and the moment he stepped into the room , though , the tie and jacket were off , cast onto the chair like a hair shirt . <br> " Good hunting ? " Hope asked . <br> " You forgot to lock the deadbolt and chain . " <br> He kissed the top of her head , cushioning the rebuke . She could feel the chaos waves of worry rolling off him . When Karl settled in a new city , he could n't relax until he 'd cleared out any other werewolves . Kill Karl Marsten , and a werewolf would instantly seal his reputation , guaranteeing for years to come that others would clear out of his way . <br> Continues ...
