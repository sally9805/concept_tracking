Chapter One Prelude Mitch Rapp stared through the one-way mirror into the dank , subterranean cement chamber . A man , clothed in nothing more than a pair of underwear , sat handcuffed to a small , ridiculously uncomfortable-looking chair . A naked lightbulb hung from the ceiling , dangling only a foot or so above him . The stark glare of the light combined with his state of near total exhaustion , caused the man 's head to droop forward , leaving his chin resting on his chest . He was dangerously close to losing his balance and toppling over , which was exactly what they wanted . Rapp checked his watch . He was running out of time and patience . He 'd just as soon shoot this piece of human refuse and get it over with , but the present situation was more complicated than that . He needed the man to talk , that was the point of this endeavor . They all talked eventually , of course , that was n't the problem . The trick was to get them to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far he was sticking to his story , a story Rapp knew to be an outright lie . The CIA counterterrorism operative hated coming to this place . It literally made his skin crawl . It had all the charm of a mental hospital without the barred windows and the beefy orderlies stuffed into their white uniforms . It was a place intentionally designed to starve the human mind of stimuli . It was so secret , it did n't even have a name . The handful of people who knew of its existence referred to it only as the Facility . It was off the books , not even listed in the black-intelligence budget submitted in secret to Congress every year . The Facility was a relic from the Cold War . It was located near Leesburg , Virginia , and looked just like all the other horse farms dotting the countryside thereabouts . Situated on sixty-two beautiful rolling acres , the place had been purchased by the Agency in the early fifties , at a time when the CIA was given far more latitude and discretion than it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA debriefed Eastern Bloc defectors , and even a few of the Agency 's own who were snared in the net of James Angleton , the CIA 's notoriously paranoid genius who was in charge of rooting out spies during the height of the Cold War . Very nasty things had been done to people in this crypt . This was where the CIA would have likely taken Aldrich Ames if they had caught him before the FBI did . The men and women who were charged with protecting Langley 's secrets would have given almost anything for the chance to put the screws to that traitorous bastard , but they were unfortunately denied the opportunity . The Facility was not a pleasant place , but it was a necessary evil in a world chock-full of sadistic deeds and misguided , brutal men . This was something Rapp was more than aware of , but that did n't mean he had to like it . He was neither delicate nor squeamish . Rapp had killed more men than he could even attempt to count , and he 'd employed his craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer depth of his skill . He was a modern-day assassin who lived in a civilized country where such a term could never be used openly . His was a nation that loved to distinguish itself from the less refined nations of the world . A democracy that celebrated individual rights and freedom . A state that would never tolerate the open recruiting , training , and use of one of its own citizens for the specific purpose of covertly killing the citizens of another country . But that was exactly who Rapp was . He was a modern-day assassin who was conveniently called an operative so as to not offend the sensibilities of the cultured people who occupied the centers of power in Washington . If those very people knew of the existence of the Facility they would fly into an indignant rage that would result in the partial or complete destruction of the CIA . These haters of America 's capitalistic muscle wanted to analyze what we had done to evoke such hatred from the terrorists , all the while missing the point that they were using the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on a short skirt , sexy top , and high heels - maybe she was asking for it ? America was a rude and arrogant country run by selfish , colonialist men who were out to exploit the resources of lesser countries - maybe we were asking for it ? Under their narrow definition the Washington elite would call this place a torture chamber . Rapp , however , knew what real torture was , and it was n't this . This was coercion , it was sensory deprivation , it was interrogation , but it was n't real torture . Real torture was causing a person so much unthinkable pain that he or she begged to be killed . It was hooking alligator clips to a man 's testicles and sending jolts of searing electricity through his body , it was gang-raping a woman day after day until she slipped into a coma , it was forcing a man to watch as his wife and children were sodomized by a bunch of thugs , it was making a man eat his own excrement . It was monstrous , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time and time again such methods proved that most prisoners would say or do almost anything to stop the pain , sign any confession , create terrorist plots that did n't exist , even turn on their own parents . Rapp was a practical man , however , and the prisoner sitting cuffed to the chair on the other side of the glass knew firsthand what real torture was . The organization he worked for was notorious for its treatment of political prisoners . If anyone was deserving of a good beating it was this vile bastard , but still there were other things to consider . Rapp did n't like torture , not only because of its effect on the person being brutalized , but for what it did to the person who sanctioned and carried it out . He had no desire to sink to those depths unless it was a last resort , but unfortunately they were quickly approaching that point . Lives were at stake . Two CIA operatives were already dead , thanks to the duplicitous scum in the other room , and many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , and if Rapp did n't find out what it was hundreds , maybe thousands , of innocent people would die . The door to the observation room opened and a man approximately the same age as Rapp entered . He walked up to the window and with his deep-set brown eyes looked at the handcuffed man . There was a certain clinical detachment in the way the man carried himself . His hair was elegantly cut and his beard trimmed to perfection . He was dressed in a dark , well-tailored suit , white dress shirt with French cuffs , and an expensive red silk tie . He owned two identical sets of the outfit , and in an effort to keep his subject off balance , it was the only thing he had worn in front of the man since his arrival three days ago . The outfit was carefully chosen to convey a sense of superiority and importance . Bobby Akram was one of the CIA 's best interrogators . He was a Pakistani immigrant and a Muslim , who was fluent in Urdu , Pashto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Akram had controlled every detail of every second of his prisoner 's incarceration . Every noise , variation in temperature , morsel of food and drop of liquid had been carefully choreographed . The goal with this specific subject , as with any subject , was to get him to talk . The first step had been to isolate him and strip him of all sense of time and place by immersing him in a world of sensory deprivation until he craved stimuli . Akram would then throw the man a lifeline ; he would begin a dialogue . He would get the man to talk , not even necessarily to divulge secrets , at least not at first . The secrets would come later . To do the job thoroughly and properly took a great deal of time and patience , but those were luxuries they did not possess . Intelligence was time sensitive and that meant things had to be expedited . Turning to Rapp he said , " It should n't be much longer . " " I sure as hell hope not , " grumbled Rapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of them . Akram smiled . He had great respect for the legendary CIA operative . The two of them were on the front line of this war against terrorism , allies with a mutual enemy . For Rapp it was about protecting innocent people against the aggressions of a growing threat . For Akram it was about saving the religion he loved from a group of fanatics who had twisted the words of the great prophet so they could perpetuate hatred and fear . Akram checked his watch and asked , " Are you ready ? " Rapp nodded and looked again at the exhausted , bound man . He mumbled a few curses to himself . If word got out about this , all of his accomplishments and connections would n't be able to save him . He was way off the reservation with this little hunt , but he needed answers and running things through the proper channels was sure to get him bogged down in a quagmire of politics and diplomacy . There were too many varying interests at play , without even getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other room was Colonel Masood Haq of the dreaded Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence or ISI . Without telling anyone at Langley , Rapp had hired a team of freelancers to snatch the man and bring him here . The brutal murders of two CIA operatives , and a growing fear that al-Qaeda had reconstituted itself , had given Rapp the impetus to take action without authorization . Akram pointed at their prisoner as he began to nod off . " He 's going to fall over any second . Are you sure you want to go forward with your plan right now ? " Akram crossed his arms . " If we wait another day or two I 'm very confident I can get him to talk . " Rapp shook his head and answered firmly . " My patience has run out . If you do n't get him to talk , I will . " Akram nodded thoughtfully . He was not opposed to using the good cop/bad cop technique of interrogation . On the right person the results could be quite satisfactory . Akram himself , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave that to others . " All right . When I get up and leave that 's your cue . " Rapp acknowledged the plan , and kept his eyes on the bound man as Akram left the room . The prisoner had no idea how long he had been here , how long he had been in the hands of his captors , or who his captors even were . He had no idea where he was , what country , let alone what continent . He had heard only one man speak , and that was Akram , a fellow Pakistani by birth . He would , of course , assume that he was being held in his own country , probably by the ISI 's chief competitor , the IB , and because of that he would hold out as long as he could in the belief that the ISI would come to his rescue . He had been drugged and deprived of all sense of time and routine . He was an exhausted man awash in a sea of sensory deprivation . He was ready to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hopes would crumble . As Akram had predicted , the man had finally dozed off long enough to lose his balance and topple over . He hit the floor fairly hard , but did n't bother attempting to get up . Having been in this hopeless position countless times during his incarceration , he knew it was impossible . Akram entered the room with two assistants . While they righted the prisoner , Akram pulled up a chair and told his assistants to remove the man 's restraints . When the prisoner was free to move his arms and legs , Akram handed him a glass of water . The two assistants went and stood in the shadows by the door in case they were needed . " Now , Masood , " Akram said in the man 's native language , " would you like to start telling me the truth ? " The man glared at his interrogator with bloodshot eyes , " I have been telling you the truth . I am not a supporter of the Taliban or al-Qaeda . I deal with them only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know that General Musharraf has made it very clear that we are to stop supporting the Taliban and al-Qaeda . " Akram had maintained the fiction that he was a fellow Pakistani from the moment he 'd met Haq . " I keep telling you , " the man replied firmly , " the only reason I still meet with my contacts is to keep tabs on them . " " And you 're still sympathetic to their cause , are n't you ? " " Yes , I 'm ... I mean no ! I 'm not sympathetic to their cause . " Akram smiled . " I am a devout Muslim , and I am sympathetic to their cause . " He tilted his head to the side . " Are you not a devout Muslim ? " The question was a slap in the intelligence officer 's face . " Of course I am a devout Muslim , " he blurted indignantly , " but I am ... I am an officer in the ISI . I know where my allegiance lies . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akram . " The problem is that I do not know where your allegiance lies , and I 'm running out of patience . " There was no malice in his voice as he said this , merely regret . The man buried his face in his hands and shook his head . " I do n't know what to say . I am not the man you say I am . " He lifted his head and stared past the bright light at his interrogator . His eyes were glassy and pleading . " Ask my superiors . Ask General Sharif . He will tell you I was following orders . " Akram shook his head . " Your superiors have forsaken you . You are nothing but a plague to them . They claim to know very little about what you 've been up to . " " You are a liar , " spat Haq . This was exactly what Akram was after . Uncontrollable mood swings . Desperate and pleading one second and then angry and antagonistic the next . Raising his hands in surrender , Akram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no more . " I have been very patient with you , and all you do is reward me with more lies and insults . " " I have told you the truth ! " Haq said far too quickly . Akram gave him an almost paternal stare . " Would you say that I have been kind to you ? " The lack of sleep and drugs caused Haq to slip . He opened his arms and looked around the room . " Your hospitality leaves much to be desired . " In a defiant tone he said , " I want to speak with General Sharif immediately ! " " Let me ask you , Masood , how do you treat your prisoners ? " The Pakistani intelligence officer lowered his eyes to the floor , deciding it was better to ignore the question . " Have I laid a hand on you since you 've been here ? " Haq shook his head reluctantly . " Well ... all of that is about to change . " This was the first time Akram had threatened violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had consisted of Haq talking about his contacts , and going over and over the same well-rehearsed story , Haq slipping up on a few details here and there , but for the most part holding his ground . Akram studied his subject intently and said , " There is someone here who would like to see you . " Haq looked up , his eyes glimmering with hope . " No , " Akram shook his head and laughed ominously . " I do n't think you want to see this man . Continues ...
