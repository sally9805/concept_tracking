<p> TWO UPHILL TALES FROM THE BACKSTRETCH ON THE EVE OF THE 127TH PREAKNESS STAKES : <p> ******* <p> If Nancy Alberts saddles long shot Magic Weisner to victory Saturday in the $1 million Pimlico feature , her next few days are certain to be filled with calls and inquiries from the likes of Letterman , Oprah , maybe even Lifetime about a cable biopic . <p> If Magic Weisner more likely lives up to his 40-1 morning-line billing and runs up the track in the Preakness , Alberts will go back to doing what she did Thursday morning  --  taking care of her five thoroughbreds and cutting the grass at her northwest Baltimore home . <p> " Well , it needed cutting , " said Alberts , a wiry 56 , who will become only the 10th female trainer to start a horse in the second jewel of the Triple Crown . " Besides , I ca n't get around to returning all the phone calls because the phone never stops ringing . " <p> The constant ringing might be providing proper aural background to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alberts , a career racetracker , not only trains Magic Weisner , but she also bred him , owns him and once purchased his mother for $1 . <p> On top of that , she still exercises him every now and then . That happened earlier this week when unhappiness with incumbent jockey Phillip Teator led Alberts to pull the reins and replace him with New York staple Rich-ard Migliore for the mane event Saturday . <p> " It was a business decision , and the time had come to act , " said Alberts , who saddled only seven winners in 2001 . " I hated to do it and it does n't make me happy , but I have to take care of my horse and do what 's best for him . " <p> Taking care of horses has been the only professional life Alberts has known . She worked almost 30 years for trainer James Simpson on the East Coast circuits , occasionally buying one of his castoffs either to find a home for it or to try to restore it to racing fitness . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who finished fourth behind Seattle Slew in the 1977 Preakness . <p> One of Simpson 's castoffs in 1991 was a gimp-legged filly named Jazema . Her main calling card was the fact her father was Bold Forbes , the vaunted champion of the 1976 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes . Simpson sold her to Alberts for $1 . <p> After extended rehab , Alberts had Jazema back to the races . Eventually , the regal daughter started 68 times , winning 14 races and $89,199 . Twice she was claimed away , and twice Alberts brought her back . <p> When it came time to breed Jazema , Alberts recalled the filly 's endless flirting with a stablemate named Ameri Valay . <p> " They were always just eyeing each other , " Alberts said . " I was almost waiting for him to leave a box of roses and some chocolates in her stall . " <p> Eventually , their second coup-ling resulted in the Maryland-bred Magic Weisner , a foal named for the doctor  --  actually , Alan Wisner  --  who saved Alberts ' life when her spleen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The colt 's progress has been steady but exclusively regional . He broke his maiden at third asking last October at Pimlico . After an allowance victory , Magic Weisner took a big step up by winning the $100,000 Maryland Juvenile Championship on Dec. 31 at Laurel . <p> " I thought that might be the ultimate , " Alberts said . " Who could have imagined this spring ? " <p> This spring included two more Maryland-restricted stakes victories at Laurel before an open-company triumph in the $50,000 Private Terms . That set the stage for a second  --  behind New York invader Smoked ' Em  --  in the $107,000 Federico Tesio four weeks ago at Pimlico , a race that historically serves as a dream launcher for Preakness locals . <p> Now Alberts and her horse stand one mile and three-sixteenths from an improbable chunk of new Triple Crown lore . <p> " Would n't it be fun to win it and go down in history ? " Alberts asked . <p> Or at least to walk out on Letterman to something other than " A Horse With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the best young thoroughbred trainers in America that few railbirds west of the Cumberland Gap are familiar with . His horses earned more than $3 million last year . <p> Now if his Equality can make an impact in the Preakness on Saturday , which is not a stretch by any imagination , Motion will take another overdue step up the unsteady ladder of national racing renown . <p> " We have a legitimate horse in this race , " said Motion , 37 , a longtime protege of Hall of Fame trainer Jonathan Sheppard . " Everything has gone well . Equality has become acquainted with this track , and we are as ready as ready can be . " <p> Motion is as ready as ready can be to saddle with the big boys of the sport . After five years with Sheppard , he set out on a trans- Atlantic odyssey that eventually brought him from France to Maryland and the barn of local legend Bernie Bond . When Bond retired , Motion went out on his own in 1994 . <p> He had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big break came four years ago when racing managers for the prestigious Pin Oak Stable of Versailles , Ky. , decided to begin sending him horses . A past Pin Oak-bred was 1976 Preakness winner Elocutionist , who was owned by late Chicago commodities trader Gene Cashman . The farm 's newest Preakness hopeful is Equality . <p> " His progress at every turn has been encouraging , " Motion said . " Now we need some racing luck . " <p> Much more than his luck , handicapping savants have noted Motion 's patient , determined progress with the son of Mt . Livermore . A three-race fall campaign , all at Delaware Park , ended with the freshman winning a maiden race Oct. 24 . <p> In the middle of the winter at Gulfstream , Motion and Equality caught an unexpected break when an entry-level allowance was weathered off the turf . Motion kept his colt in . Under Edgar Prado , Equality won the soggy mile-and-one-sixteenth test by 161/2 lengths . <p> " That was an enormous step up , a huge eye-opener , " Motion said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffer test . " <p> That somewhere was the GradeIII Tampa Bay Derby on St. Patrick 's Day . There , Equality won by 31/4 lengths and also earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 103 . From a historical perspective , that prep figure alone suggests Equality has the natural ability to win the Preakness . <p> For a follow-up , Motion stayed south , running his nascent star in the $250,000 Aventura  --  a substitute for the old Flamingo  --  six weeks ago at Gulfstream . Badly bothered throughout , a game Equality still managed to punch back to second behind Marasca . The decision for Motion then became a difficult one  --  to enter the Kentucky Derby or not . <p> " Ambition said yes , prudence said no , " the engaging native of Great Britain said . " We decided to do what was best for the horse and aim for the Preakness . " <p> Last year , Motion saddled his first Preakness starter , sending Bay Eagle to an eighth-place finish in the 11-horse field . Now he is keenly aware of the subtle complexities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose , and only one will win , " he concluded . " But regardless , I am convinced that we are doing the right thing by giving this horse his shot here . " <p> That shot eventually could be heard at railsides everywhere west of the Cumberland Gap .
