PART ONE OF A TWO-PART SERIES // A quarter century after the first AIDS diagnosis in America , the disease has become a global pandemic , and the rates within our-community are staggering : African-Americans account for half of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses , and the disease is the leading cause of death for young Black women . ESSENCE dispatched writers and photographers across the country to gather 25 different perspectives on how HIV/AIDS has touched our lives . Standing at the crossroads of progress and pessimism , denial and truth , these sisters and brothers take a hard look at where we 've been and the long road ahead . - THE EDITORS " I thought it was ridiculous , isolating a baby like this . So I took off the mask and gloves , and I held and cuddled that child . " CHIVON MCMULLEN-JACKSON THE NURSE &gt; Chivon McMullen-Jackson , 44 , a pediatric morse in Houston , Texas , saw her first HIV-exposed baby nearly 20 years ago .

When no one was looking , I took off the mask and gloves , and I would just hold that child and cuddle her . That little girl is 16 years old now . Since I became an administrator , I do n't spend as much time with patients . But in the summer I volunteer at Camp Hope , a program that allows children with HTV to just behave like children . The saddest thing is the children whose parents have died from the disease . One year two little boys showed up and one said to the other , " My mommy and daddy are dead . " And the other little boy said , " Mine , too . " No matter what a child 's family situation is , it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having fun .

A blood transfusion left him HIV-positive . As a young man , he hid his status from women he dated . His is a cautionary tale . Growing up , I played sports , did well in school , and rarely got sick . But I hated that I had HIV . When I became sexually active with my first girlfriend , we had a few mishaps with a condom , and I knew I had to tell her . Her complete acceptance surprised me ; she still wanted to bear my children .

Since the E-mail was anonymous , administrators just told me to be careful . But I was devastated . I decided that I would never tell anyone else my status . Women never guessed ; they thought I looked too good to have HIV . I 'd mostly use a condom , but sometimes I 'd get caught up in the heat of the moment like anyone else . About two years ago , I got so tired of hiding . I got in touch with all the women Fd slept with to let them know the truth . Thank God none has ever tested positive . These days I share my experience with college students . I want them to understand that you ca n't tell if someone is infected by just looking at them . That 's why you have to practice safe sex , every time . - AS TOLD TO ZULAIKA JUMARALLI SHARON WILLIAMS THE WIFE Sharon Williams , 39 , was a soror with a master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and the perfect life . Then her husband , an Evangelical minister and a corrections officer , was diagnosed with HIV . I had been married three years when I found out my husband , now my ex , was HIV-positive . He was having breathing problems , so I checked him into the hospital . One day after church I went to see him and he said , " They think I have HIV . " Then he started to cry . I told him they must have made a mistake . But right away the pieces started coming together . Night sweats , skin rashes , weight loss-he 'd had all those symptoms . By the time my husband was released from the hospital , I had the results of my own HIV test , which was negative . But I still did n't know how he 'd contracted the disease , so I screamed , " How could you put my life in danger ?

" They feel they have no choice but to pretend they are heterosexual . I 'm sorry my ex-husband had to live in secrecy , but he put my life at risk , so that 's where it ends for me. - AS TOLD TO JEANNINE AMBER Subject 's name has been changed .

Desperately wanting to live a fall and open life , Hunter , an 18-year-old student in Los Angeles , decided she would no longer be silent . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it sometimes in the hallways . Some think I got HIV from being out there , hanging out on the streets and having unprotected sex . I try not to get caught up in what people say , because unless they get to know me , they do n't know anything . My mom was a drug user who died of AIDS when I was 5 . When I was little I was n't allowed to tell anybody that I was HIV-positive . Back then , I 'd heard about AIDS , but I did n't understand it . So , me and my big mouth , I told one of my friends that I had AIDS , and he , of course , told his parents . Other parents found out , and I was kicked out of my elementary school .

If there 's an opportunity to still live , I have to take it . In high school I decided that I did n't care what anyone thought . I sat my grandma down , and I told her , " Now it 's up to me . I 'm going to go talk to my principal and counselors and whoever . I ca n't live my life as a secret anymore .

SHERYL LEE RALPH THE WITNESS As the red curtain rises on Sheryl Lee Ralph 's one-woman show , Sometimes I Cry , the Tony-nominated actress appears onstage with a thick piece of masking tape across her mouth . Once her silence is broken , she embodies an array of characters affected by HIV/AIDS-from a Jamaican transsexual whose new life is being cut short , to a high-powered executive whose nauseating medications keep her from a life of normalcy . Losing friends to AIDS propelled me to become an activist . And I did n't lose just one friend . I lost many . This was in the early eighties at the height of the epidemic , when people just started dropping dead . There was no thought of living with the disease-they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply could not cross one more name out of my phone book . Back then there was a deafening silence about the disease , and it was not until gay men got fed up , took to the streets , and started demanding their rights that things changed . Now we 're back to where we started . This time it 's hitting the African-American community the hardest , and once again , no one is saying anything . Well , I ca n't take it anymore . This is why I created the Diva Foundation , which generates resources to fight HIV/AIDS , then my ensemble concert " Divas Simply Singing , " which has run for the past 16 years , and now my one-woman show . I use my voice to speak up and sing out about the disease because silence will not heal you or save you . I 'm talking about a revolution , a movement . I 'm talking about making a change through education and by empowering our people .

At first it was just phone calls and E-mails , but soon their relationship turned serious , complete with a marriage proposal and promises to love forever . For Louis Farmer ( far right ) , 40 , a social worker , and Derick Brown , 43 , an account manager , their commitment to each other is more important than the fact that one of them has AIDS . Farmer : Shortly after I moved to New York in 1996,1 started to get sick . I had contracted HIV from a previous long-term relationship , and one night I was having so much trouble breathing I ended up in the hospital with an oxygen mask and IVs in both my arms . The doctors called my mother and told her I was n't going to make it . She came to the hospital and started praying for me , and right away my temperature went down and I was fine . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died five years ago , did n't approve of my being gay , I know for a fact that if it were n't for her love , I would n't be here . After I recovered and moved back to Cleveland , I eventually got enough confidence to start dating again . A friend suggested I try the Internet . On my profile I said upfront that I had AIDS and that I was looking for a relationship . I got many more responses than I thought I would . One of those replies was from Derick . Before I met Derick , I had stopped taking my HIV drugs because of the side effects-I was experiencing fat deposits throughout my body and having gastrointestinal problems . But Derick really wanted me to go back on meds . He has lost so many people to the disease , I ca n't dismiss his feelings . In the past I 've dealt with men who never really cared for me . Derick is someone I know I can spend my life with . Brown : When I saw Louis 's ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being HIV-positive . I was even more intrigued when I saw his picture-he 's gorgeous . So many of us still see HIV as something to be ashamed of , but I do n't . I know HIV is an illness that can be treated . As long as you can be straightforward with me , and I know what I 'm getting myself into , I 'm pretty much okay . Louis and I expect to have good days and bad days , but the main thing is we 'll work through those hard times .

" TOM MORGAN THE SURVIVOR V Retired New York Times reporter Tom Morgan , 55 , was diagnosed with HIV in 1987 and full-blown AIDS in 1994 . He 's been close to death several times . Even during periods of relatively good health , he says he feels as if he 's walking around on shards of glass-the soles of his feet are just that sore , his body just that frail . I suspect I got AIDS from a former boyfriend . When he died in 1985 , I thought , Oh , God . I was diagnosed two years later and by the summer of 1995 I was very much at end-stage AIDS . I remember my friends and I took a vacation on Fire Island . I was so weak my legs would n't carry me the short distance down the boardwalk to our house , so they rolled me there in a cart .

I 've been hospitalized eight times in the past 12 months , and nobody can explain what 's going on . I wish I had more time to spend with my partner of 22 years .

They taught us how to identify different STDs , which STDs you can catch from oral sex , which lubricants can ruin a condom , and a lot about AIDS . It was stuff our parents did n't know , and no one else was going to tell us . It changed my perspective on everything . Now when I am with a man I do n't expect him to have a condom . I 'm responsible for my health , so I go to the store , I get the condoms , I get the lubricant , I make sure the condom 's on . It 's not as if I 'm saying , " I think you have a disease .

But when he fell back into drugs and ended up in jail , she had to let him go . A year later she received a letter that changed her life forever . Before my boyfriend and I ever had sex , he said to me , " I do n't like condoms and I 'm not going to use them .

He would write me from jail . One day I opened a letter and it said he 'd tested positive for HIV . My heart just sank . I was shocked , angry and ashamed . But my mother was so supportive . She said , " We 'll get through this but you need to get tested . " I was 26 years old . A week later I learned I had HIV . Looking back I realize there had been warning signs .

With his wife , Deborah Davenport , and his daughter , Tamachia Davenport , he runs St. John 's AIDS outreach ministry , which in 1993 became the first church-based AIDS project in New Orleans to be granted city funding . Our youth director was a gay man so afraid of being cast out that he did n't tell anyone he had full-blown AIDS until he was in the hospital . Our church just embraced him .

I spend most of my time on the road trying to build a Black mobilization movement . If Black America has learned nothing in the last few years , we should have at least learned that we have to take care of ourselves . seele : The way we address HIV has to do with our relationship with God . Do we see God as an inclusive father-mother where everybody has a place in the kingdom ? Or do we see God as a hellacious person who punishes you ?
