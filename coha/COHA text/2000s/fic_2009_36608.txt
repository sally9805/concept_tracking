1 <p> Vampirism : ( n ) 1 . The condition of being a vampire , marked by the need to ingest blood and extreme vulnerability to sunlight . 2 . The act of preying upon others for financial or emotional gain . 3 . A gigantic pain in the butt . <p> I 've always been a glass-half-full kind of girl . <p> The irritated look from Gary , the barrel-chested bartender at Shenanigans , told me that , one , I 'd said that out loud , and , two , he just did n't care . But at that point , I was the only person sitting at the pseudo-sports bar on a Wednesday afternoon , and I did n't have the cognitive control required to stop talking . So he had no choice but to listen . <p> I picked up the remnants of my fourth ( fifth ? sixth ? ) electric lemonade . It glowed blue against the neon lights of Shenanigans ' insistently cheerful decor , casting a green shadow on Gary 's yellow-and-white-striped polo shirt . " See this glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't half empty . It 's half full . And I was used to that . My whole life has been half full . Half-full family , half-full personal life , half-full career . But I settled for it . I was used to it . Did I already say that I was used to it ? " <p> Gary , a gone-to-seed high-school football player with a gut like a deflated balloon , gave me a stern look over the pilsner he was polishing . " Are you done with that ? " <p> I drained the watered-down vodka and blue liqueur from my glass , wincing as the alcohol hit the potato skins in my belly . Both threatened to make an encore appearance . <p> I steadied myself on the ring-stained maple bar and squinted through the icy remains of the glass . " And now , my career is gone . Gone , gone , gone . Completely empty . Like this glass . " <p> Gary replaced said glass with another drink , pretended to wave at someone in the main dining room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead to the cool wood of the bar , cringing as I remembered the smug , **28;316;TOOLONG tone Mrs. Stubblefield used to say , " Jane , I need to speak to you privately . " <p> For the rest of my life , those words would echo through my head like something out of Carrie . <p> With a loud " ahem , " Mrs. Stubblefield motioned for me to leave my display of Amelia Bedelia books and come into her office . Actually , all she did was quirk her eyebrows . But the woman had a phobia about tweezers . When she was surprised/angry/curious , it looked as if a big gray moth was taking flight . Quirking her brows was practically sign language . <p> My joyless Hun of a supervisor only spoke to people privately when they were in serious trouble . Generally , she enjoyed chastising in public in order to ( a ) show the staff just how badly she could embarrass us if she wanted to and ( b ) show the public how put-upon she was by her rotten , incompetent employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . We got off on the wrong foot when I made fun of the Mother Goose hat she wore for Toddler Story Hour . I was four . <p> She was the type of librarian who has " Reading is supposed to be educational , not fun " tattooed somewhere . She refused to order DVDs or video games that might attract " the wrong crowd . " ( Translation : teenagers . ) She allowed the library to stock " questionable " books such as The Catcher in the Rye and the Harry Potter series but tracked who read them . She kept those names in a file marked " Potential Troublemakers . " <p> " Close the door , Jane , " she said , squeezing into her desk chair . Mrs. Stubblefield was about one cheek too large for it but refused to order another one . A petty part of me enjoyed her discomfort while I prepared for a lecture on appropriate displays for Banned Books Week or why we really do n't need to stock audiobooks on CD . <p> " As you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty percent for the next fiscal year , " Mrs. Stubblefield said . " That leaves us with less money for new selections and new programs . " <p> " I 'd be willing to give up Puppet Time Theater on Thursdays , " I offered . I secretly hated Cowboy Bob and his puppets . <p> I have puppet issues . <p> " I 'm afraid it 's more serious than that , Jane , " Mrs. Stubblefield said , her eyes flitting to the glass door behind me . " We have to reduce our salary expenses as well . I 'm afraid we ca n't afford a director of juvenile services anymore . We 're going to have to let you go . " <p> Maybe some of you saw that coming , but I did n't . I got my master 's degree in library science knowing I would come back to " my " library , even if it meant working with Mrs. Stubblefield . I 'm the one who established the library 's book club for new mothers who desperately needed to leave the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm also the reason a small portion of the Hollow 's female population now knows that Sense and Sensibility was a book before it was a movie . I 'm the one who insisted we start doing background checks on our Story Time guests , which is why Jiggles the Clown was no longer welcome on the premises . I 'm the one who spent two weeks on my knees ripping out the thirty-three-year-old carpet in the children 's reading room . Me . So , after hearing that my services were no longer needed , I had no response other than " Huh ? ! " <p> " I 'm sorry , Jane , but we have no other choice . We must be careful stewards of the taxpayers ' money , " Mrs. Stubblefield said , shaking her head in mock regret . She was trying to look sympathetic , but her eyebrows were this close to doing the samba . <p> " Ida is retiring next month , " I said of the ancient returns manager . " Ca n't we save the money through eliminating her position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to argue , which proved that she never paid attention when I spoke . Her eyebrows beat twice , which I took as code for " Just leave quietly . " <p> " I do n't understand , " I continued . " My performance reviews have been nothing but positive . Juvenile circulation has increased thirty-two percent since I was hired . I work weekends and nights when everyone else is too busy or sick . This place is my whole ... What the hell are you looking at ? " <p> I turned to see Mrs. Stubblefield 's stepdaughter , Posey , standing near the main desk . Posey waved , her bagged lunch bobbing merrily . Something told me she was n't just early for a picnic with her wicked stepmother . Posey was virtually unemployable since she 'd set fire to the Pretty Paws Pet Grooming Salon while blow-drying Bitty Wade 's teacup poodle . Apparently , doggie nail polish , heat elements , and long-haired breeds are a cataclysmic combination.This was the third job Posey had lost due to fire , including blazes started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee pot at the Coffee Spot . When Posey was n't working , she moved back into her dad 's house , which also happened to be Mrs. Stubblefield 's house . Clearly , my boss had decided she could share a water cooler with Posey but not a bathroom . <p> I was being replaced . Replaced by someone who needed flash cards to understand the Dewey decimal system . Replaced with someone I 'd hated on principle since the sixth grade , when she penned the following in my honor : " Roses are red , violets are black . Why is your front as flat as your back ? " Thanks to middle-school politics , I was labeled " Planed Jane " until my senior-year growth spurt . Regarding the use of " planed , " I believe one of Posey 's smarter friends showed her how to use a thesaurus . <p> Posey spotted me and froze mid-wave . I uttered several of the seven words you 're not supposed to say in polite company . My soon-to-be-former boss let out an indignant huff . " Honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that language to work around children . " <p> " You ca n't fire me , " I told her . " I 'll appeal to the library board . " <p> " Who do you think signed your termination notice ? " Mrs. Stubblefield preened while sliding the paper toward me . <p> I snatched it off her desk . " Your crony , Mrs. Newsome , signed the termination notice . That 's not quite the same thing . " <p> " She got approval from the other board members , " Mrs. Stubblefield said . " They were very sorry to see you go , but the truth is , we just ca n't afford you . " <p> " But you can afford Posey ? " <p> " Posey is starting as a part-time desk clerk . The salaries are n't comparable . " <p> " She starts fires ! " I hissed . " Books tend to be kind of flammable ! " <p> Ignoring me , Mrs. Stubblefield reached into a drawer to remove an envelope , which I hoped included a handsome severance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one large , ugly dog without bringing home a paycheck . <p> The final indignity was Mrs. Stubblefield handing me a banker 's box already packed with my " personal effects . " I stumbled through the lobby on legs that threatened to buckle under me . I ignored the cheerful greetings from patrons , knowing I would burst into tears at the first face I recognized . <p> I got into my car , leaned my forehead against the white-hot steering wheel , and began to hyperventilate . After about an hour of that , I mopped my blotchy face on my sleeve and opened what I thought was my severance check . Instead , a bright yellow-and-white-striped slip of paper drifted into my passenger seat , shouting , " Twenty-five dollars ! Plus free potato skins ! " in huge red letters . <p> Instead of a severance check , I got a gift certificate to Shenanigans . <p> This prompted another hour or so of hysterical crying . I finally pulled myself together enough to pull out of the library parking lot and drive toward the mall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Half-Moon Hollow after the county commission finally unclenched its " dry " status . After decades of driving over county lines to Maynard to get liquor by the drink , Half-Moon Hollow residents could finally enjoy cocktails close enough to walk home drunk instead of drive . Personally , I find that comforting . <p> McClure County was one of the last counties in the state where you could legally smoke in restaurants  --  thank you , local tobacco farmers  --  so the bar was cloaked in several layers of cigarette haze . I made myself comfortable on a bar stool , ordered some potato skins and a large electric lemonade . For those unfamiliar with the beverage , picture a glass of Country Time that looks like Windex and makes your face numb . After the gift certificate ran out , I handed my Visa to Gary the bartender and told him to start a tab . I switched to mudslides sometime around happy hour . An " I 'm too tired to cook " crowd trickled in after dusk . Unfortunately , this crowd included Adam Morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day bear ... if I ever worked up the nerve to talk to him . <p> I 've had a crush on Adam since elementary school , when he sat beside me in homeroom . ( Thank you , alphabetical order . ) When we were kids , he looked like Joey McIntyre from New Kids on the Block , which is like preteen-girl kryptonite . And Adam was one of the few people who never called me Planed Jane , so double points for him . We moved in different circles in high school . OK , we were barely in the same building . He was the dimpled football hero with a mysterious dash of debate-team participation . I spent lunch breaks shelving library books for extra Key Club points . I did n't see him while we were away at college , but I like to think it means something that we both came home to Half-Moon Hollow . I like to think that he values his roots and wants to give back to his hometown . And that it makes me less of a loser for living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Adam 's a veterinarian now . He makes his living curing puppies . I 'm a woman of uncomplicated tastes . <p> Adam smiled at me from across the bar , but he did n't come over . It was just as well , since ( a ) he probably did n't remember my name , and ( b ) I might have melted off my bar stool into a puddle of hammered , unemployed hussy . Plus , I have had the same reaction around Adam since our very first elementary-school encounter . Total lockjaw . I can not speak normal sentences . I can only smile , drool , and burble like an idiot ... which was pretty much what I was doing at the time . <p> Had I not suffered enough already ? <p> I considered cutting my losses and scuttling home , but I did not need to add " blackout drunk driver " to my already tattered reputation . Nestled in a crook ofthe Kentucky-Ohio River border , Half-Moon Hollow is not one of those stereotypical Southern towns where everybody knows everybody , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet around in his pocket . We had the second stoplight installed last year . And do n't call it a " holler , " or I will personally track you down and hurt you . <p> Of the ten thousand or so people who live in this town , I am on a first-namebasis with or related to about half . And if I do n't know you , I know your cousins . Or my parents know you , your parents , or your parents ' cousins . So I was caught off guard when a complete stranger materialized on the bar stool next to me . <p> " Hi , " I said . Actually , I think I yelled in a too-loud drunk voice . " That was ... unexpected . " <p> " It usually is , " said Mr. Tall , Dark , and Yummy . He asked the bartender for the Tequila Sunrise Special and was served in record time . As I stared at the maroon cloud swirling in the bottom of his glass , he asked if I would like another drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , in what I 'm sure I thought was a whisper . " I probably need to switch to coffee if I 'm going to get home tonight . " <p> His hesitant smile showed perfectly even , almost unnaturally white teeth . He probably suffers an addiction to tooth whitener , I mused . He seemed to take pretty good care of his skin as well . Hair : longish , winding in dark , curling locks from a slight widow 's peak to his strong , square chin . Eyes : deep gray , almost silver , with a dark charcoal ring around the irises . Clothes : dark , well cut , and out of place in the Shenanigans crowd . Preliminary judgment : definitely a metrosexual , possibly gay , with a spontaneous yen for mozzarella sticks . <p> " What 's your name ? " Mr. Yummy asked , signaling the bartender to get me a cup of coffee . <p> " Jane Jameson , " I said , extending my hand . He shook it with hands that were smooth and cool . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started to babble . " It 's mind-blowingly boring , I know . Why do n't I just go completely bland and change my last name to Smith or Blank ? Or why not do the mature thing and go by my middle name ? Well , you 'd have to be crazy to go by my middle name . " <p> " And what is that ? " he asked . <p> " Enid , " I said , grimacing . " After a distant relative . My dad thought it was really original because no one else had a daughter named Enid . I guess it had n't occurred to him why nobody else had a daughter named Enid . I think Mama was still hopped up on the epidural , because she agreed to it . " <p> " Purity , " he said . I think I squinted at him , because he repeated himself . " ' Enid ' is Welsh in origin . It means ' purity ' or ' soul . ' " <p> " It also meant there were a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school , " I muttered sulkily . The coffee was a bitter black jolt to the system after frothy frozen cocktails . I shuddered . " Graduations were hell . " <p> He paused for a moment and then laughed , a good explosion of honest , barking laughter . It sounded rusty , as if he had n't done that in a while . <p> " Jane Enid Jameson , my name is Gabriel Nightengale , " he said . " I would very much like to keep you company until you are able to drive home . " <p> I wish I could remember that first conversation with Gabriel , but Mighty Lord Kahlua prevents it . From what I can piece together , I gave him the gory details of my firing . I think I impressed him by explaining that the term firing came from ancient Britannic clans . When village elders wanted to get rid of someone , instead of accusing him of witchcraft or shunning him , they would burn down the undesirable 's house and force him to move on . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just does . <p> We eventually wandered into a discussion of English literature . Gabriel expressed affection for Robert Burns , whom I deemed " too lazy to spell correctly . " I would feel bad , but he called my beloved Ms. Austen a " repressed , uptight spinster . " I was provoked . We called a truce and decided to discuss a much more neutral subject , religion . <p> It took several hours , but I sobered up considerably . Still , I was reluctant to leave . Here was a person who did n't know me before my life was turned upside down . He could n't compare the before and after Jane . he did n't know me well enough to feel sorry for me . He only knew this slightly tipsy girl who seemed to amuse him . <p> And there was something compelling about my new friend . My nerve endings telegraphed " Run , stupid , run ! " messages to my brain , but I ignored them . Even if I ended up chained in his secret basement dungeon ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to work the next day . <p> When the bartender yelled " Last call , " Gabriel walked me to my car . There was an uncomfortable second when I thought ( hoped ) he might kiss me . He was staring at my mouth with a sort of hunger that made me feel light and giddy . After a few agonizing seconds , he sighed , opened my car door , and wished me good night . <p> I drove slowly along Route 161 , pondering my drinking buddy 's apparent indifference . Had I ever been the type of girl who got picked up in bars ? Well , no . I am the designated girl buddy . If I had a nickel for every time I heard the words " I do n't want to ruin our friendship , " I would n't be driving a car with an ominously flashing " check engine " light . <p> As I passed High Station Road , the taste of coffee and mudslides bubbled at the back of my throat with threatening velocity . I vurped up essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night off by vomiting . " <p> Then Big Bertha 's engine rattled and died . <p> " Aw , crap , " I moaned , thunking my head against the wheel . I did not relish the idea of walking alone at night on the proverbial dark country road . But Half-Moon Hollow had two towing garages , both of which closed after eight p.m . I did n't have much of a choice . Plus , there was also the tiniest possibility that I still had alcohol in my system , so calling the police or AAA was not a greatidea . <p> So , out of my car I climbed , grumbling about useless machines and blowtorch revenge . I was wearing open-toed sandals , very sensible shoes when one is schlepping toward a hatchet-wielding , woods-dwelling maniac . I spent every other step kicking bits of gravel out of my shoes , knowing that it was forming impenetrable gray cement between my toes . I passed roadside banks of wild day lilies , their orange lips clenched shut against the night , their heavy heads leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my evening , I was going to have to check myself for ticks when I got home . <p> The one thing I had going for me was good night vision . I thought so right up until I fell face-first into a ditch . <p> " Seriously ? " I yelled at the sky . " Come on ! " <p> Swiping at the mud on my face and the stones embedded in my knees , I made more creative use of those seven words you do n't say in polite company . Lights fanned over me . I spun toward the noise of a moving vehicle , wondering whether it was wise to wave and ask for help . Without warning , I felt a hot punch to my side . My lungs were on fire . I could n't catch my breath . I pressed a palm against my ribs and felt warm gushes of blood spilling out onto the grass . <p> " Aw , crap , " was all I could manage before falling back into the ditch . <p> You 're probably wondering what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness that cradled me like warm , wet cotton , I thought , Was that it ? Was that my whole life ? I 'm born . I have an unfortunate permed-bangs era . I 'm fired . I die ? <p> I remember being so sorry that I was n't able to say good-bye to my family or at least give Adam Morrow a kiss that would have left him inconsolable at my funeral . I was also very sorry about my choice of last words . <p> Then the movie started . The whole tunnel-of-light thing is a hallucination , but near-death experience survivors are n't lying when they say your life flashes before your eyes . It 's kind of a fast-forwarded highlight reel complete with hokey music . My soundtrack was a Muzak version of " Butterfly Kisses , " which is something that I will take to my grave . <p> The This Is Your Life flashbacks allow you to watch yourself being born and dying and all the moments in between . Sitting in church in torturously starched tights , first days of school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exams , each precious bubble of time slipping from you even as you try to grasp and hold on . Some moments you 'd rather forget , such as throwing up on the school bus or the time you skipped your grandpa 's funeral to go to the water park with your friends . ( I swear , I 'll explain that one later . ) <p> Near the end of my reel , I watched myself talking to Gabriel and wished I had more time with him . I saw us leaving the bar and my car crawling toward home . I saw a close-up of Bud " Wiser " McElray driving his beat-up red truck down the highway about two miles behind me , drinking his favored Bud Light . I watched my own masterful use of obscenities as I climbed out of my stalled car , Bud following me . I watched as I face-planted into the ditch  --  which , I have to admit , even I laughed at . There was a wide shot as Bud caught my hunched , muddied form in his headlights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the screen as Bud reached for the rifle behind his seat . <p> " Could be an eight-pointer , " Bud mumbled , rolling down his passenger window . Another close-up of Bud 's face as he squinted in concentration . His finger squeezed the trigger . I screamed at the screen as I watched myself fall to my knees , utter my oh-so-auspicious epitaph , and slump back into the ditch . Believing he 'd missed his quarry , Bud put his truck in gear and lumbered away . <p> I screamed . " He thought I was a freaking deer ? " <p> So , that 's how I died . A drunk was driving along Route 161 and decided to do some from-the-truck deer hunting . Instead of a nice buck to put up on his wall , he shot a recently fired , far-too-sober-to-die librarian . <p> In the theater of my dying brain , the highlight reel came to a close . I was cold and tired . And then I woke up as one of the undead . <p> Copyright 2009 by Molly Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
