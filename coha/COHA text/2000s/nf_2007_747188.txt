Bright daylight lighting . TOUR GUIDE is holding a clipboard and some maps . She is standing before a simple block of granite , which measures 4 ' by 4 ' by 4 ' , and features a small plaque bearing an inscription in unreadably small letters . She checks her watch . A tourist couple arrives . MALE TOURIST has a camera around his neck . TOUR GUIDE <p> Morning . Are you here for the walking tour ? FEMALE TOURIST <p> We are . Hi . TOUR GUIDE <p> Great . Hi . Have you done walking tours before ? MALE TOURIST <p> What time is it ? TOUR GUIDE <p> It 's almost time . In fact , why do n't we get going . Now , can either of you tell me what this is , that we 're standing before ? ( Pause . ) No ? MALE TOURIST <p> It 's a monument . TOUR GUIDE <p> It 's a monument , yes . To honor the founding of our town . So that we may never forget . FEMALE TOURIST <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moment . MALE TOURIST <p> We went to Rome , last summer . FEMALE TOURIST <p> In search of eternal truth , and , to be honest , for the food . TOUR GUIDE <p> I 'd love to go to Italy . Rome is so old . I bet you saw some monuments there . MALE TOURIST <p> The whole place is history . FEMALE TOURIST <p> We walked everywhere . I think we saw all the famous things . A lot of the inscriptions are chipped off or eroded . And they 're in Latin , so even if they were readable , you ca n't read them . MALE TOURIST <p> It 's a dead language . <p> TOUR GUIDE <p> ( Referring to the monument . ) This is in English , so people can enjoy it for years to come . FEMALE TOURIST <p> What about when English dies ? TOUR GUIDE <p> Oh , I think English ' 11 be around for a pretty long time . FEMALE TOURIST <p> I doubt the Romans thought Latin was going anywhere , either . MALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Portugal was a world power , a glorious empire . Portugal . As in : ( He elongates the word , as a European football announcer would do : ) " Gooooaaaalllll ! " Times change . People change . Empires . So I 'm wary of monuments . FEMALE TOURIST <p> He likes statues of horses , but , just the horse , no rider . MALE TOURIST <p> True . Incredible animal . Very proud and noble . I used to gamble , the ponies . Lost my job , my previous wife , long story . I had big dark circles under my eyes . But I still love horses . Statues of horses . ( Gesturing toward monument . ) Anyway , yeah , this makes me feel sad and beautiful , but not that sad and beautiful . ( Brief pause . ) We 've gone all around the known world , with our cameras and sensible shoes . We 've walked a hundred cities , ridden busses with chickens , taken ferries drunk at night over rough northern seas . ( Nodding toward FEMALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rented a three-wheeled car . FEMALE TOURIST <p> Just because we do n't look like pilgrims does n't mean we 're not pilgrims . MALE TOURIST <p> And so now , here we are . For some local truth . Here we are . Forget everything you were going to tell us . I understand why you 'd think we 're just yahoos on vacation . But , we 're serious people . TOUR GUIDE <p> No , of course you are . ( Pause . ) I 'm not sure what you - I mean , I do n't know . I give this tour every day . I normally think about lunch or looking for another job , not the next ten thousand years . So you 've sort of caught me off-I mean , what am I supposed to say ? It 's just pretty regular , it 's pretty everyday , around here . We do n't have any stat - MALE TOURIST <p> ( Interrupting . ) I 'm not trying to be difficult . FEMALE TOURIST <p> ( Looking at monument . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad . ( To MALE TOURIST : ) But I can see what you 're saying . ( To TOUR GUIDE : ) I guess we just like a little perspective with our history . A little , like , gossipy footnote about a local dish or a bastard child . TOUR GUIDE <p> I still really do n't know what to . ( Pause . ) I grew up here . ( Referring to monument . ) This was just always - I do n't know - There . Or , Here . I just trusted it was important . I 'd see it in the rain and snow . A granite block in the sun , glowing under the moon . So that we remember , I guess . In general . So that we have memories . FEMALE TOURIST <p> ( Encouragingly . ) This is a new thought . TOUR GUIDE <p> I have n't really traveled , you know . I 'll walk around town , I 'll notice some little thing , " Hey , was that always here ? " Main Street , Elm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my secret thoughts , private theories on things . I grew up here . I thought this was the world . MALE TOURIST <p> ( Encouragingly . ) Of course you did . That 's all right . But , hey , let me get a quick picture of you being wrong . ( MALE TOURIST snaps a photo of TOUR GUIDE . ) FEMALE TOURIST <p> I guess it 's just that there 's a long history of death in both our families , so , we always sort of want something more . The strange wrong angle , the restricted view . We like things that are potentially monumental , but that are n't necessarily monumentalized . TOUR GUIDE <p> Well , then , I do n't know - ( Looking around , motioning around . ) I guess then maybe that 's everything else . Technically . ( Referring to the monument . ) Other than this . FEMALE TOURIST <p> ( Interested in the possibility . ) Huh . MALE TOURIST <p> Could be , could be . Go on . ( He takes a photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward nothing in particular . While this is happening , MRS . SWANSON enters , and , wondering what is going on , stands near the group . ) TOUR GUIDE <p> For instance , this air . I wrote on it in school . Take a deep breath . ( They do . ) Hundreds of years ago , someone was digging a hole here , for this very monument , and he rested on his shovel and sighed . You just inhaled a molecule of the air that that shoveler exhaled , in that quiet sigh long ago . Scientific truth . And he , hundreds of years ago , had just inhaled a molecule of air from Caesar 's dying breath . Which dying breath might have also contained one Caesar had exhaled in his first screaming breath when he was born . You never know . Molecules . Not the prettiest word . ( Brief pause . ) But think of how personal everything is . Think of a beautiful sunset on Earth , before human beings had ever evolved . It just beautifully sets . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahhh , " or make some breathy sound , move the air around . It just beautifully sets , nothing personal . ( To MRS . SWANSON : ) Hello . ( Back to the others : ) Beneath us , the dirt that sighing man was digging in to . It 's layers of fossils and broken pottery and things they think had religious value . City , then ash ; town , then dirt ; village , then ice and lead . Maybe a little piece of cloth or a bone . It 's people strewn all the way through . Some of the dust on my shoes is from outer space ; most of the rest is dead human skin . You look at it , the general surface , and you think , " Dirt . " That 's not even half the story . ( JOHN DODGE enters , on the other side of the stage , carrying a small plastic shopping bag . He stops and looks inside it , looks around , checks his pockets . ) And there 's a person , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of completes the scene . TOUR GUIDE <p> Does it ? That would be nice . MALE TOURIST <p> ( Taking a photograph of JOHN DODGE . ) Look at him . Classic . MRS . SWANSON <p> ( She sees that it is JOHN DODGE . Waving : ) John ? ( She leaves the little group , acknowledging them as she goes . ) Excuse me . Hi . TOUR GUIDE <p> ( To MRS . SWANSON , as she leaves : ) Hi . Bye . ( Brief pause . ) Now , there 's a meadow we could walk to . Just nice grass and trees . It 's quiet , nothing noticeably historical going on . The Kwerassi Indian believed trees were gods . They thought everything was . So that whatever you were doing , no matter what you were doing , you were praying . We could sit for a while . FEMALE TOURIST <p> That sounds perfect . ( To MALE TOURIST . ) Et tu , Brute ? MALE TOURIST <p> Great . ( They look at MRS . SWANSON and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the monument and around the stage . ) You know what , I need more film . ( They exit . ) <p> Author 's Note : This scene happens about halfway through the first of the two acts of Middletown . If Hamlet could be described as a play about a castle , then Middletown could be similarly described as a play about a town . It is centered mainly on two of its residents : JOHN DODGE , who 's always lived there , and MRS . SWANSON , who 's just moved there . The above scene comes a few scenes after the two have first met and just prior to their second meeting . The " Walking Tour " scene is meant to quietly dramatize the movement of the play away from a normative history of a geographical locale , and , toward a more secretive , or , difficult history . <p> The central object of the scene changes from a blocky granite monument to a quiet sigh made by an unknown man hundreds of years ago . Ideally , in terms of its effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy over all that follows . Ideally , it would cause in the audience a feeling of endless and mysterious connectedness , a sense of the sacredness and strangeness of simple times and places . For instance , the first breath or the last breath , both of which the play will have . <p> I began to write this scene while I was teaching in Princeton , NJ . I lived on Greenview Avenue , right across from the Princeton Cemetery . It was almost like a kind of research , staring at the gravestones . They are out there , year in , year out . The flowers and visitors come and go . I would sit on the porch and look over there . It was very easy to imagine and then sympathize with the character of the TOUR GUIDE . To imagine and sympathize with someone standing next to a silent rock monument signifying a moment of life long ago , and wanting to find something lively and humane and present to say . <p> By Will Eno <p> <p> Will Eno , a playwright , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy and Lewis B.
