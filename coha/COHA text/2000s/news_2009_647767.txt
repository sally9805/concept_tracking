The MS Explorer was purpose-built for the Antarctic , a nimble expedition cruise ship with an ice-reinforced hull that pioneered the polar tourism trade in the early 1970s . <p> But on Nov. 23 , 2007 , she sank in what appeared to be the most routine of Antarctic circumstances : cruising through young pack ice in mild weather . <p> The 154 passengers and crewmen aboard were plucked unharmed from open lifeboats by other cruise ships the following day , just two hours before gale-force winds struck the area . <p> Until now , the causes of the ship 's sinking have remained a mystery , with her owners , Toronto-based G.A.P Adventures , refusing to comment beyond initial reports that she struck submerged ice and succumbed to uncontrollable flooding . <p> But last week the results of an official investigation became public . It places blame on the captain having misjudged ice conditions and the failure of one of the ships watertight doors . <p> The report by the Liberian Bureau of Maritime Affairs , through which the Explorer was flagged , described how the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one passenger described as " a long wall of solid ice , " presumably a ridge of broken ice forced up by pressure . <p> The report - which vividly illustrated how a single misjudgment can lead to disaster in the harsh , poorly charted waters of Antarctica - made a series of recommendations to improve safety on polar cruises . Among them : that these ships carry at least partially-enclosed lifeboats and enough immersion suits for everyone aboard , and that training requirements for ice navigation be better spelled out . Currently , the International Maritime Organization does n't have formal competency training requirements for ice navigators . <p> Mind the glacial ice chunks <p> A Chilean naval icebreaker that reached the scene shortly after the Explorer 's passengers were rescued , concluded that the ship had not been traveling through a thin ice field , as her captain had thought , but rather an older , thicker field containing a mix of dangerous glacial ice chunks , some reportedly as large as 15 feet high with underwater rams as long as 45 feet . <p> The Explorer " sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven feet along her hull and sank because flooding could not be contained within the affected watertight compartment , the report said . Crew members told investigators that a hatch between engine rooms turned out to have faulty seals , allowing other parts of the ship to flood . <p> The report concluded that Bengt Wiman , on his first Antarctic cruise as captain , " transited the ice field with an overconfident attitude regarding the capabilities of the Explorer and , in all likelihood , struck the ' wall of ice at a rate of speed that was excessive . " <p> Tighter rules for Antarctic ships <p> The report was released as representatives of the 45 signatory nations to the Antarctica Treaty were attending their annual meeting in Baltimore where they tightened some regulations on cruise ships . The Explorer report caused " a big shock " at the meeting , says James Barnes , executive director of the Washington-based Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition . <p> " There was great surprise at the realities revealed by the report compared to the information that had been available before from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Everybody is congratulating Liberia for what is a most thorough report , but if the ship 's owners had released this information right away , we could have gotten to work on addressing this 18 months ago . " <p> Steve Wellmeier , executive director of the International Association of Antarctic Tourism Operators describes the report as " very sobering reading " which " represents a wake-up call for all of our members . " <p> Ship owners dispute findings <p> But the founder and CEO of G.A.P . Adventures , Bruce Poon Tip , expresses dissatisfaction with the investigation . " We dispute pretty much everything in the report , " he says , but declines to offer his own version of events or to respond point by point to the report 's findings . " They are entitled to their opinions , but I am not interested in getting into an argument with a flag state . " <p> Mr. Poon Tip says that Liberia 's investigators had " come to these outrageous conclusions " without ever speaking with anyone in his company . On further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had corresponded with G.A.P 's attorneys and conducted telephone or e-mail interviews with some of the Explorer 's officers and crew who no longer work for the company , including Captain Wiman . <p> Poon Tip does not directly answer questions about the causes of the Explorer 's sinking , confining his answers to the quality of the company 's rescue effort . <p> " We 're very proud and happy about how it went , " he says . " We got everyone out of there safely and everyone in the world has been nothing but complimentary about how the company handled the situation . " <p> Praise for the captain and crew <p> The report also praised the captain for his decision to evacuate the passengers to lifeboats early in the incident , before the crippled ship drifted back into the ice field , where lifeboats would have been difficult or impossible to deploy . The chief engineer was commended for jury-rigging a fuel supply for an auxiliary generator , which allowed the captain to maneuver the ship into a position where the lifeboats could be deployed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help , but were told each time " to call back . " Fortunately , they were able to make contact with nearby cruise ships themselves . <p> There have been several serious incidents involving Antarctic cruise ships in recent years . In January 2007 , all 371 people were evacuated from the MS Nordkapp after it ran aground . That December the MS Fram lost power and smashed into a glacier , forcing an abrupt return to South America . This past December , 122 passengers and crew were rescued from the MV Ushuaia after it struck a rock in Antarctica 's Gerlache Strait . And on Feb 19 , 105 people had to be rescued when the US-operated Ocean Nova ran aground in heavy winds . <p> Delegates to the Antarctica Treaty meeting approved a resolution that bans vessels carrying more than 500 passengers from conducting landings in Antarctica . In recent years , Princess Cruise Lines has sent its 109,000-ton megaships Golden Princess and Star Princess to the Antarctic , even though neither is ice-reinforced . Each carries more than 3,500 passengers and crew . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone knows that there is n't the capacity in Antarctica to deal with an emergency like that , " says Barnes . " Those vessels should not come into ice infested waters at all . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
