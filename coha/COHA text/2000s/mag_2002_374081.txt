Inside the Womb <P> These superb pictures brilliantly illustrate the miracle of the earliest days of life  --  our very first photo album ! ROSE MCBRIDE SAMRA Portage , Mich . <P> I am nine months pregnant , and i was totally mesmerized by your report SCIENCE , Nov. 11 . The pictures of a baby 's brain , heart , stomach , umbilical cord and other major organs were amazing . This is our first baby ( it 's a boy ) , and to see all of what 's growing inside me was a blessing from God . JENNIFER BARNARD Apple Valley , Calif . <P> Thank you so much for the fascinating images and the article " Inside the Womb . " As a registered nurse , I can appreciate the importance of these pictures and the story , especially for teaching my teenage friends . High-quality information presented in easily understood language is a valuable aid to remind the young to think before they act . MARJORIE HARCK , R.N.

Michele Salvatore New York City <P> Regardless of anyone 's stance on abortion , one fact has become clear , as you stated : " No matter what the species , nature uses virtually the same nails and screws , the same hammers and power tools to put an embryo together . " With this knowledge under our belt , it is irresponsible if not morally reprehensible for us to continue exploiting other species for our selfish purposes . Whether we slaughter animals for food , skin them for clothing or goad them into entertaining us at the circus , we can no longer deny our kinship with them . CHRISTINA J.

GREG HURD Santa Rosa , Calif . <P> The Gathering Gloom <P> In his piece about the early onset of darkness , Walter Kirn calls for an emergency extension of daylight saving time ( DST ) so it will be light later ESSAY , Nov. 11 . Unlike Kirn , I 'm glad dst is over . Without sunlight , I had trouble waking up and facing a new day 's challenges . An extra hour of light in the afternoon does n't really do any good . Who is going to take a walk in diminishing sunlight when it 's almost freezing outside ? Extending DST is not going to change people 's perception of winter very much . Winter is n't a gloomy time ; it enables us to look forward to spring . If Kirn wants a new calendar , he should be looking into the Chinese lunar calendar , in which spring starts promptly on Jan. 1 .
