They took Norma off the air that Tuesday morning because a boy was dropped off at the station . He was quiet and thin and had a note . The receptionists let him through . A meeting was called . The conference room was full of light and had an expansive view of the city , looking east toward the mountains . When Norma walked in , Elmer was seated at the head of the table , rubbing his face as if he 'd been woken from a restless , unsatisfying sleep . He nodded as she sat , then yawned and fiddled with the top of a pill bottle he 'd taken from his pocket . " Go for some water , " he groaned to his assistant . " And empty these ashtrays , Len . Jesus . " The boy sat across from Elmer , in a stiff wooden chair , staring down at his feet . He was slender and fragile , and his eyes were too small for his face . His head had been shaved -- to kill lice , Norma supposed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His shirt was threadbare , and his unhemmed pants were knotted around his waist with a shoestring . Norma sat closest to him , her back to the door , facing the white city . Len reappeared with a pitcher of water . It was choked with bubbles , tinged gray . Elmer poured himself a glass and swallowed two pills . He coughed into his hand . " Let 's get right to it , " Elmer said when Len had sat . " We 're sorry to interrupt the news , Norma , but we wanted you tomeet Victor . " " Tell her how old you are , boy , " Len said . " I 'm eleven , " the child said , his voice barely audible . " And a half . " Len cleared his throat , glanced at Elmer , as if for permission to speak . With a nod from his boss , he began . " That 's a terrific age , " Len said . " Now , you came looking for Norma , is n't that right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him ? " Norma did n't . " He says he came from the jungle , " Len continued . " We thought you 'd want to meet him . For the show . " " Great , " she said . " Thank you . " Elmer stood and walked to the window . He was a silhouette against the hazy brightness . Norma knew that panorama : the city below , stretching to the horizon and still farther . With your forehead to the glass , you could see down to the street , to that broad avenue choked with traffic and people , with buses and moto-taxis and vegetable carts . Or life on the city 's rooftops : clothes hanging on a line next to rusting chicken coops , old men playing cards on a milk crate , dogs barking angrily , teeth bared at the heavy sea air . She 'd even seen a man once , sitting on his yellow hard hat , sobbing . If Elmer saw anything now , he did n't seem interested . He turned back to them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norma sat up straight . " What are you telling me , Elmer ? " It was one of the rumors they knew to be true : mass graves , anonymous villagers , murdered and tossed into ditches . They 'd never reported it , of course . No one had . They had n't spoken of this in years . She felt something heavy in her chest . " It 's probably nothing , " Elmer said . " Let 's show her the note . " From his pocket , Victor produced a piece of paper , presumably the same one he had shown the receptionist . He passed it to Elmer , who put on his reading glasses and cleared his throat . He read aloud : Dear Miss Norma : This child is named Victor . He is from Village 1797 in the eastern jungle . We , the residents of 1797 , have pooled our monies together and sent him to the city . We want a better life for Victor . There is no future for him here . Please help us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these individuals will be able to care for the boy . We listen to Lost City Radio every week . We love your show . Your biggest fans , Village 1797 " Norma , " Elmer said , " I 'm sorry . We wanted to tell you ourselves . He 'd be great for the show , but we wanted to warn you first . " " I 'm fine . " She rubbed her eyes and took a deep breath . " I 'm fine . " Norma hated the numbers . Before , every town had a name ; an unwieldy , millenarian name inherited from God-knows-which extinct people , names with hard consonants that sounded like stone grinding against stone . But everything was being modernized , even the recondite corners of the nation . This was all postconflict , a new government policy . They said people were forgetting the old systems . Norma wondered . " Do you know what they used to call your village ? " she asked the boy . Victor shook his head . Norma closed her eyes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the war ended , the government confiscated the old maps . They were taken off the shelves at the National Library , turned in by private citizens , cut out of school textbooks , and burned . Norma had covered it for the radio , had mingled with the excited crowd that gathered at Newtown Plaza to watch . Once , Victor 's village had a name , but it was lost now . Her husband , Rey , had vanished near there , just before the Illegitimate Legion was defeated . This was at the end of the insurrection , ten years before . She was still waiting for him . " Are you all right , Miss Norma ? " the boy asked in a small , reedy voice . She opened her eyes . " What a polite young man , " Len said . He leaned forward , rested his elbows on the table , and patted the boy on his bald head . Norma waited for a moment , counting to ten . She picked up the paper and read it again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town council gathering to decide whose penmanship was best . How folkloric . On the back was a list of names . " Our Missing , " it said , the end of the g curling upward in an optimistic flourish . She could n't bear to read them . Each was a cipher , soulless , faceless , sometime humans , a harvest of names to be read on the air . She passed the note back to Elmer . The idea of it made her inexplicably sleepy .
