" But , to avoid too much homogeneity , we deliberately sifted our candidate pool for potential Marsnauts who would represent America as a nation . " <p> Gates went on to deny accusations made by NASA and the Cato Institute that Gates Aerospace was more interested in a photogenic crew than a competent one . " Well , that 's absurd . I can only guess that this kind of mud-slinging is a result of sour grapes on NASA 's part .

This was n't a standard astronaut reaction , and she had done her best to conceal it from the years-long gauntlet of clipboards and lab coats she 'd had to run to get here . <p> Some interplanetary sex symbol , she kidded herself . Running to the John every hour . But she was due to make the crew 's daily media dispatch today , and she did n't want to be drumming her feet on the deck in front of the time-delayed pupils of Earth . The PR hacks at Gates had told her that her dispatches drew ratings fifty percent better than any other crew member 's , and even though she knew this was just a temporary skewing of the audience composition toward young , male , and horny , she had come to feel an odd sort of duty to live up to the standard that had been set for her . So she washed her hair when it was her day to dispatch , and touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidded her about it , but they knew the score , and Jami thought they were a little grateful that she was taking the pressure off them . <p> Said gratitude did not prevent them from nicknaming her Barbarella , though . <p> All in a day 's work , when the day was spent working for the largest private space venture in the history of humankind . They were seventy-five million kilometers from Earth , and the time delay was now almost four minutes each way . The lag hung between Argos I and Earth as much as the distance itself . Every time they spoke to friends or family or ( more often ) media , it felt more and more like they were speaking to the silence and less like any real human beings existed on the other side of the commlink . <p> She had written those words down in a leather-bound journal she was keeping : speaking to the silence . It had been hard not to write them again . And again . <p> Barbarella is not coping , she said to herself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like interplanetary space ? <p> Jami Salter : Well , I have n't been outside in it , so all I can tell you is that it looks pretty much like space looks like from the Moon . ( laughs ) <p> EF : How big is Earth from where you are now ? <p> JS : Tiny . About one-fiftieth the apparent size of the Moon from Earth , and shrinking all the time . And we 're starting to be able to resolve Mars as a disk . <p> EF : Is the crew having any problems ? <p> JS : It 's surprising how little friction there has been . We 're all getting along great . After all , it does n't do any good to get angry out here ; it 's not like you can take a walk to cool off . All of us are very careful to talk out differences , make sure we know where the points of disagreement are and what can be done to resolve problems . <p> EF : One last question . How do you manage to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty salon ? <p> JS : Ca n't answer that one , Ebony . Us astro-girls have to have some secrets . <p> " How do I manage to look so great ? " she asked Edgar and Katherine , who as usual were sitting just out of camera range commenting on the interview . They made an interesting pair , Edgar stocky and Mayan-looking next to Katherine , the tallest of the group and rail-thin except for a roundness in her cheeks . Jami kept thinking they looked like cousins , with their epicanthic folds and their identical spiky haircuts . <p> " I say genes . Katherine 's got her money on plastic surgery and good lighting . " Edgar pushed back from the table and jumped toward the stairwell that led up to the crew berths . He loved the low gravity . It brought out the monkey in him . <p> " Good lighting , in this can ? " Jami looked at Katherine and they both laughed . <p> The commlink pinged . " Your adoring public , " Katherine said , and winked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jami tapped the screen to open the link . <p> &lt;a split screen : Jami Salter on one side , Filomena Huxtable on the other .

A studio audience is visible behind Filomeena. &gt; <p> F : So you 're the mission electronics specialist . <p> J : That 's right . <p> F : What does that involve , exactly ? <p> &lt;animated schematics of various missions systems pop up as Jami speaks&gt; <p> J : Well , the success of our mission depends on our ability to communicate with each other and with Gates mission control back in Houston .

But there it was , and he was n't about to take a knife to his face or stop working out just so people would stop taking his picture . <p> Especially not now , when in less than six hours he and Jami would be the first human beings to set foot on Mars . They 'd drawn straws , and when he and Jami had won . the reaction from the PR folks at Gates had been decidedly mixed . A photogenic first step was good , but a multiculturally photogenic first step was better . Would the crew reconsider , in light of their standardbearing situation , representing all nations and races , et cetera ? <p> All of them remembered the lesson of Apollo 11 : everybody remembers Armstrong . All of them wanted to be first onto the ground . <p> When the answer came back to Gates , it was negative . Fair was fair . <p> From David Fontenot 's testimony before the Bexar County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us felt that the farther we got from Earth , the farther we got from any kind of connection with human civilization . Not that we were turning into barbarians or resorting to cannibalism ; just that everything on Earth had stopped applying about the time we cleared the orbit of the Moon . The word alone does n't even begin to describe it . <p> I read once the diary of a sailor who was marooned in the eighteenth century for killing one of his shipmates . He records his slow starvation , his efforts to find food and ration water . And he spends a lot of time thinking about his sins . The more he gets resigned to the fact that he 's going to die , the more he starts trying to come to terms with what he 's done wrong . He never admits that he was wrong for killing his shipmate , but he does think about all kinds of other things that he should repent . <p> I forget his name , but his diary was found next to his skeleton a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the time we spent on Mars , I think felt like we were writing a diary like that in our heads . <p> The odd thing was that nothing had gone catastrophically wrong . Every detail of the mission had come off more or less as planned , from separation from the International Space Station right on up to injection into Mars orbit and the exhilarating , exalted space of time when they had fallen out of the sky to a planet no human had ever touched . The ERV was where it was supposed to be , the power plant was churning out water and oxygen , the rocks cried out to be chipped and sampled and mined for new discoveries . Plants were already growing in the greenhouse next to the main station building . No group of explorers had ever been so well prepared . <p> So why , wondered Katherine , were they all so damned morose ? <p> The commlink pinged . For Jami , most likely . It almost always was . <p> " They were supposed to encrypt us , " she grumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always figured someone would find their way through . " <p> " I mean , we 're on Mars , here . It 's dangerous . Would help if the goddamn commlink did n't ping every two minutes with someone wanting to know Jami 's goddamn cup size . " <p> Katherine sighed . They had all just seen too much of each other during the transit . Gates had done the best it could to give them adequate living space and recreational facilities , but no matter how you sliced it , going to Mars still meant nine months in a tin can with five other people every bit as driven and opinionated and sure of themselves as she was . <p> " You think now that we 're here , everyone will relax a little ? " Edgar stood next to her looking out at the Valles Marineris . They had landed and set up at the head of the great canyon system , where its stupendous channel broadened out of the chaos of the Noctis Labyrinthus . One theory had it that sublimation of liquid water caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satellite observations predicted large amounts of water locked up in the crust . Argos I had come to find it , and to find out if Gates could make money exploiting it . <p> Eight hundred miles to the west-northwest , the giant shield volcanoes reared up : Arsia Mons , Pavonis Mons , Ascraeus Mons. A thousand miles beyond them , Olympus Mons. All of them , even Jami and David , dropped their voices a notch when saying those words : Olympus Mons. As if they all half-believed that the gods really did live there . <p> Which was foolish , of course . None of them were really religious . But Olympus Mons .... <p> " I do n't know , Ed , " Katherine said . " I hope so . I hope everyone straightens out so we can really get some work done . " <p> The strange Martian light caught the planes of Edgar 's face . A mechanical engineer by training , he 'd taken doctoral coursework in geology during preparation for the expedition , intending to use this unprecedented fieldwork as material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy everyone looked to when wrenches needed turning ; when they got back to Earth , he said , he 'd finish his Ph.D . and never touch a tool other than a rock hammer as long as he lived . <p> Argos 's primary geologist was Deborah Green . She and Edgar and Katherine had been assigned a series of expeditions into the canyons to look for water and life . In that order . The Gates people realized the stir that life would make back home , but shareholders cared more about the commercial potential of water . In the words of Roland Threlkeld , Gates mission liaison : " Look for water . If you find life , great , but look for water . " <p> Katherine , as the resident life scientist , tried to stifle her aggravation at the skewing of the expedition 's priorities . They had fifteen months on Mars , until October of next year ; plenty of time to indulge some personal hunches without the Gates people having to know and still get back to Earth for the New York Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light did something odd to his face too ; something about the texture of his skin that Katherine could n't identify . He looked out at the landscape of Mars , and she could see the want in his eyes . " When are you going out ? " <p> " Scheduled for tomorrow . " <p> She watched him track the side canyon they would take the next morning down into the head of Valles Marineris . " I know you want to go , Fidelis , " she said . <p> He nodded . " I wanted to go tomorrow . Way things are around here , I 'm in all kinds of a hurry to get out . " <p> This was a lot of emotion , coming from him . Katherine paused . He was the mission physician , but she was an M.D. too , and both of them had undergone training in psychology and psychiatry . " Are you okay ? " <p> Fidelis cocked his head to the side when he looked at her . " None of us are okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window , he headed for the door . " Good luck tomorrow .

The world went white , and Deborah opened her mouth and let the frustration of the past two months chase the joy , the never-to-be-repeated joy of this moment , out of her mouth and through her mask and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deb , Jesus ! " " Deb ! You there ? Come in , Deb ! " <p> " Toggle your cams to me ! " she shouted . " God , look at this ! " <p> She heard their exclamations as they saw through her cam . Water beaded on her mask , held for a moment by her body heat before it sublimated away . Something gripped her hand , and Deborah started before she realized it was Edgar , talking to her on their private channel : " You again , Miz Green . Lucky I have you around . " <p> She squeezed his hand through their bulky gloves , and in that moment a ridiculous thought flashed through her mind : Oh God I 'd better be sure to shower before tonight or we 're going to scrape each other raw . She laughed out loud , and Edgar joined in . Over their mikes they heard the rest of the crew shouting , clapping each other on the back , calling them to come back in and start the celebration .

A character in a book , Jami had said . <p> Katherine had been there inside the airlock door with a puzzled expression on her round face . " Again , " she said . " You , again .

But the look on Katherine 's face was so pained ; she had wanted very badly to discover life on Mars herself , or at least to pronounce life absent , and then her grand moment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Once they 'd found life , found water , basked in their accolades , there was still nearly a year to spend on Mars and seven months of sandpapering each other 's nerves on the voyage home . The Gates scientific crew thought up more than enough experiments and missions to keep them busy , but their real work was done . They had established that Mars held both life and enough water to justify colonization . Already a dozen Mars colonies were moving from pencil-sketch imagining to nuts-and-bolts reality . In ten years , Mars would be utterly changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said David . " Who knows if we 'll get to come back ? " <p> " Would you want to ? " <p> Jami 's question surprised him . They were running the latest in an endless series of inspections of joints , hoses , bearings , and seals - anything that could be eroded by peroxides or clogged by dust . Which was to say , everything . They 'd taken to doing it in pairs , and when it had become apparent that the pairs were rubber-stamping each other ( after Katherine and Fidelis had both missed a badly corroded seal that then blew , freezing the station water supply ) , they 'd taken to sending out pairs who were n't getting along with each other . This meant that Fidelis hardly ever got inspection duty , since everyone liked him . <p> It also meant that David and Jami were at last going to have to get out into the open whatever it was that had been hanging between them since they 'd been anointed Argos I media darlings . Or so , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go , David thought . " Yeah , " he said . " I think I would . " <p> Jami looked at him for a long time . The Sun was setting , the Martian landscape settling from golds and reds back into evening browns . There was enough dust on her faceplate that David could n't see her expression . <p> " I bet you would , " she said eventually . <p> Ebony Freytag 's show became the crew 's guilty pleasure . On a Tuesday in December , they watched as she devoted an entire show to random things her audience wanted to know about the Argos crew . Did they lose a lot of weight in space ? Were they more religious than when they 'd left ? What were they really doing ? <p> And why , someone asked , was everyone so heated up about David Fontenot when Fidelis Emuwa was so gorgeous ? <p> " I guess Fidelis is a pretty good-looking guy , " David said . <p> Katherine snorted . " Why do we watch this garbage ? Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we let them ? " <p> The two of them were sitting in the common room . Fidelis came down from the dorm level . " Are we a sideshow ? " <p> " When was the last time we got a call from someone other than Gates about either exobiology or water ? " <p> David got up for a cup of tea . He wanted to stay to the side of this discussion . After his exchange with Jami a few days before , he 'd tried to be more sensitive to the mood of the crew , and what he 'd seen thus far was n't encouraging . Holiday blues , he thought ; all of us get a little crabby around the New Year . He hoped that was all it was . <p> Deborah came in from the direction of the lab . " Another day , another goddamn revolutionary discovery about Martian geological history . I 'm sick of it . " <p> " Maybe we should take a couple of days off , " David said , and then wished he had n't spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkering with something , cleaning out a ball joint somewhere or changing the rover 's battery terminals . Jami , who knew , Jami was doing her Martian Bedouin-mystic thing somewhere nearby . She had enough to do keeping station computer equipment up and communicative , but recently she 'd developed a tendency to wander off once things had reached a bare minimum functionality . Katherine and Deborah were getting sharp about it . <p> HotVegas , February 11 , 2011 : <p> Odds that one or more Argos crewmembers has attempted suicide : 4 to 1 <p> Odds that one or more Argos crewmembers will attempt suicide : 2 to 3 <p> Odds that all six Argos crewmembers survive the mission : 6 to 1 <p> David gathered the Argos crew in the station greenhouse . All of them liked it there . It was warm , it smelled good , it was n't brown . " I think we ought to have a chat . All of us . " <p> Everyone settled into a rough circle . David looked around the group , saw that Deborah was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So they had n't arranged themselves according to cliques . That was good . " Katherine , " he said , " I know this is more your territory - " <p> " Fidelis is more of a psych guy than I am , " she said . " I was a surgeon . " <p> He let the interruption pass , then plunged ahead . " I 'm concerned about our collective well-being here . " <p> The wind kicked up , rattling dust and gravel against the greenhouse walls . <p> " So am I , " said Fidelis . David was looking at him just before he spoke , and he saw Fidelis look quickly at Jami and then away . Worried about Jami ? he wondered . Or is Fidelis worried about himself , and Jami 's the reason ? <p> " I think we 're all worried , " Katherine said . " We 're on another planet , halfway through a three-year mission . It 's lethal and ugly outside , and we 're all sick of looking at each other , so inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission prep . We knew it would happen . " <p> Edgar cut in . " That 's not the same as dealing with it when it does . " <p> " But anticipating the problem at least gives us a basis for dealing with it , " Fidelis said calmly . <p> " So let 's deal , " David said . " What do we need ? I 'll start . I need to play some euchre . " <p> " What 's euchre ? " everyone else said more or less at once . <p> " Card game . It 's simple . I used to play with my dad and my uncles up in Petoskey . I 've been playing on the computer , but it 's not the same . I miss it . " He looked to his right , where Deborah was picking dead leaves from a grapevine . She kept picking , but he could see her thinking . <p> " I need Edgar to leave me alone for a while , " she said . <p> From the Washington Post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARS <p> by Allen Holley <p> During the six weeks before Argos I left the International Space Station , the bandwidth of the developed world crackled with nothing but Marsnauts . During their voyage to the Red Planet , we worried how they would get along , if they would fall in love ; we bet on the possibility of their failure ; we spent our free time pouring information about Jami , David , Deborah , Edgar , Katherine , and Fidelis into our heads . <p> I thought it would peter out before they got there . Interest would spike again once they landed , of course , but apart from that and another flurry of information if they discovered something exciting - little green men or underground rivers or veins of iridium - but beyond that , I figured that the obsessive persistence of American consumerate was of fairly short duration . <p> I was wrong . <p> We have been gaga over the Marsnauts for much longer than I ever would have guessed . Chatthreads devoted to Deborah Green 's sexual orientation unspooled posts in the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subject exceeded the number of eyeballs trained on last summer 's World Cup in South Africa ; applications to Argos Marsnauts ' alma maters are up more than one hundred percent since the selection of the crew . <p> So yes , I was wrong . <p> I can admit this because we are , at last , beginning to forget . Bandwidth consumption at all the newsnets is down , or at least redirected to the pipes carrying the Chinese incursion into India ; Ebony Freytag is stinging from the lawsuit ; the various chat forums , if not exactly quiet , are no longer as riotous as they were in the halcyon early days of Mars-mania . This despite the fact that the crew of Argos I has in fact discovered extraterrestrial life , throwing biology ( and religion ) on its collective ear , and begun to map huge quantities of water under the planet 's surface , meaning that colonization has abruptly become a question not of if but of when . <p> They have been amazingly successful . And we are starting to ignore them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a relief . <p> " Deborah , " Edgar said . She snapped a tendril from the vine . <p> " David asked what we need . I 'm telling you . I tried to think of something else , but that 's it . I need you to leave me alone for a while . " <p> Edgar stood very still for several seconds before picking up his tool belt . <p> " Edgar , " David said before Edgar could leave . " Please stay . " <p> After a pause , Edgar put the tool belt back on the work table in the center of the greenhouse . " Thank you , " David said , trying to keep the real gratitude out of his voice . Things were getting very deep very fast , and he had to make sure the gathering did n't fly apart . " Katherine ? " <p> " I would like you to ask Gates to give us more leeway in running experiments . The schedule is still predicated on searching for life that we 've already found , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gates labs have already arranged to publish the results . " <p> David nodded . " Okay . Let 's do it this way : you start reporting to me , and I 'll send abstracts of your results to Gates . I 'll take the heat . " <p> " Thank you , " Katherine said . " Also I would like to learn how to play euchre . " She smiled at him , and in that moment he could have kissed her . Whatever she said about Fidelis being the psych guy , Katherine knew the thin line David was treading , and she was doing her best to help . <p> " That 's two things , " he said , " but we are a resilient enough crew to handle them both , I think . Jami . " <p> " I need everyone to stop looking at me like I 'm going crazy . " <p> There was a long pause . <p> " And I need people to please stop getting so quiet when I talk , " Jami added . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a sixth-grader at Fred P. Hall Elementary School in Portland , Maine . I want to go to Mars some day . Can you tell me what college I should go to ? I want to be a pilot and make sure aliens do n't take over Mars or come to Earth . Will they let me do that even though I still have to wear glasses because my mom wo n't pay to burn my corneas ? <p> Sincerely , <p> Megan Machado <p> " Noted , " David said . " We got it . You are n't crazy , and we 'll start interrupting you . Fidelis ? " <p> " We 're all too alone , " Fidelis said . " I need everyone to start talking to each other again ... no . I need everyone to start listening to each other again . " <p> Leave it to Fidelis to be level-headed and precise , David thought . Carrying around his own self-assurance , a banked coal hidden from the winds that tore through the rest of them . <p> Or he was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the dark . <p> " You heard the doc , " David said . " Everybody start listening . We 're all talking - hell , I talk all the time - but we 're talking to ourselves . " Greenhouse spring , he found himself thinking . A little island in the midst of so much cold and dark . A little spring , like the one they were all missing on Earth . " I think we need to get control of this , " he went on . " As of tomorrow , we resume burst transmissions back to Earth . No more recording and storing ; we send everything live . " <p> " Gates wo n't run it , " Deborah said . <p> " I do n't care if Gates runs it or not . We all need to know that someone knows we 're out here . When we just record and store for the backup pipe , we 're talking to ourselves . Starting tomorrow , we talk to Earth again . " <p> " And I guess we 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jami said . Her voice was barely above a whisper . <p> " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " snapped Katherine , " you 're the last person around here who should worry about that . " <p> Jami was nodding before Katherine finished her sentence . " Right , you 're right . It really helps knowing that they all care so much about me . How can I be lonely knowing that so many people care ? " Her voice throughout was soft , and when she finished speaking she got up and pushed through the door that led back to Bohlen Station . <p> David watched her go . When the door had settled shut behind her , he surveyed the four people left in front of him . <p> Only Deborah was looking back at him . " She 's cracking up , David . You need to do something . She named the station after a schizophrenic mechanic in an old science-fiction novel , for Christ 's sake . Does n't that worry you ? " <p> " Katherine ? " David said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . David could n't tell if some kind of secret physician 's exchange was passing between them . After a moment , both shrugged . " She 's been under a lot of pressure from the beginning , " Fidelis said . " It 's a good sign that she 's still performing all of her work . " <p> " But barely , " Katherine interjected . <p> " That 's true of all of us , " said Fidelis . " None of us is working anything like we did our first few months here . " <p> David stepped back in . " If Jami , or anyone else , starts leaving critical work unfinished , someone tell me right away . I 'll keep an eye out , but the water separator 's a full-time job lately . I need people looking out for each other . None of us can afford to crack . Stay together , people . " <p> It was the moment to end the gathering , mission mostly accomplished , crew refocused and given a little momentum to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Edgar what he wanted . <p> Edgar Villareal , interview with Bruce Pandolfo of 700MHz , June 9 , 2065 : <p> It 's odd to be the last one alive . When we went to Mars , I think we all figured we were immortal . Along the way we figured out that we were n't , and realized how awful it would be if we were . Jami could n't handle it . David could , he was always better at that kind of thing . I know I was glad to have both of them sopping up most of the attention before it got to me . Remember , I was only 3-1 to be the murdered crew member . Jami , Fidelis , and Deborah were all way ahead of me . People paid more attention to them . And David . <p> Anyway , I figured half of us would live to be a hundred . Now here I am , ninety next weekend , and I 'm the last . And it 's sad that three of us ... Fidelis 's accident was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah . <p> For three days the wind did not blow . Sand and dust settled in gentle drifts around the camp . Fidelis spent each of those three days immersed in his work , keeping himself away from the windows . He wanted to go outside , but he did n't want to see what he knew would be there . <p> Blow , wind , he said to himself , and felt creeping unease . Madmen on a dead red heath , that was all of them . Blow , wind . He steeled himself to resist Mars . If the wind would not blow , neither would Fidelis Emuwa go outside . He could outwait seeing agency in randomness . That 's what they call paranoia . <p> Finally he could n't stand it any more . He suited up and went outside into the absurd stillness . The sky was bright and clear . His footsteps crunched as he walked around to the back of the greenhouse , where he 'd seen Jami writing in the sand three days before , after David 's meeting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Between his feet , the words : speaking to the silence . <p> Fidelis knelt and brushed them away . <p> The first day nobody called was hard on all of them . Except Jami . " Twenty-four hours and no ping , " she announced with a broad smile . " It only took a year and a half . Longer attention span than we thought they had , I bet . " <p> " By about a year , " grumbled Katherine , who Edgar figured was grouchy because Gates had n't gotten back to her about her proposal to go into the lava tunnels looking for life other than the scrawny lichen that survived in cracks in canyon walls . He wanted to do it too , but until today he had n't figured Gates would let them . Too much to lose . Now that the dataflow from Earth had slowed to a trickle , though , he thought Gates might change its mind . They 'd be looking for something to rejuvenate news coverage . Katherine wanted to go , but she also welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned , anything that got him out of Bohlen Station and away from Deborah ( for weeks now he 'd been thinking of her as that bitch Deborah , but he was beginning to get over that ) more than justified whatever risks arose . And away from Jami , who had suddenly begun to act like she was on the vid all the time . Of course , all of them were on the vid all the time ; they 'd agreed to sell " uncut " VR of the voyage as part of their contract with Gates . The feeling Edgar got , though , was that she had started playing a part . She was playing Barbarella the Mission Babe again , only now it was for her colleagues instead of Earthside media . <p> He wondered if she 'd forgotten how to be herself . If somehow the intensity of the news coverage had overwhelmed whatever natural person had existed before they 'd all become Marsnauts . Edgar thought back to training and their early publicity junkets . He 'd liked Jami . She 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without seeming to make a point of it . The cameras found her , and the rest of them were grateful , even Edgar , who had once wanted to be an actor . He quickly found that they needed Jami to take the pressure off them . They would all have imploded long ago if she had n't done that . <p> " Now we can go back to being the anonymous discoverers of life beyond Earth , " he said . <p> Jami flashed him a grin . " Thank God . You doing anything today ? " <p> " Not unless Katherine gets the go-ahead to check out the tunnels . " <p> " Then come with me . Reactor sensors are due for inspection . " <p> " Let 's do it . " Anything to get out of here , Edgar thought again . <p> The Quiet Day , as it became known around the station , turned out to be an anomaly . Apparently people on Earth were still interested . But where before they 'd struggled to answer the flood of scientific and media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume was kids looking for help on science projects and lonely postgrads wishing they were on Mars instead of in Ann Arbor or Heidelberg or Jakarta . " It 's official , " Deborah said . " We 're a niche . " <p> On Jami 's birthday , August 22nd , she took off on a long solo hike . David almost did n't let her , but there was only so much he could do , and he settled for making sure that she had twenty-four hours of oxygen and a tested distress beacon . She 's an adult , he said , and if she 's going to kill herself I ca n't do much about it . <p> The more he watched her , the more convinced he was that she would be better once they 'd all gotten on their way home . Surrounded by the empty red immensity of Mars , David thought , memories of Earth started to get a little abstract , like something he 'd done once and might someday do again . <p> Deborah , Katherine , and Edgar were shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final check on Jami 's suit . He got in among the four of them and calmed things down enough to get a sense of what was going on . It was cold in the station , something wrong with the thermostat , and he could see his breath . <p> " She 's up to something , " Edgar said . " And he knows what it is . " <p> " Up to what ? " David asked . He caught Fidelis 's eye and tried out his telepathy : Is Edgar okay ? Do we have a problem here ? <p> Fidelis looked away from him and said , " She 's having a hard time . This is true . And we have talked about it . She 's entitled to some privacy , though , and I 'm not going to just repeat what was said for all of you . " <p> " If she 's cracking up , it endangers the mission , Fidelis , " Deborah said . Edgar was nodding along with her . " I could give a shit about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skating on the edge of pathological for months , Fidelis , " Katherine said . " If she 's fallen over , you 're the one who will know , and you ca n't keep it from us . " Edgar and Deborah started to join in . <p> " Let me be clear about something , " Fidelis snapped . The rest of them fell silent ; they 'd never heard him raise his voice except to laugh . " If I thought Jami was putting the mission in danger , I would of course tell David . I would not just tell whoever wanted to know , and I will not be bullied because you are all anxious . Do not insult me by turning me into a snitch , and do not insult me by suggesting I will not carry out my responsibilities . " He glared at each of them in turn . When nobody said anything , he walked between Katherine and Edgar and went upstairs . <p> " He 's not telling us everything he knows , " Deborah said . <p> David waited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a pause , he said , " He does n't have to . You heard what he said . Do any of us really think that Fidelis Emuwa , of all people , is going to let personal feelings get in the way of his job ? Come on . " <p> Again he waited , and again none of them contradicted him , but David could tell they were n't convinced . <p> Gates Corporation communications records , August 22nd , 2011 Subpoenaed as evidence in the trial of Fidelis Liber Emuwa , David Louis Fontenot , Deborah Ruth Green , Edgar Carlos Villareal , and Katherine Alexandra Yi <p> Date : 22 Aug 2011 , 14:35:06 GMT <p> To : Argos PM Roland Threlkeld <p> From : Tammy Gulyas , Argos Mission Liaison <p> Re : Argos trouble ? <p> Rol , <p> David was in touch today .

Sit tight . David 's strung out like the rest of them . Jami 's going to be fine , so is Edgar . Fidelis is a rock . R <p> They all took Labor Day off . It was a gesture , really , since they could take all the days off they wanted . Their scientific objectives were long ago accomplished , and with the launch back to Earth less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel and exploration . So they played lots of euchre and went over preliminary checks and tried not to get on each other 's nerves . <p> Fidelis spent the morning in the common room reading Don Quixote on the table screen . He had been keeping a careful eye on Jami for weeks now , since he 'd seen her writing in the sand . She was holding herself together , but he could tell it would n't take much to unravel her . Everyone else in the crew had come to him wondering about her bright brittle smile , the metronomic way she did her work , ate her meals , slept and bathed and spoke . David in particular was worried , and seemed to be carrying some kind of guilt . " First I thought that when the attention went away , she 'd settle down . And she did , kind of , but it was n't real . Then I started to figure that as launch got closer and the nets started talking about engineering obstacles , she 'd perk back up because they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her area of expertise . Things that make her sound good . " <p> David scratched at his ear , something he did when he was n't sure how to proceed . <p> " Then this goddamn latest Ebony Freytag , " he said after a pause . " Getting my idiot cousin and Jami 's twenty-year-old sister together . I can shake my head and forget about that kind of shit , you know ? But I think that was some kind of last straw for her . The way she walks around now I keep thinking she 's just going to fly apart . Like every wrinkle in her skin is a crack . " <p> " We 're still getting lots of questions , " Fidelis pointed out . <p> " I know , " David said . Edgar came in , and he lowered his voice . " But they 're from twelve-year-olds and nutcases . It does n't mean anything to her . " <p> " Where 's Deborah ? " Edgar said . He had shaved his beard . <p> Fidelis looked at David . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Maybe she 's in the lab . " Edgar turned to go . <p> " Edgar , " Fidelis called . " Are you all right ? " <p> " Fine fine fine , Doc , " Edgar said . " Just time to talk , is all . She wanted me to leave her alone , I left her alone . Now she 's got to do something for me , and that 's tell me what the hell is going on . Do n't worry , I 'm not mad , and she could kick my ass anyway , I think . " It was probably true ; Edgar and Deborah were about the same size , but when it came right down to it , she had a mean streak and he did n't . <p> Edgar was n't the one Fidelis was worried about , anyway . " You know I have to ask , " he said . Edgar waved a hand and left in the direction of the lab . <p> " You really think there 's no problem ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back in bed , but I do n't expect any real trouble , either . They were always together more out of some kind of rock-hound solidarity than because they liked each other . " <p> David was looking at the doorway . " I wondered about that . " <p> Jami walked in . " Fidelis ! " she said with that bright and hopeless smile . " Just the man I wanted to see . Let 's go for a hike . " <p> From : Blaine Taggart <p> To : Argos I crew <p> Subject : 15 minutes <p> Dear Marsnauts : How does it feel to know that your moment in the spotlight has already passed you by ? My dad was a comedian , had three minutes on Johnny Carson one night in 1981 , and never got over it . Just curious . By the way , I hear the fungus in your Mars lichen has a common ancestor with some terrestrial fungus . So three cheers for panspermia , right ? <p> " I 'm not going back . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had lost much sleep over the previous six or seven nights rehearsing possible responses . None of them seemed appropriate now . What could he tell her ? That she would die ? Of course she would die . That her family would miss her ? She knew that . That she was going to be rich and famous , feted in castles and capitals ? <p> " Jami , " he said . " Do you know what will happen to us if you do n't comeback ? " <p> She glanced at him . " No . Come on , Fidelis . Appeal to my sense of responsibility to science , my desire for fame . Something . Just do n't make me worry about you anymore . " <p> " I do n't think you have those things anymore . Once you did . All of this has fallen away from you . " <p> Jami laughed . A little static sparked in Fidelis 's mike . " Was n't nirvana supposed to be the relinquishing of all desire ? I forget . Ca n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidelis : you do n't want me with you on the way back . " She started walking away from him , gliding easily between boulders in the direction of the trail that led to the bottom of the canyon . " And I do n't mean that personally , like people on the mission would rather see me stay . What I mean is , if you make me come with you , none of us will survive the trip home .

" she said . <p> Jami did n't look up . " I think I 've had it with being a spectacle . " <p> " Well , I have n't had it with fulfilling our contract . Stop that . " <p> " Okay . " Jami put down the small hammer and chisel she 'd been using . " All done anyway . " <p> Katherine punched the wall intercom mounted next to the interior airlock door . " David , " she said . " Come here , please . " <p> His voice popped through the speaker . " Problem ? " <p> Katherine stabbed the button again . " Just come here , please . " <p> Jami mounted the plate over the corder and started screwing it back into place . " Do n't , " Katherine said . <p> " Cleaning up , Katherine , " Jami said . " Not hiding . " But she put the plate back down . <p> David arrived . " What ? " <p> Katherine was about to speak when Fidelis came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of them and the eight suits hanging on wall racks . " I did n't ask him to come , " Katherine said , pointing at Fidelis . <p> " Is this a private dispute ? " David asked . <p> Briefly Katherine considered pushing the point . She and David both knew that Fidelis would defend whatever Jami was doing . To a certain extent that canceled out the benefit of the defense . " Never mind , " she said . " I walked in here and Jami was sabotaging the recording equipment in her suit . " <p> " Jami ? " David asked . <p> " Guilty , " she said immediately . With the toe of one shoe she scuffed at the bits of broken circuitry on the floor . <p> David sighed . " All right . Look . Jami - " <p> " How much money did she just cost us ? " Katherine asked . She could already see David preparing to go easy on Jami . Well and good for him . He was one of the stars of the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and nobody would be clamoring for her memoirs or her face on their screens . She 'd have a good job when she got back , but she 'd had a good job before leaving . The only reason she 'd wanted to go to Mars in the first place was to cash in on whatever fame might come her way . The science she could have done at home , and Mars itself was so much empty , rock-strewn wilderness . She would n't miss it . <p> " I do n't know , " David said . After a pause he added , " Station vids are still going . Gates can piece something together . Unless - " <p> " Speaking of which , " Jami said . She stood up and went to the intercom . " Everyone please come to the lock , " she said . " No hurry . " Then she woke up the terminal next to the intercom . <p> " What are you doing ? " Katherine said . <p> " Shutting down the autofeed from the station vid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a hand . <p> " It 's okay , " he said . " Everything will still record . We can pipe it later . " <p> The four of them stood there looking at each other until Edgar and Deborah arrived . They had obviously been making love , the smell of it preceded them into the lock , and Katherine thought to herself , Jesus Christ . <p> " Okay , " Jami said . " First I want to apologize . I have n't done anything to station recorders or the suit recorders except for mine . Gates will be pissed , but to be frank , what I 'm about to do is worth a lot more money than what otherwise would have been on my corder . " <p> " Jami , " Fidelis said quietly . <p> " Shut up , Fidelis , " Katherine said . " Let her take her own weight for once . " <p> A ghost of a smile crossed Jami 's face . " Thank you , Katherine . The short version is this : I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something about it made Katherine a little sick . " There . You 're all rich . " <p> " You 're not staying here , " David said . <p> " You ca n't make me go back . You could jump me and tie me down , but if you do that I 'll kill myself . Can you keep me too doped up to do it for the next seven months ? " She shook her head . " I do n't think so . Katherine ? You 're the doctor . Fidelis ? What kind of star material will I be after seven months of minimal-g drooling into my collar ? " <p> The only sound in the room was the rattle of a loose valve cover on the outside of the lock . After some time , Fidelis spoke . <p> " I think Katherine will agree with me that there would be serious long-term consequences . " <p> " There will be serious long-term consequences if she stays here , " Katherine answered . " Since we 're all being honest here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we 've all catered to Miss Jami Salter , but I do n't want to see her dead . If she stays here , she 'll die . " <p> " I do n't know about that , " Edgar said . Deborah looked startled . <p> Jami was nodding . " The station is staying behind . The greenhouse will be here . The reactor will still be working long after all of us are dead . What else do I need ? " <p> " This is ridiculous , " Katherine said . <p> " I 'm not going back to Earth , " Jami said .

Six at the most . She 'll be fine until then . " <p> " Fine ? " Katherine said incredulously . " Fine ? " <p> They all heard the inner airlock start to compress . Nothing was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jami said . She was spending more and more time outside now , and since she 'd wrecked her VR corder her mood had grown lighter . Some of the old genuine Jami Salter effervescence had returned , although tinctured by a sort of maturity that made Fidelis think of the stately poets he 'd read in college English classes . Wordsworth , maybe . <p> He turned off his VR and lay back . Earth was one hundred days away , and Jami Salter was beyond human help . <p> During their last day on Mars , Fidelis had personally recorded everything after the meeting . He had been unable to take his eyes from her face , from the somehow beatific gaze she cast on him , on the rest of the crew , on the Martian landscape . He watched her as she helped them run the flight checks on the orbiter , as she brought the ERV back up from its hibernation , as she ran Edgar through all of the things she worried he might have forgotten . All of them had drilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was really afraid of what Jami 's absence would mean for mission success . She had repaired and jerry-rigged electronics , yes , and piloted when shift scheduling called for it , and it was certainly possible that something would go wrong on the return voyage that only she would be able to correct . That worry was distant somehow , like the abstract concern of being holed by a meteor . Nothing that could usefully be worried about . <p> It hit him then : Jami , who had been their movie star , was now their guide . She would make sure they got home . <p> Fidelis had not cried since the birth of his daughter Emily . He found tears again on that last day he spent on the surface of Mars , and now on every day since when he gave himself over to the enormity of what they had done in leaving her behind . <p> From Fidelis Emuwa 's personal multimedia record , October 17 , 2011 Submitted as evidence in Bexar County Court , September 14 , 2012 <p> Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on . Tomorrow Argos I lifts off , returns to Earth , and everyone on it commits to being forgotten . And I 'm not such a drama queen that that 's the most important thing . We commit to forgetting too , or to becoming the kind of person who does nothing but remember . That 's the hell we 've made for ourselves , Fidelis . For the rest of our lives , we 'll either be answering questions about this mission or wishing people would ask . When they stop asking , we 'll get louder , and then what happens ? <p> No . Not me . Barbarella has left the building , Fidelis . I 'm just Jami , and I 'm just staying here . Nothing for me to go back to . <p> They made the ERV rendezvous without a hitch , and had already done the first acceleration burn when the commlink pinged with the Gates security code . <p> " What in the living fuck did you just do ? " screamed Roland Threlkeld when David opened the connection . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over while the rendezvous vehicle was incommunicado , and then while the ERV came out of Mars 's communication shadow . It was a wonder he had n't stroked out . <p> Are you laughing ? he asked himself . You left a crewmember behind on Mars . How can you laugh ? . <p> The smile would n't go away . <p> Another burst from Roland : " Are you out of your fucking mind ! ? Jesus Christ on a goddamn Popsicle stick , you fucking left Jami fucking Salter on fucking Mars ! ! ? " <p> The connection went dead . <p> " What are you going to tell him ?

Eventually , when they had the ERV moving like it was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone together . " Now we 've done it , " he said . " So we have to defend it . We ca n't lie , and we ca n't just say that we did what Jami wanted . We have to convince people that it was the only thing we could do . So . I 'm listening . " <p> " We 're all going to go to jail , " Katherine said . <p> " I do n't think so , " countered Edgar . " If we argue that she was a danger to the mission , then all we were doing was saving ourselves . " <p> " Do you believe that ? " Fidelis asked . <p> Edgar lifted his chin . " Yes , I do . " <p> " I think we endangered the mission by leaving her , " Katherine said . " And not just our mission ; have any of you thought about what this is going to do to the possibility of other Mars missions ? What kind of harm have we done here ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than us ; people latched onto our faces , but the guys who put up the money are figuring that the consumerate will do the same for any group of Marsnauts .

" That 'll be Roland again , " said Fidelis . <p> " Guess I should start putting together some kind of response . Unless one of you wants to do it ? " They all just looked at him . Deborah and Fidelis at least had the grace to grin . " I did n't think so . " <p> Roland Threlkeld 's message started to unspool . All of them started to laugh . Even Edgar , who hated profanity , could n't help but chuckle . <p> " One thing more , " David said . " And this is not funny .

We stand by it . " <p> Article from the Houston Chronicle , August 18 , 2012 : <p> CHARGES AGAINST ARGOS I CREW DISMISSED <p> Bexar County District Judge Fulgencio Salazar has thrown out charges against David Fontenot in the marooning of Jami Salter on Mars . <p> Citing the prosecution 's inability to produce any evidence either that Salter would in fact be harmed by remaining on Mars or that the crew had conspired against Salter 's well-being , Judge Salazar dismissed felony charges against Fontenot and left little doubt that conspiracy and accessory charges against Fidelis Emuwa , Deborah Green , Edgar Villareal , and Katherine Yi would be dismissed as well . <p> " I have as yet seen no persuasive evidence that a crime was committed by any of those charged , " Judge Salazar said in the courtroom this morning , as Salter family members sat shocked and relatives and supporters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom , Salter family attorney Michelle Braunschweig said that the family would consider its options . Attorneys for Emuwa , Green , Villareal , and Yi refused comment . David Fontenot 's attorney Britt Kirschner told reporters that he considered his client 's actions completely vindicated . " No one who was not on Mars with David Fontenot and the crew of Argos I should be sitting in judgment of what they did there . None of us has ever experienced anything like what they have . I have total confidence that David acted in the crew 's best interests , the mission 's best interests , and Jami Salter 's best interests . " <p> Kirschner , as he has done throughout the case , laid the blame for the situation on the voracious celebrity culture fostered by the commercial newsnets . " It is my fervent hope , and David 's , " he said , " that future Mars crews and colonists will not be turned into grist for the celebrity mill . " <p> Planned future Mars missions at this time include hydrological surveys sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these missions has been asked to determine the whereabouts and health of Jami Salter . A planned **29;1186;TOOLONG mission financed by Gates appears to be on hold for now . <p> Eileen Aufdemberge looked at her sister Deb . Looked hard . They had n't seen much of each other since Deb had returned from Mars , and today , out in the back yard where three years ago she 'd tried to see Argos I when it was on the other side of the world , Eileen wanted to try to get to know her sister again . <p> Jared came out of the house . He 'd slouched his way into adolescence since the last time Deb had visited . The ten-year-old who knew everything about his Aunt Deb had given way to a thirteen-year-old who pretended not to care . Now he walked up to Deb and presented her with a bottle . MARTIAN HAIR , it said . <p> " They say it 's got Martian chemicals in it , that it 'll bleach your hair but not dry it out . Girls at school ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious ? " Deb said . Eileen watched her turn the bottle and read its ingredients . She handed it back to Jared . " Tell them that peroxides are peroxides . If this stuff bleaches without drying , it 's got nothing to do with Mars . " <p> " Thanks , Aunt Deb , " Jared said . He flipped the bottle up in the air and caught it behind his back . " You just made me ten bucks . " <p> The screen door slid shut behind him . Eileen sat on the deck behind the house outside Knoxville she 'd bought with Derek and kept when Derek left her for the woman who sold him his new car . She 'd kept Jared too , but was happy to see the car go ; it was one of those low-slung ostentatiously sporty models that Deb had always called " penis extenders . " <p> Labor Day was the next Monday , and Deb had taken a long weekend away from her round of conferences and public appearances to lie on the grass in her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost four now , counting all the pre-launch buildup - years . <p> Where to start ? <p> " So tell me all about it , " she said . <p> " All about what ? " Deb said , and they both smiled . Deb laced her fingers behind her head and looked up into the bright blue Tennessee sky . " I 'm not sure I know how to talk about it yet , " she said . <p> " Seems like that 's all you do . " <p> " I 'm not sure I 'm doing it right , though , really getting at it the way it was . " Deb turned her head toward Eileen , who was sitting on the deck stairs with a glass of iced tea . " I wonder if Erik the Red had this problem . <p> " People made bets on whether we 'd survive . People I did n't know got on international media outlets and said they 'd had sex with me . I 'm the first human being to discover life somewhere other than Earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to Jami about it . " <p> " What was that like ? Discovering life , I mean . " Eileen amended herself quickly , not wanting Deb to get into a Jami Salter rant . She still had n't sorted out how she felt about the abandonment of Jami . The crew knew best , she supposed , but her sister had wanted to bring Jami back , and Eileen had always trusted Deb 's judgment . Except once : Deb had n't liked Derek Aufdemberge . <p> " It was , it was , it was , " Deb said , rolling back to look up at the sky , " so mundane . Picking through rocks at the bottom of a giant rockslide , at the bottom of a canyon that makes the Grand Canyon look like a drainage ditch . Turn a rock over , hey look , there 's some lichen . It 's dead , obviously it lived in more protected circumstances , but it 's lichen . You want to know something interesting ? I ca n't tell the story like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embellish , or I 'm afraid they wo n't be interested . I discovered life on Mars , and I 'm afraid people will be bored because I 'm not Jami Salter telling them . Jesus . " <p> Neither of them spoke for a while . Music started up in Jared 's room . <p> " What about Jami , Deb ? " <p> " What about her ? " <p> " You know what I mean . " <p> Another pause . <p> " I have a little secret about that too , " Deb said eventually . " As much as I got sick of everyone loving her and everyone wanting to talk to her and everyone ignoring me because I was n't her , I have to admit that she took the heat for all of us . People wanted a mission babe , and they decided - for obvious reasons - that it was going to be Jami , and she hated it . But she did it . " <p> " Did she want to stay on Mars , do you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't think we should have let her , but , as usual , the men got their way . " <p> This had been pointed out repeatedly in the media , with a variety of spins . Eileen wondered how to pursue it . " Did n't they like her ? Were they afraid of her ? " <p> Deb was shaking her head . " None of that . I think everyone there voted exactly what they thought was best . But still , all the men voted to leave her . " <p> The music in Jared 's room changed to an amped-up version of a song Eileen vaguely remembered from her own adolescence . <p> " It 's still not fair , " Deb said . " It 's still not fair that they recognized her so much more than the rest of us . Sometimes I still think she stayed behind as one last gesture , so she had the last trump card over the rest of us . We 'll never measure up to that . How can we ? " <p> Eileen got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister . " Who wants to measure up ? What 's to measure up to ? You discovered life and water on Mars . She cracked up and could n't go home . You want to measure up to that ? " <p> Deb was shaking her head , but she reached over to clasp Eileen 's hand . " Not that simple . She did n't just crack ; she was broken . I do n't think anybody could have just sailed through what happened to her . " <p> " You just said that you went through the same kind of thing . " <p> " Not the same . " <p> " Yes , it is the same , " Eileen insisted . " People seized on what was obvious about you , and they blew it up into something monstrous . They did the same thing with her . And with the rest of you , except David . " <p> " David does n't make much of an impression , " Deb said . " A good guy , a smart guy , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What ? Oh my God . " <p> " I know . I 'm terrified . " <p> " What are you going to do ? " <p> Deb was shaking her head . Eileen saw how much gray Mars had threaded into her hair . " Pick the petals off a daisy . Get my palm read . Consult a Magic 8-Ball . I do n't know . God , I want to , Eileen . I think about him every second of the day , I want him next to me . If not closer . " She grinned at Eileen . " He sure is fine between the sheets . " <p> Eileen 's first instinct was to say Derek was n't bad either , but she bit it back . This was no time to mention Derek . So instead she said , " Do you think you can get along when you 're not in the sack ? " <p> " That 's the thing , " Deborah said . Now she looked sad and tired . " He voted to leave Jami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Subcommittee on Space and Colonization , September 7 , 2012 : <p> Senator Joshua Lindvahl : Jami Salter had everything to come back for . She was famous , she was going to be rich , she had made a professional name for herself in her field . She was a hero to the people of Minnesota , whom I am privileged to represent , and to the country , and to the world . Why in God 's name , Doctor Emuwa , would she just decide not to come back ? <p> Fidelis Emuwa : Because seventy-three million people placed a bet with HotVegas on whether or not she would be killed in a fit of sexual jealousy . <p> The talk at Boston University had gone well , Fidelis thought , and it was good to be back in Massachusetts . He 'd spoken all over the country , and in Switzerland and Italy and Japan , about the psychological stresses of deep-space missions . Everywhere people responded to his low-key authority , and in optimistic moments he felt that he might be doing his small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no avoiding commercial sponsorship of space exploration ; given that , he felt it critical that the astronauts were protected better than the Argos I crew had been . He had his critics , but with Katherine saying much the same thing - in her more confrontational way - Fidelis was guardedly sure that future crews would not be quite the commodities that he and Jami and the rest of them had become . <p> He was standing in front of the business school watching the traffic on Commonwealth Avenue . Earth gravity still felt heavy in the muscles of his thighs . Maybe he would walk down Comm Ave. , pick up a book and a burrito in Kenmore Square , walk the bridge over the Mass Pike to Fenway Park . The Sox , as usual , were out of it , but this looked to be Nomar Garciaparra 's last year at short , and Fidelis wanted to see him play there one more time . <p> " Excuse me , Dr. Emuwa ? " <p> Fidelis looked at the young man who had spoken , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm Brad Reynolds , Dr. Emuwa . I 'm a student here , and I wanted to tell you that I 'm sorry . " <p> " Sorry for what ? " Fidelis looked more closely at this Brad Reynolds . An unexceptional young man . Spots of red in his cheeks , a fraternity ring his only jewelry . He had the khaki-and-razor-cut look that business students had chosen since World War II . <p> " I bet four hundred bucks that you 'd be killed during the mission . " <p> Brad Reynolds looked down , then back up into Fidelis 's face . Gathering his courage , Fidelis thought . " I thought you 'd all get into some kind of fight over Jami Salter , and I figured David and Edgar were tougher than you . " <p> " You were right about that , " Fidelis said . <p> " I should n't have done it , " Reynolds went on . " It was a joke , you know , the whole thing . " Reynolds squinted at Fidelis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , " Fidelis said . " None of us were . " <p> The wedding of Deborah Green and Edgar Villareal took place on September 24th , 2012 , in the Garden of the Gods outside Colorado Springs . It was attended by forty-seven people and half a dozen hovering video drones sent by the more gossipy newsnets . The bride wore white . Her veil was beaded with pearls . The groom wore a morning suit , and was proud of having tied his cravat himself . <p> They had written their own vows , and the ceremony was quick . The only commotion occurred when Edgar 's cousin Gerardo " accidentally " scattered the news drones by blasting through them in an old F-4 borrowed from the Air Force Academy , where both Edgar and Deborah had graduated too many years before . Afterward the newlyweds presided over their reception at the Broadmoor Hotel before hopping into Edgar 's restored 1959 Bel Air and heading off on a driving honeymoon through the Rocky Mountain West . <p> No members of the Argos I crew were invited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , January 14 , 2013 : <p> David Fontenot : We found seventeen species of extraterrestrial life . We found enough water to ensure that colonization of Mars could be beneficial and productive in the long term . But mostly people were interested in a faked pornographic video of our engineer and backup pilot , and I think Jami could n't come back to that . I think it got the better of her , and I think the only reason the rest of us survived is because she took the pressure of all that voyeurism onto herself . <p> That 's all I have to say , Senators . <p> Author Affiliation
