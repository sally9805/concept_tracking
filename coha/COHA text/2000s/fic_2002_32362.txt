Chapter OneThe wind was shrieking through the narrow pass , bitter and cold , piercing right through her well-worn cape . Isabella Vernaducci pulled the long fur-lined cape closer around her shivering body and glanced anxiously at the high cliffs rising sharply overhead on either side . It was no wonder the don 's army had never been defeated in battle . It was impossible to scale those terrible cliffs that rose straight up into air , like towers reaching to the clouds . There was a shadow lurking within Isabella , an impression of danger . It had been growing steadily stronger in the last few hours as she traveled . She ducked her head into the horse 's mane in an attempt to gain some relief from the unrelenting wind . Her guide had deserted her hours earlier , leaving her to find her own way along the narrow , twisting trail . Her horse was nervous , tossing its head and jumping skittishly from side to side , showing every sign it wanted to bolt as well . She had the sensation that something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could hear an occasional grunt , almost like a cough-a strange noise she 'd never heard before . Isabella leaned forward , whispering softly , soothingly into the ears of her mount . Her mare was used to her , trusted her , and , although its great body was trembling , the animal madea valiant effort to continue forward . Icy particles stung both horse and rider , like angry bees piercing flesh . The horse shuddered and danced but moved stoically forward . She had been warned repeatedly of the danger , of the wild beasts roaming freely in the Alps , but she had no choice . Somewhere up ahead of her was the only man who might save her brother . She had sacrificed all to get here , and she would not turn back now . She had sold everything she had of value to find this man , had given what remained of her money to the guide , and had gone the last two days without food or sleep . Nothing mattered but that she find the don . She had nowhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted an audience with him , no matter how elusive , no matter how dangerous and powerful he was . His own people , so loyal they refused to help her , had warned her to stay away . His lands were enormous , his holdings vast . Villages and townships whispered of him , the man they looked to for protection , the one they feared above all others . His reputation was legend . And lethal . It was said he was untouchable . Armies attempting to march into his holdings had been buried by snow or rock slides . His enemies died swift and brutal deaths . Isabella had persisted despite all warnings , all accidents , the weather , every obstacle . She would not turn back no matter how the voices in the wind howled at her , no matter how icy the storm . She would see him . Isabella glared up at the sky . " I will find you . I will see you , " she declared firmly , a challenge of her own . " I am a Vernaducci . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she felt convinced that somehow the owner of the great palazzo was commanding the very weather , throwing obstacles into her path . A noise like grating rock captured her attention , and , frowning , She swung her head around to look up at one steep slope . Pebbles were bouncing down the mountain , picking up speed , dislodging other rocks . Her horse leapt forward , squealing in alarm as a shower of debris pelted them from above . She heard the chink of the horse 's hooves as it scrambled for purchase , felt the great muscles bunching under her as the animal fought to stay on its feet amidst the rolling rocks . Isabella s fingers were nearly numb as she gripped the reins . She could n't lose her seat ! She would never survive the bitter cold and the wolf packs that roamed freely through the territory . Her horse crow-hopped , stiff-legged , each movement jarring Isabella until even her teeth ached from the impact . It was desperation more than expertise that kept her in the saddle . The wind lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of her eyes . Her tightly braided hair was whipped into a frenzy of long , silken strands , pried loose by the fury of the coming storm . Isabella kicked her mare hard , urging it forward , wanting to be out of the pass . Winter was fast approaching , and with it would come heavier snowfalls . A few more days and she never would have made it through the narrow pass . Shivering , teeth chattering , she urged the horse along the winding trail . Once she was out of the pass , the rising mountain on her left side dropped away to a ledge that appeared crumbling and unstable . She could see jagged rocks far below , a drop-off she had no hope of surviving should her horse lose its footing . Isabella forced herself to remain calm even as her boot scraped along the mountainside . Small rocks tumbled from above , rolled and bounced on the narrow ledge , and careened off into empty space . She felt it then , an oddly disorienting sensation , as if the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had awakened upon her entrance into the valley . With renewed fury the wind slashed and tore at her , ice crystals burning her face and any part of her skin that was exposed . She continued riding for another hour while the wind came at her from all directions . If blew fiercely , viciously , seemingly directing itself toward her . Overhead , storm clouds gathered rather than move swiftly away with the wind . Her fingers tightened into fists around the reins . There had been a hundred delaying tactics . Small incidents . Accidents . The sound of voices murmuring hideously in the wind . Strange , noxious smells . The howling of wolves . Worst was the terrible far-off roar of an unknown beast . She would n't turn back . She could n't turn back . She had no choice . She was beginning to believe the evil things said about this man . He was mysterious , elusive , dark and dangerous . A man to avoid . Some said he could command the very heavens , that the beasts below did his bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , had to throw herself on his mercy if that was what it took . The horse rounded the next bend , and Isabella felt the breath leave her body . She was there . She had made it . The castello was real , not a figment of someone 's imagination . It rose up out of the mountainside , part rock , part marble , a huge , hulking palazzo , impossibly large and sprawling . It looked evil in the gathering dusk , staring with blank eyes , the rows of windows frightening in the lashing wind . The structure was several stories high , with long battlements , high , rounded turrets , and great towers . She could make out large stone lions guarding the towers , stone harpies with razor-sharp beaks perched on the eaves . Empty but all-seeing eyes stared at her from every direction ; watching her silently . Her mare shifted nervously , sidestepping , tossing its head , eyes rolling in fear . Isabella 's heart began to pound so loudly it was thunder in her ears . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't suppress the terror welling up inside her . She had done what was said to be impossible . She was in sheer wilderness , and whatever manner of man lived here was as untamed as the land he claimed dominion over . Lifting her chin , Isabella slid from the back of the horse , clinging to the saddle to keep from falling . Her feet were numb , her legs wobbly , refusing to support her . She stood still for several moments , breathing deeply , waiting to recover her strength . She stared up at the castello , her teeth worrying her lower lip . Now that she was actually here , now that she had found him , she had no idea what she was going to do . White wisps of fog wound around the palazzo 's columns , creating an eerie effect . The fog stayed in place , seemingly anchored there despite the ferocious wind ripping at her . She walked the horse as close to the castello as she could manage , tying the reins securely , not wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried patting the mare 's heaving sides , but her hands were clumsy and burning with cold . " We made it , " she whispered softly . " Grazie . " Hunching deeper into her cape , she pulled the hood up around her head and was swallowed by the garment . Stumbling in the vicious wind , she made her way to the steep steps . For some reason she had been certain the castello would be in a state of disrepair , but the steps were a solid , shiny marble beneath her feet . Slippery with the tiny ice particles on them . Huge lion heads were carved on the great double doors , incongruous so far out in the Alpine wilderness . The eyes were staring fiercely , the manes shaggy , and the great muzzles open , revealing fangs . The knocker was inside one mouth , and she was forced to put her hand in past the teeth . Taking a deep breath , she reached in , careful not to cut her flesh on the sharpened spikes . She let the knocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palazzo while the wind lashed at the windows , furious that she had escaped into the comparative shelter of the rows of columns and buttresses . Shaking with cold , her legs weak , she leaned against the wall and tucked her hands inside her cape . He was within the walls of the castello . She knew he was home . She felt him . Dark . Dangerous . A monster lying in wait ... He was watching her . She felt eyes on her , malevolent , malicious , venomous eyes . Something evil lurked in the bowels of the palazzo , and with her peculiar sensitivity , she felt it like a fist around her heart . The compulsion to run back into the fury of the storm was strong . Self-preservation told her to stay in the shelter of the large castello , but instead , everything inside her rose up in rebellion . She could n't make herself knock again . Even her tremendous willpower seemed to desert her , and she actually turned toward the lashing wind , ready to take her chances there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not going to panic and run back to her horse . She actually grasped the heavy doorframe , her fingernails digging in hard to hold her in place . The creak of the door warned her . Soft . Ominous . Forbidding . A portent of danger . The interior beyond was dark . An elderly man dressed in severe black stood looking at her with sad eyes . " The Master will not see anyone . " Isabella froze where she was . Seconds earlier she had wanted nothing more than to run back to her horse and ride away as fast as she possibly could . Now she was annoyed . The storm was growing in a frenzy , sheets of ice slamming to earth , white crystals covering the ground almost instantly . As the door began to swing closed , she thrust one booted foot into the crack . Jamming her ice-cold hands into her pockets , she took a deep breath to calm her trembling body . " Well , he will have to change his mind . I shall see him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at her . He neither moved out of her way nor opened the door wider to allow her entry . Isabella refused to look away from him , refused to give in to the terrible warnings shrieking at her to run while she still had the chance . The storm was full-fledged now , the howling wind hurtling pieces of ice that felt like spears even into the shelter of the covered entryway . " I must put my horse in your stable . Please direct me immediately . " She lifted her chin and stared the servant down . The manservant hesitated , glanced into the darkened interior , and then slipped out , closing the door behind him . " You must leave this place . Go now . " He was whispering , his eyes restless and his gnarled hands shaking . " Go while you still can . " There was desperation in his eyes , pleading . His voice was a mere thread of sound , almost unheard in the bitter shrieking of the wind . Isabella could tell that his warning was genuine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible within that this man would send her out into an icy blizzard to take her chances with raw nature rather than have her enter the palazzo ? Where his eyes had been blank before , they were now filled with trepidation . She studied him for a moment , trying to judge his motives . He had a quiet dignity about him , a fierce pride , but she could smell his fear . It oozed out of his pores like sweat . The door opened a crack , no more . The servant stiffened . An older woman poked her gray-haired head out . " Betto , the master has said she must come in . " The male servant sagged for a fraction of time only , his hand shooting out to the doorframe to steady himself , but then he was bowing low . " I will see to your horse myself . " His voice was flat , revealing no emotion at all at his being caught in a lie . Isabella looked up at the high walls of the castello . It was a fortress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and heavy . Her chin rose , and she nodded at the older man . " Grazie tanto for going to so much trouble for me . " To warn me . The unspoken words hung between them . The man lifted an eyebrow . She was clearly an aristocratica . Women such as this one rarely even noticed a servant . He was shocked that she did n't berate him for his lie . That she seemed to understand he was desperately attempting to help her . To save her . He bowed again , hesitated slightly before turning toward the icy storm , then squared his shoulders in resignation . Isabella stepped across the threshold . Alarm triggered her heart to thud wildly . A thick stench of evil permeated the castello . It was a cloud , gray and somber and edged with malice . She took a deep , calming breath and looked around her . The entryway was quite spacious , tapers burning everywhere to light up the great hall and dispel the darkness she had glimpsed . As she stepped inside , a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a macabre dance . A hiss of hatred accompanied the wind . An audible hiss of acknowledgment . Whatever it was recognized her just as surely as she recognized it . The interior of the castello was immaculately clean . Wide-open spaces and high , vaulted ceilings gave the impression of a great cathedral . A series of columns rose to the ceilings , each ornately carved with winged creatures . Isabella could see the apparitions winding their way upward . The castello preyed on the senses-the artwork rich , the structure impressive-yet it was a trap for the unwary . Everything about the palazzo was beautiful , but something unearthly watched Isabella with terrible eyes , watched her with malignant hatred . " Follow me . The Master wishes you to be given a room . The storm is expected to last several days . " The woman smiled at her , her smile genuine , but her eyes held a hint of worry . " I am Sarina Sincini . " She stood there a moment waiting . Isabella opened her mouth to introduce herself , but no sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter silence in the huge palazzo . No creaking of timbers , no footsteps , no murmur of servants . It was as if the castello were waiting for her to utter her name aloud . She would n't give her name to this hideous palazzo , a living , breathing entity of evil . Her legs gave way , and she sat down abruptly on the marble tiles , close to tears , swaying with a dark dread that was a stone in her heart . " Oh , signorina , you must be so tired . " Signora Sincini immediately wrapped an arm around Isabella 's waist . " Allow me to help you . I can call a manservant to carry you if need be . " Isabella shook her head quickly . She was shaking with cold and weak from hunger and the terrible journey , but the truth was , it was the unnerving feeling of a malignant presence watching her that filled her with dread , that caused her already shaking legs to collapse beneath her . The feeling was strong . Carefully she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was run . Without warning , from somewhere close by a roar filled the silence . It was answered by a second , then a third . The horrifying noise erupted from every direction , near and far . For one terrible moment the sounds blended and surrounded them , shaking the very ground beneath their feet . The roars reverberated throughout the palazzo , filling the vaulted spaces and every distant corner . A strange series of coughlike grunts followed . Isabella , standing with Signora Sincini , felt the older woman stiffen . She could almost hear the servant 's heart thudding loudly in tune to her own . ( Continues ... )
