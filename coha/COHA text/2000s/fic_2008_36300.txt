The summer I turned thirteen , I thought I 'd killed a man . <p> That 's a heavy burden for a girl to hang on to , but it did n't surprise me so much to have that trouble come in the summer time . Every bad thing that ever happened to me seemed to happen in those long months . <p> The summer I turned five , Granny Rose died of a heart attack during the Independence Day fireworks . The summer I turned seven , my dog Skippy ran away with a tramp who jumped the train to Baltimore . And the summer I turned eleven , a drought took the corn crop and we could n't have any corn for my birthday , which is what I 'd always done because my favorite food was corn from Daddy 's field , boiled in a big pot . <p> To top it off , here in the South , summers are long and hot and sticky . They drag on and on , making slow things seem slower and bad things seem worse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings to my memory like the wet heat of southern Virginia . That year we had unbearable temperatures , and we had trouble , just that it was trouble of a different kind . It was the beginning of a time that taught me bad things can turn into good things , even though sometimes it takes a while for the good to come out . <p> The day I turned thirteen was one of those summer days when the air is so thick , you can see wavy lines above the tar on the rooftops . The kind of day when the sound of cicadas vibrates in your ears and everything smells like grass . <p> On that day , as Momma got ready for my birthday party , I told her that I wanted nothing to do with watermelon this year . <p> " We have some fine ones , " she told me . " Just do n't eat any . " <p> " But the boys will spit the seeds at us like they do all the time , " I said . " And they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 'll tell them not to , " she said absentmindedly as she checked her recipe again with that squinched-up look she always got when trying to concentrate . <p> I knew I was only another argument or two from being scolded , but I tried again . " Those boys wo n't listen to you . " <p> " Those boys will listen to me if they want to eat , " she replied before muttering something about needing a cup of oleo . <p> " They do n't even listen to Teacher at school , Momma . " <p> That last reply had done it , and I stepped back a ways as Momma picked up her wooden spoon and peered at me angrily , her free hand on her apron-covered hip . " Jessilyn Lassiter , I wo n't have you arguin ' with me . Now get on out of this house before your jabberin ' makes me mess up my biscuits . " <p> I knew better than to take another chance with her , and I went outside to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send us any breeze for my birthday , I was bound and determined to make my own , so I started pumping my legs to work up some speed . The breeze was slight but enough to give me a little relief . <p> I saw Gemma come out of the house carrying a big watermelon and a long knife , and I knew she had been sent out by her momma to cut it up . Gemma 's momma helped mine with chores , and her daddy worked in the fields . Sometimes Gemma would help her momma with things , and it always made me feel guilty to see her doing chores that I should have been doing . So I dug my feet into the dry dirt below me to slow down and hopped off the swing with a long leap , puffing dust up all around me . <p> I wandered to the picnic table where Gemma was rolling the green melon around to find just the right spot to cut into . " I guess this is for my party . " <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' ? " <p> " My momma never lets me come to your parties . " <p> " So ? Ai n't never a time you ca n't start somethin ' new . It 's my party , anyways . " <p> " It ai n't proper for the help to socialize with the family 's friends , Momma says . " <p> " Your momma and daddy have been workin ' here for as long as I can remember . You 're as close to family as we got around here , as I see it . I ai n't got no grandparents or nothin ' . " <p> Gemma scoffed at me with a sarcastic laugh . " When was the last time you saw one brown girl and one white girl in the same family ? " <p> I shrugged and watched her slice through the watermelon , both of us backing away to avoid the squirting juices . <p> " Looks like a good one , " Gemma said as the fragrant smell floated by on the first bit of a breeze we 'd seen all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys to hit me with . " <p> " Why do you let them boys pick on you ? " <p> " I do n't let ' em . I always push ' em or somethin ' . But they 're all bigger than me . What do you want me to do ? Pick a fight ? " <p> " Guess not . " A piece of the melon 's flesh flopped onto the table as Gemma cut it , and she popped it into her mouth thoughtfully . " I 'll never know why boys got to be so mean . " <p> " It 's part of their recipe , I guess . " I helped by piling the slices on a big platter , and I strategically picked as many seeds as I could find off the pieces before I stacked them . Never mind my dirty hands . " You come by around two o'clock , " I told her adamantly . " I 'll get you some cake and lemonade . You 're my best friend . You should be at my party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ribs as her momma went walking by us . <p> " Gemma Teague , " her momma said , " you girls gettin ' your chores done ? " <p> " Ai n't got no chores of my own , Miss Opal , " I told her . " I figured on helpin ' Gemma instead . " <p> " Then you two make certain you keep your minds on your work , ya hear ? " <p> " Yes 'm , " we both mumbled . <p> Gemma 's momma walked past , but she looked back at us a couple times with a funny look on her face like she figured we were planning something . <p> In a way we were , but I did n't see it as being a big caper or anything , so I continued by saying , " You know , I ai n't seein ' any sense in you not at least askin ' your momma if you can come by for cake . She 's usually understandin ' about things . " <p> " Every year it 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me come , and besides , I 'll bet your momma do n't want me here no more than my momma does . It just ai n't done . " <p> " ' It just ai n't done ' ! " I huffed . " Who makes up these rules , anyhow ? " <p> Gemma kept her eyes on her work and said nothing , but I knew her well enough to see that she did n't understand her words anymore than I did . <p> Momma called me from the open kitchen window , but I ignored it and kept after Gemma . " Now listen . You just come on by after we 've cut the cake and pretend to clean up somethin ' , and I 'll be sure you get some . " <p> " Ai n't no way I 'm gettin ' in trouble for some cake and lemonade that I 'll get after the party anyhow , " she argued . " You 're just bein ' stubborn . " <p> I sighed when Momma called me again . " She 's gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd think at thirteen I 'd be old enough to stop havin ' my momma order me to take baths . " <p> " You 'd never take one otherwise , " Gemma said . " Ai n't nobody wants to smell you then . " <p> " I hate takin ' baths on days this sticky . My hair never dries . " <p> " Takin ' a bath on a hot day ai n't never bad . " <p> " It is when the water 's hot as the air is . " <p> Gemma shook her head at me like she always did when I was being hardheaded . " Water 's water . Cools you off any which way . " <p> I did n't believe her , but I headed off to the kitchen , where Momma had filled the big metal tub we 'd had to take baths in ever since the bathroom faucets broke . The sheet she 'd hung across the doorway into the next room flapped as the breeze I 'd prayed for began to pick up . <p> I hopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tub . " It 's hot as boiled water , " I complained . <p> " Well then , we 'll have you for supper , " Momma replied as she measured out flour , obviously undisturbed by my discomfort . " Your guests will start gettin ' here in a half hour , so do n't dawdle unless you want everyone findin ' you in the tub . " <p> " Yes 'm . " <p> " And do n't forget to clean behind your ears . " <p> " Yes 'm . " <p> Water splashed as I washed with my usual lack of grace , landing droplets about the kitchen floor . It did n't really matter since Momma always made a mess when she cooked and the floor would need cleaning after she was done . No doubt the flour and water would mix into a fine paste , though , and she 'd have a few words to mutter as she tried to scrub it up . As she measured sugar , I could hear her praying , " Oh , dear Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anytime , anywhere . <p> By the time I 'd scrubbed and dried , the smell of biscuits was drifting through the house and Momma was putting the oil on for the chicken . She was a good cook , no matter the mess , and she always put on quite a show for these birthday parties . <p> As I walked up to my room , wrapped in a ragged blue towel , I heard Momma call after me not to forget to put on my dress . Then she added , " Please , Lord , let the girl look presentable . " I think Momma often wondered why , if she was to be blessed with a girl , she had to get one that mostly acted like a boy . <p> " No dungarees ! " she added . " And put on your church shoes . " <p> I rolled my eyes , knowing she was nowhere near me . I would never have dared to do it in front of her . I hated dressing up , but for every birthday , holiday , church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear one of the three dresses that Momma had made me . She was as fine with a needle as she was with a frying pan , but I hated dresses nonetheless . Mostly because when I wore them , I had to sit all proper in my chair , and I could n't do cartwheels , at least not without getting yelled at . But I put on the dress because I had to and buckled up my church shoes . <p> I could hear Daddy 's footsteps coming down the hall , and I turned to smile at him as he stopped at my doorway . <p> " Lookin ' pretty , dumplin ' , " Daddy said . <p> " That 's too bad . " <p> " Now , now . Ai n't nothin ' wrong with a girl lookin ' like a girl . " <p> " Who says wearin ' dresses is the only way to look like a girl ? " <p> Coming into the room , his dirty boots leaving marks that Momma would complain about later , Daddy tossed his hat onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the dress . " We do n't make the rules ; we just follow ' em . " <p> " Well , someone had to make the rules in the first place . We should just make new ones . " <p> " No doubt you will one day , Jessilyn , " he said with a sigh . " But for now , you 'd best follow your momma 's instructions . She ai n't one to be disobeyed . " <p> " Are you gon na be at the party ? " I asked hopefully , knowing full well that he 'd been in the fields all morning and looked in need of a nap . <p> " Would n't miss it , you know that . I got the corn on already . " Daddy rubbed his tired eyes , picked up his hat , and walked out , whacking the hat against his leg to loosen the dust . <p> He worked hard , especially this time of year , and no matter how many men were willing to work the fields , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had suspected of late , however , that he was working harder more out of necessity than a sense of duty . We 'd had fewer men to help than in years past , and it was n't due to lack of interest , I was sure . I 'd seen my daddy turn three men away just the day before . <p> Things were poor , especially in our parts , and for having a working farm and a good truck , we were fortunate . We even had some conveniences that other people envied , like a fancy icebox and a telephone , and Momma was pretty proud of that . We were n't rich like Mayor Tuttle and his wife , with their big columned house and fancy motor car , but we were thought to be well-off just the same . Momma and Daddy never talked money in front of me , and I decided not to fuss with it . It caused too many problems for adults from what I could see . What did I want to do with it ? <p> I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed to see Buddy Pernell was the first to arrive . I did n't like Buddy very much . But then , I did n't like many kids very much . I thanked him for coming-mainly because Momma 's glare told me to-and received the plate of cookies his momma handed me . In those days , we did n't give gifts at parties ; it was too extravagant . But every momma felt it only proper to bring some sort of favor along . <p> By the time we had a full crowd , one side of the food table was filled with jars of jelly , bowls of sugared strawberries , a couple pies , and even one tub of pickled pigs ' feet . I promptly removed those , but Momma stopped me cold . <p> " We accept all gifts with thanks , Jessilyn , " she hissed in my ear as she replaced the tub on the table . <p> " Even pigs ' feet ? " I argued . <p> " Yes ma'am ! Even pigs ' feet . " <p> It took only ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the other girls started screaming and ran for cover , but I fought back at the boys out of sheer pride . I did a little shoving , Momma did some yelling , but I got pummeled anyhow . <p> After we finished eating lunch , I spotted Gemma hanging laundry on the line and ran over to get her help brushing all those sticky seeds out of my hair . <p> " You ought to not let ' em do this to you , " she said . <p> " I told you before , " I said with my eyes shut tight to stand the pain of Gemma 's brushing , " they 're all bigger than me . " <p> " I think they 're too big for their britches . That 's the problem . " <p> " Maybe so , but that do n't change nothin ' . I still ca n't whip ' em . " <p> " Well , I did the best I could . " Gemma peered closely at my sun-streaked hair . " I ca n't see no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , " I told her . " I 'll find some critter to stick down Buddy Pernell 's knickers . He 's the one leadin ' the boys in the spittin ' . " <p> " You best be careful . Them boys might do somethin ' to hurt you back . " <p> " I ai n't scared of them , " I lied . " Besides , they got it comin ' . " <p> Gemma shook her head and grabbed a pair of Daddy 's socks to hang on the line . " You 're stubborn as a mule , Jessie . " <p> I figured she was right , but I was n't about to give her the satisfaction of hearing me say it . Instead , I rejoined the party , grabbed a piece of cake , and stood by watching the boys scuff about with each other , playing some kind of roughhouse tag . The other girls stood around watching the boys , giggling over how cute this one was and how strong that one was . I could n't figure them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said through a mouthful of frosting . " If you girls had any smarts , you 'd be playin ' tag right along with ' em . " <p> " Why do n't you ? " Ginny Lee Kidrey asked . <p> " I 'm eatin ' . Ai n't no reason to stuff down cake when I can play tag anytime I want . " <p> " You 're just a tomboy , Jessie Lassiter , " said Dolly Watson , who always wore dresses and perfume that smelled like dead roses . " What do you know about boys ? " <p> " Enough to know that they ai n't worth wastin ' time on . " <p> The girls turned their noses up at me-all but Ginny Lee , who was the only real friend I had outside of Gemma , and even she had started to become more like the other girls of late . <p> The only reason I even had those other children at the party was because Momma insisted on it . She liked entertaining guests , but in our parts we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took every chance she got . So every year I had to invite the kids from school to interrupt my summer vacation and celebrate my June birthday with a party . The only thing I ever liked about those parties was the food . I would have been satisfied to spend my birthday having boiled corn with Gemma . <p> Buddy Pernell stopped in front of me and tugged at my braid . " Still stuffin ' your face ? " he asked with a smirk . " Do n't you like to do nothin ' but eat ? " <p> Knowing my short temper , all the boys loved to tease me just to see how much they could rile me . I responded to Buddy in my usual way . " I just like standin ' here watchin ' you boys beat each other up . And besides , ai n't nothin ' wrong with eatin ' . " <p> " There is if it makes you fat . " <p> " I ai n't fat ! " <p> " You keep eatin ' like that and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my momma was n't fat . I knew that as well as I knew that Buddy Pernell 's momma was . But it did n't matter . True or not , he 'd insulted my momma , and it took me no time at all to react by shoving what was left of my cake right into Buddy 's face , making extra sure to push upward so the frosting would fill his freckled nose . <p> Buddy was n't so brave then . He began clawing at his face like I 'd thrown acid on it , crying something fierce about not being able to breathe . <p> Momma ran over , hysterical , simultaneously scolding me and coddling Buddy . I responded to her by saying I 'd never heard of anyone suffocating on cake before , but she did n't appreciate my rationalizing . I got a whack from her left hand and Buddy got a wipe across his face from her right . ( Continues ... ) <p>                    @
