Millions Chapter One If Anthony was telling this story , he 'd start with the money . It always comes down to money , he says , so you might as well start there . He 'd probably put , " Once upon a time there were 229,370 little pounds sterling , " and go on till he got to , " and they all lived happily ever after in a high-interest bank account . " But he 's not telling this story . I am . Personally , I like to start with the patron saint of whatever it is . For instance , when we had to write about moving house for Literacy Hour , I put : Moving House by Damian Cunningham , Fourth Grade We have just moved house to 7 Cromarty Close . The patron saint of moving house is St. Anne ( first century ) . She was the Mother of Our Lady . Our Lady did not die but floated up into Heaven while still fairly young . St. Anne was upset . To cheer her up , four angels picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , where it can be seen to this day . You can pray to St. Anne for help with moving house . She will watch over you , but not do actual removals . Anne is also the patron saint of miners , horse-riding , cabinetmakers andthe city of Norwich . While alive , she performed many wonders . The patron saint of this story is St. Francis of Assisi ( 11811226 ) , because it all sort of started with a robbery and the first saintish thing he ever did was a robbery . He stole some cloth from his father and gave it to the poor . There is a patron saint of actual robbers  --  Dismas ( first century )  --  but I 'm not an actual robber . I was only trying to be good . It was our first day at Great Ditton Primary School . The sign outside says , " Great Ditton Primary  --  Creating Excellence for a New Community . " " See that ? " said Dad as he handed us our lunches and left us at the gates . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what they 're after . My instruction for the day is , Be excellent . ' The instructions for supper I 'll leave on the fridge door . " One thing about me is that I always really try to do whatever Dad tells me . It 's not that I think he 'll go off and leave us if we 're a problem , but why take that risk ? So I was excellent first lesson . Mr. Quinn was doing " People We Admire " for Art Hour . A huge boy with a freckly neck nominated Sir Alex Ferguson and listed all the football trophies United had won under his stewardship . A boy called Jake said players were more important than managers and nominated Wayne Rooney for individual flair . Mr. Quinn was looking around the room . To be educational about it , football was not taking him where he wanted to go . I put my hand up . He asked a girl . " Do n't know any footballers , sir . " " It does n't have to be a footballer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " I used my other hand to hoist my hand up higher . " Damian , who do you admire ? " By now , most of the others were into players versus managers . I said , " St. Roch , sir . " The others stopped talking . " Who does he play for ? " " No one , sir . He 's a saint . " The others went back to football . " He caught the plague and hid in the woods so he would n't infect anyone , and a dog came and fed him every day . Then he started to do miraculous cures and people came to see him  --  hundreds of people  --  in his hut in the woods . He was so worried about saying the wrong thing to someone that he did n't say a word for the last ten years of his life . " " We could do with a few like him in this class . Thank you , Damian . " " He 's the patron saint of plague , cholera and skin complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you learn something new . " He was looking for someone else now , but I was enjoying being excellent . Catherine of Alexandria ( 4th century ) came to mind . " They wanted her to marry a king , but she said she was married to Christ . So they tried to crush her on a big wooden wheel , but it shattered into a thousand splinters  --  huge sharp splinters  --  which flew into the crowd , killing and blinding many bystanders . " " That 's a bit harsh . Collateral damage , eh ? Well , thank you , Damian . " By now everyone had stopped debating players versus managers . They were all listening to me . " After that they chopped her head off . Which did kill her , but instead of blood , milk came spurting out of her neck . That was one of her wonders . " " Thank you , Damian . " " She 's the patron saint of nurses , fireworks , wheel-makers and the town of Dunstable ( Bedfordshire ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin martyr . There are other great virgin martyrs . For instance , St. Sexburga of Ely ( 670700 ) . " Everyone started laughing . Everyone always laughs at that name . They probably laughed at it in 670700 too . " Sexburga was Queen of Kent . She had four sisters , who all became saints . They were called  --  " Before I could say Ethelburga and Withburga , Mr. Quinn said , " Damian , I did say thank you . " He actually said thank you three times . If that does n't make me excellent , I do n't know what does . I was also an artistic inspiration , as nearly all the boys painted pictures of the collateral damage at the execution of St. Catherine . There were a lot of fatal flying splinters and milk spurting out of necks . Jake painted Wayne Rooney , but he was the only one .
