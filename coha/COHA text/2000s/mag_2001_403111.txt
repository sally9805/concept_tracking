On your way home from work , toddler in tow , you stop at the supermarket for some last-minute supper items . While waiting at the checkout , your child goes into a rage because you wo n't buy him a chocolate bar . It 's all you can do to keep your own temper in check . You should ... a ) Ignore him . b ) Give him the candy bar . c ) Abandon your shopping and escape the store as fast as you can . d ) Try to distract him . Rita Harrison and Randi Knight , who are behaviour therapists at the Children 's Hospital at Hamilton 's Chedoke Child and Family Centre , agree that ignoring the tantrum is the best , albeit most difficult , option . Buying the candy bar tells your toddler that tantrums get results . You also concede control if you abandon your shopping every time your toddler lets out a howl at the checkout . Of course , toddler meltdowns are often more about their state of well-being than the incident that triggered them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toddler is tired , hungry or generally at the end of his tether , consider a soup-and-sandwich dinner so you can avoid the store altogether . If you must go in , first pick up a cheese bun or another nutritious snack for your junior shopper , then pare your shopping list down to essentials and make a quick exit . If you do get caught in checkout chaos , try to concentrate on the needs of your unhappy child and your own need to get groceries , even while under the stern scrutiny of fellow shoppers . When her son , Jonah , now seven , threw his first public tantrum several years ago , Tara Kilmer discovered that by stealing the focus , she was able to distract him and appease her audience . " I knew everyone was looking at me , but I was n't going to be embarrassed , " explains the Peterborough , Ontario mom . " I said , so everyone could hear , " Jonah is having a temper tantrum because he ca n't have cookies . Little boys and girls have temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop some time or they wo n't get home in time for grandma . ' " Kilmer happily reports that Jonah stopped flailing , urged her to hurry and they gracefully bowed out of their public drama , groceries in hand . When you started back to work full-time recently , you enrolled your 18-month-old in daycare . The first few weeks seemed to go fine , but yesterday your toddler sank her teeth into a playmate 's arm . This morning , she got frustrated as you helped her get her coat off and bit you on the shoulder . You do n't want this to develop into a bad habit . You should ... a ) Tell your toddler , " No . Biting hurts , " and give her a time out . b ) Bite her back . c ) Tell her , " No . Biting hurts , " and drop some Tabasco on her tongue . d ) Give her a teether or soft toy and say , " Biting hurts people . Use this . " Donna McCreadie has heard  --  and considered  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Tabasco on the tongue . But , she says , " I did n't want to do something to him that I would n't like . " She also knew biting back merely showed him that his action was OK . So , every time Cameron chomped a victim , the Langley , BC mom promptly and firmly told him , " No . Biting hurts , " and swooped him away from the scene . It 's a good approach , according to Fran Kammermayer , who works with Family Services of the North Shore in North Vancouver . A biting child , she says , does n't have the words to communicate and often is " looking for attention because her life has been disrupted . " The teether substitute is also a good option , says Kammermayer , especially with younger biters who are still exploring the world with their mouths . Patricia Corson , a professor of early childhood education at Toronto 's Ryerson Polytechnic University , adds that the parent needs to help her child adjust to the family 's more stressful morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little earlier and spend five minutes or more with your child at daycare , " says Corson . " That way there is n't the perception that the child is being pushed in the door and mom is rushing to something more important . " Another point to keep in mind is consistency . Kammermayer advises that parents match the anti-biting technique they use at home with the one at their child 's daycare . With one setting reinforcing the other , your little chomper is bound to get the message . You hear a crash from the TV room , and run in to discover a vase in pieces on the floor . You ask your four-year-old what happened and she says her 11-month-old sister knocked it over . You know from the height of the shelf the vase was sitting on that this ca n't be true . You should ...

Do n't lie to me. " d ) Sit both your children down and tell them the story of Pinocchio . Four-year-olds , says Patricia Corson , " are interested in pleasing adults . " Responding to a child 's lie with anger simply traps your child into lying again . After all , Corson explains , your child can see you 're upset , so she 's not likely to confess to something that she knows will annoy you more . In fact , parents should be careful not to prompt fibbing in the first place by asking questions they already know the answer to . Since , in this scenario , the parent has inadvertently created a dilemma for her daughter , Corson says the best response is simply to remind the child about the importance of telling the truth and then carry through with logical consequences by asking her to help clean up the mess . And in light of the youngster 's growing physical ability , a new round of childproofing is also in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do chores around the house . Now , he 's in the habit of taking all his toys off the shelves and then refusing to put anything away . Even threatening no TV has n't straightened him out . You should ... a ) Explain to your child that he can do another activity only after the toys are picked up . b ) Take away most of the toys until he proves he can take care of them . c ) Pick up the toys yourself . d ) Leave the toys as they are until your four-year-old picks them up . Even by age four , kids are beginning to test their assertiveness , so Rita Harrison suggests that parents circumvent power struggles by adopting a when-then strategy . It works this way : You tell your child , " When the toys are picked up , then you can ... ( watch cartoons , read a book , go outside ) . " Thus , your child can do what he wants , but only after he does what you want . The beauty of the strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child ca n't argue and you 're not saying no to your child . " Of course , being kids , they will anyway . That , says Windsor , Ontario mom Shannon Kondracki , is when a toy time out is needed . " When my daughter will not pick up her toys , " she says , " we tell her that she 'll lose the toy for a period of time  --  maybe a day or two . " This usually helps move the cleaning-up along . If it does n't , the toys go on a " time out . " That , thinks Kondracki , is a more effective solution than putting her daughter in one . Remember , though , that a big mess may simply be too much for a four-year-old to tackle alone , and you might have to roll up your sleeves and teach while you help . Tara Kilmer has happily discovered that older siblings can be a tidy-up-time boon . " Devin can get overwhelmed , " says Kilmer of her four-year-old . " But seven-year-old Jonah keeps his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at a time : First the blocks , then the cars . " Your nine-year-old has begun to talk back to you and his dad . You do n't mind that he questions some of your decisions  --  in fact , you 've always encouraged him to be both thoughtful and critical . However , you ca n't stand his new haughty tone and sometimes hurtful remarks , and you are concerned that he may be talking back to teachers and other adults . You should ... a ) Tell your child , " Do n't talk to me like that . Go to your room . " b ) Ignore it , he 's just adopting the tone of TV sitcoms. c ) Tell your child his approach hurts and does n't contribute to solving problems . As much as you may want to send your child directly to his room , it will be more productive to respond with dialogue . Child psychiatrist Jean Clinton notes that at around age nine or ten , kids start to assert their own separate identity . That said , parents must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in control . " Focus on the thoughtful and critical approach you 've already encouraged by saying , for example , " There are some things you feel pretty strongly about here , but when you talk to me in that way , I do n't feel like problem-solving with you . I feel like telling you to stop it and go to your room . " Sometimes , adds Kammermayer , it 's more productive to talk when everyone is calmer . Still , you need to let your child know that his rudeness will not be tolerated . Tell him , " I will not be spoken to like that , so I 'm leaving . When you want to talk reasonably , I 'll be ready . " As for your child speaking rudely to other adults , Mimi Hudson , coordinator of parent education at Family Services of the North Shore in North Vancouver , notes that kids tend to push boundaries first within the safety of their own home , so acting out at school is likely not an issue . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your child 's behaviour , you do need to determine if he is having trouble coping at school . " Even though we foster dialogue with our kids , " she says , " it does n't always mean that as soon as something happens , they 're going to come home and tell you . " Graph Not Transcribed Your son 's ten-year-old friend has joined you for an afternoon outing and then an hour of Nintendo . As he heads home for dinner , you remind him to check in your car for his baseball cap . As he does this , you notice him reach across the passenger seat to the shelf where you keep your spare change . Sure enough , when you check , a toonie is gone . You should ... a ) Ignore it ; it 's only a toonie. b ) Call the child 's parents . c ) Ask him to return the toonie the next time you see him . d ) Tell your son to ask his friend to bring the toonie back . " I talk with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toronto mom ( name changed by request ) . " This was no different . I asked them what I should do and on their advice , I called the boy 's mom . " But according to Jean Clinton , Beeton 's approach is wrong on two counts . First , " it 's an age where kids are very attuned to loyalty to their friends . " So talking with your own children about the actions of a buddy may not only cause a rift in their friendship , but could lead to conflict between you and your child . ( Of course , the incident may prompt you to have a conversation with your kids about honesty , but initiate it without reference to the missing toonie . ) Second , while it would be appropriate to call a child 's parents if the stealing continues , Clinton suggests that a single act of petty theft does not indicate a deeper problem . " I assume that this is one of those dumb , impulsive moves that people of all ages are capable of , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the doubt . Tell him , in private , that lifting loose change is not an acceptable behaviour in your house , and then let him make amends by returning the coin . Graph Not Transcribed As you are scooping up your 12-year-old son 's clothes for the wash , a pack of cigarettes falls from his pocket . You should ... a ) Make him smoke the whole pack at one sitting . b ) Tell him how disappointed you are and ground him for two weeks . c ) Throw the cigarettes out and do n't mention that you found them . d ) Show your son the cigarettes and ask him to tell you about his habit . This is a situation ripe for overreaction , says Kammermayer , especially if the boy 's parents are non-smokers . And over-emphasizing your disappointment has too much emotional clout , says Clinton . The best approach , both agree , is to cool down and then calmly lay out the health reasons why your child 's smoking concerns you . Encourage him to explain his reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not to smoke . While you want to acknowledge the pressure he feels to conform , it 's best to avoid the " When I was your age " lecture . Instead , try role-playing strategies that will help him hold his own when he quits . You have always insisted that your 12-year-old daughter stay in on school nights . This is not only so she can focus on her homework and get enough sleep , but also because with two younger kids , you do n't want to have to pile everyone in the car while you chauffeur her around . Now , though , she is wailing because all her friends go to movies and other events mid-week . You should ... a ) Tell her , " Rules are rules . End of discussion . " b ) Lighten up . She 's old enough to go out on weeknights. c ) Tell her to make new friends . d ) Let her go out on the occasional weeknight , but to an event within reasonable boundaries . A 12-year-old 's social circle has a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . " If your daughter is wailing at you , " suggests Clinton , " it means she thinks you 're not going to listen . " You might say , " This is a rule we 've had . Tell me why we should change it now . " On the other hand , notes Rita Harrison , " parents often feel pressure themselves to give in because other kids are doing it . " You need to weigh your family values , the activity involved , your child 's ability to handle the responsibility and how the decision you make today will impact those you make in the future . Ideally , you 'll be able to negotiate a compromise that meets both your child 's need for a more active social life and yours for structure and safety . As Fran Kammermayer points out , while we need to show we are flexible , " life does have its grey areas and , as parents , we still are in charge of deciding when the grey areas are OK .
