Chapter OneVic Barnhardt slammed on the brakes of her black BMW . Adrenaline surged through her . She 'd almost hit him ! The guy in torn denims screamed something she could n't understand as he thumped on her hood with the wooden handle of his sign . It said , " McIntire Makes Monopoly Money , " in childish letters . The metal dented with a thunk that echoed through the roadster over the shouting outside . Behind him a human chain of burly Visimorph security guards bulged as the crowd of protesters surged toward her . Vic leaned on her horn and stabbed at the button that locked the doors . Where did these crazies come from ? Hundreds of them , their mouths twisted in anger , shook their signs or their fists . A brown-uniformed guard jerked the guy back by his collar . Vic gunned into the parking garage . The release of PuppetMaster 12.1 was more than a week away . This was getting out of hand . The BMW squealed around a corner and Vic jammed it into a space on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nonsense . The morning 's rain had gummed up Sepulveda Boulevard and made her late for a meeting with her boss , Hugo Walz . Since she had n't bothered to show for last week 's meeting , she 'd better at least pretend to toe the line . She swung out of the car and slammed the door . It would be hours before she could begin work on what shereally cared about-Jodie . She chafed at that as she heaved her backpack over her plaid flannel shirt , then steadied her breathing before striding across the parking garage , her Doc Martens squeaking against the concrete . The smell of oil and robber hung in the brisk March air . Naming her project after Jodie Foster seemed right . A strong woman who bucked authority to do what she wanted . Vic managed a grin . Yeah . Coming out of the garage into a biting wind , she shielded her eyes against the late afternoon sun . Several protesters ran past her through the narrow alleyway . How did they get past the security guards ? Vic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alley sagging under a wall of people . Her pulse quickened . This was n't funny . The shouts turned triumphant as the fence broke . She was overwhelmed in seconds , and any hope of a sprint to the employee entrance was dashed . Vic struggled against the tide of jeans and flowered dresses . Elbows and knees and protest signs all prodded her . She yelped in pain and shoved back . These were n't people anymore , but screeching bits of hair and flesh . " Let me through ! " she shouted pointlessly . Hers was just another voice in the cacophony of screams . A flash of white helmet and black chin strap announced the arrival of the police , but that only intensified the surge around her . Vic could n't breathe . Pain shot through her as a placard connected with her head . The crowd swirled in sickening streams of color . Her knees hit the pavement . Someone stepped on her and someone else . Visions of soccer fans trampling people to death flashed through Vic 's brain . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being pulled out of quicksand . " You all right ? " a bass voice shouted over the tumult . She found herself clutched against a hard body wearing jeans and a plaid shirt not much different from her own . She looked up . Maybe it was the blow to her head , but the crowd seemed distant even as it jostled them . She saw intense blue-green eyes with a sad down-slant . A week 's beard hid the bottom half of her savior 's face . One blunt hand raked through thick hair worn too long , and pushed it from his eyes . She 'd seen pictures : John Reston , nemesis of Visimorph . " Hold on , " he yelled and slung her across his hip like a child . She clung to shoulders she could feel were massive underneath the plaid flannel , her breasts pressed to his barrel chest . He waded through the chaos , clearing a path with his other arm . He did n't seem to care whose head he cracked . Police and demonstrators alike gave way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelentingly male . Jeez , Vic , she commanded herself , get a grip . When they were clear of the crowd , Reston continued down the alleyway at a trot , oblivious to her breathless squirming . " Put me down , " Vic managed . He turned the corner and set her on a loading dock with an unceremonious thunk . Somehow he ended up standing between her parted thighs . Both he and she panted . The screaming , the whining of the sirens , seemed a long way off . She meant to thank him . After all , he had probably saved her life . But was n't he responsible , too ? He was the driving force behind these protests . The way he had just hauled her around like so much luggage-and here he stood staring at her as if she were some kind of circus animal . " Maniac ! What gives you the right to stage attacks on people just trying to go to work ? " " Sorry , " he muttered , his expression rueful . " This got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her gazed flicked over him . He looked like some Greenpeace geek with that long hair . His jeans were torn at the knee . Then there were those eyes . And the mouth . What kind of lips hid under that beard ? She could n't quite see . His undershirt peeked from his flannel at the neck . It was the kind of shirt that would leave those powerful arms bare . Something in her wondered what he looked like without the flannel . Vic pushed that something down . " You ... you people are crazy ! " " I might say the same , " he growled . " You 're helping Bob McIntire hold the world 's computers for ransom . Every time he issues an upgrade , everybody has to repurchase something they already own just to function in society . Do n't you have a conscience ? " " And you brought the Justice Department down on him last year for antitrust . Do n't you remember what happened to the economy when they broke up Microsoft ? " " And now Visimorph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They glared at each other . Vic parted the gel that slicked back her short brown hair and fingered the lump beneath that was beginning to make her head ache . " You 're bleeding . " Reston touched her jaw to turn her head with callused fingers . Vic shuddered away as though she 'd been shocked by a taser . " I 'm fine . " " You 're not fine . " He slid a blunt , strong hand behind her neck and touched her chin again . Vic 's hands trembled . Must be the adrenaline wearing off . " You could use a stitch or two and a whiskey chaser for some Advil . " All Vic could do was stare at him , maybe because he was way too close . Did he have to be standing between her knees , for Christ 's sake ? And why did n't he move his hand off her neck ? " Do n't get hostile . I 'm not asking for a date . " Unexpectedly , he grinned . It made his eyes crinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled his hand away , he came up with the little queue of longer hair she kept tucked carefully under her collar when she was at Visimorph . " What 's this ? " he asked , smiling . " You hiding some shred of femininity here ? " Vic slapped his hand away , anger rising in her throat . " What the hell do you know ? " He raised both hands in surrender . " Hey , what could I tell a Visimorph clone ? " Vic was outraged . " I 'm not ! " If there was one thing she was n't , it was a Visimorph clone . " No ? " He lifted his chin . She did n't owe this guy any explanations . So , why did she want to explain ? She examined those seriously blue-green eyes . It was none of his business that McIntire had bailed her out of jail for hacking so she could make Visimorph 's security systems impregnable against hackers just like herself . One misstep and she would be busted on a parole violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't matter to some fanatic like John Reston . She glanced away , then back . A muscle worked in Reston 's jaw . Did his eyes flash with disappointment ? He did n't say a word , just put his hands around her waist and lifted her off the loading dock . She could n't help but grasp his forearms where the sleeves were rolled to his elbow . The light hairs over the cords of heavy muscle made her feel fluttery . " You 'd better get round to the front door , " he muttered , " if you want to go to work so badly . " She pulled away and stalked around the loading dock without looking back . Arrogant bastard ! When she was sure he could n't see her , she peeked over the platform . He was looking at the spot where she had disappeared . After a moment , he shoved his hands in his jeans pockets and turned back toward the melee around the corner . The roar of the crowd washed over her again . A bullhorn demanded something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaths to calm down . There was no fooling herself about her reaction to this guy . How could she have so little control ? She jerked her thoughts back to Jodie and started the long trek around the huge Visimorph campus to the visitors entrance . The glowing silver symbols on the monitor burned in the darkness like the white light you walk toward after your heart stops beating . But tonight they did n't seem like salvation at all . Music pounded through her earphones . Instead of helping her concentrate , the syncopated rhythms and whining keyboards of the Shards just scraped her nerves . Vic knew she was close , either to a breakthrough or a breakdown . She scanned the code , her eyes scratchy and watering . She was the creator of Cerberus , the security program that defended Visimorph against the world . How come she could n't link a few borrowed neural nets ? Without robust links , all the power in the world would n't give Jodie the feel of sentience . Vic threw herself back in her ergonomically correct chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still there . She 'd skipped the stitches and the whiskey , but it had taken maximum doses of Advil to tone down the headache . What a day ! A riot , a clunk on the head . Then that Reston guy had thrown her all off balance . Not just his challenge about working with Visimorph . There was a reason she never allowed herself to get very attracted to men . It was distracting . She liked programs better : They operated on rules you could understand . The smell of stale coffee and recycled air mingled with the vague chemical odor from her printer . Vic tapped her headset , clicking over to a soothing track of Organic R &B; and took a swig of Diet Coke from the half-full can standing among several empties . At least she 'd had a great excuse for being late to Hugo 's meeting . She stood to stretch and surveyed the dim cubicles receding into the darkness beyond her own half walls . Everyone had gone . " Must be Friday , " she muttered . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight . Not Friday at all , but Saturday . She slumped into her chair and reached for her track pad . Forget John Reston . Some environmental crazy was not her type . Jodie was waiting to be born . Vic pushed her finger around . The cursor on the screen did n't move . " If this thing freezes up on me ... " Her threat collapsed . What would she do ? Despair or something . Wait a minute . The screen shimmered . The silver-blue figures trembled from top to bottom . What was going on here ? Vic peered closer as they stabilized . That section of code ... the groupings were different , were n't they ? And there ! Something was changing her work ! A virus ? Bile surged up from her stomach along with the panic . She could n't lose code now ! She lunged for the Utilities function to scan for a virus , but her cursor was still frozen . " God damn it ! " she whispered . Somebody was getting into her code . She stood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half walls outlined a maze for the Visimorph rats . Whoever it was , was working in the dark . She spun out of her cube and stalked down the corridor , peering into the workstations . Code glowed on a screen from Rick Chong 's cube . He was still here . " Hey , Chong , what 's the idea ? " Chong 's silhouette turned in the semidarkness . " And your meaning is ... ? " " I mean , are you messing with my code ? " She peered over his shoulder . Code from the Communicator upgrade her team was working gleamed in tidy lines . She took a breath . The blood pounding in her neck began to slow . Chong flipped on his desk light to get a better look at her . " You finally lost it ? " Vic cleared her throat . " I 'm having trouble with some ... changes I 'm trying to make . " " Are n't we all ? " He gestured at the screen . " What crappy programming on the Communicator ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're supposed to make the software elegant . You know , The Only Link You 'll Ever Need to the Outside World . ' " She quoted Sunters phone and Internet device 's ad campaign . " That 's why we 're redoing the operating system and not someone else . ' Cause we 're the best . " Chong shook his head in disgust . " Corporate bull . And only that company would have named these things for that Star Trek device deal . They 're such geeks . " As if that were the last straw . " Long for your samurai days , hacking for fun instead of for Corporate America ? " she asked . He grinned . " Do n't you ? " She suppressed most of a smile . " Sometimes . " Her eyes slid over him . His thick black hair was pulled into a ponytail maybe six inches long . He had the sleek muscles of a martial artist . Not the body type she liked most . That would be more like the infamous Mr. Reston . Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose , for safety 's sake . Smooth and lean . A blue-and-green flourish peeked from under one sleeve of his black t-shirt as it stretched around his biceps . A dragon ? A vine ? Why had she never noticed it ? She scanned his cube . A mahogany stick , polished and rounded , poked out of a gym bag . He did do martial arts . She 'd never asked him about himself , She 'd hired him because he 'd been a hacker , though he had n't actually been in jail , so he was n't on the slave labor program like she was . They were outsiders , both of them . Maybe she should know more about him , starting with whether that was a dragon or a vine . Down , Vic . This was just an echo of her encounter with John Reston . She was way out of control . Chong was her employee . Never dip in the company pool . Chong would probably be shocked if she came on to him . She was acutely conscious of her asexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair hidden away . New employees often mistook her for a guy until they saw her face . Her look was necessary to get taken seriously in the world of computers . A disguise . That was what she told herself , anyway . He 'd be even more shocked if he knew where she went after work . She pushed that thought away . " You got no life ? " she asked , fingering the metal clips on her ears . Silly question . " More than you . " He turned to his keyboard . His fingers skittered over the keys in little staccato blasts . He hit the last key with some bravado and looked up . His almond eyes were flat black . " Do n't worry , I 'm leaving . " Leaning back in his chair , he clasped his hands behind his neck , stretching , then glanced toward her cubicle . " Your private projects are none of my business , Vic . But do n't think I 'm stupid . There are private projects . " Vic flushed . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chong turned and clicked to save his code . " You might be a porn addict , of course . " He shut down and swiveled in her direction . " Probably not , though . So I ask myself , why do n't you work from home on whatever you 're doing ? I figure you need power . You 're after the Big One . " Vic tried not to look stricken , caught out . " Get off it . No one 's even sure it exists . " Some people thought Visimorph was trying to break into the hardware business at the top of the food chain . They were right . Visimorph was using light pipes : a billion photon streams generated by a laser , doing simultaneous computations right down in the basement here in Santa Monica . No silly little silicon chips for Visimorph . The light pipes would increase their computing power by about a zillion-fold . No telling what Bob-O could do with that kind of speed . McIntire called the huge computer Neuromancer , and Vic wondered if he remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never really read Gibson 's book . " It exists . And Visimorph uses Cerberus for security . " Chong smiled a Mona Lisa number . " I figure you go pretty much where you want . " " You figure wrong . " Vic shoved her hands into her jeans pockets . " Why do you think they wo n't let me work the upgrade ? They 've taken it way beyond my version . You could probably call it Hydro now with how the security layers must morph . " ( Continues ... )
