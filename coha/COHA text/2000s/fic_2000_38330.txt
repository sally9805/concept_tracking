IT WAS ANNIE 'S TURN TO be the Pain in the Ass . She was new to the family and we were n't sure if she 'd be much good at it , so we were all prepared to be extra supportive , but none of us guessed the lengths she would go to in order to succeed . I mean , we 'd have cared for her if she 'd gotten sick , and we 'd probably even have put up with insanity , but dying ? That 's above and beyond the call . <p> We did n't know she was dead right away . She had spread herself over Edgar 's shoulders and down around his chest and back the way she sometimes does when she 's sleepy , and her heat exchanger was sticking out in front of his face while he was trying to watch the vid , so he thought she was on the job . He did n't even notice that something was wrong when she started to stiffen up , ' cause he figured that was part of her plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right after she 'd joined the family and everyone wanted to see what a Morph could do . <p> It was kind of creepy . In her normal state she looks like a great big banana slug , so we had her on the kitchen table so we would n't have to bend down to talk to her . She told Edgar to come stand next to the table , and when he did she slithered over to him and then just sort of squooshed around his body and flowed up over his chest and around his back until she covered him from neck to waist . He said it tickled , but it looked gooey to me , and I said so . That 's when she hardened up . Her face was right under his , like the second head down on a totem pole , and she said , " No , check it out , " and went all hard . <p> I did n't want to touch her , but I was the designated Goody as well as the Little Girl that day so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knuckle on her and was relieved when she went " thunk , " but I still did n't want her crawling on me . I did n't let her do it until a couple weeks later when we were outside looking at the stars . She was showing us where she came from , and I was getting cold out there in the back yard without my jacket , so she flattened out and made a blanket for me . Mom draped her over my shoulders ( David was the Mom that night ) and she kind of cinched up around me so the cold air could n't get in , and it felt pretty good . Not gooey like I 'd expected . <p> Annie tried hard to fit in , even though she was so different . It was n't like she had much choice . Everyone in America had to belong to a standard family ; that was the law even for aliens . Maybe especially for aliens . Ilsa says the Family Values Laws were passed because of all the immigrants that came into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured the best way to keep America American was to teach everybody what it meant to grow up in a wholesome , nuclear family . <p> I do n't know about wholesome , but ours certainly goes nuclear often enough . There 's Edgar and Ilsa and David and me : two adults , a twelveyear-old boy ( only never call him " boy " unless he 's the designated Goody ) and a nine-year-old girl . I do n't mind " girl " ; it 's better than some of the things Edgar calls me when he 's being the Pain . You 'd think a forty-yearold man would outgrow some of that stuff , but he seems to take a perverse delight in it when it 's his turn . And Ilsa - when she 's both the Pain and the Little Girl at the same time , watch out . I do n't throw tantrums for ice cream all the time ; why should she ? <p> I do n't know why the government thinks four people sharing roles is the ideal family , but they do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " every few weeks . We did until we got Annie , anyway . Then we could hire out our extra time . I like hiring out as the Know-it-all . I can go into someone else 's house and tell them all the things they 're doing wrong , and they have to be polite and listen even though they want to strangle me . I guess the fact that I 'm still alive is proof that the nuclear family does sort of work okay after all . <p> The night Annie died , I was n't so sure . I was the Mom that day , David was the Little Boy ( which gave me a chance to say " Hey , act your age " whenever he 'd forget ) lisa was the Dad , and Edgar was the Little Girl . It was a fun combination , except like I said , Annie was the Pain and she had n't done it before , so we were all a little nervous . <p> Then Edgar got up to go pee and discovered that Annie was all stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to use the bathroom , " he said , but she did n't budge . <p> " Annie , get off , " he said , and he whacked her on the side , but she just went " bonk " and stayed put . <p> " Mommm , make her get off , " he whined . <p> I had decided to make a cherry pie and was regretting that I 'd bought unpitted cherries , so I was n't as supportive and nurturing as the Mom is supposed to be . I was sitting on the couch next to him with a bowl on my lap and a paring knife in my hand , hands gooey up to the wrists , so I just said , " Jesus , Edgar , chill . Annie , let him leak . " And for good measure I said , " Ilsa , help me with these damned cherries . " <p> She was reading the newspaper ; she just grunted and scratched her butt . <p> David piped up . " Just because you 're Mom today does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told him . " I can do anything I want . " <p> Edgar rapped Annie again . " Hey , I 'm not kidding here . I 've got to go . Get off . " He reached up to her top edge and tried to peel her from around his neck . <p> " Annie , " I said , " let him go . " <p> She still did n't do anything , so I said , " Hey , listen up . We do n't do bathroom humor in this family . " <p> Still nothing . I tried to look her in the eyes , and that 's when I realized all three of them were closed . <p> " She fell asleep ! " I said . " Hah , good one , Annie ! " <p> Edgar pinched her on the flank , but that did n't wake her up . Neither did tweaking her nose . <p> " Annie ? " he said . He looked down , his chin touching her forehead . " Annie ? " <p> THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried looking for information on the web , but when we searched on " Morpheus physiology " we got 97,368 hits , half of which said " XXX Live Alien Sex Acts On Your Screen ! ! ! " and stuff like that . Booooring . Edgar and David wanted to look , but I told them no . <p> Annie was n't responding at all . Near as I could tell she was n't even breathing , but she did n't need to when she was all stretched out like she was on Edgar , so that did n't really mean much . <p> He was getting kind of frantic . I mean , being trapped inside an alien was bad enough , but she had flowed down way below his waist before she 'd hardened , and he really did have to go . He finally said , " I think we 'd better go to the emergency room . " <p> That 's when I knew we were in trouble . We did n't go to the emergency room the time David tripped on the couch and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed herself in the hand coring an apple , either . If Edgar wanted to go now , then this was worse than that . <p> " What about the money ? " I asked . It was my job to be practical . We had insurance , but the deductable was way more than my allowance . <p> " Screw the money , " he said . " There 's something wrong . " <p> " Do n't say ' screw ' when you 're one of the children , dear , " said Ilsa . " But I think you 're right . We 'd better check this out . " <p> " Okay , " I said . " I 'll get the car . " <p> " No , let me ! " said David . <p> " All right , you do it , " I told him . I never understood why he thought driving was such a big deal . All you did was tell the car where to go ; it was n't like you could actually crash it or anything . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got all excited and ran for the garage , so I went into the kitchen and stuck the bowl of cut-up cherries into the fridge , then we all trooped after him . <p> He wanted to turn on the siren and lights , but Ilsa would n't let him . It costs more to do that , and it was n't like it would get us there any faster . Rush hour was way past , so we did n't need top priority at every light . <p> Once we got there we realized that transit time was only part of the equation anyway . The emergency room was full of people , and everybody had these little white tickets with numbers on them . There must have been sixty or seventy people in there , and the place was maybe twenty feet square . There were only a dozen chairs , so most of us had to stand shoulder to shoulder in the middle of the room . <p> It was painted in fast-food colors , like somebody had stuck a bomb in a barrel of mustard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a receptionist , just a door in the wall opposite the entrance , and a sign above the door that said , " Now serving number 46 . " I looked around for the ticket machine and saw it beside the door we 'd come in , but when I tried to get it to spit out a number for us the machine would n't let me have one until we 'd entered our insurance stuff and paid the deductible . Ilsa had to do that ; she was the only adult with a credit card in our family that night . <p> We got ticket number 98 . Ilsa gave it to me to hold , but David snatched it from my hand and stuck out his tongue at me . I said , " Hey , give that back , " but he did n't , and I did n't push it . Part of being the Mom is knowing what matters and what does n't . <p> I thought it was going to be a long wait , but the " Now serving " sign blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so later . <p> Edgar was crossing his legs and hopping up and down by now , and whenever he remembered his family role he 'd say in a loud voice , " I got ta pee ! " It was n't much of a stretch for him to be the Little Girl at that point . <p> David was squished in next to the wall . I tried to keep an eye on him , but it 's not easy being responsible when you 're short . It seemed like I 'd just turned away when I heard him say , " Oops . " <p> Edgar said , " What ? " <p> " Nothing , " he said , which is twelve-year-old for " Oh shit . " <p> Edgar looked over his shoulder - bending at the knees since the rest of him was stiff as a tree now - and said , " You dummy , that 's a double or nothing machine ! It just docked us for twice the deductible . " <p> " It 's not my fault , " David said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ticket sticking out of the slot . It had " Double " stamped on it in bold red ink . " What , did it just jump in there on its own ? " I asked . " I did n't know they could do that . " <p> " Damn it , " Edgar said to David , " Why ca n't you keep your hands off stuff you do n't understand ? " <p> " You must be the Pain today , " said an old woman who was standing next to David . She scowled at him , but with her it did n't look like she was playing a role . <p> " He 's a pain every day , " Edgar said , and it sounded like he meant it even more than his Little Girl character would account for . <p> " We 're up to 75 , " Ilsa said hopefully . <p> " Quick , " said Edgar , " Let 's try double or nothing again . Maybe we can at least get it back down to the original deductible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ilsa and Edgar exchanged that glance that adults do when they 're going to take over the family , and Edgar stuck the ticket back into the machine . I wanted to protest , but Ilsa was the Dad , and even though I was the Mom , it 's bad form to argue in public so I let them do it . <p> The machine beeped and flashed a hand of poker cards on the screen . Two twos , a three , a five , and a six . <p> " Go for the straight , " David told him , but Ilsa said , " That 's a sucker bet . " <p> " Chuck the three , five , and six , " I said . " Maybe you 'll get two pair . " <p> We were doomed already , but that was the only thing we could do , so he did it . Sure enough , we got a seven , a jack , and a queen . The machine showed its hand : a full house ; kings and aces . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> " The machine 's rigged , " Edgar said indignantly , snatching the ticket out of the slot . <p> " Well of course it 's rigged , dummy , " I told him . " This is a health care clinic . " That was n't the way to speak to a Little Girl , but he had already blown his role , so I did n't care . <p> " I got ta pee ! " he said again , maybe to reestablish his character or maybe because he was really uncomfortable now . <p> The people around us were inching forward , and more people were coming in behind us , so we cut our losses and joined the throng . When we got to the door , a snotty sign claimed it would only admit one family member with the patient , but we all crowded through anyway . We were paying for four ; we might as well get our money 's worth . <p> There was a conveyor belt just inside , like the luggage thing at the spaceport . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound up he nearly fell over again , but Ilsa got a shoulder under his arm and kept him upright until he caught his balance . David and I hung on as well , and the five of us chugged on down this long wide corridor toward the doctor . <p> We could n't see him immediately , of course . First we had to run the gauntlet of receptionists , nurses , and physicians ' assistants , each of whom asked the same questions . The conveyor did n't stop , though , so Edgar had to talk really fast , like , " Yes I 'm insured no it 's not a pre-existing condition yes I waive my right to sue for malpractice the problem is I 've got this alien ... " but by then it was too late ' cause the conveyor kept going . <p> We finally saw the doctor up ahead , wearing the traditional golf outfit and lobbing a bottle of pills at a patient who had already drifted past . There was another patient between us and him : the woman who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't wait for the doctor to ask what her problem was . As soon as she got within earshot , she said , " Migrane headache again , I tried cold , tried sitting in the dark , tried aspirin , tried codeine . I need Demerol ! " She was an old hand at this , by the sound of it . <p> The doctor nodded sagely as the conveyor carried her closer . " Certainly , my dear , " he said , " only now I can give you Synthedem ! It 's almost as good and only nine-tenths the cost . " <p> " No , dammit , I want my regular drugs ! " she said , but the doctor was already keying the prescription into the refrigerator-sized Pharmall Vendomatic beside him . The pills popped out of the hopper just as the woman slid past , and she scooped them up and said disgustedly , " I 'll be back with a butcher knife if these do n't work ! " <p> " They 'll work , " the doctor reassured her , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I do for - good God ! " <p> " It 's a Morpheus , " Edgar said . " I ca n't get her to move . " <p> " Get it out of here ! " the doctor said , backing away . <p> " Why ? " asked Edgar . <p> " Because if I get caught providing medicine to aliens , I 'll lose my license ! " <p> " Really ? " said Edgar , and he stepped off the conveyor belt . There was a little wall that was supposed to separate the patient from the doctor , but it was n't high enough to stop Edgar . <p> The doctor said , " Hey , you ca n't do that ! " but the rest of us climbed over the wall and surrounded him before he could run away . <p> " I 'm the patient , " Edgar said . " Annie 's the condition . " <p> The doctor took a quick glance at her , then looked away . " She 's dead . " <p> I felt my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself that night I think I would have cried , but I was the Mom , so I just bit my lip and did n't say anything . <p> Edgar was totally out of character by now . Having to pee can make you do that . He just said , " I see . Then I 'd like to have her removed . " <p> The doctor shook his head . " Sorry , that 's a surgical procedure . We do n't do surgery at this clinic . " <p> The patient behind us , a tall guy with a big wart on his nose , said " Aw shit " when he heard that , and rolled on past . <p> The next one , a teenage girl with a big pink wad of gum in her hair , stepped off the belt behind me and said , " Hey , it 's my turn ! " <p> " They wo n't do surgery , " David told her . <p> " That sucks . " <p> " You need a hairdresser anyway , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm supposed to be a senile old fart , " she said . <p> " Oh . In that case , you 've come to the right place . " <p> The next patient climbed off the conveyor , too . He really was a senile old fart , complete with cane . " My prostrates the size of a watermelon ! " he said . <p> " Prostate , " said the doctor . " Prostate . " <p> " No , I 'm from Iowa , " said the fart . Then a little switch seemed to flip over in his head and he raised his cane over his head and shouted , " Give me drugs ! " <p> The nurses and receptionists were already running to the rescue , but there was n't room enough for all of us around the doctor . And of course the conveyor belt kept depositing more people every few seconds . <p> I do n't know who threw the first punch . All I know is people suddenly started swinging . There was a lot of " Oof " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and people kept pounding on each other . The doctor and the nurses were hopping around like frogs , trying to stay out of it , but I saw one nurse wind up and take a good crack at the doctor when he was n't looking , so I edged over toward her and said , " Hey , do n't hit him or we 'll be here , all night . " <p> " Him ? " she said . " He does n't know squat about medicine . " We had to shout to be heard over the fight . <p> " Do you ? " I asked . <p> " Sure . What 's your problem ? " She pulled me back toward the wall just in time to avoid the old man 's wildly flailing cane . Ilsa and David came over , too , and we all hid behind one of those wheeled carts full of stuff . <p> " It 's our Morph , " I said . " She flowed over Edgar and then got all hard . I 'm afraid ... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get all choked up , because she was the Pain after all , but it was hard . <p> " I do n't think that 's as big a problem for Morphs as it is for us , " the nurse said . " They 're a lot tougher than we are . " <p> " Yeah , but dead is dead , is n't it ! " David asked . <p> " Not necessarily . Is that her ? " <p> She pointed at Edgar , who had waded into the middle of the fray and was trying to take the cane away from the old man . The old man was whacking at his side , but Annie was acting like a suit of armor , so it did n't matter . <p> " That 's her , " Ilsa said . <p> " Here , let 's try this , " said the nurse , taking a couple of round disks with handles on them from the cart . The guy with the cane had turned his attention to Edgar 's head , so she waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoved the disks against his Annie-covered shoulderblades . <p> There was a flash and a " zzzzt ! " like the time David stuck a fork into a light socket , and suddenly Annie whoofed out like an air bag in a collision , only she was n't smooth like an airbag ; she was all spikes . Hard spikes . The old man 's cane hit one right on the point and stuck there , and he could n't pull it loose . <p> The fight stopped just like that . <p> " Wow , " I said . " How 'd you know it would do that ? " <p> " We have a Morph in our family , too , " said the nurse . " She dies on us all the time . " <p> " I 've got to pee ! " Edgar shouted . " Annie , let me go ! " He whirled around , looking for a bathroom , nearly taking out half the people around him with the old man 's cane . <p> Annie shrank down a little and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , ripping her loose and dropping her on the floor , then running for a door just a few feet away . I did n't think it was a bathroom - it looked more like the doctor 's office - but he went on through and closed the door behind him . <p> " Annie ? " I asked , bending down and putting my hand on her now that the spikes were melting back into her body . " Annie , are you okay ? " <p> " I think so , " she said . She moved her face around so it was pointing up at me . " What happened ? " <p> " You died , " I told her . " Only the nurse zapped you back again . " <p> " Oh . Sorry . I was just thinking , and I guess I got a little too distracted and forgot to keep my metabolism going . " <p> " Thinking ? " I asked . " What were you thinking about so hard ? " <p> She laughed , and her body rippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good Pain in the Ass . I came up with quite a few ideas , too ! Want me to show you ? " <p> " No way , " I told her . <p> Then the doctor came up to us and said to Ilsa , " You 're going to pay for all this ! " <p> " On second thought , " I said to Annie , " go ahead . " <p> That 's all she needed . Within seconds , the air filled with a stink way worse than David 's gym socks . People were gagging and holding their noses and jumping back on the conveyor belt . Annie slithered up onto it , too , and lisa and David were right behind her . I turned to the nurse long enough to say " Thanks , " then went over and banged on the door that Edgar had gone through . " Meet us outside ! " I yelled . <p> " Jeez , ca n't a girl have a little privacy around here ? " he hollered back , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the conveyor . <p> There was a big crowd at the other end , and they all wanted a piece of us , but Annie drove them off with another alien stinker and we rushed on past . <p> Our eyes were watering by the time we got into the parking lot . We gasped for fresh air , and Ilsa said , " Enough ! For god 's sake , Annie , that 's enough ! " <p> " Oh , but I was just getting started , " she said . <p> " I do n't care . Behave yourself . " <p> Edgar ran out , still zipping up his pants , and we jumped in the car and told it to take us home . <p> On the way , Annie said , " I thought up another neat trick . Wan na see ? " <p> " No ! " we all said at once . <p> " How about if I just do a little - " <p> " No . " <p> I looked at my watch . Only six more hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I already knew one of the things I would do , too . If I waited until tomorrow to finish my pie , I would n't have to pit the rest of the cherries . People would just have to be careful when they chewed . And that electrical trick with Annie and the spikes - I was sure I could-come up with some use for that . <p> I could hardly wait . <p> Author Affiliation
