Major Rubaramira Ruranga knows something about fighting . During Idi Amin 's reign of terror in Uganda in the 1970s , Ruranga worked as a spy for rebels fighting the dictator . After Amin 's ouster , the military man studied political intelligence in Cuba before returning to find a new dictator at the helm and a bloody war raging . Hoping for change , Ruranga supplied his old rebel friends with more secrets , this time from within the President 's office . When he was discovered , he fled to the bush to " fight the struggle with guns . " <P> The turmoil in Uganda was fueling the spread of another enemy  --  AIDS . Like many rebel soldiers , Ruranga was on the move constantly to avoid detection . " You never see your wife , and so you get to a new place and meet someone else , " he says . " I had sex without protection with a few women . " Doctors found he was HIV positive in 1989 . " They told me I would die in two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was away . I told my kids , my wife . Worked on finishing the house for them . I gave up hope . " But as he learned about AIDS , his attitude changed . After talking to American and European AIDS activists  --  some had lived with the disease for 15 years or more  --  " I realized I was not going to die in a few years . I was reborn , determined to live . " <P> He began fighting again . After announcing his HIV status at a rally on World AIDS Day in 1993  --  an extraordinarily brave act in Africa , where few activists , let alone army officers , ever admit to having HIV  --  he set up a network for those living with HIV/AIDS in Uganda , " so that people had somewhere to go to talk to friends . " And while Uganda has done more to slow the spread of AIDS than any other country  --  in some places the rate of infection has dropped by half  --  " we can always do better , " says Ruranga . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill people and we are not able to buy drugs to save people ? " The fight continues . <P>  --  By Simon Robinson/Kampala
