Chapter One Day 1 10:04 a.m . Things never turn out the way you think they will . I never intended to become a househusband . Stay-at-home husband . Full-time dad , whatever you want to call it  --  there is no good term for it . But that 's what I had become in the last six months . Now I was in Crate &; Barrel in downtown San Jose , picking up some extra glasses , and while I was there I noticed they had a good selection of placemats . We needed more placemats ; the woven oval ones that Julia had bought a year ago were getting pretty worn , and the weave was crusted with baby food . The trouble was , they were woven , so you could n't wash them . So I stopped at the display to see if they had any placemats that might be good , and I found some pale blue ones that were nice , and I got some white napkins . And then some yellow placemats caught my eye , because they looked really bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't have six on the shelf , and I thought we 'd better have six , so I asked the salesgirl to look in the back and see if they had more . While she was gone I put the placemat on the table , and put a white dish on it , and then I put a yellow napkin next to it . The setting looked very cheerful , and I began to think maybe I should get eight instead of six . That was when my cell phone rang . It was Julia . " Hi , hon. " " Hi , Julia . How 's it going ? " I said . I could hear machinery in the background , a steady chugging . Probably the vacuum pump for the electron microscope . They had several scanning electron microscopes at her laboratory . She said , " What 're you doing ? " " Buying placemats , actually . " " Where ? " " Crate andBarrel . " She laughed . " You the only guy there ? " " No ... " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could tell Julia was completely uninterested in this conversation . Something else was on her mind . " Listen , I wanted to tell you , Jack , I 'm really sorry , but it 's going to be a late night again . " " Uh-huh ... " The salesgirl came back , carrying more yellow mats . Still holding the phone to my ear , I beckoned her over . I held up three fingers , and she put down three more mats . To Julia , I said , " Is everything all right ? " " Yeah , it 's just crazy like normal . We 're broadcasting a demo by satellite today to the VCs in Asia and Europe , and we 're having trouble with the satellite hookup at this end because the video truck they sent  --  oh , you do n't want to know ... anyway , we 're going to be delayed two hours , hon. Maybe more . I wo n't get back until eight at the earliest . Can you feed the kids and put them to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was n't . I was used to it . Lately , Julia had been working very long hours . Most nights she did n't get home until the children were asleep . Xymos Technology , the company she worked for , was trying to raise another round of venture capital  --  twenty million dollars  --  and there was a lot of pressure . Especially since Xymos was developing technology in what the company called " molecular manufacturing , " but which most people called nanotechnology . Nano was n't popular with the VCs  --  the venture capitalists  --  these days . Too many VCs had been burned in the last ten years with products that were supposedly just around the corner , but then never made it out of the lab . The VCs considered nano to be all promise , no products . Not that Julia needed to be told that ; she 'd worked for two VC firms herself . Originally trained as a child psychologist , she ended up as someone who specialized in " technology incubation , " helping fledgling technology companies get started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology . ) Eventually , she 'd stopped advising firms and joined one of them full-time . She was now a vice president at Xymos . Julia said Xymos had made several breakthroughs , and was far ahead of others in the field . She said they were just days away from a prototype commercial product . But I took what she said with a grain of salt . " Listen , Jack , I want to warn you , " she said , in a guilty voice , " that Eric is going to be upset . " " Why ? " " Well ... I told him I would come to the game . " " Julia , why ? We talked about making promises like this . There 's no way you can make that game . It 's at three o'clock . Why 'd you tell him you would ? " " I thought I could make it . " I sighed . It was , I told myself , a sign of her caring . " Okay . Do n't worry , honey . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack ? The placemats ? Whatever you do , just do n't get yellow , okay ? " And she hung up . I made spaghetti for dinner because there was never an argument about spaghetti . By eight o'clock , the two little ones were asleep , and Nicole was finishing her homework . She was twelve , and had to be in bed by ten o'clock , though she did n't like any of her friends to know that . The littlest one , Amanda , was just nine months . She was starting to crawl everywhere , and to stand up holding on to things . Eric was eight ; he was a soccer kid , and liked to play all the time , when he was n't dressing up as a knight and chasing his older sister around the house with his plastic sword . Nicole was in a modest phase of her life ; Eric liked nothing better than to grab her bra and go running around the house , shouting , " Nicky wears a bra-a ! Nicky wears a bra-a ! " while Nicole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yelled , " Dad ? He 's doing it again ! Dad ! " And I would have to go chase Eric and tell him not to touch his sister 's things .
