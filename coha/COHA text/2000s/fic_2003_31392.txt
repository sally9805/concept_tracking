In the darkness beyond the great Missouri 's shore ... In the darkness beyond the great Missouri 's shore at last lay the West , toward which Tasmin and her family , the numerous Berrybenders , had so long been tending . The Kaw , an unimpressive stream , had been passed that afternoon  --  Tasmin , Bobbety , Bess , and Mary had come ashore in the pirogue to see the prairies that were said to stretch west for a thousand miles ; but in fact they could hardly see anything , having arrived just at dusk . The stars were coming out  --  bright , high stars that did n't light the emptiness much , as a full moon might have done . Bess , called Buffum by the family , insisted that she had heard a buffalo cough , while Bobbety claimed to have seen a great fish leap at dusk , some great fish of the Missouri . The three older Berrybenders tramped for a time along the muddy shore , trailed , as usual , by the sinister and uncompromising Mary , aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour . In the last light they all stared at the gray grass and the brown slosh of water ; but the great fish of the Missouri did not leap again . Disappointed , the agile Bobbety at once caught a slimy green frog , which he foolishly tried to force down Mary 's dress , the predictable result of his actions being that the frog squirmed away while Mary , never one to be trifled with , bit Bobbety 's forefinger to the bone , causing him to blubber loudly , to Buffum 's great annoyance and Tasmin 's quiet contempt . Though Bobbety attempted to give his sister a sharp slap , Mary , like the frog , squirmed away and , for a time , was seen no more . " It is said that there are no schools anywhere in the American West , in this year of our Lord 1832 , " Bess declaimed , in her characteristically pompous way . The three of them were attempting to row the pirogue back to the big boat , but in fact their small craft was solidly grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gangrene , dropped the only paddle , which floated away . " Do get it , Tasmin ... I 'm bleeding ... I fear the piranhas will inevitably attack , " Bobbety whined ; his knowledge of natural history was of the slightest . Tasmin might readily have given him a succinct lecture on the normally benign nature of the piranha , in any case a fish of the Amazon , not the Missouri , but she decided to postpone the lecture and catch the paddle , a thing soon accomplished , the Missouri being distressingly shallow at that point of its long drainage . Tasmin got wet only to her knees . In her large family , the ancient , multifarious Berrybenders , Tasmin was invariably the one who recovered paddles , righted boats , posted letters , bound up wounds , corrected lessons , dried tears , cuffed the tardy , reproved the wicked , and lectured the ignorant , study having been her passion from her earliest days . Far out in the center of the broad stream , the steamer Rocky Mount seemed to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like themselves , in the clinging Missouri mud . Sounds of the evening 's carouse were just then wafting across the waves .
