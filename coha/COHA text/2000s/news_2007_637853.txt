<p> WHEN your boat cuts its engine at Mike 's Camp , you know it 's time to turn the BlackBerry off . The dock at this Indian Ocean resort , perched on the spine of Kiwayu Island , off the coast of Kenya , is pure Gilligan 's Island , a stick and twine arrangement jutting out from the bush . It leads to a flight of stairs made of sand ( I know , it does n't sound possible , but it is ) . Glancing back , past where you have just stepped off your boat , all you see are ribbons of water , green islands and sky . <p> You 're climbing , but you 're also sinking into vacation mode . The guide tells you to lose your shoes so you can walk better in the sand . He takes your bag . And then you arrive , barefoot and maybe a little thirsty , which is perfect for the cold cocktail that is about to be thrust into your hand , at big thatched-roof bungalow . Everyone  --  and everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prostrate on the palm-matted floor , a few fuzzy cats bask in the sun , and other than the shell mobiles tinkling in the breeze , everything is still . <p> Mike 's Camp has a lot going for it  --  the Zen vibe , the tasty Swahili food , the beaches straight out of the paradise manual , and the bucket shower . Call it rough-lux . It 's located on a choice strip of the Kenyan coast that is wild and beautiful but gets very few visitors . <p> While Lamu , another Indian Ocean island about 30 miles south of Kiwayu , has been thoroughly discovered , and the coastal city of Mombasa has the big hotels , the long arm of the tourist trade has barely touched Kiwayu . There are just two exclusive resorts , Mike 's Camp , also known as Munira Island Camp , and Kiwayu Safari Village . Both are stunning . Neither is especially easy on the wallet . And because of their seclusion and privacy , the two of them have become something of a hide-out for folks like Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is actually not all that hard to get to . SafariLink , an airline based in Nairobi , makes stops in Kiwayu en route to Lamu if there are two or more passengers , which usually translates into daily service and an easy leg to add to any East African safari . On the two-hour flight , I could n't get over how green and forested this part of Kenya is . The trees are packed so closely together , it looks as if you could n't slide a credit card between them . When we landed at a dirt airstrip , there was just a single Land Rover waiting in the shade , which took us to Kiwayu Safari Village , a resort owned by an Italian family . <p> How else to judge their influence but by the food ? Lunches were the classic Italian two-step of primi piatti and secondi like risotto with asparagus and cracked crab . <p> And dinners were definitely something to write home about . At the conch shell 's call , my wife , Courtenay , and I , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lounge for seaweed tempura and mini raw oysters  --  gourmet hors d'oeuvres masquerading as bar snacks . We then walked to the beach , where we feasted on calamari and enormous skewered shrimp at a candle-lit table planted in the sand . The sky was wallpapered with stars , all the way down to the horizon . ( After dinner , we were presented with the only hunk of Taleggio I have seen on the continent . ) <p> We waddled back to our room , a luxurious bungalow with soft lighting , a solar-heated shower and a giant clam shell at the entrance to rinse our feet . There were no doors , no hinges and no glass . <p> While I sank into bed , thinking , if this is good enough for Mick , it 's good enough for me , I heard something , something clicking . <p> Claws ? The mosquito net apparently kept out more than just mosquitoes : a pink crab was scaling the wall of fabric . A gentle swat sent it sidestepping back to the sand . <p> The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women offered us toy fish carved from washed up flip-flops . <p> Trolling the endless beaches is just one way to spend the day . Other options include picnics , dhow sailing or game drives into the bush right behind the resort , which is teeming with lions , giraffes , buffaloes and elephants . But most guests , the manager said , " just sit back and read books and love it . " <p> Sounds about right , I thought as I scanned the cushion-filled lounge , where two women in bikinis were dozing off to Norah Jones . I pondered the collision of this joint 's classy , European style with the predominantly Muslim local customs , remembering the laminated card in my room that warned " in the unlikely event of being approached when naked on the vast adjacent beaches , please cover yourselves . " <p> The owners of Kiwayu 's two resorts , thank goodness , are more friendly than competitive , and when it came time to go to Mike 's Camp , the staff at the safari village hailed Mike Kennedy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speedboat . <p> As soon as we arrived at the camp , one friend sighed : " Ah , the hippie version ! " At Mike 's , instead of his and hers porcelain basins in the bungalow , there was a silver bowl for a sink . The shower was a bucket on a pulley . The toilet ? Fill it yourself . <p> All the bungalows have priceless views , with miles of creeks and islands stretching to the west and the wide open Indian Ocean to the east . Space . That was the sense I had looking out from my room . Lots of space . I could even see Somalia , whose border is about 25 miles north , though none of that country 's chaos seemed able to reach me . <p> I spent my days in the water : water-skiing , snorkeling , boogie-boarding and diving off a coral cliff in a nearby village with 20 naked kids splashing and giggling around me . The resort is part of the Kiunga Marine National Reserve and home to sea tortoises and dugongs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mike can arrange boats . He insisted that it 's easy to catch marlin , barracuda , swordfish , sailfish , wahoo , snapper and tuna . " It 's like a supermarket out there , " Mike said . <p> And that 's the thing about Mike 's . It 's really all about , well , Mike . He 's a cheery , freckled , 50-year-old Kenyan , whose father was a colonial tea farmer from Britain . He joined us for a snorkel and hung out with us afterward at the beach hut he built , strung with hammocks . He sipped a sundowner with us that evening , as the African sky glowed orange and purple and pink . During dinner , family-style , of course , he regaled us with stories about sailing up and down the Swahili coast and exploring little islands . " They 're wonderful , " he said . " You just sit there and chip oysters off the rocks with your white wine and Tabasco sauce .
