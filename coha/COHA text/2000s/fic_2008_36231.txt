One <p> Downtown San Diego <p> Between the hours of eight and nine PM on a Thursday evening , a black Nissan Altima traveled through light traffic , heading southbound on Interstate 5 toward downtown San Diego . Overhead , a US Airways commercial airplane zoomed down toward San Diego International Airport , less than a mile west of the highway . And as the sun continued to make its descent across the far west side of the Pacific Ocean , the night lights of San Diego 's downtown skyline began to flicker into an evening glow . <p> Inside the fairly clean two-year-old Altima was dead silence . The driver was not in the mood for music at the moment ; too much else was on his mind . <p> He checked the clock on the dashboard for the fifth time to make sure he was still on schedule for his date at Hooters on Fourth Avenue . He was n't particularly in the mood for flirty young women serving drinks , burgers , chicken wings , and fries in skimpy orange shorts with white tank tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued on his way . <p> Exiting the highway on Second Avenue , the black Altima traveled southbound toward Horton Plaza , a downtown shopping center with a multilevel parking garage . When he arrived at the garage entrance , the driver stopped and rolled down his window to receive a ticket at the gate . He then accelerated past the rows of parked cars to find an open space . <p> Once he had found a parking spot on the third level of the garage , the driver checked the time for a final countdown . It was 8:43 pm . <p> " Right on time , " he mumbled . He climbed out of the car and straightened out his button-up shirt of light blue pinstripes . His pants were dark blue denim , and his shoes were soft brown leather . He had dressed down on purpose for a casual date . <p> At 8:47 , Ivan David strolled out of the parking garage exit . He was a light brown black man of medium build and medium height , with light brown hair and multicolored eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color from blue to light brown to green . <p> He looked around for a second to peruse his surroundings and sniff the downtown air . The nighttime temperature was at seventy degrees . Perfect . As soon he stepped out into the street to cross it , a yellow Ferrari Spider raced around the corner from his left and forced him to freeze . <p> Shit ! Do I move forward or backward ? Ivan asked himself . He had already made it halfway across the street . Move back , he decided . <p> As soon as he stepped out of the way , the yellow Ferrari sped past him with a California license plate that read TOO SLOW . <p> Ivan got the message and grinned . " Maybe I am , " he grunted before continuing across . <p> Hooters was two blocks away . Ivan proceeded to enjoy his evening stroll past the young and old couples who walked in and out of the restaurants that populated San Diego 's downtown strip . <p> " I 'll have a glass of Chardonnay , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CafT . His young-as-a-daughter date sat across their small table with a controlled smile . <p> Ivan looked into her calculating green eyes and wondered whether she loved her older man or his older money . <p> The dirty-blond beauty looked up at him momentarily , as if to read his skepticism . Then she looked away , unconcerned by it . <p> Ivan chuckled to himself as he passed them by , outside the waisthigh black iron gate that separated their table from the sidewalk . All he could think about was the numbers game : a fifty-two-year-old man , earning a mid to high six figures , and a twenty-eight-year-old date , earning a low five figures . <p> " I got ta stop thinking like an accountant , " he reminded himself as he walked . <p> When he arrived at Hooters and stepped inside , he blinked and readjusted his eyes . Damn . The bright orange was enough to blind a man . <p> " Hey , Ivan , over here . " <p> He turned to his left and spotted Catherine Boone , an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . She wore a lime-green dress , full of cleavage and curves , with matching lime-green heels . Her hair was shoulder length and straight , ideal for no-nonsense business . Her medium brown skin remained flawless . <p> As she stood up from her chair and table to greet him with an open hug , Ivan could see and feel that she had put on a good ten to twenty pounds of maturity . <p> " Whoa , you 're filling out a little bit , " he told her . <p> She smiled . " And ? " <p> He hesitated . " And , what ? " <p> " And , what does that mean ? " <p> Women were finicky about their appearance . So Ivan remained coy . <p> " I do n't know . You tell me , " he responded . <p> Catherine broke away . " Ivan , is it a good thing or a bad thing ? Because I like my new weight . I always thought I was too skinny in college . " <p> " You thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so ? " <p> Catherine sat back down . Ivan sat in the chair across the table from her . <p> He shook his head and answered , " No , not really . Your weight was always fine to me . " <p> Catherine grinned at him . " It 's good to see that you 're still the same Ivan . You 're as vague and as noncommittal as ever . And no new girlfriend yet , right ? " <p> Ivan smiled back . " I like keeping my concentration . " <p> Catherine grinned even harder . " Are we that bad , Ivan ? I mean , really ? " <p> She got all serious and stopped smiling . She wanted a sincere answer from him . A Hooters waitress broke them out of their groove before Ivan could grant her wish . <p> " Welcome to Hooters , my name is Claudia . " She immediately wrote her name down on a Hooters napkin in front of them . She was a breezy brunette in the bright white and orange uniform . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hooters menu sat out in front of them on the tabletop . <p> Ivan frowned and squinted his eyes . " Ahh ... I really did n't get a chance to look at the menu yet . " <p> " I 'll have a beer and some fries , " Catherine ordered overtop of him . <p> " Okay , " the brunette perked . She wrote it down on her order pad . Then she looked back at Ivan . " I 'll be right back in a minute , " she promised him . <p> Ivan nodded . " All right . " <p> As soon as the waitress left them , Catherine changed her tone and reached her gentle hands across the table to place over Ivan 's . " I 'm sorry to hear about your mother , " she told him . She had compassion in her dark brown eyes . She had heard about his mother 's funeral in Los Angeles through mutual friends . But her apology caught Ivan off guard . He froze for a second and daydreamed in her direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grunted , " It was gon na happen sooner or later . " He looked back into her eyes to finish his statement . " When you got any form of cancer , you 're fighting it to win or fighting it to lose . " <p> Catherine squeezed his hands tighter . " I know how much she meant to you . " <p> " Yeah , " Ivan grumbled . Then he forced himself to perk up . He said , " But the good thing she told me was to go ahead and live my life now , you know . I mean , I had been holding on for so long ... " <p> " I know , " Catherine responded . She remembered it through their college years . Ivan 's mother had begged him several times each semester to stay away from home in South Central L.A. to finish his schooling in San Diego . She knew that her illness would be too much of a strain on him at home . And when he was offered an accounting job at the firm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to take it and stay there . <p> Now Ivan felt guilty about everything . Although returning home may not have changed the end result , he would have at least been able to see his mother more before she was confined to her deathbed . <p> Finally , he pulled his hands away from Catherine at the table . <p> " Look , we 're not here to talk about that . So , what 's up with this new job you got ? " he asked her , changing the subject . <p> Catherine nodded and followed his lead . She wanted to make sure she got her empathy out of the way early . She had other plans for them that evening . <p> " Well , I may be moving back to the San Diego area if everything goes right , " she told him . She was originally from Sacramento . She said , " I had my interview this morning in Oceanside , but I made sure they put me up in a downtown San Diego hotel instead of all the way out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my way when I want it . " <p> Ivan sat back in his chair and smiled . " Yeah , I know it already . " <p> Catherine was a whiner , beggar , wheeler-dealer , or whatever else it took to get her way . She had worked her magic all throughout college as a business management major . And she was always in the middle of things . <p> Before she could get another word out , her conversation with Ivan was interrupted again . <p> " Hey , Ivan David . What 's going on , man ? " <p> Ivan turned to his right and looked up . He 'd recognize the Spanish-American accent with the rapid-fire tongue anywhere . It was Emilio Alvarez , an excitable rookie shortstop for the San Diego Padres . <p> " Hey , what 's going on , E.A. ? " Ivan addressed him with an outstretched hand . <p> They had met a few months ago at the accounting firm offices . Emilio was a new Hutch &amp; Mitchell client of Dominican descent from Texas . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A happy-faced date stood attached to his right arm . She was as light as Ivan , with straight brown hair , and was Mexican . <p> " Hey , you tell me , I.D. , " Emilio responded . He had to pull his date loose to shake Ivan 's hand with his right . <p> Ivan joked , " You 're out here just walking around with no bodyguards ? You could get mobbed . " <p> Emilio frowned . " Mobbed ? Man , I 'm just a young rookie trying to make a good name for myself . Nobody really knows me yet . " <p> As soon as he said it , the Hooters waitresses began to smile all around him . <p> " We know who you are , E.A. , " Claudia teased him . She spotted the rookie baseball player as soon as he walked in . She returned to the table with Catherine 's mug of beer and set it down in front of her . <p> Once Claudia spoke to Emilio , a few of the other waitresses breezed by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bold blonde flirted , and laughed . <p> Emilio 's date did n't look too pleased about that statement . But at least the blonde did n't stick around long . <p> Emilio laughed it all off . He said , " Hey , Ivan , you know we have a big party down here tonight . You guys should come hang out with us . Big Deke is throwing it . So we 're gon na grab something to eat on Fifth Ave. , then I can get you guys in VIP as my guests . " <p> Catherine listened as she sipped from her mug of beer . She immediately shook her head before Ivan could respond to him . <p> Ivan caught her response to the invitation and agreed to turn it down . <p> " Maybe another night , man . We 're just old friends over here catching up . But thanks for inviting us . " <p> " Oh , no problem . Anytime , " Emilio told him . <p> " Make sure you give me and my girls a few autographs before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Emilio looked confused . " Ahhh ... okay . " <p> His date said nothing the whole time , but her face said everything . She was just getting to know Emilio and had no idea how to respond to anything around them yet . <p> " Hey , rookie ! What are you doing in here ? " someone yelled from the doorway . The place was so bright that anyone could look straight through the glass windows and see everyone inside , just as Emilio had done to spot Ivan . <p> Ivan looked up again and recognized " Butch " Clayborne , a third baseman in his fifth year with the Padres . Butch had just signed a new multimillion-dollar contract earlier that year . He was a big , strong black man with two women : one white and one black . They were both proud to be his giddy companions for the night . And once the waitresses spotted Clayborne yelling through the doorway , several of them lost their cool . <p> " Oh , my God ! Butch , are you coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the double-talk of excitement . <p> He waved them off . " Nah , we do n't have time for that . Maybe another time . " <p> His two dates were already on their way in before he grabbed them back out . <p> " Hey , come on , let 's go , " he told them . Then he yelled back at Emilio , " Let 's go , rookie ! " <p> The two women stumbled back out to join him awkwardly . <p> " Damn , my heel , " the black companion complained at the door . <p> The white companion laughed at her . In a flash , they were out of the doorway and headed up the street for Fifth Avenue . <p> Emilio looked back at Ivan and shook his head with a grin . " You see what I mean ? I 'm just a rookie this year . I got a long way to go to get to where he 's at . I 'm just lucky he 's taking me under his wing . " <p> When Emilio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its normal chatter . The surprise visit from the Padres ' baseball players had added a spark of insanity to the place . But as quickly as they had entered , they were gone . <p> " So , how do you know Emilio ? " Claudia asked Ivan at the table . She had yet to receive an order from him . And she could see that the Padres rookie had a lot of respect for him . He had made it his personal mission to walk inside and say hi . He even invited Ivan and his date to a Padres party . <p> Ivan was still confused by all of it . " Ahh ... " <p> Was it any of her business how he knew Emilio ? How was he to respond to that ? <p> Catherine was still shaking her head across the table with her beer . Things were getting a bit out of hand , from what she could see . Everyone was losing their focus . <p> She asked the waitress , " Are my french fries on the way out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . <p> " Oh , yeah , let me go get those for you . " <p> When the waitress left them alone again , Catherine said , " Now , that was just crazy . Did you see how they started to act in here ? They act as if they never saw a baseball player before . " <p> Ivan smiled it off . " Yeah , but Butch Clayborne is more than just a regular player . He 's one of their bona fide stars now . " <p> The hype was no big deal to Ivan . He had been around plenty of wealthy and famous people . It was part of his job to go out and find new clients who had money . And they were all human . But what he did n't understand was why Catherine wanted to meet him at Hooters in the first place . They would never have any privacy there . <p> " You wan na go somewhere else ? " he asked her . <p> Catherine 's dress code surely did n't fit Hooters . Her lime-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath and calmed her nerves . She asked him , " How do you think my body compares to theirs ? " <p> Ivan stared across the table to make sure that he had heard her right . <p> " What ? " <p> " You heard me . How does my body compare to theirs ? " <p> She bobbed her head to the left in reference to the Hooters waitresses , who were scampering around the tables , filling orders , and cleaning up . <p> Ivan could n't believe it . He shook his head and smiled . He said , " So that 's why you wanted to meet me here , to do a body check against Hooters waitresses ? Are you kidding me ? " He was halfway laughing . He said , " If you really wan na do a body check , then let 's go to this Padres party and do it for real . I mean , come on , none of these girls wan na wear the stuff they have to wear in here . It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " I have my reasons . " <p> Ivan blew it off . " Anyway ... next question . " <p> It was no competition in his book . He was embarrassed to even look at the waitresses . And Catherine was pleased to know it . <p> " Thank you , " she told him . A nod of confidence meant the world to a woman . <p> By the time they had left the place , it was well after ten o'clock , and Catherine was good and tipsy . It became obvious that Ivan would need to help her walk to wherever they were off to next . <p> " So , what hotel they got you up in ? " he asked her . <p> Catherine was secure in his arms as they walked down Fourth Avenue . <p> " We 're almost there , " she told him . " And it 's a surprise . " <p> As they walked , a white stretch Hummer passed them by in the street and turned left down Fifth Avenue . <p> Catherine watched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's more of your baseball players , do n't you ? But if the Chargers were throwing a party , that would be a real party . I would have been interested in going to that . " <p> She added , " But it 's only , like , four or five black players on the whole Padres team . And I do n't count the Spanish guys . They 're not really down with us . But on the Chargers , more than half the team is black . " <p> Ivan only listened to her , amused by it all . He was slightly embarrassed by their night so far . What was her purpose for the evening ; to get drunk while comparing her body to Hooters girls ? That did n't make any sense . <p> The next thing he knew , Catherine had him walking her along Harbor Drive . <p> Ivan said , " I could have gotten my car if I would have known we were walking this far . " <p> " It 's not far , " she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street and we 're almost there . " <p> Ivan looked across the street in the direction where they were headed and spotted the twin towers of the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel . The towers were set on prime real estate , right off the San Diego Bay . It was an immaculate hotel from the outside alone . Ivan had no idea what it looked like on the inside . He had never had any reason to stay there . But he could imagine it . <p> " Oh , shit , do n't tell me they got you staying here , " he responded . <p> Catherine giggled and said , " Yup . I told you I can get what I want when I want it . I could n't wait to show you this . But ... " <p> She stopped herself momentarily before she mumbled , " You really wan na know why I took you through that whole Hooters thing ? " <p> Ivan did n't care . It was all trivial in his opinion . He decided to hear her out anyway . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked as he continued to help her walk . <p> She said , " Okay . When I was back home in Sacramento , I found out that my ex was crazy about a girl who worked there . And he actually left me for her . And I was like ... why ? " <p> Ivan started to chuckle and could n't help himself . Women ! Their insecurities were amazing . <p> Catherine promptly stopped them from walking . " I do n't see why that 's so funny , Ivan . My feelings were very hurt by that . Very hurt , " she told him . <p> " I 'm college educated . He 's college educated . I 'm a professional . He 's a professional . I 'm good looking . He 's good looking . And still , he picked a Hooters girl over me ? Why ? " <p> Ivan said , " Trust me , Catherine , it 's not about the restaurant , it 's all about the girl . " <p> She said , " But why do guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , it 's so tasteless . " <p> Ivan did n't feel like dealing with any of that . It was all meaningless . He thought more about seeing what the inside of the hotel looked like . So he ignored her question . <p> As they neared the front entrance , Catherine made sure to straighten herself up to walk in on her own . She did n't want the hotel staff and guests to consider her tasteless . <p> " Good to have you back this evening , " the uniformed valet greeted Catherine from the hotel drive-through . <p> " Thank you , " Catherine told him . <p> Ivan only nodded to him . They then nodded to the uniformed bellman as they entered the grand lobby . <p> For Ivan , a modest penny-pincher from South Central L.A. , the Manchester Grand Hyatt was immaculate . Top-of-the-line hotels allowed the imagination to run wild , with marble floors , rich carpet , giant chandeliers , crown molding , artwork , candles , exotic wood , interior plants , soft music , and tall ceilings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-star hotel and an off-the-road inn was like the difference between heaven and hell . <p> " They actually put you in here just for an interview ? " Ivan asked as they wandered through the lobby . " Which building are you in ? " <p> " The Seaport . " She grabbed him by the hand to lead him in the right direction . She said , " It has the better view . And it 's the newer building . " <p> As they strolled toward the Seaport building elevators , Ivan looked more like an amazed gawker than a guest . <p> Catherine read his wide , colorful eyes taking it all in . She yanked his arm for a dose of reality . " Come on , you know they 're getting corporate rates . They 're not paying what we would have to pay for this . They never do . So I told myself , ' Take advantage of it from the company now . Because I may not get another chance to . ' " <p> Ivan nodded and agreed with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> When they stepped into the elevator , another display of first-grade hotel quality , Ivan was inspired enough to go for broke . <p> He said , " Hell , why not just stay up in here for a night or two like it 's a vacation ? You only live once , right ? I got a thousand dollars in the bank for a vacation , do n't you ? " <p> Catherine looked at her old college man as if she no longer recognized him . <p> " What , and this coming from the cheapest man I knew on San Diego State 's campus ? " She said , " I remember you used to sneak out of line with your food at the cafeteria to save six dollars . " <p> Ivan laughed hard . He said , " That 's when I was holding down the fort . I had to do what I had to do . I was working a full-time job , going to school , and still sending money back home to my mom . But ... like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt guilty even saying it . He could hardly get the words out of his mouth . But he did . The reality of the hotel had smacked him in the face with a cold hard hand of what he had been missing all of his life , an opportunity for luxury . <p> DINNNGGG ! <p> The elevator doors opened to the hallway on the fourteenth floor . <p> " Here we are . " Catherine spoke up with a chuckle . " Wait till you see the view I have from the room . " <p> Ivan said , " We should have had our dinner date over here . They got restaurants downstairs , do n't they ? " <p> Catherine looked at him , amused . " And you would have paid the prices for the restaurants in this hotel ? And then turned around and tipped the waiters ? Because this is not fries and chicken and burgers over here . " <p> Ivan smiled broadly , knowing better . He said , " You would have paid for it . Corporate rates . They got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . " <p> " Yeah , and I 'm sure they 're looking to see exactly how expensive I can be , too , " she commented . " I do n't have this job yet , and I 'm not a fool like that . So if we need to bring Chinese takeout back to this hotel , then that 's what we 'll do . " <p> They shared a laugh as they reached the room . As soon as they walked into the king-sized suite , Ivan walked straight over to the window view of the bay and just stood there . He could see clear across to Coronado Island to his left , or view the boats , piers , smaller islands , and seafood restaurants to his right . <p> " They call this the corner room , " Catherine told him . <p> Ivan looked out at a lone boat in the middle of the bay and wondered if it was the yacht of a rich man out on a private date . What a life that would be . He stood there stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined him at the window . " It 's beautiful , is n't it ? The windows even open up so you can smell the air . " <p> She unlatched the large window and pushed it open for him to see . But Ivan remained speechless . The calculations were all running through his mind again as he idled there at the window . How could he afford to remain there at the hotel ? How could he afford his own boat , property , leisure , travel , and custom designs ? <p> Catherine moved to wrap herself within Ivan 's arms , as if they were still an on-fire college couple . <p> " What are you thinking about ? " she asked him . <p> Ivan heard her question in his mind and ran with it . Problem was , he was thinking about too many things at once . So he settled on the most recent idea as his mind slowed down and came to a rest to answer her . <p> " I 'm thinking about that Padres party . " He wondered what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with . Maybe Emilio would introduce him to more of the major players on the team . <p> Catherine broke away , irritated by his answer . How could he still be thinking about a party when he had her all alone in a five-star hotel bedroom , with a dynamite view , wearing a dynamite dress , and horny to boot with alcohol in her system ? What the hell was wrong with him ? <p> " You really wan na go to that party that much , Ivan ? " she snapped at him . <p> Ivan was surprised by her outburst . He had n't been paying her physical attractions much attention . He 'd had a lot on his mind , with the thoughts of his mother passing away , before they had even met up that night . Now he had even more on his mind concerning how he planned to live out the rest of his life . <p> " I mean , I do n't have to go to this party , but ... " <p> He stopped and thought about his dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old news , and that the party seemed more interesting to him at the moment ? He wanted to get up close and personal with the people who could really afford to live . And he had been invited to do so . <p> Catherine looked into Ivan 's eyes , flickering in the moonlight from the window , and she decided to do something desperate to pique his interest . She wanted him to sleep over that night and give her his full attention without any distractions . So she massaged his crotch , kicked off her heels , and sank to her knees in front of him at the window . <p> She looked up and asked him , " Would this be your fantasy ? " <p> Ivan could not deny that her spontaneous exuberance excited him . His manhood would surely respond to a blow job . But then he thought about their past . Catherine was a credit card woman . Whatever you spent with her , you would be forced to pay back later , and with interest . So Ivan shook his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nah , I 'm not really ... " <p> He stopped and looked into Catherine 's determined face . Ivan knew who she was , and there were no surprises to her . <p> " I just know how you are , " he concluded . " And I 'm not trying to go there . " <p> She ignored him and reached to unzip his pants zipper anyway . <p> Ivan stepped farther away and continued to deny her . He even put his hands in front of his pants to protect himself . " Yo  --  " <p> Catherine was incensed . " Just let me do what I want to do , Ivan . It may be my fantasy . And I promise not to hold you to anything . " <p> She was saying this from her knees , and the irony did not pass Ivan by . So he continued to shake his head . <p> " Look at this , Cat , " he commented , referring to her college nickname . " This ai n't a good picture , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Catherine heard him out , took a deep breath , and climbed back to her feet . Then she could n't even face him . <p> She sat on the edge of the king-sized bed and mumbled with her head down , " You 're still the same old Ivan ... wo n't break for nobody . " <p> Ivan did n't respond . But she was right . He was a man who stuck by his principles . <p> She added , " I was hoping that you had changed a little bit . " <p> He did n't have a response to that , either . The truth was , he had n't changed . He was still as strong willed as ever . <p> After another minute , the silence of the room increased the awkwardness for both of them . <p> Catherine finally decided to let the fish off the hook and send him back into the water . <p> " Well ... if you wan na go to that party so much ... " <p> Ivan jumped at his chance to leave with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " He knew he had to at least make his exit sound good . <p> Catherine looked at him and asked , " What , after the party ? No . " She did n't care about a consolation prize . She had lost him . <p> " I mean , just to call you up and make sure everything is all right , " he told her . <p> " Ivan , I 'm a grown fucking woman , okay ? " she snapped at him . " So you go do what you need to do and do n't worry about me . " <p> Ouch ! He should have quit while he was ahead . Now he felt awkward again . Instead of saying anything else , he nodded and headed for the door . <p> " I 'll call you , " he said on the way out . <p> When the door closed behind him , Catherine took another deep breath and dropped her head even lower . All of her plans were out the window , falling fourteen stories down . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have been better off at the fucking Days Inn ... and could have saved them a bunch of money . " <p> Ivan was out of the hotel in a flash to hustle his way back to the action on Fifth Avenue . <p> " You 're leaving us already ? " It was the same valet who had greeted Catherine when she and Ivan had entered the hotel . <p> Ivan faced him and answered , " I 'll be back . " He added , " Not tonight , but I 'll be back , though , for sure . " He planned on it . Then he laughed as he made his way back up Harbor Drive . <p> He felt like a college student again , rushing to make his way to the clubs . And on a Thursday night , he was sure that the Padres party would have few competitors . <p> When he arrived back in the Gaslamp Quarter , what San Diego referred to as its main restaurant and nightclub district , the stretch limos , luxury sedans , and exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Market Street Hotel told him exactly where the party was . <p> The long line along the outside wall of the hotel made the party look more like a Saturday . But on a Thursday night , only the able people partied : those who did n't have to clock in in the morning , those who did n't care , and those who planned to work it all out . <p> Ivan fit the last group . He would definitely make it to work in the morning . He would just have less sleep to count on . But he was too curious that evening to let the opportunity of the Padres party pass by . <p> " Come on , just let us in , it 's only the two of us , " a pair of long-legged twins , wearing revealing dresses , begged the doormen at the front . The time was fast approaching midnight . <p> " In a minute , " the husky doorman responded to them . He stretched out his thick right arm in front of them , wearing the same professional black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . Their orchestrated job looked like the set of a Men in Black movie . It was a doorman 's extra duty to deal with the begging types . So Ivan studied the scene to see how he would plead his own case . He definitely was n't planning on walking to the back of the long line and paying . However , he figured he at least needed to know what the cost would be . <p> " Hey , what 's the price to get in ? " <p> The doormen looked him up and down before anyone answered . Who was he ? Was he dressed correctly ? Was he coming in ? Or was he staying out ? <p> Once they all established that Ivan David was a nobody , they gave him the price of general admission . <p> " Cover charge is twenty-five dollars . The line is that way , " one of the men piped up to him , and pointed . They continued to guard the entrance without missing a beat . <p> All right , here I go , Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information . He noticed that they marked off a guest list held just inside the doorway . <p> I hope Emilio has a list of names , he thought . From there , he would have to work it out himself . <p> " Actually , I 'm here as a guest of Emilio Alvarez , the rookie shortstop . Tell him Ivan David is here . " <p> Ivan spoke with such presence and authority that the two brownhaired twins turned to look him over for themselves . A few of the other anxious line-waiters looked in Ivan 's direction as well . Who the hell was he ? <p> " What 's your name again ? " the first doorman asked him . He continued to hold the twins at bay in front of him . <p> " Ivan David . " <p> " Ivan David ? " the doorman repeated in confusion . " You got two first names ? " <p> Ivan grinned . " Yeah . " <p> The doorman cracked his first smile . " Okay . Hey , check the list for Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name would n't be on the list . He wished he had told Emilio to look out for him just in case he swung past the party later . But he planned to argue his point to the doormen anyway . All he needed was someone to go inside and find E.A. for him . <p> As he waited there on the sidewalk for the inevitable , the valet staff sprinted to the curb , where another stretch limo was pulling up . <p> The crowd got excited in anticipation . Even Ivan watched to see who it was . Was Big Deke Walker , the superstar slugger , at the party yet ? He was never known to attend a party early . <p> But when the valet guys opened the limo doors and let out its passengers , there were only sexy women inside . They climbed out one at a time and stood on the sidewalk until the last one had joined them . There were seven of them in all , the perfect number to pack inside their stretch limo . And they were all of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exotic mixtures in between . <p> Were they a cheerleading squad or models ? No one was sure until their leader stepped out last and was immediately recognized by the doormen . <p> " Lucina , " one of the doormen said to her . <p> " Hey , Matt , how 's it going ? " she addressed him with a light hand to his arm . <p> " You know the party do n't get started until you arrive , " he teased her . <p> " Stop it , " she told him , and laughed . " Then again , do n't stop , " she teased . <p> Ivan heard a slight accent in her voice , but it did n't sound Mexican or Filipina . It had more of a Mediterranean swagger to it . Maybe Italian or Greek . <p> " That 's Lucina Gallo , " he overheard one the twins comment from behind him . <p> Ivan stared at this Lucina Gallo woman up close and was impressed with her immediately . She wore a thin silky dress of a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid colors of the other girls . Her sparkling purse , necklace , bracelet , watch , anklet , and heels all glittered in the night , like a live advertisement for a glamorous fashion magazine . And her height mixed in well with the others ' . She was not the tallest or the shortest , but she definitely had the most presence . She looked no older than he was , twenty-eight . However , Ivan only gave her that because she was in a position of authority . Otherwise , she looked a spoiled twenty-two , a rich man 's college-aged daughter . <p> Then she looked in Ivan 's direction to survey the crowd . When she did , he noticed that her eyes twinkled with a multicolored hue of their own . Her eyes were in contrast with her moody , olive-toned skin and thick , dark , two-toned brown hair . <p> Ivan was frozen stiff just from looking at her . <p> Damn , she bad ! <p> Lucina looked right through him and into the crowd behind him as if he were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice line , " she said to herself with a nod . Then she turned back to her girls . " Let 's go inside . " <p> Ivan watched them all walk into the hotel party past the doormen , and he missed them already , especially Lucina . As he continued to stand there on the sidewalk , he felt as cold as a lone man at the North Pole . <p> " Shit , " he mumbled to himself . He thought again about what it would take to become an insider with the movers and shakers of San Diego . The doormen then snapped him out of his daydream . <p> " There 's no Ivan David on the list . " <p> Ivan said , " Well , can one of you go get Emilio and let him know that I 'm here ? " <p> The lead doorman shook his head . " That 's not our job . Call him up on his cell phone . " He was finally ready to let the twins in . " Okay , you can go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay their twenty-five dollars inside the doorway , and he realized the only way he was getting into the party free was if Emilio happened to walk outside for some reason . But why would he do that in the middle of a jam-packed party ? <p> Ivan looked to the back of the line again . It had grown longer since the last time he looked . The doormen did n't pay him any more attention . His case was closed . They had jobs to do . So Ivan shook it off and accepted his defeat . <p> Let me get the hell out of here , he told himself . He figured that going through too much hassle to get in would kill his excitement at being there . <p> Just as he began to walk away , the lead doorman called out his name again in jest . " All right , Ivan David . You make sure you make that list next time . " <p> A few of the other doormen laughed , but Ivan did n't find it funny . The joke registered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way . <p> " All right . You can count on that . " <p> Copyright 2008 by Omar Tyree Incorporated <br> Continues ...
