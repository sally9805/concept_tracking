9/11 // SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 , WAS ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC dates of our lifetimes . It took , and shattered , the lives of thousands of innocent people . It robbed the Western world of its sense of freedom and security . For me , it was a nightmare of grief and horror-one that will imprison me and my three daughters for the rest of our lives . // And yet 9/11 began as a lovely Indian summer day . I was enjoying a leisurely drive from Lausanne to Geneva with my eldest daughter , Wafah , when one of my closest friends , who was working in New York , called me on my cell phone . // " Something terrible just happened , " he told me , his voice urgent , from his office in Manhattan . " I 'm watching the news . It 's incredible : A plane hit one of the towers of the World Trade Center . " And then , his voice rising further , he yelled , " Wait a minute-there 's another plane-it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he was screaming now- " it hit the second tower ! " // As he described the second hit , something in me snapped . This was no freak accident . This had to be a deliberately plotted attack , on a country I had always loved and looked on as my second home . I froze . Then waves of horror crashed over me as I realized that somewhere at the bottom of this lay the shadow of my brother-in-law : Osama Bin Laden . // Beside me in the car , my daughter Wafah was yelling , " What ? What happened ? " I was in shock . I managed to force out a few words . Wafah lived in New York . She had just graduated from Columbia Law School , and had spent the summer with me in Switzerland . She was planning to head back to her New York apartment in four days ' time . Now she was in tears , frantically punching in numbers on her cell phone , trying to reach all her friends . // My first instinct was to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to hear her voice . She had already heard about the double attack in New York , and she told me a third plane had just hit the Pentagon . The world was spinning off its axis : I could feel it . // I raced to the high school attended by my youngest daughter , Noor . The look of shock in her eyes told me she already knew . The blood had drained from her face . // We rushed home to meet my middle girl , Najia , as she returned from college . She , too , was devastated . Like many millions of other people around the world , the children and I watched CNN , mesmerized , alternately weeping and phoning everyone we knew . // As the hours passed , my worst fear came true . One man 's face and name was on every news bulletin : Osama Bin Laden . My daughters ' uncle . A man whose name they shared , but whom they had never met , and whose values were totally foreign to them . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of our lives , forever . // OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF MY husband , Yeslam . He is one of many brothers , and I knew him only distantly , when I lived in Saudi Arabia , years ago . At the time , Osama was a young man , but he always had a commanding presence . Osama was tall , and stern , and his fierce piety was intimidating , even to the more religious members of his family . // During the years that I lived among the Bin Laden family in Saudi Arabia , Osama came to exemplify everything that repelled me in that opaque and harsh country : the unbending dogma that ruled all our lives , the arrogance and pridefulness of the Saudis , and their lack of compassion for people who did n't share their beliefs . That contempt for outsiders , and unyielding orthodoxy , spurred me on to a fourteen-year struggle to give my children a life of freedom . // In my struggle to sever our ties to Saudi Arabia , I began amassing information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in might and notoriety , spiraling deeper into murderous rage against the United States from his redoubt in Afghanistan . // Osama was a warlord , who assisted the Afghan rebels in their fight against the Soviet occupation of their country . When the Soviets left , Osama returned home , to Saudi Arabia . For many he was already a hero . // When Iraq invaded Kuwait , in 1990 , Osama was outraged at the idea that U.S. forces might use Saudi Arabia as a base . He offered Saudi King Fahd the use of his Afghan warriors to fight Saddam Hussein . Some of the more religious princes thought Osama 's ideas had merit , but King Fahd refused . // Osama began making incendiary statements against the corruption and moral bankruptcy of the Saudi ruling family , and the Americans who were defending them . Finally , Osama was forced to leave his country , and take refuge in Sudan , where his compound of armed men was surrounded by sentries in tanks . Then he moved back to Afghanistan . // In those days , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms with Yeslam , who kept me up-to-date on the evolution in Saudi Arabia and the Bin Laden family news-including Osama 's whereabouts . Yeslam told me that Osama 's power was growing , despite his exile . Osama , he said , was under the protection of conservative members of the Saudi royal family . // In 1996 , when a truck bomb blasted the Khobar Towers living quarters of American forces posted in Dahran , in eastern Saudi Arabia , Osama was mentioned as a possible culprit . I was dumbstruck , yet I knew it could be true . Who else could possibly have at his disposal enough explosives in a country so highly controlled ? Osama was a warrior , a zealot , and a member of the family that jointly owned the Bin Laden Organization-the wealthiest and most powerful construction company in Saudi Arabia . I knew of Osama 's fiercely extreme opinions , and deep down I felt that he was capable of a terrible , blind violence . // As attack followed attack , I read everything I could lay my hands on about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news broke of the attack on Afghan fighter Ahmed Shah Massoud , I realized it had to be Osama 's doing . I walked over to the television , with a sick feeling . " This is Osama . He is getting ready for something truly awful . " " Oh Carmen , you 're obsessed , " scoffed a friend of mine . But I knew . // I wish I had been wrong . // It never occurred to me that Osama was plotting an assault on the heart of New York . I thought perhaps it would be an embassy-that would have been bad enough . But when the World Trade Center went down in flames just two days after Massoud 's death , it hit me again . The sick feeling in my stomach . The fear . // Now I know that it will never go away again . // In the days that followed the attack on the World Trade Center , our lives revolved around the TV news bulletins . The toll of victims kept rising , as the dust settled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched people searching for the missing , clutching old snapshots in their hands . Bereaved relatives told reporters about the last phone messages left on their answering machines before their loved ones died . There were those awful photographs of people jumping . I kept thinking , " What if Wafah had been there ? " I felt so very deeply for those mothers , for those children . // My three girls were distraught with grief and bewilderment . Noor , the girl who just one year earlier had brought an American flag home from South Carolina to stick on her bedroom wall , sank into despondency . She sobbed , " Mom , New York will never be the same . " Fortunately , she never became the target of hostility from her classmates : Her pro-American cheerleading had made her the subject of friendly teasing for years , so all her friends realized how truly hurt my little girl was . // We hardly left the house . Reporters called constantly : I was the only Bin Laden in Europe with a listed phone number . Friends called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were rapidly becoming personae non grata . The Bin Laden name frightened even the hardiest professionals . A new law firm refused to take my divorce case : I suddenly found myself without a lawyer . // Of all of us , it was Najia who focused most on the suffering of the World Trade Center 's victims . She could n't bear to watch TV most of the time . Her name was becoming public currency : This was particularly hard to bear for such a private person . Najia is perhaps the most discreet of all my children . She does n't display her emotions easily , but I could see she was stricken . // The terrible irony was that we identified , and grieved , with the victims , while the outside world saw us as aggressors . We were trapped in a Kafkaesque situation-particularly Wafah . After four years of law school , Wafah 's life was in New York . Her apartment was just blocks from the World Trade Center . She talked night and day about her friends there ; she felt she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly back immediately . // Then one newspaper reported that Wafah had been tipped off : She had , they said , fled New York just days before the attack . This was untrue . Wafah had been with me , in Switzerland , since June . But other papers picked up the story . They said Wafah had known in advance about the attack , and had done nothing to protect the people and the home that she loved . // A friend who was staying in Wafah 's New York apartment called : She had begun receiving death threats . It was an understandable reaction-how could strangers distinguish one Bin Laden from another ? // I felt I had no choice . I alone could defend my daughters . I issued a statement saying that my three girls and I had had no connection whatsoever with this evil , barbaric attack on America , a country we loved and whose values we shared and admired . I went on TV . I wrote to the newspapers to express our sorrow . My long battle to free myself and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence I could offer for our innocence : that , and our goodwill , and the pain we felt for Osama 's victims . // I had so longed for an end to my bitter fight against the Bin Ladens and their country . But now I faced a whole new struggle . I would have to shepherd my children through the anguish they felt as their name became synonymous with evil , infamy , and death . // My private life had become a public story . // IRONICALLY , IT WAS ONLY AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 THAT my fourteen-year fight for freedom from Saudi Arabia made sense to the people around me . Before that , I think no one truly understood what was at stake-not the courts , not the judge , not even my friends . Even in my own country , Switzerland , I was perceived , more or less , as just another woman embroiled in a nasty international divorce . // But I always knew that my fight went far deeper than that . I was fighting to gain freedom from one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a merciless culture that denied their most basic rights . In Saudi Arabia they could not even walk alone in the street , let alone choose the path of their own lives . I fought to free them from the hard-core fundamentalist values of Saudi Arabian society , and its contempt for the tolerance and liberty of the West , which I have learned to value deeply . // I am afraid that even today , the West does not fully understand Saudi Arabia and its rigid value system . For nine years , I lived inside the powerful Bin Laden clan , with its close and complex links to the royal family . My daughters went to Saudi schools . I lived , to a great extent , the life of a Saudi woman . And over time , I learned and analyzed the mechanisms of that opaque society , and the harsh and bitter rules that it enforces on its daughters . // I could not stand quietly by while my little girls ' bright minds were extinguished . I could not teach them to submit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be branded as rebels because of the Western values that I taught them-despite all the punishment that might ensue . And were they to comply with Saudi society , I could not face the prospect that my daughters might grow up to become like the faceless , voiceless women I lived among . // Above all I could not watch my daughters be denied what I valued most : freedom of choice . I had to free them , and myself . // This is my story . //
