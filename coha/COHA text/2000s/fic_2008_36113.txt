They were both working their final shift at Blackjack Pizza that night , although nobody but the two of them realized it was that . Give them this much : they were talented secret-keepers . Patient planners . They 'd been planning it for a year , hiding their intentions in plain sight on paper , on videotape , over the Internet . In their junior year , one had written in the other 's yearbook , " God , I ca n't wait till they die . I can taste the blood now . " And the other had answered , " Killing enemies , blowing up stuff , killing cops ! My wrath will be godlike ! " <p> My wrath will be godlike : maybe that 's a clue . Maybe their ability to dupe everyone was their justification . If we could be fooled , then we were all fools ; they were , therefore , superior , chaos theirs to inflict . But I do n't know . I 'm just one more chaos theorist , as lost in the maze as everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 , four days before they opened fire . I 'd stayed after school for a parent conference and a union meeting and , in between , had called Maureen to tell her I 'd pick up takeout . Blackjack Pizza was between school and home . <p> It was early still . The Friday-night pizza rush had n't begun . He was at the register , elbows against the counter , talking to a girl in a hairdresser 's smock . Or not talking , pretty much . There was a cell phone on the counter , and he kept tapping it with his index finger to make it spin-kept looking at the revolving cell phone instead of at the girl . I remember wondering if I 'd just walked in on a lover 's spat . " I better get back , " the girl said . " See you tomorrow . " Her smock said " Great Clips , " which meant she worked at the salon next door-the place where Maureen went . <p> " Prom date ? " I asked him . The big event was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there , the kids would head back to school for the all-night post-prom party , which I 'd been tagged to help chaperone . <p> " I would n't go to that bogus prom , " he said . He called over his shoulder . " How 's his **27;884;TOOLONG coming ? " His cohort opened the oven door and peered in . Gave a thumbs-up . <p> " So tell me , " I said . " You guys been having any more of your famous Blackjack flour wars ? " <p> He gave me a half-smile . " You remember that ? " <p> " Sure . Best piece you wrote all term . " <p> He 'd been in my junior English class the year before . A grade-conscious concrete sequential , he was the kind of kid who was more comfortable memorizing vocab definitions and lines from Shakespeare than doing the creative stuff . Still , his paper about the Blackjack Pizza staff 's flour fights , which he 'd shaped as a spoof on war , was the liveliest thing he 'd written all term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should think about taking creative writing next year . " And he had . He was in Rhonda Baxter 's class . Rhonda did n't like him , though-said she found him condescending . She hated the way he rolled his eyes at other kids ' comments . Rhonda and I shared a free hour , and we often compared notes about the kids . I neither liked nor disliked him , particularly . He 'd asked me to write him a letter of recommendation once . Ca n't remember what for . What I do recall is sitting there , trying to think up something to say . <p> He rang up my sale . I handed him a twenty . " So what 's next year looking like ? " I asked . " You heard back from any of the schools you applied to ? " <p> " I 'm joining the Marines , " he said . <p> " Yeah ? Well , I heard they 're looking for a few good men . " He nodded , not smiling , and handed me my change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in hand . He 'd lost the boyish look I remembered from his freshman year . Now he was a lanky , beak-nosed adult , his hair tied back in a sorry-looking ponytail , his chin as prominent as Jay Leno 's . " So what 's your game plan for next year ? " I asked him . <p> " University of Arizona . " <p> " Sounds good , " I said . I gave a nod to the Red Sox cap he was wearing . " You follow the Sox ? " <p> " Somewhat . I just traded for Garciaparra in my fantasy league . " <p> " Good move , " I said . " I used to go to Sox games all the time when I was in college . Boston University . Fenway was five minutes away . " <p> " Cool , " he said . <p> " Maybe this is their year , huh ? " <p> " Maybe . " He did n't sound like he gave a shit either way . <p> He was in Rhonda 's creative writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room sputtering about him one day . " Read this , " she said . " Is this sick or what ? " He 'd written a two-page story about a mysterious avenger in a metal-studded black trench coat . As jocks and " college preps " leave a busy bar , he pulls pistols and explosives out of his duffel bag , wastes them , and walks away , smiling . " Do you think I should call his parents ? " Rhonda had asked . <p> I 'd shrugged . " A lot of the guys write this kind of crap . Too many video games , too much testosterone . I would n't worry about it . He probably just needs a girlfriend . " She had worried , though , enough to make that call . She 'd referred to the meeting , a week or so later , as " a waste of time . " <p> The door banged open ; five or six rowdy kids entered Blackjack . " Hey , I 'll see you later , " I said . <p> " Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make a good Marine . Clean-cut , conscientious , his ironed T-shirt tucked neatly into his wrinkle-free shorts . Give him a few years , I figured , and he 'd probably be officer material . <p> At dinner that night , Maureen suggested we go out to a movie , but I begged off , citing end-of-the-week exhaustion . She cleaned up , I fed the dogs , and we adjourned to our separate TVs . By ten o'clock , I was parked on my recliner , watching Homicide with the closed-caption activated , my belly full of pizza . There was a Newsweek opened on my lap for commercial breaks , a Pete 's Wicked ale resting against my crotch , and a Van Morrison CD reverberating inside my skull : Astral Weeks , a record that had been released in 1968 , the year I turned seventeen . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
