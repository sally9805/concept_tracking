Hissy Fit A Novel Chapter One If it had not been for my fiance 's alcoholic cousin Mookie I feel quite sure that my daddy would still be a member in good standing at the Oconee Hills Country Club . But Mookie ca n't drink hard liquor . She can drink beer and wine all day and all night and not bat an eyelash , but give her a mai-tai or , God forbid , a margarita , and you are asking for trouble . It was my rehearsal dinner , which the Jernigans were hosting , and I was the bride-to-be , so I do n't believe I should have been the one responsible for keeping a grown woman and mother of two away from the margarita machine , even if she was one of the bridesmaids . Nonetheless , I was the one standing there when Mookie went spinning out of control across the dance floor , and I was the one who got sprayed with a good six ounces of strawberry margarita . And across the front of my blue raw silk Tahari dress too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother-in-law-to-be . She of course had neatly sidestepped Mookie , leaving her own pale pink beaded gown spotless . " I told you not to have her in the wedding . You know how she gets . " " Keeley , " Mookie yelped , lunging at me with her half-empty glass . " I am sooooo sorry . Let me help you get cleaned up . " She proceeded to dump the rest of her drink down my back . " It 's fine , " I said , gritting my teeth . " Just a little spot . " Mookie 's mother , who is used to this kind of behavior , snatched her up by the arm and started dragging her toward the door so she would n't cause any more of a scene , and all the women closed ranks around me , dabbing and fussing until I wanted to scream . Actually , I 'd been wanting to scream for several weeks now . Enough ! Enough parties . Enough presents . Enough luncheons and teas , enough sappy wedding showers , enough family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.J. had had enough too . " Ca n't we just go somewhere and screw our brains out for a couple weeks , then come back and be normal ? " he 'd asked the night before the rehearsal dinner . It had been a busy week . I 'd already endured the " Sip ' n See Tea , " where everybody in the county came by my daddy 's house to paw over my wedding loot , and the bridesmaids ' luncheon where GiGi let it be known that she thought it was awful my mama had n't been invited to the wedding . As if I even knew where Mama had been living for the past twenty-some years . And that was just the solo stuff . That very night A.J. and I had suffered through the " His ' n Her Barbecue Shower " given by one of his former fraternity brothers . At the time he asked this question , A.J. was modeling the Hot Stuff ! barbecue apron and padded oven mitt , which had been a shower gift from his Aunt Norma . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he was n't wearing the mitt where his Aunt Norma had intended . I had A.J. backed into the corner with the barbecue tongs , and then one thing led to another , and pretty soon we were rolling around on the floor of his apartment , and my chef 's hat came off along with the rest of my clothes , and the next thing you know , A.J. was having one of his attacks . " Hee-upp ! Hee-upp . " His whole body arched backward . I pushed him away , not startled really . A.J. gets like that sometimes when he 's , uh , in the throes . " Breathe , baby , breathe , " I instructed , slithering out from under him . " No , " he managed , between hiccups . " Do n't stop , Keeley . " He tried to pull me back down . " Come on . I 'll be all right . " " Hee-upp ! Hee-upp ! Hee-upp . " His body jerked violently with each hiccup . I was afraid he 'd hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Not to mention that I do n't find fits of uncontrollable hiccups much of a turn-on . Not even when the hiccupper is the love of my life . I scrambled to my feet , ran to the sink , and filled a cup with water . " Come on , A.J. , " I said , helping him to his feet . " It 's better if you stand up . Come on , sugar , drink some water for Keeley . " " I ( hee ) do n't ( up ) want any damn hee-uppp ! water , " A.J. stuttered . But he took a sip anyway . " Another one , " I urged , rubbing his bare back . He caught my free hand and slid it down his belly . The man never stops trying . " No , now , " I said , giggling and moving away . He pulled me back toward him . I held out the cup . " Not until you drink all this water . " He frowned but started sipping . " Go slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing that works . " " I know what works , " he said , getting that look in his eye again . " Come back over here and rub on me again . " But I 'd picked up my clothes and was already hurrying into the bedroom to get dressed . " Hey ! " he called after me . " That was n't the deal . " I pushed the button on the doorknob . " I know , " I called through the locked door . " I tricked you . " By the time he found the key to the bedroom door I was just zipping my skirt . " Aw , Keeley , " he said , his lip thrust out in that adorable pout of his . " I wanted us to do it one more time tonight . " I tried to kiss the pout away , but he was n't having it . " A.J. , " I said , pushing his hands away from the button he was unfastening . " Now , really . The wedding 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting and a ton of stuff to do . I ca n't be staying over here fooling around with you all night . " " Come on , baby , " he whispered , sliding the zipper on my skirt down while pushing my skirt up toward my waist . " Once we 're married , it wo n't be as much fun as this . We 'll be all legal and stuff . " Hissy Fit
