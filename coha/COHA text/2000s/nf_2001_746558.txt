Section : LEGAL SERVICES DELIVERY While courts work to become more friendly to pro se litigants , the justice system struggles to address difficult issues raised by their presence <p> After working more than 20 years in a court clerk 's office , anyone would have a huge I've-heard-it-all file . But that did n't stop Florence Prushan from feeling a shiver during one of her routine presentations about the Ventura County , Calif. , Superior Court outreach program . The project is a leader in the movement to make the courts more user-friendly for the fast-growing numbers of litigants who do not have lawyers . <p> " One man told me his wife watches Judge Judy on television and gets all their information on the courts from her , " says Prushan , an assistant court executive in Ventura , near Los Angeles . " It has become very clear to me that the public does n't have a clue about what we do or why we do it . " <p> They might know more about Judge Judy 's lashing mix of ego and equity than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has n't stopped nonlawyers from flooding the courts in recent years as self-represented litigants . <p> There is a growing movement to make the courts more hospitable to people who , by do-it-yourself choice or penny-pinching necessity , come to the justice system as pro se litigants  --  a term few of them would recognize , which is just one obvious part of the problem . <p> While there is little statistical data on the increase of self-represented litigants and their impact on particular courts , the numbers are believed to be significant . The bulk of do-it-yourself representation tends to be in family matters , but it is also increasing in landlord-tenant , small claims and other areas . <p> The most noted empirical study was conducted in 1990 in the domestic relations court in Maricopa County , Ariz. , which includes Phoenix , with funding from the ABA . Research showed that at least one party was self-represented in more than 88 percent of the divorce cases , and in 52 percent of them both parties were on their own . Money Talks <p> One measure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Institute to study and deal with the problems faced by the bench , bar , clerks ' offices and litigants themselves . The SJI is a nonprofit corporation in Alexandria , Va. , created by Congress to offer grants and information to help state courts improve the justice system . <p> In 1992 the SJI for the first time invited proposals for grants to work on issues concerning self-represented litigants . Only a smattering of grants were sought and given the first few years . The numbers had swelled by 1998-2000 , when 15 of 64 grant requests were successful , totaling in excess of $1.2 million . <p> More than half of that was in the year 2000 alone  --  in large part triggered by the American Judicature Society 's November 1999 Conference on Unrepresented Litigants . That groundbreaking event brought together court representatives from 49 states and several territories . <p> " It has become a big issue for us  --  the scope of it  --  in terms of the number of proposals we 're getting now , " says David Tevelin , SJI executive director . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and for the courts and lawyers  --  abound on the Internet . The ABA Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services , for instance , offers a variety of links to Web sites on projects and pro se support , as well as citations for reports , articles and ethics opinions ( see **43;1237;TOOLONG ) . <p> Ventura County is even more direct , sending a 35-foot , custom-built Winnebago as a mobile self-help center to localities where the help is most needed . Fashioned on the popular bookmobile libraries and staffed by a lawyer , it offers a variety of aids and tools , from books and videos to Internet access and forms . <p> The U.S. Supreme Court found a constitutional right to represent oneself in court in the 1975 decision Faretta v. California . But the realities and logistics of exercising that right can be nightmarish . <p> Something so simple as help from court clerks in filling out forms often raises the most basic question : What exactly is the practice of law ? <p> Seemingly simple information such as filing deadlines may involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is not much help in the definitions courts have come up with for the practice of law . Even Arizona , which is in the forefront of the movement toward easy-to-use courts , employs logic remarkably similar to the late Justice Potter Stewart 's famous " I know it when I see it " definition of pornography . <p> " We believe it sufficient to state that those acts , whether performed in court or in the law office , which lawyers have customarily carried on from day to day through the centuries must constitute the ' practice of law , ' " stated the Arizona Supreme Court in State Bar of Arizona v. Arizona Land Title and Trust Co. ( 1961 ) . <p> Whatever practicing law might entail , when the untrained come to court by themselves expecting justice they often encounter a befuddling , unyielding phalanx of procedures and rules . When dealing with other governmental agencies they can make up for mistakes or come back again with the proper paperwork . But the courts do n't usually work that way , and people ask why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended information and assistance programs in the courts for pro se litigants as a means of " further building trust and confidence in the courts . " Impact on Lawyers <p> Critics say that some help for pro se litigants  --  from detailed guidance by court staffers to judges bending strict rules of evidence  --  undermines the core of the judicial system and damages the legal profession itself . There is the perception and the mixed message , they argue , that pro se litigants might have an unfair advantage over those who bring lawyers to court . <p> And some in the legal profession fear lawyers will lose business if those rules and procedures are bent or changed to accommodate pro se litigants . But advocates of user-friendly courts argue that such retooling actually will create more fee-generating work for lawyers . <p> A key element in the movement to help the self-helpers is so-called unbundled services by lawyers . The concept is simple : A self-represented litigant might hire a lawyer to handle just one discrete part of the overall case . <p> The Maricopa County court system now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training them in this new way of marketing their practices . The court has a list of about 100 lawyers willing to handle discrete tasks for self-represented litigants . <p> " This is a new , breaking edge in the law , " says Gordon Griller , court administrator for Maricopa County Superior Court . " We 're not in the business of monitoring lawyer compliance and not in the business of certifying lawyers as unbundling practitioners . We 're just in the business of introducing self-represented litigants to lawyers interested in practicing this way . " <p> This approach strikes some as part of a larger change confronting the profession and the justice system . <p> " Lawyers have simply neglected big parts of the marketplace , " said Robert Hawley , deputy executive director of the State Bar of California , speaking as a panelist at the AJS midyear meeting in Redondo Beach , Calif. , in March . The meeting 's theme concerned challenges and remedies in dealing with self-represented litigants . <p> " We 're talking about the bar 's failure to modify its delivery system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going from a lawyer-driven to a consumer-driven marketplace , and we 've got to adapt to it . " <p> That will not happen without hitches and false starts  --  and a lot of debate among lawyers , judges and court staff . <p> The National Center for State Courts has initiated a collaboration of several interested groups and courts for a novel study of pro se litigants under way in five jurisdictions around the country . They are looking at the possibility of a complete restructuring of the courts  --  and thus the justice system  --  from the bottom up . <p> Law students and design students at the Illinois Institute of Technology are working together on a detailed study of self-represented litigants from the moment they first enter the courthouse to the time they win , lose or give up . <p> The IIT schools involved are Chicago-Kent College of Law and the Institute of Design . They are working with courts in Ventura County ; Boulder , Colo. ; Cook and Lake counties in Illinois ; and Delaware . <p> The student researchers are looking at every stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , docket , rule and requirement  --  with the idea of creating a simplified , streamlined system that can be understood and used by nonlawyers . <p> Rather than trying to provide self-represented litigants with whatever guidance and help they might otherwise get from a lawyer , says Roger K. Warren , president and CEO of the National Center for State Courts , " It makes more sense to look at the underlying processes themselves that could be re-engineered to better serve their needs . " <p> No small part of the effort , too , is assuaging ethical and business concerns of many lawyers , judges and bar leaders . One of the pro se evangelists trying to do so is Jona Goldschmidt , a criminal justice professor at Loyola University in Chicago and author of the AJS 's 1998 best seller , Meeting the Challenge of Pro Se Litigation : A Report and Guidebook for Judges and Court Managers . <p> Goldschmidt often tells audiences at conferences dealing with the issue of pro se litigants that he hopes to provoke them . And often enough he gets the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But the reality is that the train has left the station , and it 's going to happen , " says Goldschmidt , a former assistant director of programs at AJS . " The public is not going to be denied justice any longer . " <p> For Goldschmidt , the legitimacy of the justice system is at stake . And the courts themselves are responding to problems that threaten their ability to operate efficiently and effectively . Balancing Principles and Reality <p> One critic of making it easier for people to represent themselves in court is Edward P. Ryan Jr. , president of the Massachusetts Bar Association , who calls it " the fast food approach . " It staves off hunger in the short run , he says , but a steady diet causes other problems later . <p> " It provides an illusion of justice in the name of simplification , " says Ryan , who is from Fitchburg , " but it does n't provide any kind of quality . " <p> At any stage in the process , he argues , a problem can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer . The self-represented litigant might gain a bit of all three while losing a case that could have been won . <p> And encouraging more do-it-yourself litigants might , he warns , feed the arguments of those who wish to either cut or end funding for the Legal Services Corp . and various legal aid offices . If people can do it themselves , the thinking goes , they do n't need help from legal services lawyers . <p> Ryan advocates greater emphasis on educating the public about the need for lawyers , as well as more creative fee arrangements , and more finely focused and systematic pro bono work by lawyers . <p> But proponents of helping self-represented litigants say all those issues and logistics are part and parcel of the effort to change the system . What they want to do is streamline the process for litigants , simplify the forms , and make rules and procedures less rigid in certain kinds of cases and situations . <p> The need , they say , is for the legal profession to work out the differences between high-minded principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other the gut-level reality of courts swamped with litigants who are on their own . <p> At a recent conference in Massachusetts on pro se litigants , Mary K. Ryan , a Boston lawyer who chairs the ABA legal services delivery committee , was impressed most by the differences between theory and reality in the presentations . <p> " It was really striking that on the first day people were speaking from on high , and the second day we heard from people who work in the courts , who were n't prepared to debate what the bar should do but instead spoke of what they were already doing , " she says . " If you work in the court  --  clerk staff , interpreter , law librarian  --  you have a lot of people coming to you every day , and you want to be able to do something for them . " Champion of Unbundling <p> Forrest " Woody " Mosten is doing it again . It was somewhat revolutionary in 1972 when he and two other lawyers founded what amounted to a nationwide " McLawfirm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broader segment of the public . Now he 's pushing the logical extension of that concept : unbundled legal services . <p> Mosten is credited with creating the term itself , which also is known as discrete-task services . He is acknowledged to be one of the main forces behind the growing use and acceptance of the concept , both by the public and the legal profession . It is a big part of his newest venture , the Mosten Mediation Centers , which launched in 1999 with a single office in Sherman Oaks , Calif . <p> In just two years the operation has grown to 47 offices in 26 states , including 18 offices in California . The growth of mediation has helped drive the increased unbundling of legal services , which in turn has become increasingly important in meeting the needs of self-represented litigants who might want to hire a lawyer for a single aspect of their matter . <p> " Many clients would like to drive a Mercedes , but they ca n't afford it , " Mosten says . " Unbundling is like giving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much better than riding the public bus or walking . " <p> Mosten details this in his book published recently by the ABA Section of Law Practice Management .

A word about it from the pulpit did the rest . <p> After church , 58 parishioners lined up at the door of the customized 35-foot Winnebago outfitted with books , videos and other information to help meet the legal needs of low- and moderate-income individuals who might end up representing themselves in court . <p> " Most of these families have incomes under $2,000 a month , more than half under $1,000 , so we 're not taking work from attorneys , " says Florence Prushan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Los Angeles . She was showing the mobile center , fashioned after bookmobiles , in March at the midyear meeting of the American Judicature Society in Redondo Beach , Calif . <p> The mobile center visits two locations daily . It supplements the court 's primary serf-help center in the Hall of Justice and a second one in the largely Latino La Colonia section of Oxnard . <p> The three centers assist more than 2,000 people a month . Each center has videos , books , Internet access and other materials , many in English and Spanish . And each is staffed by a full-time attorney-coordinator and a court staffer , many of whom are bilingual . <p> The mobile center 's shelf included videos on these topics : lemon law , landlord-tenant and contracts law , conservatorship , self-representation , mediation and domestic-violence restraining orders . <p> Besides the full-time staffing , the centers bring in help from lawyers working pro bono , law student interns and others . Last year , Prushan says , volunteers racked up 3,600 hours .  --  Terry Carter <p> <p> Targeting unbundled services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the law .
