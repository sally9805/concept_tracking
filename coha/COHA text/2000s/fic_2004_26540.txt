A Year and a Day A Novel Bird 1975 Mama came back three days after her funeral . That was my mother , as symbolic as they got . Three days , like she was Jesus Christ himself . " Alice , " she whispered as I was frying up pancakes , willing the bubbles to pop so I could flip them , " it 's Mama . I 'm back . " I reached for the spatula , oddly calm . I 'd read the paragraphs in Dr. Spock 's baby book about the ways children cope with death . Okay , I was fifteen , not a child , but information was information . He did n't talk about hearing voices . So was this real ? She said , " You 've got that syrup turned way too high . " Sure enough , a brown scorchy smell was edging into the kitchen , and the syrup 's surface looked sticky and pocked . I turned the gas burner down to that barely steady level where you do n't want to breathe because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pancakes . Maybe I should have started to panic . Instead , I stared down at the half-done pancakes , touched one with the tips of my fingers . It was warm , springy , real ; I loved the shade of brown pancakes when they were done just right . There was nothing else like that color . That was something Mama had always said : What she liked best was anything there was nothing else like . Again : " I want you to know I 'm right here . " Her words floated like dandelion seeds , breathy , shadowy whispers  --  nothing like the way she had talked when she was alive , loud and too fast , so I always felt a sentence behind , my ears straining to catch up , not wanting to miss a word she said . This was crazy . I yanked my germy hand off the pancake , cleared my throat . " Okay . " My voice felt too big in the kitchen . Maybe this was a dream , though the smell of pancakes , the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real enough . I poked the spatula under the edge of one pancake  --  done  --  then carefully stacked the pancakes on a plate , draped them with a tea towel , popped the plate into the barely warm oven . " Aunt Aggy likes bacon at breakfast , " she said . " I know , " I snapped . But I 'd forgotten about the bacon . Was n't it enough that I was making pancakes the first Sunday after my mother died ? She had always made pancakes on Sunday morning , so here I was . I banged shut the oven door with one foot , then started to cry . My eyes were puffy and sore from nearly a week 's worth of crying , and my nose was rubbed raw , so I tried to stop , lifting my elbow to my face so I could muffle the sobs and blow my nose into the sleeve of my brother 's old Vikings sweatshirt . I had no pride about that sort of thing anymore . Last night at supper , I 'd used the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten soaked through into damp shreds . " Oh , dear . " And then she was gone . But how could she be gone if she was n't really there ? It made no sense , like that question about the tree falling in the forest making no sound . I smeared more tears on my sleeve , ladled batter onto the skillet , waited for the bubbles to pop , a trick Mama had told me . She knew a ton of secrets so her cookies came out perfect and the hash browns never burned , and she was such a good cook she sold wedding cakes to practically every bride in town . None of us needed to learn a thing about cooking because Mama did it all . But now and then I 'd help with pancakes . She hardly slept , not like a normal person anyway , and on Sunday mornings she was slow , sleepy , overflowing with yawns and murmurs . I could ask questions that sounded desperate any other time , like , Am I pretty ? Who do you love best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial says ? She 'd ask me questions , too , not what other mothers asked , like why was I flunking chemistry , and not what adults asked each other , dull questions about Nixon and Watergate , but what did I think was really at the center of the earth and why could n't it be a gigantic diamond instead of boring molten lava ; or how come no one made movies about people living in Iowa like us , and would n't a movie about us be interesting , and who would I want to play her and who me and who my brother and who Aunt Aggy ? Sunday morning was my favorite time with Mama , the slow swirl of her questions coaxing out my own , worth getting up early for . Plus now I could make pancakes that even my brother , Will , could n't tell from hers . The kitchen door swung open , and Aunt Aggy walked in . She was my mother 's aunt , and though technically Mama had inherited this house from my grandmother , Aunt Aggy came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinged-up kitchen table , and the rest of the furniture . She 'd lived here when Mama was growing up and had never left . She was tall and thin and when she walked or sat , she leaned forward so much you could almost hold a protractor to her and say , " Eighty degrees . " Will and I thought it was strange that Aunt Aggy had never been married even though she was already fifty-two , but Mama had said , " Not everyone fits into a happily-ever-after life . " Aunt Aggy claimed she 'd broken off six engagements " with the rings to prove it , " not that I 'd ever seen them . " Alice , " she said , surprised . She tightened the belt of her robe . " What are you doing ? " " Making pancakes for breakfast , " I said ... A Year and a Day
