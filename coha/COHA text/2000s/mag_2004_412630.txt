Museum of Fine Arts , Boston . // REMBRANDT VAN RUN ( 1600-69 ) possessed a gift for visual invention that marked him as one of the greatest storytellers among artists . A master across three media , he radically redefined the technique of etching by bringing to it the freedom of spontaneity of painting and drawing-a rarity of his time , he drew primarily to capture life and stimulate his imagination , not just to make sketches preparatory to painting . " Rembrandt 's Journey : Painter , Draftsman , Etcher " explores the dynamic evolution of the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of his paintings and drawings . Rembrandt repeatedly returned to biblical illustration , portraiture and self-portraiture , the nude , and landscape with fresh insights and interpretations . The Rembrandt of the 163Os-with his emphasis on robust physical action , calligraphic line , and undulating Baroque rhythms - was a wholly different artist from the Rembrandt of the 165Os , with his more serene and meditative moods , controlled and economical use of line , and stable , almost architectural structures . Regardless , the artist remained a master narrator whose literary inventiveness equaled his visual talent . " Rembrandt 's Journey " involves " close looking " on the part of viewers , especially at the expressive details of the etchings . It includes approximately 20 paintings , 33 drawings , 153 prints , and seven original copper etching plates . These masterpieces explore the artist 's emergence as a great storyteller and dramatist , focusing on his Shakespearean range of subject and mood , documenting how he conceived the same subject at different stages of his career . For instance , Rembrandt had a deeper commitment to expressive printmaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on golden Japanese paper is the rare first state of " Christ Preaching ( The Hundred-Guilder Print ) " ( c. 1648 ) . One of Rembrandt 's best-known images in any medium , this etching illustrates in visual terms various aspects of Christ 's teaching as related in the 19th chapter of the gospel of Matthew . Its subtitle comes from the amazing amount the work sold for during the artist 's lifetime . Rembrandt 's drawings , meanwhile , reveal his bold expression of touch and gesture , his acute perception of the visible world , and his insight into the richness of human experience . This can be seen in one of his most deeply expressive narrative efforts , " Christ Carrying the Cross " ( 1635 ) ; an early " Self-Portrait , Bust " ( c. 1628-29 ) ; his amusing record of an old man 's lively encounter with a rambunctious child , " Two Studies of a Child Pulling Off the Cap of an Old Man " ( 1639-40 ) ; and his portrait-like study of two weathered farmhouses , " Two Thatched Cottages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . // " Self-Portrait Leaning on a Stone Sill , " etching ( 1639 ) . Museum of Fine Arts , Boston . // Opposite page : " The HoIy Family with Angels , " oil on canvas ( 1645 ) . The State Hermitage Museum , Saint Petersburg , Russia . // Rembrandt had an ability to reimagine biblical subjects in deeply human terms and give them a unique universality . Close study of the expressions , gestures , and body language of the figures provides detailed insight into the inventive , subtle , and complex way he brought new life to traditional inspirational themes and how he projected himself into them . The cycle of Christ 's passion-from the Last Supper with His apostles , through His arrest , trial , crucifixion , burial , and resurrection-is central to the Christian story . Rembrandt 's commitment to freshly imagining these often-depicted events occurs in two drawings , " Calvary " ( c. mid 1630s ) and " Lamentation at the Foot of the Cross " ( 1634-35 ) and one oil sketch , a modified " Lamentation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidencing Rembrandt 's habit of tearing or cutting up the page in collage-fashion in order to make changes in his compositions . In certain drawings of the 163Os , such as " Christ Carrying the Cross , " the speed and curved rhythms of the urgent marks made with the quill pen and brush are precise equivalents for the intensity of movement and emotion expressed . " The Entombment " ( c. 1630-40 ) , on oak panel , stands out among Rembrandt 's oil sketches because of its extreme fluidity of execution . Like so many of his religious works , it involves an expressive dialogue between dark and light . Four closely interrelated works illustrating the Old Testament span the decade in which Rembrandt moved his artistic activity and his place of residence from his birth city of Leiden to the more cosmopolitan Amsterdam .

" Descent from the Cross " ( 1654 ) in two early impressions-still replete with drypoint burr-one printed on crisp white paper , which snaps the flickering light across the surface , and one printed on Japanese paper , with tone that creates an altogether somber mood . Then , for prints that he changed dramatically from state to state , there is " Christ at Emmaus " ( 1654 ) in different impressions-including the sparkling first state of the etching , as well as the copper printing plate in relatively pristine condition . " The Entombment " ( 1654 ) , meanwhile , represents two states . The first is an open web of lines printed on dazzling white paper that shows off the strength of Rembrandt 's etched linear network as he distinctively developed it from the example of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , obliterates that open network of a highly worked , dense darkness that casts the scene in a much more dramatic tenor . " An Allegory : The Phoenix " ( 1658 ) is a boldly drawn , allegorical image that eludes precise interpretation . One appealing notion is that it represents Rembrandt 's optimistic conviction that he will surmount the financial , critical , and personal challenges he was facing . The mythical phoenix , which was reborn from the ashes of its own funereal pyre , traditionally was shown as a mature , handsome , well-plumaged bird . Rembrandt , with characteristic realism , shows it as a gawky fledgling . A number of 17th-century Dutch artists made self-portraits , but none pursued self-portraiture throughout their careers in three different media with the intensity , variety , and inventiveness that Rembrandt brought to the subject . The well-known painting " The Artist in His Studio " ( 1629 ) has become virtually emblematic of the young Rembrandt and his art . Striking in its stark simplicity , it focuses on the dramatic confrontation between the small figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garb and a looming easel on which rests a large panel held rigid between wooden battens . Between about 1628 and 1631 , Rembrandt etched around 10 small , almost postage stamp-size head and bust self-portraits in which the artist 's features undergo surprising transformations and express a great range of moods . These quirky , personal etchings are without clear precedent in the history of self-portraiture , particularly in printmaking . Scholars have related them to the young Rembrandt 's passionate interest in the expression of human emotions . Two wonderful examples of this are " Self-Portrait in a Cap , " and " Self-Portrait , Open-Mouthed as if Shouting " ( both c. 1628-31 ) . In the first , everything-the contours of his face , mouth , and eyes-is rounded in surprise or wonder . In the second , with brow furrowed and mouth opened wide , Rembrandt seems to be crying out . Later self-portraits tended to become more elaborate and , over the course of the decade , diminish in frequency .

At first , he so completely enveloped himself in his roles that his own identity nearly was lost , but he soon achieved an equilibrium in which he clearly was the star playing the part . // " Flora , " oil on canvas ( 1654 ) . The Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York . // The core of this candid presentation of his own aging image is the steady , dignified , and stoic gaze of his large eyes in their setting of fleshy folds . Moreover , with the palpable tactility of the paint , Rembrandt is able to make visible to us the stresses and strains of a life compounded of creative triumphs and financial reverses . // " The Flute Player , " etching and drypoint ( 1642 ) .

All three are full-dress official portraits that acknowledge the conventions of the day , but transcend them in various ways . // " Female Nude Seated on a Stool , " pen and brown ink , brown wash and white watercolor ( c. 1661-62 ) .

She could be a housewife , an aristocratic beauty , a biblical heroine , or a martyred saint . Four etched examples are the completely engaging " Self-Portrait with Saskia " ( 1636 ) , " Saskia as St. Catherine ( The Little Jewish Bride ) " ( 1638 ) , and two states of " The Great Jewish Bride " ( both 1635 ) . Rembrandt 's obsession with the recording of the real world and his inventive fantasy were inextricably intertwined . he created a cast of imaginary characters , pressing into service his own features as well as those of his models , especially picturesquely seamed and weathered old men . Objective studies from life were quickly transformed into exotic images of oriental monarchs , old soldiers , and venerable rabbis . Three wonderful examples are " An Old Man in a Gorget and Black Cap " ( c. 1631 ) ; the tiny yet powerful " Bust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etching " Old Man with a Divided Fur Cap " ( 1640 ) . Rembrandt drew directly from the nude model and used drawing from the nude as an essential part of the training of his many pupils . His unorthodox vision of the imperfections of the human body and the effect of the pull of gravity on it was already criticized in the 17th century by those who felt the nude should reflect an ideal standard of beauty . Rembrandt 's male and female nudes , enveloped in and caressed by light and shadow , were touchingly vulnerable and real . // " Bearded Old Man Seated in an Armchair , " red and black chalk on pale yellow prepared paper ( 1631 ) . Private Collection . " Jacob Caressing Benjamin , " etching ( c. 1645 ) . Museum of Fine Arts , Boston . // In 1646 and later , Rembrandt organized figure-drawing sessions so that his students could work from nude models . His choice of relatively unprepossessing sitters was remarkable for the time . Traditionally , drawn studies and prints of nude males depicted athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depictions of the human body usually were reserved for images of the aged and infirm . Rembrandt seems to have enlisted young students or workshop assistants for the exercise , as seen in " Male Nudes Seated and Standing ( The Walker ) " ( c. 1646 ) and " Nude Youth Seated Before a Curtain " ( 1646 ) . In his lively etching " Adam and Eve " ( 1638 ) , Rembrandt seized the opportunity provided by the fall from primal innocence of humankind 's first parents to explore the comic irony in the " battle of the sexes . " Painters and printmakers who preceded Rembrandt in the 16th and 17th centuries generally conceived of Adam and Eve as ideals of human physical beauty . Rembrandt 's pair is more primitive and earthy . Past the first flush of youth , they are distinctly naked and dominated by the pull of gravity . Their vulnerable physical appearance already seems to reflect the consequences of the transgression they are in the very act of committing . Rembrandt was not squeamish about the earthy side of life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . he tipped the scales away from the idealization of human behavior , giving greater weight to our failings and foibles . In the etching " The Flute Player " ( 1642 ) , a shepherdess weaves a garland on a leafy embankment while a young shepherd takes advantage of her distraction . Another tiny outdoor pastoral scene , " The Monk in the Cornfield " ( c. 1646 ) participates in a long artistic tradition that satirizes the unchaste behavior of monks and priests . This print is very rare , suggesting that the miniature masterpiece was intended to be shared like an off-color story , only among close friends . And , despite his use of a remarkably similar pose for its protagonists , " The French Bed ( ' Ledikant ' ' ) " ( 1646 ) is far more tender in mood , as Rembrandt seduces us with the velvety lines created by his drypoint needle . // " An Old Man in a Gorget and Black Cap , " oil on panel ( c. 1631 ) .

His quietly radical landscape etchings and drawings-with their amazingly suggestive shorthand-record space , light , and atmosphere with an economy and accuracy that was to transform all future notions of landscape in black and white . Landscape prints were very popular in 17th-century Holland and the portrayal of the native Dutch landscape reached its peak in Rembrandt 's work . he produced 26 landscape etchings dating from 1641 to 1652 , which range in conception from the quick , momentary impression " Six 's Bridge " ( 1645 ) to an elaborate summation concerning nature and man 's relation to it , " The Landscape with Three Trees " ( 1643 ) .
