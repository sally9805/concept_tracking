Section : Photo Essay : Chiapas A photojournalist 's account of the Chiapas uprising <p> Chiapas is what many foreigners might think of when they imagine Mexico . It 's the old Mexico ; in sharp contrast to the heavily populated capital , with its subway system , chic restaurants , high-rises and shopping malls , or the luxury resorts of once remote ocean villages , Chiapas is timeless . It looks and feels more like Guatemala , with its bright hand-woven textiles , barefoot peasants with shiny black braids , and campesinos riding into town on mules . The quaint colonial churches nestle into ancient cobblestone streets and vibrant purple flowers bloom against the dark silhouettes of the Sierra Madre mountains . <p> Chiapas is located in the southeast corner of Mexico . It is the eighth largest state in the country , and one of the poorest . The land is rich in oil , electric energy , cattle , coffee and other valuable products , but the wealth is shipped out to the rest of Mexico , the United States , Canada and other foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas and oil and leaves ecological destruction , agricultural waste , hyperinflation , alcoholism , prostitution and poverty . More than three and a half million people live in Chiapas , but most of them do not have potable water . Ninety percent of the rural population has little or no monetary income , and education , not surprisingly , ranks the worst in the country . Poor health and malnutrition go hand-in-hand with poverty and the death rate is lamentably high . The indigenous people of Mayan decent share the land with mestizos , but the non-Indian elite does not share equally in return . The Chol , Tzottil , Tzeltal , Zoque and Tojolabal peoples have little to offer but their culture and dignity , and even those are being stripped away - all perfectly good reasons to start a war . <p> It starts on New Year 's Day 1994 , the same day that the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) goes into effect . Approximately 2000 armed guerrillas calling themselves the Zapatista Army of National Liberation ( EZLN ) seize four towns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the towns is peaceful , the Mexican army moves in quickly , with the media close behind . I ride the wave of excitement , caught in the swirling tide of rumor versus fact . <p> On January 4 , I join a convoy of seven vehicles and begin the treacherous drive to the town of Ocosingo , where some of the worst fighting has occurred . Along the winding mountain roads we encounter roadblocks of massive pine trees , hastily chopped and placed in our path . Everyone scrambles to lift , push , pull and chainsaw the blockades . What usually is a two-hour drive stretches into seven and some of the correspondents turn back . I stay with the dwindling group , each carload tense and quiet . A thick silence blankets the terrain . The countryside is normally alive with music , animals , conversation and traffic , but today there is nothing . Not a sound . Even the birds seem to have fled the region . The roar of our engines vibrates against the pavement , making an unsettling noise . Fearful of sniper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddle in our seats . <p> Entering the region in our visibly marked press cars bearing white flags , we encounter people cautiously emerging from their houses after two days of hiding . They venture out fearfully , curiosity and hope turning to jubilation as they cheer our progress into town . We have liberated them from the unknown and a deafening silence . <p> Along the way , doors fly open and tearful , frightened people point , jabbing the air , whispering , " El mercado . Vayan almercado " The open-air market , a corrugated roof covering its meager structure , appears to be the main battleground . Between the colorful stalls of lettuce , eggplant , chilies and squash , pools of blood and bits of flesh litter the concrete floor . A man dressed in a blue plaid shirt lies face down ; he seems to be a civilian who was caught in the crossfire . I move quickly through the space , stepping over piles of goods pushed hurriedly into the aisles to form a blockade or shield . A cleanshaven man lies with eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bullet-riddled body . Another man sprawls on sacks of cornmeal , his blood mixing into the powder , forming reddish clumps of dough . Three men together seem to have been shot in the back as they fled ; they died with twisted faces and clenched hands , one reaching out to some unseen object . Another body , blown beyond recognition from the force of the ammunition , lies in pieces near the meat counter . I can not think about what I am seeing - not right now , anyway . I am thinking about composition , reporting the facts , shooting at 1/500 of a second , do I need a fillflash , reducing the violent environment to a 35-millimeter viewfinder on my camera and trying not to get blood on my shoes . There is no sound in the marketplace , only fear thumping loudly in my brain . <p> I move to a passageway with no roof , squinting in the sunlight . The uneven pavement is wet , perhaps from workers spraying down the fruits and vegetables . A wooden crate is torn apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pool of blood . Propped against the crate is a handmade wooden rifle . It 's a toy ! These rebels did not even have real guns , and certainly no ammunition . My throat tightens . Next to the toy gun are dozens of spent shells , which came from very real weapons . <p> The afternoon sun glints off the bloodied water on the pavement . The light shimmers and the reflections dance into a dark corner . My eyes follow and I stand frozen for what seems like hours , staring but not seeing , knowing but not understanding . Five men lie face down on the pavement , bodies beaten , hands tied crudely behind their backs . Each has been shot with a bullet to the head . They look to be in their mid 20s , all Indians . Mud has dried to a light color on their clothes . One of the men is missing a boot ; where did it go ? Next to him is a man with mismatched blue socks but no shoes . I notice his socks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who took their shoes ? I stay , looking at their feet . They seem to be the safest things to look at . I glance down at my own feet and see the blood covering the floor ; I carry the thick red liquid on my boots . I pick up a bullet and instinctively put it in my pocket . I photograph the bodies from every angle and leave the area . <p> Eleven men were killed in the market that day . I carry their blood in my footprints . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The Mexican army responds to the peasant uprising with thousands of well-armed and trained soldiers . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : For decades , a combination of government and private interests has taken land away from the campesinos , leaving them with no place to live or raise their crops . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Children in Chiapas rarely attend school past second grade .
