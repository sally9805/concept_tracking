<p> Find a spot to stand in the third-base dugout at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago , train your eyes and ears on Ozzie Guillen for an interview and absorb 15 minutes with Ozzie . Or maybe 20 or 25 . His words come fast , sometimes faster than his complete thoughts . <p> Guillen is the chatty manager of the Chicago White Sox , who have surprised many and shocked some by having the best record in the major leagues . Ask a question and Guillen answers . Quickly . His responses are usually lengthy , sometimes controversial and always candid . <p> During one entertaining session , Guillen guessed that the White Sox could become beloved by 2006 . But that is only if they win the World Series this year . He called the Yankees a last-place team before they officially became one after being asked to compare their pitching with his . He was miffed that people still doubted the White Sox , but he later said that the team had to earn additional respect . <p> " When I came out and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant that we were going to play Ozzie Ball , " Guillen said . " But we 're going to play baseball . We 're going to play the game the way we 're supposed to . " <p> Guillen said that meant advancing runners , making routine as well as nifty plays , smacking timely hits , pitching deep into games , caring about one another and winning when they should . All of this happens or does not happen with Guillen 's voice , in Spanish or English , his cackle or his whistle providing the background noise . <p> The White Sox are winning , winning often , in dramatic and even ugly fashion , because their pitching has been outstanding . Jon Garland is 6-0 and has been as impressive as any pitcher in baseball . Their defense is reliable and their hitters have showed up on time , which is the nicest thing to say about their soft-as-a-sponge lineup . <p> Yet the pitching staff , which includes two former Yankees in the starting rotation , Orlando Hernandez and Jose Contreras , has helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a 10-7 victory over the Blue Jays yesterday in Toronto , the White Sox are now 23-7 and have equaled the start of the 1912 and 1919 teams . <p> " This is the best pitching staff , collectively , I 've ever seen , " said Frank Thomas , the injured designated hitter . <p> Even with the great record , the great pitchers and the great expectations , occasional feelings of inferiority and uncertainty swirl . The White Sox , who set a record by having a lead in their first 29 games , say others expect their magic to disappear . <p> " This is n't a fluke , " reliever Dustin Hermanson said . " We 're not just playing well for the last month . We 're a good team . " <p> First baseman Paul Konerko addressed a question about searching for respect while never lifting his eyes from the carpet . <p> " To answer that means I actually care what people think , " he said . " I really do n't have an answer for that . " <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mark Buehrle , Freddy Garcia , Garland , Hernandez and Contreras continue to dominate ? How long can the White Sox sail with an offense that includes one starter hitting above .280 , Tadahito Iguchi , and two run producers , Jermaine Dye and Konerko , hitting near .200 ? Can Guillen really use multiple closers ? <p> If all of those questions were not enough , the White Sox must understand they are second fiddlers to the Cubs in this city . On a gorgeous 71-degree day Thursday , 15,389 fans watched the White Sox edge the Kansas City Royals , 2-1 . If the Cubs had played at Wrigley Field , the game would have been sold out . <p> So when General Manager Kenny Williams was informed of Guillen 's assertion that the White Sox needed their first championship since 1917 to grab the soul of the city , he corrected him . <p> " I think Ozzie 's way off base on that , " Williams said . " I think we have to win a World Series , and then we have to follow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw 20,044 fans a game , one of the lowest totals in the majors . But Jerry Reinsdorf , their owner , blamed the cool weather for a half-empty stadium , and he said fans would support a competitive club . <p> " The Cubs are the Cubs , " he said . " We compete against ourselves . " <p> So far , the White Sox have competed against themselves in a way . Their pitching is competing to see how superb it can be , their hitting is competing to be more productive and Guillen is competing to see how much attention his personality can generate . Garland has been an ace as the fifth starter ; his victory yesterday came on the heels of two straight shutouts , and he has a 2.42 earned run average . Buehrle is an underrated left-hander who pitched one game that lasted 99 minutes . Hernandez is lean and smiling again , and he has become Contreras 's part-time pitching coach . <p> Garcia , who is married to Guillen 's niece , realizes that a solid start does not guarantee a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove it for a whole season , " Garcia said of the rotation , which was 18-3 with a 2.98 E.R.A. after yesterday 's game . " People want to see us prove it . " <p> As Hernandez surveyed a clubhouse that includes the unpredictable Carl Everett and Timo Perez , a former Met , he sounded apologetic about the atmosphere . <p> " There 's no pressure here , " Hernandez said . " It 's not like New York . I liked New York , but some people ca n't handle it . Here ? It 's relaxed . " <p> Guillen has shown he is a manager , not just a motor mouth , by his handling of the bullpen . Shingo Takatsu , who throws 68 miles an hour and was nicknamed Mr. Zero in Japan for his postseason perfection , typically closes . But Guillen also trusts Hermanson and Damaso Marte in the ninth . <p> " If I put you in there in the seventh , close the seventh , " Guillen said . " If it 's the eighth , close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth . " <p> The White Sox were disappointing at the plate , with a .256 average and a .321 on-base percentage after yesterday 's game . Only Everett , who was batting .260 with 4 homers and 25 runs batted in , and Iguchi , who was hitting .333 , have been steady . Chicago could use a boost from Thomas , who hopes to return from ankle surgery in a few weeks . <p> Guillen criticized Thomas 's attitude in the past . Thomas accepted it . Guillen also had a profanity-laced personal dispute with Magglio Ordonez , a former White Sox outfielder and fellow Venezuelan . With Guillen , the next vocal firecracker could come at any moment . The White Sox recognize that . <p> Reinsdorf said : " When Kenny and I got to the point where Kenny wanted to hire him , we said to each other : ' If we go ahead , he 's going to say things that are going to drive us crazy and we 're going to pull our hair out and wish he had n't said them . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yes . " <p> Williams , who has reminded Guillen that his honesty can be misconstrued , said , " What 's wrong with a little flavor and allowing someone to be himself ? " <p> Guillen is usually himself . He shuffles around like the president of a fraternity and has quick conversations with players every day . Rarely are they rated G. <p> " All my meetings are curses , " Guillen said . " That 's the way I talk to my players . That 's the way I communicate with them . " <p> When Guillen was asked if he wanted the White Sox to develop in his animated mold , he said , " No , because then they 're going to get in a lot of trouble . " <p> Reinsdorf said Guillen 's baseball instincts as a 21-year-old shortstop with the White Sox 20 years ago were as sound as his managerial instincts are now . Indeed , after the White Sox loaded the bases against the Royals on Thursday , Guillen instructed Pablo Ozuna to dash down the third-base line to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls to walk in the tying run . The decisive run also scored on a walk . <p> " Call it winning ugly , " Guillen said . <p> The White Sox have built confidence and a lead by winning 18 of 22 games against their American League Central rivals . Royals Manager Tony Pena smiled as he praised the White Sox , who are 6-0 against his team . But when he was asked if they could keep winning , Pena said politely , " Time will tell . " <p> No matter the time , there is no pause button for Guillen 's talk-a-thon . He keeps going , jabbing and jousting . Guillen would prefer that everyone loved him and his team , but he can not control others ' feelings . He controls what he can . <p> " One thing I know is going to happen for sure is we 'll be playing the same game for 162 games , " Guillen said . " No matter how hot or how cold we get , we 're going to play the same way all year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " If I change , I should n't be in a White Sox uniform , " he said . " This is what got me here . This is the way I 've got to be . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
