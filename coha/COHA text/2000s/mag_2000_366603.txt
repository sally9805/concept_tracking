In the end , the trial in Albany never confronted the explosive question that lay at the heart of the case . If the unarmed Amadou Diallo had been a white youth instead of a dark-skinned immigrant from Africa , would he be alive today ? " Race did n't become an issue during the trial , " says attorney Johnnie Cochran , who got his start prosecuting cases of police misconduct in Los Angeles long before he ever heard of O.J. Simpson and who briefly served as a legal adviser to Diallo 's family . " It was like there was a big pink elephant in the room and everyone acted like it was n't there . " <P> That is why the not-guilty verdict left so many black New Yorkers feeling no justice and no peace . It is also why the Rev. Al Sharpton , for all his flaws , has become the man they turn to when they think they have been victimized by racist cops . Sharpton believes the all-white prosecution team from the Bronx district attorney 's office botched the case by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid gloves . " Heck , man , I could have asked better questions than that , " Sharpton scoffed after a gingerly cross-examination of one of the accused officers . " The prosecution failed to raise a lot of issues that would have given the jury a better sense of what they were looking at . They never made it clear that many white cops come into the city thinking that they 're going into the jungle to tame animals rather than serve the people . " <P> Such bluntness , says the Rev. Floyd Flake , a former New York City Congressman , has so enhanced Sharpton 's stature that no Democratic candidate would think of courting the black vote without his endorsement . But Sharpton 's flamboyant image and checkered past have made him an easy target for right-wingers to use against their political enemies . For example , after Bill Bradley assailed George W. Bush for hustling votes at South Carolina 's Bob Jones University , which still bans interracial dating , conservative pundit George F. Will homed in on Bradley 's meetings with Sharpton . Noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tawana Brawley case , " Will asked Bradley in a TV interview , " Are you comfortable around him ? And why ? " Bradley ducked the question . <P> That 's one reason I wish Sharpton , 45 , had the courage to apologize to Steven Pagones , the white former prosecutor he falsely accused of kidnapping and raping Brawley . Admitting that he did Pagones an injustice  --  and paying the $65,000 defamation judgment Pagones won against Sharpton last year  --  is the right thing to do morally . And it would make it harder for Sharpton 's critics to deflect his message by harping on lingering doubts about his character . When I made these points to Sharpton , he replied , " You may be right . " But he insisted that he wo n't even consider apologizing unless he loses an appeal of the slander verdict . <P> It 's a big mistake , maybe even a sin , to wait that long because at his best Sharpton has the makings of a moral leader . You could sense that as he stood outside the courthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one brick be thrown , not one bottle be thrown , " said Sharpton . " Those that believe in Amadou should not betray his memory by acting like those who killed him . " That 's the kind of talk New York needs to hear as it searches for answers to the questions that were not asked at the trial .
