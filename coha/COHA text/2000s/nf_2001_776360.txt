Griping about insufferable conditions was not uncommon , but a number of soldiers took a more drastic step : they deserted . During the Civil War an estimated 280,000 Union and 104,000 Confederate soldiers were classified as deserters  --  to date , the highest rates recorded in American wartime history . ( At the height of the Vietnam War the numbers peaked at 7.4 percent , compared with an average of about 11 percent in the Civil War . ) Punishments for desertion varied from receiving a mere reprimand to being flogged , imprisoned , branded on the face with a " D , " or , in the most serious cases , shot . The latter was rare ; executions could have a counterproductive effect on troops , and the vastly outnumbered Confederacy could hardly spare the men . Newspapers were quick to report when executions were carried out , serving as cautionary reminders to those tempted to flee . But these reports were not always accurate , as a mortified young Union private named Francis Christiance discovered one day while reading the paper . // Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I this day received an issue of the Star and Times containing the following paragraphs which no doubt overwhelmed me as much as it certainly must have done you . " To be shot : Francis Christaince deserter from the ranks of Capt . Truax'es Company , one which we have known for a long time was sentenced to be shot and perhaps met his faith at noon to-day . We have not given this fact publicity before , we did hope for and do not yet despair of a reprieve for the misguided soldier though the fact that this terrible punishment is meted for a second offense seems to abide it :  --  " // I simply deny in to each and every specification contained in the above . // 1st . I am not shot . // 2nd . I am not sentenced to be shot . // 3rd . There has not been here the slightest supposition among the men or myself that I was to be shot . // 4th . I never deserted from Capt . Truax'es Company nor have I ever been tried for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have originated I can not surmise . But if he has feeling for a kind and loving wife , a household of children , not to say of the grief that fills your heart at this report , he certainly would not be humanity to contradict it . // This afternoon Col. Jackson has received a letter requesting the transmission of my dead body to my wife , my feeling may better be imagined than described . The editor of the Star certainly should bare a great deal of the blame for publishing a rumor leaving a whole family on the foundation of what must have been a mere rumor , but this is not the first nor I suppose the last kindness we will receive from those we left behind . // Truly your loving and yet living husband , // Francis Christiance. // Another Union soldier , Charles Bingham , wrote to his wife , Sarah , to describe in chilling detail the execution of a deserter , whose death he witnessed firsthand . // August 9 1863 // Same old camp 6 miles // from Rebbys // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few lines to you again as it is Sunday and did not think that i could let the day pas without a little conversation with you and it may be that you are engaged at the same business at this moment i would like to know if you are out but i supose that the day will be spent in visiting with happy friends and neighbors and i would not wonder if you had a quite a good time at it i hope that you will // i tell you what it is it is so hot here that it ai nt comfortable a setting in the shade and do nothing i had a letter from mother two or three days ago she was well at the time she is to work out there for ten shillings per week and she says that this fall she is a coming out to see you if she lives // the day before yesterday the execution of a man took place out in front of our camp it seems as though he had enlisted some three times getting a big bounty each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him the division that he belonged to was marched out the band playing a lively tune all the while untill they formed a hollow square then came the officer on horse back then came the pallbearers four in number carrying his coffin the one that i spoke of in one of my other letters close to them was the chaplain and the criminal keeping the step as firm as if he was going out on parade // next came the band playing his death march in fine stile but it did not seem to affect him in the least and following them was 12 with loaded guns and i think there was four others with loaded guns in reserve so if the first did not make the work of death complete the others could finish it at once // they marched in and sat the coffin down and took their position behind the man the chaplain then stood by him and made a prayer and shook hands with him bade him good bye and steped back // the officer approached him and he steped forward took off his cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then took a seat on his coffin the officer shook hands with him and bade him good by and steped back to the twelve exicutioners the criminal then raised his hand three times holding it out straight the last time but he did not hold it long before the death messengers hit him he fell from of his coffin and lay there kicking // the officer steped up and called the others they stood there they came puting their guns quite close to him and let drive and that was what all called butchering and then my company right ahead guide right march pass in review pass and the whole division passing by where he lay and so back to their quarters and so ended the life of a Deserter // So i have give you as good an idea of the matter as I can but believe me that i do nt want to see any more such proceedings The first shots i did not mind so much but when the others came up and almost put their guns against his breast and head it all most made me sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not cast as mutch solemnyty over the troops as that one mans death did and what will his wife think when the news reaches her for i have heard that he left a wife and two children // well i must drop this and wind up i am well and doing well and god grant that this bad mess of scribling may find you in good health the weather has been exceedingly hot for all i thought that it was getting colder please write as often as i remain your kind and affectionate husband and shall till death give all the love that you can spare to them that kneeds it only keepe what you want . // Charles E. Bingham , Sarah J. Bingham // so good by for this time
