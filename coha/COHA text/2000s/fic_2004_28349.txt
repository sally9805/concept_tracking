CHAPTER I In early morning light I see , A distant dragon come to me . Kindan was so excited that he practically bounced as he ran up to the heights where Camp Natalon kept its drum , fire beacon , and watch . They 're here ! They 're here ! Zenor shouted down at him . Needing no further urging , Kindan put on an extra burst of speed . Breathless , he joined his friend on the peak where they kept the watch . Looking down at the valley , he could plainly see the large drays rolling ponderously up toward the main camp . Leading them were the smaller , but bright and cheerfully painted domicile wagons owned by the caravanners . From the watch heights , not only could he see all the way across the lake to the bend where the trail turned out of sight , but he could also see the fields on the far side of the lake , which had just been cleared , ready for their first planting of crops . Closer in , he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading up to the depot where the mined and bagged coal was stored , the lighter way leading toward the miners ' houses on the near side of the lake . Most of the houses were in three rows arranged in a U shape around a central square . The open , northern end of the U faced the road . It was there that smaller spice gardens had been planted . And it was in front of those , closer to the main square , that wedding preparations were in progressfor Kindan 's own sister 's wedding . None of those houses were proper houses , built to withstand Threadfall . But Threadfall was a long way offanother sixteen Turnsand the miners were glad to have the temporary comfort oftheir own housing , convenient to the new mine . Midway from the square to the hill was a separate house and a large shed . The house was Kindan 's home and the shed housed Dask , the camp 's sole remaining watch-wher . Dask was bonded to Kindan 's father , Danil . Hidden from the watch point by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdier dwellingthe full stone hold of Natalon , the head Miner in the camp . North of it , separated by a walled-in herb garden , was a smaller but almost as well-built dwelling , the home of the camp 's Harper . Just beyond the Harper 's dwellingthe edge of which was visible from the lookoutthe hillside , a spur from the western mountain , turned abruptly and the plain in front of it rose toward the peak of the mountain , with another spur about two kilometers distant forming a valley . Two hundred meters from the bend and a hundred meters west of the lookout was the entrance to the mine . The boys knew the valley like the backs of their hands , even though it was changing daily and Kindan had been there only six months himself . They paid no attention to the view . Today , not even the novelty of the wedding preparations interested them : The two boys had eyes only for the trader caravan winding its way around the lake below them . Where 's Terregar ? Zenor asked . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sun with his hand , but mostly for show . The distance was far too great to make out one person in the whole caravan . I do n't know , he answered irritably . I 'm sure he 's down there somewhere . Zenor laughed . Well , he 'd better be , or your Sis will kill him . Kindan favored this comment with a glare . Had n't you better get back on down and tell Natalon ? he asked . Me ? Zenor replied . I 'm on watch , not a runner . Shards ! Kindan groaned . I 'm all out of breath , Zenor . He added in a lower tone , And besides , you know how much Natalon wants to hear this news . Zenor 's eyes widened . Oh , yeah , I do ! Everyone knows that he was hoping your Sis would stay at the Camp . Right , Kindan agreed . So just imagine how mad he 'll be at hearing about it from me . Ah , come on , Kindan , Zenor replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan approaching , not just a wedding . Which he has to host , Kindan snapped back . He sighed . Well , if you insist , I 'll go back down . He paused dramatically , eyeing his smaller friend . But Sis said that I 've got to wash Dask tonight . Zenor 's eyes narrowed as he considered this . You mean , if I do the running , you 'll let me help wash the watch-wher ? Kindan grinned . Exactly ! You would ? Zenor repeated hopefully . Your dad wo n't mind ? Kindan shook his head . Not if he does n't find out , he wo n't . The added enticement of doing something unsanctioned brought a gleam to Zenor 's eyes . All right , I 'll do it . Great . Of course , washing a watch-wher 's not the same as oiling a dragon , Zenor went on . The thought of Impressing a dragon , of becoming telepathically linked with one of Pern 's great fire-breathing defenders , was the secret wish of every child on Pern . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few riders were chosen from the Holds and Crafts . And no dragon had ever visited Camp Natalon . You know , Zenor continued , I saw them . Everyone in Instead , he made encouraging noises while hoping that Zenor would n't dawdle too much longer or Natalon would be wondering at the speed of his runnerand might remember who it was . They were so beautiful ! A perfect V formation . Way up high . You could see them : bronze , brown , blue , green . . . Zenor 's voice faded as he recalled the memory . And they looked so soft Soft ? Kindan interrupted , his tone full of disbelief . How could they look soft ? Well , they did ! Not like your father 's watch-wher . Kindan , feeling anger on Dask 's behalf , stomped firmly on his emotion , remembering that he still wanted Zenor to run for him . Is the caravan getting closer ? he asked , hinting broadly . Zenor looked , nodded , and sprinted away from the watch point . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoulder . Never ! Kindan replied . He was delighted at the thought of help with what he was certain was going to be a particularly thorough bathing of the coal mine 's only watch-wher , the night before a major wedding . At the bottom of the hillside , after his long , warm scramble down , Zenor paused and looked back up to where Kindan was now standing watch . It was warmer in the valley and the air was thicker , partly from the moisture in the fields , and partly from the smoke already beginning to rise from the Camp 's fires . Catching his breath , he turned to search for Miner Natalon . He steered for the largest knot of people he could find , figuring that the Camp 's leader would be there . He was right . Natalon was a rangy sort of a man who stood taller than the average . Zenor 's father , Talmaric , had called Natalon a youngster once , but only in a low voice . After hearing that , Zenor had tried to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was five Turns older than Natalon , Natalon 's twenty-six Turns might have been a full hundred when compared to Zenor 's meager ten . Zenor considered calling out , but there was still a lot of confusion over the right title for Natalon . He 'd be Lord Natalon if the Camp proved itself and became a proper Mine but that was still to happen and no one quite knew how to address him now . Zenor opted for worming through the crowd and grabbing at Natalon 's sleeve . Miner Natalon was not pleased to have someone yank on his sleeve in the middle of an argument . He looked down and saw the sweat-stained face of Talmaric 's son but could n't remember the child 's name . It had been so much easier six months earlier , when there 'd only been himself and a few other miners seeking out a new seam of coal . But finding that seam , and still others after it , had been exactly what Natalon had hoped forto start a Camp and prove it into a Mine . Talmaric 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan 's approaching , sir , Zenor said , hoping that sir would not affront the Camp 's head miner . How soon , lad ? Do n't you know how to make a proper report ? a querulous voice barked above Zenor 's ears . He turned and saw that the speaker was Tarik , Natalon 's uncle . Zenor had had several encounters with Tarik 's son , Cristov , and still bore bruises from the last meeting . Rumor had it that Tarik was furious that Crom Hold 's MasterMiner had n't put him in charge of seeking out new coal . Another rumor , whispered quietly among only a few of the Camp 's boys , was that Tarik was doing everything in his power to prove that Natalon was unsuited to run the Camp and that he , Tarik , should be placed in charge . The last set of bruises Zenor had got from Cristov were the result of an ill-placed comment about Cristov 's father . How long until they arrive , Zenor ? a kinder voice asked . It was Danil , Kindan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only surviving watch-wher . I spotted them at the head of the valley , Zenor replied . I imagine it 'll be four , maybe six hours until they reach the camp . They 'd get here faster if the roadway were properly lined , Tarik growled , casting a reproving glare at Natalon.
