" I have no idea who he is , " I said . " Are you sure it 's me ? " " Honey , unless there 's another Albenia Louise Harper living in San Celina , California , I 'm sure it 's you , " Amanda Landry said in her pecan-pie-for-breakfast Alabama drawl . Besides being my good friend and an extraordinary quilter , she was also the volunteer legal counsel for the Josiah Sinclair Folk Art Museum and artists ' co-op where I was curator . " You are , without a doubt , an heiress . " " What do I inherit ? " In the background , I heard another phone ring . She must have been calling from her office above the new Ross store downtown . " Do you want me to hold ? " " No , ma'am . I know who it is and I 'm a-tryin ' to hide from him . " I laughed and asked , " Who is it this time ? " Amanda 's love life was the only place in her life where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Her wisest move so far was she had never married any of her unique and varied suitors . Yet . " This plumb crazy public defender I went on one lousy date with , and now he thinks he 's in love . Lordy , he showed up wearin ' white socks with coral Hushpuppies . Coral ! It looked like a couple of lobsters died on his feet . What was I thinking ? " " You were n't . That 's the whole problem with you and men . But we 'll dissect your love life later . Are you sure this is for real ? " " As real as your cattle brand , babydoll . " " Who is this Jacob Chandler ? I 've never heard of him . " " Look , I was justnotified by the deputy coroner early this morning myself . Too early . He interrupted an extremely pleasant interlude with Mel Gibson . At any rate , this poor old Mr. Chandler had a heart attack last night , that 's all I know . Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this all official-like ? Since you 're the heiress , you can buy me lunch . " " Is there money involved ? " Thoughts of the new one-ton truck I 'd been eyeing at the Chevy dealership danced in my head . I 'd given away my old Harper ranch truck to my brother-in-law last November and had been driving Gabe 's restored 1950 Chevy pickup for the last five months . Being curator of the folk art museum as well as still working occasionally at my dad 's ranch , I needed a vehicle I could use without worrying about scratching the paint . Not to mention one with a decent radio . Gabe and I had talked about buying another truck , and he was ready to write the check , but I 'd wanted to buy it myself since he already carried more of the financial burden in our new marriage than felt comfortable to me . A sudden stream of guilt and shame washed over me . Someone had died , perhaps someone I knew , and the only thing on my mind was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank account , " Amanda continued , " but I have no idea how much is in it . I drew up the will a few years ago and do n't really remember how much this guy is worth . Do n't get rid of that handsome hunk of Latino chauvinism yet . See you at noon . " When Gabe came in from his morning jog , he found me staring at the kitchen floor . " What 's wrong ? " he asked , cocking his head and zeroing in with that pervasive gaze many cops pick up during their careers . I looked up at him and smiled . " How was your run ? " He glanced at the cow-shaped kitchen clock . " Took a half hour longer than usual because Mrs. Potter down the street wanted to talk about whether or not we 're going to have Mardi Gras next year and what was I going to do about the naked woman she saw at the last one . " " Naked woman ? I do n't remember any naked woman . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits as part of her costume and was duly shocked . " " Those things are gross , but are they actually against the law ? " He grinned . " Not in any place I want to live . " I rolled my eyes . " I 'm assuming you did n't tell Mrs. Potter that . " " No , I told her I 'd look into it and get back to her , though I do n't even know yet myself if we 're going to have Mardi Gras next year . All depends on whether the city council agrees to pay the overtime for my officers and reserves . I ca n't possibly squeeze the cost out of our budget , but they want both the city and the crowds downtown protected . " He shrugged and dried his sweating brown face on a kitchen towel . I gave his left biceps an encouraging squeeze . " It 's only May first so you have almost a whole year to figure something out . And you will . You always do . " " Mrs. Potter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just smiled real pretty at her , and she was like putty in your hands . " He winked at me and did n't answer . My blue-eyed , part-Hispanic husband was a handsome man and was not above utilizing his physical attributes when it suited his purpose . But he was also a top-notch police chief and cared deeply about the people of San Celina . This kind of thing regularly happened to him when he was jogging , some citizen flagging him down , determined to relay some complaint or suggestion they felt he needed to know right now . He handled the interruptions with gracious aplomb , jogging in place and patiently listening to their often long-winded diatribes , promising to look into it and always keeping that promise . I was proud of my husband of fifteen months and the way he 'd managed , after twenty years of working the roughest precincts in L.A. , to adapt to the diverse society of our Central California coastal town with its cornucopia of city-fleeing retirees , rambunctious college students , traditional ranchers and farmers , oil workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said . " I repeat , what 's wrong ? " I opened the refrigerator and poured him a glass of grape juice . " What makes you think anything 's wrong ? " He looked at me over his glass , his blue-gray eyes amused . My inability to hide my feelings had been a sore spot between us since we first met . Well , a sore spot for me . He found no end of amusement in it . I stuck my tongue out at him . " Very subtle , chica , " he said . " So , what 's up ? " I considered making him suffer by not telling him , except I was dying to tell someone . " I 'm an heiress . " " Who died ? " He finished the juice in three gulps and set the empty glass in the sink . " Someone named Jacob Chandler of Morro Bay . " " Who 's he ? " " I have no idea . I 'm meeting Amanda for lunch at Liddie 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave a disbelieving grunt . " Are you sure this is n't a joke ? You know Amanda . " He and Amanda had a somewhat love-hate relationship because his sometimes cute , sometimes irritating male chauvinism alternately amused and annoyed her vehemently feminist sensibilities . They traded cop and attorney jokes like baseball cardseach trying to outdo the other . Deep down , they had a profound respect for one another , but they would rather have eaten worm soup than admit it out loud . " I do n't think so , " I said , sitting down on a pine kitchen chair . " So what did he leave you ? " " Apparently everything he owns . " " Which is ? " " That 's what I 'll find out at lunch . " He frowned . " I do n't like the sound of this . " " Sergeant Friday , " I said , using the often appropriate nickname I gave him the first time we met , " it 's Saturday . Take off the cop hat and quit worrying . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally strange , to display at the folk art museum . " " You 're probably right , " he said , pulling me out of my chair and against him . He smelled of clean , salty sweat and spicy deodorant . " So , Ms. Rockefeller , how about a little Mexican rhumba with the help tonight ? " " Sure , you know a young , sexy pool boy who knows how to dance ? " He untied my terry cloth robe and slipped his hands under my cotton tank top . " I was thinking some oak-grilled salmon and a midnight ride on the ranch . It 's a full moon . They say it 's good luck to make love under a full moon . " " Who says that ? " I asked , giving a little shiver when his thumb probed the place on my spine he knew was my weak spot . " You know , they do . " " Buy me Maine lobster , and I might consider it . " I squirmed out of his arms and headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the head with his damp , balled-up T-shirt . " Woman , you get more expensive every day . " I picked it up and threw it back . " And who knows , after this afternoon , you might not be able to afford me anymore . " I pulled on a clean pair of Wranglers and a white T-shirt while he took a shower . I was sitting at my antique vanity braiding my hair when he came out of our small bathroom and rummaged through our packed closet . He pulled on new dark blue Levi 's and a red polo shirt , toweling his shaggy black hair . " I 'll be back from Santa Mafia by four . Think about that ride . I was up with your dad on Kenyon Flat last Sunday . The grass is as thick as a mattress . " He gave me his sexiest smile . Laughing , I wrapped a rubber band around the end of my braid . " Geeze , Friday , your subtle technique is so hard to resist . " Amanda was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only old-fashioned 24-hour cafe left in town . She waved at me from one of the red vinyl window booths . Seconds after I slid across from her , Nadine , Liddie 's head waitress , walked up . " Looky what the cat drug in , " Nadine said . Her brown sparrow eyes glared at us from behind thick pink plastic glasses . She treated everyone from the mayor to the lowliest Cal Poly freshman with the same irritable disrespect . You put up with it or learned that your favorite pie was always out . " How 's my boy ? " she asked me . She adored Gabe and made no bones about showing it . " He 's going to Santa Mafia today . Police business , I think . " " You tell him I have some fresh local raspberries I 'm saving for his lunch Monday . Do n't you forget , now . " " Nadine , I swear he 's gon na leave me for you any day now . " " And he 'd be better off by a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked , " So , what 'll it be , chickadees ? I ai n't got all day . " " Cheeseburger , Coke , and onion rings , " I said . " Heart attack special , got it , " she replied , then looked at Amanda . " And you , Miss Fancy Pants Lawyer Lady ? " " Nadine , I swear I 'd like to take you home with me , " Amanda said . " You bring to mind my dear memaw back in Alabama , the Lord rest her cantankerous ole soul . " Nadine smacked Amanda on the head with her order pad , which was just the reaction Amanda was angling for . " Someone should wash that smart-alecky mouth of yours out with an old bar of Lava soap . " Amanda winked at me . " I 've had some fellow attorneys say that very thing . " Her wide mouth turned up in a glorious , toothpaste-selling grin that never failed to melt even the most cynical prosecuting attorneyproviding that attorney was male . " Chef 's salad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the salad , not in the tea . Ma'am . " " I 'll ma'am you , " Nadine muttered , her back already to us . " I love her , " Amanda said , running her fingers through her thick , sherry-colored hair . " Think she 'd consider coming to work for me ? " " You do like living on the edge , " I said , sipping my water . " Forget Nadine . Who the heck is this Jacob Chandler , and what have I inherited ? " She pulled a sheaf of legal-sized papers out of her leather briefcase . " I 'll tell you all I know , which is n't much . " She laid the papers down in front of me and said , " Mr. Jacob Chandler of Morro Bay , California , died of an apparent heart attack last night , and you are his sole heir . " I thumbed through the papers which were full of legalese , then looked up at her . " Give me the Reader 's Digest version . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all his possessions , and whatever is contained in his bank account at the Paso Robles Branch of the San Celina Savings and Loan . " " A house ? And all his possessions ? Who was he ? " " All I know about him is he came into my office when I first opened my practice and asked me to draw up his will . I did n't even know you then , so your name did n't mean squat to me . Frankly , I 'd forgotten all about it until I was notified of his death by the deputy coroner . He apparently has no next of kin and is to be buried in a plot he bought some time ago at the Paso Robles cemetery . The mortuary address where they took his body is in there . Everything 's been picked out and paid for . You just need to set a date for burial . I 'm the executor , and they 're waiting for instructions from me . And I 'm waiting for instructions from you . " " This is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Nadine brought our lunches . " I swear I do n't know him . " Amanda searched the plates of food . " Where 's my dressing ? " " You do n't need it , missy , " Nadine answered . " That blue suit of yours was looking a tad snug in the hips the last time you was in here . " She swung around and stomped away . Amanda sighed and dug into her salad . " I sure do miss my memaw . " " So , what do I do ? " She forked a slice of turkey breast . " You go check out your new house and then call a realtor . " " But I have no idea who this man is ! " The thought of a stranger leaving me something as valuable as a house , not to mention all his worldly possessions , was intriguing , but also a little unsettling . I picked up the will again , trying to glean some answers from its neat black and white lines , but for all they told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's the house keys . " Amanda pushed a set of keys across the table to me . They were attached to a small , hand-carved cowboy boot . I ran my finger over the intricately carved boottiny stars , roses , and horseshoes covered the shaft . SomeoneMr Chandler ? was a very talented wood-carver . I peered closer at the key ring and looked up at Amanda in surprise . " My name is carved on this ! " Albenia was cleverly hidden in fancy script among the elaborate decorations . " Looks like Mr. Chandler knew you , " she said , grabbing one of my onion rings . " By the way , there 's one little stipulation to the will . " " I knew there had to be a catch . " " To inherit his estate , you must reside in the house for two consecutive weeks starting the day the will is read to you . " " What ? " " Alone . No overnight guests . " " What ? " She laughed . " You said that already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , ma'am , it 's part of the will . If you do n't comply , the estate goes to the Federal Government to help lower the national debt . " " What ? " I squeaked . " And before you ask , yes , it 's all legal and above-board . There 's nothing you can do except follow the will 's instructions or let the money go to our wonderfully screwed-up government . " She stole another onion ring and dipped it in the ketchup spreading across my plate . I groaned . " Gabe is going to have a fit when he hears this . He was suspicious about it from the start . " " This truly is the weirdest inheritance I 've come across in my entire legal career . Are you sure you do n't know who this guy is ? " " Have n't a clue . " I slipped the key ring in my purse and picked up my hamburger . " But you can be darn sure about one thing . I 'm gon na find out . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
