Abner &; Me By Dan Gutman HarperCollins Publishers , Inc . Dan Gutman Anti-Social Studies " Hey , what 's up with you , stoshack ? " Kenny Cohen was whispering from the seat behind mine . It was the middle of social studies and Mrs. Van Hook was giving a boring lecture about the Civil War . Something about the Missouri Compromise . Learning about battles and stuff was pretty cool , but all that junk about what led up to the war did n't interest me much . " What do you mean , what 's up with me ? " I asked , leaning back in my chair so Mrs. Van Hook would n't catch me whispering to Kenny . " People are talking about you , man . " " Oh yeah ? " I asked Kenny . " And what are these people saying ? " " They 're saying you 're a freak . They 're saying you got magic powers or something . " That got my attention . " What kind of magic powers ? " I asked , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kenny said . " Like you can travel through time and crap like that . " " Yeah , right , " I whispered . " Do you think that if I could travel through time and go to any year in the history of the world , I 'd be sitting here listening to this ? " Kenny snickered . The fact is , I can travel through time -- with baseball cards . That 's not a joke . Ever since I was a little kid , I 've had this . . . power , I guess you 'd call it . Something strange happened to me whenever I touched an old baseball card . It was a buzzy , vibrating feeling . Itdid n't hurt , but it was kind of scary . I would drop the card right away , and the tingling sensation would stop . Then one day , I decided to keep holding on to the card . That buzzy feeling went up my arm and across my body . And the next thing I knew , I was in a different place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1909 and I met Honus Wagner . You do n't have to believe me if you do n't want to . But I know what happened to me . I can do it whenever I want . What I did n't know was how Kenny Cohen found out I could travel through time . I had n't exactly broadcast the news . I did n't want kids to think I was nuts . Only a few people knew about it . My mom and dad knew . My baseball coach , Flip Valentini , knew . My nine-year-old cousin Samantha knew . " Yo , Kenny , " I whispered , turning around in my seat , " who told you that crap about me ? " " Fuller , " he said . Bobby Fuller ! That figured . I should have known . Bobby Fuller has had it in for me ever since I hit a double off him to break up his no-hitter . And that was back in our T-shirt league days ! You 'd think he would forget about it by the time we got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past few weeks , he had been tormenting me whenever he saw me in the hall or on the ball field . I 'm just glad he 's not in any of my classes this year . Some people just rub you the wrong way . Fuller and Kenny were on the same team . They 're a couple of prejuvenile delinquents . They should form the Future Inmates of America Club . I 'm sure that ten years from now I 'll pick up a newspaper and read that the two of them were arrested for something or other . " Fuller said you were a freak , " Kenny whispered . " He said you 're an alien disguised as a human . He said he 's gon na get you at the game after school today . " " That what he said ? " I asked . " Yeah , are you gon na show ? " " Of course I 'm gon na show , " I said . " Bobby Fuller does n't scare me . " " Mr. Stoshack ! Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is so important that you need to discuss it in the middle of my class ? " " Uh , baseball , Mrs. Van Hook , " Kenny said . What an idiot ! Any fool knows that when the teacher catches you talking and asks you what you 're talking about , you 're supposed to say , " Nothing . " Kenny Cohen is a moron . " Baseball ? " spat Mrs. Van Hook . " The Civil War was perhaps the most important event in our nation 's history . It defined us as a nation . And you 're talking about baseball ? Tell me , do you boys find the Civil War to be boring ? " " Oh no , Mrs. Van Hook ! " I said , jumping in before Kenny had the chance to say something stupid like , " Yes . " " Good . Because over the weekend I want you to read Chapter Twenty-six in your textbooks . There will be a test on this material next week . " Everybody groaned , out of habit . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed a finger at me and gestured for me to come to her desk . " Is something wrong at home , Joseph ? " she asked once all the other kids had left the room . Most everybody at school knew that my dad had been in a pretty bad car accident not long ago . Some people had been acting weird toward me , going out of their way to be all nice to make me feel better . " No , " I said . " Everything 's fine . " " I do n't like what I see , Joseph , " said Mrs. Van Hook . " Your grades have been slipping . You 're heading for a C this marking period , maybe even a D. You 're a better student than that . " " I 'll bring it up , Mrs. Van Hook , " I said . " Promise . " D in social studies . Ha ! Little did I know that getting a D would be the least of my problems .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
