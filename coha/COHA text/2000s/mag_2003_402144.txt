Tired of asking your kid for the umpteenth time to get a move on in the morning/clean up his room/get off the darn phone ? Try these solutions . // dirty looks , muttered complaints , defiant declarations of " You ca n't make me ! " : Your child probably has all sorts of delightful reactions when you ask her to do daily tasks , from brushing her teeth to making her bed . That type of response is called provocative communication ( translation : any statement or gesture from a child that 's rude , inappropriate , or hurtful ) . And as a child psychotherapist with more than 30 years of experience , I can tell you that it 's a natural part of growing up . But that does n't mean you have to live with it . Below you 'll find effective strategies for ending the conflict . First , though , know this : You need to stop spouting orders and warnings like a drill sergeant ( " Make that bed , now ! " ) . The reasons : Your kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the message . What 's more , when your child behaves provocatively , her objective is to elicit a reaction from you . By remaining calm , you deprive provocative communication of its power , which can lead to real improvement in your child 's behavior . So read on and learn the right way to react . The morning coma * If trying to drag your child out of bed in the morning is a recurrent problem inyour family , you need to address it the night before , not at 7 a.m . Say calmly , " There are going to be some new rules tomorrow morning . I know it 's very hard for you to get up for camp , but we have to stop arguing about it every morning . So from now on , I am not going to ask you to get up more than two times . If you do n't get up right away after the second time I 've asked , you 'll automatically have to go to bed a half-hour earlier that night . If that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on Saturday , even if it means missing your soccer game . If you get up on time , there 'll be no consequences , except that we 'll have no more arguments in the morning . I hope that 's what you choose to do . " Enforce and increase the consequences as required , without negotiation . You may also want to think about whether your child needs more sleep in general . Or maybe your child is the type who sits up in bed when the alarm goes off , but then makes very little progress ( teeth are n't brushed , breakfast gets cold , etc . ) . Once again , deal with the problem the night before . Say to your child , " We have to stop all the slowness in the morning before camp . So there are going to be some new rules . I will not tell you more than two times to get going or to hurry . I wo n't follow you around anymore . If you 're not dressed in time to leave , I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your pajamas if that 's all you 're wearing . If you 're not in the kitchen in time for breakfast , you 'll miss it . If this does n't work , then you 'll have to start going to bed an hour earlier until you learn to get moving on your own , on time . I know you can do it ! " Incentives can also be very helpful in lighting a fire under slow risers-particularly younger children , who often respond to an On-Time Chart , with end-of-the-week prizes ( such as a special outing with Mom or Dad ) for five consecutive days of cooperation ( that is , getting up on time ) . As for an older child , you can also induce him to abandon his dawdling ways simply by taking him to camp whenever he 's ready-however late that may be . Then he 'll confront the camp 's consequences for tardy arrivals , which places the responsibility squarely in his lap . Sloppy bedrooms * Most children have a much higher mess threshold than adults . What to do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by assessing the rest of the house and , in particular , your own bedroom . Is it neat ? Do n't be a " Do as I say , not as I do " parent , since children are supremely sensitive to hypocrisy . Resist the urge to nag your messy child ; it does n't work . Instead establish a regular pickup period at the end of the day , and remain in her room to see that it 's observed . A child younger than 5 will usually need help with the picking up . An older child should be able to manage it alone , though you may need to help her select appropriate storage places for her possessions . ( Often kids really do n't know where their stuff belongs ! ) If your child does her pickup duty , praise her for her effort . If she does n't , use consequences , calmly explaining the why 's and how 's . For example , toys that have not been put away can be placed off-limits for a day ( some parents call this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling to an Ozzie-and-Harriet fantasy about family meals . They imagine their children politely passing the food around the table , conversing amiably about their day . Forget it ! I tell parents to be realistic about mealtimes , especially with preschoolers . For instance , be flexible about manners : Kids learn to eat more delicately as they get older , through observation of others and a growing awareness of whether they 're out of step with appropriate social behavior . And do n't insist that children remain at the table well after they 're done eating , waiting for the adults to finish . I believe that 15 or 20 minutes at the table is enough for children up to 10 years old . Make mealtime a positive experience for your child . Model a happy , friendly mood-it 's contagious . And ask him about his day , but be specific . ( " What did you do in school ? " is a boring question for kids ; it 's too vague . ) Inquire about particular friends , activities , or teachers . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made any pictures that day . If and when your child is provocative and rude at mealtime , say , " If you can talk in a friendlier way , I will listen to what you 're trying to tell me . " If he responds favorably , praise the effort . Tell him , " That sounded much nicer . Thank you . " If not-and if such behavior has been a continuing problem-say , " If you do n't get yourself in control and use a friendly voice , you wo n't be able to insert a consequence that is meaningful to your kid , such as not letting him go to baseball practice . I 'll give you five minutes . " Later tell him that the same consequence will occur whenever he behaves badly at mealtime . Finally , do n't make a big issue with your child about finishing all his food . Even the most picky childhood eating habits are essentially normal and almost invariably fade with time . So calmly encourage your child to eat sensibly . If he does , praise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Technology wars * A lot of provocative communication can arise in connection with television , computer , and telephone use . TV and video games as well as the Internet all have addictive qualities . The telephone , too , can begin to occupy more and more of a child 's free time from late preadolescence onward . Provocative behavior here often takes the form of little white lies like , " Mom , I 've only been playing Space Pulverizer for five minutes ! " If your child 's use of these devices becomes excessive , establish specific limits on these activities . It 's generally best to list such activities and time limits in writing-one hour of TV a day , 30 minutes of phone time , and so forth . Have your child sign the list . And set the limits in a firm but empathetic way . Tell your child , " I know you enjoy playing computer games , but you 're spending way too much time in front of the screen . So from now on , we 're going to have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . You should also let her know that if she continues to be provocative after time limits have expired , you may have to resort to consequences ( such as no use of e-mail or the telephone for the evening ) . If the misbehavior persists , increase the same punishment ( e.g. , no use of the above for two days ) . She 'll get the idea . Sidebar Resist the urge to nag your messy child ; it does n't work . Sidebar KIDS AND DAILY DUTIES : 4 need-to-know facts * Children need time to learn and perform daily responsibilities . Be patient ! * Your child will also need time to adjust to changes in your disciplinary style . If you 've given him reason to believe you mean business only when you shout , he 'll have to unlearn that attitude before the remedies described here can work . * Try incentives , such as progress charts , before resorting to consequences , especially with younger children . That way you 'll create a positive reinforcement for doing the desired task . * If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that it will be carried out if the stated rule has been broken .
