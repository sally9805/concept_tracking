They called it taking four . The tall , gaunt monk hovered at the lip of the five-hundred-foot cliff , nothing restraining him but the raw Himalayan wind . Shan Tao Yun squinted at the figure to see better . His heart clenched . It was Trinle who was going to jumpTrinle , his friend , who just that morning had whispered a blessing on Shan 's feet so they would not trample insects . Shan dropped his wheelbarrow and ran . As Trinle leaned outward , the updraft pushed back , ripping away his khata , the makeshift prayer scarf he secretly wore around his neck . Shan weaved around men swinging sledgehammers and pickaxes , then stumbled in the gravel . Behind him a whistle blew , followed by an angry shout . The wind played with the dirty scrap of white silk , dangling it above Trinle 's reach , then slowly twisting it skyward . As it rose , the prisoners watched the khata , not in surprise but in reverence . Every action had a meaning , they knew , and the subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guards shouted again . But not a man returned to his work . It was a moment of abject beauty , the white cloth dancing in the cobalt sky , two hundred haggard faces looking upward in hope of revelation , ignoring the punishment that would surely come for even a minute 's lost time . It was the kind of moment Shan had learned to expect in Tibet . But Trinle , hanging at the edge , looked downward again with a calm , expectant gaze . Shan had seen others take four , all with the same anticipation on their faces . It always happened likethis , abruptly , as if they were suddenly compelled by a voice no one else could hear . Suicide was a grave sin , certain to bring reincarnation as a lower life form . But opting for life on four legs could be a tempting alternative to life on two in a Chinese hard labor brigade . Shan scrambled forward and grabbed Trinle 's arm just as he bent over the rim . Instantly Shan realized he had mistaken Trinle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , on a ledge barely wide enough to accommodate a swallow 's nest , lay a glittering gold object . A cigarette lighter . A murmur of excitement pulsed through the prisoners . The khata had scudded back over the ridge and was plummeting to the slope fifty feet in front of the road crew . The guards were among them now , cursing , reaching for their batons . As Trinle moved back from the edge , now watching the prayer cloth , Shan turned back to his upset wheelbarrow . Sergeant Feng , slow and grizzled but ever alert , stood beside the spilled rocks , writing in his tally book . Building roads was in the service of socialism . Abandoning one 's work was one more sin against the people . But as he plodded back to accept Feng 's wrath , a cry rang out from the slope above . Two prisoners had gone for the khata . They had reached the pile of rocks where it had landed but were on their knees now , backing away , chanting feverishly . Their mantra hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man dropped to his knees the instant he heard it , taking up the chant in succession until the entire brigade , all the way to the trucks at the bridge below , was chanting . Only Shan and four others , the sole Han Chinese prisoners in the brigade , remained standing . Feng roared in anger and shot forward , blowing his whistle . At first Shan was confused by the chant , for there had been no suicide . But the words were unmistakable . It was the invocation of Bardo , the opening recitation for the ceremonies of death . A soldier wearing four pockets on his jacket , the most common insignia of rank in the People 's Liberation Army , trotted uphill . Lieutenant Chang , the officer of the guard , spoke into Feng 's ear , and the sergeant shouted for the Han prisoners to clear the stack of rocks discovered by the Tibetans . Shan stumbled forward to where the khata lay and knelt beside Jilin , the slow , powerful Manchurian known only by the name of his province . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surly face took on an air of anticipation . With a surge of new energy he shoved aside the rocks . It was not unusual for the lead work team , assigned to clear the largest boulders and loose surface rocks , to encounter the unexpected . A discarded pot or the skull of a yak was often discovered along the routes surveyed by the engineers of the PLA . In a land where the dead were still offered to vultures , it was not uncommon even to encounter the shards of human beings . A half-smoked cigarette appeared in the rubble . As Jilin snatched it with a purr of delight , a pair of brightly polished boots appeared beside them . Shan leaned back on his haunches and watched as Lieutenant Chang 's expression changed to alarm . His hand jerked to the pistol at his belt . A shrill outburst died on his lips , and he stepped behind Feng . This time , the People 's 404th Construction Brigade had beaten the vultures . The body lay outlined by the rocks that had covered it . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather , in an expensive Western fashion . Under a red V-necked sweater , a freshly laundered white shirt glistened . " American , " Jilin whispered with awe , not for the dead but for the clothing . The man wore new blue jeansnot the flimsy Chinese denim for which street vendors sold pirated Western labels , but the real thing , made by a company in the United States . On the sweater was an enamel pin of two crossed flags , American and Chinese . The man 's hands were folded over his belly , giving the impression of someone lying in repose at a guesthouse , waiting to be called for tea . Lieutenant Chang quickly recovered . " The rest , dammit , " he snarled , shouldering Feng forward . " I want to see the face . " " An investigation , " Shan said without thinking . " You ca n't just " The lieutenant kicked Shan , not hard , but with the motion of one accustomed to dealing with troublesome dogs . Beside Shan , Jilin flinched , reflexively shielding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabbed the exposed ankles . With a peevish glance at Feng , he jerked the body away from the remaining rocks . Instantly the color drained from Chang 's face . He turned away and retched . The body had no head . " Idolatry is an attack on the socialist order , " a young officer barked into a bullhorn as the prisoners were marched toward a line of decrepit gray troop trucks long ago retired from army service . " Every prayer is a blow against the people . " Break the Chains of Feudalism , Shan silently bet to himself , or Honoring the Past Is Regression . " The dragon has eaten , " called out a voice from the ranks of prisoners . A whistle blew for silence . " You have failed to make quota , " the political officer continued in his high-pitched drone . Behind him was a red truck Shan had never before seen at the construction site . MINISTRY OF GEOLOGY , it said on the door . " You have shamed the people . You will be reported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the slope . Why , wondered Shan , would the Ministry of Geology need to be there ? " Visiting rights suspended . No hot tea for two weeks . Break the Chains of Feudalism . Learn the will of the people . " " Fuck me , " an unfamiliar voice muttered behind Shan . " Lao gai coffee again . " The man stumbled into Shan 's back as they waited to climb into the truck . Shan turned . It was a new face to the squad , a young Tibetan whose small rugged features marked him as a khampa , from the herding clans of the high Kham plateau to the east . As the man saw Shan his face instantly hardened . " You know lao gai coffee , your highness ? " he snarled . The few teeth he had left were blackened with decay . " A spoonful of good Tibetan dirt . And half a cup of piss . " The man sat on the bench opposite Shan and studied him . Shan turned the collar up on his shirtthe tattered canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield them from the windand returned the stare without blinking . Survival , he had learned , was all about managing fear . It might burn your stomach . It might sear into your heart until you felt your soul smoldering . But never let it show . Shan had become a connoisseur of fear , learning to appreciate its many textures and physical reactions . There was a vast difference , for example , between the fear of the torturer 's bootsteps and the fear of an avalanche descending on an adjacent work crew . And none compared to the fear that kept him awake nights as he searched through his miasma of exhaustion and pain , the fear of forgetting the face of his father . In the first days , during the haze of hypodermics and political therapy , he had come to realize how valuable fear could be . Sometimes only the fear had been real . The khampa had deep scars , blade marks , on his neck . His mouth curled with cold scorn as he spoke . " Colonel Tan , they said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one told me this was Tan 's district . From the Thumb Riots , right ? The biggest son of a bitch in an army of sons of bitches . " For a moment it seemed as though no one had heard , then a guard suddenly leaned through the flap and slammed his baton against the man 's shins . A grimace of pain twisted the khampa 's face , fading into a spiteful laugh as he made a small , twisting gesture toward Shan , as though with a knife . With studied disinterest , Shan shut his eyes . As the flap was tied shut behind them and the truck groaned into movement , a low murmur rose in the darkness . It was nearly imperceptible , like the sound of a distant stream . During the thirty-minute ride to their camp , the guards were in the truck cabs , and the prisoners were alone . The fatigue in the squad was almost palpable , a weary grayness that dulled the ride back to camp . But it did not relieve the men from their vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's malas , their rosaries , by sound . The man to his left fingered a chain of buttons . On his other side the bootleg mala was a chain of fingernails . It was a popular device : one let the nails grow , then clipped and collected them , until reaching the required one hundred and eight , on thread pulled from blankets . Some rosaries , made only of knots tied from such thread , moved silently through callused fingers . Others were made of melon seeds , a prized material that had to be carefully guarded . Some prisoners , though , especially the recent arrivals , were more concerned with the rituals of survival than the rituals of Buddha . They would eat such rosaries . With each seed or fingernail , knot or button , a priest recited the ancient mantra , Om mani padme hum . Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus , the invocation to the Buddha of Compassion . No priest would recline on his bunk until his daily regime of at least one hundred cycles was completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The priests and their mantras had changed his life . They had made it possible for him to leave behind the pain of his past , to stop looking back . At least , most of the time . An investigation , he had said to Chang . The words had surprised him more than they had the lieutenant . Old ways died hard . As fatigue pushed his consciousness back , an image pounced on him . A headless body , sitting upright , fidgeting with a gold cigarette lighter . The figure somehow took notice of him , and reluctantly extended the lighter toward Shan . He opened his eyes with a gasp , suddenly short of breath . It was not the khampa who was watching him now , but an older man , the only prisoner with a genuine rosary , an ancient mala of jade beads which had materialized months earlier . The man who used it sat diagonally across from Shan , with Trinle , on the bench behind the cab . His face was worn smooth as a cobblestone except for the ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked him with a hoe thirty years earlier . Choje Rinpoche had been the kenpo , the abbot , of Nambe gompa , one of the thousands of monasteries that had been annihilated by the Chinese . Now he was kenpo of the People 's 404th Construction Brigade . As Choje said his beads like the others , oblivious to the lurching of the truck , Trinle dropped a small object wrapped in a rag into his lap . Choje lowered his rosary and slowly unwrapped it , revealing a stone covered with a rust-colored stain . The old lama held it reverently , studying each facet , as if it held some hidden truth . Slowly , as he discovered its secret , a great sadness filled his eyes . The rock had been drenched with blood . He looked up and met Shan 's stare again , then nodded solemnly , as if to confirm Shan 's sense of foreboding . The man in the American jeans had lost his soul there , in the middle of their road . The Buddhists would refuse to work the mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rosaries disappeared . Whistles blew and the canvas was untied . Through the gray light of dusk the prisoners plodded in silence into the squat plank buildings that housed them , then quickly emerged with the tin mugs that served each man as wash basin , food plate , and teacup . They filed through one side of the mess shed to have their mugs filled with barley gruel and stood in the dusk , coming to life as the warmth of the gruel reached their bellies . Prisoners silently nodded to each other , offering tired smiles . If anyone spoke , he would be sent to the stable for the night . Back in the hut , Trinle stopped the new prisoner , the khampa , as he moved across the room . " Not here , " the monk said , pointing to a rectangle drawn in chalk on the floor . The wiry khampa , apparently familiar with the invisible altars of prison barracks , shrugged and moved around the rectangle to an empty bunk in the corner . " By the door , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipful tone , as though in awe of his every waking moment . " Your bunk would be by the door , " he repeated , and offered to move the man 's kit . The man seemed not to have heard . " Buddha 's breath ! " he gasped , studying Trinle 's hands . " Where 's your thumbs ? " Trinle cocked his head toward his hands . " I have no idea , " he said with a tinge of curiosity , as though he had never considered the question . " The bastards . They did it to you , did n't they ? To keep you from your rosary . " " I still manage . By the door , " Trinle repeated . " There 's two empty bunks , " the man snapped . He was no priest . He leaned back on the straw pallet as though challenging Trinle to move him . The fiercest resistance fighters ever to oppose the People 's Liberation Army had been those from Kham . They were still being arrested in the remote ranges for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern clans , who had resisted the army long after the rest of Tibet was subdued , was still prohibited from possessing any weapon , even a blade of more than five inches . The man removed one of his tattered boots and with great ceremony removed a slip of paper from his pocket . It was a sheet from one of the guards ' tally pads , which sometimes blew open in the wind . He held it up with an exaggerated smile and pushed it into his boot for added insulation . Life in the 404th was measured by the thinnest of victories . As he rewrapped the rags that served as his socks , the new arrival studied his cellmates . Shan had seen the routine more times than he could count . Each new prisoner first looked for the chief priest , then for the weak who would make no trouble . For those who had given up and those who could be informers . The first was easy . His eyes quickly settled on Choje , who sat lotus fashion on the floor beside one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . No one in the hut , no one in the entire lao gai brigade , emitted such serenity . One of the young monks produced a pocketful of leaves , sprouts of the weeds that had begun to emerge on the mountain slopes . Trinle counted them out and distributed them , one leaf to each prisoner . Each of the monks accepted his leaf solemnly and whispered a mantra of thanks toward the man whose turn it had been to risk punishment for gathering the greens . Trinle turned back to the khampa as the man chewed his leaf . " I am sorry , " he said . " Shan Tao Yun sleeps there . " The khampa looked about and settled his gaze on Shan , who sat on the floor near Choje . " The rice eater ? " he snarled . " No khampa lets a damned rice eater beat him . " He laughed and looked around . No one joined . The silence seemed to inflame him . " They took our land . They took our monasteries . Our parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks with growing impatience . The monks looked at each other uncomfortably . The hatred in his voice was like an alien presence in their hut . " And that was just the beginning , just giving them the time they needed for the real fight . Now they take our souls . They put their people in our cities , in our valleys , in our mountains . Even in our prisons . To poison us . To make us like them . Our souls shrivel up . Our faces disappear . We become nobody . " He turned abruptly to face the opposite bunks . " It happened at my last camp . They forgot all their mantras . One day they woke up , their minds were blank . No prayers left . " " They can never take the prayers from our hearts , " Trinle said , with an anxious look toward Shan . " Shit on them ! They take our hearts . No one passes on then , no one goes to Buddha . They only go down , drifting from one form to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , they fed him politics . One day he woke up and found he had been reborn as a goat . I saw him . The goat got in line for food , just where the old priest had been . I saw it with my own eyes . Just like that . A goat . The guards bayoneted him . Roasted him on a spit in front of us . Next day they brought a bucket of shit from the latrine . Said look what he 's become now . " " You do not need the Chinese to lose your way , " Choje said suddenly . " Your hate will be enough . " His voice was soft and fluid , like sand falling on a stone . The khampa shrank back . But the wildness stayed in his eyes . " I 'm not waking up as a damned goat . I 'll kill someone first , " he said , glaring again at Shan . " Shan Tao Yun , " Trinle observed quietly , " was reduced . He will return to his bunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A punishment , " Trinle replied . " No one explained the system ? " " They pushed me out of the truck and just gave me a shovel . " Trinle nodded to one of the young monks sitting nearby , a man with one milky eye who instantly dropped his prayer beads and moved to the khampa 's feet . " Break one of the warden 's rules , " the man explained , " and he sends you a clean shirt . You appear before him . If you are lucky , you are reduced . The immediate elimination of everything that provides comfort except the clothes on your back . The first night is spent outside , in the center of the assembly square . If it is winter you will leave your body that night . " In Shan 's three years he had seen six of them , carried away like altar statues , frozen in the lotus position , clutching their makeshift beads . " If it is not winter , the next day you may return to the shelter of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your coat . Next your food cup . Then the blanket , the pallet , and finally the bed . " " You said that 's the lucky . What about the others ? " The young priest suppressed a shudder . " The warden sends them to Colonel Tan . " " The famous Colonel Tan , " the khampa muttered , then abruptly looked up . " Why a clean shirt ? " " The warden is a fastidious man . " The priest looked back to Trinle as though uncertain what more to say . " Sometimes those who go are sent to a new place . " The khampa snorted as he recognized the hidden meaning of the priest 's words , then warily circled Shan . " He 's a spy . I can smell it . " Trinle sighed and picked up the khampa 's kit , moving it to the empty bunk by the door . " This one belonged to an old man from Shigatse . It was Shan who got him out . " " I figured he took four . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been a tax collector in the Dalai Lama 's government . Thirty-five years , then suddenly they call his name and open the gate . " " You said this rice-eater got him out . " " Shan wrote some words of power on a banner , " Choje interjected with a slow nod . The khampa studied Shan with a gaping mouth . " So you 're some kind of sorcerer ? " The venom was still in his eyes . " Gon na work some magic on me too , shaman ? " Shan did not look up . He watched Choje 's hands now . The evening liturgy would soon begin . Trinle turned with a sad smile . " For a sorcerer , " he sighed , " our Shan hauls rocks well . " The khampa muttered under his breath , and threw his boot to the bunk by the door . He was conceding not for Shan , but for the priests . To be certain , he turned to Shan . " Fuck your mother , " he grunted . When no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moved to the bare planks of Shan 's bunk , untied the string at his waist , and urinated on the boards . No one spoke . Choje slowly rose and began cleaning the bunk with his own blanket . The sheen of victory left the khampa 's face . He cursed under his breath , then , nudging Choje aside , pulled off his shirt and finished the job . There had been another khampa in their hut two years earlier , a tiny , middle-aged herder jailed for failing to register with one of the agricultural cooperatives . Alone for nearly fifteen years after a patrol picked up his family , he had finally wandered into a valley town after his dog died . He had been the closest thing to a caged animal Shan had ever seen , always pacing back and forth in the hut like a bear behind bars . When looking at Shan his face had been like a small fist clenched in fury . But the little khampa had loved Choje like a father . When one of the officers , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken his stick to Choje for spilling a barrow load , the khampa had leapt on the Stick 's back , pounding him , screaming profanity . The Stick had laughed and pretended not to notice . A week later , released from the stable with a limp from something they did to his knee , the khampa had ripped strips from his blanket and begun sewing pockets to the inside of his shirt . Trinle and others had told him that even if he stored up enough food in his new pockets for a flight across the mountains , it was futile to consider escape . One morning , when he had finished his pockets , he asked Choje for a special blessing . At their mountain worksite he began filling the pockets with rocks . He kept working , singing an old herder 's song , until Lieutenant Stick moved near the edge of the cliff . Then , without a second 's hesitation , the khampa had charged , hurling himself at the Stick , locking his arms and legs around the officer , using the extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night bell rang . The single naked bulb that lit the room was extinguished . No talking was permitted now . Slowly , like a chorus of crickets claiming the night , the liquid rattle of rosaries filled the hut . One of the young monks stealthfully moved to keep watch by the door . From a hiding place under a loose board Trinle produced two candles and lit them , placing them at either end of the rectangle of chalk . A third was placed in front of Choje . The flame was too dim even to reach the kenpo 's face . His hands appeared in the light , and began the evening teaching . It was a prison ritual , with no words and no music , one of the many that had evolved since Buddhist monks began filling Chinese prisons four decades earlier . First came the offerings to the invisible altar . Choje 's palms were pressed together facing outward , his index fingers curled under his thumbs . It was the sign for argham , water for the face . Many of the mudra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still eluded Shan , but Trinle had taught him the offering signs . The bottom two fingers of Choje 's disembodied hands withdrew into the palms and the hands aimed downward . Padyam . Water for the feet . Slowly , gracefully , Choje deftly moved his hands to offer incense , perfume , and food . Finally he closed his fists together , the thumbs extended upward like wicks from a bowl of butter . It was aloke . Lamps . From outside a long moan of pain punctuated the silence . A monk in the next hut was dying of some internal ailment . Choje 's hands gestured toward the invisible circle of worshipers , asking what they brought for the glory of the inner deity . A pair of thumbless hands appeared in the light , the index finger of each hand touching at the tip , the other fingers folded . A tiny murmur of approval moved through the room . It was the golden fish , an offering for good fortune . New hands appeared , each after sufficient time to silently recite the dedication prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasure flask , the coiled knot , the lotus flower . It was Shan 's turn . He hesitated , then extended his left index finger upward and covered it with his right hand flattened . The white umbrella , another prayer for good fortune . The room filled with the tiny , remarkable sound , as if of rustling feathers , that had become a fixture of Shan 's nights , the sound of a dozen men silently mouthing mantras . Choje 's hands returned to the circle of light for the sermon . He began with a gesture Shan had not often seen , the right hand raised with palm and fingers pointing up . The mudra of dispelling fear . It cast an uneasy silence on the room . One of the young monks audibly sucked in his stomach , as though suddenly aware that something profound was happening . Then the hands shifted , clasping together with the middle fingers pointing upward . The diamond of the mind mudra , invoking cleansing and clarity of purpose . This was the sermon . The hands did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pale granite , while the devotees contemplated them . The message could not have been more intensely communicated if Choje had shouted it from a mountaintop . The pain was irrelevant , the hands said . The rocks , the blisters , the broken bones were inconsequential . Remember your purpose . Honor your inner god . It was n't clarity that Shan lacked . Choje had taught him how to focus like no teacher before . Through the long winter days when the warden kept them innot for fear of losing prisoners , but for fear of losing guardsChoje had helped him reach an extraordinary discovery . To be an investigator , the only job Shan had ever known before the gulag , one had to have a troubled soul . The exceptional investigator could have no faith . Everything was suspect , everything transitory , moving from allegation to fact to cause to effect to new mystery . There could be no peace , for peace only came with faith . No , it was n't clarity he lacked . In moments like this , with dark premonition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man tangled in an anchor line , what he lacked was an inner god . He saw there was something on the floor below Choje 's hands . The bloody rock . With a start , Shan realized that he and Choje were thinking about the same thing . The kenpo was reminding his priests of their duty . Shan 's tongue went dry . He wanted to blurt out a protest , to beg them not to put themselves at risk over a dead foreigner , but the mudra silenced him like a spell . He clamped his eyes shut but still Shan could not focus on Choje 's message . He kept seeing something else each time he tried to concentrate . He kept seeing the gold cigarette lighter hanging five hundred feet above the valley floor . And the dead American who had beckoned to him in his daylight nightmare . Suddenly a low whistle came from the door . The candles were extinguished , and a moment later the ceiling light switched on . A guard slammed open the door and moved to the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind him came Lieutenant Chang . With mock solemnity Chang extended a piece of clothing so that no prisoner could mistake it . It was a clean shirt . He jabbed it toward several men as though feinting with a blade , laughing as he did so . Then he abruptly flung it at Shan , who lay on the floor . " Tomorrow morning , " he snapped , and marched out . * * * A sharp , chill wind slapped Shan 's face as Sergeant Feng escorted him through the wire the next morning . The winds were harsh to the 404th , which sat at the base of the northernmost ridge of the Dragon Claws , a vast rock wall rising nearly vertically behind it . Updrafts sometimes ripped roofs from huts . Downdrafts sometimes pelted them with gravel . " Already reduced , " Sergeant Feng muttered as he locked the gate behind them . " Nobody already reduced ever got the shirt . " He was a short , thick , bull of a man , with a heavy stomach and equally heavy shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from years of standing guard in sun and wind and snow . " Everyone 's waiting . Making bets , " Feng added with a dry croak Shan took to be a laugh . Shan tried to will himself not to listen , not to think of the stable , not to remember Zhong 's white-hot fury . Zhong 's temper was in control for once . But the warden 's gloating smile as he paced around Shan scared him more than the expected tantrum . He gripped his upper right arm , which often twitched in Zhong 's presence . Once they had connected battery wires there . " If he had bothered to consult with me , " Zhong said in the flat nasal tone of Fujian province , " I would have warned him . Now he will have to find out for himself what a damned troublemaker you are . " Zhong lifted a piece of paper from his desk and read it , shaking his head in disbelief . " Parasite , " he hissed , then paused and scribbled on the paper to record the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , looking up expectantly . " One wrong step and you 'll be breaking rocks with your bare hands . Until you die . " " I constantly endeavor to fulfill the trust the people have bestowed in me , " Shan said without blinking . The words seemed to please the warden . A perverse gleam rose on his face . " Tan 's going to eat you alive . " * * * Sergeant Feng had an unfamiliar look , an almost festive air about him . A drive into Lhadrung , the ancient market town that served as county seat , was a rare treat for the 404th guards . He joked about the old women and goats who ran from the side of the road , spooked by the truck . He peeled an apple and shared it with the driver , ignoring Shan , who was wedged between the two men . With a spiteful grin , he repeatedly moved the key for Shan 's manacles from one pocket to the next . " They say the chairman himself sent you here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings of the town came into view . Shan did n't reply . He bent in his seat trying to roll up his cuffs . Someone had produced a pair of worn , oversized gray trousers for him to wear , and a threadbare soldier 's jacket . They had made him change clothes in the middle of the office . Everyone had stopped his work to watch . " I mean , why else would they put you in with them ? " Shan straightened . " I 'm not the only Chinese . " Feng grunted as though amused . " Sure . Model citizens , every one . Jilin , he killed ten women . Public Security would have put a bullet in him except his uncle was a party secretary . That one from Squad Six , he stole the safety gear from an oil rig in the ocean . To sell in the black market . Storm came and fifty men died . Letting him have a bullet was too easy on him . Special cases , you from home . " " Every prisoner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People like you , Shan , they just keep for practice . " He stuffed two slices of apple into his mouth . Momo gyakpa , he was called behind his back , fat dumpling , for the curve of his belly and the way he was always scavenging food . Shan turned away . He looked over the expanse of heather and hills rolling like a sea toward the high ice-clad ranges . It offered the illusion of escape . Escape was always an illusion for those who had no place to escape to . Sparrows flitted among the heather . There were no birds at the 404th . Not all the prisoners were fastidious in respecting life . They claimed every crumb , every seed , nearly every insect . The year before there had been a fight over a partridge that was blown into the compound . The bird had narrowly escaped , leaving two men with a handful of feathers each . They had eaten the feathers . The four-story building that housed the government of Lhadrung County had a crumbling synthetic marble faade and filthy windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed Shan up the stairs to the top floor , where a small gray-haired woman led them to a waiting room with one large window and a door at each end . She scrutinized Shan with a twist of her head , like a curious bird , then barked at Feng , who shrank , then sullenly removed the manacles from Shan 's wrists and retreated into the hallway . " A few minutes , " she announced , nodding at the far door . " I could bring you tea . " Shan looked at her dumbfounded , knowing he should tell her of her mistake . He had not had tea , real green tea , for three years . His mouth opened but no sound came out . The woman smiled and disappeared behind the near door . Suddenly he was alone . The unexpected solitude , however brief , overwhelmed him . The imprisoned thief suddenly left alone in a treasure vault . For solitude had been his real crime during his years in Beijing , the one for which no one had ever thought to prosecute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his private apartment in the married quarters , his long solitary walks through the parks , the meditation cells at his hidden temple , even his irregular work hours had given him a hoard of privacy unknown to a billion of his countrymen . He had never understood his addiction until that wealth had been wrenched away by the Public Security Bureau three years before . It had n't been the loss of freedom that hurt most , but the loss of privacy . Once in a tamzing session at the 404th he had confessed his addiction . If he had not rejected the socialist bond , they said , there would have been someone there to stop him . It was n't friends that mattered . A good socialist had few friends , but many watchers . After the session he had stayed behind in the hut , missing a meal just to be alone . Discovering him there , Warden Zhong had dispatched him to the stable , where they broke something small in his foot , then forced him back to work before it could heal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling occupied one corner . It was dead . There was a small table , polished brightly , with a lace doily on top . The doily caught him by surprise . He stood before it with a sudden aching in his heart , then pulled himself away to the window . The top floor gave a view over most of the northern quarter of the valley , bound on the east by the Dragon Claws , the two huge symmetrical mountains from which ridges splayed out to the east , north , and south . The dragon had perched there and taken phantom form , people said , its feet turned to stone as a reminder that it still watched over the valley . What was it someone had shouted when the American 's body was found ? The dragon had eaten . He pieced together the geography until at last , across an expanse of several miles of windblown gravel and stunted vegetation he discerned the low roofs of Jade Spring Camp , the county 's primary military installation . Just above it , and below the northernmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wire-enclosed compound of the 404th . Almost without thinking Shan traced the roads , his work of the past three years . Tibet had two kinds of roads . The iron roads always came first . The 404th had laid the bed for the wide strip of macadam that ran from Lhasa , beyond the western hills , into Jade Spring Camp . Iron roads were not railways , of which Tibet had none . They were for tanks and trucks and fieldguns , the iron of the People 's Liberation Army . The thin line of brown that Shan traced from an intersection north of town toward the Claws was not such a road . It was far worse . The road the 404th was building now was for colonists who would settle in the high valleys beyond the mountains . The ultimate weapon wielded by Beijing had always been population . As in the western province of Xinjiang , the home of millions of Moslems belonging to central Asian cultures , Beijing was turning the native population of Tibet into a minority in their own lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Population centers in the rest of Tibet had been flooded with immigrants . Endless truck convoys over thirty years had turned Lhasa into a Han Chinese city . The roads built for such convoys were called avichi trails at the 404th , for the eighth level of hell , the hell reserved for those who would destroy Buddhism . A buzzer sounded . Shan turned to find the birdlike woman standing with a cup of tea . She extended the cup , then scurried through the far door , disappearing into a darkened room . He gulped down half the cup , ignoring the pain as it scalded his throat . The woman would realize her mistake and take it back . He wanted to remember the sensation , to relive the taste in his bunk that night . Even as he did so he felt demeaned , and angry at himself . It was a prisoner 's game that Choje warned against , stealing bits of the world to worship back in the hut . The woman reappeared and gestured for him to enter . A man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit by a single gooseneck lamp . No , it was not a desk , Shan realized , but an altar that had been converted to government use . The man silently studied Shan while lighting an expensive American cigarette . Loto gai . Camels . Shan saw the familiar hardness . Colonel Tan 's face looked like it had been chiseled out of cold flint . If they were to shake hands , Shan thought , Tan 's fingers would probably slice through his knuckles . Tan exhaled the smoke through his nose and looked at the teacup in Shan 's hands , then to the gray-haired woman . She turned to open the curtains . Shan did not need the sunlight to know what was on the walls . He had been in scores of such offices all over China . There would be a photograph of the rehabilitated Mao , pictures of military life , photos of a favorite command , a certificate of appointment , and at least one Party slogan . " Sit , " the colonel ordered , gesturing to a metal chair in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the walls . Mao was there , not the rehabilitated one but a photo from the sixties , one that showed the prominent mole on his chin . The certificate was there , and a photograph of grinning army officers . Above them was a picture of a nuclear missile draped with the Chinese flag . For a moment Shan did not see a slogan , then he saw a faded poster behind Tan . " Truth , " it said , " Is What the People Need . " Tan opened a thin , soiled folder and fixed Shan with an icy stare . " In Lhadrung County the state has entrusted the reeducation of nine hundred and eighteen prisoners to me . " He spoke with the smooth confident voice of one accustomed to always knowing more than his listeners . " Five lao gai hard labor brigades and two agricultural camps . " There was something Shan had not seen at first , fine wrinkles below the close-cropped graying hair , a trace of weariness around the mouth . " Nine hundred and seventeen have files . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , where each was first informed against , every word uttered against the state . But for the other one there is only a short memorandum from Beijing . Only a single page for you , prisoner Shan . " Tan folded his palms over the folder . " Here by special invitation of a member of the Politburo . Minister of the Economy Qin . Old Qin of the Eighth Route Army . Sole survivor of Mao 's appointees . Sentence indefinite . Criminal conspiracy . Nothing more . Conspiracy . " He pulled on the cigarette , studying Shan . " What was it ? " Shan held his hands together and stared at the floor . There were things far worse than the stable . Zhong did n't need Tan 's permission to send him to the stable . There were prisons where inmates never left their cells except in death . And for those whose ideas were truly infectious , there were secret medical research institutes run by Public Security Bureau doctors . " Conspiracy to assassinate ? Conspiracy to embezzle state funds ? To bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Qin not trust us with that information ? " " If this is some sort of tamzing , " Shan said impassively , " there should be witnesses . There are rules . " Tan 's head did not move , but his eyes shot up , transfixing Shan . " The conduct of struggle sessions is not one of my responsibilities , " he said acidly , and considered Shan in silence for a moment . " The day you arrived , Zhong sent your folder to me . I think it scared him . He watches you . " Tan gestured to a second folder , an inch thick . " Started his own file . Sends me reports on you . I did n't ask , he just started sending them . Results of tamzing sessions . Reports of work output . Why bother ? I asked him . You 're a phantom . You belong to Qin . " Shan gazed at the two folders , one with a single yellowed sheet , the other crammed with angry notes from an embittered jailkeeper . His life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teacup . " But then you asked to celebrate the chairman 's birthday . " He opened the second folder and read the top page . " Most creative . " He leaned back and watched the smoke wisping toward the ceiling . " Did you know that twenty-four hours after your banner we had handbills circulating in the marketplace ? In another day an anonymous petition appeared on my desk , with copies being passed around the streets . We had no choice . You gave us no choice . " Shan sighed and looked up . The mystery was over . Tan had decided he had not been punished sufficiently for his role in Lokesh 's release . " He had been imprisoned for thirty-five years . " Shan 's voice was little more than a whisper . " On holidays , " he said , not knowing why he felt the need to explain , " his wife would come and sit outside . " He decided to address Mao . " Not allowed closer than fifty feet , " he said to the photograph . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . For hours they just waved . " A narrow smile , as thin as a blade , appeared on Tan 's face . " You have balls , Comrade Prisoner Shan . " The colonel was mocking him . A prisoner did not deserve so hallowed a title as Comrade . " It was very clever . A letter would have been a disciplinary offense . If you had tried to shout it out you would have been beaten into silence . Your own petition would have been burned . " He inhaled deeply on his cigarette . " Still , you made Warden Zhong look like a fool . He will always hate you for it . He asked for your transfer out of the brigade . Said you were a saboteur of socialist relations . Could n't guarantee your safety . The guards were furious . An accident could happen to Minister Qin 's special guest . I said no . No transfer . No accident . " Shan looked into Tan 's eyes for the first time . Lhadrung was a gulag county , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was his embarrassment , not mine . Releasing the old man was the right thing . Gave him a double ration book . " Smoke drifted out of the colonel 's mouth . He shrugged as he caught Shan 's stare . " To correct the oversight . " Tan closed the folder . " Still , I grew curious about our mysterious guest . So political . So invisible . I wondered , should I worry about the next bomb you might throw our way ? " He took another drag on his cigarette . " I made my own inquiries in Beijing . No more information , they said at first . Qin was not available . In the hospital . No more data on Qin 's prisoner available . " Shan stiffened and looked back at the wall . The chairman seemed to be staring back now . " But it was a quiet week . My curiosity was aroused . I persisted . I discovered that the memo in the file was prepared by the headquarters of the Public Security Bureau . Not the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sentence was entered . Over nine hundred prisoners , only one has a file prepared by the Bureau 's Beijing office . I think we never appreciated just how special you are . " Shan stared into Tan 's eyes again . " There 's an American saying , " he said slowly . " Everyone is famous for fifteen minutes . " Tan froze . He cocked his head and continued to stare at Shan , as if he was n't sure he had heard right . The knife-edge smile slowly reappeared . There was a rustle of small feet behind Shan . " Madame Ko , " Tan said , the cold smile still on his face . " Our guest needs more tea . " The colonel was too old to be on the promotion lists , Shan decided . Even at his exalted level , a post in Tibet was a post in exile . " I found more about this mysterious Comrade Shan , " Tan continued , shifting into the third person . " He was a Model Worker in the Ministry of Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement of justice . He was offered Party membership , an extraordinary reward for someone halfway through his career . Then he did something even more extraordinary . He declined . A very complex man . " Shan sat . " We live in a complex world . " He saw that his hands , unconsciously , had made a mudra . Diamond of the mind . " Especially when you consider that his wife is a highly regarded Party member , a senior official in Chengdu . Former wife , I should say . " Shan looked up in alarm . " You did n't know ? " Tan asked with a satisfied smile . " Divorced you two years ago . Annulled , actually . Never lived together , she said . " " We " Shan 's mouth was suddenly bone-dry " we have a son . " Tan shrugged . " Like you said . It 's a complex world . " Shan closed his eyes to fight the sudden pain in his gut . They had finished the final chapter in their rewriting of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't that they were close . Shan and his son had spent maybe forty days together in the fifteen years since the boy was born . But one of the prisoner 's games he played was fantasizing about the relationship he might have someday with the boy , about somehow creating the sort of bond Shan had shared with his own father . He would lie awake , wondering where the boy might be , or what he would say when he met his father again . The imagined relationship had been one of Shan 's last slender reeds of hope . He pressed his palms against his temples and leaned over in his chair . When he opened his eyes Tan was staring at him with a pleased expression . " Your brigade found a body yesterday , " he said abruptly . " Lao gai prisoners , " Shan said woodenly , " are acquainted with death . " No doubt they had told the boy that Shan had died . But died how ? As a hero ? As a disgrace ? As a slave used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the smoke rise languidly to the ceiling . " Attrition in the work brigades is always to be expected . Finding a decapitated Western visitor is not . " Shan looked up , then turned away . He did not want to know . He did not want to ask . He stared into his cup . " You have confirmed his identity ? " " The sweater was cashmere , " Tan said . " Nearly two hundred American dollars in his shirt pocket . A business card for an American medical equipment firm . He must have been an unauthorized Western visitor . " " His skin was dark . Black hair on the body . Could have been Asian , even Chinese . " " A Chinese of such a rank ? He would have been missed . And there was the business card from an American company , " Tan reported victoriously . " The only Westerners allowed in Lhadrung are those operating our foreign investment project . They are too conspicuous not to be missed . In two more weeks American tour groups will begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cigarette one last time before crushing it out . " I am pleased to see your interest in the case . " Shan 's eyes drifted past Tan to the slogan . Truth Is What the People Need . It could be read more than one way . " Case ? " he asked . " There will have to be an inquest . A formal report . I am also responsible for judicial administration in Lhadrung County . " Shan considered whether the statement was intended as a threat . " My squad did not make the discovery , " he said tentatively . " If the prosecutor needs statements he should talk to the guards . They saw as much as we did . All I did was clear a few rocks . " He shifted to the edge of his seat . Could he have been called in error ? " The prosecutor is on a month 's leave in Dalian , on the coast . " " The wheels of justice are accustomed to moving slowly . " " Not this time . Not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Justice arriving the day before . Their first inspection in five years . An open death file could give the wrong impression . " A knot began to tie itself in Shan 's gut . " The prosecutor must have assistants . " " There is no one else . " Tan leaned back , studying Shan . " But you , Comrade Shan , were once the Inspector General of the Ministry of Economy . " There had been no mistake . Shan stood and moved to the window . The effort seemed to sap him of strength . He felt his knees shaking . " A long time ago , " he said at last . " A different life . " " You were responsible for compiling the two biggest corruption cases Beijing has ever known . In your time you sent dozens of party officials to hard labor camps . Or worse . Apparently there are some who still revere your name , even those who fear it . Someone in your old ministry said it was obvious why you were in prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some say you went to the West and you 're still there . " Shan stared out the window , seeing nothing . His hand was shaking . " Some say you went , and the Bureau brought you back because you knew too much . " " I was never a prosecutor , " Shan spoke toward the glass , his voice cracking . " I collected evidence . " " We 're too far from Beijing to split such fine hairs . I was an engineer , " Tan said to his back . " I commanded a missile base . Someone decided I was qualified to administer a county . " " I do n't understand , " Shan said hoarsely , leaning against the window , wondering if he could ever find strength again . " That was another life . I 'm not the same man . " " Your entire career was spent as an investigator . Three years is not so long . " " Someone could be brought in . " " No . That might demonstrate a certain ... " Tan searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But my file , " Shan protested . " I have been proven ... " His words drifted away . He pressed his hands against the glass . He could break it and jump . If your soul was in perfect balance , Choje said , you would just float away to another world . " Proven what ? A thorn in Zhong 's side ? I grant you that . " Tan opened the thick file and rifled through the papers . " I 'd also say you have proven yourself shrewd . Methodical . Responsible , in your own way . And a survivor . For men like you , surviving is the supreme skill . " Shan did not have to ask what Tan meant . He stared into his callused bone-hard hands . " I have been warned against regression , " he protested . " I am a road laborer . I am supposed to think in new ways . I build for the prosperity of the people . " It was the last refuge of the weak . When in doubt , speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , political officers would have no work , " Tan observed . " Failure to confront the past , that is the real sin . I want you to confront yours . Let the inspector live again . For a short while . I do not know the words the Ministry expects . I do not speak the language . No one here does . I want a file prepared that can be quickly closed . I am without the benefit of the prosecutor 's thinking . It is not something I will discuss with him on the phone two thousand miles away . I need the matter framed in terms the Ministry of Justice understands . Terms that will not attract further scrutiny . I wager you still have the Beijing tongue . " Shan sank into the chair . " You ca n't do this . " " It 's not much I 'm asking , " Tan said with false warmth . " Not a full investigation . A report to support the death certificate . Explaining the likely accident that led to such an unfortunate demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tan gestured toward Zhong 's file . " You could use a friend . " " Must have been a meteorite , " Shan muttered . " Excellent ! Precisely what I mean . With that kind of thinking we can wrap this up in a day or two . We will think of an appropriate reward . Say , extra rations . Light duties . Assignment to a repair shop , perhaps . " " I wo n't , " Shan said in a very still voice . " I mean , I can not . " Amusement lifted Tan 's face . " On what grounds do you refuse , Comrade Prisoner ? " Shan did not reply . On the grounds that I can not lie for you , he wanted to say . On the grounds that my soul has been worn to a few thin threads by people like you . On the grounds that the last time I tried to find the truth for someone like you I was sent to the gulag for my trouble . " Perhaps you have been confused by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberation Army . I am a party member of rank seventeen . This district belongs to me . I am responsible for educating the people , feeding the hungry , constructing civil works , removal of waste , custody of prisoners , supervision of cultural activities , movement of the public buses , storage of communal food . And eradication of pests . Of any variety . Do you understand me ? " " It is impossible . " Tan slowly drained his tea and shrugged . " Still , you are not permitted to refuse . "
