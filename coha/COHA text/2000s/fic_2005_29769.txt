Chapter One It was just after sunrise and still raining when Lily found her husband 's body . He was lying faceup on the asphalt apron in front of the greenhouse , eyes and mouth open , collecting rainwater . Even dead , he looked quite handsome in this position , gravity pulling back the loose , wrinkled skin of his face , smoothing away eighty-four years of pain and smiles and worries . Lily stood over him for a moment , wincing when the raindrops plopped noisily onto his eyes . I hate eyedrops . Morey , hold still . Stop blinking . Stop blinking , she says , while she pours chemicals into my eyes . Hush . It 's not chemicals . Natural tears , see ? It says so right on the bottle . You expect a blind man to read ? A little grain of sand in your eye and suddenly you 're blind . Big tough guy . And they 're not natural tears . What do they do ? Go to funerals and hold little bottles under crying people ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's false advertising , is what it is . These are unnatural tears . A little bottle of lies . Shut up , old man . This is the thing , Lily . Nothing should pretend to be what it 's not . Everything should have a big label that says what it is so there 's no confusion . Like the fertilizer we used on the bedding plants that year that killed all our ladybugs , what was it called ? Plant So Green . Right . So it should have been called Plant So Green Ladybug So Dead . Forget the tiny print on the back you ca n't read . Real truth in labeling , that 's what we need . This is a good rule . God should follow such a rule . Morey ! What can I say ? He made a big mistake there . Would it have been such a problem for Him to make things look like what they are ? I mean , He 's God , right ? This is something He could do . Think about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great smile and nice face and you let him in and he kills your whole family . This is God 's mistake . Evil should look evil . Then you do n't let it in . You , of all people , should know it 's not that simple . It 's exactly that simple . Lily took a breath , then sat on her heels-a young posture for such an old woman , but her knees were still good , still strong and flexible . She could n't get Morey 's eyes to close all the way , and with them open only a slit , he looked sinister . It was the first thing that had frightened Lily in a very long time . She would n't look at them as she pushed back the darkened silver hair the rain had plastered to his skull . One of her fingers slipped into a hole on the side of his head and she froze . " Oh , no , " she whispered , then rose quickly , wiping her fingers on her overalls . " I told you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " I told you so . " Chapter Two April in Minnesota was always unpredictable , but once every decade or so , it got downright sadistic , fluctuating wildly between tantalizing promises of spring and the last , angry death throes of a stubborn winter that had no intention of going quietly . It had been just such a year . Last week , a freak snowstorm had blustered in on what had been the warmest April on record , scaring the hell out of the budding trees and launching statewide discussions of a mass migration to Florida . But spring had eventually prevailed , and right now she was busy playing kiss-and-make-up , and doing a damn fine job of it . The mercury was pushing seventy-five , the snow-stunned flora had rallied with a shameless explosion of neon green , and best of all , the mother lode of mosquito larvae was still percolating in the lakes and swamps . Giddy , sun-starved Minnesotans were out in force , cherishing the temporary delusion that the state was actually habitable . Detective Leo Magozzi was stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper in one hand , a mug of coffee in the other . He had n't forgotten about last week 's snowstorm and he was pragmatic enough to know that it was n't too late for another , but there was no point in letting cynicism ruin a perfectly beautiful day . Besides , it was a rare thing when he could practice the sloth he 'd always aspired to-homicide detectives ' vacations were always contingent on murderers ' vacations , and murderers seemed to be the hardest-working citizens in the country . But for some inexplicable reason , Minneapolis was enjoying the longest murder-free spell in years . As his partner , Gino Rolseth , had put it so eloquently : Homicide was dead . For the past few months they 'd had nothing to do but work cold cases , and if they ever solved all of them , they 'd be back on the beat , frisking transvestites and wishing they 'd been dentists instead of cops . Magozzi sipped his coffee and watched as the neighborhood masochists engaged in all manner of personal torture , huffing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock that would have them locked indoors again in a few months ' time . They jogged , they Rollerbladed , they ran with their dogs , and celebrated every degree that rose on the thermometer by shedding another article of clothing . It was one of the things Magozzi loved most about Minnesotans . Fat , thin , muscled , or flabby , there were no self-conscious people in this state when the weather got warm , and by the time you got a nice day like this one , most of them were half naked . Of course this was not always a good thing , certainly not in the case of Jim , his extremely hirsute next-door neighbor . You could never be really sure if Jim were wearing a shirt or not . He was out there now , possibly shirtless , possibly not , hard at work preparing the flower beds that would put him in pole position for next month 's Beautiful Gardens of the Twin Cities Tour . If Jim was trying to shame Magozzi into being a better homeowner , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry excuse for a yard-a couple of mud puddles from last night 's rain , some brave dandelions , and a few blue spruce in various stages of demise . Occasionally he had a fleeting memory of what the place had looked like before the divorce . Flowers everywhere , Kentucky bluegrass standing at attention , and Heather out there each day with sharp instruments and a stern expression , frightening plants into submission . She 'd been good at frightening things into submission-it had certainly worked on him , and he 'd been armed . He was on his second cup of coffee and almost to the sports section when a Volvo station wagon pulled into the driveway . Gino Rolseth hopped out , lugging an enormous cooler and a bag of Kingsford . His belly tested the generous limits of a Tommy Bahama shirt , and beefy legs poked out from a terrible pair of plaid Bermuda shorts . " Hey , Leo ! " He lumbered up onto the porch and dropped the cooler . " I come bearing gifts of animal flesh and fermented grain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning ? Tell me this means Angela finally kicked your sorry ass out , so I can call her and propose . " " You should be so lucky . This is charity . Angela 's folks took her and the kids to some craft thing at Maplewood Mall , so I had a free Sunday , thought I 'd liven up your so-called life . " Magozzi got up and looked into the cooler . " What 's a craft thing ? " " You know , those places with all the booths where people knit houses out of old grocery bags and stuff like that . " Magozzi rummaged in the cooler and pulled out a package of sickly-looking , plump , gray-white sausages . " What are these things that look like your legs ? " " Those are uncooked brats , imported all the way from Milwaukee , you food pygmy . Where 's your grill ? " Magozzi gestured toward a rusty old Weber in the corner of the porch . Gino nudged it with his foot and it collapsed . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious-looking , dark orange brick of cheese . " Twelve-year cheddar ? Is that legal ? " Gino grinned . " That stuff 'll make you weep with joy , I promise . Got it at a great little cheese house in Door County . Somebody forgot about a wheel in the cellar and found it twelve years later , covered in about a foot of mold . Nirvana , my friend . Pure nirvana . It 's amazing what a cow and some bacteria can do . " Magozzi sniffed it and cringed . " Oh yeah . Every time I see a cow I think , Hey , would n't it be great to get some bacteria and really do something with this thing . Why do you have a file folder in the cooler ? " " It 's a cold case . " " Very funny . " Gino lifted the grill and another leg fell off in a shower of rust . " This one 's from ninety-four . Thought we could take a look at it later . You know , just to keep our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this town again . You remember hearing anything about the Valensky case ? " Magozzi sat down on the chaise and opened the folder . " Sort of . The plumber , right ? " " That 's the one . Shot seven times , three of them in places I do n't even want to think about . " " Plumbers charge too much . " " Tell me about it . But other than that , this guy was damn near a candidate for sainthood . Some Polack who actually made it out of the war alive , emigrated to the good old U. S. of A. , started a business , married , had three kids , deacon at his church , scout leader , the whole American dream , then bled to death on his own bathroom floor after someone used him for target practice . " " Suspects ? " " Hell no . According to the reports in there , everybody loved him . Case dried up in about two seconds . " Magozzi grunted and tossed the folder on the floor . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , like sit on a bench at Lake Calhoun and count bikinis . " " Yeah , well , I 'm a crime fighter , I have a higher purpose . " Gino ran a hand through his hedge of closely cropped blond hair , reconsidering . " Besides , it 's probably too early for bikinis . " They got the call before Magozzi had finished duct-taping the legs back on his grill . Gino had gone inside to unload the cooler , and when he came back out to the porch he was beaming . " Hey , want to go see a body ? " Magozzi sat back on his heels and frowned . " You found a body in my kitchen ? " " Nah . Phone rang while I was in there , so I picked up . Dispatch got an honest-to-God homicide call . Uptown Nursery . The owner 's wife found him this morning by one of the greenhouses and figured it was a heart attack , because the guy is pushing eighty-five and what else would drop a man that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullet hole in the guy 's head and calls nine-one-one . " Magozzi looked wistfully at the grill and sighed . " So what happened to the on-duty guys who are supposed to be taking this ? " " Tinker and Peterson . Just what I wanted to know . They just took a call at the train yard over in Northeast . Found some poor bastard tied to the tracks . " Magozzi winced . " Nah , do n't worry . Train never hit him . " " So he 's okay ? " " Nope , he 's dead . " Magozzi looked at him expectantly . " Do n't look at me . That 's all I got . " He jumped when his shirt pocket spit out an irritating , tinny version of Beethoven 's Fifth . " What is that ? " Gino pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and stabbed viciously at buttons half the size of his chubby fingers . " Goddamnit . Helen keeps programming in all these weird rings ' cause she knows I got no clue how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's funny . " Beethoven spoke again . " Fourteen-year-olds are only funny when they belong to somebody else ... shit . I 'm gon na invent one of these things with big fat buttons and make a jillion dollars ... Hello , this is Rolseth . " Magozzi stood and brushed the rust off his hands , listened to Gino grunt into the phone for a few seconds , then went inside to lock up . By the time he got back out to the porch , Gino had retrieved his gun from the car and was hooking it to the belt that almost held up his Bermuda shorts . He looked like an armed and dangerous tourist . " I do n't suppose you 've got a pair of pants that would fit me . " Magozzi just smiled at him . " Aw , shut up . That was Langer on the phone . He and McLaren just got called in for a suspected homicide-'suspected ' meaning someone did a little interior design with a few gallons of blood , but there 's no body . And guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nah , Dispatch told him we were on the nursery thing , that 's why he called . The bloody house is just a few blocks over . " Magozzi frowned . " That 's a pretty decent neighborhood . " " Right . Not exactly a killing field , and all of a sudden we 've got two possibles in one day . And there 's another thing . The guy who lives in that house is-or was-also in his eighties , just like our guy . " Magozzi thought about that for a minute . " He 's thinking cluster ? What , that some psycho 's running around killing old people ? " Gino shrugged . " He was just giving us a heads-up . Thought we should keep in touch in case something clicks . " Magozzi sighed , looked longingly at the Weber . " So we 're back in business . " " Big-time . " Gino paused for a moment . " You ever think there 's something wrong with a job where you only have something to do if someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chapter Three Marty Pullman was sitting on the closed toilet lid in his downstairs bathroom , staring down the muzzle of a .357 Magnum . The round black hole looked very large , which worried him . Worse yet , the toilet faced the big mirror on the sliding doors that enclosed the bathtub , and he was n't too keen on watching his own snuff film . He thought about it for a minute , then got into the bathtub and slid the doors closed behind him . He smiled a little as he aimed the shower nozzle toward the back of the tub and turned the spray on full blast . He may have made a mess of his life , but he sure as hell was n't going to make a mess of his death . Finally satisfied , he sat down in the tub and put the muzzle in his mouth . Water poured over his head , his clothes , his shoes . He hesitated for just a few seconds , wondering again what , if anything , he 'd done last night . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thumb through the trigger guard . " Mr. Pullman ? " Marty froze , his thumb quivering on the trigger . Goddamn it , he was hallucinating . He had to be . No one ever came to this house , and certainly no one would just let himself in-except maybe a Jehovah 's Witness , which made him glad he had the gun . " Mr. Pullman ? " The male voice was louder now , closer , and he sounded young . " Are you in there , sir ? " A forceful knock rattled the bathroom door in its frame . The gun tasted terrible as he pulled it from his mouth , and he spat into the water swirling toward the drain . " Who is it ? " he shouted , trying his best to sound scary and aggressive . " Sorry to disturb you , Mr. Pullman , but Mrs. Gilbert told me to break the door down if I had to ... " Continues ...                   @ @
