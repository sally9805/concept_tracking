Chapter One THE BLOCK ESTATE MASSIE 'S BEDROOM Saturday , January 24th 7:00 PM " Done , done , and done . " Massie Block stretched out her arms so she looked like the letter T , then collapsed face first onto the fluffy purple duvet cover on her bed . Goosedown feathers puffed up around her like a taco shell when she landed , and she could feel her aching legs throbbing to the beat of her pounding heart . Who knew putting twenty-six Christmas presents away could be harder on the body than an eight-hour shopping spree on Fifth Avenue ? After a brief moment of peace , Massie 's amber eyes popped open and filled with panic . " Ehmagod , Bean , what have I done ? " She beckoned to her black pug . " Now my sheets are all messy . " Massie used her last bits of arm strength to push herself off the bed , and once she was standing on her white sheepskin rug , she smoothed her hand over the duvet and pulled each corner so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it dangled off her bracelet and dragged across the purple cotton . It was a Christmas gift from Claire . And Massie legitimately liked it . " It has double meaning , " Claire had said as she 'd handed Massie the square-shaped red metallic box on Christmas day . " It 's a Leo , ' cause that 's your birth sign . And since it 's a lion , like my last name , you 'll always remember who gave it to you . " Massie remembered how her stomach had churned after Claire said that . It had reminded her that the Lyons were about to move to Chicago . And Claire 's bright , innocent smile made it obvious that she still had no clue . Now that the holidays were over and school was about to start up again , Jay Lyons was finally going to break the news to his only daughter . Massie checked the stainless steel face of her new Coach watch with the dyed mahogany calf-hair strap . In one hour Claire would know everything . Massie shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the Claire situation cloud the moment . There would be plenty of time for sadness later . So instead , she put her hands on her hips and admired her work . " Bean , I do n't know what gift I ah-dore more . " Massie 's puppy was curled up in her new doggie bunk bed , fighting to keep her tired eyes open . " My new Bean mannequin or my Gossip Girl collection ? They are both so ah-mazing . " Every year for Christmas Massie got a new mannequin that had been custom made to her exact size . It was the perfect way for her to try on different outfits without having to get undressed and mess up her hair . Right now , her mannequin was wrapped in three different Dixons-the colored mesh tubes that she 'd gotten as a special gift from the Teen People fashion editors . The gift had been their way of saying thank-you for modeling in their holiday issue . And Massie could n't have been happier . She had already thought of thirty-seven ways to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd think of more . But Massie was n't the only girl with her own mannequin . This year Santa had gotten one for Bean too . The spongy foam dog was dressed in a maroon cable knit wool sweater , tiny beige Ugg boots , and a cashmere scarf covered in different-colored pom-poms . It was tonight 's aprs-dinner walk ensemble . Bean had picked it out herself . To the right of the mannequins , beside Massie 's closet door , was a long mirrored shelf lined with twenty-two different tubes of lip gloss . Now that she was a member of the Gossip Girl club , a fresh exotic flavor arrived at her doorstep every morning . Candy Apple was the latest addition . And it was delicious . Her enormous walk-in closet was stuffed with colorful stacks of cashmere sweaters that she 'd bought in Aspen and four new pairs of jeans . She 'd even managed to add seven new rhinestone brooches to her current collection , which brought her total up to twenty-four and pretty much guaranteed her title of Girl with the Most Brooches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer creative brilliance , Massie had stuck them to a red corkboard above her desk so they would sparkle over her head while she did her homework , like constellations made of jewels . Yes , Massie was ready for the new semester . She sat down at her desk and switched on her new Power Mac G5 computer . It was time she shared her " In " and " Out " lists with the public by turning them into a blog . What better way to help losers keep track of the latest trends ? It was all part of her New Year 's resolution to make the world a better place . Massie smiled to herself while the G5 's hard drive booted up . She was making a difference . The instant Massie was online , a barrage of " welcome back " instant messages popped up on her screen . She clicked on Alicia Rivera 's first . HOLAGURRL : HOW WZ ASPEN ? MASSIEKUR : GR8 . AH-MAZING SNOW . HOW WZ SPAIN ? HOLAGURRL : LOCO . Massie rolled her eyes . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted Spanish . She spoke with a Spanish accent and overused words like loco and amigo . Thankfully , by midweek she 'd remember she was 100 percent American and return to normal . HOLAGURRL : MY 13-YR-OLD COUSIN NINA CAME BACK WITH US . SHE 'S GOING 2 SPEND THE SEMESTER @ OCD . WE R HAVING A WELCOME 2 WESTCHESTER FIESTA 4 HER 2MORROW NIGHT . EVERY 1 IS INVITED . BRIARWOOD BYZ 2 ! Massie felt the bottoms of her feet tingle when she read , " Briarwood boys . " The Briarwood Academy was known for two things : its soccer team and ah-dorable boys . And her latest crush , Derrick Harrington-or Derrington , as she secretly liked to call him-happened to be a star in both categories . And if she remembered correctly , Alicia 's cousin Nina would not be a threat . Massie had seen enough Nina pictures over the years to know that the girl was a full-fledged LBR-Loser Beyond Repair . Her clothes were totally Sears . And her hair was overprocessed and underconditioned . She looked like a " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year older than Massie , so chances were their paths would n't cross . There was nothing worse than being seen with a dorky foreign exchange student . It was popularity poison . Ding . An IM from Kristen Gregory . SEXYSPORTSBABE : HOWZ YOUR ASPEN J ? MASSIEKUR : HA HA ! SEXYSPORTSBABE : SOOO BORING HERE W/O U. MASSIEKUR : HOW R U ? SEXYSPORTSBABE : BALD . MASSIEKUR : ? ? ? SEXYSPORTSBABE : MOM MADE ME GO 2 SUPERCUTS . THEY SCALPED ME . I 'M WEARING MY GRANDFATHER 'S FEDORA . GOT ANY COOL CAPS ? MASSIEKUR : NO WAY ! CAPS ARE OUT . SEXYSPORTSBABE : SO IS LOOKING LIKE RYAN SEACREST . MASSIEKUR : SEACREST OUT ! SEXYSPORTSBABE : SO NOT FUNNY ! Next , Massie clicked on Dylan Marvil 's IM . BIGREDHEAD : I GAINED 3 LBS OVER BREAK . AM FATTER THAN SANTA . MASSIEKUR : ? ? ? ? BIGREDHEAD : THE FOOD IN TONGA SUCKED . THE ONLY THING TO EAT ON THE ISLAND WAS FRIES W/ TARTAR SAUCE . UNLESS OF COURSE YOU LIKE FISH WITH THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : THIS YEARZ GON NA SUCK . I THINK I CAUGHT A COLD ON THE PLANE . SICK PEOPLE SHOULD NOT B ALLOWED IN 1st CLASS . MASSIEKUR : AGREED . BIGREDHEAD : COULD B WORSE . I COULD B CLAIRE . HOW DID SHE TAKE THE NEWS ABOUT CHICAGO ? MASSIEKUR : SHHHHH ! SHE DOES N'T KNOW YET . Massie was interrupted by Kristen 's IM response . SEXYSPORTSBABE : BTW , HOW DID CLAIRE TAKE THE NEWS ? She was interrupted again by Alicia 's . HOLAGURRL : DID CLAIRE MOVE TO CHICAGO YET ? MASSIEKUR : I 'M CALLING YOU . The three pea-sized silver bells that hung from Massie 's cell phone antenna clanged together as she speed-dialed her best friends . This conversation was way too classified for IM . " Are you insane ? " Massie barked once all four girls were on the phone . " Claire could have been sitting right beside me . " She looked to make sure her door was closed before continuing . " I told you never to talk about Claire and Chicago until the story goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What ? " The rest of them said . " That 's a word jumble , " Kristen said , as though it were obvious . " I was so bored over Christmas break I finished eleven word jumble books . I like them much better than crossword puzzles . " " Sorry ! " Alicia shouted . Massie flicked one of the bell charms with her thumb . " Huh ? " " Rorsy is word jumble for sorry , " Alicia insisted . Massie could practically hear her proud smile through the phone , her perfect white teeth gleaming and winkling against her tanned skin . " Wait , so does this mean Claire still does n't know she 's moving to Chicago ? " Dylan asked . Massie sighed . " Yup . " " On yaw ! " Kristen said . " Yes way ! " Massie replied as quickly as she could . Alicia was n't the only one who could speak jumble . " Mr. Lyons is breaking it to the families tonight at my dad 's country club . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Claire 's younger brother , Todd , feeds me secret information . All I had to do was buy him the new Atari Anthology . Now he tells me everything he overhears . " " No fair , I want a Todd , " Alicia whined . " I 'm your Todd , " Massie said . " Gawd , how did you keep the secret the whole time you were in Aspen together ? " Kristen asked . " You two are sooo close . I thought it would have slipped out eventually . " " It was n't easy , " Massie explained , ignoring Kristen 's sarcasm . " But I did n't want to ruin her trip . " " Awww , how sweet of you , " Dylan cooed insincerely . Then her tone became stern and serious . " But maybe she 'd be better off in Chicago . And then things could finally get back to normal around here . " " Yeah , " Kristen said . Massie ran her fingers through her dark glossy hair and sighed . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she knew the answer . " Nothing , " Alicia said , trying to keep the peace . " They 're not saying anything . " " Listen , " Massie said , " the Lyons have been living in my guesthouse since September , and it 's pretty much sucked . No one knows that more than you guys . And now that Claire and I have finally decided to stop making each other miserable , you 're all upset . I do n't get it . I thought you 'd be happy for me . " " We 're glad you 're not making each other miserable , but did you have to become BFFs ? " Dylan said , and then blew her nose . It was obvious Kristen , Dylan , and Alicia were jealous . And Massie was n't in the mood to deal . She took a deep breath and , when she exhaled , let all of her friend-stress go . The last few months had been so full of fighting , and Massie desperately wanted the new year to be fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Got ta go , " she whispered . " Was it something we said ? " Alicia sounded genuinely concerned . " No . Claire 's here . " " Shocker , " Dylan said under her breath . " She 's always there , " Kristen said before hanging up . Massie snapped her phone shut and quickly shut off her computer . " Come in . " Claire pushed the door open but stayed in the hallway . She widened her big blue eyes and opened her mouth . She looked like a shocked emoticon . " I ca n't believe my eyes . " " Me either , " Massie said to Claire 's shoes . " Are you really wearing those to the High Hills Country Club tonight ? " " I thought you 'd like my new camo high-tops . " Claire stuck out her right leg and pointed her toes like a ballerina . " They 're Converse , not Keds . " " I know what they are . " Massie raised her eyes , scanning Claire 's faded high-waisted Gap jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I knew you 'd like them . " Claire smiled . " I e-mailed a picture of them to Cam and he said he got the exact same pair over break . I swear sometimes I think we 're more like twins than boyfriend and girlfriend . " " So , are you and Cam Fisher officially boyfriend and girlfriend now ? " Massie asked casually . She did n't want Claire to know how much that news shocked her . But how could it not ? Claire actually had a real boyfriend before she did . That was not supposed to happen . " Yeah , he just asked me . " Claire blushed . " It was so cute-he sent me an Evite inviting me to be his girlfriend . " Massie pretended to be distracted by a piece of lint on the sleeve of her tweed blazer . Claire giggled softly , then said , " I RSVP 'd ' yes . ' " Massie looked up . " That 's great . " She forced herself to smile . " But that still does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers to a country club . " Claire rolled her eyes and smiled . Massie was tempted to say she would n't use those shoes to scoop up Bean 's poo . But she could n't be mean . Not tonight . " Your room looks ah-mazing . " Claire changed the subject . Massie giggled when she heard Claire using one of her expressions . After all , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery . " Thanks . Wan na see all my new clothes ? " Massie waved her arms in the air like a game-show hostess . " Uh , sure . " But she was staring at Massie 's Gossip Girl collection . " Feel free to wear whatever you want to the club tonight . " Massie pushed her closet door and it popped open . She tugged on the purple feather boa that hung from the light switch in the middle of the ceiling and a warm orange light lit the inside , triggering a disco ball that automatically started spinning , sending white , swirling squares across the walls . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection . " More like Bergdorf 's . Here . " Massie yanked a caramel colored cashmere cowl-neck sweater off a hanger and draped it over Claire 's shoulder . Then she grabbed her dark Juicy Couture jeans and a pair of two-inch teal round-toe Marc Jacobs boots . " Wear this . And cuff the jeans so the boots show . " " Why are you letting me wear your new clothes ? " " The club has a dress code . " Claire held the jeans in her arms and crinkled her eyebrows . " What is it ? " " Cool , " Massie said with a playful smile . Claire giggled and shrugged . Before she slid off her jeans , Claire emptied her pockets . " Want one ? " She dangled a clear plastic bag in front of Massie 's face . Tangles of oily gummy worms were stuck together in a sweaty clump . " Uh , okay , " Massie said , making every effort to be nice . " Really ? " Claire pulled the bag away . " But you hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Massie said , reaching for it . " Remember all of those mints I stole from the front desk at the ski lodge ? " The girls started cracking up when they remembered how stuffed Massie 's pockets had been . She 'd barely been able to walk . " Yeah , but you did n't eat those ; we threw them off the chair lifts . " Claire laughed . " I ate a few . " Massie dug her hand into the bag . It was humid inside . She would n't have felt any more disgusted if the worms had been real . " Oh , here . " Claire tossed her digital camera to Massie . " What 's this camera for ? " " I thought we could download the pictures from our trip onto your new computer . " Claire fell backward onto Massie 's bed . She was struggling to fasten the jeans . " Uh , can you ... ? " Massie was about to ask Claire to get off her bed , but it was too late . The duvet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ones to Cam . " Claire sounded like she had just been punched in the stomach , until she finally closed the jeans . " I want to show him what a good time we had in Aspen . We should send some to Derrington too . " Massie 's stomach flip-flopped when she heard Derrington 's name . No matter how hard she tried , she had n't been able to stop thinking about Derrington over break , and she wondered if he missed her half as much . He 'd popped into her head as she was opening presents on Christmas day and while she was skiing moguls in Aspen . Massie had no idea why she was crushing so hard on a guy who wore shorts in the winter and insisted on wiggling his bare butt in public at least three times a week . Yes , his shaggy blond hair and sparkly brown eyes made him cuter than the majority of the Briarwood boys , and yes , he was the most valued player on their soccer team , but it was more than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd exchanged the Diesel jeans Massie had bought him for Christmas and gotten two pairs of cargo shorts instead . On one hand it was rude , but on the other it was kind of cool . Derrington was the only person Massie had ever met who was n't afraid of her . And that made Massie a little afraid of him , in a good way . " I 'll need time to Photoshop them . I 'm not sending anything unless we look ah-mazing . " " Fine with me , " Claire agreed as she pulled the cowl neck sweater over her head . Kendra Block 's pinched voice bleated over the white intercom on Massie 's bedside table . " Girls , we 're leaving for the club in five minutes , " she said . " ' Kay , Mom , " Massie yelled to the white box . " I wonder what my dad 's big surprise is . " Claire smiled and bit her bottom lip . She leaned against Massie 's desk and slid on the teal boots . Her face looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down to zip them up . " I bet he wants to celebrate my first A ever in Spanish . Or maybe we 're finally trading in that Ford Taurus for a new car . " ( Continues ... )
