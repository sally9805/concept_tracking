Chapter One Ilna could see her reflection in the silvered backplate of the man who 'd been her childhood friend Garric , the innkeeper 's son-but who now was Prince Garric of Haft , the King of the Isles in all but name . He was speaking to his fiance and secretary , Lady Liane bos-Benliman , as she jotted notes onto a thin board with a small gold pen . As she watched , Ilna 's fingers knotted and unknotted patterns from the lengths of cord that she kept in her left sleeve . The patterns were simple , as simple as so many knives ; and like knives , they could be tools or weapons if the need arose . Ilna 's reflection was distorted , of course . She smiled-not bitterly , or at any rate without any more bitterness than her usual expression . Ilna prided herself on clear thinking , but there 'd been a great deal of distortion in her view of her possible future a few years ago when she lived in the backwater of Barca 's Hamlet on the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that she 'd make a suitable wife for her neighbor Garric . " Easy ! " bellowed the sailing master , leaning out from the pintle of the port steering oar . The Shepherd of the Isles was backing toward the beach on the reversed strokes of only one of its five banks of oars . " Easy ! Easy ! " " Now you see why the men who are n't needed on the oars crowd into the bow , child , " said Chalcus at Ilna 's side . He held her ward , the nine-year-old Lady Merota , on his shoulder . " With their weight in the bow , we can back up onto the beach instead of crunching into it . " " Crowd more , you mean ! " said Merota . " Will we have real rooms here , Chalcus ? " " Depending on the words our friend the Prince has with the Earl of Sandrakkan , " Chalcus said laughing , " we 'll have rooms or at least ground to pitch a tent on , I 'm sure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets , but I 'll grant that with four hundred souls aboard you could find more room in a clothes press . " Chalcus dressed in as many different bright colors as a clown and had a clown 's smile and cheerful laughter . As he spoke , he gestured with his free hand to point out this or that part of the business of landing which only an expert would see . He was indeed an expert sailor . He 'd learned his skill in the same hard school that taught him to use the slim , in-curved sword he carried stuck through his sash of vivid orange silk . As a youth he 'd roamed southern waters with the Lataaene pirates , where the wrong choice meant death and the right choice did n't guarantee survival . Under his long-sleeved saffron tunic and his red-dyed leather breeches , Chalcus ' body bore the scars of wounds that should have been fatal a dozen times over . That he 'd survived said as much for his will as it did for the undoubted strength of his tautly muscular body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as amazing as that seemed to an illiterate peasant girl . Chalcus was her friend and her lover and ... well , not her man , because he was n't the sort to be anybody 's man save his own , but a man ; and even at age nineteen Ilna was aware of how rare a thing real men were in this world . Ilna 's fingers wove , then opened the coarse fabrics to weave again . She 'd always had a skill with cloth . She could run her hand over a bale of wool and hear it murmuring of meadows and clover , of the brook south of Barca 's Hamlet and the insistent warmth of the lamb nuzzling your udder . Then she 'd made a mistake , a wrong turning that took her to Hell and brought her knowledge fit only for demons . She 'd returned to the waking world without leaving Hell , becoming Evil 's most skillful minion for a time . It had n't been long by most reckonings , but Ilna knew that if she lived forever she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a mettlesome horse . " Here we go , child , " Chalcus said in an eager voice . The Shepherd scrunched onto the sand , beginning to wobble as it ground to a halt . The officers wore broad leather belts over their short tunics instead of sashes or simply breechclouts like the oarsmen who came from Shengy , Sirimat , and perhaps a few of the other southern islands . They shouted a confused medley of orders , but so far as Ilna could see the crew was already in motion . Sailors from the lower oarbanks stepped to the outriggers , leaped into the sea , and splashed shoreward carrying ropes . Those from the top bank had already withdrawn their oars from the rowlocks on the outrigger ; they thrust the blades down into the sand , bracing the vessel which for the moment rested only on its narrow keel . " Put your backs into it , Shepherds ! " Chalcus shouted as though he was still a sailor instead of being one of Prince Garric 's companions . His right arm pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship of Admiral Zettin , the fleet commander . " You 're not going to let those scuts from the City of Valles berth ahead of us , are you ? " Ilna 's brother Cashel stood across the narrow deck from her , one hand on his hickory quarterstaff and the other on the waist of his fiance Sharina-Princess Sharina of Haft and Garric 's sister . She was lovely and blond-haired and tall ; taller than most men in Barca 's Hamlet , though a hand 's breadth shorter than Cashel and with a willowy suppleness that made her seem tiny beside him . Cashel was a massive oak of a man , his neck a pyramid of muscle rising from his massive shoulders . He looked anxious . Ilna knew his concern was n't about what was happening , just that he was n't part of it . For choice Cashel would be down in the surf , gripping a hawser and helping drag the Shepherd up the beach with the strength of any three other men . He could n't do that because he 'd become Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest friend during the time they both were peasants growing up in Barca 's Hamlet . If he jumped into the water and grabbed a rope , the officers would be embarrassed and the common sailors shocked and worried ; so he did n't , because the last thing Cashel would willingly do was to hurt or embarrass anybody unnecessarily . Of course when he thought it was necessary , Cashel 's iron-bound hickory quarterstaff could do quite a lot of hurting . Seated cross-legged on the deck between Cashel , Sharina , and the railing was Tenoctris , an old woman whose talents included being generally cheerful despite the things she 'd seen in her long life . Here she 'd drawn a figure on the deck planking with a stick of red lead . She was muttering the words of a spell as she gestured with a thin split of bamboo . Tenoctris was a wizard . A wizard of slight power , she repeatedly noted , even now that the forces on which the cosmos turned were reaching another thousand-year peak , but a person whose craftsmanship had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anything that she did n't mean it to do . At a time when the hedge wizards of a decade ago could rip mountains apart-generally by accident-Tenoctris ' care and scholarship had a great deal to do with the kingdom 's survival . With the Shepherd firmly aground , the men from the lowest oarbank came up from the hold , sweating like plowmen . They stepped onto the outriggers . Many of them poised there a moment instead of dropping immediately to the sand into the knee-deep water nearer the stern . They 'd backed the great warship onto the beach by themselves , while the men of the other four oarbanks stood on deck to slant the stern into the air . Though the deck gratings had been removed before the vessel began these final maneuvers , there 'd still been very little ventilation in the hollow of the hull . The largest stern anchor was a stone doughnut attached to a section of cypress . The trunk was reeved through the central hole , and the three branches spreading just below the stone were trimmed to points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors lifted the anchor from where it 'd been stowed beneath the tiller of the starboard steering oar and walked to the rail . The sailing master leaned over the side and shouted , " Ware below ! " then nodded to the sailors . They half-dropped , half-threw the anchor onto the sand . " Chalcus ? " said Merota . She pointed toward the strait separating the little islet where they were landing from the mainland of Sandrakkan . " Why are those ships there still rowing ? Is n't there room for them here ? " The child 's high , clear voice cut through the scores of male shouts and snarls . For some reason , people always sounded angry at times like this . Maybe they were angry , frustrated by the complexity of what was going on . For complex it was . Ilna could n't count beyond the number of her fingers without beans or pebbles for a tally , but she knew that there was a ten of tens of ships in Garric 's fleet , the royal fleet-and perhaps several tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of The Shepherd of the Isles ; others had anchored well out in the channel , sending the soldiers they carried to land in small boats . In a few cases swimmers had dragged lines from vessels to the islet and tied them to the columns of ruined mansions lining the shore . Tunic-clad skirmishers armed with javelins and a hatchet or long knife clung to the lines with one hand as they splashed to land , safe even if they were n't able to swim any better than Ilna herself could . " Sandrakkan has n't any real fighting ships , dear one , " Chalcus said , speaking to the child on his shoulder but pitching his voice so that Ilna could hear also if she wanted to . " Just some fifty-oared patrol boats to chase smugglers , you see . But somebody had the notion , Lord Attaper I should n't wonder , that even little ships might attack Prince Garric while he 's all tangled up with landing . " Chalcus laughed . " Attaper is a fine man , to be sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest a stone fall out of the clear sky and strike the Prince down . Regardless , there 's thirty triremes sloshing the sea between Garric and the mainland . It 's good practice , I 'm sure , and there 's never a crew that would n't benefit from a little more practice . " Ilna allowed herself a slight smile at Chalcus ' description of the commander of Garric 's bodyguards , the Blood Eagles . Attaper was a fit , powerful man in his forties . At the moment he stood watchfully just behind the Prince . Ilna was sure he was ready to react if Lady Liane tried to stab Garric with the nib of her pen . Ilna 's fingers knotted a tracery of cords , then undid them before their pattern was quite complete . Had she finished the design , a man who saw it clearly would hurl himself away , shrieking and trying to claw the horror out of his eyesockets . She did n't need such a thing here and now ; but it was available , like the warships patrolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The equipment of all the Blood Eagles was blackened bronze , but Attaper 's helmet and cuirass had been chased with gold so that they looked more like parade armor than anything meant for war . His swordhilt , though , had the yellow patina that ivory takes when a hand grips it daily at the practice butts if not to wield against living foes . Ilna could n't fathom the minds of men who made it their life 's work to kill other men-and that was what soldiers did , when you boiled away all the nonsense about duty and courage and honor put on the business by the Old Kingdom poets that Garric so fancied . She could n't understand , but she knew craftsmanship and honored it above all other things . Craftsmanship meant doing a thing the single right way instead of any of the unnumbered wrong ways others might do it . The Blood Eagles were volunteers , veterans who 'd proved themselves in other regiments before they were even permitted to join . By the standard of craft , the only standard that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of her respect . Lord Waldron , commander of the Royal Army , stood on the stern of another five-banked warship backed onto the beach a few places down from The Shepherd of the Isles . His aide raised a silver trumpet and blew a ringing note that was answered a moment later by the deeper , richer calls of several curved horns from the shore . The troops who 'd already landed were milling like ants from a stirred-up hill , an image of hopeless chaos . But it was n't chaos , Ilna knew . Those scrambling troops were forming shoulder to shoulder with their fellows , under the standards of their proper units . Many were soaked to the waist and some had lost their shield or spear or helmet in the process of coming ashore , but even so they were an army rather than a mob . Sailors were bracing the Shepherd 's hull upright with spars so that the crewmen who 'd steadied her when she first grounded could ship their oars and jump down . Half a dozen men under a bosun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the ship even if an unexpected storm raced down the strait . Ilna knotted her pattern , shaking her head in marvel at the scene around her . It was as if every thread in a loom had its own mind , but they chose to weave themselves into a complex tapestry instead of twisting off each in its own direction . It was a marvelous thing , but she did n't understand it , did n't understand how it could even be possible . Chalcus and Merota laughed at some joke Ilna had missed in her reverie . She smiled also , though at a thought of her own . Ilna understood very little about the world in which she found herself living . No doubt people like Garric and Sharina , whose father had educated them far beyond the standards of Barca 's Hamlet , understood more than she did , but she was sure that even their grasp was slight compared with the world 's enormous complexity . Still Garric and Sharina and the others went on , guiding a kingdom through the darkness of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , the uncounted numbers of ordinary peasants and traders and fishermen-would surely be crushed into the mud by masterless chaos . Ilna did n't really believe in Good personified , but she had no doubt of the existence of Evil . So she 'd act to help Garric and Sharina , Tenoctris and Attaper and yes , Liane-the people who knew more than she did . She 'd act without hope , without real certainty except in one thing : that whatever Ilna os-Kenset did , she would do with all the skill at her disposal . Cashel looked over his shoulder . He gave Ilna the broad smile that was as much a part of him as cold stiffness was to Ilna 's own lips . Ilna 's fingers made a last knot ; she raised the completed pattern into the air . Everyone who caught sight of it laughed and pointed it out to their neighbors . It was only a rough , knotted fabric , but it brought a flash of joy and hope . Even to the woman who 'd knotted it .
