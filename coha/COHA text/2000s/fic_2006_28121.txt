Chapter One THE CRIME SCENE was in the low 30s around E , on the edge of Fort Dupont Park , in a neighborhood known as Greenway , in the 6th District section of Southeast D.C. A girl of fourteen lay in the grass on the side of a community vegetable garden that was blind to the residents whose yards backed up to the nearby woods . There were colorful beads in her braided hair . She appeared to have died from a single gunshot wound to the head . A middle-aged homicide police was down on one knee beside her , staring at her as if he were waiting for her to awake . His name was T. C. Cook . He was a sergeant with twenty-four years on the force , and he was thinking . His thoughts were not optimistic . There was no visible blood on or around the girl , with the exception of the entrance and exit wounds , now congealed . No blood at all on her shirt , jeans , or sneakers , all of which looked to be brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her murder , and her body had been moved and dumped here . He had a sick feeling in his gut and also , he realized with some degree of guilt , a quickening in his pulse that suggested , if not excitement , then engagement . An ID on the body would confirm it , but Cook suspected that this one was like the others . She was one of them . The Mobile CrimeLab had arrived . The techs were going through the motions , but there was a kind of listlessness in their movements and a general air of defeat . The transportation of a body away from the murder site meant that there would be few forensic clues . Also , it had rained . When this happened , it was said by some techs that the killer was laughing . On the edge of the crime scene were a meat wagon and several patrol cars and uniformed officers who had responded to the call for assistance . There were a couple dozen spectators as well . Yellow tape had been strung , and the uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and away from the homicide cops and lab techs doing their jobs . Superintendent of Detectives Michael Messina and Homicide Captain Arnold Bellows had ducked the tape and were talking to each other , leaving Sergeant Cook alone . The public-relations officer , a moley Italian American who appeared frequently on TV , fed the usual to a reporter from Channel 4 , a man with suspicious hair whose gimmick was a clipped delivery and dramatic pauses between sentences . Two of the uniformed officers stood by their cruiser . Their names were Gus Ramone and Dan Holiday . Ramone was of medium height and build . Holiday was taller and blade thin . Both were college dropouts , single , in their early twenties , and white . Both were in their second year on the force , past their rookie status but not seasoned . They had already acquired a distrust of officers above the rank of sergeant but were not yet cynical about the job . " Look at ' em , " said Holiday , nodding his sharp chin in the direction of Superintendent Messina and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T.C. " " They 're just letting him do his thing , " said Ramone . " The white shirts are afraid of him , is what it is . " T. C. Cook was an average-sized black man in a tan raincoat with a zip-in lining , worn over a houndstooth sport jacket . His dress Stetson , light brown with a chocolate band holding a small multicolored feather , was cocked just so , covering a bald head sided by clown patches of black hair flecked with gray . He had a bulbous nose and a thick brown mustache . His mouth rarely turned up in a smile , but his eyes sometimes shone brightly with amusement . " The Mission Man , " said Holiday . " The brass do n't like him , but they sure do n't fuck with him . Guy 's got a ninety percent closure rate ; he can do what he wants . " That 's Holiday all over , thought Ramone . Get results , and all will be forgiven . Produce , and do whatever the fuck you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay safe , put in your twenty-five and move on . He was not enamored of Cook or any of the other mavericks , cowboys , and assorted living legends on the force . Romanticizing the work could not elevate it to something it was not . This was a job , not a calling . Holiday , on the other hand , was living a dream , had lead in his pencil , and was jacked up big on the Twenty-third Psalm . Holiday had started on foot patrol in the H Street corridor of Northeast , a white man solo in a black section of town . He had cut it fine and already had a rep . Holiday remembered the names of folks he had met only one time , complimented the young women and the grandmothers alike , could talk Interhigh sports , the Redskins , and the Bullets with guys sitting on their front porches and those hanging outside the liquor stores , could even shoot the shit with the young ones he knew were headed for the hard side . Citizens , criminal and straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still they liked him . His enthusiasm and natural fit for the job would probably get him further in the MPD than Ramone would go . That is , if that little man with the pitchfork , sitting on Holiday 's shoulder , did n't ruin him first . Ramone and Holiday had gone through the academy together , but they were n't friends . They were n't even partners . They were sharing a car because there had been a shortage of cruisers in the lot behind the 6D station . Six hours into a four-to-midnight , and Ramone was already tired of Holiday 's voice . Some cops liked the company , and the backup , even if it was less than stellar . Ramone preferred to ride alone . " I tell you about this girl I been seein ? " said Holiday . " Yeah , " said Ramone . Not yeah with a question mark on the end of it , but yeah with a period , as in , end of discussion . " She 's a Redskinette , " said Holiday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know what they are . " " I tell you about her ? " " I think you did . " " You oughtta see her ass , Giuseppe . " Ramone 's mother , when she was angry or sentimental , was the only one who ever called him by his given name . That is , until Holiday had seen Ramone 's driver 's license . Holiday also occasionally called him " the Ramone , " after having had a look at Ramone 's record collection on the single occasion Ramone had let him into his apartment . That had been a mistake . " Nice ones , too , " said Holiday , doing the arthritic thing with his hands . " She got those big pink , whaddaya call ' em , aureoles . " Holiday turned , his face catching the strobe of the cruiser light bars still activated at the scene . He was smiling his large row of straight white teeth , his ice blue eyes catching the flash . The ID bar on his chest read " D. Holiday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doc " within the department . Coincidentally , he was as angular and bone skinny as the tubercular gunman . Some of the older cops claimed he looked like a young Dan Duryea . " You told me , " said Ramone for the third time . " Okay . But listen to this . Last week , I 'm out with her in a bar . The Constable , down on Eighth ... " " I know the place . " Ramone had gone to the Constable many times , pre-cop , in that year when he thought of himself as In Between . You could score coke from the bartender there , watch the band , Tiny Desk Unit or the Insect Surfers or whoever , in that back room , or sit under the stars on the patio they had out back , drink beers and catch cigarettes behind the shake , and talk to the girls , back when they were all wearing the heavy mascara and the fishnets . This was after his fourth , and last , semester at Maryland , when he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need any more of this desk-and-blackboard bullshit ; I can do this thing right now . But then just wandering for a while before he signed up , hitting the bars , smoking weed , and doing a little blow , chasing those girls with the fishnets . It had felt to him then like he was stumbling . Tonight , wearing the blue , the badge and gun , standing next to a guy he would have ridiculed a few years back , now his contemporary , it felt like he had been free . " ... and she drops a bomb on me . Tells me she likes me and all that bulljive , but she 's dating one of the Redskins , too . " " Joe Jacoby ? " said Ramone , side-glancing Holiday . " Nah , not that beast . " " So who ? " " A receiver . And not Donnie Warren , if you catch my drift . " " You 're saying she 's dating a black receiver . " " One of ' em , " said Holiday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who does n't , " said Ramone . Over the crackle of the radios coming from the cars they heard Cook telling one of the men in his squad to keep the Channel 4 reporter , who was attempting to move under the tape , away from the deceased . " Punk motherfucker , " said Cook , saying it loud , making sure the reporter could hear . " He 's the one got that witness killed down in Congress Park . Goes on the air and talks about how a young lady 's about to give testimony ... " " I had a problem with what she told me , I got ta be honest , " said Holiday , watching Cook but going ahead with his story . " ' Cause he 's black . " " I ca n't lie . It was hard for me to forget him and her after that . When I was in the rack with her , is what I 'm talkin about . " " You felt , what , inadequate or somethin ? " " Come on . Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm out a foot from his groin . " Guy 's got ta be like this . " " It 's an NFL requirement . " " Huh ? " " They check their teeth , too . " " I 'm sayin , I 'm just an average guy . Down there , I mean . Do n't get me wrong ; it 's Kielbasa Street when the blood gets to it , but when it 's just layin there- " " What 's your point ? " " Knowin this girl was hanging off the end of this guy 's dick , it just ruined her for me , I guess . " " So you what , let her go ? " " Not with that ass of hers , I was n't gon na let her go . No , sir . " A woman had wandered under the tape while they were talking , and as she approached the body of the girl and got a look at it , she vomited voluminously into the grass . Sergeant Cook removed his hat , ran a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stetson on his head , adjusted it , and allowed his eyes to search the perimeter of the scene . He turned to the man beside him , a white detective named Chip Rogers , and pointed to Ramone and Holiday . " Tell those white boys to do their jobs , " said Cook . " People regurgitatin , fucking up my crime scene ... If they ca n't keep these folks back , find some men who will . I 'm not playin . " Ramone and Holiday immediately went to the yellow tape , turned their backs to it , and affected a pose of authority . Holiday spread his feet and looped his fingers through his utility belt , unfazed by Cook 's words . Ramone 's jaw tightened as he felt a twinge of anger at being called a white boy by the homicide cop . He had heard it occasionally growing up outside D.C. and many times while playing baseball and basketball in the city proper . He did n't like it . He knew it was meant to cut him and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more . " How about you ? " said Holiday . " How ' bout me what ? " said Ramone . " You been gettin any hay for your donkey ? " Ramone did not answer . He had his eye on one woman in particular , a cop , God help him . But he had learned not to let Holiday into his personal world . " C'm on , brother , " said Holiday . " I showed you mine , now you show me yours . You got someone in your gun sights ? " " Your baby sister , " said Ramone . Holiday 's mouth fell open and his eyes flared . " My sister died of leukemia when she was eleven years old , you piece a shit . " Ramone looked away . For a while there was only the squawk and hiss of the police radios and the low conversations of the spectators in the crowd . Then Holiday cackled and slapped Ramone on the back . " I 'm kiddin you , Giuseppe . Oh , Christ , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been matched to a list of missing teenagers in the area . A half hour later , a man was brought to the scene to identify her . As he looked at the body , a father 's anguished howl filled the night . The victim 's name was Eve Drake . In the past year , two other black teenagers , both living in the poorer sections of town , had been murdered and dumped in similar fashion in community gardens , both discovered shortly after sunrise . Shot in the head , both had traces of semen in their rectums . Their names were Otto Williams and Ava Simmons . Like Otto and Ava , Drake 's first name , Eve , was spelled the same way backward as it was forward . The press had made the connection and dubbed the events the Palindrome Murders . Within the department , some police had begun to refer to the perpetrator as the Night Gardener . ACROSS TOWN , AT THE same time the father cried out over his daughter 's body , young Washingtonians were in their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coke as they watched the exploits of two hip undercover cops and their quest to take down the kingpins of the drug trade . Others read bestselling novels by Tom Clancy , John Jakes , Stephen King , and Peter Straub , or sat in bars and talked about the fading play-off prospects of the Jay Schroeder-led Washington Redskins . Others watched rented VCR tapes of Beverly Hills Cop and Code of Silence , the top picks that week at Erol 's Video Club , or barely sweated to Jane Fonda 's Workout , or went out and caught the new Michael J. Fox at the Circle Avalon or Caligula at the Georgetown . Mr. Mister and Midge Ure were in town , playing the clubs . As these movers of the Reagan generation entertained themselves west of Rock Creek Park and in the suburbs , detectives and techs worked at a crime scene at 33rd and E , in the neighborhood of Greenway , in Southeast D.C. They could not know that this would be the last victim of the Palindrome Killer . For now , there was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , somewhere , doing the murders . On a cool rainy night in December 1985 , two young uniformed police and a middle-aged homicide detective were on the scene . ( Continues ... )
