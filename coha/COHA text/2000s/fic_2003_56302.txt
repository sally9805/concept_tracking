The people who performed the brief transit were Lydia Webster Chase and Enzo Augusto Capellino . <p> 2 Enzo Capellino was a tailor and Lydia Chase was the daughter of Prescott Chase , a retired professor of botany at Harvard University . Enzo and Lydia knew of each other only because her father had his shirts and suits made in Capellino 's shop . One day in 1908 , while being fitted for a summer-weight linen suit jacket , Professor Chase happened to make small talk about gardening . Now , young Enzo Capellino was an avid gardener and he invited the professor to walk through the sunny patch he cultivated behind his shop . Old Professor Chase was delighted by this tangled paradise of Sicilian fruit trees , grapevines , and vegetables , and in return he invited Mr. Capellino to visit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ferns and fish pools , gravel walks and willow trees which lay behind his large square house on Kirkland Street . <p> In the years that followed , the elderly professor and the young tailor visited each other 's gardens once every June , exchanging seeds and cuttings . A certain decorum clothed these visits , partly because Professor Chase had been taught to treat social inferiors with polite formality and partly because Mr. Capellino had been taught to show deference to his elders , and the professor was clearly a generation older . <p> 3 In May of 1927 the professor 's daughter , Lydia Chase , visited the tailor 's shop for the first time , bringing with her the measurements for her father 's summer shirts . Enzo looked up from his cutting table that day and saw a tall , slender woman dressed in white , a beautiful woman with a distracted look about her . She moved with an elegant awkwardness , as if  --  as if  --  as if , he thought , she were a large-winged crane or snowy egret , a creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for air would be her natural element , not earth . Enzo himself was so distracted by her that it was not until after she left that he looked at the measurements she had given him . He saw that they were much shrunken from a year ago . <p> Miss Chase returned to Mr. Capellino 's shop a few weeks later to pick up the shirts . Enzo understood from the terribly diminished measurements that the professor , her father , was very sick . He wanted to solace Miss Chase , who was clearly even more distracted than before , but found that all he could say was , " I hope Professor Chase is well . " To which Lydia replied , " Thank you . " She flushed slightly , hesitated as if to say something more , then turned and left the shop , bumping ever so slightly into the door on her way out . <p> 4 Prescott Chase , Harvard Professor Emeritus of botany , veteran of the Civil War , died in December of 1927 at the age of eighty-four , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auburn Cemetery . Prescott 's old friends had already died or were ailing and housebound , and Christ Church , though small , looked quite empty . Lydia 's women friends attended the service , as did five of the professor 's former students and the President of the Charles Downing Horticulture Society . After the service , as Lydia followed the coffin past the empty pews , she noticed a solitary man standing halfway to the back of the church . He was of medium height , or somewhat shorter , and he was gazing at her with enormously sad , sympathetic eyes . It was not until she was home and had closed the door behind her that Lydia remembered him as the tailor , Mr. Capellino , upon which she suddenly burst into tears . <p> 5 Lydia 's friends visited her regularly that December , but by the last week of January , 1928 , the only visitor she had was a librarian from Harvard who had asked to examine her father 's books and papers to see if there was anything valuable she could donate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of Mr. Capellino refused to abandon Lydia 's memory , so in February she visited his shop . He was even shorter and darker than she had recalled , and the shop more cluttered . But when he stepped forward to greet her he smiled , his face lighting up so much at the sight of her that she forgot what she had planned to say and fumbled with pleasantries about the weather . As for the weather , sleet and freezing rain had kept everyone else at home , so the shop was empty . Lydia recovered herself and said she hoped Mr. Capellino could help her choose a necktie as a gift . Enzo explained that he had no neckties . <p> " No neckties ? " she echoed , glancing about with a worried look . <p> " Please make yourself comfortable , Miss Chase , " he said . ' I ' 11 make tea . " <p> Lydia sat in a chair beside the cutting table and removed her gloves . Enzo brought out a ceramic tea service whose brightly painted teapot was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ago and my father needed somebody , needed me , to take care of the house , take care of him and the house , " Lydia blurted out , as if she had been asked . <p> " I understand , " Enzo replied gently , pouring tea . " I was eighteen when my father died . I had to take over the shop to help my mother and to make dowries for my two younger sisters . My sisters married seventeen years ago , and my mother died three years ago , and here I am today . " <p> Lydia nervously twisted her gloves in her lap and wondered what to say next . " You garden on summer evenings , " she ventured . <p> " And I read on winter nights , " Enzo said . <p> After a moment she asked , " Have you ever wished to escape time , Mr. Capellino , so as to change your life ? " <p> " Often , " he said , looking up at her . <p> " Would you change things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not change the past , only the future , " he said . <p> " Somebody should build a time machine to go to the future , " Lydia said , smiling for the first time . <p> Enzo was enchanted by her smile . " I will do that , " he told her . <p> 7 One afternoon Enzo looked up from his jumbled cutting table and there was Lydia , standing tall in the middle of the shop . Snowflakes melting on her black cloche hat and on her long black coat gave her the appearance of  --  the appearance of  --  Yes ! Enzo thought , the appearance of the night sky clothed with stars . She asked Mr. Capellino for help in choosing a pair of gentleman 's leather gloves . He explained that he did n't carry gloves . " No gloves ? " Lydia said , looking about vaguely . <p> " No one will be coming here in this blizzard , " Enzo said , quickly bringing out a painted coffee pot shaped like a rooster . " Please make yourself comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored pot when Lydia asked him , " Have you thought about the time machine ? " <p> " I 've thought about it for years . " <p> " How would it work ? " she asked . <p> " Einstein has written about the fabric of space-time , " he began . <p> " Einstein ? The fabric of space-time ? " <p> Enzo set down the pot . " Those are his words , yes . And I wondered about this fabric . He said it was curved , and I know something about fitting pieces of flat fabric over a curved surface . And as I thought about it , evening after evening , I came to see that the past is like a tightly woven bolt of cloth , endlessly wide and endlessly long and endlessly deep . " <p> " And the future ? " <p> " The future is being woven in this passing instant , right now . When we say now we refer to the edge where the threads are being brought together . A time machine will permit us to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thread 's breadth ahead of now . And once there , we can weave life any which way we want , to please ourselves . " He had never felt so confident and he broke into a smile . <p> Lydia had discovered she deeply enjoyed talking this kind of nonsense with Mr. Capellino . " And what would it take to leap the distance of one thread ahead of now ? " she asked with a smile . <p> " A lightning bolt , " he said , laughing for the delight he saw in her face . <p> Lydia stayed talking with Enzo rather longer than the last visit and enjoyed herself more than she had in a long time . <p> 8 The next time Lydia and Enzo met , a gust of wind blew Lydia 's umbrella inside out just as she came in the door . She was gasping for breath and her face was drenched with rain . Enzo produced a dazzling white handkerchief and dabbed gently at her cheeks , but after three dabs the couple became embarrassed at how close they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her umbrella while Lydia composed herself . She asked did he have any books , and Enzo laughed and answered no , no books , only men 's clothing . <p> " The man who came from Harvard is cataloging my father 's library and putting all the books in order , " she said , looking around as if seeing the shop for the first time . " He 's very good at making things neat and orderly . Perhaps you could use  --  " <p> But Enzo interrupted to tell her , " They are like diamonds in your hair , those raindrops . " That was the first time he had ever said anything like that , and he was as surprised as Lydia by his boldness . He went off and returned with a tray and two glasses . " A little sweet wine from before Prohibition , " he explained . <p> Lydia sipped from her glass , coughed and put her hand to her chest as the wine went down . " How would one get a lightning bolt ? " she asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that possible ? " <p> " Yes , certainly . Before my parents immigrated to this country they lived in Palermo and saw Augusto Righi demonstrate his lightning machine at the University . My father was very impressed by Righi . He saw the demonstration twice and told me about it many times . My middle name , Augusto , is after Augusto Righi . " <p> " The . machine made lightning bolts ? " Lydia asked , beginning to smile . <p> " Little lightning bolts , yes . Or , as you might say , very large sparks . " Enzo , too , began to smile . <p> " How would one make a time machine ? " <p> " It 's the same as with making a suit . First I make the pattern , then I make the finished suit  --  or in this case , the machine . " <p> " But how does it work ? I mean , how does lightning make the time machine possible ? " <p> " The lightning bolt makes a tiny rip in the fabric of space-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you lire right there when it happens , as close as you can get , you will suddenly find yourself on the frayed edge of the fabric of space-time . It stands to reason . " <p> Lydia felt unreasonably happy . " When the time is right , I would like very much to see your machine . " " I 'll invite you . " <p> Lydia stayed and talked with Enzo until he closed the shop , and then she walked home , reflecting on all the turns their conversation had taken . <p> 9 Augusto Righi ( 1850-1921 ) is probably best known for his study of electromagnetic oscillations . His principal teaching post was at the University of Bologna , but he also taught at the University of Palermo in the years 1880-1885 . The machine which Enzo Capellino 's father saw Righi demonstrate was most likely the one designed by Righi to accumulate weak electric charges . Essentially , the apparatus consisted of a rubber belt looped between two metal pulleys set one above the other , and at the upper end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hollow copper sphere , leaving its electric charge there . In theory , there is no limit to the voltage which can be accumulated on the sphere . Probably the earliest precursor of Righi 's apparatus was a device built by Walckiers de St. Amand in France in 1784 . His machine was simply a silken belt stretched between two rollers , so that when you turned the rollers the silk moved , rubbing against small cushions positioned at the rollers , thereby accumulating an electric charge . <p> Enzo had long known that if he brushed his hand across certain materials , such as fur or wool or silk , an electric charge accumulated , so that if he then reached for a piece of metal a spark would jump from his finger to the metal , giving him a tiny shock . In his tailor shop he had noticed that he was able to get a particularly large spark by drawing wool cloth across the brass yardstick which formed the end of his cutting table , so he planned a machine with a broad continuous belt of thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , at one end there would be a large hollow copper sphere , pierced with a hole so that one of the rollers could be fixed inside . <p> 10 The sky was blue and the air warm when Lydia next visited the tailor 's shop . The clothing dummy in the window  --  the top half of a cheerful man who had worn a Harris tweed jacket all winter  --  now wore a white jacket with bright azure stripes ; furthermore , he had a straw boater on his head and his stiff hands were holding a cardboard sign ( ON VACATIOn ! WILL RETURN IN FUTURE . ) The door was unlocked , so Lydia walked through the shop and out to the garden where Enzo , in his shirt sleeves , was bent over a gleaming brass roller at least a yard long . His back was toward her , so she called out , " Mr. Capellino , hello . " <p> He straightened up and turned around , smiling . " You make my name sound so beautiful , " he said . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me Lydia , if you wish , " she replied . <p> " Lydia , I 'll get us something cool to drink . " He dashed up a rickety flight of outdoor stairs and entered the floor above the shop . Lydia looked around at the curved sheets of metal which lay here and there , and at the tangled garden which was just beginning to come into blossom . Enzo returned with a painted tray bearing a bottle and two glasses half-filled with ice . <p> " You are actually building an actual time machine , " Lydia said , deafly surprised . <p> " Actually , yes . " He poured something as dark as coffee from the bottle into one of the glasses and handed it to her . <p> " Now , I hope you will accept this , " Lydia said , handing him a large flat parcel . While Enzo unfolded the wrapping paper , she told him , " The librarian from Harvard says that the bookcase behind my father 's desk has a number of valuable books about botany and horticulture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things , about how valuable the books are . Right down to the penny . He 's afraid somebody might steal one of the volumes , so we should give them to Harvard for permanent safekeeping . He 's not concerned about this one and he let me take it from the house . It 's my father 's garden diary , all about the flowers in back of our house . Twenty years of notes and drawings . " <p> Enzo gently opened the worn volume . " This is wonderful , truly wonderful , " he murmured . " It 's a treasure and it should remain in your family . I appreciate your thinking of me , '  --  he was pressing the notebook to his chest as he said this  --  " but this journal should remain in your family , in your hands , " he said , giving it back to her . " Your father was a great botanist . He loved his plants almost as much as he loved you . " <p> Lydia 's eyes glistened and there was an awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said cheerfully and he drank . <p> Lydia raised her glass . " To you , " she echoed . The beverage was like liquid fire and not sweet . " Well ! " she said , gasping from the drink . " Well , well , well . Please tell me about your machine . ' <p> Enzo described how he was building a hollow metal tube which would be about four feet in diameter and stand about twenty feet tall . Inside , at the bottom of the tube , was a brass roller driven by an electric motor . A broad belt of wool ran from the bottom roller , up the tube and over another brass roller , then down the tube to the bottom roller again . And at the top of the tube there would be a great hollow metal sphere to gather the electric charges which would fly from the cloth , he explained . " That 's the hard part , " he added . <p> " The electric charges ? " <p> " No . The hard part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tube . It 's already fallen down twice . I think I 've misplaced some pieces . " <p> " It 's best to keep everything in its place , because then there 's a place for everything . That 's what Dwight says . " <p> " Oh , yes . Dwight , " murmured Enzo . " Would you like a little more wine ? " <p> " Is it legal to drink this ? " <p> " Oh , yes . My father made this many , many years ago . Before Prohibition . He loved to make wine . Shall I refill your glass ? " <p> Lydia began to laugh  --  a remarkably rich musical laugh . " Ah , Enzo , please , do , " she said , holding out her glass . She was , Enzo realized , just the slightest bit drunk . The days were getting longer and they enjoyed each other 's company until twilight , when Lydia said good-bye . <p> 11 Under the hot Sun Enzo had stripped to the waist and was working on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . " Hello , Enzo , " she said . " I received your invitation and here I am . " The 1920s fashion for women was all flatness and no curves , which struck Enzo as comically wrong , yet as she came walking in her sleeveless dress , one hand swinging the long strand of large green beads she wore around her neck , she was the most desirable woman in the world . As for Lydia , she wondered why she was there , saying hello to this short bronze man whose shoulders glistened with sweat and whose thick chest hair  --  well , Enzo had already snatched up his shirt and was buttoning it while she took in the great time machine . It stood erect in the center of the small garden , a thick twenty-foot column topped by a sphere which had been beautifully proportioned to the shaft but , as Enzo explained to Lydia , it had fallen a few times and was now somewhat reshaped . Indeed , it resembled a blunt arrowhead pointing skyward . " What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with her hand and gazed up at his apparatus . " It reminds me of something . I ca n't think what . It 's rather like  --  Oh !  --  It does look rather like a , or like the  --  " Lydia hesitated , searching for the proper term . " Yes , like a stamen , the stamen of a great flower . " <p> Enzo stood beside her , also looking up at it . " Ah , I had not thought of that , " Enzo said slowly . " But , yes , I suppose it does . " <p> " And it will make lightning ? " she asked him . <p> " Yes , at the top . I 'm sure of that . " <p> " And the lightning will tear the fabric of space-time , make a little rip in it ? " <p> " Yes , I 'm sure of that , too . " <p> " And you 'll be able to leap forward into next year or the year after that ? " <p> " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not so sure of that . I 've been working without sleep for the past five days . But I hope so . " Indeed , he did look tired . <p> " I hope so , too , " Lydia said . <p> " I 'll get us a cool drink , " Enzo said . He went up the wobbly flight of outdoor stairs and into his rooms above the shop and came back down with a basket of ice which cradled two large bottles of wine and two glasses . The day was warm and there was an uncertain breeze that blew strongly one moment and vanished the next , leaving only a dry stillness . Lydia sat on a cast-iron garden chair and Enzo sat on the small wood bench and they drifted in a long winding conversation as they drank the cool wine . <p> Lydia asked him about the metalwork at the top of the outdoor stairway . " It looks like a big bird cage , " she said . <p> " Ah , that 's a protective cage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go up those stairs and get inside it . At that height I 'll be level with the top of the lightning machine and close to it , but the lattice of metal will protect me from being hit . " <p> Lydia looked worried . " Are you sure you 'll be safe. ? Wo n't you be electrocuted. ? " <p> Enzo smiled . " I 'll be safe . My only worry is that the rip in the fabric of space-time wo n't be big enough for me to slip through . " <p> Lydia looked at the metal column with its banged up arrow-head crown . " How strange , " she said reflectively . " Here you are on an ordinary Monday afternoon . You 're about to leap forward in time , and no one knows . " <p> " You 're here , and that 's the world to me . Now it 's time I tested it . " Enzo strode to the machine and pressed the starter button . The motor began turning the brass roller so the great wool belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder , passing over the roller inside the metal sphere and down again . Little by little the speed of the rollers increased , the belt blurred , and the air was filled with a humming rattle . Enzo drank off the last of his wine , tossed the glass over his shoulder  --  he discovered that he could make these gestures with complete confidence so long as Lydia was nearby  --  and mounted the trembling stairway to the lattice cage . He stepped into the cage and looked down to the garden to discover that Lydia 's chair was empty . She was running up the stairs . She called to him , but the humming of the machine had grown louder . <p> " The librarian is going to ask me to marry him , " she said . " I do n't know what to do . I have n't been able to sleep for days . " <p> " I ca n't hear you , " cried Enzo from inside the cage , plainly shocked at what he had heard . <p> " He wrote me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this evening . " <p> " The librarian ! " <p> " Yes , Dwight has a schedule , and this evening he 's going to ask me to marry him . What do you think  --  " <p> " I think he 's an unpronounceable clump of consonants , " Enzo shouted over the growing thunder of the machine . <p> " Dwight says the future is known to people who make schedules . " <p> " Will you marry a man who has a place for everything and everything in its place ? A time for everything and everything in its time ? " <p> " I 'm forty-one years old and no one has ever proposed marriage to me , " she said , lifting her voice against the crackle of sparks . <p> " I 'm forty-three and have never dared propose marriage to anyone . I 've achieved nothing ! " <p> A bluish glow hovered over the row of phonograph needles which were fixed a hairsbreadth from the flying surface of the belt , and long thread-like sparks began to flare from the bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have made this wonderful machine , " she cried . <p> " But it may work no better than I have ? <p> Enzo threw open the lattice door and started out to meet her just as Lydia started in , the two clutching each other as the first lightning bolt unfurled and snapped overhead like a colossal whip . The hair on Enzo 's chest burst into flame , scorching Lydia 's breasts . The world overflowed with light as every nail and rivet , every garden tool , the cast iron garden chair and even the garden itself surged toward them , all the while flaring apart , coming undone . " Yes ! " Lydia thought  --  or maybe she actually cried aloud  --  " Yes ! We 're at the front edge of now and these are the raveled threads of space-time . " And everything melted like a meteor into the rising dark . <p> 12 When Enzo opened his eyes he was flat on his back in the garden . He realized that his arms were around Lydia , her arms over his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lattice cage lay upon them like a shredded blanket . Lydia opened her eyes and sat up . She looked at the blue sky , glanced down at her singed dress and the string of melted beads , then looked at Enzo . " We 're alive and it 's a beautiful day , " she said . <p> " Yes , " said Enzo , looking at his pocket watch whose fused hands said three o'clock . " And I wonder which day it is . " <p> They went through the shop and out the front door to the street to ask the first passerby what day it was and what time of day . It was three in the afternoon on Tuesday , May 22 , 1928 , precisely twenty-four hours ahead of where they had been . <p> " You 've worked wonders , Enzo . We 've jumped a day ahead and we 're free to make whatever we want of our time . " <p> " I propose marriage , " he said , smiling up at her . <p> " I accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they set off to get dinner , because they both felt wonderfully hungry , quite famished in fact , as if they had been asleep and had not eaten for a whole day . <p> 13 In June of 1928 a man buying a seersucker jacket asked Enzo what the equipment in the back yard was for . When Enzo told him that it was a machine for generating lightning bolts , the man became extraordinarily interested and asked so many questions that Enzo , in a burst of confidence , began to tell him about the fabric of space-time , upon which the man gave a short laugh and said the tailor did n't know what he was talking about . <p> In 1929 , a year after Enzo and Lydia had made their jump forward in time , Robert Van de Graaff built a small electrostatic generator at Princeton University , capable of producing around eighty thousand volts . Later , at the inaugural dinner of the American Institute of Physics , he demonstrated an improved version of the same apparatus . It resembled in all essentials the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Capellino 's shop . In 1931 Van de Graaff joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began assembling a double generator composed of two twenty-three-foot-high columns , each containing two belts and supporting an aluminum sphere six feet in diameter . This machine , capable of generating fifty million electron volts , was housed in its own building at MIT and , after some changes , was used as an atom smasher . In the 1950s MIT donated it to the Boston , Museum of Science and in 1980 the Museum installed it in the Thomson Theatre of Electricity , where it currently produces spectacular demonstrations of man-made lightning . <p> 14 Enzo and Lydia were married on Saturday , June 23 , 1928 , and their daughter , Abigail Santuzza Capellino , was born in autumn of the following year . They lived in the large square house on Kirkland Street , and Enzo continued to work as a tailor for some months , then sold his shop in order to devote himself to the extensive Chase gardens , which were succumbing to overgrowth and weeds . Old Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lydia to an interest in pomology , and they became quite expert in that field , publishing a number of papers on apple species of New England and New York . <p> Although they wrote for scholarly horticultural journals and for garden club magazines , neither Enzo nor Lydia ever published anything about their time transit . They remained silent about the event partly because they enjoyed their privacy , and partly because they came to know how dangerous the experiment had been . They were lucky to have awakened with nothing worse than hunger pangs , as if they had merely been asleep for a day , but they feared some other experimenter might not survive . Despite the protective metal latticework , technically known as a Faraday cage , the couple were fortunate not to have been electrocuted-much as Ben Franklin , flying his kite into an electrical storm , had been fortunate . Still , a lightning flash during a summer storm always remained a happy sight for the couple . It was a great pleasure for Lydia and Enzo to take their grandchildren to the Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by that machine which is called a Van de Graaff generator . <p> Most encyclopedias have an entry for Robert Jamison Van de Graaff ( 1901-1967 ) and , if the encyclopedia is large enough , there may be one for Augusto Righi ( 1850-1920 ) , a figure better known in Italy where there is , indeed , a school named for him . But virtually no one has heard of Enzo Augusto Capellino ( 1885-1970 ) or Lydia Prescott Capellino ( 1887-1971 ) . I wish to thank Abigail Capellino Beauchemin , the daughter of Enzo and Lydia , who has generously made available to me her father 's notes and diagrams , and her mother 's diary for the years 1927 and 1928 . <p> <p> By Eugene Mirabelli <p> Gene Mirabelli is the author of five novels and numerous stories , articles , and reviews , yet he thinks he might be the least known man of letters since Hawthorne ( who ? ) .
