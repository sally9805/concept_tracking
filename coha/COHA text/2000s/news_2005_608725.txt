<p> There is nothing more universal , it turns out , than a father yelling at his offspring . <p> Since its debut last year , millions of viewers worldwide have tuned in to watch " American Chopper , " Discovery Channel 's reality show about the battles between motorcycle builder Paul Teutul Sr. and his sons at a family-run business in California . <p> The show is No. 2 in Poland . It recently debuted in Malaysia . Teutul 's sometimes vulgar vocabulary has been translated into Castillan , Portuguese and Chinese . <p> As Discovery marks its 20th anniversary , the Silver Spring media company has moved beyond the science-based premise of founder John S. Hendricks . It has set aside the risky Internet and video-on-demand ventures that cost it tens of millions of dollars during the dot-com craze . <p> Instead , it is trying to divine the tastes of 160 countries , hoping that U.S.-produced shows like " MythBusters " might take off in Tazania , or " FBI Files " might shoot to the top in South Korea . <p> Discovery is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britain and elsewhere . The formula has already produced a couple of regional winners , such as " Virtual History , " a British show that uses computer-generated imagery  --  Adolf Hitler 's face superimposed on an actor 's body  --  to re-create historic events . " Afterlife , " a show popular in Asia , looks at how people in different cultures deal with death . <p> If that seems to be an exotic strategy for a company that began with a focus on documentaries about the natural world , there is a good reason . While its 16 U.S. channels still drive revenue at Discovery , they have been beset by challenges , including a sense that they are now at a saturation point with limited potential for growth . About 90 million U.S. households receive Discovery channels with their cable subscriptions . <p> Ratings are down at TLC , an important piece of the Discovery operation . The success of its popular " Trading Spaces " home-decorating show has been undermined by numerous copycats , and the loss of audience has forced the company to give advertisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company brought in new management recently and stepped up program development . As many as 90 new shows are now in the works , with the first batch to debut this fall . <p> Discovery Communications Inc. chief executive Judith A. McHale said in an interview that consumer tastes are changing more rapidly than ever . <p> " We have to constantly reinvent ourselves , " she said . <p> Discovery has room to add subscribers to its digital networks , such as FitTV and DiscoveryHome . But by and large , Discovery 's U.S. networks are a " mature " business , said Andrew Baker , an analyst at Cathay Financial LLC . <p> So Discovery is setting its sights overseas  --  and inside classrooms . The company is planning to invest $100 million over the next several years developing its international subscriber base , and will put an equal amount into a nascent education business . <p> Both the education business and the international channels take advantage of Discovery 's library of programs . <p> The education division , for example , recently began marketing a service that delivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clips are sorted so that they meet state education standards . They also come with lesson plans and quizzes . Discovery plans to expand the video-streaming service overseas and is testing a home service in the United States . <p> About 60 percent of the programs produced by Discovery 's U.S. channels are reused abroad , but the company plans to sink more money into producing original shows for its international viewers . <p> " That 's the key to our international strategy  --  to customize programming for each country , " said David C. Leavy , a spokesman . <p> Discovery also is recycling its international shows for domestic audiences : On Friday , Discovery launched two new U.S. channels that use material from Discovery 's Latin American and Spanish networks . <p> McHale said she would like to explore more programming for emigre audiences all over the world , whether they 're Japanese living in Brazil or Hindus living in London . <p> The education business and the international networks have begun generating returns for Discovery . Last year , the international division 's revenue increased 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Revenue from U.S. networks increased 19 percent . <p> Baker said investing in education and international networks are safe bets . A hundred million dollars " is not a big investment for them , " he said . " They have the content already . It 's probably a decent investment . " <p> Others concur with Baker 's assessment . After all , rerunning video clips of grasshoppers or " The Crocodile Hunter " has none of the bold vision of , for example , Your Choice TV , the video-on-demand service into which the company invested tens of millions of dollars in the 1990s . Nor does it have the cachet of the planned initial public offering of Discovery.com , formed in 2000 as an experiment in content delivery and online retailing . <p> But at this stage in the company 's evolution , that 's kind of the point , McHale said . <p> Video on demand finally caught on with TiVo and other digital video recorders . But Your Choice TV " was way ahead of its time , McHale said . " The technology was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the planned IPO of the dot-com was canceled in late 2000 . " In both cases we let technology drive the business model and we and just about everybody else got ahead of consumers . No one stopped to say , ' What does the consumer want ? ' " <p> Company managers learned from those failures , McHale said , and now pursue a strategy she describes as " conservatively aggressive . " <p> The other avenue for growth is acquisition . Discovery will be in a better position to buy other media properties at the end of the month , when Liberty Media spins off its 50 percent stake in Discovery into a publicly traded company called Discovery Holding Company . Discovery 's other owners are the privately held Cox Communications Inc. , Advance/Newhouse Communications Inc. and founder Hendricks . If Cox and Newhouse contribute their shares to the spinoff , Discovery will effectively become a publicly traded enterprise . But neither company is expected to do so in the near future , for tax reasons . <p> There is little for Discovery to buy anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the National Geographic Channel , which is co-owned by News Corp. , and the National Geographic Society , among others , or E.W. Scripps Co. , which owns the Food Network and HGTV . Malone said he has talked to News Corp . Chairman Rupert Murdoch about buying National Geographic , but would need the society and the channel 's international partners to sign off on the deal . Scripps , he said , is not for sale . <p> Discovery has evolved into a company far larger and more complex than McHale said she ever expected , with $2.4 billion in revenue last year and about 4,000 employees . <p> She attributed the company 's success to several strategic decisions , including an early move to own its content , which allowed Discovery to expand internationally and into other media , and a later choice to stick to factual programming and not be " distracted " by offering traditional entertainment . <p> The advantage of sticking to the stories of bugs or motorcycle makers , McHale said , is that by doing so , Discovery " taps into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I did n't know that .
