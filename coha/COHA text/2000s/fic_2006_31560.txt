Chapter One EconoHart Corporate Headquarters Minneapolis , Minnesota February 13 , 2006 - Original Message- From : Scott Wythe To : Julie Kay About Sent : Tuesday , February 13 , 2006 12:02 PM Subject : latest draft hey girl so here it is i made some changes but it 's looking really good , maybe tweak the dog a little more and then it 'll be perfect . way cool girl ! scotty - Original Message- From : Julie Kay About To : Scott Wythe Sent : Tuesday , February 13 , 2006 12:12 PM Subject : Re : latest draft Stop doing that . You 're a grown man ( I 'm assuming , as we 've never met face-to-face ) and you write e-mails like you just escaped the second grade . Say it with me : punctuation . Capital letters . " I " is always capitalized , even when it 's in the middle of the sentence . We might write for a bad greeting card company , but we 're still writers , for Christ 's sake . Now : I will not tweak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The damned dog is fine the way it is . Let 's let this thing GO already . J.K. - Original Message - From : Fred Hammer , I.T .

Department Sent : Tuesday , February 13 , 2006 1:22 PM Subject : Everyone get back to work Julie , sorry to bother you . Keep up the good work . I can assure you , the I.T . department will not be bothering you again . Right , fellas ? Scott , I hope recent events are n't putting you off the work environment here at EconoHart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad you 've joined us ! Chapter Two Julie Kay leaned back in her office chair and smirked at the screen . Good old Don-o , swinging to the rescue . He did n't spend eight months wooing her away from Hallmark only to have I.T . weenies drive her out the door over some silly bullshit . Although , cc'ing the big boss was kind of a dirty trick . But then , who played nice these days ? It slowed you down , if nothing else . Her computer beeped at her and she frowned-had n't there been enough of this stuff today ? - then called up the e-mail . - Original Message - From : Scott Wythe To : Julie Kay About Sent : Tuesday , February 13 , 2006 2:30 PM Subject : still waiting hey so glad we got that cleared up you were totally awesome grrrl but i 'm still waiting for the last draft of the card . do u want me to come over there and pick it up cuz it 's no prob . good job with the weenies. maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yowled , and slammed her fists on the keyboard . Instantly , " sdlkjfa ; **28;1746;TOOLONG " streamed across the screen and she hastily took her fingers away and cleared the mess . Would the boy never learn ? Why would n't he let the stupid card go to Production ? She was the one with the degrees in Creative Writing and Graphic Arts . He was-what ? Was he even her age ? He sure did n't write like it . But then , who did these days ? It was like most people assumed having e-mail meant never having to spell or capitalize . She was shocked at the number of high-level executives who would never dream of sending out a business letter without punctuation , but thought nothing of e-mailing " how u doon grrrl ? " to a colleague . Although ... she was at Corporate , and Scott was forty miles away in the Marketing building at Brooklyn Park . Not exactly a hop , skip , and a jump ; plus , they had couriers to pick up the hard stuff . That was kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be because he was the new guy . New guys were always anxious to make a good impression . She took another look at the final sketch . Stupid dog on the cover , stupid , insipid saying on the inside , Happy Birthday , buh-bye . She had planned to write the Great American Short Story , and instead she drew dogs and thought up words that rhymed with " birthday . " And no matter how hard she worked , how hard they all worked , business was steadily dropping off . The homemade card craze-Julie Kay mused , rubbing her lips , then scowling at the bright red stain on her fingers-is killing us . So , it made sense to put forth her best effort , always . And Scott was a pair of fresh eyes . Maybe the puppy could use a little more definition in the face and paws ... would n't hurt to try and it would only be another five minutes or so ... - Original Message - From : Julie Kay About To : Scott Wythe Sent : Tuesday , February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , ( I 'm assuming you 're a grown man , thus I refuse to refer to you as Scotty . Puppies and pet rabbits are named Scotty . ) I gave it one more tweak , as you suggested , and though I ca n't tell the difference , you might . I 'm sending the final version over by courier right now ; you should have it within the hour . So off my back , hose-head . Sorry about the mess you got in earlier . The I.T . department ( and I know you 're reading this , you Gestapo bastards , and why do n't you go fuck yourselves ? ) and I have a history . They think the Third Reich is alive and well , and I think that as long as I 'm working here sixty hours a week and getting more work done than anyone else in the department , it 's none of their damn business what I put in an e-mail . Do n't forget what I said about capitalizing and punctuation . Even if you are only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.K. Chapter Three " I 'm holding up fine . " " I did n't say anything . " " So do n't start . " " Who 's starting ? " " I love my life . " " I love your life , too . " " Okay , then . " " Okay . " Julie Kay sipped coffee and studied her sister with narrowed eyes . Four years younger , Kara Jay was her psychic and physical opposite : short , plump , blond , radiant with sunshine and fulfillment . She had two under two at home , and another baby due in April . She had the open , friendly face of a foundation model , light blue eyes , and a small nose-a classic Swedish face , coupled with a classic Midwestern temperament . Her husband made a great living in construction , and looked like he modeled for Speedo calendars in his spare time . They went to Disney World for a week every year , and cut down their own Christmas trees . They had been happily married for five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's an alien come to observe me , Julie Kay marveled , counting the freckles on her sister 's nose , right in my own family ! " So what are you doing tomorrow ? " Kara Jay asked . " And stop counting my freckles . " " Basking in the joy of my single lifestyle . " " No , really . " " No . Really . " " If you just- " " No. " " - he 's a very nice guy- " " No. " " - has his own roofing company- " " No. " " - showed him your picture- " " No-no-no-no-no-no-no . " " He thought you were cute , " her sister peeped , then took a hurried gulp of her double-tall , caffeine-free skinny latte . " No blind dates . And that ... " she added , pointing , " ... is not a coffee . " " Now who 's starting ? " " Kara Jay , I 'm just saying . I know you do n't believe me , but let 's go through it one more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay up as late as I want-like a real grownup ! - and never once have to read , or think about reading , Everybody Poops . " " It was just that one month , " her sister grumbled . " To get Willie over the hump . " " I like being able to eat cold pizza from any room in my house at any time . I like having the bed to myself . I like having the place to myself . I like having my life to myself . " " Except tomorrow , " Kara Jay pointed out triumphantly . Literally pointed out , and Julie Kay noticed her sister was in sore need of a manicure . " Well . Tomorrow . " " Valentine 's Day . The holiday . You ca n't be alone that day , you just ca n't . It breaks my heart to think about it . It 's practically a law . " " Would that be federal or state ? " " And look where you work ! You 'll be surrounded by plush things all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere you look : hearts and chocolate . If you do n't have a date to look forward to after work , how will you get through it ? " " I had planned , " she admitted , " to bring my friend Captain Morgan to work . " " No , do n't get drunk again-Don will only overlook so much . " " I have to spread my creative wings , " Julie Kay declared . " And since I 'm the best graphic designer he 's got , Don will overlook a lot . " " Well , your wings are n't helped by getting sloppo at work and then picking fights with the I.T . guys . Ugh , remember the Christmas party ? It was so mean-you were bigger than all of them . " " Weenies . " " Considerably bigger , " her sister added , which was a good one , given that she was n't exactly a lightweight herself . " And before you say it , I 'm creating life . What 's your excuse ? " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an extra ten pounds here and there . " " And everywhere ! " Kara Jay added brightly . " It 's a good thing you 're tall . " " Kara Jay ... " " That 's all I 'm saying . You can hide almost anything on that long frame of yours , you lucky cow . " " Kara Jay . " " It 's just , you 're so pretty without half trying ! That 's what makes me nuts ! " Her sister ruffled her own streaked hair in frustration . " Think how great you 'd look if you 'd actually-you know-make an effort . " She nearly spilled her latte in her excitement . " You know , get a haircut , some bangs , stop wearing it in that tacky long braid all the time . You look like Xena- " " I think Lucy Lawless has bangs , " she said mildly . " - started wearing some color instead of black all the time , start wearing pretty shoes instead of those clunky-er-whatever they are ... " " Clogs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ! What do you need comfortable shoes for ? You could stand to wear a pair of nice pumps every other day . " " You forgot to tell me that colored contacts will rid me of my boring brown eyes , " she prompted , " and the glasses . " " Your eyes are beautiful-do n't you dare touch them ! But you should get contacts , definitely get rid of the glasses , so everyone can see how pretty they are . " " And ... ? " " Well , the usual . " " Get married and have babies . " " Yes . " " Death first , " she said grimly , and finished her coffee in a scalding gulp . Chapter Four She did n't even have to look at the Caller I.D . on her phone to see who it was . She debated letting her sister yammer into voice mail , but there would be no forgiveness if there was n't an immediate call back . " Johnny 's Mortuary , " she said , cradling the receiver between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we slab ' em . " " That is so old , " her sister said . " That was old when we were in training bras . " " I still am . What is it now ? I 'm busy . " Julie Kay stared at the galley-a galley ! for a get-well card ! - before her . Thought this might cheer you up And make you feel frisky as a pup . Ugh ! " Is it dog week around here and nobody told me ? " she asked . The last thing I want to feel like is a frisky pup . " Not that I know of , " Kara Jay replied impatiently . " Listen , we did n't really get a chance to finish talking about your date at lunch . " " No blind dates ! " She picked up a pen and angrily slashed through the insipid text . " Julie Kay ... be reasonable . Just once , to see what it feels like . " " Just once ? How can your memory be so shitty ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be reasonable for once . Besides , Sean really thinks you two will hit it off . " Thoughts of your imminent demise Make me wish we had come to a compromise " No , no , no . " " What ? Julie Kay ? " " Never mind . I mean , do mind ! No blind dates-jeez , do I have to tattoo it on my shoulder ? " " That reminds me , do you have any tattoos ? Sean asked me to find out so he can tell this guy . I remember you were threatening to get one of a run-over Road Runner on your ass , but you never showed it to me , so I honestly don't- " " Kara Jay ! Why are n't you listening to me ? You can hear a toddler drop a Cheerio from half a block away , but ' no blind dates ' does n't hit your radar ? " " It 's a totally different thing , " her sister insisted . " The next time your kids come over , " she warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm stuffing them with ice cream and chocolate . " " You do that every time . " " Need I remind you ? " " What ? I already know ; I 'm the one who has to talk them down from the ceiling at 10:30 P.M. " " No , I mean , need I remind you of my track record with blind dates ? " " A few bad experiences shouldn't- " " What ? Are you on drugs ? " " That 's none of your business , " her sister said primly . " Remember that guy , the Iowan who took us out with your then-boyfriend ? We went to the state gymnastics trials ? On the way there , he talked and talked about ' the Republican way of life , ' got out of the car to try to shoot the deer that had crossed the road-who brings a shotgun on a date , by the way ? - then sulked through the sets because he missed the poor thing . " " He was just trying too hard . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacking off . Then-remember ? I make the casual comment that I think gymnasts are really gifted , and he gets all huffy , like , ' You saying I ca n't do that ? ' and stomps down to the floor and tries , actually tries one of the routines , and breaks an ankle ! Then got pissed when I would n't ride in the ambulance with him ! " " That just put you off Republicans , " her sister said reasonably . " Not blind dates . " " Okay , fine . You want to play rough ? How about the model you set me up with during college ? " " The watch model , or the dress-sock model ? " " The entire date he kept checking himself out in the mirror behind me . I mean , he was good-looking , but nobody 's that much of an Adonis . The whole time I had the creepy feeling someone was sneaking up on me . I had to constantly fight the urge to turn around and check . Then I find out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Greek major , like he told me . It was from the condom brand ! Yerrrgggh ! " ( Continues ... )
