Photograph POWERFUL ILLINOIS LEGISLATOR , Emil Jones Jr , addresses stale senate , huddles ( opposite page ) with Gov . Rod Blagojevich , and relaxes with his fiancee Dr. Lorrie Stone , a psychologist. // MIL JONES JR. , Illinois senate president , is one of the nation 's most powerful politicians . As the second African-American to head the state senate , the Chicago-based Democrat , who recently won a second term , has tremendous influence over a $54 billion state budget . Jones , 69 , a street-smart political veteran with a gravelly voice , also uses his considerable influence to make sweeping changes in state government to give more to the disadvantaged and social programs such as public education that have been traditionally underserved . " My role is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Jones between answering phone calls and handing off requests to his staff . " I 'm in a position to improve the quality of life for people . I 'm opening doors . " Jones ranks as one of the top four state political leaders in Illinois and is the only African-American senate president nationwide . " He 's always impressed me as someone from the old school , who worked the inside game , but remains committed to the agenda for the disenfranchised and the poor , " says newly elected U.S. Sen. Barack Obama ( D-IlL ) . " He is a strong proponent of Black business and has been a longtime champion of the underdog . People who know him say he is in politics for the right reasons . " Obama , who calls Jones his " political godfather , " credits the senior statesman for paving the way for the then relatively unknown Obama to step to the center of the political stage . Jones says he " wept like it was my own child " when Obama delivered his electrifying speech last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotting sharp talent is something he 's been quietly demonstrating most of his political career . He surrounds himself with a relatively young staff of business , legal and political professionals from top schools . " I am not only here to serve now , but to prepare others to take the baton in the future , " he says . Since his early involvement in local Democratic politics , Jones has made good use of gentle arm-twisting , old-style back pats , rubbing elbows with downstate rural legislators and doing his homework to move his agenda of helping the poor and disadvantaged . Surviving political life has n't always been smooth sailing , but Jones mastered the art of the wheeler-dealer over the past 40 years to firmly take the helm of his current post . His motto : " Know your opponent and be solidly prepared . " Photograph U.S. SEN . BARACK OBAMA ( D-111. ) was a Jones protg in the Illinois senate . A major supporter of educational institutions , Jones joins Chicago State University President Dr. Elnora D. Daniel ( left ) in breaking ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his late wife , Patricia Jones . During family gathering over gumbo ( below ) , he applauds the recitation of granddaughter Alexandria Sterling ( below , r . ) . Also pictured ( 1 . to r. ) are daughter Renee L.

" Emil is very smart and one of the most unpretentious men I have ever met . " Under Jones " leadership as senate president , the Illinois General Assembly in 2004 passed a budget that increased education funding by $389 million in Illinois public schools . Jones pressed for and won a minimum-wage increase , pay equity for women , health-care programs for the poor , more state contracts for minority-owned businesses and legal reforms on capital crimes . Jones also believes the state should do more to help impoverished and disenfranchised minority communities , even to the point of using funds from legalized gambling to fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones pushed through legislation to provide a percentage of revenues from a new gaming license in Illinois to go to inner-city Chicago State University rather than the more prestigious University of Illinois downstate . He is also responsible for targeting enviable funding to Chicago State for capital improvements , scholarships and technology programs , including a new library . The school is also building a convocation center , named for Jones and his late wife , Patricia Jones . " Senator Jones has made it possible for incredible opportunities for students at Chicago State University , " says President Elnora D. Daniel . " He has brought economic resources totaling $200 million to the university that have long been overlooked . Our students are now in position to better compete in technology and other fields the same as students do from other state-supported institutions . " Few politicians match the senate president 's commitment of more than $100 million in funding to support public works projects , social services agencies , nonprofit groups , the Chicago Park District and the City Colleges of Chicago , says Cliff Kelly , a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good government , " Kelly says , " he is effective government . He has the capacity to identify the right issues , hold on to them and push them through . As a leader of the Democratic Party , he 's been able to do great things for our community that his conservative Republican predecessor never did . " One of eight children raised by a stern truck-driver father and a homemaker mother , Jones says he grew up impoverished in the Morgan Park community on Chicago 's South Side . " You have to understand , I was a poor , dark child with no real opportunities , " he says . " Nothing was given to you . Eveiything was designed for you to fail . There were no Black heroes for us to look up to . " Well-to-do , fair-skinned kids in the neighborhood were n't allowed to play with him and they regularly taunted him about his color , Jones says . Thanks to nurturing schoolteachers , Jones learned the power of patience , perseverance and belief in one 's self to overcome fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in my life , " he says . " Having lived through those experiences gave me the desire to fight for the disadvantaged . You saw The Wizard ofOz ; you got to believe in yourself . That 's how I made it . " Jones also learned early political lessons from his father , Emil Jones Sr. , who worked as bailiff to a well-known Cook County Circuit Court Judge in Chicago and as a Democratic precinct captain in three wards to get out the Black vote . After graduating from Chicago Loop Junior College ( later renamed Harold Washington College ) and majoring in business administration at Roosevelt University , Jones held several jobs before going into politics . Like many Democratic politicians holding office today , Jones volunteered for John F. Kennedy 's 1960 presidential campaign and served as an aide to Alderman Wilson Frost , a powerful Democratic Party politician . " It was there I began to see how politics could impact injustices and the allocation of resources for people , " he says . " As I got more involved , I decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of life for people . " The measure of Jones " passion for public service is often affirmed when he operates on full blast in tough political battles . " When he was standing alone for money for education , Jones would n't allow the Illinois General Assembly to balance the budget on the backs of the poor , " says Raymond Ewell , a former Illinois Democratic representative and one of Jones ' longtime advisors . " They went into overtime for weeks until they finally came out with a budget that put more money into education and health care . " Photograph IN HIS STATEHOUSE OFFICE , Jones poses below a work of art with a quotation from Sun-Tzu , which says , roughly translated : " Do not depend on opponents not coming ; depend rather on being ready for them . " // First elected to the Illinois House in 1972 , Jones served 10 more years in the senate . He was chosen as senate minority leader in 1993 . He received the unanimous support of the Senate Democratic Caucus to be first elected senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her dedication and influence over his political character . He recalls how she insisted that they adopt their 2-year-old nephew 25 years ago when Jones ' brother and sister-in-law were no longer able to care for him . The couple already had four other children at the time . These days , the senate president begins the day with a morning workout before getting into his daily routine . The talk around town centers on the eye-popping engagement ring of his fiance , Dr. Lorrie Stone , a psychologist and his frequent escort during the past year . Hard work , unwavering faith , broad shoulders to weather the political storms and persistence have paid off for Emil Jones , a self-proclaimed champion of the underdog . And he has a bit of advice for anyone who might have doubts while climbing the political ladder or the ladder of life in general : " Do n't let anybody tell you that you ca n't achieve .
