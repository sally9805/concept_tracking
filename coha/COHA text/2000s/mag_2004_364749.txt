FOR SOCIAL REASONS For humans , food does more than merely nourish . It socializes  --  and civilizes  --  us as well <P> If you ever find yourself dining with a family in the South African kingdom of Lesotho , you 'd better have a taste for eyeballs  --  that is , if you 're the male head of a household . Tradition requires the host to honor your family in a truly special way : with the cooked head of a sheep . Everyone will be served the feast , but only you will be presented with the eyes . <P> A sheep 's head is a big deal in Lesotho , where most folks do n't often get to enjoy meat . When they do , they like it rich and fatty , and they eat it right down to the offal . Presenting the crowning part of so prized a meal to a guest is no small gesture . <P> For human beings , eating has never been a simple matter . To a frog snagging a fly or a pelican nabbing a fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ritual of eating  --  the act of pulling up and tucking in , of passing around and helping oneself  --  is one of the most primal of shared activities . We eat together when we celebrate , and we eat together when we grieve ; we eat together when a loved one is preparing to leave , and we eat together when the loved one returns . We solve our problems over the family dinner table , conduct our business over the executive lunch table , entertain guests over cake and cookies at the coffee table . <P> " Interaction over food is the single most important feature of socializing , " says Sidney Mintz , professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University . " The food becomes the carriage that conveys feelings back and forth . " <P> It 's not just families that define themselves through foods . Whole cultures do so too . Muslims eat halal and Jews eat kosher and Roman Catholics forgo meat on Fridays . Moroccans do n't eat what Swedes eat , who do n't eat what the Japanese eat , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home countries and settle elsewhere , the cultural feathering they bring with them  --  language , dress , music  --  is often shed within a generation . But the foods linger . " The last part of a culture that gets lost are the food ways , " says Barrett Brenton , nutritional anthropologist at St. John 's University in New York City . " We find comfort in our cuisines . " <P> Although that has long been the way food works , it is becoming less so  --  at least in the developed world , where scarcity has been replaced by overabundance and undernourishment by obesity . Increasingly , the connection between eating and ritual is becoming unhinged . We turn too much to food for solace and celebration , and we do it with less and less reference to traditions or even formal mealtimes  --  to the detriment of our figure and our health .
