For all those true believers who are still certain that the Web is the greatest thing ever to come along , Mike McCue wants to set the record straight . " The Internet is man 's second most important communications invention , " explains the wiry , effusive former Netscape-browser team member . " The first is the phone . " <P> Hello ? Well , McCue , CEO of the pioneering Silicon Valley voice portal Tellme , which he co-founded with a few old foes from Microsoft , has a big stake in Alexander Graham Bell 's 19th century wonder . Although McCue previously helped devise a cool Web-surfing experience , he 's now betting that people want an easier way to tap the Net 's vast resources  --  without booting a PC or grappling with the tiny screen and keys of a PDA . <P> And what could possibly be easier to use or more ubiquitous than the phone ? Thanks to recent advances in voice-recognition software , callers can dial up Tellme , talk to the phone and listen to it talk back  --  announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to news , weather , traffic , horoscopes , entertainment listings and restaurant reviews . Not surprisingly , countless other brash Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have joined Tellme in the latest , hysterical high-tech land grab . Today an estimated 4 million callers in the U.S. use dozens of voice portals  --  from BeVocal and HeyAnita to Audiopoint . <P> The past six months have been a real wake-up call . The voice portals initially talked VCs and other investors out of about half a billion in start-up money . But the sophisticated equipment required for advanced voice systems does n't come cheap . Powerful players like AOL , Yahoo and Lycos have also rolled out voice services for their members . And consumers have about as much patience for audio advertising  --  banner ads for your ears  --  as they have for telemarketers . Throw in the NASDAQ slump , and it 's no wonder most voice portals have given up building a consumer brand and put their IPO dreams on hold . Tellme , with $240 million in funding , is the only one spending on marketing . <P> Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on helping other , more established businesses find their voice . Fortunately for him and these other operators , there 's no shortage of prospects in the telephone industry . As brutal price wars devastate their bottom lines , telco giants are desperate to find new sources of revenue . They 're joined by automakers that , with states increasingly clamping down on drivers ' use of cell phones , are following the lead of General Motors to design hands-free , voice-activated systems for making calls and checking e-mail . FORTUNE 500 firms are looking to give roving workers an easier way to access critical data , while many businesses see voice applications as an affordable means of upgrading shoddy customer service . <P> " Companies have made lots of investment in the Web , " says Steve Ehrlich , vice president of marketing at Nuance , which , along with Speechworks , is among the leading voice-recognition software makers . " Voice technology lets them leverage that to reach a much broader range of customers . " How broad ? Nuance 's sales shot up 170% last year , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelsey Group , a Princeton , N.J. , research firm , the annual market for the panoply of voice applications and equipment could be $75 billion , up from a few hundred million today .
