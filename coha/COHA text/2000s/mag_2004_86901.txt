For the sake of truth in advertising , K2 Promotions , the company recently formed by Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko to market their fight cards , may have to regroup under an arithmetically-adjusted banner . But at least following Vitali Klitschko 's brutal pounding of Corrie Sanders for the vacant WBC heavyweight tide last Saturday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles , there is still a K to promote . And , considering the fun everybody seemed to have watching the 6 ' 8 " Ukrainian rain blows on his undersized and undertrained opponent , K1 could well be all the K we 'll ever need . // Although the Klitschko brothers have long hoped that they would one day reign together ( there are , after all , four titles , of varying credibility ) , most knowledgeable observers thought that if one of these air-force-veteran , four-language-speaking Ph.D . ' s was going to succeed in this sport , it was probably going to be the younger , somewhat more athletic , less robotic Wladimir. // Yet it 's Vitali  --  not entirely ungainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rather sad roost that has become heavyweight boxing . After a two-week span in which all four of the division 's entities held title bouts ( including the WBO match on April 10 , when Wladimir was knocked out by Lamon Brewster ) , Vitali is the sole bona fide heavyweight champion , someone big and tall who likes to punch hard . // This distinction is as much by pedigree as performance , since his title is the one vacated by the last true champion , Lennox Lewis . And do n't forget , it was Vitali who was giving Lewis all he wanted last year before being stopped on cuts . Lewis chose retirement  --  and , by the looks of him at ringside on Saturday , the buffet table-over a rematch . // The elder Klitschko may be champion in a time of reduced standards , but he does not provoke boredom , as the other champions do . When faced with the same South African who flattened his brother a year earlier ( the sibs look out for each other ) , Vitali did not choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Sanders , a fellow given to big-game hunting on his 1,000-hectare ranch , says he prefers golf to boxing and was considering campaigning for a European tour card before his surprising victory over Wladimir revitalized his stalled career . He said training for this fight turned his scratch game into a two handicap , but judging by his physique , he still must have spent plenty of time at the 19th hole . // His strategy in this fight was to be entirely reactive , hoping to lure the bigger Klitschko into a counterpunching duel , during which  --  in one of Sanders 's 30-second bursts of fighting each round  --  he 'd nail him with his big left . But Vitali , who is nowhere near as fluid as his brother , is too smart ( and too sturdy ) to be felled by such a ploy . After nearly eight rounds of one-sided and fairly persuasive potshotting by Vitali , the referee decreed that enough was enough . // " A big relief , " said Vitali of his victory . He still hopes his brother will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nonetheless happy to have the attention solely on himself for a change . " I feel a huge weight off of my shoulders . Now I am out of the shadows . " // He wants to lure Lewis out of retirement but , failing that , is now confident enough to entertain all sorts of ideas for his next fight  --  Mike Tyson is one possible opponent he mentioned after Saturday 's bout . " Since I was 15 years old , I 've had a dream to fight Iron Mike , " he said , " and I always try to make my dreams come true . "
