Ash Child A Gabriel Du Pr Mystery By Peter Bowen Minotaur Books Du Pr was pissed off . He was in a hospital and he did nt like hospitals . He looked at the bottle on the rolling rack and then at the tubes that dripped the antibiotics into veins in his left arm . He glared at the peaks his toes made in the blue sheets . He pushed the covers back and swung his legs over the side of the bed . He stood up , put his left hand on the rolling rack , and walked out of his room and down the hall . Good morning , said the nurse at the station . She was busily filling out forms . Good morning , said Du Pr . Can I maybe get my clothes , leave now ? The nurse did nt look up from her records . Du Pr , she said , quit whining . Yah , said Du Pr . It was the flat hands-down worst appendix seen here in a long , long time . You waited till it busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mess . If youd come in when it began to hurt , youdve been home . Several days ago . Umph , said Du Pr . You cowboys , said the nurse , shutting one folder and opening another , have the smarts of anvils . Make a good cowboy , you catch a sheep-herder and kick his brains out . Yah , said Du Pr . So why do nt you go down to the kitchen and ask Isabel to make you some hot milk . It will help you sleep . Hot milk , Du Pr thought . Jesus . Hot milk . The nurse looked up . Look , she said , youll probably be able to go home the day after tomorrow . They wont be able to close up the wound until the infection is gone . Youll have to pack it , or have someone pack it for you . But the doctorll let you go Thursday . Uh , said Du Pr . A door banged . Boot heels sounded on the polished linoleum . Visitin hours ! Visitin hours , you snipe-nosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gab-reel Doo Pray .

Please go and see him . Tell Ron to come and see me . Du Pr started to push the rolling rack toward the door . Do nt forget the hot milk ! said the nurse , not looking up . Du Pr pulled open the door . Booger Tom was standing there , with his bony old finger in the chest of a young security guard who was backed against the wall . Old man , said Du Pr , it is good to see you ! Its past visiting hours , said the kid , looking terrified . Im gon na kill him , snarled Booger Tom , I am . Goddamn government innerference ever whar a man turns . Cant even go and see his bastard son ! Ron , said Du Pr , the nurse , she want talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kid , who was moving very rapidly past Du Pr . Du Pre turned and led Booger Tom down the hall to his room . He went in and sat on the bed and pointed at the flowered-print chair . Jesus , said Booger Tom , folks die in these damn places , ya know . Lets go . No , said Du Pr . All right , said Booger Tom . He lifted the huge book he was carrying . HOLY BIBLE . It gurgled . Booger Tom flipped up a port on the spine and pulled out a little spigot , and he went to the sink and filled half a plastic glass with whiskey . He ran cold water in the glass . He handed it to Du Pr . Du Pr swallowed it . He handed the glass back . Booger Tom mixed another . Another . Du Pr finally sighed and sat back on the bed and pulled the rolling rack over so the needles in his arm wouldnt pull . These places ai nt civilized , said Booger Tom . Theys deddy-cated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Du Pr laughed . And I spect ya cant smoke , neither , said Booger Tom , and screwin is outta the question . Du Pr laughed . No wonder folks die on the street , said Booger Tom . Easy to see why theyd want to , been in a place like this . Yah , said Du Pr . So whens they lettin you out ? said Booger Tom . He had a sack of Bull Durham in his hand . He fiddled out a paper with his fingers and rolled a smoke , one-handed . He licked the paper and put the cigarette in his mouth . Way I see it , he said , I gave ya one a these theyd throw us both out of here . Du Pr opened the drawer of the nightstand and took out a tin of snoose . He took a pinch and put it behind his lower lip . Booger Tom scratched a kitchen match on the seat of his canvas pants and the flame flared and he touched the end of the cigarette with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soused Booger Tom . He sat there for a moment , blinking , while water ran off his face and his hat . The cigarette was a sodden mess . Booger Tom looked at the door . I do nt care if you want to read the Bible , said the nurse . Read the Bible all night . Pray quietly . But you can not smoke in here , you old son of a bitch , and if you want to be wearing your ass for a hat just try that again . Yes , maam , said Booger Tom . Praise Jesus ! said the nurse . Her shoes squeaked a little on the waxed floor as she went back to her station . Du Pr looked at his friend . You are wet , he said . There are towels in the bathroom . Thats all right , said Booger Tom , I been wettern this a lot . She is dead set against tobacco , and she has made her point . Booger Tom held up the Bible and Du Pr nodded .

Booger Tom nodded . Everybody sends their best , said the old man . Du Pr looked at the Bible . Bart done give me that , said Booger Tom . Said he had it made long time ago and forgot to throw it out . Du Pr laughed . Bart Fascelli , drunk for years , bad drunk , been dry a long time now . But he was a good friend . I sorta thought youd be about ready to get the hell out of here , said Booger Tom , so I just got in the truck and come down . When are they springin you ? Thursday , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Maddy Collins was a nice addled old lady who lived a mile or so outside Toussaint . She had been in her little red house as long as Du Pr could remember . She did nt come to church or to town much . She worked in her flower beds . Beautiful flowers . She had a good water right and shed kept it . Benny looked it over , called the State Police come look , they couldnt find nothin . Du Pr shook his head . Killed her in her house , said Booger Tom . Beat her head in with a hatchet . Jesus , said Du Pr . Old Maddy Collins , said Booger Tom .
