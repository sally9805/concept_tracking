SO ONE DAY THESE ALIENS leave a message on my machine . <p> They say , " This is the Intergalactic Space Alien Federation . We are taking over your planet with a constellation of war satellites and plan to enslave your species . We were wondering if you might write our brochure . " <p> The voice was bogus robo-talk and I figured it was a friend of mine joking around . But then came a knock at the door . It was the aliens ready to talk business . They did n't care about my schedule , offering only general remarks about making it " worth my during . " I think they meant " while . " <p> I could n't very well keep them standing in the hallway . They looked like six-foot slugs and smelled of cheap incense and burnt coffee . What would the neighbors think ? I let them in and they sort of slipped and sloshed their way into my sharp little home office . As soon as they were settled , they brought up the idea of doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn way . " <p> " Not in a million years could a brochure even begin to accomplish your objectives . That kind of worldwide endeavor clearly requires billboards , TV spots , direct mailers , print ads , in addition to several brochures . Not to mention a Web site , " I told them . <p> They were eating it up . Literally . I had to stop them before they devoured the last of my mock-up samples . I sensed that budget was n't an issue . " You certainly came to the right person , " I said confidently . " Now , <p> I think you will need to lose the planetary takeover ' language . In today 's market , that 's not going to fly . People want cooperation , not colonization . " Think in terms of service , " I urged them . " Global conquest aside , what do you have to offer consumers ? " <p> The question seemed to perplex them , although it 's hard to be sure . Each of their ten thousand eyes darted back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly , these were not the decision makers of the species . Christ , I hate middle management . <p> They said they would have to get back to me on my ideas about an international advertising blitzkrieg . <p> After they left and I was mopping up their goo , I could n't stop shaking my head . In all my years , I had never seen a more naive group of clientele . What in the world , I wondered aloud , did they think a single brochure could possibly accomplish ? Here they are , a vast conglomerate of the universe 's higher intelligence , and they believed throwing a couple thousand into a glossy throwaway document would serve them Planet Earth on a saucer . It really makes you wonder about the state of marketing in other galaxies . <p> They were total boneheads , but I resigned myself to holding their anterior tentacles through the process - not literally , I hoped . My association with their organization could lead to innumerable other accounts for me , and I 've certainly had worse projects . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst thing that would happen to me is I go back to writing direct-mail campaigns about saving the endangered fruit fly or something . Hey , it 's a living . <p> Soon I was asked to come visit their " ship , " at 101 Market , downtown . It looked like any other glass and marble monument to the almighty dollar , although I would swear none of it had been there the week before . The lower floors were populated with what appeared by all signs to be human beings . <p> " Renters , " I was told when I inquired . " In this real estate market , who could resist ? " <p> The top floors were restricted access , and that 's where the aliens were making themselves at home . They had an unconventional style of housekeeping , to put it mildly . Let 's just say I was n't going to be wearing those pumps ever again . <p> " We 've thought about your branding ideas , and we are intrigued by the prospects , " the new VP of marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Also , we are making a killing at the stock market , so our plan to throw your world into chaos is , for the moment , on the back reactor . " <p> " We are having some trouble with the service question , " a highranking manager added . " We can not seem to uncover what it is we can offer your consumer . " <p> I explained that 's not really my specialty . " But just off the top of my head , I would say focus on your unique potential . Like , for example , do you guys do any cool tricks ? " <p> " Cool tricks ? " They got really hung up on that one . Imagine a boardroom with everyone throwing each other looks and multiply it by forty thousand eyes . I could n't get a read at all . <p> " Yeah , like can you cook an egg by just looking at it ? Or maybe read minds ? " <p> More looks . <p> " Forget that , how about trying to solve some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raise the dead , or anything like that ? You see , if you could just cure cancer , you would not only be stinking rich but also very , very popular . That may not matter to you guys , but it 's bloody good PR . " <p> " PR ? " <p> " It stands for public relations . " I could see they had no idea what I was talking about , but I moved on . I was not about to start explaining the vagaries of that field . <p> " Maybe you can leverage your advanced technology in IT or telecom . If all else fails , you can always sell weaponry . Even if our world seems fairly peaceful , I assure you , there is always a market for killing machines . " <p> " Would n't that mean giving humans the means to defend yourselves against our kind ? " one young slug asked . <p> " Not necessarily , " I responded with authority , quieting a gurgling murmur of suspicion . " There are ways to make a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been doing it for years . But what you folks need is a consultant . As a writer , words , not weapons , are my arsenal . " <p> I gave them a few names and told them to give me a call when they got to the copywriting stage . How did these things survive for two minutes in space ? <p> On my way down , an unfamiliar feeling came over me which I later recognized as the first inkling of fear . Even slower , it dawned on me why the creeping trepidation . On the conference table , spread amongst the half-chewed papers , was a book , the disturbing title of which was just coming into focus . One of those monsters was reading either a self-help manual or , equally bad , a recipe book . <p> The title : Earthling Soup for the Soul . <p> For the first time in my life , I faced a grave quandary . I had been going along for years putting words in the mouths of forest-tapers , slave-shop sport shoe-makers , and destroyers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had always known that all is fair in business , that progress will go forward with or without me , and that I 'd rather be writing credit card pitches to teenagers than monitoring the fry basket at Burger Queen . <p> I simply knew myself , and I knew what I needed first and foremost was a six-figure income . I lived for the best things in life . I did not design this world , but I was going to thrive in it . <p> This new account , however , required more than merely acting as an inevitable cog in a vast machinery of evil . I was actually playing a key role in the potential overthrow of human sovereignty . <p> Okay , that was n't what really bothered me . The real bug in my bonnet was the idea that these things looked at humans not just as a civilization to be conquered or a market to be exploited , but as .. well .. food ! I thought I would be insulated from the consequences of their conquest , but now I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite . <p> So I came to Margaritaville here . I doubt those goo balls will bother with this inconsequential island . I feel relatively safe and I 've actually been getting a lot of writing done , here on the beach . At first it seemed so inconvenient , to be displaced by some icky aliens . I 'm like a club med refugee ! But I finally came to see that I have the makings of a blockbuster here . Think of it , my story will launch a whole new genre : the science fiction memoir . I 'm sitting on publishing gold , my friend , just between you and me . <p> IMG
