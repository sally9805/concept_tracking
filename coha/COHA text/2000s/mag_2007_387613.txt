Headnote A plagiarism // All mankind is of one author , and is one volume ; when one man dies , one chapter is not torn out of the book , but translated into a better language ; and every chapter must be so translated . . . . - John Donne LOVE AND THEFT Consider this tale : a cultivated man of middle age looks back on the story of an amour fou , one beginning when , traveling abroad , he takes a room as a lodger . The moment he sees the daughter of the house , he is lost . She is a preteen , whose charms instantly enslave him . Heedless of her age , he becomes intimate with her . In the end she dies , and the narrator-marked by her forever-remains alone . The name of the girl supplies the title of the story : Loilta . The author of the story I 've described , Heinz von Lichberg , published his tale of Lolita in 1916 , forty years before Vladimir Nabokov 's novel . Lichberg later became a prominent journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from view . Did Nabokov , who remained in Berlin until 1937 , adopt Lichberg 's tale consciously ? Or did the earlier tale exist for Nabokov as a hidden , unacknowledged memory ? The history of literature is not without examples of this phenomenon , called cryptomnesia . Another hypothesis is that Nabokov , knowing Lichberg 's tale perfectly well , had set himself to that art of quotation that Thomas Mann , himself a master of it , called " higher cribbing . " Literature has always been a crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast . Little of what we admire in Nabokov 's Lolita is to be found in its predecessor ; the former is in no way deducible from the latter . Still : did Nabokov consciously borrow and quote ? " When you live outside the law , you have to eliminate dishonesty . " The line comes from Don Siegel 's 1958 film noir , The Lineup , written by Stirling Silliphant . The film still haunts revival houses , likely thanks to Eli Wallach 's blazing portrayal of a sociopathic hit man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet what were those words worth-to Siegel , or Silliphant , or their audience-in 1958 ? And again : what was the line worth when Bob Dylan heard it ( presumably in some Greenwich Village repertory cinema ) , cleaned it up a little , and inserted it into " Absolutely Sweet Marie " ? What are they worth now , to the culture at large ? Appropriation has always played a key role in Dylan 's music . The songwriter has grabbed not only from a panoply of vintage Hollywood films but from Shakespeare and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Junichi Saga 's Confessions of a Yakuza . He also nabbed the title of Eric Lott 's study of minstrelsy for his 2001 album Love and Theft . One imagines Dylan liked the general resonance of the tide , in which emotional misdemeanors stalk the sweetness of love , as they do so often in Dylan 's songs . Lott 's title is , of course , itself a riff on Leslie Fiedler 's Love and Death in the American Novel , which famously identifies the literary motif of the interdependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huck and Jim or Ishmael and Queequeg-a series of nested references to Dylan 's own appropriating , minstrel-boy self . Dylan 's art offers a paradox : while it famously urges us not to look back , it also encodes a knowledge of past sources that might otherwise have little home in contemporary culture , like the Civil War poetry of the Confederate bard Henry Timrod , resuscitated in lyrics on Dylan 's newest record , Modem Times . Dylan 's originality and his appropriations are as one . The same might be said of ail art . I realized this forcefully when one day I went looking for the John Donne passage quoted above . I know the lines , I confess , not from a college course but from the movie version of 84 , Charing Cross Road with Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft . I checked out 84 , Charing Cross Road from the library in the hope of finding the Donne passage , but it was n't in the book . It 's alluded to in the play that was adapted from the book , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was the passage , read in voiceover by Anthony Hopkins but without attribution . Unfortunately , the line was also abridged so that , when I finally turned to the Web , I found myself searching for the line " all mankind is of one volume " instead of " all mankind is of one author , and is one volume . " My Internet search was initially no more successful than my library search . I had thought that summoning books from the vasty deep was a matter of a few keystrokes , but when I visited the website of the Yale library , I found that most of its books do n't yet exist as computer text . As a last-ditch effort I searched the seemingly more obscure phrase " every chapter must be so translated . " The passage I wanted finally came to me , as it turns out , not as part of a scholarly library collection but simply because someone who loves Donne had posted it on his homepage . The lines I sought were from Meditation 17 in Devotions upon Emergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donne ever wrote , containing as it does the line " never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee . " My search had led me from a movie to a book to a play to a website and back to a book . Then again , those words may be as famous as they are only because Hemingway lifted them for his book title . Literature has been in a plundered , fragmentary state for a long time . When I was thirteen I purchased an anthology of Beat writing . Immediately , and to my very great excitement , I discovered one William S. Burroughs , author of something called Naked Lunch , excerpted there in all its coruscating brilliance . Burroughs was then as radical a literary man as the world had to offer . Nothing , in all my experience of literature since , has ever had as strong an effect on my sense of the sheer possibilities of writing . Later , attempting to understand this impact , I discovered that Burroughs had incorporated snippets of other writers ' texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have called plagiarism . Some of these borrowings had been lifted from American science fiction of the Forties and Fifties , adding a secondary shock of recognition for me . By then I knew that this " cut-up method , " as Burroughs called it , was central to whatever he thought he was doing , and that he quite literally believed it to be akin to magic . When he wrote about his process , the hairs on my neck stood up , so palpable was the excitement . Burroughs was interrogating the universe with scissors and a paste pot , and the least imitative of authors was no plagiarist at all . CONTAMINATION ANXIETY In 1941 , on his front porch , Muddy Waters recorded a song for the folklorist Alan Lomax . After singing the song , which he told Lomax was entitled " Country Blues , " Waters described how he came to write it . " I made it on about the eighth of October ' ' 38 , " Waters said . " I was fixin " a puncture on a car . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , and the song fell into my mind and it come to me just like that and I started singing . " Then Lomax , who knew of the Robert Johnson recording called " Walkin " Blues , " asked Waters if there were any other songs that used the same tune . " There 's been some blues played like that , " Waters replied . " This song comes from the cotton field and a boy once put a record out-Robert Johnson . He put it out as named " Walkin ' Blues . " I heard the tune before I heard it on the record . I learned it from Son House . " In nearly one breath , Waters offers five accounts : his own active authorship : he " made it " on a specific date . Then the " passive " explanation : " it come to me just like that . " After Lomax raises the question of influence , Waters , without shame , misgivings , or trepidation , says that he heard a version by Johnson , but that his mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of that complex genealogy , Waters declares that " this song comes from the cotton field . " Blues and jazz musicians have long been enabled by a kind of " open source " culture , in which pre-existing melodic fragments and larger musical frameworks are freely reworked . Technology has only multiplied the possibilities ; musicians have gained the power to duplicate sounds literally rather than simply approximate them through allusion . In Seventies Jamaica , King Tubby and Lee " Scratch " Perry deconstructed recorded music , using astonishingly primitive pre-digital hardware , creating what they called " versions . " The recombinant nature of their means of production quickly spread to DJs in New York and London . Today an endless , gloriously impure , and fundamentally social process generates countless hours of music . Visual , sound , and text collagewhich for many centuries were relatively fugitive traditions ( a cento here , a folk pastiche there ) - became explosively central to a series of movements in the twentieth century : futurism , cubism , Dada , musique concrte , situationism , pop art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominator in that list , might be called the art form of the twentieth century , never mind the twenty-first . But forget , for the moment , chronologies , schools , or even centuries . As examples accumulate-Igor Stravinsky 's music and Daniel Johnston 's , Francis Bacon 's paintings and Henry Darger 's , the novels of the Oulipo group and of Hannah Crafts ( the author who pillaged Dickens 's Bleak House to write The Bondwoman 's Narrative ) , as well as cherished texts that become troubling to their admirers after the discovery of their " plagiarized " elements , like Richard Condon 's novels or Martin Luther King Jr . ' s sermons-it becomes apparent that appropriation , mimicry , quotation , allusion , and sublimated collaboration consist of a kind of sine qua non of the creative act , cutting across all forms and genres in the realm of cultural production . In a courtroom scene from The Simpsons that has since entered into the television canon , an argument over the ownership of the animated characters Itchy and Scratchy rapidly escalates into an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built on plagiarism ! " declares the show 's hot-tempered **33;1380;TOOLONG , Roger Meyers Jr . " You take away our right to steal ideas , where are they going to come from ? " If nostalgic cartoonists had never borrowed from Fritz the Cat , there would he no Ren &; Stimpy Show ; without the Rankin/Bass and Charlie Brown Christmas specials , there would be no South Park ; and without The Flintstones-more or less The Honeymooners in cartoon loincloths-The Simpsons would cease to exist . If those do n't strike you as essential losses , then consider the remarkable series of " plagiarisms " that links Ovid 's " Pyramus and Thisbe " with Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet and Leonard Bernstein 's West Side Story , or Shakespeare 's description of Cleopatra , copied nearly verbatim from Plutarch 's life of Mark Antony and also later nicked by T. S. Eliot for The Waste Land . If these are examples of plagiarism , then we want more plagiarism . Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists are converted to art by art itself . Finding one 's voice is n't just an emptying and purifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations , communities , and discourses . Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced . Invention , it must be humbly admitted , does not consist in creating out of void but out of chaos . Any artist knows these truths , no matter how deeply he or she submerges that knowing . What happens when an allusion goes unrecognized ? A closer look at The Waste Land may help make this point . The body of Eliot 's poem is a vertiginous mlange of quotation , allusion , and " original " writing . When Eliot alludes to Edmund Spenser 's " Prothalamion " with the line " Sweet Thames , run softly , till I end my song , " what of readers to whom the poem , never one of Spenser 's most popular , is unfamiliar ? ( Indeed , the Spenser is now known largely because of Eliot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant the line to Eliot , or later discover the source and understand the line as plagiarism . Eliot evidenced no small anxiety about these matters ; the notes he so carefully added to The Waste Land can be read as a symptom of modernism 's contamination anxiety . Taken from this angle , what exactly is postmodernism , except modernism without the anxiety ? SURROUNDED BY SIGNS The surrealists believed that objects in the world possess a certain but unspecifiable intensity that had been dulled by everyday use and utility . They meant to reanimate this dormant intensity , to bring their minds once again into close contact with the matter that made up their world . Andr Breton 's maxim " Beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table " is an expression of the belief that simply placing objects in an unexpected context reinvigorates their mysterious qualities . This " crisis " the surrealists identified was being simultaneously diagnosed by others . Martin Heidegger held that the essence of modernity was found in a certain technological orientation he called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects in our world only in terms of how they can serve us or be used by us . The task he identified was to find ways to resituate ourselves visa-vis these " objects , " so that we may see them as " things " pulled into relief against the ground of their functionality . Heidegger believed that art had the great potential to reveal the " thingness " of objects . The surrealists understood that photography and cinema could carry out this reanimating process automatically ; the process of framing objects in a lens was often enough to create the charge they sought . Describing the effect , Walter Benjamin drew a comparison between the photographic apparatus and Freud 's psychoanalytic methods . Just as Freud 's theories " isolated and made analyzable things which had heretofore floated along unnoticed in the broad stream of perception , " the photographic apparatus focuses on " hidden details of familiar objects , " revealing " entirely new structural formations of the subject . " It 's worth noting , then , that early in the history of photography a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art : courts were asked whether the photographer , amateur or professional , required permission before he could capture and print an image . Was the photographer stealing from the person or building whose photograph he shot , pirating something of private and certifiable value ? Those early decisions went in favor of the pirates . Just as Walt Disney could take inspiration from Buster Keaton 's Steamboat Bill , Jr. , the Brothers Grimm , or the existence of real mice , the photographer should be free to capture an image without compensating the source . The world that meets our eye through the lens of a camera was judged to be , with minor exceptions , a sort of public commons , where a cat may look at a king . Novelists may glance at the stuff of the world too , but we sometimes get called to task for it . For those whose ganglia were formed pre-TV , the mimetic deployment of pop-culture icons seems at best an annoying tic and at worst a dangerous vapidity that compromises fiction 's seriousness by dating it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graduate workshop I briefly passed through , a certain gray eminence tried to convince us that a literary story should always eschew " any feature which serves to date it " because " serious fiction must be Timeless . " When we protested that , in his own well-known work , characters moved about electrically lit rooms , drove cars , and spoke not Anglo-Saxon but postwar English-and further , that fiction he 'd himself ratified as great , such as Dickens , was liberally strewn with innately topical , commercial , and timebound references-he impatiently amended his proscription to those explicit references that would date a story in the " frivolous Now . " When pressed , he said of course he meant the " trendy masspopular-media " reference . Here , transgenerational discourse broke down . I was born in 1964 ; I grew up watching Captain Kangaroo , moon landings , zillions of TV ads , the Banana Splits , M*A*S*H , and The Mary Tyler Moore Show . I was born with words in my mouth- " Band-Aid , " " Q-tip , " " Xerox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " taxicab " and " toothbrush . " The world is a home littered with pop-culture products and their emblems . I also came of age swamped by parodies that stood for originals yet mysterious to me-I knew Monkees before Beatles , Belmondo before Bogart , and " remember " the movie Summer of ' ' 42 from a Mad magazine satire , though I 've still never seen the film itself . I 'm not alone in having been born backward into an incoherent realm of texts , products , and images , the commercial and cultural environment with which we 've both supplemented and blotted out our natural world . I can no more claim it as " mine " than the sidewalks and forests of the world , yet I do dwell in it , and for me to stand a chance as either artist or citizen , I 'd probably better be permitted to name it . Consider Walker Percy 's The Moviegoer : Other people , so I have read , treasure memorable moments in their lives : the time one climbed the Parthenon at sunrise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Park and achieved with her a sweet and natural relationship , as they say in books . I too once met a girl in Central Park , but it is not much to remember . What I remember is the time John Wayne killed three men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in Stage ' coach , and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the doorway in The Third Man . Today , when we can eat Tex-Mex with chopsticks while listening to reggae and watching a YouTube rebroadcast of the Berlin Wall 's falli.e. , when damn near everything presents itself as familiar-it 's not a surprise that some of today 's most ambitious art is going about trying to make the familiar strange . In so doing , in reimagining what human life might truly be like over there across the chasms of illusion , mediation , demographics , marketing , imago , and appearance , artists are paradoxically trying to restore what 's taken for " real " to three whole dimensions , to reconstruct a univocally round world out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastelessness or trademark violation may be attached to the artistic appropriation of the media environment in which we swim , the alternative-to flinch , or tiptoe away into some ivory tower of irrelevance-is far worse . We 're surrounded by signs ; our imperative is to ignore none of them . USEMONOPOLY The idea that culture can be property-intellectual property-is used to justify everything from attempts to force the Girl Scouts to pay royalties for singing songs around campfires to the infringement suit brought by the estate of Margaret Mitchell against the publishers of Alice Randall 's The Wind Done Gone . Corporations like Celera Genomics have filed for patents for human genes , while the Recording Industry Association of America has sued music downloaders for copyright infringement , reaching out-of-court settlements for thousands of dollars with defendants as young as twelve . ASCAP bleeds fees from shop owners who play background music in their stores ; students and scholars are shamed from placing texts facedown on photocopy machines . At the same time , copyright is revered by most established writers and artists as a birthright and bulwark , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapacious world . Plagiarism and piracy , after all , are the monsters we working artists are taught to dread , as they roam the woods surrounding our tiny preserves of regard and remuneration . A time is marked not so much by ideas that are argued about as by ideas that are taken for granted . The character of an era hangs upon what needs no defense . In this regard , few of us question the contemporary construction of copyright . It is taken as a law , both in the sense of a universally recognizable moral absolute , like the law against murder , and as naturally inherent in our world , like the law of gravity . In fact , it is neither . Rather , copyright is an ongoing social negotiation , tenuously forged , endlessly revised , and imperfect in its every incarnation . Thomas Jefferson , for one , considered copyright a necessary evil : he favored providing just enough incentive to create , nothing more , and thereafter allowing ideas to flow freely , as nature intended . His conception of copyright was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . " This was a balancing act between creators and society as a whole ; second comers might do a much better job than the originator with the original idea . But Jefferson 's vision has not fared well , has in fact been steadily eroded by those who view the culture as a market in which everything of value should be owned by someone or other . The distinctive feature of modern American copyright law is its almost limitless bloating-its expansion in both scope and duration . With no registration requirement , every creative act in a tangible medium is now subject to copyright protection : your email to your child or your child 's finger painting , both are automatically protected . The first Congress to grant copyright gave authors an initial term of fourteen years , which could be renewed for another fourteen if the author still lived . The current term is the life of the author plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that each time Mickey Mouse is about to fall into the public domain , the mouse 's copyright term is extended . Even as the law becomes more restrictive , technology is exposing those restrictions as bizarre and arbitrary . When old laws fixed on reproduction as the compensable ( or actionable ) unit , it was n't because there was anything fundamentally invasive of an author 's rights in the making of a copy . Rather it was because copies were once easy to find and count , so they made a useful benchmark for deciding when an owner 's rights had been invaded . In the contemporary world , though , the act of " copying " is in no meaningful sense equivalent to an infringement-we make a copy every time we accept an emailed text , or send or forward one-and is impossible anymore to regulate or even describe . At the movies , my entertainment is sometimes lately preceded by a dire trailer , produced by the lobbying group called the Motion Picture Association of America , in which the purchasing of a bootleg copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car or a handbag-and , as the bullying supertitles remind us , " You would n't steal a handbag ! " This conflation forms an incitement to quit thinking . If I were to tell you that pirating DVDs or downloading music is in no way different from loaning a friend a book , my own arguments would be as ethically bankrupt as the MPAA 's . The truth lies somewhere in the vast gray area between these two overstated positions . For a car or a handbag , once stolen , no longer is available to its owner , while the appropriation of an article of " intellectual property " leaves the original untouched . As Jefferson wrote , " He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me . " Yet industries of cultural capital , who profit not from creating but from distributing , see the sale of culture as a zero-sum game . The pianoroll publishers fear the record companies , who fear the cassette-tape manufacturers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is next in line to profit most quickly from the intangible and infinitely reproducible fruits of an artist 's labor . It has been the same in every industry and with every technological innovation . Jack Valenti , speaking for the MPAA : " I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone . " Thinking clearly sometimes requires unbraiding our language . The word " copyright " may eventually seem as dubious in its embedded purposes as " family values , " " globalization , " and , sure , " intellectual property . " <p>
