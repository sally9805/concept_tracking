<p> For an installation that generates about 10 percent of California 's electricity , the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near here seems remarkably unobtrusive . <p> Tucked between the wide Pacific and hills burgeoning with vernal greenery and grazing livestock , it 's smaller than one might expect . <p> But some scientists and nuclear power critics claim this tranquil tableau is deceptive . Because of the threat of terrorist attack , they say , Diablo Canyon , which is owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. , is capable of generating a truly diabolical scenario : A huge release of radiation that could dwarf Chernobyl and render thousands of square miles of the state uninhabitable for years  --  perhaps decades or centuries . <p> Two nationally known scientists say the plant 's spent nuclear fuel storage is vulnerable to terrorist attack . At that facility are two pools of water that collectively contain about 2,200 old " fuel assemblies "  --  packs of refined uranium that are no longer useful for power generation but are still highly radioactive . <p> " The consequences of a spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Von Hippel , a physicist and professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University . <p> An article describing the possible consequences of terrorist attacks on spent nuclear fuel pools is scheduled to appear later this spring in Science and Global Security , a Princeton journal . <p> A draft of the paper was released earlier this year . <p> The article , which has been reviewed by other eminent scientists , was written by several nuclear facilities experts , including Von Hippel and Gordon Thompson , the director of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies , a nonprofit group based in Cambridge , Mass. , that analyzes threats to national and international security . <p> Both Von Hippel and Thompson said the high density fuel pools at Diablo Canyon made the plant vulnerable to a terrorist attack that could release clouds of deadly material . <p> " Basically , " Von Hippel said , " you 're talking about an event that would force the long-term abandonment of an area roughly the size of New Jersey . " <p> PLANTS ON TARGET LIST <p> The possible nightmarish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is also something that terrorists have apparently already thought of . <p> Recently , on the CBS News program " 60 Minutes II , " Yosri Fouda , a reporter for the Arabic news network Al Jazeera , said that when he interviewed last spring the recently captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , suspected architect of the Sept. 11 attacks , Mohammed said that al Qaeda 's first choice of a target was nuclear " facilities " in the U.S. But it was soon " taken off the list for fear it might get out ( of ) hand , " Fouda told the CBS News program . <p> Diablo Canyon 's critics point out that the pools are not protected by a containment structure , as are the two reactors where power is generated  --  even though the pools contain far more hard radiation than the two reactor cores , each of which houses only 193 assemblies . The pools are below ground , under a building that is less fortified than the structures that protect the reactors . <p> If the pools are breached by a terrorist attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel assemblies . These would then self-ignite and send up huge plumes of radioactive isotopes . <p> In preparing the report , Von Hippel said they had analyzed the pool containment protocols of plants around the nation . They also said they were aware of Diablo Canyon and its fuel pools and the possibility of terrorist attack . <p> Diablo Canyon is " most certainly " on a list of possible terrorist targets compiled by the California attorney general 's office , a state official said on condition of anonymity . <p> " The list does n't rank the targets like a top 100 or anything , " the official said . " It just groups them  --  bridges , law enforcement agency buildings , railroads and so forth . But let 's face it : We 're talking about a large nuclear power plant here . " <p> BOEING-PROOF <p> Most nuclear engineers think it would be difficult , if not impossible , for a large airliner to score a hit on Diablo Canyon 's pools . <p> Last year , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission concluded that fuel storage pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mph without coolant loss . <p> PG &E; engineers point out that the pools are situated between the reactor containment domes  --  which are 3 1/2 feet thick , and fabricated of concrete and steel  --  and steep hillsides , making them an extremely difficult target . Multiple rings of concrete barriers on access roadways and numerous guards armed with assault rifles further make the possibility of a successful terrorist attack remote , they say . <p> In addition , the 40-foot-deep pools are protected along the sides and bottom by thick layers of concrete and stainless steel . Coolant leakage would therefore be most unlikely , they say , even in the event of an attack or large earthquake . <p> But dissenting analysts think terrorists wielding explosive missiles or flying small , maneuverable planes packed with high explosives could get through where a big commercial aircraft could n't . <p> " Certainly , with enough explosives , a spent fuel pool could be penetrated , " said NRC spokesman Victor Dricks . " Damage would be dependent on the scenario . But even with penetration , measures are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The critics say the threat to the plant is real  --  and is compounded by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 's decision to allow PG &E; to store more fuel assemblies in the pools than allowed by the original license . " The pools were originally designed to hold just a few years of fuel discharge , until a permanent federal repository could be built , " said Gordon Thompson , one of the authors of the Princeton paper . <p> CHEAPEST OPTION <p> Because no repository has been constructed , said Thompson , nuclear plant operators went with the cheapest option , which has become the industry norm : high-density rackings of fuel assemblies in the pools . <p> But if there is a loss of coolant , Thompson said , recently stored " ultra hot " assemblies would catch fire in a few hours , which would then ignite cooler  --  although still extremely radioactive  --  assemblies . <p> " The fire could not be extinguished at that point , simply because it could not be approached due to the extreme radioactivity , " said Thompson , a co-author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel storage systems since 1978 . <p> In such a scenario , Thompson calculates , between 10 and 100 percent of the fuel 's cesium 137  --  an extremely volatile isotope  --  would be released . Cesium 137 accounted for most of the contamination when one of the four reactors at Chernobyl , northwest of Kiev , melted down in April 1986 . <p> At Diablo Canyon , winds typically blow from the west and north . If a fuel fire occurred during usual wind conditions , said Thompson , thousands of square miles of the south coast would be intensely contaminated for decades . <p> " The only solution would be permanent evacuation , " he said . <p> DEFENSES ANALYZED <p> In a recent report commissioned by the Citizens Awareness Network , a Massachusetts organization that studies nuclear contamination , among other things , Thompson analyzed likely modes of terrorist attack on civilian nuclear facilities , including commando assaults , truck bombs , anti-tank missiles , commercial aircraft and explosive-laden small aircraft . <p> In that report , he concludes that the defenses typical for nuclear plants  --  guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers  --  are sufficient to stop only commando assaults and truck bombs . <p> But PG &E; officials say generic statements about nuclear facilities do n't necessarily apply to Diablo Canyon . <p> At a viewing pavilion above the plant , L. Jearl Strickland , Diablo Canyon 's program manager for used-fuels storage , pointed to the spent fuel storage pool building below . <p> " It would be virtually impossible to hit that with an aircraft , " he said . " The reactor containment structures protect it from the west . To the east , the topography of the land and transmission lines prevent a practical approach . Concrete buildings shield it from the south and north . " <p> Strickland said the forthcoming Science and Global Security paper by Thompson , Von Hippel and several other analysts was too broad in scope to be applicable . " You have to be site specific , or your conclusions will simply be erroneous , " he said . " The basic topography of the terrain here provides tremendous protection . " <p> In the event of a land attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists to get close enough to do any damage . Such an attack would be handled by PG &E's; security staff , who company representatives say are highly trained and armed with AR-15 semiautomatic rifles and 9mm pistols . According to PG &E; company spokesman Jeff Lewis , Diablo Canyon has been required to implement about 30 security upgrades since Sept. 11 , 2001 . <p> SECURITY UPGRADED <p> " We ca n't talk about specifics such as new weapons , but security has definitely been tightened since the World Trade Center attacks , " said Lewis . " We own 13,000 acres around the plant , and I 've heard talk that people could penetrate our outside perimeter . That may be . But as you get closer to the plant , the security tightens concentrically . " <p> Local law enforcement agencies could offer only limited assistance in the event of an attack . <p> " We 've been guarding ( Diablo Canyon 's ) gates since 9/11 , " said California Highway Patrol Officer Mike Poelking . " We 've had three additional officers assigned to us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , and I do n't see it ending anytime soon . " <p> Poelking said his agency also flew air patrols regularly over Diablo Canyon . <p> In any case , PG &E; needs an alternative method for storing its spent fuel because the pools will fill within a few years . <p> The company is seeking permission to transfer some assemblies to special stainless steel and concrete casks . Although the assemblies will still be extremely radioactive after five years in the pools , said Strickland , they would no longer be capable of self-igniting , and hence would be safe to store in the casks . <p> Each cask would hold 32 assemblies and would weigh about 175 tons . They would be stored on an open air pad about the size of a football field above the plant , where they would stay until a permanent federal repository for high level nuclear waste is built  --  such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain in Nevada . At that point , they would be transferred to the permanent dump . <p> Strickland said Diablo Canyon eventually would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant would generate under its current licensing plans . <p> But such " dry casks " also may be vulnerable to attack . <p> URBAN NUCLEAR DUMP <p> " Basically , they 're creating a high-level nuclear waste dump in a densely populated coastal area , " said Klaus Schumann , a member of the Green Party and San Luis Obispo County 's Nuclear Waste Management Committee . " They 're calling it a temporary site , but it could easily become permanent . It is n't at all clear if Yucca Mountain or any other permanent federal repository will be built . " <p> Experts have studied the vulnerability of dry casks to attack , and their conclusions vary . <p> Marvin Resnikoff , an engineer with Radioactive Waste Management Associates , a New York consulting group , analyzed the impact of a Boeing 757 on one variety of cask that is employed by some utilities to store used-fuel assemblies . <p> He concluded that planes traveling at 500 mph  --  roughly the speed of the airliners that crashed into the World Trade Center towers  --  would penetrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simplified approach and did n't use the type of cask that would be employed at Diablo Canyon . <p> The maker of that cask has concluded its product could withstand a direct impact from a large-body aircraft without rupturing , Strickland said . <p> Von Hippel advocates implementing a cask program and reducing the densities of spent fuel in pools . " That would definitely reduce the risk , " he said . <p> There is also controversy over whether the casks are safer collected on one large pad , as planned  --  which PG &E; says makes them easier to guard  --  or whether it is better to distribute them among several smaller pads , which PG &E's; critics say lessens the likelihood of a catastrophic release of radiation . <p> In the final analysis , security at nuclear plants can be improved , but not made foolproof . <p> " We 're constantly looking at ways to improve security , " said Dricks , of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . " Each of the national alert stages ( employed since Sept. 11 ) requires nuclear facility security upgrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants do that . We have inspectors on site . " <p> But Von Hippel said safeguards were still inadequate at most plants  --  including Diablo Canyon . " Given the horrific consequences of a ( pool ) fire , " he said , " we have to do everything we can to protect against one . " <p> E-mail Glen Martin at **26;55;TOOLONG
