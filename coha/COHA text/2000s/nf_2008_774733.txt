The Path Back // As I stepped down onto the tarmac at Quaid-e-Azam International Airport in Karachi on October 18 , 2007 , I was overcome with emotion . Like most women in politics , I am especially sensitive to maintaining my composure , to never showing my feelings . A display of emotion by a woman in politics or government can be misconstrued as a manifestation of weakness , reinforcing stereotypes and caricatures . But as my foot touched the ground of my beloved Pakistan for the first time after eight lonely and difficult years of exile , I could not stop the tears from pouring from my eyes and I lifted my hands in reverence , in thanks , and in prayer . I stood on the soil of Pakistan in awe . I felt that a huge burden , a terrible weight , had been lifted from my shoulders . It was a sense of liberation . I was home at long last . I knew why . I knew what I had to do . // I had departed three hours earlier from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to stay behind in Dubai with our two daughters , Bakhtawar and Aseefa . Asif and I had made a very calculated , difficult decision . We understood the dangers and the risks of my return , and we wanted to make sure that no matter what happened , our daughters and our son , Bilawal ( at college at Oxford ) , would have a parent to take care of them . It was a discussion that few husbands and wives ever have to have , thankfully . But Asif and I had become accustomed to a life of sacrificing our personal happiness and any sense of normalcy and privacy . Long ago I had made my choice . The people of Pakistan have always come first . The people of Pakistan will always come first . My children understood it and not only accepted it but encouraged me . As we said good-bye , I turned to the group of assembled supporters and press and said what was in my heart : " This is the beginning of a long journey for Pakistan back to democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . We must believe that miracles can happen . " // The stakes could not have been higher . Pakistan under military dictatorship had become the epicenter of an international terrorist movement that had two primary aims . First , the extremists ' aim to reconstitute the concept of the caliphate , a political state encompassing the great Ummah ( Muslim community ) populations of the world , uniting the Middle East , the Persian Gulf states , South Asia , Central Asia , East Asia , and parts of Africa . And second , the militants ' aim to provoke a clash of civilizations between the West and an interpretation of Islam that rejects pluralism and modernity . The goal  --  the great hope of the militants  --  is a collision , an explosion between the values of the West and what the extremists claim to be the values of Islam . // Within the Muslim world there has been and continues to be an internal rift , an often violent confrontation among sects , ideologies , and interpretations of the message of Islam . This destructive tension has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured intra-Islamic relations for 1,300 years . This sectarian conflict stifled the brilliance of the Muslim renaissance that took place during the Dark Ages of Europe , when the great universities , scientists , doctors , and artists were all Muslim . Today that intra-Muslim sectarian violence is most visibly manifest in a senseless , self-defeating sectarian civil war that is tearing modern Iraq apart at its fragile seams and exercising its brutality in other parts of the world , especially in parts of Pakistan . // And as the Muslim world  --  where sectarianism is rampant  --  simmers internally , extremists have manipulated Islamic dogma to justify and rationalize a so-called jihad against the West . The attacks on September 11 , 2001 , heralded the vanguard of the caliphate-inspired dream of bloody confrontation ; the Crusades in reverse . And as images of the twin towers burning and then imploding were on every television set in the world , the attack was received in two disparate ways in the Muslim world . Much , if not most , of the Muslim world reacted with horror , embarrassment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history had been carried out by Muslims in the name of Allah and jihad . Yet there was also another reaction , a troubling and disquieting one : Some people danced in the streets of Palestine . Sweets were exchanged by others in Pakistan and Bangladesh . Condemnations were few in the world 's largest Muslim nation , Indonesia . The hijackers of September 11 seemed to touch a nerve of Muslim impotence . The burning and then collapsing towers represented , to some , resurgent Muslim power , a perverse Muslim payback for the domination of the West . To others it was a religious epiphany . And to still others it combined political , cultural , and religious assertiveness . A Pew comparative study of Muslims ' attitudes after the attacks found that people in many Muslim countries " think it is good that Americans now know what it is like to be vulnerable . " // One billion Muslims around the world seemed united in their outrage at the war in Iraq , damning the deaths of Muslims caused by U.S. military intervention without U.N . approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sectarian civil war , which has led to far more casualties . Obviously ( and embarrassingly ) , Muslim leaders , masses , and even intellectuals are quite comfortable criticizing outsiders for the harm inflicted on fellow Muslims , but there is deadly silence when they are confronted with Muslim-on-Muslim violence . That kind of criticism is not so politically convenient and certainly not politically correct . Even regarding Darfur , where there is an actual genocide being committed against a Muslim population , there has been a remarkable absence of protests , few objections , and no massive coverage on Arab or South Asian television . // We are all familiar with the data that pour forth from Western survey research centers and show an increasing contempt for and hostility to the West , and particularly the United States , in Muslim communities from Turkey to Pakistan . The war in Iraq is cited as a reason . The situation in Palestine is given as another reason . So-called decadent Western values are often part of the explanation . It is so much easier to blame others for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
