Marc Laidlaw appeared regularly in our pages in the " 80s and " 90s , but he was lured away from our field by the computer gaming industry . Now that Half-Life 2 has hit the stores , Marc has more time to focus on his fiction again , and in recent months he has published new work in Sci-Fiction and elsewhere . His latest story for us is a strange and compelling fable . <p> AT FIRST LITTLE HUGH thought it was rats . Rats in the wall by his head , down low on the floor where his mattress lay . He had seen them often enough , darting down the hall to the kitchen , and he came upon their nests in the narrow crawlspace where he sometimes went for privacy . He imagined their curved teeth gnawing away , almost the same stained yellow color as the crumbly plaster they chewed . His sister had always feared they would come in at night and eat them , but she did not wake to see if her dream would come true . Hugh alone watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He watched until the wall began to tremble , and a piece of it bent sideways and opened like a little door , hinged on the wallpaper . Out came not a rat , but a little brown man . Very little , very brown . His head barely reached the lower ledge of the windowsill . " Is this your house ? " the little brown man said . " You live here ? " Hugh twisted and looked over his shoulder to make sure his sister was still sleeping . She was . The rest of the house was quiet as well ; his parents often fell into a stupor long before Hugh could find his way to sleep . Some nights he never even closed his eyes , but lay awake with his head so empty that the darkness inside him and the darkness outside were exactly the same . That was very restful . But now , except for Hugh and this little intruder , everyone was asleep . " Who are you ? " Hugh whispered . " I asked you a question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Right , " said the little man , and turned to peer back at the hole he 'd made . " You wo n't fit through this . " " Why would I want to ? " " We need to get you out of here , under the house . Right away . " " Keep your voice down , " Hugh said , " you 'll wake my sister . And I 'm not going anywhere with you . Not ... not unless you tell me who you are . " " No names until we trust you . " " You trust me ? Why should I trust you ? " " Do you know Mbe'lmbe ? " " Umbaylumbay ? . Who 's he ? " " Foo . But it is not your fault you are such an ignorant child . If you knew the name , you would know that you can trust me . We have had secrecy forced upon us for so long , the world has forgotten us . Answer me this , boy . Is there another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You get there how ? " " There 's a piece of screen under the porch . I peel it back . " " Very well . Put on your shoes and go there . I will meet you and then we proceed . " " I 'm not that crazy . " " You can wear your pajamas - it 's warm enough where we 're headed . But shoes you may need . Now hurry . " Hugh plucked at the flannel pajamas that had been his solitary Christmas present , his solace on these bitter nights in the drafty little house . When he looked up again the flap of wallboard was swinging back into place . The little brown man was gone . Hugh 's dilemma . For the moment , he was free to do as he chose . Surely such a little man could n't force him to do anything he did n't want to do . It was up to Hugh himself whether he crawled into the cobwebby dark beneath the porch , or fell back into his pillow and tried to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheets lay thrown back . The bed was empty , Hugh 's decision made . " Well done , little man , " the little man greeted him from darkness as he scraped through the wire mesh . Hugh kept a candle stub and book of matches in his crawlspace nest . As the light flared , the man 's pupils glared briefly golden like a cat 's . " Now make haste with me . Our time is short . " In the middle of the crawlspace floor , the raw dirt had been pushed up in a gaping crater , a mole mound dug up from beneath . Into this , now , the little man lowered himself . One hand thrust up and beckoned back to Hugh . " It 's narrow here , but soon widens . " It was also dark . Putting his face above the opening , he felt a breeze coming up , strong enough to make the flame flutter . He expected the subterranean wind to carry a tomb smell , something as musty as the suffocating damp beneath the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cinnamon . Mint . The rich , dark , intoxicating scents of coffee , vanilla , and above all else , chocolate . The passage was crudely hewn by pick and shovel , hardly fit for a grave-tunneling ghoul , but the smell disarmed him . He dropped down easily , rock shards digging into his knees and palms . The candle went out during the descent . " This way , " said the voice in the dark , calling from the direction of the smells . " You wo n't need the light . There is no false turn you can make . And soon you will see well enough . " He followed the scrabbling sounds of toes and knees in earth . It was hard to breathe , with his head tucked low so that he would n't bang his forehead on the ceiling . When he stopped to catch his breath , the vapors that filled his nose and lungs were intoxicating . An intense miasma of candyshop smells : Licorice and lemon , caramelized sugar , a marshmallowy sponginess to the air . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the raw smell of the earth they stirred up as they scrambled . At last he realized he could see the silhouette of the little man ahead of him . The light was very dim and sourceless , and it stayed that way for the longest time , like twilight in a dream where it is always twilight . Even when it brightened , it could hardly be called bright , being only barely lighter than the palest dusk . And in that subterrene glow , he realized the little man was standing upright now and urging him to do the same . With his hand on his head like a protective cap , Hugh raised himself to full height , and found that the ceiling was now higher than he could reach . Their journey through the narrow passage finished , he wondered what kind of place he 'd come to . " Where are we ? " he asked . " Why have you brought me here ? " " We are home . " " Whose home ? " " Are you not a lonely , lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunken forest . As his eyes adjusted ever so slowly to the gloom , he saw looming shadows , blurred shapes like enormous trees that stirred not at all in the gentle sweet-scented wind . He reached out to touch a tall trunk , and his fingers sank into velvety softness until they reached something cold and hard as glass . He put his fingers to his nose , wondering if this was the source of sweetness , but the softness reeked of mildew , rot and mold , a trillion fetid spores disturbed by his questing fingers . He sneezed and stepped away . Was this the source of the velvety light that seemed to emanate from the very walls ? Did mold blanket every surface ? But what ... what had lain beneath the mold before it grew ? Why did the shapes cloaked in damp gray matter seem far too complex and convoluted to be explained away as the stalagmites and stalactites of even the most fantastical cavern ? Again , he asked , " What is this place ? " " Not yet , little man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sighed , exasperated , ready to refuse to budge . But at that instant , something lurched from the gray folds of moldy dimness . A chuckling sound turned whining and insistent . Sudden puffs of upset spores , far off in the dark , came steaming closer , like the chuffing plume of a gray locomotive rushing at them . His guide let out a muffled shriek and seized his hand and first pulled , then rushed around behind and shoved him forward . " Run ! " the little man hissed . " Run , run , run , run , run ! " The thing behind them advanced almost soundlessly , but Hugh could hear a gathering of soft explosions like puffs from a huge mouth . A blast of mold dust robbed him of sight . He shut his stinging eyes and staggered forward , only to find himself falling . Thick tepid mud enveloped him , acrid and foul , and also riddled with mold . He came up gasping , as beside him his sputtering host insisted , " Swim and we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the great river ! " So he swam . Struggling through thickness , he came at last to a crusted slope where the mud had hardened into cracked plates , where he could fit his fingers into crevices and drag himself ashore . It was scarcely a relief when he heard , " We 're safe . " In the gray distance behind them , that immense puffing came again and again , then settled down as if sobbing itself to sleep . He tried to imagine what could make such a sound : so soft and yet far-reaching ; so full of disappointment and dismay . Now he and the little brown man were exactly the same shade of muddy . The stuff was cold and sticky , as well as foul-flavored , obliterating whatever pleasure the sweet-scented air might have brought him . His host , muttering something about making themselves presentable , pulled Hugh to his feet and dragged him on , casting worried glances back at the density of darkness behind them . He thought he heard something sigh , and gather itself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes in the suction of the river . Now they trod a carpet of brittle grass that crunched and crumbled underfoot ; he walked on splinters of broken crystal , but they did no damage , seeming to dissolve as his full weight came down upon them . Each step produced a range of icy tinkling notes . " So this is your home , " he said , " but who are you ? " " I told you before , we are Mbe'lmbe . The last of our kind , and I am our king , although such titles mean nothing in our slavery , for they mean nothing to him . " " Him ? Who is he ? " " The Successor . The Factor . Our Master . Now , in here , quickly . " His host , the King , opened a door into a place that was slightly less gray and dim than the grim bank they had surmounted . Hugh stepped onto cold concrete and a shiver went through him . One yellow bulb burned blearily , far away down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ooze and the salts of the earth , crusted and nitred and yet somehow still smelling sweetly . A corroded fan spun overhead , creaking in the sugary breeze . That sweetness poured from a vent near the corridor ceiling , and the vent was caked with dusty white grit like that which formed on the battery terminals of an old car . The King tried closing the door behind them , but it was warped and Hugh could see that it was rarely used . Leaning against it with all his weight , the little King managed to slide the latch home , and left the crooked door straining against a darkness that seemed alive enough to ooze around its edges . The King scurried down the passage , his bare feet slapping the stained cement . Tiles of white and black , chipped and broken , sometimes missing entirely , gave the sense of grander days - an immaculate past , when such things must have mattered to someone . They passed another vent , spilling forth such a richness that Hugh was caught short by it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wondrous vapors . " What ... what is that smell ? " he asked . " Where is it coming from ? " " From the only part of this place that still functions as it should , " replied the King . " The Factor 's reactor . " They had left the lone bulb far behind when another door , much smaller than the other , appeared on one side of the hall . The King opened it for Hugh and waved him through with some ceremony . For a moment , it was dark , and then a light sprang on . This room was strangely prosaic , so ordinary that it struck him as completely out of place . There was a bed pushed into one corner , a small bureau , and a porcelain sink with dripping taps . A few books sat piled on the bureau , all covered in dust , with gilded titles in Latin and French , some bound in leather , still others in yellowed horn . Above that was a mirror in which he saw himself , completely covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King pulled open the topmost drawer , and inside Hugh saw a plain white shirt , a pair of short pants , a rolled up pair of socks . A flattened cap sat neatly atop this pile . The King toed around beneath the bed and pulled out a pair of shoes that seemed as if they probably would fit . " Whose room is this ? Whose clothes ? " " All were his , at one time , but he has forgotten this place exists . Those clothes should fit you , since you are now his age when he came here . I will leave you alone to groom yourself , and then we must make haste . " The King bowed and withdrew , leaving Hugh alone with the distinct impression that he had better not take a single moment to wonder what was happening to him . He stripped out of his pajamas and ran water from both taps until they ran clear after twin bursts of rust . The soap was an antique yellow sliver , but he used it sparingly , and it almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he felt he was really clean . He sponged himself with a washcloth that hung from a rack by the sink , then dried with a towel hanging from a peg . A black plastic comb sat on the rim of the sink , and as he lifted it , he became transfixed by the sight of one golden hair tangled in its broken black teeth . He set it down , feeling that to run it through his hair would have been like brushing his teeth with a stranger 's toothbrush . The clothes smelled of cinnamon and cloves , and were surprisingly soft , although ragged . As the King predicted , they all fit , though the pants were large in the waist . He used a coil of soft cotton rope , discovered in a drawer , to belt them . A jacket hung on the back of the door . Last of all , he settled the cap on his head to hide his bedraggled curls , and found that fit him too . Curious about the room 's former occupant , he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , dictionaries , and medical tomes . The horn-bound books were written by hand , as if copied out by monks , yet appeared to be cookbooks of some sort . Flames and loaves of bread were represented there ; minutely observed drawings of exotic herbs and berries . Other of the books proved to be journals . One of these sat by itself in the middle of the desk . He picked it up and opened it to a page marked with a slip of gold foil . The penmanship was neat and disciplined , yet something about it told him it was a child 's handwriting . - so much responsibility , thrust on me so fast , and I 'm unsure I am worthy of it , tho He thinks I am , I mainly worry how I can continue once He 's gone , as He says He soon must be . He says I have much promise and will have many Helpers and will surely discover my own talent though it seems all hidden now . He says the hands and wisdom of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem right . Why should anyone have to do whatever I " Little Master , we must be off ! " The door stood open . The King waited expectantly . In the interim , he also had cleaned and groomed himself . Hugh , without a second thought , closed the small journal and slipped it into a pocket of his jacket , feeling as if it belonged there , as if the pocket were stretched in exactly that shape from constant carrying . He was beginning to feel very odd indeed . The King of the Mbe'lmbe nudged him sideways out of the passage . He tried looking back the way they had come , to the far-off door by the muddy river , but it was all black down there now , and he could n't tell if lights had gone off or if the tunnel had simply filled up with darkness . A new light winked like a baleful subterrene Polaris from far off in the yet untraveled dark . It beckoned him . The complicated smells of rust and nitre had begun to exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even stranger than - the syrupy fumes that were so much a part of the atmosphere . They proceeded through what had been a sculpted arch , once no doubt quite ornate , now a sad affair of whitewashed beams and broken plaster that had mostly crumbled away . Dragging his fingers along the wall , he caught a few flecks of the stuff , and brought it reflexively to his mouth and then his tongue . Sweet . It was sweet as sugar yet stale as old pastry , like a sacrificial wafer from a mummy 's tomb . And thinking mummy thoughts , he was wholly unsurprised when a boat emerged from the cavernous gloom , and he found himself at the shore of a rancid Styx . There was no oarsman , no one to take the helm of the high-prowed ship , and in fact they were not to board the weathered craft . It lay canted against a splintered wharf , tied to stanchions striped like faded barber poles , and so thickly furred with lint and dust that he believed they must be ancient candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once , but no more , " the King murmured with mixed regret and relief . " The very essence of efficiency , it took its toll . " They hurried past the ruined ship and down the dark sweet throat from which the candyshop scents issued , the stagnant river lapping at their side . It was hard to imagine what stirred the river now . There was no wind , no current , yet thick little waves tracked them for a time , as if the boat were rocking to the motion of its hidden cargo , or as if something immense had lowered itself into the scum and begun to swim . Not far along , the little King caught sudden hold of Hugh 's wrist . Hugh wondered why this should be until he saw , in mounds of darkened earth , glittering white crosses running parallel to the river 's course , row upon row like sharks " teeth layered back into the darkness . Some of the little graves were set with delicate candy skulls , and the crosses themselves must be sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness ... the graves so small and close-set that at first he thought they must all be the graves of children , until he felt the King 's trembling and realized these were all his people . Not a single marker bore a name . He counted a hundred paces along the river 's edge , with a grave for every pace ; and that was only in the nearest row . He forced himself to stop counting , but the graves went on unnumbered . They grew more irregular , spaced farther apart , as if the things they held were increasingly large . The earth looked split and dried , like a cake that had baked too long , the doughy interior swelling up from beneath . The King had closed his eyes and clung to Hugh , his brow damp , his lips moving in feverish prayer . Finally they were past that dreadful place , and Hugh thought he might ask a simple question , but the King 's eyes sprang open and stopped him from even considering it . " Do not concern yourself with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden alone - I , who brought them here . You are here for the sake of the living . " " But .... " The question he had been burning to ask . " Why me ? " " Why ? It is the only way open to us now . Once there was another way , but in his madness he forsook it . Crazed and companionless , he has forgotten all goodness . He has forgotten life . Sugarbirds once sang here , but they have fallen silent . He has been too long without others . I did not show you all the graves . " Hugh swallowed , assuming he should be grateful for this mercy . The King 's eyes were terrible . " Now here , " he said , " say nothing . Do not show pity or contempt or anything untoward . Especially not fear ! Keep your thoughts shut up close . There must be no commotion . " They had arrived at another unexpected door , the appliqu letters pale and peeling . Once they had read SWETESHOPPE , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched the knob and opened it into a smell such as Hugh had never imagined . It was sweetness mingled with sweat , smells of toil and grief , vanilla and excrement , odors of violet and urine , butchershop blood and confectioner 's sugar . He caught himself at the threshold , unwilling to take a single step inside , until the King tugged at his wrist and he knew he must come . He started to put a hand to his mouth , but the King sensed his intent and slapped his hand down . He went forward smiling and bowing and beckoning at Hugh to stay beside him . All about them towered piles of glazed cooking pots , spiraling copper coils , gauges with needles trembling , steam spouting from high pipes , cages . Everywhere cages . He could not quite see what was in them , apart from the eyes , but that was enough . Eyes like boiled sweets , rolling and watching them , disembodied orbs with bright candy centers that shook and rattled and stared as they passed . That was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rank and humid , the sugary sweetness more cloying and more fetid . There were things in the cages , short and dark , that might have been people once , though now they were little more than enormous mouths with tubes going into them , and rich thick liquors bubbling through the tubes , and even greater richness straining the dark skins to bursting . In some places they had stretched until they split , and raspberry liquors oozed out between the cracks . " Show respect , " the King whispered , bowing and turning to all sides as they advanced . " But were they , are they , people ? " Hugh whispered in return , although to'do so meant he must inhale uncontrollably . " No ... not quite ... never . Not these . Not alive , exactly . Without constant irrigation , they would expire immediately . But He ... He has not the strength to end their misery . He starts but never finishes . The creator who can not also understand the need for death should never have been given such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . " " If they are n't alive , then how can they suffer ? " " Look at them . Look into their eyes and see if you can still ask such a question . " But he could not . He could n't even be certain where to find their eyes without straining close into the dimness of the cage , which was not something he felt strong enough to do . " Please , " he said , " I do n't like it here . " " I 'm not sure which are more to be pitied , " said the King . " These , or the ones that have achieved a kind of existence ... the ones that have managed to escape . " Hugh recalled the sound of the soft puffing mouth , the stirring of the stagnant river . He began to retch . " Now , now . We are almost through . " At the far end of the room , a door showed through a jumble of nut husks and toppled cages , - the floor was deeply grooved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the King released him to haul on the door , Hugh looked back and saw the caged things watching him , desperately sad , as if waiting to be eaten , wanting it , fearing it , knowing it was never to be . " Steel yourself , " said the King . But as the door flew open in a warm waft of wind , it was hard to know how this could be worse than what he 'd just seen - how it could be anything bad at all . The buttery smell of chocolate was so intense it obliterated all other odors . Instead of dimness , there was light ; instead of cloying humidity , the warmth of a friendly kitchen ; instead of screams and despondent sighs , the cheer of sputtering pots and hissing kettles . Blended scents of cinnamon , dark cherry and sweet cream , orange essence and pistachio , rosewater , lime and sugar on the edge of burning but not quite . All these and more wondrous odors came cutting through the chocolate , mixed with it , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the world above it must be morning now - breakfast time . Thinking perhaps the light and warmth had been decanted down through pipes and mirrored shafts from the world above , he squinted up toward the source of that golden radiance , but it was too brilliant to behold directly . He saw the mouth of an immense oven , a furnace that burned his eyes , forging vision into something simultaneously bright and dark . " Look away , " the King urged him . " It will blind you ! Look down low and you will see him . " Afterimages of the furnace sizzling on his eyes , he scanned the wide expanse of the chamber , searching till he saw movement far out on a distant plain . A man , tall and thin , almost skeletal . Hugh saw a top hat , a long black coat with tattered tails , a face white as chalk with a sharp white beard and sunken eyes . The face saw him and reeled him in ... he felt himself drawn across the spotted , stained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full height . The white face with its stiff goatee gazed severely at him with eyes mismatched , one crazed and cracked like a faded gumball , the other blue as a robin 's egg , bright and quite alert . It whipped swiftly down and sideways to aim a silent reproach at the King , then up it lashed toward Hugh . " Huh-hullo , " he said . Stained bluish lips peeled back from teeth so impossibly foul and decayed that Hugh 's jaws began to ache with sympathetic pain . They were broken stumps , ground down to nothing , splintered and eroded . Those that were not entirely gray were yellowed like antique ivory . It was an overly generous grin , most of it gum , and the gums even worse than the teeth because they were so clearly in distress . " And you are ? " said the reedy voice from that terrible , reeking mouth . Hugh would have staggered back , but the King of the Mbe'lmbe put a shoulder hard to the back of his thigh and pushed him forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hugh 's hand and thrust it up as if for that gumball eye 's consideration . " He is your successor , " stated the King . " I need none . " " Master , your time has ended . All who know you know this for the truth . Pass on the work that was passed to you . " " What I have learned can not be passed along . I need no apprentice , and I have no heir . " " But this is he ! There is none worthier ! None so pure ! None so sweet ! " " Sweet , you say ? " The gumball eye , looking as if it had been worn by repeated sucking , spun toward him . " You ... boy ... you do look familiar . " " As well he should . " " Still , he means nothing to me . Why do you say I should know him , eh ? " The top-hatted figure of the old Master thrust forward to catch at Hugh 's collar and cuffs , muttering all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " The fingers , he noticed , were sticky with honey and butter and chocolate . The white beard was stained with chocolate ; bright red dabs of jam gleamed at the corners of the awful mouth . Louder now , the muttering , and closer in his ear : " Life is sugar and sugar is life . " The fingers roamed his body , feeling his ribs . " You need fattening up . You need sweets . Nice sweets . You need this . " Hugh blinked . Beneath his nose , a bar of chocolate appeared as if from the thin man 's sleeves . He started to take it , but the King hauled down his arm by the elbow , with a whispered , " No ! " The thin man laughed down at the little King . " What do you fear ? That he will eat and never want to leave ? " " You know that is not what I fear ! " The white face leaned closer to Hugh again , bent down like a jack-inthe-box on a wobbling spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chocolate so close , beneath his nose , smelled delectable . Only the King 's fear held him back . There was something here he did not understand . He clamped his jaws shut and shook his head . " Well , then ... save it for later .... " The long white fingers drifted toward his pocket , pulling it open ever so slightly , dropping the chocolate bar in , patting the pocket to make sure it was safely ensconced . And then , " What 's this ? " The hand retracted , sticky fingers pinching the bound journal he 'd carried with him all this way . " What ... where did you find this ? " The brown King looked mystified , as baffled as the old white man . The old gent opened the book to the page with its golden marker , and his lips began to move . Hugh thought he was reading the journal entry there , but in fact his eyes were not upon the page . He plucked out the golden bookmark and his eyes grew watery and distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flicked his eyes over several lines . His lips trembled . He looked up at Hugh , then gazed with growing rage at the King of the Mbe'lmbe . His rotten teeth gnashed ; flecks of spittle sprayed from his foaming mouth . He tore the top hat from his head and hurled it down upon the floor . " Why show me this ? " he began to scream . " Why cast me back upon that shore ? " " I ... I ... it was a mistake , " the King began . " Please , Master .... " " After all I have done for you ? Wretched imp ! Is this how you show gratitude ? Sacre sucre ! I have come too far to be tripped up here ! " " Master ! Master , you are forgetting what you put in place ! Let me help you remember ! " Hugh found his arm gripped ever more firmly by the King . " Remember , Master ? Remember ? " Looking down , he caught the glimmer of a knife in the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it come from , and why ? He struggled to move away - so sharp ! But the Mbe'lmbe held him tight . " Do not be afraid , " said the little King soothingly . He found himself unable to resist . He wanted to trust the King . He saw his small white hand held almost tenderly in that much smaller brown one . He clenched his hand into a fist , but the King deftly uncurled his pinky finger and held it so it stuck straight out . With a sharp swift slice , he lopped off Hugh 's fingertip . Hugh bit his lip . He did not cry out , both because he feared to show fear before the hungry gumball eye , and because he felt no pain . The King of the Mbe'lmbe stepped forward with Hugh 's fingertip extended . Hugh looked at that and not his hand . He saw a round pink stub with a soft moonshell of fingernail , still quivering , still unaware it was no longer part of him . The old Master took the offering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from all sides , uncertain . He gave the little King a most curious questioning look , to which the King responded with a firm nod . The old man licked his lips with a dry gray tongue , then popped Hugh 's fingertip into his mouth . Hugh gasped as if feeling the old man 's rotten teeth in his flesh . The old Master shut his eyes . He bit down once , and Hugh heard a brittle crunching . He bit down twice , and Hugh heard the juices squirting . The Master 's eyes opened , rapt and delirious , delighted , a broad smile spreading over his face , transforming it in an instant into the face of a very old and wizened child . " My God ! " he crowed . He rolled his eyes . " I tried to tell you , Master , " said the King . The old man rushed toward Hugh and caught him up beneath his arms - caught him and threw him high into the air . He felt the furnace breathing over him , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that taste , that wonderful taste ... it comes back to me ! Oh , sweet victory ! Oh , ecstatic sweetness , sacre sucre ! The taste of sunlight to the leaf ! My boy , my dear boy , what a terrible misunderstanding ! Oh happy day ! Oh joy to you , joy to us all ! " He set Hugh down , and patted him tenderly on the head . " But ... do you not see , my boy ? " He fluttered the golden bookmark , and on it Hugh saw scratches of writing , thin letters incised in the foil and glinting . The lines were short and broken , like lines of poetry , like something else . Like ... like .... " The recipe ! " " For what ? " Hugh asked . " When I first drew you from the oven , ah , so small .... " He held his fingers to show a mere pinch of boy . " So pink ! Yes , yes ! Dusted in pink sugar , my marzipan boy ... so warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Why , I could have eaten you whole ! " The old confectioner 's eyes gaped , bulged , oozed sugary tears , staring at something beyond . " Come with me , my boy . Come now ... this way ... while the mood is upon me , while change is in the air , quickly now , quickly ! " Hugh realized , as the old man 's hands led him firmly along , that the glazed eye was fixed on the enormous oven . Above them burned an orange sun of flame , bright enough to have lit this and a hundred other underworlds ; but that was the top of the chimney . At floor level , coming closer , was the door of the oven . " This way ! This way ! Right along here ! Your heritage , my boy ... your birthright , and your birthing place . Exactly as intended , yes , I remember it now . Exactly ! You were to take this burden from me when I was too weary to carry it . You were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught from my books , fed from my fingers .... And look what time it is ! We must be quick , lad , quick ! " They paused at the gate of the immense furnace . Thick glass barely held back the volcanic fires within . Intense heat caused the oven door to bulge and blister toward them . The old confectioner reached out to twist a silver knob , and just like that the flames died down to nothing , and went out . " Here , lad , have no fear ! It 's completely cool ! Put your hand upon it ! " Hugh put out his hand and touched the glass . The furnace roar was less than a whisper , and the heat had died down completely . The flame still burned somewhere in the heights , but down here it was cool . " You will learn such secrets now , the mysteries of the oven will be yours ... come up , come up ! " The oven door drew up like the portcullis of a castle . He reached unbelieving into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racks that seemed to continue for miles back into darkness , the mouth of a spotless cave .... And suddenly the hand in his back pushed firmly . He lost his balance , tipped and plunged . The King of the Mbe'lmbe shrieked and reached out for him , but they were both lost in that instant . Hugh fell hard on the spotless floor . As he felt the King 's hands on his arms , trying to pull him back , he heard the whirr of oiled hinges and the deafening boom of the oven door sealing shut . He rose and turned . The King lay weeping on the ground , crumpled by failure and betrayal . Hugh could see the old confectioner , a shadow beyond the tinted glass , something made of smoke . The old man raised his hand to the silver knob by the side of the oven door . Then the glass began to fill with light . It felt to Hugh as if the sun were rising at his back . He scarcely minded . It was a pleasant warmth , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might melt away with a smile upon his face . But it was otherwise for the King of the Mbe'lmbe . Hugh only slowly realized what he was hearing , and what it meant . The little man was screaming . He turned and hammered his fist on the glass , making a rhythmic pounding to which the twisted figure beyond the glass seemed to dance an antic jig . He was certain he saw the top hat tossed high into the air and caught again . The old man was dancing out there . " Please ! " he cried . " Please help ! Please , somebody , help him ! " His hands left sticky bubbles on the tempered glass . He could hear the sizzling of flesh behind him , then came a burning smell unlike any that oven had ever known or should have known . Flesh .... Beyond the glowing pane , something greater moved . A spot of darkness swiftly expanded and swelled , glistening , gleaming , becoming immense . Against it , the small shape of the old confectioner stiffened , grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated until he was pressed against the glass of the oven door , separated only by that thin hot sheet from Hugh 's clawing fingertips . The old man turned to the glass , his face directly opposite Hugh 's , but all unseeing , blind with fear . Then the old face went awash in blackness , smothered in it . A gluey brown wave drenched the glass , washing over it like a thick and sticky tide that eventually , reluctantly , subsided . In drawing back , it flailed decisively at the silver knob , and the flames abruptly died . The oven door hissed and opened slightly . Hugh stumbled forward , then stopped and turned back to find the King limping toward him , his hair singed and smoking , his skin a mass of developing blisters . Together they stared across the sticky waste . The floor was like the shore of a sea of molasses at low tide . A crumpled top hat floated in the middle of the flood . There was no other sign of the old confectioner . The doorway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The King croaked in an urgent hush : " My farewell to you , young master . The sugarbirds again will sing in the rafters , but I will not linger here to hear them . I will not allow myself to come to hate you as I grew to hate him . I have sung my death song already . I go to lay myself among my people . " The sadness of the King 's words overwhelmed him and Hugh began to weep . Great sugary tears rolled down his cheeks and he flicked them aside with his tongue , trying to take no pleasure in so doing . The King of the Mbe'lmbe , last of his kind , clasped his hand with finality , then turned and walked over the Sweteshoppe threshold . Within , a great darkness gleamed as if welcoming the King . Then the door shut and Hugh was alone . Absently , he put his severed finger in his mouth and began to suck . And sucking , tasted sugary sweetness , raspberry jam , a touch of caramel , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The taste of sunlight to a leaf . If a mere man , with all his indigestible impurities , had whipped up such sweet life as he from scratch , then what might he , a boy of sugar , dream of making ? What radiant creatures of unsullied sweetness might issue from that titanic oven and soar out to dust the world with powder from their wings ? With visions overwhelming him almost to bursting , he realized he was nibbling the very slightest bit from his finger . He forced himself to stop , although it was difficult . No more ! He must find other sources of nourishment . He must make himself last as long as possible . It would be a struggle , a constant temptation . After all , he was so incredibly sweet .
