<p> The emaciated treeing walker coonhound had burns all over his body , including his paw pads , when he was found April 18 on Griffin Road in Ware County , where wildfires were raging out of control . <p> But today he 's feeling much better , thanks to the Okefenokee Humane Society , a small , nonprofit animal shelter in Waycross . <p> The hound is one of more than a hundred displaced pets that have flooded into the shelter since the fires in South Georgia started April 16 . <p> " We usually have 50 to 75 animals in the shelter , but one day we had 179 , " shelter director Kaye Thompson said this month . <p> She said some people who could n't take their pets with them dropped animals off when they were forced from their homes by the fires . Other pets have been turned loose to fend for themselves . Some were simply left behind . <p> " We took nine dogs off one farm because the woman did n't have any way to get them out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later and picked them all up . " <p> Thompson said a number of animals have been treated for fire-related injuries . <p> Others have been so covered with soot and ash that workers could n't tell what color they were until they bathed them . <p> To help the overwhelmed shelter , a local rescuer loaned it some large pens . And residents have donated everything from food and toys to bowls and leashes . <p> On May 2 , the GVMA Foundation , an arm of the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association , donated $2,500 to the shelter to help with the increased expenses , and five local Waycross veterinary clinics joined to match the donation . <p> " We wanted to be able to do something to help , " said Dr. Mike Younker , president of GVMA . " They 're always struggling for funds at humane societies . " <p> Dr. Rusty Gibson , the Waycross veterinarian who presented Thompson with both checks , said they 've been impressed with how the small shelter has stepped up to help as the fires burned through more than 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing everything they can to try and help the animals out there , " he said . <p> Gibson said the Waycross vet clinics also were offering discounted boarding to people who could n't take their pets when evacuated . He said they had n't seen many animals injured by the fires but warned people to keep animals out of the heavy smoke . <p> " If animals ca n't get out of the smoke , you could have long-term respiratory problems , " Gibson said . " They need to be inside , in filtered air , like people . " <p> He said most larger animals , like horses , have been trucked out of the area , so it was mainly smaller animals left behind . <p> Of course , wild animals had to make their own way . <p> Greg Nelms , a wildlife biologist with the state Department of Natural Resources in Waycross , said most animals flee a fire and will simply return once it 's out . He said people should not feed them . <p> " Most animals are adapted to recurrent fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their life cycle . " <p> Thompson said while she worried about the wildlife in the area , she has her hands full with the dogs , cats and even birds arriving daily at the shelter . <p> She said the shelter will use the donated money to buy pens and food , as well as gas for its trucks to search for more abandoned or injured pets . <p> She said the shelter will try to keep the pets as long as possible to give owners a chance to reclaim them , but she 's sure many of them will never go home . <p> " I figure in the next couple of weeks we 'll figure out how many displaced ones there are , then we can get those up for adoption , " she said . <p> But first , she said , they 're looking for someone to help post the photos on their Web site . One of those going up is likely to be the skinny hound , who is healing nicely from his burns .
