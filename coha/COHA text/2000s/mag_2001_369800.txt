PRODUCT The have-it-both-ways undie : a seamless back but with a supportive Lycra front to suck in excess tummy <P> HOW IT STARTED Under today 's clingy garments , flimsy underwear does n't cut it . Women need some support <P> JUDGMENT CALL Likely to become a lingerie-drawer staple <P> Ever wonder what kind of underwear lies beneath those revealing dresses worn by Toni Braxton and seemingly every other Hollywood siren these days ? On Grammy night , the members of Destiny 's Child were n't wearing a thing underneath their tight Versace gowns , their publicist says . But for every other woman who has tried to pour herself into one of those unforgiving bias-cut dresses , the inspired undergarment of the moment is the control thong . It 's a pair of panties that eliminates the lumps and bumps of underwear lines . You can wear it with clingy dresses or sheer pants and still tighten your tummy  --  maybe even zap an inch or two . <P> One early enthusiast was designer Donna Karan , who was looking for something to wear under her famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but supportive thong ( $22 at Bloomingdale 's ) , and others come from Nancy Ganz , Maidenform and Victoria 's Secret . Made of lightweight microfibers , the thongs are a far cry from your grandma 's breath-stopping girdle . And though some women still find the thongs a little risque , they 're getting used to them . Some 37 million thongs were sold in the U.S. in 1999 , giving the business a 20% boost in revenues over those of 1998 , according to the marketing information group NPD . Karyn Monget , lingerie editor at Women 's Wear Daily , predicts that come sandal season , as more women opt for bare legs , the control thong will take over right where control pantyhose left off . <P>  --  By Charla Krupp
