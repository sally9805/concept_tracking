We suggest that you do not purchase a camcorder with less than three CCDs if you plan to compete , and be sure it can be programmed manually as well as operating in automatic mode . There are many excellent brands available . Go to a good camera or electronic store where there is a knowledgeable salesperson that can demonstrate the features of the camcorder and will let you try it out . After you take it home , read the manual first ! Digital camcorders have many features , but to use them properly without becoming frustrated , you need to practice and follow the directions in the manual for best results . <p> Come to the PSA Conference in September and learn from the experts .
