It was not as hard to steal the collie pup as he thought it would be . From early morning when the woman set up and wiped her table with a cloth until the time the silver container of coffee was emptied by those coming to look at the dogs , there had been somebody around the camper and around the crate that held the pups . But lunch hour put the scatter in people . Tacos and fry bread were for sale on the other side of the bleachers-he could smell them . And the heat slowed things down , even for the dogs that panted hard and fast like they knew they were destined for the sheep-herding finals . <p> The high sun was what seemed to drive the woman into the camper . It was nothing more than company , the chance to talk out of the hearing of adults , that got rid of the girl and her sister . They went off with kids they seemed to know from the sheepraising universe of Colorado . There was discussion of buying Cokes or lemonades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a pup to hold . He 'd refused , staying polite and not looking too interested . He had a dog at home , he said , one that was good over pheasant and jumping in the water for ducks . A hunting dog from Texas . This was a lie from his mouth , though he 'd heard the exact same words said by a long-haul friend of his father 's . <p> Except for the dog stories , he had not liked that friend . <p> The girl had smooth brown hair held off her neck in braids the way 4-H girls he knew wore their hair , especially the ones who barrel-raced on horses . He was a little sorry she would get in trouble because of him . She 'd take the blame , no matter what . That was how it worked . But there was a pile of pups in that crate . At $400 apiece , nobody 's feelings or whipped ass was going to hurt for long . <p> Luck would determine if it was male or female . He would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . This , too , came from his father 's friend . But there was some number of male dogs in the finals . He 'd watched them stalk the skittery bands of sheep in the preliminaries . He knew how capable they were . And he did n't care what it was . The one the girl held away from her chest to show him had looked good enough to him . Everybody knew border collies were smart beyond the ordinary for dogs . You could train them to within an inch of their business , and they would wait outside a building for you with no rope or leash . They would wait for you all day . <p> He partly zipped his jacket and snapped the snap on its waistband . His Broncos hat was already so low on his head he could barely see . He slipped in and unpinned the crate before he even squatted down . The lucky one was towards the front , round-bellied , asleep on its side . He used two hands for support so as not to shock the pup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get-go . He lifted it like it was a glass tray . Then he got one hand under its sleepy , dangled haunches and slid it into his jacket . It did n't make a peep , nor did its many sisters and brothers . He closed the crate , put a quick touch on the bill of his Broncos hat to be sure it was set square on his head , and he was gone . <p> He waited until he was clear of the Meeker fairgrounds to take off his zippered jacket and turn it inside out so that the brown cloth fabric showed instead of the blue . He also removed his hat and tucked it in his back pocket , though his bare head felt showoffy to him . This was his disguise . He had to set the pup on the ground to make his changes . It was more alert now , and he saw its tongue bend in an arch when it yawned , and he saw its tiny teeth . The teeth were see-through and small like fish teeth . He scooped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female . He could tell that much . He could also tell from the mask of her face that she had the good , preferred markings he 'd heard the handlers talk about . <p> She made a sound in her white-furred throat , and he made a sound back . <p> He carried her through town inside his brown jacket , cars and trucks passing on both sides of the road . He supported her round belly with his hands , walking as if his hands were only in his jacket pockets and he was only going for a stroll . He used sidewalks when he could . He wished he could stop at the caf he saw-one with yellow-painted windowpanes around the windows-but he knew he could not , even though he had money , because of the deputies and what had happened with his father . He read the sign for the caf that hung out over the street , and he liked the sound of the name . Belle 's . He could call the pup that , call her Bell after the instrument and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Border collies always came with short names . It cut down on confusion . <p> Bell . A good name for a dog that was bound to be sweet but never shy . <p> He walked until he got to the gas stations . There was one on each side of the road just before the road filled out into a highway . He saw what he hoped to see on a good-weather Sunday , a steady stream of livestock trailers and open-backed trucks , many of them too large and awkward to pull next to the pumps . He 'd planned to take time to buy food , but he knew better than to pass on what looked like a rare chance . A red trailer stacked with hay was goose-necked to a diesel pickup with Colorado plates . The driver had left the rig angled near the air hose . He did what he 'd done before , apologizing to Bell in a low voice for the delay of their supper . He unlatched the trailer 's gate on one side and stepped into the dark crowdedness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jacket and set her safe in the trailer 's corner . He turned , made a loop of the orange rope that was already tied to the rear of the trailer , caught the latch handle in that loop , snugged the gate closed , and dropped the latch to lock them inside . It would be a hell of a sight easier to travel with hay than with steers or horses . They might not even get caught . <p> He sat down and drew Bell onto his lap , leaning into the sweet wall of hay . Bell had slept in the nest of his jacket , but she was awake now . Her dazedness was wearing off . He could feel the difference in the set of her legs and the sharp probing of her teeth on the soft parts of his hands . She would miss her brothers and sisters soon . He knew how that would go . Missing a sister-he did not have a brother-was a burn that was slow to cool . What he needed most was for Bell not to bark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town . He tried to keep her busy chewing on the bottoms of his jeans and on his hands , though her sharp fish teeth were already making him sore . He was glad when the driver cranked the rig and they eased onto the highway . The weather was dialed in . There would be no problems with heat or cold . They could find food later , though he understood food was something he knew how to do without while Bell did not . But if he was right , the trailer 's destination was close-no more than a couple of hours . He pulled his Broncos hat from his pocket and smoothed it down over his hair . He knew how to wait . <p> When the rig slowed to leave the highway , he took a look and thought the town might be Hayden . The driver pulled into another gas station but did n't cut the engine-it seemed like the driver only needed to take a leak . He bundled up Bell and got out of the trailer while the going was good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the air was beginning to smell of evening . He walked behind the station and took a leak of his own , then he let Bell walk and sniff some in the gravel . He needed to get one of those whistles , the kind only a dog could hear . For now , he 'd count on his voice and the way Bell would learn to listen to it . <p> " Come on , Bell . Come on , little gal . " He knelt on the gravel and called until she came to him . He told her she was pretty smart to make him proud on her first day . <p> He apologized for what he had to do next . He set her in an empty barrel that was soured from garbage , and he walked fast around the station and went inside and bought a pint of milk and some sticks of peppered jerky and two bottles of the fancy water his father made fun of . He paid for his selections with the bills folded in his front pants pocket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to leave her . He got back , and he stroked her on top while she drank water from a hamburger container until they both were calm . There was hay mixed in her black fur and a flat mark of grease on her tail . He tried to clean her with his fingers . He had some water , too , while Bell lapped at milk , then he got after the jerky . Bell did n't care for the jerky . He told himself that next time he would get the kind without pepper . <p> He had passed through Hayden before , and he liked his chances of finding a ride . He knew people paid no attention to strangers and how they came and went , alone or not alone , in the summer . He only wondered how bold he should be . His question was answered by the arrival of a club-cab Ford bearing two cowboys . He was standing near the phone booth when it pulled in . <p> He watched the driver for a short time . The driver was a rodeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of the Ford , and there was a show hat on the driver 's head . The passenger was dressed cowboy , too , though that meant nothing except a passenger was cause to travel faster . He walked up to the driver and asked for a ride . <p> " It 's just me and this little dog , " he said . <p> The driver , who was young and red-skinned from the day 's sun , looked him over . " Where to ? " <p> " I got cousins on the Front Range , cousins and a aunt . Any place toward Denver is good . The dog is for them . " <p> " Denver it is , " said the driver . <p> " Tell him he 's got to buy beer . " This came from the passenger . <p> " I do n't believe he 's old enough to buy beer . " <p> " Shit . You know what I mean . " <p> " I got money , " he said . And he dug into his pocket with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the young driver . <p> " Cute dog . " <p> " She is , " he said . " Smart , too . " <p> " What if she messes in the truck ? " This from the passenger again , in a mood . <p> " I 'll hold her . If she wets , she 'll wet on me . " <p> " I got a towel , " the driver said . " I do n't know what Ray 's worried about . A little dog like that ca n't out-mess him no how . " <p> " Fuck you , " said the passenger , making one piece of a smile . " And give over that money . I 've got a thirst . " <p> They got going pretty fast , him and Bell squeezed in the back of the cab with some rigging and a bull rider 's vest . He held Bell so she could look out the window as they drove , and she seemed to like that . The driver and Ray cracked beers and drank them and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass through Steamboat Springs because they wanted to make fun of the town for its traffic lights and tourists . The driver said he did n't know a single good horseman who could still afford to live in Steamboat . <p> " They got girls , though , " said Ray . He was watching out the windows just like Bell . <p> " Not the kind you like , " said the driver . <p> " What 's that mean ? " <p> " It means rich . It means talking and spoiling and taking your time . " <p> " And I ca n't do that ? " <p> " Besides your being butt-ugly , I 've never seen you slow down for nothing , even a rich girl . " <p> " Fuck you . " <p> " It 's true , " the driver said , laughing . " We have plowed this field before- " <p> " I ai n't plowed nothing with you . You can't- " <p> " My point is you could act right , but you do n't . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I did n't say one way or the other . " <p> Ray looked over his shoulder . " You say you 're giving up that dog . I would n't give up a good dog or a good gun , neither one . With those situations you know what 's next . They stay in bed all damn night whether you want them or not . " <p> " You got to excuse Ray , " the driver said , laughing some more . " He just got throwed off the crippledest mare on the West Slope . " <p> " Did n't do so hot yourself , twig dick . " <p> " I did n't . It 's lucky I got a credit card for gas . " <p> They went into their third beers as the truck hauled up Rabbit Ears Pass . He stashed their empties at his feet . Bell whined some at the change in altitude until Ray asked if he could hold her . He did n't want to give her up , but he knew travel meant all range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she seemed to take to him , working at his skin and his sleeves with her tongue and teeth . Ray gave him a cold beer in return , and he drank it , grateful . <p> He would guess later that it was the losing Ray could n't get past because he could n't find anything else about the situation that might have flipped the switch . Ray had n't had that much beer , none of them had . It was just that he had to make somebody else the loser . <p> " This is a nice dog , " Ray said after Bell curled into his lap for some sleep . " How old ? " <p> " Seven weeks , " he said . " She still misses her mama . " <p> " I do n't miss mine . How much she cost you ? " <p> He paused , listening for the trap . Older boys and men liked to set traps . " Four hundred , " he said . <p> Ray made a whistle sound behind his lips . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How much did those heelers go for in Rifle ? I saw Bobby Byrd take one , but I do n't recall the price . " <p> The driver turned his head for one second . " I do n't remember , had to be a couple hundred . You know , when you wake a pup- " <p> " Oh , damn . Shit . " <p> " That ai n't shit . " <p> " Damn . Make her stop . Come on , dog , stop . " <p> " Naw , " the driver said , choking . " Your britches ai n't wet with shit . " <p> Ray cussed a long streak , holding Bell in the air like a paper airplane while he tried to work the piss off his legs . The towel , they 'd all forgotten that . The driver , still aiming fast into the valley , reached under his seat and found an oil rag , which he tossed at Ray . " Oh , " said the driver . " Oh , I got one now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to tell on you now . " <p> " Goddamn dog , " Ray said . " Right on my best jeans . " <p> " I 'll take her , " he said from the back seat . " She did n't mean to hurt nothing . " <p> " The hell she did n't . She 's one bad thing after another on a bad day . So are you . Dillon there made you part of my damn bad day . " <p> " Then let us off , " he said , his heart bolting the way it did when he was close to trouble . " That 's what you can do . " <p> " That 's not what I want to do , " yelled Ray . <p> " Christ , Ray , it 's no more than pup piss . It 'll dry . " <p> " It is more . It 's what you said . " <p> " Christ , then . I take it back . I did n't mean to get under your saddle . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the money at Gunnison two weeks ago and you ai n't let up since . You do n't think I 'm good enough to haul with your gear . " <p> " Give the kid his dog . " <p> " No . " <p> " Give it to him . " <p> " I 'll give him something else first , " Ray said , his hand going after his belt buckle , and that meant two things to him in the back seat-it meant belt whipping or worse-and he 'd given up taking the hurt of both , so he reared between the seats and grabbed for little Bell . But Ray was quicker , and mean . He kept his hands free , and he got his window down , and he dropped the dog out onto the moving road . <p> " Christ . Jesus Christ , Ray . You ca n't do that , " yelled the driver . <p> But he had . <p> The driver , Dillon , hit the brakes , which sent them all flying forward , and cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of the truck , too . Ray kept yelling , his face the color of meat , but he heard nothing of it . He ran . He was all running . He saw her by the side of the road , black and white like a shoe tossed into the bristly cheatgrass . He saw her move . Then he was by her and with her , lying on the ground low and flat so she might see his face . Pleading . " Do n't be dead , Bell . Please do n't be dead . " <p> She staggered to her feet . She shook her head as though her ears itched , then bounded deeper into the bristled grass . She went away from him and away from the road . Scared . <p> " She rolled . Swear to God she rolled , I saw it in my mirror . She might be all right . " It was the driver , Dillon . He had backed his truck up to where they were . Ray was n't with him . " Young ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not 've felt it . " <p> He lifted her up , afraid to see blood in her mouth , afraid she 'd have eyes like his sister 's cats after they had been drop-kicked . <p> " I 'd take you to a vet , but I ca n't , not with Ray . I 'm sorry . The town 's right up here . Walden . I 'm sorry . Here 's money to have her looked at . " <p> There were sounds . The truck disappeared . He made out that it stopped for Ray before it started again , and he made out the pale leaf of a twenty-dollar bill on the darkness of the road . He picked up the bill and put it in a separate pocket . Bell 's heart was like a hammer against his hands , and his own heart was moving blood so fast it made his stomach sick . He was afraid the live part of Bell would tear through the skin of her chest and leave him behind , but it did n't . <p> After a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't let her down at first , but then he did . She walked like normal . She sniffed at the oily road . When she saw a grasshopper and tried to stalk it , he knew she was all right . Bent , but not broke . He told her he was glad . That he was proud of how tough she was and how she learned things . What she 'd learned was a lesson he had n't meant to teach her right away even though it was bound to come before you were ready for it , the black lesson of fear . <p> He let her play until his face was dry . <p> There were lights in some of the Walden houses , and the air was as cool as the river . The streets were quiet . He and Bell were n't likely to catch a ride now . He walked along the main street where the businesses were closed until he saw a pizza place . It was open , and there were kids inside , regular kids , paying $7.95 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spend his money that way . Maybe when they got to Denver he would . As a treat for himself even more than Bell . <p> He walked past the pizza place with Bell snug in his jacket . He turned left , smelling hot bread , then turned left again at the alley . The dumpster was near the kitchen , where he could hear people talking and banging things as they worked . After dark , he would check the dumpster . Leftover pizza was n't bad if you got it out of the box quick . <p> If a deputy or anybody asked , he was waiting for his father , who was fishing . There was a lot of fishing around Walden . He knew that even though he was from across the state line in Wyoming and had only been fishing with his father one time that he remembered . <p> His mother had never been part of anything . <p> He started walking again to avoid deputies and the kids moving through the spreading dark on their bikes . This was how he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a square with windows , and it was painted orange with trim that had some purple parts and some red . It was the kind of place that made people shake their heads . There was a white fence , too , no higher than his knees , and a small sign on the fence written in swirly letters . He put Bell down along the fence while he tried to read the letters . This was when she started to talk . <p> " Is that you , Donny ? Donald Bunch ? Is that you raising money for the band ? " <p> The woman was at the purple door of the house . She was holding on to the doorframe with both hands . <p> " No , ma'am . It 's not who you think . " <p> " Are you coming in ? We 're still open . " <p> " I do n't know . I just got here . I have my dog . " <p> " You should come in , " she said , turning . " I 'm not busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground , and he opened the gate in the low fence and went in . He wanted to be polite . The woman stopped him at the screen part of her door and said again how much he looked like Donny Bunch or any of the Bunch brothers . <p> " Do you know him from school ? He lives on Spur Ranch . Likes to ask me for money . " <p> " No , ma'am , I do n't know him . I 'm not from here . " <p> " Just as well , " she said . " New faces mean new facts . Come in so I can see you . " <p> He thought then that there was something wrong with her eyes and the way they seemed not to look right at him . He wondered if she was blind or partly blind . He was still wondering when he went into the house that smelled like a flower shop that kept both old flowers and new ones . The front room was crowded at the edges . There were square tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Do you have a name ? " <p> " I do . Tyler . Tyler ... Bell . " <p> " And your dog ? " <p> He realized his mistake and corrected for it . " She do n't have her right name yet , I just got her . " <p> " We might have to give her one , then . She 's very pretty , " the woman said , touching Bell between the ears like she knew what she was doing . Like she was n't all blind . " Will you have something to drink ? We 're open . " <p> He could tell there was no other person in the house to make up a " we . " He was n't sure what it would cost to drink something . He did n't see any lists . But he would pay if he had to . Ever since smelling that pizza , he 'd wanted to spend money . <p> " I ca n't stay long , " he said . " But a soda is okay if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ... and water for your friend ? I have that . I 'm sorry to hear you 're in a hurry . You did n't look it . " <p> He started to tell the story about waiting for his father , but something made him stop . He said nothing rather than saying a lie . His father hated places like the funny house . He would hate the woman and say terrible , rude things to her . But now ... now he was a great distance from his father . He had changed how the two of them were . Thinking of that made his hands go thick and hot . <p> The woman came back with water in a dish for Bell . Her return stirred up the smells again , the papery thin ones he did n't know . Bell was all over the floor of the house , playing , but it seemed to be working out . The woman said tea would be ready soon-he could have any kind he liked-and she apologized for the noise of a radio he could barely hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Sometimes I ca n't stop listening to it . " <p> He looked at her and her funny eyes when she said that . There was something in them , or not in them . " Do you have somebody over there ? " he asked . <p> " No , Tyler , I do n't . But thank you for asking . My boy fights what he fights down in Pueblo . I do n't see him much . " She made one hand into the shape of a cup . " I listen because I think I can learn what a damn thing is about . They 've got me fooled . I still think that . Maybe you 'll tell me I 'm wrong . " <p> " No , ma'am , " he said . " I would n't do that . " <p> " You 're shy , " she said . " But I can tell that does n't keep you from taking care of yourself . " <p> " The pup , " he said . " I 'm taking care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You 're very good with the dog . " <p> Then there was tea-he picked a mint one-and milk to put in it and lemony cookies and peanuts in a clay bowl . He ate more than he should have . He let her see he was hungry , but he planned to pay her so there would not be an obligation . He liked how she did everything calm and slow , though after a while it was hard for him to keep from yawning . <p> While he drank tea , the woman lit a match and put it to a straw she took from a bunch of straws . She stuck the straw in the pot of a green plant , and it gave off sweet smoke that he watched curl into the air . <p> " It 's called a joss stick , " the woman said , knowing he was watching it . <p> " Joss . It smells good , " he said . <p> " I had a cat named Joss , " she said . " A good cat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It might , " he said . " I could think about it . " <p> " How old are you ? " she asked . <p> " Fourteen , " he said . And that was the truth . <p> Night darkened the windows of the house until he saw the two of them in the separated panes of glass . She was smaller than he was , and careful moving with a thin cap of white hair , and seeing that made him ashamed that he 'd forgotten to remove his Broncos hat . He was double ashamed he had n't asked for her name . It felt too late to do it now . <p> He said , " I should take this pup and go on . " <p> " Oh , " she said , clearing his plate . " You 're getting ahead of me . You 're making a move , and I have n't even asked you to stay . " <p> The air around him closed in with all its smells , then opened again to his hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what to say . <p> She said , " I appreciate your not fooling with me . You have character . I know you 're on your own , I can see that much . It 's cold out , or it will be , and you need a place to sleep . " <p> He sat in the chair she 'd given to him , thinking . There was a bladed feeling in his stomach . He wanted to dull that blade and keep it sharp all at once . After a long minute he asked if she was a schoolteacher . <p> " I have been a teacher . I 've been a lot of things , some of them good , some just necessary . You do n't have to worry , I do n't ask many questions . " <p> " Just a few . " <p> " A few . Yes . " <p> Bell was wiggling to get down . He stood , planning to walk out . <p> " The dog , " the woman said . " She should n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to think of her . " <p> He cleaned himself at her sink and put on a sweatshirt she gave to him . The shirt was soft and faded . He wondered if it belonged to her son . There was a box for Bell with rags and paper . For him , there were blankets the woman brought from downstairs . It looked like she slept there , in the basement . She 'd said he could sleep on the floor next to Bell . <p> " It 's not like home , " she said . <p> He said , " It 's real nice . Thank you . " <p> " I call it home , " she said , seeming to chew around the word . " That 's my name for what it 's made of me . " <p> After the woman left , Bell lay down in her box , and he sat upright and watched her breathe for a long time . He liked how her body was loose . He liked how the day had n't left any marks on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he lay down to make himself loose . The house was warm , and it felt smaller than ever , like a tight , lidded box . He wondered if his breath , and Bell 's , and the sad , stretched breathing of the woman , could fill up the box in a single night . <p> They were at the door before he was awake . There was one at first , a deputy , and then another one . He was confused from sleep and from how quickly the woman walked around him and around Bell like she could see fine in the dark . She did n't say anything . It was n't even morning . Bell shook herself like dogs do . She started licking at her fur with her tongue while the inside of him took off running at full speed , his heart and his head-flying at full speed . The rest of him stayed put , stiff and silent next to Bell . It was too late . <p> The woman tried to talk to the deputies through her door , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thick jackets . He stayed on the floor with his legs held straight under the blankets so they could see he 'd quit . When one of them said his real name , he nodded . He knew they 'd seen copies of his picture . <p> " You come along with us , " the first deputy said . " We know you got a story . We do n't want trouble . " <p> He nodded again . Asked if he could put on his shoes . <p> " Not until we check , " the first one said . " Stand up and let us check . " <p> They stood him up and put on handcuffs and took the money from his pockets and took his hat , and while they touched him in those ways , his mind went to a high , cool place where it could stand hours of dark and hours of light and still hear the occasional hopeful words if they were spoken . He knew how to quit . And he knew how not to quit on everything . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really wanted it to work out with her . <p> The woman was talking faster than her usual talk . With more letters and sharp notes . <p> She said , " I did n't ask questions . But I know a thing or two , I figured you out . " <p> He stood there wearing her soft sweatshirt , not able to give it back . <p> She looked at him with padlocked eyes . " It 's the kind of person I am . What I 've turned into . I made a clear decision . " <p> He asked , " Will you take care of her ? " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " I wish you 'd thought of her . She likes it here . I guess I do n't think it 's right not to think of her , a little dog , when you make a decision . That 's how you said it with me . You said I had to consider . " He remembered how Ray had thrown Bell out of the truck and how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made a difference to her , that story . <p> She said , " You made your decision when you put your father in a pool of blood up there in Lyman . It might have been right to do that . I do n't know . Things get out of order in a family . Living gets us out of order . " <p> He climbed upward to his place , hand over hand . The woman went on , and the deputies went on , and they laid out their sentences like smooth , straight roads telling about his sister and who was caring for her and what his chances were . Bell left her box and came to his feet . She scratched at his jeans with her claws until the second deputy picked her up . <p> He said , " Cute dog . " <p> The woman said , " You let him ride with that dog , Walt Mason . You let him have her in the car for the drive to where you 're going . He wo n't see her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his high , quiet ears . She had been a schoolteacher , it was all through her voice . He was glad to know that . She had been a teacher in another time and another world that never included him , maybe a world that worked better than his did . She had taught things he had n't learned . Still , he knew little Bell would be good for the woman , he felt that , everybody in the tiny house had to feel that , and the woman did n't want the dog . He did n't understand . He would never understand , not with any carving of his heart he would n't . How could anybody not want the thing that would keep them from being sent backward one last time ? <p>
