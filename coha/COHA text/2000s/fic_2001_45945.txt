Just north of Truth or Consequences , he heard the unmistakable bang of metal punching through metal deep inside the engine . Lights came on all over the dash and then they were coasting along dead with Landis pumping at the brake pedal , which had lost its power-assist , and aiming them over onto the shoulder . <p> " What did you do ? " Bernice said , once they 'd come to a full stop . <p> " I did n't do anything . We threw a rod , I think . I told you there was a rattle . " <p> " So , this is my fault ? " <p> " I did n't say that . " He sighed . " It 's no one 's fault . " <p> Emily , who had been sleeping in a safety seat in the back , rubbed her eyes and sneezed . <p> " Oh , baby , " said Bernice . " You want a tissue ? " <p> Emily nodded . She had blond curls and big green eyes . She wore blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit Bernice had selected for her this morning at the Hardings ' after poking around to see where the child 's clothes were kept . <p> Bernice leaned back and wiped Emily 's nose dean , then balled the tissue and tossed it to the floor . " You 're thinking ' I told you so , ' are n't you ? " <p> " Not at all . " <p> " I know you are . Can it be fixed ? " <p> He turned the key . There was a clicking from the solenoid , but that was all . " With a new engine . " Landis stared out at Elephant Butte , which slept off to the side of the highway , a strange , layered form rising up off the flat desert landscape , and wondered if it were a sign . <p> " Then we 'd better see about getting a hotel room . " <p> The temperature was nearly one hundred degrees out , and with the A/C off the car was quickly turning into a convection oven . He turned to Bernice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyed hair standing up off her head like some comicbook artist had drawn it that way . He loved her . But she scared him a little , too . <p> He worried that a state trooper would come along , but it was a cowboy who stopped and asked if they were okay . Twenty minutes later , they were getting a tow into town . They stayed in the car , the three of them , tipped backwards into their seats like they were headed up a roller coaster ; at any moment , Landis expected his breath to be sucked away as they reached the top and went spilling over . Instead , the windshield remained full of bouncing blue sky . <p> The mechanic had gone home for the day , and the boy who 'd towed them took Landis 's forty dollars and wrote down his name on a grimy legal pad by the register . <p> " Where you staying at ? " he asked . <p> " What you got ? " Landis said . He could hear Bernice outside with Emily , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh , there 's a bunch of motels . Where you are , here , this is a resort town . " <p> " Last resort , do n't you mean ? " said Landis . <p> " Used to be people come here for the hot springs . " <p> " And now ? " <p> The boy adjusted his dirty cap . " Just to say they been . " " Sounds like my wife 's having a little trouble out there . " " I 'll bet she is . There ai n't no soda in that machine . " <p> Landis did n't find this surprising . The whole town seemed to him like it had been emptied of its contents . Or maybe more like a stage set  --  one of those fake towns you could visit for six bucks , where desperadoes shot it out with lawmen in the middle of the street every day at noon . <p> " Any of these cars for sale ? " <p> The attendant looked dubiously out toward the side of the lot where , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on blocks . " The Chevette , maybe . You 'd have to talk to Charlie . He 's the owner . " <p> Landis had four hundred dollars in cash , along with a maxed  --  out Discover card . He was n't sure about Bernice . He knew there was a roll of bills in her purse , but he had no idea how much it came to . <p> They checked into the Hot Springs Motel , two blocks down the street , then went to the Hilltop for dinner . When their orders arrived , Emily leaned her head forward and clasped her hands together . Bernice rolled her eyes and batted at the flies hovering over her chicken . " Thank you , Lord , " Emily said in a quiet voice , " for the bounty we are about to receive . " <p> " Bounty , " said Landis . " That 's one way of looking at it . " <p> " There used to be a candy bar called Bounty , " said Bernice . " I ca n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you like coconut ? " <p> Emily did n't answer . <p> " This town was named after a television show , " Landis said . <p> " I 'm not allowed to watch television , " said Emily . <p> " Yes , you are , " said Bernice . <p> " There 's a town in Montana that changed its name to Joe . " It occurred to Landis that trying to explain this further would be more trouble than it was worth . <p> " They should have called it Hollywood Squares , " Bernice said . <p> " Or Sonny and Cher . " <p> They turned their attention to the food . Emily had a bowl of macaroni with butter on it . She ate half , then drew quietly on her placemat with a Bic pen . Landis tried to get her interested in the mini-jukebox that hung over the table , but with no success . After coffee and pie and milk , the three of them walked through the still , hot air back to the motel . <p> The mirror over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left corner . The dresser itself was covered in cigarette burns . " Look , " said Bernice , " a dial phone . You do n't see that every day . " She turned the television on to the cartoon channel . Emily , clutching the stuffed turtle they 'd bought her at a rest stop outside of Albuquerque , climbed up on the bed to watch . Bernice stared hard at her . <p> " What ? " said Landis . " Something wrong ? " <p> Bernice turned to him and squinted . " You 're kidding , right ? " She went over and touched Emily 's face with the back of her hand and held it there . " She 's burning up . I knew she was hot , but I thought it was just the weather . I thought she 'd cool off once we got her into air-conditioning . Come on over here and feel her . " <p> Landis touched her forehead . " Aspirin ? " he suggested . <p> Bernice brought over a glass of water , but Emily would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , as if she 'd been slapped . <p> " Please , honey ? I think you have a touch of the flu . We have to put out the fire " <p> Emily shook her head . <p> " Hey , little girl , " said Landis , " listen up . Drink that water . " Bernice set the glass on the night table . " Never mind . Go on and watch the show . " She motioned to Landis to join her outside , and the two of them stepped out the door . <p> " We need another car , " he said . <p> " I know you think this is my fault , but it 's not . She lit a cigarette . " You drive too rough . " <p> He watched a bug bang itself against the floodlight attached to the side of the building . Getting into a big fight with Bernice was n't worth it just to prove a point . They had talked about using his truck , but she 'd insisted on her Hyundai , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing , but he 'd let her have her way . <p> Bernice sucked deeply on her cigarette , then tossed it . " I 'm going to go sit with her . It 's no fun being sick . " <p> The door clicked shut . He stared for a moment at a cloud that lay like a bruise against the purple sky . Bernice still had friends in Tucson . She and Emily were going to stay with them at first . Landis would either hitch or hop a bus back to Colorado Springs , take care of details  --  packing up her apartment and his trailer  --  then drive down in the truck in a few weeks . After that , they would start their new life together . <p> He 'd met her six months ago at Midnight , the club downtown where he was substitute soundman . Their first date was the movies , followed by cheap Mexican food , and not a lot of talking . This was okay with Landis  --  talking made him uneasy . It had been his experience that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to see another movie the following night  --  the latest Bond  --  and afterwards went back to his trailer with a bottle of Hornitos . There she told him how five years ago she 'd been at Boston University and gotten pregnant . She 'd answered an ad from a childless couple , come out here and lived in their basement for half a year . <p> " They prayed for me and the baby every night  --  I could hear them up in the living room , just kind of murmuring . Drove me nuts . After I gave birth , I got out as fast as I could , first to Tucson for a while , then to Florida where I had friends . Eventually , I came back , though . I still had a key , and I 'd head up there , park a block away , and sneak in . I 'd eat leftovers from the fridge , watch a little TV , look at the pictures of Emily . I knew where she was in daycare , and I got a job across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children playing in the yard from there . Emily liked to sit by herself , and she 'd stare at me as much as I was staring at her , so one day I just crossed the street , leaned over the stone wall and said hi . Know what ? She asked if I was her real mommy . " <p> " Busted , huh ? " said Landis . <p> " No kidding . I was pretty amazed . Then she said , ' Do n't worry . We pray for you . ' Like I needed to hear that . " <p> It was nearly four a.m. , and they both still had on all their clothes . This was not what Landis had envisioned , but he was coming to the conclusion that Bernice was n't much like other girls he 'd known . <p> " They are brainwashing her . It is n't right . They bought my child from me because they could n't have one of their own , and now they are killing her mind , one day at a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not mean for these people to have children . " <p> " What are you going to do about it ? " he asked . <p> " Take her back . " <p> " Excellent idea . " <p> Her eyes narrowed . " You do n't believe me ? " She lifted her arm to her mouth and bit into the fleshy part above her wrist . <p> " Hey " said Landis . " What are you doing ? " <p> She did n't answer , just looked out at him over her arm , which she continued to bite . After a few seconds , when blood appeared , she stopped . " Most people could n't do that to themselves , " she said . <p> " Most people would n't want to . " <p> " You 're looking at a woman with a purpose . " She grinned , the traces of red on her mouth like smeared lipstick . Then she took off her T-shirt and wrapped it around her arm . Landis tried not to appear to be staring at her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No way in hell , " he told her . <p> Emily 's room was Bernice 's old one , in the basement , so it had been easy enough slipping in and getting her this morning . Emily did n't seem surprised . She held on to Bernice 's hand like she 'd been doing it all her life . Seeing them that way had given Landis a surprisingly warm feeling . <p> Bernice was on the bed now , next to Emily , watching ScoobyDoo . " Remember Lucky Charms ? " she said . " Those marshmallow pieces made your teeth hurt . " <p> Landis saw that she 'd wrapped Emily in a blanket . " If she 's cold , we do n't need this . " He went over to the air conditioner and switched it off . It shuddered , did a miniature version of the noise the Hyundai had made , then fell silent . <p> " She was shivering , and her fever 's worse . I do n't like this at all . " <p> Emily poked at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do the minor prophets . " <p> " You go on and do them , " said Landis , sitting on the edge of the bed . <p> She closed her eyes and concentrated . " Amos , Obadiah , Jonah , Micah , Nahum ... " <p> " Kukla , Fran , and Ollie . " Bernice stood up . " I 'm getting you an aspirin . " <p> She went into the bathroom and fumbled through her bag . From where he was , Landis could see her reflection in the mirror , her smooth , strong arms tanned and pretty against the white of her T-shirt . She came back in with an aspirin that she had cut in half in her hand . " Please ? " <p> Emily swallowed the half-aspirin . <p> Landis got up and peered out the side of the blinds . He could see across the parking lot to the lobby , where a fluorescent light illuminated the " Vacancy " sign . There were two other cars in the lot , both of which had been there when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if they were always there . He tried to put himself in the Hardings ' position . They would have called the police pretty early this morning  --  Bernice said they got up around eight . The police would have asked who they thought might have taken the child . Would they think of Bernice ? It hardly mattered . Even if Landis and Bernice could somehow manage to return Emily without getting caught , the child could identify them . <p> " I can get us a Chevette , I 'm pretty sure , " Landis said . " Then , I think maybe we should turn around and take her straight back . Drop her off on the corner , give her a push in the right direction , and run . " <p> Bernice stood silently in the middle of the room , her hands in the back pockets of her jeans . Landis had the impression he was watching a sleepwalker waking up . " Do you think I 'm crazy ? " she asked . <p> " I do n't know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came over and leaned against the wall beside him . With the air-conditioning off , the room had quickly grown stuffy . The walls were permeated with old cigarette smell . " I need to hear from you that except for the engine blowing up on my car , and for Emily getting sick , this was an okay plan . " She pushed up against him and touched his arm with her hand . " Please ? Can you just say that ? " <p> There had to be other ways  --  he 'd tried to talk to her about them . The courts , for instance , regardless of the papers she 'd signed . But she would n't listen , claimed he did n't know what he was talking about , so he 'd backed off . " It was an okay plan , " he said . <p> She went into the bathroom and began running water into the tub . " Go on out and get some ice , " she said . " Get a whole big bag . " <p> He was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put Emily in the tub . He reached a hand in and quickly pulled it out . " That 's cold . " <p> " What do you think the ice is for ? We need to get her fever down . " <p> " That ca n't be right . Look at her . " He put the bag down in the sink . Emily 's naked body was magnified and flattened under the bluish lens of the bathwater , and she was clearly shivering . Her eyes were shut tight . Landis reached in and scooped her up in his arms . Water splashed all over the floor and all over him . She was so light . He grabbed a couple of towels off the rack and wrapped them around the child , brought her back out to her bed . Behind him , he heard the bathroom door click shut . First putting the T  --  shirt back on her , he tucked Emily in , leaving a towel under the back of her head where her hair was still wet . <p> Landis knocked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . " I 've ruined everything , " she said . " I 'm an unfit mother . " <p> " Shhh . Nothing 's done that ca n't be undone . " <p> " It is n't ? Do you know what you are saying ? Are you even in the same movie as me ? Because mine is a bad gangster one , and it ends in a hail of bullets . " <p> " Just stop it . Everything is under control . We 've got a little money . We 've got Emily . What we need is to get some sleep . " <p> They went quietly back into the bedroom . Emily 's face was still flushed , her closed eyelids fluttering like tiny moths . She was a strange one , he thought , like her mother . Any other kid would have been screaming in that ice water . Landis took the towel out from under her head and hung it on a chair . " She 's still hot , " he whispered . <p> Bernice took off her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He inventoried his body : his chest , hairy and beginning to gray ; his appendicitis scar ; another scar on his left thigh where a disturbed woman had stabbed him on a Greyhound ten years ago ; the flat feet he 'd inherited from his father , a construction worker . There 'd been a time in his life when he was impressed by his body , the fact that he had muscles , the long full head of hair that made him look like a rock star . Now , he was just glad nothing embarrassed him too much . In those days , he 'd never really felt he was looking at himself , but at something else . A work in progress . <p> He climbed into bed and slipped his arms around her . " Who was he ? " <p> " Who was who ? " <p> " The guy . Her daddy . You never said . " <p> " Just some kid I liked for a while . He was a baker . " <p> " A baker ? Really ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bake ? " <p> " Muffins . Bread . Cakes . I do n't know . " <p> " So what happened ? " <p> " I was a part-time cashier at the bakery . I saw the ad in the Phoenix , and I called . " <p> " You were n't pregnant ? " <p> " I got that way pretty quick . " <p> " The baker ? " <p> " Married his high school sweetheart . That was his plan all along . Let 's not talk anymore , okay ? " <p> " You never told him ? " <p> " Nope . It did n't involve him . " <p> " How can you say that ? " <p> " I 'd flunked out of school , my parents had cut me off . I had no money , no prospects . So I just did this thing . It was my business . " <p> There was a rustling from the next bed , and Emily got up and padded into the bathroom . When she came out , she did not return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Bernice . Landis turned on his side so that he was pressed up against Bernice 's back , and put his left arm over her , his fingers just brushing against Emily 's hot shoulder . As he lay there trying to gauge from their breathing whether either or both of them were asleep , the child took his hand and squeezed it , lightly at first , then harder . She was making sounds . He thought about what he had prayed for as a child  --  a dog , a ham radio , his parents to stop the yelling that went on night after night . That was the thing about kids  --  they believed if they just asked the right way , they could get the things they wanted , all of them . <p> In the morning , Emily 's shirt was soaked and clammy with sweat , but her fever was down . " It was the bath , " said Bernice , proudly . <p> Landis left them to clean up , walked back to the repair place , and struck a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred cash , for the Chevette . It was nearly twenty years old and on its second engine , and there was rust lacing the metal around the wheel wells , but it ran , the tires were decent , and the radio worked . <p> " Never thought I 'd have a Korean car , " the owner mused . He was a fat man of about fifty , with thick eyebrows . From the adjacent service bay came hammering sounds as the boy who 'd towed them yesterday attempted to remove a tire from a rim . " But I used to say that about the Japs , and look at them now . Did you know the bombs they dropped on Pearl Harbor were made out of steel we sold them ? " <p> " I guess what goes around comes around , " said Landis , fingering a collection box for cerebral palsy on the counter . " I 'll be back in a few minutes with my wife to sign over the title . " <p> " I 'll bet that car is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be surprised . " <p> " Swords into ploughshares , " said Landis . " Or sedans . " He thought about Emily . How long would it be before she asked to go home ? It surprised him that she had n't already , but there was something between her and Bernice , an understanding , that he would probably always be excluded from . He supposed he did n't mind that much . <p> " My point exactly . It 's nice to have an intelligent conversation like this from time to time . " The owner wiped sweat off his face with the back of his hand . It occurred to Landis that last thing he ought to be doing was making an impression on people . He found a penny in his pocket and stuck it in the box . <p> " Well , I 'll go get the plates off that one , " the man said . <p> Landis followed him out into the sun . A mangy yellow dog watched him from the shade beside a dumpster . As he headed back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget to move the car seat . <p> Author Affiliation
