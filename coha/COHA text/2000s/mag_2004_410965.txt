IT ALL SEEMS TOO REAL-THE CRASH , THE EMERGENCIES , THE INJURIES , BUT DO N'T WORRY , THIS COLD-WEATHER CONTEST IS JUST PART OF THE MARIN COUNCIL KLONDIKE DERBY .

Photograph These Scouts would n't stand a chance in the Marin Council 's Klondike Derby without their winter survival skills . // Marc Sinnott is on a trip to the Arctic on the S.S. Talako . But his ship has crashed into an iceberg , and he and the rest of the patrol from Troop 43 , Larkspur , Calif. , have been forced to board rafts and seek safety on the nearest block of ice . Now , Marc , 16 , and his fellow Scouts must survive on their own until a rescue team arrives . Welcome to the Marin Council Klondike Derby , also known as " S.O.S. " The test of survival is part of a game in which patrols compete against each other using a variety of Scouting skills . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined , the conditions were real . The event was held at Camp Marin-Sierra , located near the town of Emigrant Gap , Calif . In March 2003 , snowdrifts were several feet high and temperatures hovered just below freezing . " It requires teamwork and spirit and other skills you would use in a Scouting competition , " Marc says . " And the snow made it really cool . " ? The Klondike consisted of five scenarios , with a sled race at the end . There were 11 patrols of five to eight Scouts each . Every year , the Marin Council has a different theme for its Klondike derby . Andrew Wilson , a Life Scout with Troop 48 , Tiburon , Calif. , came up with the idea of the " S.O.S. " theme with fellow troop member Ryan Chan and local members of the Order of the Arrow . Talako is actually the name of the Order of the Arrow lodge ; Andrew is lodge chief .

The Storyline The first obstacle faced by Scouts is a test of winter first-aid skills . The story goes like this : After the shipwreck , a Scout is found washed up on an iceberg , suffering from hypothermia and injuries . Again , the symptoms are fake , but the skills needed to pass the test are real . Patrols receive points for using the appropriate skills in the least amount of time . In this case , Scouts have to get the victim warm and dry while applying medical attention to his injuries . The key to treating a victim of hypothermia is to shelter him from wind and cold . So they got him out of wet clothing and warmed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another scenario requires the Scouts to use their pioneering skills . A member of the patrol is in desperate need of a medical kit . Seems he has a condition that , without the proper medication , can kill him . The only problem is that the medical kit lies 10 feet out of reach on an iceberg ( really a 10-foot-wide icy cold stream ) . The patrol has 30 minutes to get the medical kit and save the Scout . " The only things they can use are poles and a lashing rope to build a device to retrieve the kit , " Andrew says . Troop 43 lashed together two long poles and tied another rope at the end to use as a guide rope . At the end of the poles , they used a wire hanger as a hook to scoop up the kit , just under the deadline . " It takes a lot of teamwork , " Marc says . " It 's neat to think about how we could actually apply those skills to real things . " The Plot Thickens One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food . Without proper nutrition , the thickest clothes in the world wo n't keep you warm . The lost patrol is running out of food . As luck would have it , the Scouts stumble across a can of food that survived the shipwreck . In order to complete this stage , patrols must successfully cook and eat the food in the least amount of time . Scouts are given two matches and a can opener , but the rest is up to them . If they need any extra matches , they lose valuable points . With kindling hard to find , patrols were allowed to bring in their own firewood . But getting a fire started in the middle of the snow is the real challenge-unless you 're with Troop 73 , Novato , Calif . That patrol breezed past the competition with a homemade device that , consisted of a string attached to an empty tuna can filled with wax . What they ended up with was an oversize candle that could be used to start the fire . It took only one match to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting their fire started , " says 12-year-old First Class Scout Kevin Wilmunder . " But it did n't take us long at all . " But now things are getting desperate for the " lost " patrols . If they do n't find help soon , they 'll be goners for sure . Then comes the big break . A search of the area turns up an emergency radio . The problem is that the Scout who found the radio had to leave it behind to get the rest of his teammates . He marked his path using articles of clothing . Now the Scouts must follow the trail of clothing and use their orienteering skills to find the radio in 30 minutes or less . " They are judged on their speed and their accuracy , " Andrew says . " If they do n't find all the checkpoints , they lose points . " Photograph Scouts must prepare a meal with one can of food , two matches and their own fire-starting kit . // The Final Chapter One last obstacle remains . A huge snowstorm has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled . This is a test of leadership skills , as one brave Scout must lead the rest of his patrol out of danger . Half of the group is blindfolded . The other half must simulate an injury by walking on just one leg . And they ca n't say a word . When it was all over , and all of the patrols had been rescued , the Scouts found time at the end for a sled race . Patrols had to bring their own homemade sleds . The first part of the race was an obstacle course that required teamwork to steer the sled through . The final stretch was sheer speed . " We were timed going both uphill and downhill , with some twists and turns in between , " Kevin says . " We got it going pretty fast at the end . " Throughout the two-day event , patrols were not only judged on time and the goals they achieved , but also on spirit . A troop yell before each event was a sure way to impress the judges . " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We got to cheer loud and show our enthusiasm . Our troop is pretty good at that . " A SURE FIRE STARTER Troop 78 started its fire with an empty can of tuna fish and some string . It just goes to show that starting a fire in the snow is often a matter of using your brain as much as your hands . Another way to start a fire that works every time requires only cotton , petroleum jelly and an empty 35-millimeter film canister . Grab enough cotton to form a shape about the size of a tennis ball . Squeeze it down by mixing it with a marble-size gfob of petroleum jelly . Pack the jelly-covered cotton tightly into the film canister . To use the item to start your fire , pull out a small amount of the fluff to give it room to breathe . One match should do the trick every time . For more information on winter Scouting skills , check out " Okpik : Cold-Weather Camping " ( BSA Supply Ko. 34040 ; 1-800-323-0732 ; vww.scoutstuff.org ) .

Above : In the final section of the derby , one brave leading Scout has to lead his " injured " crew ( below ) to safety . // ALL TIED UP A lashing is anything used for securing or binding . Centuries ago , people used lashing to create tools and weapons . At the Marin Council Klondike Derby , Scouts had to Lash two poles together to create a tool that could pick up an item ttlat was 10 feet away . This is called two-spar shear lashing . ( A spar is a wooden or metal pole . ) The two-spar shear lashing technique is ideal when the goal is to extend the length of one , piece of wood by attaching another to it . Start with a clove hitch knot an one piece of wood . Then make several wraps above the knot around both pieces of wood . To pull the wraps tight , make trapping turns to take up the slack , and then tie a clove hitch , knot on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For more information on rope , knots and lashing , check out the " Pioneering " merit badge pasnphiet ( BSA Supply No. 33377 ; 1-800-323-0732 ; www.scoutstuff.org ) . <p>
