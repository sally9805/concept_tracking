K. D. Wentworth says her current projects include a western fantasy for young readers and a pair of books she 's co-writing with Eric Flint . Her charming new story owes its origin to a neighbor 's escaped German Shorthaired Pointer , but we 're hopeful that the rest of the story is more fancy than fact . <p> FTER SHE TOOK EARLY retirement at fifty-two from her job at the university library , Ally Coelho 's life ran along like an old car , occasionally missing on one cylinder or the other , but in the end , usually getting her at least close to where she wanted to go . Of course there were disappointments , especially in the relationship department , but she made do with whatever came along until the universe started amusing itself by playing dice with her life . It had begun with a stray dog that bounded past the front yard when Ally was on her knees , weeding geraniums . The day was golden June , the temperature already climbing toward the nineties . Her auburn hair clung to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dog was a sleek German Shorthaired Pointer , lean as a racing hound and panting from the day 's heat . Ally lured it with a bowl of water and then examined its tag , which revealed its name was " Sadee . " She phoned the owner , who drove over in a silver van and collected it with many expressions of gratitude . That was how it had happened . But she also knew that the dog had merely glanced at her with freedom-crazed eyes , then careened off into the street where a Ford Tempo had knocked it into the gutter . That time she 'd checked for a tag and called the owner , too , who had arrived with two weeping boys , eleven and nine , to collect Sadee 's broken body in an old blanket for burial . Both scenes played in her mind like dueling movie trailers . She remembered the boys " beaming faces when they hugged their retrieved companion and their tears as their mother picked up the pointer 's carcass . It was n't one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could resolve the question of which memory was real by calling the family , who lived less than a mile away , and asking after the dog , but she feared the answer . As long as she did n't inquire , the pointer might very well be frisking in its backyard , digging holes and playing ball . If it was buried under a tree somewhere , she did not want to know . So she did n't even drive past the dog 's house , hoping to catch a glimpse . She just tried to put the whole matter out of her mind and worked on dividing her hostas for replanting . But then her young friend Melinda , a former coworker from the library , called to say she and Carl , her longtime beau , were finally getting married . They would have a huge ceremony at the Methodist church and then leave on a wedding trip to Scotland . There were rings to buy , invitations and music to be selected , the perfect dress to be found . It was all joyous and anticipatory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Ally got up the next morning , though , she also knew that Carl had been transferred to Rio and not asked Melinda to go with him . Instead , he had said it was too far to carry on a long-distance relationship . They had best agree just to be friends . Melinda was inconsolable and no longer answered the phone . Ally felt she must be going crazy . Both time lines ran in her mind , equally valid . Surely one of them had happened first , but when she tried to remember which , they danced through her memory , woven together and inseparable . Later that afternoon , when she was pruning her roses , she realized that Melinda had caught Carl with another woman at the local bingo casino and ended the relationship herself . Melinda had booked passage on a cruise to Alaska , alone . Carl had gone out drinking and wrecked his car . His arm was broken in two places . She would not think about it , Ally told herself firmly . It was just her imagination running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn and Ron , go out to dinner , and forget all this nonsense . They accepted and agreed to meet her at a favorite local Mexican restaurant , the one that resembled a festive village inside and featured a two-story waterfall . But she waited there at the hostess station alone on the green vinyl couch , as parties of diners came and went , for forty minutes until her cell phone rang . Where was she , Lynn wanted to know . They were at Caruso 's , a popular Italian buffet , and the hostess would n't seat them until Ally arrived . Aghast , Ally pleaded car trouble and apologized , then went straight home and shut herself into the dimness of her bedroom . Hungry , head whirling , she curled up in her favorite old green throw . The next morning , Saturday , she remembered that the three of them had eaten dinner at a P. F. Chang 's restaurant , how Ron , engaging as ever , had teased her about the threads of gray in her auburn hair , and Lynn had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monstrously large chocolate cake , split it among the three of them , and still could n't finish . Her life seemed to be going on without her , splintering off into a hundred different directions . Maybe she needed Prozac , she told herself . Or Valium . Maybe it was time to hibernate , or she should talk to a counselor . But no . She was just letting her mind wander . All she had to do was pay closer attention to what was going on around her and all this ... confusion ... would melt away . Just after lunch , Lynn dropped by to see Ally as she was trundling the lawn mower around to the backyard . Her friend parked her Ford SUV on the street and got out , long legs tan and tit . Her dark hair was caught up in a clip on the back of her head and she wore threadbare cutoffs . " Was n't that Barry a card last night ? " she said as she walked across the grass . " I do n't know when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought a friend - a single gentleman her age with them to Fuddrucker 's , Ally realized . He 'd had thinning silver hair and deep brown eyes half-buried in smile lines . He worked at the zoo with the hoofed animals , technically known as " ungulates , " specialized in zebras , and had been divorced for five years . She stared at Lynn , clutching the lawn mower 's battered handle , unable to speak . " He wants to go out with you . " Lynn waved a persistent fly out of her face . " It 's okay that I gave him your phone number , is n't it ? " " Sure , " Ally heard herself say , though her voice trembled . Sweat soaked the back of her old T-shirt . " He was quite - charming . " And he had been , she knew now . How could she have forgotten ? " Who knows ? " Lynn said with an affectionate smile . " This could be the start of something big . " BARRY CALLED that afternoon . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retro diner that served wonderful milk shakes , and then a movie . Ally had n't been out on a real date for more than a year now . Sweet old-fashioned anticipation washed through her , laced with a bit of fear . What if he had n't really called ? Any minute now , she might remember how much he 'd disliked her . But the day wore on and the date stayed firm . Maybe she 'd just dreamed all those other things . Maybe she 'd even go see the pointer 's family and assure herself that Sadee still romped in her own backyard . Everything would be all right . She dressed in a cool white summer skirt with her favorite aqua blouse and met Barry at the door . He was taller than she remembered and mostly bald . His lips were thinner , and he did n't look like he found much in life amusing . " Did you work at the zoo today ? " she asked as they walked to his car . The air was hot and sticky , and she fanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek chorus in the neighborhood trees . " I sell life insurance , " Barry said , giving her a sideways glance . " I thought Lynn told you that . " He opened the car door . It was a black Jaguar , low-slung , sleek , and somehow menacing . Ally slid in across the fine leather seat , heart thumping . They drove to Finelli 's , a shadowy Italian restaurant staffed by sneering waiters , to eat bruschetta and garlicky ravioli . He related mindnumbing tales of his best sales months , the reluctant clients he 'd coaxed aboard , and the thrill of exceeding his quotas , then drove her to a claustrophobic club to listen to progressive jazz . The discordant music washed over her , battering her nerves . Each chord seemed to reinforce all the strangeness of the last few days . She knotted her fingers . What had happened to the other Barry , the one with the shy smile ? That was who she was supposed to see at her door tonight , not this slick stranger with his intimidating expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , tantalizing her with the promise of one thing , then sending her quite another . All her Ufe , she had determinedly dealt with whatever came her way , but she did n't know how to cope when everything kept changing , second by second . He took her home at midnight , and they parted with only a chaste peck on the cheek . She was n't to his taste , she was quite certain , and she had definitely been expecting someone else when she 'd answered the door . Her sleep was filled with dreams of a silver-haired Barry who charmed her with tales of fractious zebras and red-spotted deer . They finished huge chocolate milk shakes , then left the diner , skipping the movie to walk the zoo after hours , where he pointed out the different ungulates in their paddocks by silvery moonlight . When she woke , though , that scenario stayed only a dream , the night with insurance salesman Barry a reality . She was disappointed . Though the chronic changes of the last few days had been disconcerting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been welcome . Insurance-Barry did n't call again , nor did she expect that he would . Most likely he 'd made the date with someone else , too , a different Ally , who was sure and sophisticated , twenty pounds slimmer , well versed in progressive jazz , and decked out in tottery high heels . Perhaps the universe had played a trick on him , too . If so , she was sorry for her part in the deception . Thereafter , Ufe calmed down for a few days , running only on a single track , almost boring . Lynn called to see how her date had gone , but was n't surprised . " He already has four ex-wives , " she said . " I was surprised you agreed to go out with such a jerk . Ron only asked him to sit down with us at dinner because it was obvious he would n't go away . " Of course , she had n't agreed to go out with that particular Barry , but she could n't explain that . At loose ends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across town to the zoo and walked its winding pathways for hours . The ungulate paddocks were just as she 'd dreamed them , though not nearly as glamorous by daylight . She hung on splintery wooden fences and studied water buffalo , camels , giraffes , and the exotic okapi with its striped legs . Large and small , they each moved with a grace that brought peace to her heart . " Lovely , are n't they ? " a voice said behind her shoulder . She looked around . " Barry ? " His silver hair gleamed in the late afternoon sun . His eyes were halfburied in smile lines . " Have you been here before ? " he asked . His name was stitched in red thread across the khaki shoulder of his keeper 's uniform . " No , " she said slowly , heart thumping , " but I 've thought about it . " She watched the stately giraffe amble across its paddock , ears waggling . " It 's a bit like my gardening , so many different varieties , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Exactly . " He leaned on the rail beside her and gazed at the giraffe as it stretched its elegant neck to nibble oak leaves . His face creased in thought . " Most people prefer the big cats , though , because they 're so dramatic , or the reptile house for sheer shock value . " " They have their own attractions , " she said , " but I 've been dreaming about these . " " I 'm pretty much finished with my duties for the day , " this Barry said . " Would you like a backstage tour of the facility ? " So they walked through the barns as he explained each species , what was special about it , what unique care it required . The smell of baking earth , hay , and feed filled the air , along with the redolence of dung . She watched his face more than listened to his words . He loved his work - in fact , in many ways , he was his work . The zoo closed at six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tired children drifted toward the parking lot . " This was lovely , " she said , stopping beside the pond that isolated Monkey Island . The green water rippled , and then a turtle head broke the surface to stare at them . " Thank you so much . " " We 're always looking for volunteers , " he said , " especially docents to handle tours . " " I would like that . " She fumbled in her purse for a stray scrap of paper , then wrote her name and number . " Please give my information to the proper authorities . " She drove home in a warm joyous haze . She had taken her fate into her own hands , and for once things had come out at least close to the way she wanted . The next morning , she knew that she had encountered only a mumbling man named Art working the ungulates section of the zoo . She 'd walked for hours and seen nothing of interest but animals half-stultified by the intense heat . Now all she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon with Barry had happened too . They both were true . When the phone finally did ring , it was like an electric current ran through her-but it was only Melinda , planning her Puerto Vallarta honeymoon , not Barry , or even the zoo , confirming her offer to volunteer . She met Lynn for lunch at a local sandwich outlet and ordered a steaming meatball sub . " That wretch Barry called Ron last night , " Lynn said as she slid into the booth . " He had the nerve to ask us if we had any friends with a bit more " go . ' " Insurance-Barry , Ally hoped , not Zoo-Barry . " Well , he 's certainly not my type , " she said . " Ron should do it , if he wants . " " So he can insult another friend of ours ? " " This is bald Barry , is n't it ? " Ally asked as the blood pounded in her ears . " Bald as a billiard ball , " Lynn said , " if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered a salad and now picked at a cherry tomato perched on top . They chatted through the rest of the meal , then Lynn looked at her watch . " Goodness ! " she said . " I have to drop by school to pick up Carina for her doctor 's appointment . " " Carina ? " Ally 's fingers gripped the plastic soda cup too tightly . It crunched in , portending collapse . " My daughter , " Lynn said with a wry smile as she picked up her purse . " Your goddaughter . That Carina . " Lynn and Ron had no children . But with a rush , Ally realized they had three : two boys who were excellent students , currently in third and fifth grade , and then Carina , sixteen , in high school , who was always getting into scrapes . She smiled as best she could , which was n't very well at the moment . If this went on , she thought , she 'd never have to worry about smile lines around her eyes . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept up her neck . " Give her my love . " THE ZOO NEVER called , nor did Zoo-Barry , though another zoo memory surfaced to take its place beside the others : a middle-aged zookeeper , a woman named Emma , who had stopped to chat as Ally watched the caribou . Emma had complained about the heat , her wages , her coworkers , and zoo patrons who fed the animals even though it was strictly forbidden . The woman had droned on and on into Ally 's ear until she fled the zoo well before closing time . Lynn 's daughter , Carina , came by to drop off some gardening magazines , and Ally wondered how she could ever have forgotten that angular young face , topped at the moment by a bristle of outrageously red hair . " Are you dating anyone special ? " she asked her goddaughter as she opened the front door . " God , no , Aunt Ally ! " Carina laughed . " This is n't Leave It to Beaver ! No one dates anymore ! That 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " Ally shared a Diet Coke with her , then watched the girl drive off on her orange motorized scooter . Lynn and Ron had been seriously committed to the Zero Population Growth movement . They 'd never wanted children , had in fact taken early steps to end their fertility . She knew that as well as she knew Carina 's face . Maybe if she did n't go anywhere or see anyone , things would calm down . All the alternate memories that kept bobbing like corks up into her consciousness involved people , so if she just stayed home , there would be nothing to drive her crazy . Zoo-Barry called that night with the schedule for upcoming docent training classes . She 'd meant to turn down all potential interactions for the time being , but found herself agreeing to attend . All the way across town to the zoo the next day , she kept telling herself he would n't be there , the Barry she wanted to see . It would be someone else , taller , skinnier , fatter , meaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only given she could depend upon these days . Every time she thought she had a handle on reality , it twisted out of her grasp like a snake , as though someone Up There were having a really good laugh at her expense . Of course , it was possible , she thought with a shudder as she turned into the vast zoo parking lot , that she might be slipping into early Alzheimer 's ; but if so , she wanted to keep it to herself as long as possible . Admissions checked off her name on a list , then sent her to an administration building . The day was already hot as she followed the sidewalks , dodging eager children towing balloons and detouring dropped Popsicles melting in the sun . Over on the east side of the zoo , one of the elephants trumpeted as though to welcome her . When she reached her destination , most of the other potential docents were at least her age , older genial people with time on their hands and an interest in nature . She sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding chair , and listened to the zoo director , a tall lean woman with an intense manner and braided graying hair , as she explained their educational " mission statement . " Barry was nowhere to be seen . Perhaps he was feeding the elk , she thought , or maybe whatever Barry was in existence today liked working with the tigers or the penguins instead , and had no time for the poor ungulates . The trainees split into small groups , each led by an experienced docent , and went out into the zoo to start learning the facility . Ally 's instructor was a seventyish man named Oliver who had volunteered here for eleven years . The gorillas were his passion . He knew everything about them , regarded them , in fact , as surrogate children and visited them evert on days when he was n't working . She found them unsettling , though , their gaze so humanlike and yet so alien , and was relieved when their group moved on to the Large Cat Pavilion . A sinuous black panther , sprawled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked into the air-conditioned coolness . Its golden eyes were heavy-lidded , its manner disdainful . A man in a khaki uniform and work boots was examining the exhibit , checking off items on a clipboard . He had more hair than Barry , was a bit shorter , a tad stouter around the middle . He turned around as Oliver was explaining the history of the two cats on display , and she felt her cheeks warm . " Barry ! " The man smiled uncertainly . " I 'm sorry . Have we met ? " This Barry had blue eyes rather than brown , but he was pretty much the same guy . " Back when you worked the Ungulates area , " she said , easing away from her docent group as Oliver droned on about feeding schedules and the success of the breeding program . " You were the one who inspired me to volunteer . " " Gosh . " Barry scratched his head . " That 's been a good two years now . You 'll have to forgive me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Coelho . Allison Coelho . My friends call me Ally . " She put out her hand and he automatically accepted it . His grip was warm and firm , and , this close , his uniform gave off the aroma of sun-warmed hay . Her head whirled and she had to make herself release his fingers . " Are you going to specialize in one particular area , " he said , glancing at the trainees , " or work as a general guide ? " " I 'm especially fond of the ungulates , " she said . " Really ? " He smiled and there were all those smile lines , nested at the corners of his eyes , just as before . " We do n't get too many volunteers requesting that area . Ungulates were my particular favorites until I got promoted . I still spend as much time with them as I can manage . " He fished in his pocket , came up with a battered black case , and removed a card . " Please feel free to call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She clasped the card in nervous fingers . " Th-thank you , " she managed as he tucked the clipboard under his arm and strode back out into the fierce June sunlight . On the other side of the glass , the panther leapt to its feet and snarled . Its eyes , she noticed , had gone green . Twice a week thereafter , Ally reported for decent training , but never saw Barry again . Once she asked about him at Admissions and was told no one named Barry worked on the staff . After that , she was afraid to ask , as though her conscious efforts forced him farther away in this vast river of possibilities that was carrying her along . Carina dropped by again , decked out in a nose ring and dog collar , and shyly admitted that she was hanging around quite a bit these days with a guy in her " posse " by the name of Jerret . " Not that we 've got a thing for each other , " her goddaughter said defiantly , waving a Twinkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just , like , see eye to eye , some of the time , and I 'm way better in math than he is . The poor slob can use all the help he can get . " Hang onto him , Ally wanted to say . If you 're not paying attention , the universe can sweep him away any second . But she just smiled and opened a second package of Twinkles , Carina 's current poison of choice . After two months , Ally qualified as a decent and began taking small tours out on her own , mostly groups of unruly children who thought the zoo had nothing to offer that they could n't see more often and better on television . Whenever she passed the ungulate paddocks , she always remembered that marvelous dream when she and Barry had walked the zoo by moonlight . Of all the things her wayward mind insisted upon remembering , this was the only one that had never really happened . Every time one of the male zoo staff passed , she checked his uniform , but indeed Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd become Insurance-Barry for good , or perhaps a plumber or car salesman . Even if she could have located one of them , those Barrys were not the one she wanted . Instead , she applied herself to what she did have , accepting extra tours when no one else was available , learning more and more about the animals , so that the job was its own reward . Carina had quit dropping by , and it seemed that Lynn and Ron had no children again . Lynn had looked at her strangely the last time she 'd asked after her goddaughter , so now she just waited for the subject to be brought up , and for the last month , it never had been . Ron and Lynn were planning a trip to Greece , in fact , which they never could have afforded if they had three children to put through college . Ally felt mired in this life where nothing was certain . Everyone she liked kept going away - Barry and Carina , and even that stupid dog she 'd rescued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . One Wednesday , she reported to the zoo and met her tour group in the late afternoon , a father and his four children . According to her slip , the three girls were three , six , and seven , the boy , fourteen . They waited for her at the pond around Monkey Island . The father , tall and silver-haired , turned to her . It was Barry , or a version of him anyway , more angular and careworn than she 'd last seen him , his face grooved with sadness . " Ms. Coelho ? " he said , and held out his hand . " I 'm Barry Frey and these are my children , Anna , Sylvie , Marty , and Brent . " She took his hand , trying not to stare . The first two Barrys she 'd met had been divorced . Had any of the others been married ? She 'd never known . She made herself smile . " Shall we start with the giraffes ? " They strolled through the sweltering August afternoon , seeking shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stately giraffes . They hung on the fence and pointed , though she could tell the boy was already restless . " They lost their mother at Christmas , " Barry confided as they left the giraffe paddock and headed toward the water buffalo . " I keep trying to find ways to distract them , but nothing really works . " " Maybe Brent would like to volunteer with the Zoo Teens program , " Ally said . " It 's quite popular with young people , and he might meet some new friends . " Carina , she realized , was doing such volunteer work , mostly in the Raptor House . The owls were her goddaughter 's favorites . She was even collecting grisly owl pellets made of mouse skeletons for her next year 's science project . After the tour , they dropped by the administration building and signed Brent up . His eyes looked alive for the first time that day as he read the brochure . Barry thanked her and then bundled his family into a dark green Honda . So many Barrys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own attractions and problems . Thereafter , the universe seemed to relent . She ran into Barry almost every day , or at least some version of him . One was a concrete contractor who had come to repair the seal pool . He had a stronger brow than ZooBarry and a badly healed broken nose . Another was a gap-toothed deliveryman trundling in cartons of frozen confections for the concession stand . There was White-Collar-Barry , complete with briefcase , auditing the zoo 's finances , and Advertising-Barry who was putting together a media campaign to increase zoo attendance . She met GrantBarry who was writing grant applications for the zoo and Mayor's-AideBarry who was scheduled to conduct a press conference on-site about zoo funding . So many Barrys made her head swim , too much of a good thing , and in truth , she still longed for Zoo-Barry , who had an openness most of the others lacked . Oftentimes , that dream walk in the moonlight seemed truer than anything that had actually happened . One evening in early September , just after she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it and found Barry , or at least a Barry , standing there . This one looked tan and genial , dressed in carefully pressed jeans and a blue-checked shirt . They had a date , she realized , a movie out at the old Admiral Twin , the only drive-in theater left in town . Her face was smudged , her clothes sweaty and damp from wrestling with a leaky hose . " I - " she said . Barry laughed and there were those smile Unes again . It was him , she thought with a swell of hope . " You forgot , did n't you ? " He stepped inside and swept her into a hug . " I love it that you get so earned away with your garden . It 's all right . We still have plenty of time for you to change your clothes . " They 'd been dating for three months , every Friday night like clockwork . The memories surfaced in her head as she darted back to the bedroom and peeled out of her dirty clothes to shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used juniper-scented soap , his favorite . They 'd been good months , too , and recently he 'd introduced her to his grown children , Brent and Marty . Things seemed to taking a more serious turn , their times together rich with promise . Tears bubbled up in her eyes . Tomorrow she 'd wake up and realize Barry was married to someone else . The two of them would have quarreled , or he 'd be dead . His children would hate her , or he would have a job in Siberia , so that they 'd never met at all . It was like being on the oldfashioned merry-go-round where you kept coming around to see the brass ring , then being whirled away again , empty-handed . She dressed in a beige skirt , sandals , and a lacy cotton blouse , and grabbed her purse . They headed out through the firefly-laced dusk to the movie ( something about treasure and blowing up trains - she never did get the title straight ) and snuggled like two kids the whole feature . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her back . " Barry ? " She put out a hand and traced a shoulder nestled against hers . " Mmmm ? " he said . They had made love for the first time last night , she remembered . It had been slow and sweet and Utterly wonderful . And the universe had let her keep it . Smiling , she got up and made him chocolate chip pancakes from scratch . He sat across from her at the kitchen table , talking about his plans to acquire a new zebra stallion from the San Jose Zoo . The current stud had gone a bit senile , it seemed , and preferred the company of his own sons to receptive mares . She watched him , entranced . Every moment seemed precious because tomorrow she would remember it a different way . " I have to work this afternoon , " Barry said , finally laying aside his fork . " George Spencer is off and I 'm filling in . " " I 'll go in , too , " she said hastily , afraid if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd turn back into Insurance-Barry or any one of his thousand other iterations . " Maybe they need some help somewhere . " Barry smiled and pulled her into his arms . He lowered his face and murmured into her hair , " They always do . " By the time they 'd gotten to the zoo , however , she remembered how they 'd agreed last night to " put the brakes on , " as he 'd termed it . His son , Brent , was getting married next month and wanted Barry to walk his ex-wife , Brenda , into the church and then sit at her side , in some ghoulish fantasy of " if things look all right , then they are . " Ally was n't invited to the wedding , because that would make Brenda unhappy . It was Brent 's big day , after all , Barry said . He was sure Ally understood . And Ally did understand , all right . The universe was having at heryet again . They emerged from his Jeep Wrangler in the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved at her wearily . " Okay , meet you back here at five ? " Somewhere , she knew , the universe was laughing . It had once again showed her what she most wanted in the whole world , then swept it away before she could even catch her breath . She spotted Carina , just beyond the Admissions booth , carrying a broom and walking with a group of Zoo Teens toward the penguin exhibit . Her sometime goddaughter had pink hair today and looked enthused as Ally had rarely seen her . This roller-coaster ride was at least doing her some good . Ally whirled on Barry , who was startled and stepped back . " No , " she said with a forcefulness entirely foreign to her orderly soul , " it is not okay with me ! " She glanced up at the sky . " Do you hear that ? " Seizing his face in her hands , she pulled him down to her for a desperately passionate kiss , the likes of which she could never remember planting on anyone before , Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood locked together in the middle of the parking lot until someone passing snickered . " Hey , gramps , get a room ! " Barry laughed and broke the kiss , though he still held her close . That night at the drive-in , she thought frantically , trying to hold on to this particular slice of reality , smile lines , silver hair , a warm and welcome presence in bed . He shimmered , as though she were seeing him through waves of heat . His hair thinned , receding even as she looked . Insurance-Barry , she thought grimly . " No ! " she shouted at the universe . " Not this time ! " She kissed him again , more insistently , until her brain had the consistency of warm custard . Her knees threatened to give way and she could think of nothing beyond this moment . " I - " Barry stopped , apparently unable to continue his thought . His mouth gaped as he stared down at her , now wearing the concrete company 's black uniform . They 'd been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable for nine . Her stepchildren hated her and had driven them apart . She 'd secretly consulted a divorce attorney just two days ago . Barry was a selfish , grasping , miserly She threw her arms around him again and held on , though she could feel his confusion . She wanted her one true Barry , no one else ! The parking lot wavered , and then an industrial park stood in place of the zoo , which had been shut down years ago by the city as an unpopular , unprofitable enterprise . Auto glass was now fabricated here and wooden pallets for shipping . There was no Barry , no Carina , no wonderful old drive-in where you could watch movies under the starlight . Her arms were empty . She was standing alone . Her hands dropped to her sides . Why did the pieces of her life keep shifting , falling into new configurations - some beautiful , others plain , or boring , or even outright depressing ? Had she committed some great unpardonable wrong for which she had to keep paying over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head had come unstuck . Maybe she was developing Alzheimer 's . " I want it back , " she said hoarsely to the sky in the busy parking lot as massive delivery trucks maneuvered past her . " I want him back ! " The universe , of course , paid no mind . BY THE NEXT morning , she had the zoo again and her volunteer job as a docent , but not Barry . They 'd never met , her rogue memory told her , as she poured coffee into a travel mug , though she had caught sight of him working in the giraffe paddock once . She moved through her day in a daze , speaking when required , being polite to her tour groups . Even her garden at home gave her no pleasure . The hostas seemed gray and unreal , the geraniums terribly ephemeral . Her little house , so snug and reassuring before , seemed likely to become a pizzeria when she was n't looking , or the lobby of a bank . Perhaps she would wander homeless then , begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for certain . Nothing lasted , and she could n't do anything about it . That evening , one of the Barrys called , but she just hung up before she figured out which of his many versions it was . Even if this was the right one , it hurt too much to spend time together just to have him snatched away mid-kiss . He called again , every night for a week , but she could not bear to exchange a single word with him . Finally , toward the end of September , her friend Melinda stopped by . When Ally opened the door , all of Melinda 's possible lives danced through her mind , equally real : Melinda 's wedding , abandonment , honeymoon , Carl 's betrayal " How-are you ? " Ally said unsteadily , having no way to tell which particular Melinda had come to see her . " I 've brought the honeymoon pictures , " Melinda said , sweeping past her into the living room . " But the real question is - how are you ? " She flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardening book to the floor , and gazed at Ally disapprovingly . " You 're breaking his heart , you know . " " " His heart ' ? " Ally closed the front door and followed her inside . " Barry 's , " Melinda said , as though Ally were a foolish little girl . " At least tell him what he 's done . " " He-has n't done anything , " Ally said . Despair seeped through her . " Of course not . " Melinda pulled a huge packet of pictures out of her purse . " This is Barry we 're talking about . He 's so perfect , he makes my teeth ache . " " It 's just - " Ally locked her hands together and stared at her tennis shoes , fighting tears . " No matter how hard I try , I ca n't have him . The universe - wo n't let me . " Melinda sorted through the pictures , her expression intent . " Why in heaven 's name not ? " " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it work out , but , for whatever reason , it just is n't going to happen . " The doorbell rang . Ally excused herself to answer it and found a bluehaired , pierced-nosed Carina waiting on her porch , to wing a pimply young man decked out all in black and three sets of earrings . " Aunt Ally , " she said with a crooked , shy smile . " I brought Jerret by , so you could meet him , like you asked . " " Wonderful , " Ally said , as her mind whirled . " Come - in . " She seated them in the living room , across from Melinda , and left the three of them examining the Puerto Vallarta honeymoon photos while she rummaged through the refrigerator in search of something to serve at this impromptu party . The doorbell rang again . Who now , she thought crossly , Lynn and Carl ? The next-door neighbors and their five children ? A twenty-piece brass band from the local high school ? All she 'd wanted tonight was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't the universe going to allow her at least that much ? She heard Carina answer the door , then toenails clicked across the parquet . A slim brown-spotted dog bounded around the corner into the kitchen and jumped joyously up to lick her . It was Sadee , the dog she both had - and had not - rescued . A dark-haired woman trailed behind , leash in one hand and something wriggling in her other arm . " Down , Sadee ! " she said breathlessly . " I 'm so sorry . We just wanted to drop by . " Ally dropped to her knee on the white tile kitchen floor and smoothed a hand over Sadee 's sleek head . She was gloriously alive . " Sadee had pups eight weeks ago , courtesy of her adventure that day when she escaped the yard , " the woman said . " Because you rescued her , my sons wanted you to have the pick of the litter . " She set a brown-furred puppy down on the floor and it promptly piddled . Sighing , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the thick coat , we think the father might have been an Akita , though it 's hard to tell just yet . I know you might not want a dog right now , but you were so kind to Sadee when she got loose , and I promised the boys I would ask . " The woman tore off towel sheets to soak up the puddle . " She 's not housebroken , yet , I 'm afraid . " " It 's all right , " Ally said , entranced . " No harm done . " She gathered the bright-eyed ball of fuzz up and cradled it to her . The puppy yapped , then licked her neck , so soft and warm . " It 's real , " she murmured to herself . " Very real , " the woman said wryly . " And I 've got seven more just like her , in case one 's not enough . " She heard the front door open again , though this time the bell had n't even rung . Were Carina and Jerret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the living room . Barry was standing in the doorway , talking with Melinda . " There you are , " he said , turning to her . Ally steeled herself for the disparate and unsuspected memories that were sure to surface . Which Barry was this ? The one she 'd married , with such unhappy results ? The one who sold insurance ? The one who fixed pools ? Would he stay for a minute , or an hour , or even a day before the universe snatched him away ? " It 's getting dark , " he said , " and there 's a full moon tonight . You always said you wanted to see the zoo by moonlight . " He held out his hand . Her dream . The puppy wriggled in her arms . " But you 'll just leave me , " she said to Barry - really , to the whole room , all of them , so transitory . " You always do . " " Hey , you 're the one who wo n't answer the damned phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all about . " " She just has trouble making up her mind , " Melinda said , thrusting the honeymoon pictures back inside her purse . " Always has , as long as I 've known her . " " Aunt Ally , you 're so funny , " Carina said reprovingly . " Do n't be rude to the poor schmuck . Are n't you the one who 's always telling me to " take a chance ' ? " She lifted the struggling puppy from Ally 's arms . It squirmed around and nipped her chin . She laughed . " Co with him . Jerret and I will dog-sit . " She did want to go , to make that dream image a reality , but how could she bear it when the universe snatched him away tomorrow ? " What is with you , woman ? " Barry threw his arms around her . " You keep getting away from me . One day , you have blue eyes , the next , hazel . Your hair is short , then down to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment over on the other side of town and take up playing the piano . You volunteer at the zoo , but the next week , they 've never heard of you . You say you love me , and then you wo n't even answer the phone . It 's like I 'm always on the trail of the real Ally , but she keeps hiding . " My god , she thought . Had it been happening to him , too ? She tilted her head and examined his brown eyes . It was him , the one she had been seeking now for months , like a rare and splendid color glimpsed at dawn never replicated throughout the rest of the day . " I 'm sorry , " she said . Her pulse pounded in her ears . " I promise that I have n't been running away . " " Then , come on , " he said and towed her out the door before she could even grab her purse . They used his keys and ED to get through the employees " entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard smiled and waved them past . Just as she had dreamed , moonlight made everything silver and mysterious : fences and the sleepy-eyed dun pony in the petting zoo , bams , even the stagnant old turtle pond . Bats flitted overhead , black against the deep blue night sky , and wind rustled through the treetops . The air was deliciously cool . She and Barry toured the drowsing water buffalo , the giraffes , the okapi , the zebras . He tucked her arm over his , so that their strides kept time with each other . With every moment , Barry seemed more solid , more really there with her . But it had been like that before , and in the end , she was always left at the mercy of all the other less desirable Barrys who crowded him out . " This is lovely , " she said as they paused at the elk paddock . The lead bull 's eyes glittered with reflected starlight . " But it wo n't last . It never does . I just do n't think the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next exhibit . " Forget the universe , " he said and turned her to face him in front of the mouse deer enclosure . The little animals had clustered into a wary pint-sized herd at the far end . " What do you want ? " " I want- " Sadee , the dog , dashed by again in her mind , equally ah " ve and dead . Carina and her wildly colored hair wavered in and out of existence . Melinda and Carl bought a new condo and simultaneously filed for divorce . She struggled to focus . " I want-only to see the beauty in the world , the good things , whatever will make us happiest . " " Then we 'll have to chart our course carefully , " he said . " Keep our eyes on the prize and all that . " He tucked a lock of her flyaway hair behind her ear . Then he faded , and balding Insurance-Barry stood before her . As always , the corners of his mouth turned down . She pushed them up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver hair with all her might . " I have a puppy , " she said desperately , " Sadee 's puppy , conceived on the day I found her . She did n't run in front of a car . She lived ! " That other terrible scenario , the one with the bloody carcass , faded until it was only a faint shadow , the echo of something tragic that might have happened , but , in the end , had not . The night rippled , then his silver hair again gleamed in the moonlight . He seemed astonishingly , heartbreakingly , real . " I 'm almost as good as a puppy , " he said helpfully , eyebrows quirked in that familiar appealing way . " Almost . " The breath caught in her chest . Her arms stole around his neck , and she leaned in so close , she felt his heart beating under her cheek . " And I 'm already housebroken , " he said into her hair . " Let 's not forget that . " The multitude of other possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd of insistent ghosts . I will not see you ! she told them . You all belong somewhere else ! Go away ! One by one , then , they faded like smoke on the wind . This Barry felt suddenly anchored , as though he were here to stay . Let those other Allys , who were undoubtedly all skinnier , younger , funnier , smarter , and more sophisticated , pursue their own versions of Barry , she thought . She tilted her head back and gazed up at the glittering , cut-glass stars , holding on with all her might . This one , universe , was hers .
