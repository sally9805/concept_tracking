<p> At soccer practice last month , Bri Clark went up for a header  --  something the 16-year-old LaGrange girl has done countless times before . <p> Except this time , Bri did n't hit the ball . She hit the back of her teammate 's head . <p> " Both of us fell down and were dizzy , " said Bri , who 's spent six years on the Windy City Pride soccer club . " She kept playing , but I went off the field . I was really dizzy and could n't concentrate . " <p> Bri had a concussion , a brain injury that results from a violent blow or shaking . Getting " dinged " can spark a slew of symptoms : headache , dizziness , confusion , loss of consciousness . It causes temporary  --  or potentially permanent  --  disturbances in brain function . <p> Research to be published next month in the Journal of Athletic Training suggests that unlike other sports-related injuries , concussions are on the rise among high school athletes . Girls appear to be especially vulnerable , logging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes . <p> Researchers at Ohio State and Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , analyzed injuries among U.S. high school athletes participating in nine sports : boys ' football , soccer , basketball , baseball and wrestling , and girls ' soccer , basketball , volleyball and softball . They estimate that in the 2005-06 academic year , high school athletes suffered 135,901 concussions  --  or 9 percent of all sports-related injuries . <p> Some of the upswing in concussions might be the result of today 's high school athletes being bigger , stronger and faster than their predecessors . Most concussions occur through player-to-player contact . Experts speculate another possibility is that coaches and athletes know more about the importance and symptoms of these brain bruises than they did a decade ago , meaning they 're more likely to report the injury . <p> The study found that girls were more prone to get their proverbial bell rung than boys were . Female soccer players had a 68 percent higher rate of concussion than their male counterparts . In basketball , girls were 200 percent more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a little surprised to see the higher rates among girls , " said the study 's senior author , Dawn Comstock , who thinks a couple of factors might explain the discrepancy . In general , boys have stronger neck muscles , which act as a shock absorber so the head does n't get jarred as severely . <p> " And there may be some socio-cultural aspects going on , " Comstock said . " Unless the person is knocked unconscious , we often have to rely on the athlete to tell us what 's wrong . Traditionally , boys have been taught to suck it up for the team and fight through the pain . They may not be as willing as girls to report the symptoms of concussion . " <p> Playing through the pain is the worst thing you can do when it comes to concussion , said Dr. Preston Wolin , who specializes in sports medicine at the Neurologic and Orthopedic Institute of Chicago . Wolin has seen plenty of these brain injuries as team doctor for local high school , college and professional athletic organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wolin said . " If an athlete tries to go back and play too soon , they 're at increased risk of another concussion . And the chance that the second concussion will be more severe is greatly increased . " <p> If athletes hit their head and appear " out of it , " there 's a good chance they have a concussion , Wolin said . They should stop playing and get checked out by someone knowledgeable about concussions , which do n't necessarily appear on MRI or CT scans . They should be reintroduced to the sport gradually , once it 's clear all symptoms have subsided . <p> A new way to tell if athletes are ready to return is by gauging their performance on a neurocognitive screening tool called ImPACT . Athletes take the computerized test before they 're injured so they have a baseline score as a comparison in case they get hurt later in the season . Doctors at Rush University Medical Center are using the computer software , and the Chicago Institute for Neurosurgery and Neuroresearch last week announced it 's giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Rita . <p> As long as there are contact sports , there will be concussions . But athletes can take steps to reduce their risk . To safely head a soccer ball , for example , players should keep their head and neck still  --  locked together as one unit  --  while moving their body toward the ball . In football , the sport that caused the most concussions , certain helmets , such as Riddell 's Revolution , have been shown to decrease the incidence of concussion . Some studies have indicated that the Full 90 Headguard offers similar protection to soccer players , but Wolin is skeptical . <p> " I do n't think there 's any convincing scientific evidence it works , " he said . <p> After suffering two concussions playing soccer , Bri Clark recently decided to start wearing the Full 90 . <p> " It helps make me feel protected , " said Bri , a sophomore at west suburban Nazareth Academy . Despite the risk of another injury , she has no intention of giving up the sport she loves . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We have an epidemic of obesity in the U.S. , and physical activity is key to combat against that , " Comstock said . " We definitely do n't want to scare parents away from letting their kids play sports . " <p> HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AND CONCUSSIONS <p> During a single game or practice in the 2005-06 school year , here 's how many concussions occurred for every 100,000 high school athletes in the following nine sports : <p> Sport Concussions <p> Football ( boys ) 47 <p> Soccer ( girls ) 36 <p> Soccer ( boys ) 22 <p> Basketball ( girls ) 21 <p> Wrestling ( boys ) 18 <p> Basketball ( boys ) 7 <p> Softball ( girls ) 7 <p> Baseball ( boys ) 5 <p> Volleyball ( girls ) 5 <p> Source : 2005-2006 High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study and the Journal of Athletic Training , <p> December 2007 <p> ACTS OF KINDNESS <p> PROCEDURE COULD BE A LIFESAVER <p> Sergio Jimenez , 26 , had been suffering severe headaches , blurry vision and dizziness . <p> His condition became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bolivia , where Jimenez lives with his wife and baby . <p> Physicians diagnosed Jimenez with AVM , or arterio-venous malformation . A snarled cluster of blood vessels was lodged in his brain , causing an array of symptoms and putting him at risk for fatal bleeding . <p> Jimenez could have had brain surgery to remove the AVM . But the Bolivian doctors recommended that he consider a non-invasive procedure called Gamma Knife , which treats the problematic area with targeted radiation while sparing healthy surrounding tissue . <p> There was one problem , though . Gamma Knife technology is n't available in the South American country . <p> But it is available at the Illinois Gamma Knife Center , part of the Neurosciences Institute at Alexian Brothers in Elk Grove Village . And Jimenez 's aunt , Maria Jimenez-Fitzgerald of Schaumburg , happens to be a nurse in the Alexian Brothers Health System . <p> " I could n't believe it when I went on the Internet and found that Alexian does the Gamma Knife . I thought we would need to go to Mayo Clinic , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of 18 . " Even when you work at the hospital , you do n't know everything they have . " <p> She immediately asked hospital officials if her nephew could come to Alexian for the Gamma Knife procedure . She figured she could pay it off through deductions in her paycheck . <p> Alexian Brothers agreed to treat Jimenez , but they rejected his aunt 's request for docked pay . Instead , they agreed to do the whole procedure for free . <p> Last month , Jimenez had his Gamma Knife treatment . It 's too soon to tell if Jimenez 's health problems are over for good , but he already feels better . He plans to return to Bolivia in December and start looking for a new job as an industrial engineer . <p> SHOUT OUT <p> BEST OF THE HEALTH BLOGS
