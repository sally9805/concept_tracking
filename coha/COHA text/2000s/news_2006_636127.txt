<p> In the wee hours of the morning , public streets are blocked off , crowds gather , and bets are placed . Two cars line up , side by side , engines roaring . <p> From start to finish , they will race just a quarter mile but at speeds close to 150 mph . One winner . One loser . <p> In the last three months , from Elgin to Gary , Ind. , at least seven people have been killed in what police describe as drag racing incidents . <p> It is an underground sport , and , according to Chicago Police and those involved , street races are happening across Chicago and the suburbs , fueled in part by summer weather . <p> Until three years ago , 34-year-old Marko Djuric of Chicago , with his 1993 modified Toyota Supra , was considered one of the top illegal street racers . " It 's me vs. you for usually a sum of money or for pride to settle the score , " he said recently in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times and NBC5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Djuric said he and his friends routinely raced on the streets of Chicago , at breakneck speeds , sometimes with the knowledge of law enforcement . <p> Djuric defended what he described as the " careful " way the races are run . <p> " Of the thousand-plus street races I have witnessed , " he said , " there has n't been one single incident of one getting hurt or any accident involving any kind of injury . " <p> " Basically , they are breaking the law , " said Deputy Police Chief Mike Shields , whose job it is to try to shut them down . " They like the risk , the fast cars , the women ; it 's just a typical macho thing , " said the nearly 20-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department . <p> Shields ' district covers the South Side , where he said illegal street races are a continuing problem in Chatham and South Shore as well as parts of the Pullman and Grand Crossing neighborhoods . <p> " We 've had problems out here before , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken up , and we 've had some people fight with the police . " <p> But according to a DVD called " Scandalous Street Racing , " which was produced in Chicago and is sold via the Internet , the illegal racing scene in Chicago involves black and white neighborhoods . <p> A deadly sport <p> In April in Gary , four bystanders were killed , including a 6-year-old boy , when a car spun out of control and plunged into a crowd . According to published reports , witnesses said two cars were drag racing . <p> In May in Elgin , police said a drag race took two lives . The 20-year-old driver of one car reportedly lost control , striking several trees . He and his passenger , also 20 , were killed . <p> Also in May , 17-year-old Ryan Meinken of Libertyville died while apparently racing his brother . Authorities said Meinken appeared to be driving in excess of 100 mph . According to Matthew Chancey , chief of the felony review division of the Lake County state 's attorney 's office , an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drag racing appears to have produced a homicide . <p> On the night of May 31 , a shooting erupted in the 8400 block of South Chicago Avenue where , according to police , a large crowd gathered to watch a drag race . Darryl Banks , 34 , a car mechanic , was shot and killed . Six others were injured . An investigation , according to Chicago Police , is ongoing . No one has been arrested . <p> " When you have all of those people together , the potential for violence increases , " said Shields . <p> Who 's racing ? <p> The DVD , produced by On-Airr Productions of Chicago , captures a late-night world of bragging and illegal betting , mostly by young men who appear to be in their 20s and 30s . It was shot on location three years ago in Chicago , Miami and Houston . <p> " My friends are all professionals , " Djuric said two weeks ago , describing in an interview who the racers are . " I mean , there 's a guy who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of police officers . " <p> When asked if Chicago Police officers were involved , he declined to say , but added he has seen off-duty State Police officers at races , as well . <p> " I ca n't mention names , but they have been out with us on more than 10 occasions watching us and helping us do it right , " Djuric said . <p> According to Mike Guglielmucci , host of a weekly racing show on WJOL-AM in Joliet , this kind of racing is not spontaneous but carefully planned . Guglielmucci has been involved with legal racing for more than two decades , and at the Sun-Times ' and NBC5 's request , he viewed the DVD called " Scandalous Street Racing . " <p> " These guys have done their homework , " he said . That includes , he said , using nitrous in their fuel for more acceleration and large gum-ball tires for extra traction . <p> " Whenever you are doing this you are on the edge , " said Guglielmucci . <p> Not cheap <p> Even small-time street racers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30,000 outfitting their cars to race . Djuric , a suburban contractor , said he spent as much as $100,000 retrofitting his car . <p> But Djuric said the recent rash of deaths should not be attributed to those who , like him , have engaged in organized though admittedly illegal street races . <p> " What percent of the people are engaged in street racing as I know it ? " he asked rhetorically . " I do n't know , probably like 10 percent . And the rest are just careless , reckless drivers who are engaging in speed contests randomly on public roads . " <p> Police do n't see much of a distinction and are out , they said , to stop it all . <p> " We have the resources to combat it , " said Shields , but a lot hinges , he admitted , on good intelligence to find and stop events before they get started . <p> ' We put them in jail ' <p> In California , authorities have instituted what are considered the toughest laws in the nation to crack down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2001 , police in San Diego began the Drag-Net program . <p> " We do n't give anybody a ticket , we put them in jail , " said Sgt. Greg Sloan of the San Diego Police Department . <p> San Diego police set out to create " a sense of paranoia " for street racers and spectators . <p> " They want the audience , " he said in a telephone interview . " So we created a spectator ordinance which says if you are there for the purpose of observing , you are guilty of a misdemeanor . " <p> According to Sloan , more enforcement and tougher laws cracked down on events where thousands showed up to watch a series of two-man races . These days , he said , 10 cars constitute a big crowd . <p> " If you are convicted twice of street racing , " Sloan said , " you forfeit the car . " <p> In Los Angeles , the law is even tougher . Authorities , said Sloan , " smash the car " at a junkyard on the first offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing on Chicago streets three years ago and now races only on sanctioned tracks . <p> " There 's too much risk involved now , " he said . " I was successful because I never had an incident or ever witnessed one , but the risk was still there , " Djuric said . " Knowing what I know now , I realize I could have done without all that .
