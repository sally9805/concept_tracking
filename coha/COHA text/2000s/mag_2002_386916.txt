The Scorpion King , a bare-bones prequel to the Mummy movies , gives The Rock a solid step toward stardom . by Owen Gleiberman Photograph // EVERY ERA GETS THE beefed-up action-film demigod it deserves . Twenty years ago . Arnold Schwarzenegger was the right hulk at the right time . His brusque Teutonic accent , like his engorged physique , was always a semijoke , but in the formative years of the Reagan age , his outsize eccentricity was somehow goofy-cool . He seemed to speak to the notion that pure aggressive will , for America at large , remained a somewhat foreign concept . It may be less foreign now . In an age of ongoing military engagement , the ability to assert our will comes a lot more naturally than it once did , and that 's part of the appeal of The Rock : He makes invincible displays of strength look easy and charming . Parody , of course , is built into his act as a professional wrestler , and as he has proved in two appearances on Saturday Night Live , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-mockery that makes Arnold 's look practically medieval in its obviousness . As Mathayus , the ancient desert assassin of The Scorpion King , The Rock commands the screen as naturally as he does the ring , he 's like Arnold with a fresh coat of paint , and a fresh personality , too . In the film 's prologue , he shoots a bow and arrow so hard that the pierced victim goes spinning through the air . Then , in a very calm close-up , he says " Boo ! , " all to let you know that he 's perfectly jovial about the lethal tasks at hand . The camera likes The Rock 's face , and that 's because it 's an interesting face-at once exotic and square-jawed suburban , with small daggers for sideburns , even smaller ones for eyebrows , and shocking white eyes that pop out with the incongruous ferocity of a hypnotist 's . He looks like a cross between Rob Schneider and Tony Robbins , and it 's that small man/big man counterpoint that makes him such an approachable , humanistic giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , but The Scorpion King is n't exactly a lightning vehicle . Executive  --  produced by WWF mastermind Vince McMahon ( a frightening thought ) , and directed by Chuck Russell , who made what is arguably the logiest Schwarzenegger movie ever ( Eraser ) , The Scorpion King is The Rock 's version of Conan the Barbarian-a clunky , primitive platform for a star who has yet to get in full touch with his inner Terminator . The picture is being marketed as a prequel to The Mummy and The Mummy Returns , and technically speaking , that 's exactly what it is . But fans of that series , with its armies of digital goblins that never look too threatening because they appear to be made entirely of fairy-dust pixels , may miss the sensation of spending two hours living inside a videogame . With the exception of one brief sequence , in which The Rock , buried up to his neck in sand , has to withstand an onslaught of creepy  --  crawlies , The Scorpion King is n't a techie-blowout visual  --  effects party . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous sword fights served up every 15 minutes or so , like commercials . In place of the hieroglyphic Indy Jones Lite mumbo jumbo that Brendan Fraser and Co. had so much fun whipping through , we get a lumbering plot in which Mathayus , known as the Akkadian ( he 's the last of a breed ) , is hired to do away with Memnon ( Steven Brand ) , a fascist conqueror in a fancy Mohawk who seems no more threatening than a surly British concert promoter . With his longhaired heavy-metal gladiator stylings , The Rock may have copped his look from Tina Turner 's henchman in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome , but in The Scorpion King , you wish he were surrounded by a comparable level of decadent excitement . Mathayus teams up with one of those scruffy-pest sidekicks ( Grant Heslov ) , who speaks in a nameless foreign accent as he delivers lines like " They 've got the city sealed up tighter than a crab 's buttocks ! " In addition , he absconds with the Sorceress , who has the ability to foresee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't do enough with . As played by Kelly Hu , the Sorceress is n't much more than a midriff and a breathy monotone . As a filmmaker , Chuck Russell has a way of cutting between forceful establishing shots-of a mountain a desert , a castle and close-ups so stagy that they border on invitations to revive Mystery Science Theater 3000 . The Scorpion King as a whole , however , is n't incompetent ; it 's just plodding and obvious . If anything holds it together , it 's The Rock 's ironic ability to tread lightly , which the movie is neither fast nor inventive enough to recognize as different from the spirit of Arnold . With Schwarzenegger , you feel the heavy labor that goes into crushing each foe . The Rock is more like a colossus for the age of special ops : He looks all to happy to kill without bruising .
