<p> When University of Delaware student Tom Isherwood was in Cairo last summer providing legal aid to Somali refugees , he would ask them how many siblings they had . Many answered with a question : Do you want me to count the dead ones ? <p> " It really hit me that these were people my age , 20 or 21 , and our lives could n't be more different , " says Isherwood , who today is one of 20 students named to USA TODAY 's 2006 All-USA College Academic First Team . " Education has been my life , but for most of them , they can count their schooling in months . " <p> Isherwood and the other First Team members have much in common : They have excelled in the classroom , averaging above a 3.9 grade-point average while earning 33 undergraduate majors and a master 's degree . <p> And they have taken their education beyond the lab and lecture hall . Most have studied or worked abroad , collectively reaching every continent . <p> They were selected in USA TODAY 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive trophies and $2,500 cash awards as representatives of all outstanding students . Forty runners-up were named to the Second Team and Third Team . <p> " This year 's honorees represent a new generation with passion , promise and a global perspective . We 're pleased to be able to salute the good work and commitment of these outstanding students , all of whom are destined to make a difference , " USA TODAY Editor Ken Paulson says . <p> Isherwood , a Kansan who had never seen the ocean before enrolling at the University of Delaware , spent two summers in Egypt and Morocco studying Arabic and a month in South Africa studying history and volunteering at an AIDS orphanage . A trilingual double major earning a concurrent master 's degree , he also worked as a teaching assistant in Australia . <p> Other First Team students think globally  --  and act globally : <p> *Invited to Bhutan by the crown prince , HRH Jigme Wangchuck , Merritt Baer of Harvard spent two summers in the Himalayan kingdom developing a conservation plan for the wintering ground of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bhutanese gender power relations . <p> *Studying the Central American peace-building process while at Tufts University , Mauricio Artioano thought world leaders could benefit from analyzing why the Central Americans were successful . While spending a summer in Central America working with Habitat for Humanity , the international student from Costa Rica sold his idea to political , military and economic leaders who brought peace to the region in the 1980s and 1990s . Next month , the first conference on " Lessons Learned on Regional Peacebuilding : The Results of the Central American Peace Process " will be hosted by the Toledo International Center for Peace in Spain . <p> *Christopher Rosson of William Jewell College in Liberty , Mo. , spent a term at Oxford , where he planned an independent research project on Israeli-Palestinian economics . A multi-ethnic resident of a low-income neighborhood in northeast Kansas City , Mo. , Rosson drew on his adaptability to travel throughout Israel and the West Bank during the Gaza disengagement last summer . " My family was n't too thrilled about me going , but what an opportunity to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew everybody would want to talk , " he says . <p> *Kate Harris , a December graduate of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill , spent a month in Antarctica researching water seeps . For the aspiring astronaut , the coldest spot on Earth is the best terrestrial analog for Mars . " If I could n't get to Mars ... Antarctica was the closest substitute , " she says . <p> Community benefits <p> Whether extending their academic talent to help others in a faraway land or using it to improve their communities , First Team members have sought opportunities to stretch themselves . <p> After a year at Duke , Jacqueline Ou took a year off from the " gothic bubble " to volunteer in inner-city Boston . Working on a social justice team , she mediated conflicts and facilitated discussions on discrimination , homophobia , race and class . <p> " I tried to help people see different perspectives on issues . And of course , I learned different perspectives on issues . " <p> Xuan-Trang Ho of Nebraska Wesleyan took out a loan to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an 11-year-old refugee from Vietnam and started learning Spanish as a third language a couple of years later . But she wanted to learn Spanish from a different perspective , one she did n't get helping Hispanic customers when she worked at a Wal-Mart while in high school or doing service projects with the Hispanic community in Lincoln . <p> " It 's the best thing I 've ever done , " she says . Not only was the dialect different in Argentina , but the culture , infused with indigenous Latin American influences , also challenged many of her assumptions . <p> When she came back to Nebraska , Ho spent five months planning a service-learning trip to her home province of Binh Duong . She and two Vietnamese-American friends took 12 fellow students to visit victims of Agent Orange , teach English at a deaf school and meet former Viet Cong guerrillas . " They did n't really think about what the other side was thinking until they met these people , " she says . <p> Getting a project to jell <p> Many First Team members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn opportunities into reality , but they also have demonstrated remarkable initiative and resourcefulness . <p> " You often come across random opportunities , and you either take them or you do n't , " says Baer of Harvard . <p> Getting to Bhutan involved not just researching her projects but also finding funding sources , writing grant proposals and getting proper documentation . " Grant-proposal writing in general is time consuming . You definitely have to have the commitment , " she says . <p> Rosson found no programs to do the type of study he wanted to do in Israel , so he designed one and won research funding from the Hallmark Family Foundation . <p> " I 'm fine doing things other people do n't think are possible if I see a benefit to doing it , " he says . <p> Artioano came up with the idea of conferences to analyze the Central American peace process with Timothy Phillips , co-founder of the Project on Justice in Times of Transition . <p> While researching micro-credit lending in Central America for Habitat for Humanity during the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mentor at Tufts to meet leaders involved , including former heads of state . <p> " It was intimidating , a bit scary at first , " he recalls . But the vision resonated with just about everyone . " The reason it worked out was that peace in Central America is a worthwhile end . " <p> Other First Team members discovered that the power of a good idea , backed by passion and commitment , would allow them to accomplish more than they ever imagined . <p> As a sophomore , Michael Chanin of Northwestern co-founded the Northwestern Conference on Human Rights , which featured former United Nations ambassador Richard Holbrooke . The one-time event turned into an annual one . <p> Chanin chaired last year 's conference with Doctors Without Borders founder Bernard Kouchner , and he is co-chairing this year 's conference , which includes a semester-long academic course , an art exhibit and film festival , and travel grants for 75 students from around the country . <p> " If you 're honest and open , and someone can see you 're genuine about working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not that hard to get people to rally around you , " he says . <p> Such experiences leave many First Team members encouraged about the difference they can make . At least half hope to be policymakers or at least to influence policy . <p> Isherwood believes his hands-on experiences in Africa will help him as a policymaker . <p> " Theory alone does n't do anyone any good . Practice without theory might do more harm than good , " he says . " If you do n't have a hands-on role , that 's when you make bad policy .
