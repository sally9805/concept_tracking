<p> THE billionaire known as Woody looks out from his penthouse on the 49th floor of the Trump International Hotel and Tower on a Manhattan that he hopes to transform . <p> He is one of the biggest Republican fund-raisers in the nation , and his grateful allies  --  President Bush , Gov . George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg  --  make up a rare triple play of powerful support . <p> He is offering $800 million toward a $1.4 billion stadium for the Jets , the team he bought for $635 million in 2001 , unheard-of sums for either a stadium or a team without one . He wants government approvals and $600 million in city and state financing to seal the deal . He is also the glue in far-reaching plans to redevelop the far West Side of Manhattan and to attract the 2012 Olympics . <p> But Robert Wood Johnson IV shuns the spotlight . He strolls unnoticed down the sidewalk in tasseled shoes and rimless spectacles , a trim , balding 57-year-old heir to the Johnson &; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune who really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk only about his charities . He declines interviews for a profile . He tells his closest family members and longtime business associates not to talk about him , either . <p> " Woody is pretty emphatic , " Ron Colangelo , a Jets vice president , said . " He does n't want to do anything publicly . He does n't want to talk . He does n't want to do anything that 's focused on him . " <p> But his importance to the public debate over the future of the West Side is undeniable . Without Johnson , there is no stadium , no Olympic bid , perhaps not even an extension of the No. 7 subway line . His reticence is intriguing . He is not only the most powerful and political of dozens of heirs to the Johnson &; Johnson fortune , he is also the most enigmatic . <p> Public records and interviews with former business associates suggest many new details about Johnson 's past , offering a fuller picture of his attributes and personality than the gloss of family , philanthropy and football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurial decade as a young man in Florida , Johnson showed qualities that might surprise his friends among New York 's elite . He was unorthodox . He took risks . He stepped in when banks would not finance fledgling cable systems . He flexed power . He made good money . And he could be tough . <p> " When you have a billion and the small partner at 25 percent does n't have it , you can sort of run over him and do what you want , ca n't you ? " said a former business partner , Michael Richard Spielvogel . " His money and his power ran away from me . " <p> After moving to New York in 1984 , Johnson concentrated on managing his money and rearing a family . He also became a leading contributor to philanthropic causes , particularly foundations working to promote research into diabetes and lupus , autoimmune diseases that have afflicted two of his three children . <p> He became a leading donor , as well , to the Republican Party and to individual candidates , building alliances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public consensus behind the Jets ' highly disputed proposal for a new stadium and convention hall , which would be by far the most expensive stadium built in the United States . <p> Problems in Florida <p> The unvarnished Johnson is revealed , though , in his early business experiences . His Jets biography mentions the cable business in Florida , but not the real estate deals . Research in Florida shows those dealings were marred by a bitter fight with Spielvogel , charges of fraud in civil suits by at least two condo buyers and a ruling that held Johnson in contempt of court in a dispute over his personal condo fees . <p> For a time , Johnson wore long blond hair and a Fu Manchu mustache . It was the 1970 's , after all , and he was always the richest young man around . In a deposition , he listed his occupation as construction . <p> Spielvogel , a hustling real estate developer from Long Island , was Johnson 's partner for four years in ventures named Woodric Enterprises , after their middle names . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his zipper open and sandals on , long straggly hair , " Spielvogel said . " I did n't know who he was . " They went out drinking , hit it off , and when they next met , Johnson was zipped up , wearing a tie and arriving by private plane , wowing Spielvogel 's teenage secretary . <p> " He comes in and first thing out of his mouth was , ' My family and I checked you out , and I want to do ' bidness ' with you , " ' Spielvogel said . " He said , ' You did n't have any family money ; you did it on your own . ' And basically : ' Teach me . I 'll give you 10 percent of the first deal and 25 percent of every deal thereafter if you just sell your operations in New York and move to Florida . ' And that 's basically what I did . <p> " He was the money . I was the brains . " <p> The partnership started well , but it ended badly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joel Latman , an accountant , or John L. Cody , a banker , had to co-sign the checks to develop Woodric Runaway Bay Apartments in Fort Lauderdale . Spielvogel had no spending authority . Woodric also developed a condo project in Coral Springs , north of Fort Lauderdale , and a Holiday Inn near Boca Raton 's beaches . <p> Two condo buyers sued over what they described as fraudulent or misleading sales activity ; one won $5,480 and the other settled for an undisclosed amount . Johnson 's role was unclear from court records . He was personally sued for $1,394 in unpaid dues at the luxury Corinthian Condo in Broward County , where he lived , in 1976 . A judge found Johnson in contempt of court in the case . Further details could not be learned , because the court file has been purged , the lawyer for the condominium is dead and Johnson declined to be interviewed . <p> Spielvogel held a nonvoting 25 percent share in Woodric and worked for $700 a week , he said , when Latman persuaded Johnson to squeeze him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for comment . ) Spielvogel said he had been forced to sell out for less than he thought his share was worth because he needed money for food and rent . <p> " Basically I was strangled , financially strangled , " Spielvogel said . <p> But then he filed an affidavit in Broward County saying he had given up his interest in one real estate project " under extreme duress and coercion inflicted on me by Robert Wood Johnson IV . " <p> Later , Spielvogel said , he accepted $55,000 to give up his 25 percent share in Woodric and withdraw the charges of coercion . Woodric later turned out to be worth many millions , Spielvogel said . Today , he said of Johnson : " I wish him well . I do n't begrudge him anything . I 've moved on with my life , he 's moved on with his life . " <p> Johnson has cut off all contact . In 1998 , Spielvogel phoned to say that his daughter , whom Johnson had known as a baby , had died . Johnson did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he said : " Look , the man is a good man . He just owes me a smile and some Jets tickets . " <p> Spielvogel still works in Florida real estate . In 2001 , he and Dr. James Scott Pendergraft , the owner of five abortion clinics in Florida , were convicted of attempted extortion in connection with negotiations with Marion County government over a possible new clinic . They each spent eight months in prison before a federal appeals court overturned the convictions . Spielvogel said the case had been politically motivated . <p> Johnson continued in Florida real estate after breaking up his partnership with Spielvogel . Sometimes he acted as a bank . At least 10 times from 1977 to 1981 , he issued mortgages from his personal finances to people who wanted to buy property from him . <p> He also used his financial clout to cash in on the early days of cable television in Florida . His next partner , Robert S. Gordon , said Johnson had invested $500,000 in 1975 when banks would not touch cable and Gordon desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eight towns in Broward County , but he did not have the capital to start laying cable . Between 1977 and 1981 , Johnson also personally loaned Gordon and his wife $350,000 , according to deeds . Johnson bought Gordon out of the cable business , but unlike with Spielvogel , he had never been friends with Gordon . <p> " Bob Johnson kept pretty well to himself , " Gordon recalled . " He wanted to keep himself behind the scenes . " <p> A businessman named Neil J. Burmeister was working with Gordon on the cable franchises . Burmeister has stayed with Johnson to this day , becoming Johnson 's right-hand man in all of his business and investment ventures . <p> Johnson sold the cable franchises for $10 million in 1983 , Florida property records show . It is impossible to estimate his profit , though Gordon said it was large . Comcast now owns the franchises . <p> " He sold out for a considerable amount of money and went on to other things , " Gordon said . <p> Family Matters <p> Johnson had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grew up in affluent areas in New Jersey , attended the elite Millbrook School in the Hudson Valley and worked menial summer jobs at Johnson &; Johnson with the expectation of ascending to the top of the family business . <p> Robert Wood Johnson , his great-grandfather and first namesake , had co-founded the company in 1886 . Robert Wood Johnson II , by all accounts a driven and visionary businessman who was nicknamed General Johnson , built it into the world 's largest health-care company . <p> Woody Johnson 's father , Robert Wood Johnson III , who was called Bobby , worked for the company from 1941 to 1965 , rising to president of domestic operations . At one point , he wrote to the General : " From the time I was three years old I have had but one goal  --  our Company . I have brought my own boys up in the same atmosphere . " <p> But thunder struck in 1965 , when Woody Johnson was 18 : His father was fired by his grandfather . <p> " The General stopped at nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous men , he thought his own son was worthless , " an in-law named Nicholas Rutgers is quoted as saying in the book " Johnson v. Johnson " by Barbara Goldsmith ( Knopf 1987 ) . " He used to tell my mother : ' Bobby is nothing . Bobby will amount to nothing . " ' <p> Woody 's mother , Betty Wold Johnson , was quoted in the book as saying : " After it happened , people we 'd known all our lives would turn away . I guess I do n't blame them  --  it was a company town , they were interested in keeping their jobs and their houses and their two-car garages . But it was hard . " <p> Woody , who was completing prep school at the time , then went west to attend the University of Arizona in Tucson . His family left New Jersey for Florida . <p> Johnson 's father died of cancer at the age of 50 in 1970 . And since his grandfather , General Johnson , had died in 1968 , Woody Johnson had no entree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Florida to prove his business worth . <p> More personal misfortune followed . Two younger brothers died in 1975 , Keith from a cocaine overdose and Billy in a motorcycle accident . Woody was 28 at the time . That left him with a sister , Elizabeth ( Libet ) Ross Johnson , who is three years his junior , and a brother , Christopher Wold Johnson , 12 years his junior . The three surviving siblings were left the entire estates of their two deceased brothers , making them by far the wealthiest of the more than 30 people in the fourth generation of Johnsons . <p> While pursuing his business ventures in Florida , Woody Johnson met and married Nancy Sale Frey , the daughter of a St. Louis business family . They moved to New York in 1984 . He set up The Johnson Company , with offices in Rockefeller Center , and merged Woodric into it . Burmeister is the president of the company , which oversees Johnson 's assets . <p> " We 've been friends for 30 years now ; obviously that says something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burmeister said in a brief telephone conversation before repeatedly declining to make any further comment . <p> Between 1984 and 2000 , Johnson 's main activities appeared to be rearing a family , managing his money and donating to Republican and philanthropic causes . <p> Johnson has given more than $1.2 million to political campaigns since 1988 , campaign records show , overwhelmingly to Republicans , including $100,000 chunks of so-called soft money to Republican campaign committees five times from 1988 to 1998 . He donated $25,000 a year to join Team 100 , a group of business leaders pledging to counteract fund-raising by the Democrats ' major donors . <p> " I have co-chaired Team 100 since 1996 , and Woody has always been there , " said Julie Finley , a Washington fund-raiser , describing Johnson as " warm , outgoing and generous , totally unpretentious , a very nice man . " <p> He has also donated smaller amounts to more than 55 candidates . He gave $4,000 to Rudolph W. Giuliani 's mayoral campaign in 1989 and $10,000 to Pataki for his first gubernatorial race in 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush , first visiting him in Texas in 1994 , giving $22,583 to his gubernatorial campaign that year and joining business leaders who gathered in Texas in 1998 to promote Bush for president . Johnson impressed them by showing up for a bird-hunting trip with an elephant gun . <p> More than his wallet , Johnson brings his Rolodex to politics . In 1999 , he raised $700,000 in a single event for Bush . Some people were not impressed . " My take on the guy is here 's a rich kid who wants to be a player in the Republican Party and living off the family inheritance , " said Jaime Court , president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in California , a consumer activist group . <p> Giving From the Heart <p> Johnson 's philanthropy , like his grandfather 's , sets him apart from some billionaires . He has also been more than willing to use his political clout to help his philanthropy , which , in turn , helps two of his daughters , who have autoimmune diseases . <p> Casey , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Type 1 diabetes as an 8-year-old in 1988 . Woody and Sale Johnson wrote the book " Managing Your Child 's Diabetes " ( Mastermedia 1992 ) . They also donated $10 million to a $100 million diabetes campaign in 1994 and at least $5 million since then . They divorced amicably in 2001 . <p> " He 's extraordinarily committed , passionate , very direct , very focused upon the results which he wants , demands a good deal , but at the same time is hearing alternatives and considering issues , " said Peter Van Etten , chief executive officer of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation , which Johnson co-founded . " He 's a very direct and forceful person . He wants a cure . " <p> Johnson is also an effective lobbyist , Van Etten said . " When there 's an issue and we need help in terms of getting support from a congressman , Woody will at the drop of a hat go down and spend his time trying to convince him , and he does it in a very personal way , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2002 , Johnson successfully lobbied members of Congress for a five-year , $750 million guaranteed funding package for diabetes research , which was " unprecedented on Capitol Hill to be doing special funding for any disease group at that level , " said Ken Van Pool , an aide to Representative George Nethercutt , Republican of Washington and chairman of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus . <p> Another of Johnson 's daughters , Jaime , was found to have lupus , an inflammatory disease that can damage vital organs , when she was 13 in 1999 . Johnson co-founded the Alliance for Lupus Research and pays all administrative costs , so that all of the donations go to research . <p> Johnson joined the board of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in 2001 . He was the only family member to be asked to join the board of the charity set up by his grandfather 's bequest . <p> With about $8 billion in assets and $1 billion in annual giving , it is the nation 's largest charity devoted exclusively to health care . <p> A Quiet Figure <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , brother and sister are minority shareholders , Colangelo , the Jets ' spokesman , said . They bought the team in January 2000 , outbidding Charles F. Dolan , the chairman of Cablevision , who is now financing television ads against Johnson 's plan to build a new stadium , which would compete with Madison Square Garden , a Cablevision subsidiary . The Jets now play at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. <p> Johnson quickly hired Jay Cross from the N.B.A. 's Heat in Miami , where Cross had marshaled community support for a new arena . As president of the Jets , Cross said he meets with Johnson every day for about two hours to talk about stadium and financial issues . <p> " He 's very gregarious , " Cross said . " He 's open . A lot of people when they meet him come away with the feeling that he 's just like them . " <p> Asked why Johnson declined to be interviewed for a profile , Cross said : " He 's a private person . People of his stature are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think we have to respect that . Because once you start , where do you stop ? " <p> Two former business associates suggested another reason Johnson might want to stay out of the news media . Spielvogel said , " Bob was always worried about kidnapping . " <p> Another former associate , who asked not to be identified , agreed , saying , " He is n't trying to hide anything , except himself .
