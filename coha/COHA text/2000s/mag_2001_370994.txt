If you suffer from persistent aches and pains in your lower back , it may be of small comfort to know you 're not alone . As many as 80% of adults in the U.S. experience significant lower-back pain at some time during their life , making it second only to the common cold as a cause of lost workdays among those under age 45 . The good news is that most cases are n't serious and respond well to simple treatments such as physical therapy and over-the-counter medications . But for some patients , pain persists , making them desperate to find any means of relief . <P> If you 're in this group , your answer could well be a new , minimally invasive procedure called nucleoplasty . In less than an hour , most patients walk out of the doctor 's office  --  yes , walk  --  and are free of much of their pain . To be sure , nucleoplasty is not for everyone . According to Dr. Yung Chen , director of the Stanford Interventional Spine Center in Stanford , Calif. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk  --  meaning the damaged disk has n't completely ruptured or extruded too far outside its normal confines within the spinal column . <P> Healthy disks are like a car 's shock absorbers . A soft , gel-like substance in their center , or nucleus , helps cushion the jolts caused by simple movements like running and jumping . But for various reasons , a disk 's hard , protective shell can degenerate , allowing the spongy interior to bulge out and press on spinal nerves . This can cause excruciating pain that radiates down the leg in a condition commonly called sciatica . <P> Nucleoplasty ( literally , removing the nucleus ) is aimed at relieving that pressure . Using only local anesthesia and light sedation , which allows the patient to remain awake , the doctor inserts a needle into the distended disk and is guided by an X-ray imaging system that reveals the needle 's position at all times . A wandlike device is then threaded through the needle and into the disk . There it emits a burst of radio-frequency energy that heats and almost instantly vaporizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . <P> Although more than 2,500 nucleoplasties have already been performed ( at an average cost of $5,000 to $7,000 ) , Dr. Chen readily admits that long-term , controlled studies are still needed to judge their usefulness . Still , he 's pleased with the response of his patients so far . On average , they report a 70% reduction in their pain . And within one week , most are able to begin a physical-therapy program to bolster the procedure 's relieving effects . <P> Nucleoplasty , though less invasive than spinal surgery , is not entirely risk free . ( Potential complications : bleeding , infection and nerve damage . ) But without cutting , the risks are drastically reduced . And for those whose disks are only a little misaligned but still intact , nucleoplasty might finally provide some welcome relief . <P> Dr. Ian appears on NBC 's Today show .
