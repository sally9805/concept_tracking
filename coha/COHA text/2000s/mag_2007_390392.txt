Headnote This Maryland oil painter , renowned for her portraits , seeks the essence of her subjects and settles for nothing less . When we remember a friend 's face , we do n't see the eyes , the smile , the mouth . We feel that friend 's touch , hear her laugh , recall his courage . Maryland oil painter Carolyn Egeli 's portraits evoke that essence . How does she imbue her subjects with life and soul ? " Carolyn 's work has an honesty about it that can not be taught , " observes renowned portraitist and former Egeli student Thomas V. Nash . There are , however , some useful suggestions we can extract from her observations on portraiture . First , consider carefully how to position the figure in a portrait . Egeli cautions against the artist , and thus the viewer , getting too close and looking down on the subject , especially if the portrait is three-quarter length , including the subject 's hands and lap . If the focus is the eyes and the artist looks down , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen simultaneously without distorting the perspective , which results in the subject appearing to float above the chair or couch in the painting . However , a viewpoint with correct perspective , looking down at the sitter , conveys vulnerability and drama . A viewpoint looking up at the subject can give the impression of nobility and authority , but that perspective can also cause elongation of the features at the bottom of the face . The third option , and perhaps the most customary , is keeping the sitter 's head at the artist 's eye level . Seating the subject on a platform may be necessary to achieve this . Most important in choosing a perspective is that the pose must express the subject 's personality and capture the spirit of the sitter . Another crucial key to compelling portraits : Make time your ally . Egeli takes frequent breaks as a painting progresses-she works on another painting , plays the piano or exercises , and then returns to the painting refreshed . As the piece takes on its own life , " I assess and compare what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing with better proportions , sometimes pumping up or modifying the value differences . I make sure the action is enough , is interesting . I keep comparing and building up all over the canvas , staying general as long as I can stand it , then I begin to pin down things as I work over ttie painting . At this point in the process , I do n't paint more than 2o minutes at a time . And I make sure my lighting source is steady ; I do n't chase the direction of the light . " Third , Egeli urges artists to seek a coordination of eye and heart . In part , she avoids relying on photos for more than reference . " Slavishly copying photos means you 're copying distortions , " she says . " Often the centers of faces end up too big or faces become too long , depending on the lens and the distance from which the photo is taken . The artist chases his or her tail , unable to figure out why the likeness is missing the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement at the beginning . " As I correct or modify the drawing it becomes a lot more accurate , " says Egeli . " But without attention to movement and motive , the painting falters , the passion fails . " She relies on her instincts-grounded in skill and courage-to capture the feelings that can infuse a painting with life . And finally , Egeli recommends that artists take care not to focus on one particular feature . Do n't be beguiled , for example , by the eyes . As Egeli cautions her students , " You have to build the house before you can put in the windows . " Every element of the landscape or the face and body holds interest and demands patient attention . When the curves of the ear , the angle of the brow , and the shadow of the chin have received the artist 's close scrutiny , the portrait becomes organic . In the double portrait of Stanley J. and Sandra Sweikar , Egeli first sketched the couple 's general shapes and positions on the canvas . Often she sketches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does this rough sketch , another creative process goes on simultaneously : Egeli listens to her subjects . She listens for what they think and feel ; she observes the messages they convey with their bodies , their expressions . There is something to be learned even from what is not said or what is not done . Egeli is an astute observer ; she interprets motive and meaning instinctively . Her visual vocabulary expresses both parties ' feelings - the finished portrait tells something of the sitter 's story as well as the artist 's . AU that Egeli sees and feels becomes part of the portrait . In the Sweikar portrait , the angles of the couple 's postures reflect the openness between them ; their clasped hands resting close to each other 's bodies suggest intimacy and the triumph of a successful marriage . Their gazes look out at the viewer , confident , unguarded , and at ease . As the portrait took shape , the coloring of the forward figure emerged . Egeli is careful with the flesh tones . " Sargent used ochre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fingertips . Smashing ! " the artist says . " My father , Bjorn Egeli , taught me to use Mars violet and cobalt blue for the darks , blending into greenish umbers for the halftones . The halftones move to the peachy-ochre of general flesh tones in the light . The warm planes are dropped in with red cadmiums where the cheek turns , and the value moves to the dark side . The warm side of the cheek , closer to the light , is a warmer red , and the other cheek , closer to the shadow side , has a cooler red going into the shadow . " In reflected light the colors move to pale greens , yellows , or whites , depending on the color of the light hitting the subject , " continues Egeli . " Then , in the light , the values end up very high key with infinite modeling . Approaching the face through close modeling in the light is a very demanding task . A less demanding way to paint the face is with a generally darker range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlights on the face . " I always tell my students , " Hold onto the feeling you first experience when you looked at the scene or person you 're about to paint , ' ' " says Egeli . " That feeling must remain when the work is finished . Harness your passion ; process it . Passion is essential . Take the time to analyze , but be careful not to stultify and overanalyze what you see and feel . " Egeli continues , " In part , the artist must mirror the subject . In the case of a portrait , I try to become familiar with the subject 's lifestyle and tastes . As an artist , I focus on the subject 's identity . I try to be honest , expressing what I see in my subject , keeping in mind what is appropriate for the purpose of the portrait . As the artist , I receive a commission because of my taste and insight , so I remain true to that , but I 'm also open to the viewpoints of my sitter . Developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefits of portrait painting . " Egeli 's parents , Lois Baldwin Egeli and Bjorn Egeli , were both accomplished painters , so earning a living as an artist came naturally to her . She recalls playing as a child in the offices of a Supreme Court Justice while her father painted the judge 's portrait . Over the last 20 years of her father 's life , Egeli accompanied him to sittings . Serving as Bjorn Egeli 's driver gave his talented daughter the opportunity to observe the relationship between artist and subject , as well as gain an understanding of the business of painting portraits of famous and important people-governors , corporate presidents , statesmen , and judges . Bjorn and Lois Egeli 's legacy includes not only their careers in painting but five children who became successful artists as well . The dynasty they founded ( three generations so far ) has been compared to the renowned Peales of the 19th century and the Wyeths , whose generations are contemporary with the Egelis . Each of these painterly dynasties established a unique vision , a quality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paintings by both parents hang beside her own pieces in the home Egeli built on the banks of Herring Creek in Southern Maryland . In that bucolic setting , her work is entwined with her private life . The home 's design provides light-filled galleries and studio spaces where clients and guests from across the country and around the world come to study , purchase paintings , and pose for portraits . " I treat art as a job I respect , " says Egeli . " Painting has fundamental principles , a language that can be understood . One 's images and materials are the vocabulary ; the characteristics of the materials and the elements of design and color are the grammar of painting . I urge my students to apply those principles of art to produce paintings imbued with the student 's own individual passion and energy . " If the pigment , canvas , and varnish constitute her vocabulary , design and structure are the grammar that provides order and control . Egeli speaks the artist 's language fluently . She begins with the best quality materials available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushes , and the classic mediums of turpentine , damar varnish , and coldpressed linseed oil . " I use cold-pressed because it reduces " suedeing " on the surface of the painting , " she says . The artist notes that contemporary art supplies , unlike the materials of her youth , tend to dry quickly , forcing the artist to plan ahead but saving time between the stages of painting . Egeli is particular about the character of her paints . She mixes her own white paint using pigment from Sinopia , a San Francisco company . When made with the proper linseed oil , this homemade white has superior coverage and mobility . Old Holland paints are noted for their archival quality and drenching color . Egeli usually applies a ground to her canvas or gessoed board , often a neutral hue of medium value . If she desires a cool backdrop , the artist may use a mixture of cobalt blue , raw umber , and white . For a warm ground , she 'll use a mixture of sienna and burnt umber . " As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazes or a loaded brush , depending on the subject matter , " she says . The artist may repeatedly return to a landscape site or a studio arrangement to sketch and photograph her subject , sometimes doing two or three small exploratory paintings . " Sometimes I see the whole at once , " Egeli says . " But being willing to explore is extremely important . I call that the honest search . The honest search uncovers the artist 's skill and excitement about the subject matter , if they 're there . Enough truth should be in the painting to carry the day . " The ongoing study of the subject matter is crucial to her approach . " Art is not in the technique or principles , " says Egeli . " It 's in the understanding - understanding what you see and seeing in three dimensions . Finishing a portrait or any painting is a monumental task .
