<p> As you fork into the Dungeness crab , mango and avocado salad ( $12.95 ) at Brasserie de la Mer , you get a sense the chef is about to break out and become a star . It 's a feeling that follows through the savory courses  --  the preparations are consistently good , peppered with glimmers of greatness . <p> The problem is that Liz Ozanich , who worked five years at the Heathman in Portland under chef Philippe Boulot , is shackled with a dining room that has all the cachet of a Denny 's . Part of the new 155-room Vineyard Creek Hotel Spa and Conference Center in Santa Rosa , the Craftsman-style interior makes a good first impression , but it does n't last . <p> The structure looks particularly inviting from the outside , with stucco walls and a stone entrance . Inside , the eye is drawn first to the bright open kitchen on one side and then to the bar on the other , which looks like a Tahoe ski lodge with its massive fireplace . However , a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host stand works against the idea that this is a fine-dining establishment . <p> Since the restaurant serves three meals a day , the first dining room has the look of a coffee shop , with the more serious dining room up a couple of stairs . Unfortunately , the effect is cheapened by a ceiling dotted with too many stained-glass chandeliers and too much leaded glass in the wood partitions that define the dining rooms . The rust-colored walls and romantic landscape paintings give the place a rich look , but again the impression is dashed by plastic-looking " cut glass " candle holders on the tables and catering-quality glassware . The look unravels even more in a rest room with inexpensive ceramic tile , poor caulk job around the vanity and the same stained-glass wall sconces used in the dining room , turned sideways over the sink and unframed mirror . <p> The real problem , however , is the table arrangement in the main dining room . The booths along the back wall are uncomfortable . The rest of the dining room is filled with tables set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , the staff is continually carrying away place settings to accommodate smaller parties . On one visit , for example , there were three large parties , nine tables of two and no parties of four . Whoever designed the room must never have spent much time dining out , because every place you sit feels like the worst seat in the house . <p> Decor aside , Brasserie de la Mer has a lot to offer if your primary reason for dining is food . Clearly Ozanich is a chef to watch . If business starts to wane after the holidays , the restaurant could easily draw a crowd for its fish and chips ( $15.50 ) alone . The chef dusts four Pacific rock cod fillets with bread crumbs and a delicate tempura-like batter and fries them to a mahogany hue . She arranges them in a white butcher-paper envelope on a bed of golden French fries . The plate is accompanied by an excellent , slightly acidic tartar sauce and a container of malt vinegar . <p> The seasonality of the menu also speaks highly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , so it seems appropriate that at least a half dozen dishes include Dungeness crab . The crab cakes ( $11.25 ) are exceptional . They 're ragged on the edges , looking kind of like a small latke , and the two patties are stacked on a cherry tomato , fennel and cucumber salad . The crab is lightly seasoned , letting the natural sweetness of the seafood bloom against the hot , crunchy exterior . <p> The delicate , vaguely floral nuances of crab are also enhanced with a silky Meyer lemon custard ( $13.75 ) that 's topped with snowy flakes of seafood , a small dollop of caviar , a circle of stewed leeks and chive essence swirling around the white plate . <p> Crab also becomes the star of the bouillabaisse ( $22.75 ) , in which the choice lumps are extracted from the shell and scattered over the saffron-tomato broth , chunky with strands of fennel . It flavors the mussels , clams , prawns and the fillet of salmon and petrale sole . Croutons , slathered with spicy rouille , give the palate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stew . <p> The restaurant also serves Hog Island Sweetwater Pacific oysters ( $10.25 ) on the half shell , and they 're so sweet with a cucumber essence that you do n't even need the accompanying Champagne mignonette or squeeze of fresh lemon . <p> Generally Ozanich 's combinations are right on track , whether it 's the bacon-battered fillet of Atlantic salmon ( $19.95 ) enhanced with a sherry brown butter sauce , all presented on a mound of spinach risotto ( too bad the kitchen let it become mushy ) , or a classic petrale sole ( $15.75 ) with white wine , a touch of cream and a garnish of clams and mussels . <p> For those who do n't like seafood , the menu features a hanger steak with a whiskey black peppercorn sauce ( $17.75 ) and a chicken breast ( $17.50 ) that has a sauce that tastes similar to good old American barbecue . It 's served with a hearty mix of mushrooms , bacon lardons , rainbow chard and fingerling potatoes . <p> Unfortunately desserts  --  and service  --  need work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $7.25 ) back to the kitchen . Why put hard bits of pralines , brownie crumbs and fudge sauce into the glass with the ice cream and soda ? The chocolate gives the whole thing a metallic flavor , and the crumbs quickly become soggy . The deep-dish apple pie ( $6.85 ) had such a strong perfume that I felt as if I had walked into Illuminations . Pumpkin pot de creme ( $6.75 ) was a nice idea , but the dish ultimately failed because of a generous scattering of rancid-tasting sugared pecans . The best item was the milk chocolate mousse ( $8 ) , with a layer of peanut butter crunch , followed by the chocolate mousse and espresso creme anglaise . The bread pudding with caramel sauce ( $5.25 ) was also good , although it was hard to eat because the waiter forgot to bring utensils . <p> On several occasions we had to nab flatware from other tables when we could n't get anyone 's attention . One time as we desperately tried , three people were convened around a large round table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flaps to convert it into a table for four . After finally resetting it , the host seated a party of two , so the staff again scurried around to remove two place settings . Throughout it all , the busboys roamed the room , fussing with the empty tables but never looking at the occupied ones . So if you want plates removed , you often have to ask . <p> The unobservant staff tries to compensate for the training deficit by being exceedingly friendly . It 's as if a group of novices got together and said : " Hey , let 's run a restaurant . " The overall experience is n't bad for an amateur production , but a chef as good as Ozanich deserves a little more supporting power to make her shine . <p> Large , but uninspired , wine list <p> The 125-item wine list at Brasserie de la Mer is filled with good wines , but there 's not a lot of personality , or much thought to how the list might support the food . <p> The list is heavily weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's location in the Sonoma Wine Country . Although the list includes some French wines , most are bistro quality , and the food is much more refined . <p> The list is weighted toward red selections , but many seafood dishes cry out for the French whites  --  either the 1999 Marc Kreydenweiss " Les Charmes " Pinot Blanc ( $28 ) from Alsace or the 1999 Miche Redde " La Moynerie " Pouilly Fume ( $32 ) . Diners looking for a light red , particularly for the bouillabaisse , should consider the 1999 Domaine Fougeray de Beauclair Marsannay ( $34 ) . <p> The by-the-glass list is interesting , featuring about 20 wines . In addition there are 10 dessert wines and ports , seven bourbons and 18 scotches . <p> Pricing is on the high side ; some wines are much more than double retail , although often the most expensive wines are marked up less . <p> BRASSERIE DE LA MER <p> 170 Railroad Ave .
