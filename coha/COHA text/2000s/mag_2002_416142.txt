Like Generations Of Painters Before Them , Artists From Around The Globe Go To Paris To Copy The Masterpieces At The Louvre <p> The Louvre has been open only a few minutes , but already crowds are sauntering through its vast galleries . Up on the second floor , in a long , red- walled room devoted to 19th-century French paintings , a group is gathering around a young woman wearing a black velvet tunic and a floor-length silk skirt . Her glossy auburn hair braided and coiled around her head , she sits on a stool before an easel , deftly applying paint to a canvas . Some of the visitors hang back , stare dubiously , then wander off . Others crowd in for a better look , glancing from the famous 19th-century painting on the wall , The Women of Algiers by Eugne Delacroix , to the copy on the easel . " Boy , she 's really good , " someone whispers . " Aw , I bet she 's doing it by the numbers , " comes the response . <p> Sorrel Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing that curious paradox  --  an original , fully creative copy  --  she is also carrying on a venerable tradition . Ever since the museum opened its treasures to public view in November 1793 ( one of the indisputable benefits of the French Revolution ) , it has allowed , even encouraged , artists to hone their skills by copying the masterpieces in its collections . Thousands have done so , including great classical painters from Turner to Ingles , Impressionists from Manet to Degas , and modernists like Chagall and Giacometti . " You have to copy and recopy the masters , " Degas insisted , " and it 's only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish . " <p> <p> The Louvre 's attraction is profound . When 23-year-old Marc Chagall arrived in Paris in 1910 from Russia , he went there directly from the train station , suitcase in hand . " Going to the Louvre is like reading the Bible or Shakespeare , " he later said . Paul C &eactue; zanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek and Roman statues . " The Louvre is the book where we learn to read , " he declared . <p> Though most of them are women , today 's copyists are an otherwise varied lot . Of the 150 artists who executed 269 copies during the 2000-200l painting season , nearly three out of four were art students or in artistic professions . But there was also a psychoanalyst , a surgeon , a midwife and 13 retirees . Three out of four , also , were French , but there were 20 Americans , the largest foreign group . Maten de Ferrier , the enthusiastic head of the office that runs the copyist program , believes a stint at the Louvre is a rite of passage . " These artists like to follow in the footsteps of all the great painters who have copied here , " she explains . " And , of course , they also come to improve their technique , to find solutions to their artistic problems . " Some , however  --  like eccentric Surrealist Salvador Dal , who created a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to use masterworks as a point of departure . Picasso , who copied at the Louvre in the 195os to recharge his creative batteries , produced a series of interpretations of Delacroix 's The Women of Algiers ( the same work now being copied by Sorrell Smith ) after noticing a marked resemblance between one of the women in the painting and his then companion , Jacqueline Roque . <p> At the moment , Sorrel Smith 's problem is getting Delacroix 's composition and colors just right . An accomplished technician who likes to do miniature portraits on ivory , Smith came to Paris with the Wells canvases . " Making my own paints with earth pigments means I do n't have to search for the colors the old masters used , because I 'm starting from the same point they did , " she explains . " In this painting the colors are very vibrant and at the same time muted , creating a difficult balance . It 's the hardest copy I 've ever done . " <p> Difficulty is what most Louvre copyists seek . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old masters , and to meet it you have to extend yourself , " says Mary Chavance , a French artist who does mainly Impressionist-style landscapes in her Left Bank studio . But here , on the opposite side of the Seine , in the Louvre 's bustling Grande Galerie ( devoted to French , Italian and Spanish classical paintings ) , she is grappling with an aristocrat in gleaming armor by Caravaggio . The work is typical of the Baroque artist 's Tenebrism  --  the depiction of dramatically illuminated forms emerging from shadow . Her version looks perfect , but she 's not satisfied . " If you do n't copy , you wo n't advance , " she says . " But you ca n't do it passively . You have to involve yourself deeply in creating something that 's more than just a reproduction of a painting . " <p> That seems to have been the idea when the museum opened its doors two centuries ago . " Each visitor should be able to put his easel in front of any painting or statue to draw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early official . But the Louvre was soon so flooded with artists that the museum had to start issuing authorizations and limiting hours for copyists . ( Today , copying is permitted from 9 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. , September through June , except Tuesdays , Sundays and holidays . ) In the early days , art students , never known for their decorum , often had to be reminded to refrain from games , singing and horsing around in what was supposed to be , according to Louvre authorities , a " sanctuary of silence and meditation . " <p> Not everyone came to the Louvre for purely aesthetic reasons . In the mid-19th century , mothers often chaperoned their copyist daughters , concerned that representations of scantily clad bodies might be corrupting or that male copyists had more on their minds than offers of artistic instruction . To such prospective swains , the 19th-century novelist Champfleury offered an effective approach : " Copy a painting next to hers , then ask to borrow some cadmium or cobalt . Then correct the odious mess of colors she calls a painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about the Old Masters until the Louvre closes and you have to continue the conversation in the street . Improvise the rest . " <p> By the middle of the 19th century , hundreds of artists were busily copying masterpieces , mainly to satisfy orders from clients . Many visitors , wending through a veritable forest of easels , ordered copies on the spot . Thus the Louvre offered artists the possibility of income ( though by the 189os , photography had reduced demand ) , as well as a dry and heated place to work . <p> Still , many of today 's Louvre copyists sell their works . A few art galleries near the museum market them , and some artists , such as Amal Dagher , who has been copying for 30 years and is considered the unofficial dean of Louvre copyists , sell directly to visitors . Born in Lebanon , the affable 63year-old Dagher studied for four years at Beirut 's Academy of Fine Arts , and later in India , Thailand and Japan , before settling in Paris . He is working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoclassicist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres , who , along with Delacroix , is among the most copied of the Louvre 's masters because of his rigorous composition and subtle coloring . ( One of the world 's most famous paintings , Leonardo 's Mona Lisa , is one of the least copied  --  partly because the crowds that flock to the painting make it hard for an artist to set up an easel and partly because , according to Ferrier , its fame intimidates . ) <p> " Caroline Rivire died at 14 , about a year after she posed for Ingres , " says Dagher . " I believe he was trying to present an idealized vision of her . She is almost an Italian Madonna , and the challenge here is to achieve the form that he gave her , making her seem to float above the background . " Despite his many years of copying , Dagher admits to feeling a sort of stage fright every time he faces a blank canvas . " That 's a good sign , " he says . " If you 're too satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dagher also values the Louvre for the access it gives him to the public . " Not many people passing through actually buy my copies , " he says , " but often they will ask me to do something else for them . " Some want him to make copies of portraits of their ancestors so they can give them to other family members . One American visitor asked him to paint a reproduction of a Versailles ceiling fresco at the visitor 's home in Connecticut . " The gold-leaf molding alone cost nearly $60,000 , " Dagher recalls . " That was a lot more than I asked for doing the painting . " <p> But not everyone wants to sell their copies . Gilles Malzieux is interested only in creating his own collection . Malzieux , 45 , knows the Louvre better than most . He works there as a security officer . When not keeping an eye out for pickpockets , he returns to the museum with brushes and paint . " I take days off from my vacation time to do this , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach . " Malzieux began copying six years ago because he loved paintings but could n't afford to buy them . Self-taught , he does four or five copies a year . He 's currently working on a rendering of The Ferry by 17th-century Dutch landscape painter Salomon van Ruysdael . " I chose this one because it 's a seascape  --  a glaze without much detail , " he says . " That lets me dream a little , and that 's enough vacation for me . " <p> Not far away in a room given over to 17th-century Dutch painters , Tsutomu Daitoku is hard at work on a copy of Jan Vermeer 's The Lacemaker , with its assiduous young lady bending to her delicate handiwork . Tall , thin and earnest-looking , the 25-year-old Japanese amateur taught himself to paint by reading books and studying works in museums . " I came to Paris just so I could copy here at the Louvre , " he says . " I plan to become a professional artist when I return to Japan , moving around the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very difficult , especially the "  --  he consults a Japanese-English pocket dictionary  --  " ' coloring . ' " <p> In order to copy at the Louvre , non-French artists like Daitoku must attach a photocopy of their passport and a recommendation from their embassy or consulate to their application , but otherwise the procedure is the same as for French citizens  --  a simple form specifying the desired starting date and the painting to be copied . No samples of work are requested . Permits are good for three months , and the museum provides each artist with an easel and stool . Except for the requirement that copies be one-fifth smaller or larger than originals and that the artist 's signature can not be reproduced , the Louvre imposes very few rules on copyists , though it further protects against any temptation to produce a forgery by affixing an official stamp to both sides of each copy and carefully inspecting the works before they leave the museum . " But this is not a problem we have here , " says Ferrier . " If someone really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work from a good color photograph in the secrecy of their own studio . " <p> The Louvre is more liberal than , say , Washington 's National Gallery of Art , which has a long list of rules and requires reference letters , original samples of paintings and an interview from applicants . But the Louvre 's Ferrier thinks that " we should leave the artists as free as possible . " One painter who has benefited from this attitude is American Will H.G. Thompson , a slender man of 30 with thick dark hair . A professional artist who won an award for a painting at Paris 's Salon des Beaux-Arts , Thompson was born in Switzerland and grew up in Europe . He studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia and now makes his home in Paris . In a dimly lit room devoted to Spanish classical paintings , he is copying Francisco de Goya 's Young Woman with a Fan , a portrait of a poised young lady with a distant , dreamy gaze . <p> " I got a good foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thompson says . " When I copy a masterpiece , I get a sort of mental trip out of it , applying the paint differently , using light and dark the way the artist did . It 's like taking a lesson from an old master . " <p> Like most Louvre copyists , Thompson often chats with some of the thousands of visitors who enter the museum each day . " There 's a real exchange between the copyists and the public that we consider very positive , " says Ferrier . " Copyists working amid the visitors enhance the way the public sees paintings and incites them to look more closely with a more analytical approach . They start noticing how the artist actually did the work . " <p> Those who frequent the museum have come to know a small man of 77 with pale blue eyes and a gentle manner . Bruno Nini has been copying nearly every day since 1990 , when he retired as matre d ' at a restaurant in Paris 's Austerlitz train station , where he began his days by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working on a copy of Gabrielle d'Estres and One of Her Sisters , a tantalizing portrait of the mistress of Henri IV by an anonymous 16th-century painter of the school of Fontainebleau . <p> " I learned most of my technique from books , " Nini says with obvious pride . " After realizing I wanted to paint , I sought out street artists and tried to get tips from them . Then one day I came here and saw copyists at work . I knew that was what I wanted to do . " Nini estimates he 's done more than 1oo copies , some of which he 's sold ; the others hang on the crowded walls of his Paris apartment . He 's an amateur in the truest sense of the term  --  someone who passionately loves what he 's doing . " Sometimes , when I see the figures in a painting coming to life under my brush strokes , " he says , " tears come to my eyes .
