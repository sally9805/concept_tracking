Chapter TwoExpress . If a Jane Doe was found , Gillian calmly asked me to try to find out if the unidentified body might be her mother 's , never failing to recite the details of her mother 's height and coloring and clothing and jewelry . Was the victim a blue-eyed brunette ? Was the victim wearing a gold ring with three rubies ? If a man was arrested for killing a woman , she wanted me to interview him , to try to find out if he had killed her mother , too . If a suspected serial killer was arrested in another state , she wanted me to try to find out if he had ever been in Las Piernas . I quit the paper once , and went to work for a public relations firm . She tracked me down and called me there  --  O'Connor , my old mentor at the Express , was a soft touch for a missing persons case , and told her where to find me . When I told her that she should ask O'Connor to follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be good for me to remember what it was like to have a real job . I could have refused her , of course , but even at an observer 's distance , I had allowed myself to become too close to the Sayres ' misery over those years . I seldom saw Giles , and never away from his office ; he apparently worked long hours to distract himself from his grief . His mother moved in with the family to help care for the children . Two months after Julia disappeared , Giles told me that he did n't know whether or not to hold a memorial service for her . " I do n't even know what 's involved in having her declared dead , " he said . " My mother says I should wait , that people will think I was happy to be rid of her . Do you think anyone will think that ? " I told him that he should do what he needed to do for his family , and to hell with everybody else . It was advice he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter a great deal to him . Jason got into trouble at home and in school on a regular basis . His grandmother confided to me that his grades had dropped , he had quit playing sports , and had become a loner , having little to do with his old friends . Only Gillian seemed to continue on with her life . She gave her grandmother as much grief as she had given Julia . She dropped out of high school , moved out and got a small apartment on her own , supported herself by working at a boutique on Allen Street  --  Artsy-Fartsy Street , my friend Stuart Angert calls it . And spent four years quietly and persistently reminding the police and the press that someone ought to be looking for her missing mother , her determined stoicism shaming us into doing what little we could . On the day the Kara Lane case first made headlines , Gillian waited for me outside the Wrigley Building , home of the Express . She seemed to me then as she had seemed from the first day I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would meet with disappointment , Gillian simply refused to acknowledge defeat . This affected me more than tears or hysterics . Nothing in her manner changed ; she was often brusque , but she was never weak . Her clothing , hair , and makeup styles might be a little extreme , but her feelings  --  whatever they were  --  were not on display . So I made calls , I followed up . There was never any progress . Until Kara Lane disappeared . By then , I was n't allowed to cover crime stories  --  a result of my marriage to Frank Harriman , a homicide detective . But my marriage is more than worth the hassles it causes me at the Express and Frank at the LPPD . As it happened , Frank was part of the team that investigated the Lane case . I learned details about it that I could n't tell the paper 's crime reporter , let alone Gillian . But before long , almost all of those details became public knowledge . Kara Lane was forty-three , dark-haired , blue-eyed , a divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grocery store at eight o'clock one evening , and when she had not returned by eleven , her daughters became concerned . Too young to drive , they called a neighbor . By midnight , after a search of local store parking lots , the neighbor called Kara 's ex-husband . After another search of the stores , the ex-husband called the police . The search for Kara Lane began in earnest early the next morning . Several factors caused the police to search for her more quickly than they had Julia Sayre : Kara was a diabetic who needed daily insulin injections  --  and she had not taken her medication with her ; she had never before left her daughters alone at night ; and during the morning briefing , Detective Frank Harriman noticed that in height , age , build , and hair color Kara Lane resembled Julia Sayre  --  a woman whose daughter pestered his reporter wife every now and then . He suggested to his partner , Pete Baird , that they take a look at the Las Piernas Airport parking lot . Kara Lane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Julia Sayre 's Mercedes had been left four years earlier . Not long after they called in their discovery , the van was carefully searched . Kara 's left ring finger was found in the glove compartment . At this point , the department called Dr. David Niles , a forensic anthropologist who owned two dogs trained for both search and rescue and cadaver work , and asked him to bring them to the airport . The results were remarkable  --  so remarkable that when Frank and Pete told me about it that evening , I was fairly sure they were exaggerating . " One of his dogs  --  Bingle  --  is so smart , " Pete said . " He can find anything . I mean , he makes these mutts of yours look retarded , Irene . " " Wait just a minute  --  " I said , looking over at Deke , mostly black Lab , and Dunk , mostly shepherd , who were sleeping nearby . " Our dogs are smart , " Frank said , trying to head off an argument , " but Bingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it . And he 's highly trained  --  " " And do n't forget Bool , " Pete said . " His bloodhound . He works with two dogs . If one acts like he 's found something , he gets the other to confirm it . " " Bingle has even located bodies underwater , " Frank said . " How is that possible ? " I asked . " You put him in a little scuba outfit ? " " Very funny , " Pete said . " The dog can do it , " Frank said . " It 's not as miraculous as it sounds . The bacteria in a decomposing body cause it to give off gases . The scent rises through the water , and the dogs smell it when it reaches the surface . They can take Bingle out in a boat and cross the surface of a lake , and he 'll indicate when he smells a body below . " " All right , " I said , " that makes sense . But  --  " " Let us tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tale was that Bingle led a group of men at a fast clip over a weaving trail out of the parking structure and across the grounds of the airport . Then he headed toward an airplane hangar . " He went bananas , " Pete said , moving his hands in rapid dog-paddle fashion . " He was pawing furiously at one of the back walls , " Frank explained . It took the police some time to get a warrant , and to locate the owner of the building , but they gained access . At first , nothing seemed amiss . The hangar was leased by Nicholas Parrish , a quiet man , the owner said ; a man who paid his rent on time , never caused any problems . An airplane mechanic . The police ran Parrish 's name through their computers  --  he had no outstanding warrants . In fact , he had no criminal record at all . David Niles brought out Bool and let the bloodhound sniff an article of Kara Lane 's clothing . Bool , who needed this " pre-scenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical to the one Bingle had followed . Frank suggested getting a crime scene unit to check the hangar with luminol , a chemical capable of detecting minute traces of blood , but the skeptics in the group were starting to grumble , especially Reed Collins and Vince Adams , the detectives in charge of the Lane case . " Collins is starting to make remarks about wasting precious time and his partner is making noise about wild goose chases , " Pete said , " when all of a sudden , Bingle lifts his head and sings . " Pete crooned a single high note that brought both of our dogs to their feet , heads cocked . " David gives another command and the dog takes off again . " This time the dog headed across the Tarmac , to a field beyond the nearest runway . When he stopped , he pranced and bounced around , pawing furiously at the earth , crooning again  --  actions which Pete , getting into his story , performed for us . Quite a workout . David moved ahead , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think he 's found her . " The others soon caught up . They saw the shallow grave , the freshly turned earth , and a woman 's shoe protruding from something shiny and green  --  plastic sheeting . Frank got on the radio , telling the officers in the hangar that they should secure the area , call out a crime scene unit , and put out an APB for Nicholas Parrish . " The whole time he 's on the radio , I 'm moving a little closer , " Pete said , " and I see what the dog was digging at , what he uncovered . It 's her hand  --  you know , the left one , the one that 's missing the finger . " I looked at Frank . " Gillian Sayre will  --  " " You ca n't tell her yet , " he said firmly . " Nobody . Not any of this . Not yet . " But by the next morning the Kara Lane case had made the front page , and Gillian was standing outside the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was within a few feet of her , she held up a creased copy of the Express and pointed to Parrish 's photo . " He 's the one who took my mother . " " It looks as if the cases have a lot in common , " I agreed . " No . I mean , I know he 's the one . He used to live on our street  --  a long time ago . " " What ? How long ago ? " " Before my mom disappeared . " " Have you told the police ? " She shook her head . I was n't surprised . Whatever faith she might have once had in the police had been damaged when the LPPD delayed searching for her mother , and was utterly destroyed when they had failed to find her . Gillian and I shared a dislike of Bob Thompson , the Las Piernas Police Department homicide detective who handled her mother 's case . Once or twice she had talked to other homicide detectives when a Jane Doe was found , but usually she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her behalf . " I thought maybe you could tell your husband , " she said now . " Yes , sure , " I said , still reeling . " Parrish lived there alone ? " " No . I think his sister owned the house . " " You ever see anything strange going on there ? " " No , not really . They were quiet . She moved away  --  do n't remember exactly when . I do n't know where she lives now . She was n't friendly . " " Was he ? " She shrugged . " He kind of kept to himself . I guess he was nice to everybody  --  you know , smiled and waved . But he used to stare at my mom . " Now , as I held fast to the armrests of my seat while the plane jolted in the choppy air above the southern Sierra Nevadas , I watched the killer awaken not far from me . It was not difficult for me to imagine Nicholas Parrish stalking his prey , staring at Julia Sayre as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worked in her garden , or came home from the store . Staring at her , while she imagined herself safe from harm . Staring at her , much in the same way he was staring at me now .
