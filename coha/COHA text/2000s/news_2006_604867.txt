<p> COLLEGE PARK , Md.  --  Brenda Frese arrived as women 's basketball coach at Maryland in 2002 , just after Gary Williams had taken the men 's team to its first NCAA title and shortly before the on-campus Comcast Center opened . <p> When Frese saw the prominently displayed , handsomely appointed trophy case in Comcast to commemorate the men 's title , she had a question for athletics director Debbie Yow . <p> " She asked me if , when the Maryland women won a national championship , they would get similar treatment , " Yow says . " I said , ' Absolutely . Yours is going to be right next to his . ' <p> " It 's her vision . She said that in her first year here . We 're rocking along , but we 're not today what we 're going to become . We 're in the process , but the process is a lot of fun . " <p> The No.6 Terrapins ( 22-2 ) are a program on the rise , off to their best start in 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and then-No.2 Duke ( Jan.8 ) . Maryland is coming off a Thursday road win against previously unbeaten and No.1 North Carolina and gets a chance at revenge tonight on the road against No.2 Duke . <p> " We still have growing up to do , " says Shay Doron , a junior and key member of Frese 's first recruiting class . " But we grew up a lot against Carolina . To pull out a game like that ( down 14 points with 12 minutes left ) shows a maturity , shows how far we 've come in a couple of weeks . " <p> As with other programs that have experienced a rapid turnaround , Maryland has raised a few eyebrows among rival coaches . " Debbie Yow and I have laughed over this , " Frese says , rejecting the notion of any recruiting improprieties . " I have to recognize it for what it is : People get jealous . " <p> The Terps are young  --  97.3% of their scoring and 95.0% of their rebounding come from non-seniors  --  but their offense is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 84.8 points a game ) , with five players averaging double figures , No.4 in field goal percentage ( 48.7% ) and first in rebounding margin ( 14.3 ) . <p> " I definitely love transition and offense , " says Frese , 72-43 at Maryland . " I love to have every player on the floor able to step up and score . I instill a lot of confidence in players so that each and every player has the confidence to step up and play with energy . " <p> These Terps remind Chris Weller , Frese 's predecessor at Maryland for 27 years , of some of her teams that contended for national titles . <p> " I 'm impressed ... they 're all on board with a competitive attitude , " Weller says . " That 's the most important thing . Their talent is great . But talent does n't win ballgames . It has to be a combination of talent and personality , and they have both . " <p> Making the ' connection ' <p> Yow targeted Frese , 35 , when Weller retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In two years at Ball State , Frese went 35-22 for a program that averaged seven wins in the previous nine seasons . She moved to Minnesota , which went 22-8 after going 8-20 the previous season . <p> " There 's a saying in the South : If a dog is going to bite you , he 'll bite you as a pup , ' " says Yow , a former women 's basketball coach at Oral Roberts , Florida and Kentucky . " Brenda , as a pup of a coach there at Ball State , was already jumping up and biting people . She goes to Minnesota and bites a few more . ... It does n't just happen . I felt she had the stuff . " <p> Leaving Minnesota was n't easy . Frese took the team to a 10-game turnaround in conference play , the biggest one-year improvement in Big Ten history , and to the NCAA second round . She became instantly popular in the Twin Cities as the Gophers suddenly attracted five-figure crowds . But the Associated Press coach of the year went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she left abruptly for Maryland . <p> " That was the roughest , " she says . " What most people do n't understand was it was one of the best experiences with that team . I also was going through a divorce . On top of that , I had never in my career had anything negatively written or said about me . ... I had to understand the support there , that we had something special and those people were just being passionate about women 's basketball . " <p> At Maryland , Frese faced another rebuilding job . Weller ( 499-286 ) made the Terps an elite program in the 1970s and ' 80s . She took the Terps to eight Atlantic Coast Conference titles , 12 NCAA bids , two NCAA Final Fours ( 1982 , ' 89 ) and an AIAW Final Four ( 1978 ) in the pre-NCAA era for women . <p> In her last four seasons , however , the Terps went 52-65 , 20-44 in the ACC , where Maryland had had finishes of tied for seventh , seventh , tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland went to one NCAA tournament in Weller 's final five years . <p> Frese went 10-18 in her first season in 2002-03 but hit recruiting pay dirt , landing prep All-Americans Doron and Kalika France ( redshirting this year because of knee tendinitis that could jeopardize her career ) . Doron , who was born in Israel but attended her last two years of high school at Christ the King in Queens , N.Y. , felt a bond with Frese that went beyond their shared love of up-tempo basketball . <p> " When I met Coach B , I felt a connection and the drive to win , " Doron says . " It was a risk ( signing with Maryland ) because they had n't been doing very well . But I did n't want to go to a place where they had already won championships and been to the Final Four recently . I wanted to help build something like that . <p> " I knew this was a recruitable place with a great education available here , a great campus , a great facility and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the coaching staff , I knew it was going to be easy to bring great players to Maryland . I believed in the coaching staff . " <p> Youngsters can do the scoring <p> The blue-chip recruits kept coming , with Frese securing post players the next year . Crystal Langhorne spurned traditional powers Tennessee and Connecticut . Fellow sophomore Laura Harper had reneged on a verbal commitment to Connecticut . <p> The current freshman class includes two prep All-Americans who were wanted everywhere : guard Kristi Toliver and guard-forward Marissa Coleman . The Terps also just landed Tennessee transfer Sa'de Wiley-Gatewood , eligible next season . <p> The players say the secrets to Frese 's recruiting are hard work and building relationships . <p> " She is all about communication , " Doron says . " She creates that environment . You do n't have people feeling intimidated . <p> " She does a great job of creating the atmosphere of , ' My door is always open . What you say stays in this room . ' It 's great . " <p> Frese has assembled a roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it goes back to my ( grade school ) days of 6-on-6 basketball in Iowa , " says Frese , a Cedar Rapids native . She played three years at Arizona before four foot surgeries ended her career . <p> The inside is handled by a sophomore trio : 6-2 Langhorne , who leads the team in scoring ( 16.6 ) and rebounding ( 9.1 ) and was the MVP of the Under-19 World Championships last summer ; 6-4 Harper , who missed most of last season with a ruptured Achilles ' , and 6-1 widebody Jade Perry . <p> Doron , a starter on the Israeli under-21 team , Toliver and Ashleigh Newman , combining for 34.7 points a game , take care of the perimeter . The 6-1 Coleman , who plays every position but center , can score from anywhere . The foursome is shooting a combined 44.0% from three-point range . <p> The Terps are best when Toliver , who missed five games with a stress fracture-like problem in her right shin , is playing the point , freeing Doron to play on the wing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier for Shay to score , " Langhorne says . " When Shay scores more , it makes it a lot easier for everybody else to score . " <p> Arizona and coach Joan Bonvicini got the full treatment in a 92-67 road loss to Maryland in December . Bonvicini complimented the Terps ' inside game , outside game and defense . " The only weakness Maryland has right now , " Bonvicini said , " is that they 're just young . " <p> The Terps are growing up in a hurry . PHOTO , B/W , Jeffrey A. Camarati , AP
