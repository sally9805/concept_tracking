For what did one raise these children ? For what did one labor and heave and suffer reconstructive surgery ; for what did one feed and clothe and coax and school , raising them from sitting to standing to making their own money , if not for their welldeserved gratitude ? It was work , it was a lot of work , even with Filipino maids and International Schools and pull at certain American universities , it was work ! It was donations . It was atriums , reading rooms , auditoriums ; it was handicap ramps and indoor trees and architects who had never been taught when to stop . Did not parents who had sacrificed , who had lunched , who had dealt with schematics and precedents and flow ( how Tina detested flow ) , deserve a child who at least left her cellphone on ? Was it too much to ask ? <p> It was not too much to ask . And yet Tina 's number one daughter , Bobby Koo , age 27 , living alone in New York , far far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building with a doorman , maybe not in a top top neighborhood , but still-thanks to guess who ? - on a very nice block she could have not afforded herself , even working on WaU Street as she did-did not feel she owed it to anyone to keep her cellphone on . Never mind that all sorts of lawyers and bankers and brokers lived in her building ; never mind that every day she had the chance to meet someone nice , maybe very nice , right in the elevator . All the same Bobby was inexplicably unavailable-at first it was sometimes , then it was half the time , and now , all the time . She had misplaced it , she had not recharged it , for all they knew she maybe even kept a second phone , with a secret number known to everyone except her helpless mother in Hong Kong . Was it possible ? It was possible . And how was it that Bobby was always in a meeting when Tina called her office , but not when other people called ? Tina had vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to be a client-but in the end she never had , wanting and not wanting to know . She was ambivalent . Though she did indeed now very definitely , one hundred percent want to know how it was that Bobby 's sisters called and reached her fine . <p> " Luck , " said number three , in Shanghainese . ( This was Brittany the baby , too popular/too skinny . ) <p> " Karma , " said number two , in English . ( That was Betty-married , pregnant , everything right on schedule . ) <p> But what was this " karma " ? Tina knew and yet wondered . She herself had gone to the United States for her M.B.A . and come back sounding okay , not like some people who took words to the United States and brought them back sounding strange . In English especially , her older daughters sounded funny , but somehow they did in Shanghainese , too , and in Mandarin , and probably if Tina understood one word of Cantonese she would find them sounding funny in Cantonese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . <p> " I want you to tell your sister something , " she said now , in Shanghainese . Outside it rained in fine perfect hairs , as if the clouds just had to show they did not have to straighten their hair Korean-style , they were already Korean-style . " I want you to find something out . " <p> But both were suddenly busy over there in the big chairs-Brittany in her own seat with her magazines , and Betty in Bobby 's seat , playing with the new puppy she claimed made her feel less baby sick . When she was not sleeping or throwing up she carried it around in a handbag ; Tina 's husband , Johnson , said he just hoped when the baby came Betty was going to let the amah carry it . Though what if the baby then failed to replace the puppy ? The puppy that was supposed to go xu xu on a paper mat but naturally preferred a certain silk rug . With its wiry fur and coarse doggy features it was n't even that cute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin ! And that super-straight , yes , Koreanstyle hair , no more big curly perms , trying to look like an American movie star . Why did Tina still do that ? Habit . She did wish they would listen to her . But at least today they were ignoring her by the picture window , in the blue light , the mountain and mist like a Screensaver behind them . How vibrant the girls were ! She could hear Johnson as she thought that-Despite these factors , I consider this economy still vibrant . Yet Tina thought " vibrant " the best word for them , anyway . <p> Tina and Johnson had a water view for the dining room , it was like eating on a ship . For sitting , though , they had skylights-that was one thing nice about a mansion-as well as Bobby 's favorite , that picture window facing the mountain , which she said came straight out of a Song Dynasty ink painting , that 's how big it was . Too big , even . So big you had to just bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day in Hawaii , Tina thought she knew what Bobby meant . It was when Tina first saw the mountains being born , the molten lava stealing down to the sea-when she first saw the lava char black on top , like an big burnt snakeskin , molted off by its own burning guts . That halogen core advancing , advancing , then crusting and darkening , only to be streaked by new screaming bright stretch marks-everything oozing , hissing , steaming , puddling down into the cold hard ocean-wow . Tina 's arms were so covered with goose bumps , she had to get back in the car . She made Johnson get back in , too , and she took her pictures with the window up , thinking , What could you do about a thing like that ? Nothing ! <p> Still , you tried . <p> " Listen to me , " begged Tina now . " Have pity on your mother . What am ! going to do . Tell me . What am I going to do ? " <p> " Make offerings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tina drew herself up on her high heels . " Is that how children talk in the United States ? " <p> " They have notably ironical tendencies , " said Betty . <p> " Wait until your baby is born , then you will have a child of your own , " predicted Tina . " And then , well-let me just give you one piece of advice . Do not send it to the United States too early . We sent you too early , that was our mistake . Ironical . " She lifted her chin . " Who knows what ironical means . But ironical children , I can write down for the dictionary what it means . " <p> Betty let the puppy chew on her manicure . <p> " Ironical children : children whose parents do not help them-for example , American parents . Let them find their own financing . " <p> " I do apologize , " said Betty then-thinking , no doubt , of her husband 's new company . She took back her nails . " I admit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid . <p> The next day , no answer again . Outside it rained sideways-typhoon season for real now , where did so much water come from ? It was a level two attack , meaning not so bad you should stay home , but still had to say it was raining . Rat-at-at-at on the skylights , testing the poor seals . Once again Betty admitted-both girls admitted-to having no trouble reaching Bobby ; also to knowing something they could not tell anyone . Proving , Tina told Johnson over dim sum , proving not only that Bobby had some secret system , but that the girls were all three of them against them . Against them ! Their own daughters ! She waved a cart on , then realized-the gau choi gau , the char siu bau-oh well . What happened to filial piety ? she demanded . Johnson looked up from his newspaper , popped a dumpling in his mouth , and shrugged agreeably . And would this be happening if they celebrated Chinese New Year ? she asked . Recently she and Johnson had taken to going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Year 's was just too much work . But sometimes she wondered if that upset their ancestors , even as she wondered , Did she really believe in ancestors ? <p> Johnson looked up again . " New Year 's is not a factor in this problem , " he said , in English . And then , in Mandarin , " Bie kai wan xiao " - do n't be ridiculous . <p> Except for certain expressions , Johnson and Tina generally spoke English , the first reason being that he could barely speak Mandarin-that accent ! - and the second being that he had not learned any more Shanghainese than she had Cantonese , they were both stubborn that way . He hated the Shanghainese hisseverything s-s-s-while who could stand all that Cantonese lohsup-gaw ? So she said , though in fact she might have been less stubborn had she not been expected to understand that men were men for the first thirty years of their marriage . It was only just recently that she had decided , Enough ! Just when he had decided the same thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Too much money . Hong Kong girls were spoiled and dramatic , Mainland girls expected you to help their whole family ; you could not get them an apartment without finding the entire clan living there . He was done . Done ! Tina and Johnson went out to dinner to celebrate , though she honestly did n't know if she believed him or not . Until after dinner , wow-after all these years-who was knocking on her door in his green dot boxers ? The front slit already gapping . Betty called Tina a clone of Tina 's mother , and Tina 's marriage a clone of Tina 's mother 's marriage , too , completely Chinese . But in fact it could be more Chinese . Much more Chinese ! Tina 's parents had fought so much that even at her father 's deathbed , her mother had read the newspaper . Even as his monitors went to zero , a straight line , nothing , she sat there , reading , reading . Later she claimed it was n't a bad marriage , he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the coffin ! Banged and banged and banged on it , distraught , just as if she 'd loved him . Of course there was nothing inside ; the coffin was for show , he had been cremated . Still she banged ; also she died right after him , all of a sudden-everyone said of grief . <p> Now here Tina sat with Johnson , at their favorite dim sum place , at their favorite table by the window . Would she die of grief if he died ? It was true , he agreed , putting down his paper , that the girls were against them , all three of them . It was a conspiracy , he agreed . But then he picked up his cellphone and dialed-checking his messages . Tina watched the rain through the window . She admired the restaurant 's new reception desk ; the owner must be making money . More carts . Everyone , everyone was speaking Cantonese . The cellphone window glowed blue in Johnson 's hand , like a view into another world . It was hard to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hong Kong people did that-came and sat all morning , eating , playing cards , making phone calls . Still . <p> " Johnson , " she said . <p> " Done ! " He flipped his phone shut and winked . Since giving up girls he had gotten pudgier , his wink had too much to do with his cheek . " As we were saying ? " <p> " I 'm worried about Bobby , " said Tina . <p> " Bobby . " Johnson 's frown was also somehow cheeksy-as if something about his cheeks rising up had caused his forehead to buckle . <p> " Bobby , " she repeated . " Our daughter . " <p> Johnson folded his paper . He looked out at the rain . He looked at his watch-avoiding the subject , she knew for sure then , you did not have to be a psychiatrist to know he was avoiding something ! <p> " Bobby Koo , " she said yet again . " Our number one daughter . " <p> " Bobby left her job , " said Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her job . " <p> " Says who ? " <p> " No one . " <p> " Was it Betty ? Betty told you ? " <p> " Let 's just say I have some research opportunities . " <p> " What research opportunities ? " <p> He would not say . A cart stopped , then another one right behind it , with a broken wheel . He picked out chicken feet , duck 's feet-he did love feet . <p> " Did she find something better ? " <p> " No . She just left . " <p> " Left for what ? " <p> He shrugged . <p> " Now I really am going to call her office , " she said , and probably she would have this time , except what was the point anymore ? And at this hour the robot secretary was not going to be there , anyway . <p> Rain . <p> " I read Betty 's e-mail , that 's all , " explained Johnson finally . <p> " How do you know her password ? " <p> He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He looked at his watch . <p> Of course Johnson was not the only one who knew someone else 's password , how else could you know if there was something you needed to know ? <p> " You should thank me that I know so much , " he said , gnawing and chewing . <p> She picked up her chopsticks . The drips on the window cast trickly shadows on her hands , on the tablecloth , on the dishes , everything . <p> " I just want Bobby to come home , " she said . And finally , she could n't help it , she cried . <p> Tina did not actually believe in psychiatrists , Chinese people in general did not believe in psychiatrists , even Chinese people who got their M.B.A . ' s in the United States did not believe in psychiatrists . And yet she had recently gone to one , anyway . Her friend Titi said it was relaxing . She said a friend of hers having trouble with her children had gone to a psychiatrist and that the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home right away . Of course , after hearing that story , Tina wanted to switch psychiatrists , because hers just shook his head when she told him about the letter . Clearly the other psychiatrist was a better value . However , the other psychiatrist had left Hong Kong a long time ago-for Shenzhen , Titi said , where he was now running a factory making some sort of meter-and Tina 's psychiatrist at least listened to her , not like Johnson . The very first session her psychiatrist had said that he could understand why she wanted to cry , that a daughter who turned her cellphone off made a mother feel abandoned . It was one of the ironies of our communication age , he said , that people , being so much more able to keep in touch , were so much more apt to feel abandoned . Because what did it take to stay in touch these days ? Nothing ! How she had cried when he said that . <p> How could this be happening ? Just yesterday Bobby was the smart daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . The daughter they considered practically ( without telling her , of course ) a son . Number one in her class in Hong Kong , got into Andover in the United States with only a little help , just to make sure . And once there , well , Tina did not have to boast , all of their friends knew it : top ten percent of her class , got into MIT all by herself . Interned on Wall Street , got into Harvard Business School , played soccer ; she was all-around and pretty , too , with a high straight nose that had been the envy of her girlfriends in Hong Kong . She was n't one of these girls where you knew why they had to be so smart and all-around besides . If Tina worried about anything , it was about Bobby 's sisters , who were also okay , Tina told them every day how they just needed to find a good husband . And that had seemed to work . Betty was not jealous , despite having gone , not to Andover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , and not to MIT like her sister , but to a very nice college , also in the United States and not as far from the airport as Johnson said , only four or five hours . Betty was not jealous because her husband had gone to MIT like Bobby and in fact knew Bobby there , but would never , ever have asked her out . Bobby was terrifying , he said . <p> As for number three , she was not jealous , either , being too pretty for her own good . Already Brittany had been approached by The Gap to model blue jeans , an agency had pored through her school facebook and called her up . Which small fact Brittany did not tell Tina , in fact she never even told Tina she was going for a test shoot . Tina knew nothing about anything until a friend called from Shanghai , saying guess who she ran into in a Gap store there ? Brittany ! Brittany was going to be happy , you could see it . She was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ math , but then switched to anthropology , as if she just had to show that she could get a Wall Street summer internship even without advanced quantitative skills-which she did , thanks to guess who . And then she had to show that , even having made comments all summer about the rituals of the office , she would be able to return to the company when she graduated from college . As she did , thanks to guess who . <p> Then B-School ; then more trouble . Johnson and Tina had both thought she should go to Kunshan after B-school-close enough to Shanghai that she could have some fun , and talk about vibrant ! With Mainlanders and Taiwanese and Hong Kongers all there , overseas Chinese , too , it was like a reunion . Families that had ended up with one branch in Canada and another in Malaysia or Australia now found themselves not only together again but partners . It was the new Hong Kong . Bobby would have made millions . <p> But instead she had wanted to work for a nonprofit in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had gotten the word wrong . So how about going back to Wall Street ? they had said in the end . And finally , finally , she had gone . But now : Could she really have quit ? <p> Johnson and Tina called Bobby 's office that night and did not even get the robot secretary they knew . Instead there was a new robot , who told them the same exact thing three times , as if they did not speak English : I 'm sorry , Bobby Koo no longer works at this office . <p> " Time to recruit Betty , " said Johnson . " Sit down with her when she calls , and when Bobby answer the phone , quick , get on the line . " <p> So they did , or tried to do , several times . But where Betty had been able to get through before , now she could n't . Her e-mails , too , were bouncing right back . All of which was making her feel so exhausted , she said , she could hardly scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yappy was napping . Nothing under a pseudo-sender . At times like this her face often had the expressionless look of someone putting on makeup-as if she was trying not to gloat . But today Betty just looked tired and worried . She put the sleeping puppy in its handbag and went through her messages again while Tina stood and watched , her feet aching . It was amazing how many times a day Betty heard from her crazy friend , Aspasia . <p> " She 's selling her apartment , " said Betty finally . <p> " She what ? " <p> " You did n't hear it from me . " <p> Tina stared at the computer screen . " Is there a ... " <p> " The drummer , " said Betty . <p> Tina could not sleep . The rain , she said , when Johnson complained . She tossed and turned . She said she wanted to call the police , but what police could they even call ? When they did not know where Bobby had gone . <p> " It 's a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had met the drummer once . He wore a bandanna and stared at you with those blue eyes-stared at everything-as if besides being against laundered shirts and shaving , he was also against the overuse of eyelids . Normal things like holding doors open for people he ignored , but when he noticed a mosquito bite on Bobby 's arm , he scratched it for her , his hairy knuckle jimmying up and down . <p> Suddenly Johnson sat up . " The police in New York , " he said . " We should start with the police in New York . " He reached for his cellphone and began to dial U.S. information , but then had a better idea . " The realtor . " <p> But of course ! They found the listing easily enough on the net , and reached the listing firm , first try . Yes , yes , the seller was indeed alive , said the realtor , or at least so far as she knew ; it was n't her listing . And of course she had the means to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might imagine , confidential . <p> Tina listened to all this on the speakerphone , in the half dark . <p> " Then how about we make offer ? " Johnson asked the phone . " See if she responds . " <p> " Would you like to arrange to see the property first ? " <p> " Not necessary . We just make offer . " <p> " Is this a serious offer ? " said the phone . " I can only present it to her if it is a good faith offer with an appropriate deposit , signaling an intention to buy the property . Should she accept . " <p> " Why should we buy the apartment , we paid for that apartment ! " exploded Johnson . <p> " I 'm sorry ? " said the phone . <p> Outside , more rain ; somehow it always surprised Tina that the rain just kept on raining all night . <p> " And how about the price ? " asked Johnson , after a moment . " Do you feel she is asking high or low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally as upset as Tina . <p> " Priced for quick sale ! " For all his pudginess , Johnson looked drawn . " Okay , this is our strategy . We are going to make offer on the apartment . " <p> " High or low ? " <p> " Low then high , " said Johnson . " As if we are making up our mind how high we can go . Except we 're going to offer until she signs the P &S.; Of course we will find someone else 's name to use . " <p> " And then ? " <p> " And then we go to New York and see her at the closing . " <p> " Ah ! Great idea ! " <p> " Of course , there is some chance she will send a proxy . But I know Bobby , more likely she come herself . " <p> They went back to bed . In the morning , lawyers , offers , faxes . Phone calls ; their good friend , George Hu , agreed to buy the apartment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there was the matter of the co-op board . How lucky that George was on his way to New York , and could meet with them right away ! What with no conditions and a cash offer , they could then just close . Johnson put his assistant to work on the letters of recommendation even as Tina cried to see Bobby 's handwriting at the bottom of the signed P &S.; For an address there was a post office box in New Jersey . <p> A state they had heard of , at least . <p> " Such a beautiful apartment , even before the renovation , " said Tina . <p> " Sold it for nothing , " said Johnson . " Did n't even push back . " <p> The rain . <p> Right there in the sitting room , in what used to be Bobby 's seat , sat Betty now , bigger and bigger every day . Soon they would know girl or boy . How happy ! And yet all Tina could see was Bobby , smaller and smaller in her mind 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar in an old landscape painting , headed down a path to who knew where . <p> Drumming banging raining weeping . <p> New York was dry ! The streets were dry , the buildings were dry , the sky was blue . Birds did not cower under plastic bags and overhangs , but swooped and chased each other up and down like the Hang Sen going crazy . In the middle part of the day you could already feel the oven heat of July ; Tina remembered this from her student days , how June in New York seemed like one month so ready to be another month , you only had to switch two letters to get there . Still , it was cool compared to Hong Kong , and of course Americans did not know what humidity was . Tina remembered , too , from her student days how , other than Wall Street , she had never thought New York impressive ; especially Midtown was not impressive , she could never understand why the buildings were so short when the people were so tall . Buildings should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tiny next to them , the way they were in Chinese landscape paintings . <p> But never mind , Midtown today was blue sky everywhere , a blue you did not see in Hong Kong anymore-too much pollution . And she liked it , this blue . It went with her new running shoes . Tina would not normally wear running shoes with a Chanel suit , even a knockoff . However , she was jet-lagged , and who was there to see anything here ? No one . The sneakers had blue lights that had n't started blinking until after she left the store , Johnson said maybe they had n't blinked when she bought them because of the store carpet . Too thick , he said , not enough bah ! bah ! bah ! , and maybe he was right . Anyway , she had n't realized they would go bibi-bi-bi ! as she passed-much more fun to look at than the bags under her eyes . <p> Johnson had stopped at an ice cream place , and was enjoying a double scoop cone of green tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get that ? You can eat that in Hong Kong , " she said . <p> " Just want to compare , " said Johnson . " see which one is better , ice cream here or in Hong Kong . " <p> He licked . With his head tilted for drip control , his whole face seemed shifted to one side . <p> " No difference in taste , " he announced finally , straightening his head . " Only one is Chinese , and one is American . You know what the real difference is between this ice cream parlor and Hong Kong ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " No red bean flavor here , " he said . " Also no honeydew . No red bean , I can understand . But no honeydew , now that 's a surprise . " <p> Next Johnson spotted a bubble tea place . <p> " You sure you do n't want one ? " he asked . <p> " I ca n't eat . " <p> " I make a prediction . They have honeydew flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admiring her sneakers in the glass door . He emerged with a cappuccino bubble tea . <p> " Did n't they have honeydew ? " <p> " Yes , but I 'm not in the mood . Hey , you know , that 's a Taiwanese shop . The owner is from Taipei . His assistant behind the counter is also from Taipei , but not originally . You know where he is from before Taipei ? " <p> Tina waited . <p> " Brazil . South America . His English is funny . Instead of a Chinese accent he has something else . " <p> " Thank God Bobby is not in South America . " <p> " New Jersey is bad enough , " agreed Johnson . <p> " Are we near Bobby 's apartment ? " <p> Tina had thought herself too tired to walk at all , but now found herself strolling up Madison Avenue , window shopping . <p> " Mr. Koo ! Mrs. Koo ! Good morning ! How 're things in China ? " William the doorman remembered them , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his ruddy temples , as if pointing to his memory . But no , he had n't seen Bobby in a while ; though yes , her unit was under agreement . <p> " Snapped up by somebody like you , from Hong Kong , " he said . " His name is even very similar , if I recall correctly . A Mr. Goo . " <p> Tina and Johnson gazed past William , into the warm-lit lobby with its gilt mirror and striped satin chairs ; and a little later , from across the street , they gazed up at Bobby 's window . <p> " We do n't have to sell . " Johnson 's hand was suddenly in Tina 's . " Even if we do n't use it so often , it will appreciate , anyway . Every day we make money . " <p> Tina nodded ; Johnson 's hand was somehow drier here than it was in Hong Kong , as if tied into the weather . <p> The closing was the next day , in the afternoon-4:00 New York time , 5:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , but not new ; the elevator was slow . Still Tina was shocked , when its doors opened , by the office . The vertical blinds were missing slats , a matted gray path snaked through the worn carpet , and the receptionist barely looked up ; instead of a smile , she offered them a clear view of the white roots of her dyed hair . Happily , the lawyer was friendlier . Len , he said his name was . A short man with a rumpled jacket , a rumpled shirt , and rumpled skin , he looked as if he had just gone through a special machine . Still , he spoke normally enough , and the conference room had a view-no water , no mountains , but you could see very well into the building next door . On the conference room table , the forms were all ready , in piles , with a pen beside each pile . <p> " Folks should be along shortly , " said Len , straightening a pen . <p> And that moment , as predicted , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete , it seemed ; in the back he had buttocks like honeydews , Chinese people did not get like that . And behind the ox , thankfully-Bobby ! It was Bobby ! Only with a blond crew cut and a dog in a bag so like Betty 's dog that for a moment Tina thought it was indeed Betty 's dog . <p> " Bobby ! " <p> Bobby froze . Only her thumb moved , calming her squirming puppy ; she stroked and stroked its head . " Ma ? Da ? " Compared to her platinum hair , Bobby 's eyebrows looked strangely black . She was wearing a short green T-shirt and pants so low that her hip-bones showed . <p> " Bobby ! " Tina wanted to grasp Bobby 's hand , but her daughter 's eyebrows were knit with fury , and her mouth hung open , like her dog 's . <p> " What are you doing here ? " she demanded . <p> " We 're here to buy your apartment , " said Johnson . <p> " What ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stubby hand toward Johnson ; veins crisscrossed its top . " Hi , I 'm Greg , by the way . " <p> " Nice to meet you , Greg , " said Johnson , shaking his hand and handing him a business card . " I am Johnson Koo , here to do some business for Mr. Hu . " <p> " What ? " exclaimed Bobby . <p> " On his behalf , " continued Johnson calmly . In these sorts of situations , somehow , he did not jiggle at all . " This is Mrs. Koo , also here to help Mr. Hu . " <p> " What ? " <p> The dog yapped . <p> " We have his power of attorney , " said Johnson . <p> " You mean you bought this apartment with Uncle George as a front ? " <p> " Shall we sit down ? " suggested Len . <p> No one sat , though outside , on the window ledge , several pigeons roosted . Tina watched the people in the next office building hold a meeting ; someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you call deceit , " said Bobby . " This is- " <p> " I 'm sorry ? " Johnson cupped his ear . <p> " You understand me perfectly well , Dad . " Bobby had the same defiance on her face as she had had as a child-a stubborn anger that came from her father . But what Johnson knew how to use , Bobby spilled out . " Do n't give me that **35;1964;TOOLONG look , you- " <p> " La-di-what ? " said Johnson . He winked at Tina . <p> The dog yapped , pawing the edge of the bag . <p> " We are just come to see how you 're doing , " said Tina . " see if you lost weight , have to eat some more , what happened to your hair ? " <p> " Is that your dog ? " said Johnson . <p> " We just want to know where you are , " said Tina . " If you are alive or not . " <p> " It looks just like Betty 's dog , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bobby . Strangely , she put her fingers to her temples the exact same way her doorman had . <p> " Maybe you did not drink enough , " said Tina . " How about we go out for a cup of tea ? Can I make that suggestion ? " <p> Bobby put her hand in her bag . " No nipping , " she said . <p> " No nipping is right , " said Tina . " We came all the way from Hong Kong to see you . " <p> " That 's crazy , " said Bobby . <p> " You turned your cellphone off . " <p> " It 's stiU crazy . " <p> " Okay , we are crazy . Let 's go out have some tea . Come on . " <p> " What about the closing ? " <p> " Forget about the closing , " said Johnson . " Tell you what . That is still your apartment . Free and clear , all renovated . We give back to you . " <p> " But ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just consider that the apartment is your vacation house . Even if you do n't use it so often , it will appreciate . Every day you make money . " <p> " But ... " <p> " Or you can rent it out . The income is yours , every penny after tax . " <p> Johnson picked up the contract nearest him and ripped it in two . " Time for tea . " A pen rolled out of position ; paper fluttered onto the table and carpet . <p> " Anyway , I ca n't go , " said Bobby . " Unless you happen to know a place that allows dogs . " <p> " Forget it ! Leave the dog here , " said Johnson . <p> " How can I- " <p> " Let me ask you , Len , " said Johnson . " How about instead of legal work , you take care of this dog ? Just for short time . You can charge anything you like . " <p> " That 's very generous , Mr. Koo , but- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . That 's a good deal . " Taking the bag from Bobby , Johnson turned his attention to Greg . " I pay your bill , too . " <p> " Now just one moment , Mr. Koo . " Greg put his hand up commandingly , only to have Johnson hang the bag on it as if it was a hook . <p> " Babysit a couple of hours . Send the bill to me , " said Johnson . " Otherwise we will not leave , just stay here forever , getting louder and louder . " <p> " I 'm so sorry about this , " said Bobby . <p> The lawyers looked at each other . The dog started to climb out the bag ; Greg pushed it back in and swung the bag a little . <p> Johnson ushered Bobby to the elevator . <p> " You have a headache , " said Tina as they waited . <p> " I do . " <p> " You cut your hair . " <p> Bobby looked out the window . <p> " I like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cool in the summer . " <p> " It is . " <p> " Convenient . " <p> Even staring straight ahead , Bobby was vibrant-beautiful and smart , Tina 's number one child . How many herbs Tina took when she was pregnant ! Though probably Bobby would have been just smart , anyway . Tina sighed now and glanced out the window , too-the same meeting as before , the same whiteboard . Probably they were saying the same things . <p> " We were just worried about you , you know , " she said . <p> The elevator dinged and opened . <p> " How do you like my sneakers ? " <p> Bobby looked down . <p> " I did n't know they would blink when I got them , " said Tina . " They did n't blink in the store . " <p> Bobby stepped into the elevator . Thanks to her fashion pants , Tina could see Bobby had a tattoo on her peepee . <p> " Johnson said it was because the carpet was too thick , so I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're you . " Bobby hoisted her pants up a little as the door closed . <p> " Betty has the same dog as you , did you know that ? They are practically twins . " <p> " Well , that 's no coincidence , " said Bobby . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> The elevator descended , descended . <p> " Betty sent me the dog . " <p> " What do you mean , Betty sent you the dog ? " <p> " She called up some sort of special personal shopper . It was a present . " <p> " She never told us . " <p> " It was sweet . However , I do n't exactly have the wherewithal for a dog . " <p> " Now you 'll have to go see her dog , " said Tina . " Get the dogs together . " <p> " That 's an idea , but Zeke and I do n't exactly have the wherewithal ... " <p> " When the baby comes , we 'll send you a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry worry worry about you . Talk about a headache . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Bobby . " I just ... " <p> The door opened onto the sharp daylight of the lobby . <p> " Forget about tea , let 's go get some food , " said Johnson . <p> " Is n't it kind of early ? " said Tina . <p> " If you are hungry , it is not early . It is late ! Let 's go find some Chinese food . see how it compares to Hong Kong . " <p> " It 's not going to be as good as the food in Hong Kong , " said Bobby . <p> " Try , anyway ! " said Johnson . <p> The restaurant boasted a wall-sized illuminated photo of the Hong Kong harbor at night . This cast its image such that the Star ferry seemed to plow across their tablecloth ; Bobby and her parents laughed and looked . Hong Kong side , they said . The Bank of China . Jardine House . Must have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food were not so much like the photo ! - Hong Kong but not Hong Kong . They had noticed that the fish in the tanks were not like the fish in Hong Kong , jumping out of the water ; and sure enough , this fish tasted half dead , as if it had been eating hamburgers . The lobster , too , was strangely chewy , and who had ever seen such shrimpy shrimps ? Plus it was n't only the seafood you did n't really want to eat . An egg white dish that in Hong Kong would have been soft as a cloud was here more like a doormat . Still , they ate , anyway , Tina listening like a psychiatrist as Bobby explained about the group house she and Zeke shared with two other couples . A great thing , she said this was , since Zeke was on the road all the time and they did n't want his thirteen-year-old son , Orion , coming home to an empty house . Which he otherwise would , as Bobby had a great new job as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and she could possibly even take night courses for free , provided she could get away from Orion . Who , well , was still adjusting to not living on a bus the way he used to , that being life as a musician 's kid . Orion said that he liked Bobby , but he also cut holes in her clothes . Every week or so she found another jacket ruined , a shirt . <p> Tina nodded , nodded , nodded . " But you like living with that drummer ? That boy ? " <p> " I like having a family , " she said . <p> Tina made herself nod some more . <p> Happily , Bobby was at least thinking she might eventually want to go back to school . <p> " Not in anthro , " she said . " I 'm done with anthro . But I 'm thinking about mind , brain , and culture-something like that . There 's someone in my department who 's asking , Why do we even have culture ? I might sit in on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Then who knows , maybe I 'll get a degree , " said Bobby . " Zeke says I 'm a ' why ' person , I should be in a ' why ' field . " <p> Tina nodded . <p> " Whereas Wall Street was exactly not about ' why , ' you know ? " <p> Tina nodded , nodded . <p> " That 's a good question , Why , " she said finally . " A very good question . In fact , now that we 're talking about it , maybe I 'm a ' why ' person , too . Because all I can think in these last few weeks is , Why . Why why why . " <p> Bobby looked straight at her , her dark eyebrows looking even darker than before . " I 'm so sorry , " she said . <p> The dishes were cleared ; the table filled again with skyscrapers . <p> " So just tell me now , " Tina said , " is Zeke going to support you through grad school ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , checking messages on his cellphone . " Anything you want to do , you tell us ! " <p> Bobby played with her teacup . <p> " And who cooks , let me ask you . Does Zeke cook when he is home ? " said Tina . <p> " He makes a mean guacamole , " said Bobby . " He puts cumin in it . " <p> " Does he clean ? " <p> " Zeke ? " <p> " Do you have a maid ? " <p> " Mom , this is America . " <p> " No maid ? " Johnson laid his phone down on a cargo ship in shock . <p> " So who is the maid ? " asked Tina . And : " Do you like drumming ? " <p> " It 's loud , " said Bobby . " But I actually love that it 's just a person 's hands , and something from inside , emerging . " <p> Tina nodded . <p> " I mean , you have to just wonder why we are driven to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So I guess I would say I find it beautiful , even if I do n't like it exactly . Do you know what I mean ? " <p> Tina looked at the tablecloth . Outside the restaurant it was still a beautiful afternoon , she knew , but somehow she wished it would rain . <p> " Actually , no , " she said finally . <p> Bobby 's eyebrows went up a little . <p> " Actually , I do n't understand too well what you are talking about , " said Tina . <p> " Of course you understand ! " said Johnson . " Your English is perfect ! " <p> But Bobby spun her teacup around . <p> " Thanks for at least saying that , " she said . <p> Over orange slices Tina and Johnson promised that they would not try to stop Bobby from selling her apartment if she wanted to use the money for school . They also tried to convince her to leave this Zeke and Orion-for was n't the point of America , after all , to be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one slice of orange after another . " Well , I 'm not going to promise anything , " she said . " But to tell you the truth , I was beginning to wonder myself if maybe Zeke and I are n't done in some way . " <p> " Done ! " Johnson beamed . <p> " I 'm not promising anything . " <p> Still Tina nodded some more . " If there 's one thing you know how to do , it is leave , " she said . " It 's your specialty . " <p> Bobby cocked her shorn head , listening . <p> " Just ask your mother . " <p> Bobby laughed and , out on the street , grasped Tina 's hand . How different her hand was now than when she was little-how long her fingers . Tina did miss Bobby 's little damp hand ; her little girl had not walked anywhere , but always skipped . Still they strolled happily now , a mother and a daughter , until a taxi , spewing exhaust , pulled over a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you want this one ? " asked Bobby , and when they said no no no , look at that muffler , she abruptly hugged them . " Well , I 'll take it , then , " she said . " Have a good trip back ! " <p> " Wait , your cell number , " they cried as they ran after her . <p> " I do n't have a cell ! " she yelled back . " Thanks for dinner ! " <p> " And the dog ! Do n't forget your dog ! Your dog ! " <p> But Bobby was waving and the door was slamming even as they shouted . Even as Tina ran-pretty fast , in her new sneakers-the taxi chugged noisily away , disappearing into a cloud of smoke . Tina panted , her pocketbook jounced . " The dog ! " she shouted . " The dog ! " Still the car receded-a yellow dot , then a yellow speck , then nothing . Johnson had her hand ; buildings rose up all around her . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could she do ? Nothing ! That dog , good riddance , was on its own . <p> Author Affiliation
