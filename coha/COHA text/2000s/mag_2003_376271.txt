Return with us to those thrilling days of yesteryear : the ' 80s , when a fedora-topped , whip-cracking , ophidiophobic archaeologist kindled the innocent spirit of antique adventure-movie serials in a generation of kids who had never been to a Saturday matinee . After Raiders of the Lost Ark , Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg are hatching a fourth episode , to star the sexagenarian Harrison Ford . But why wait for that film ? Relive the first three in a spiffy new DVD boxed set from Paramount Home Video . <P> Instead of the familiar track of filmmakers ' comments ( Steven : " That was fun . " George : " Yep . " ) , The Adventures of Indiana Jones offers nearly three hours of shorts , adroitly directed by Laurent Bouzereau , that use interviews and archival footage to detail the contributions of stunt doubles and sound technicians .
