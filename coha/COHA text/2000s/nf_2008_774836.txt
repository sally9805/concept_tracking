Never L o s e Fa i t h // It was a cold day in January 1987 when I said goodbye to Sala . I didn ? t know it at the time-or perhaps I simply wasn ? t ready to accept it-but my friend was dying . // Sala Burton was a Congresswoman from California whom I had known , along with her late husband , Phillip , for many years . She was one of the women I admired most , as well as a close friend . // Everyone respected Sala and knew not to underestimate her . She looked like Mother Earth ; she spoke with a Polish accent ; she didn ? t drive a car . She gave off an intense warmth-if she liked you . She was passionate about what she believed in , but very dispassionate about her // politics . // Sala was like family to me . She loved my children and was especially close to my two oldest daughters , Nancy Corinne and Christine . Nancy Corinne started at Mount Vernon College in Washington shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that she needed // a car . // " Why do you think you should have a car in college ? " my husband , Paul , and I asked . With five children , providing each one with a car in college was not in the budget . " I need a car for Sala , " Nancy Corinne said . " I have to drive Sala around . " // So we sent our old Jeep Wrangler from San Francisco . It was quite a sight to see Nancy Corinne driving the dignified Sala Burton around Washington in a car with removable windows . // A couple of years later , Sala became ill with cancer . We thought she could win any battle . But this was one she could not . // And so the time came to say goodbye . Anyone who has ever visited a friend who is dying will know how hard it is . What was astonishing to me , however , was her selflessness . Despite my protests , what she wanted most to talk about was me. // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered around her bed . Solemnly she announced the sad news : She would not be seeking reelection because she was very ill . She then turned to me and asked me to run for her seat . She wanted me to accept her endorsement // on the spot . // " Sala , please don ? t talk this way , " I said . " You ? re breaking my heart . " // I still held out hope that she would get better . Finally she convinced me that my agreement was the only answer that would bring her comfort , and so , with great sadness , I promised I would run for Congress . // I often look back on that day in wonder . // We all admired Sala ? s strength and grace , but what was striking was the faith she had in me . Sometimes it takes the encouragement of someone who knows us well to propel us forward in ways we never would have dreamed . I was confident in my abilities and accomplishments , but Sala ? s faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up to it . // And so I ran for Congress-and won . I was forty-seven years old , a mother of five , happily married , and never-not even once-thinking or wanting this to happen to me. // In the campaign , I had to face many challenges . Like many women , I was hesitant to talk about myself and my achievements , but I became much more at ease because I believed deeply in everything I said about the issues . // What lifts you up , what helps you to grow , is the excitement of the people around you . When I announced my candidacy in mid-February that year , I walked into the ILWU union hall expecting to see a few friends and reporters ; instead , there was a large , enthusiastic crowd . Their support made me determined to win , not just for myself but for all of them . // Twenty years later , as I was sworn in as the first woman Speaker of the House , faith again was very much on my mind . I thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith that one day we would achieve equality with men . // As I accepted the gavel from Republican Leader John Boehner , I told my colleagues : // " This is an historic moment-for the Congress , and for the women of this country . It is a moment for which we have waited over two hundred years . Never losing faith , we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights . // " But women weren ? t just waiting ; they were working . Never losing faith , we worked to redeem the promise of America , that all men and women are created equal . For our daughters and granddaughters , today we have broken the marble ceiling . . . . // " We have made history , now let us make progress . " // 2 // D e c l a ra t i o n s o f I n d e p e n d e n c e // I ? ll never forget the first time I saw the Capitol . It was on a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . The occasion was my father ? s swearing-in ceremony for his fifth term in Congress . // My brothers were excited . As our car approached the Capitol , they kept saying , " Nancy , look at the Capitol . " I said I didn ? t see any capitals . They insisted , and finally I asked , " Is it a capital A , B , or C ? " As we drove closer , my brother Joey turned my head toward the most amazing sight . // I didn ? t see the giant letters I expected . Instead , I saw a stunning building with a magnificent white dome . I still think it ? s the most beautiful building in the world because of what it represents : the voice of the people . // Whether to view it as the world ? s greatest symbol of democracy , to serve in it as a Representative of the people , or to preside over it as the Speaker of the House , any association with the Capitol is exciting . // To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever I ? m on the floor of the House , imagining what it must have been like for him to be one of the earliest Italian Americans to serve there . My father , Thomas D ? Alesandro Jr. , was a U.S. Congressman from Maryland , // first elected in 1938 as a New Deal Democrat loyal to FDR . He later served as the Mayor of Baltimore for twelve years . My mother , Nancy ( Annunciata in Italian ) Lombardi , so named because she was born on March 25 , the Feast of the Annunciation , was my father ? s teammate // every step of the way . // Both of my parents were raised in Baltimore ? s Little Italy , as was I. My father ? s mother was born in Baltimore-his grandparents were from Venice and Genoa . His father was from Abruzzi. // My mother ? s father was born in Campobasso and her mother in Sicily . They met in Pawtucket , Rhode Island , and raised their family in Baltimore . // It was into this large Italian American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six sons . We were devoutly Catholic , deeply patriotic , proud of our Italian American heritage , and staunchly Democratic . // Those views were shared by our neighbors . Diversity in Little Italy was based on what part of Italy your family was from . Every region and food of Italy was represented in our neighborhood-Genovese , Napolitano , Abruzzese , Veneziano , Romano , Piemontese , Toscano , Siciliano , and more . // Growing up in Little Italy impressed upon me the vitality immigrants bring to America . With their courage , optimism , and determination to make the future better for their families , they fulfill the American dream . They made America stronger . That has been true throughout American history , and it is true today . // My father was twenty-five and already a member of the Maryland State Legislature when he noticed a beautiful nineteen-year-old woman leaving St. Leo ? s Church one Sunday morning . He followed her down the street and , when she stopped at a corner , went up to her and asked for a date . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislator that she didn ? t know who he was and that she would not go out on a date unless her grandmother approved . Hence Daddy ? s courtship of Mommy ? s grandmother . // Apparently he passed inspection because my mother and he were married in a wedding that was a traffic stopping event in Baltimore . All of the members of the Baltimore Police and Fire Departments were invited . // Daddy ? s introduction to government began at the age of eight , when his mother took him to the 1912 Democratic Convention , not far from their home in Little Italy . I can imagine Daddy ? s thrill at hearing the roars coming from inside the Fifth Regiment Armory , where William Jennings Bryan nominated the soon-to-be President Woodrow Wilson , who won the nomination on the forty-sixth ballot . // When he was old enough to vote , my father cast his first vote ever for himself in a successful election to the Maryland House of Delegates . He went from there to the Baltimore City Council and then on to Congress before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural politician , handsome , and charismatic . With his piercing blue eyes , pencil thin moustache , and trademark polka-dot bow ties , he cut a dashing figure . He was a talented dancer and a brilliant orator . Although he did not have much formal education , he was clever and determined . He was very knowledgeable in a number of areas , especially public policy . // Except for his earliest years in politics , my mother was his partner . She was smart , and she had a sense of justice that became a driving force in our family ? s life . I often think she was born fifty years too soon . The truth is that my father and the times held her back . // Now , my father was a wonderful man with an enormous heart , very charming and smart , very loyal , a public servant in the truest sense . While he was forward-thinking and progressive , and appreciated the growing role women were playing in politics , he was bound by the old traditions when it came to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut my long hair when I was a young teenager . // My mother was a wonderful wife and parent , and she was also an entrepreneur and a visionary . She started law school but had to stop when three of her sons had whooping // cough at the same time . She made astute investments , but Daddy would not sign off on them ( which , sadly , would have been necessary at the time ) . She had a patent on the first device to apply steam to the face , which she called Velvex-Beauty by Vapor . It was her brainchild , // and she had customers throughout the United States , but Daddy wanted her close to home . // Despite her frequent clashes of will with Daddy , she loved her marriage , though I think it ? s fair to say she didn ? t recommend marrying young . Whenever she heard that a young woman was getting married , she ? d say , " I don ? t know why she ? s rushing into this . She has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get married so young ? " // Of course , she was thinking back over her own life . She had dreams of her own , and part of what makes me so receptive to new possibilities , I suspect , is knowing that she could not pursue hers . // I learned to assert my independence early . I ? m not saying I was particularly rebellious , but with all of those older brothers , I did have to find ways to hold my own . // One of our family stories involves my brother Joey and me at our father ? s first inauguration as Mayor of Baltimore . We all went to City Hall , and my parents and the three older boys were busy greeting guests . My brothers Hector and Joey and I were ushered into a side room to draw and color until the ceremony began . // We , like all families , had a steadfast rule that the children were never allowed to speak to strangers . When a tall , distinguished gentleman came into the room and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not utter a word in reply . // " Your father is going to be the Mayor . Isn ? t that exciting ? " // he said . // Still not a word from me , but my brothers were saying , // " It ? s all right , we can say hello . " It turned out that the gentleman was Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin , the outgoing Mayor of Baltimore , and we were in his private office . // Joey said to me that he was going to tell Mommy that I was not polite to the Mayor . // " If you do , " I said calmly , " I will tell Mommy that you talked to a stranger . " // I had just turned seven , and Joey was nine . I didn ? t squeal on him , and because I ? d earned his respect , he didn ? t squeal on me. // I had just built my first strategic alliance . //                  @ @ @
