Leigh was only a block and a half from home when she noticed the footsteps echoing her own . At first she did n't think anything of it . This was Kansas . Nothing ever happened here , especially not at five in the morning . Even Dorothy and Toto had to get picked up by a tornado and dropped somewhere else for adventure to come their way . Of course , this was Kansas City , not some backwater town . There was crime in the city . It was also five o'clock in the morning , and she was a lone woman walking down a dark street that -- while a residential area of old houses with families -- was also only a couple of blocks from the downtown core where the homeless and druggies tended to concentrate . A shiver of unease crept up Leigh 's spine as she became aware that the footsteps behind her had picked up speed and were drawing nearer . She 'd walked this route hundreds of times over the last five years and never once felt uncomfortable . . . and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , she tried to recall what she 'd been taught to do in self-defense class , but , of course , now that she needed it , her brain was blanking on her . Was n't that always the way ? She felt her muscles begin to tense as the footsteps continued to draw nearer , and feared if she did n't do something soon , it might be too late . The thought spurred herinto action . Changing direction , Leigh cut toward the curb to cross the street , casting a nonchalant glance back as she did , as if looking for traffic . The look did n't reassure her . The person approaching was a man ; tall , slender , and dressed in dark clothes . She could n't see his face , however ; it was in shadow , thanks to the hood of his jacket . All she 'd managed to do with her quick glance was make herself more uncomfortable , more on edge . More scared . Acting as if she were n't troubled by his presence , Leigh started across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she should do . A glance around the dark house-lined street ahead told her she was on her own , there was n't a car or pedestrian to be seen . No help there . She really should have taken a taxi home , she acknowledged , but had never had a problem before , why should she have thought this morning would be any different ? Besides , it was too late for regrets , they were n't going to get her anywhere . Leigh felt her heart squeeze tight as the footsteps followed her across the street . Now her gaze was sharp as she scanned the houses she passed , searching for any sign of life , trying to deduce which she should approach for help . This was a quiet residential street , the houses in darkness , people having long retired for the night and not yet rising . She appeared to be the only person in this area who worked late and was still up . Coco 's , the restaurant/bar she owned , closed at 3:00 A.M. Well , the bar closed then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar at night . Once the last customer trundled out and the cleaning crew set to work , she retired to her back office to do paperwork ; filling out the work schedules , checking time cards , writing up orders , checking the day 's receipts , and so on . She was usually done about the same time as the cleaners . Otherwise , she waited for them to finish , saw them out , locked up and headed home . . . always between 5:00 and 5:30 A.M. , that dark predawn time when most criminals were tucked in bed . Just as everyone on this road appeared to be , Leigh thought , her heart sinking . Then she spotted a porch light pop on several houses up . A moment later the front door opened and an older lady in a housecoat appeared . The woman did n't notice her coming up the street , her attention on the German shepherd who slipped past her to pad eagerly down the steps onto the front lawn . " Waking me up before dawn . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You should have gone when I took you out for your walk earlier . " Leigh 's heart lifted . A safe port in the storm . She could seek shelter from the woman and call the police , or maybe just a taxi . Surely the dog 's presence would discourage the man following her from making a nuisance of himself ? She put on a burst of speed and opened her mouth to call out , but that was as far as she got . She never heard the man behind her pick up speed , never realized he 'd rushed forward . Suddenly he was there before her , forcing her to an abrupt halt . " Hello , Leigh . " The sound of her name made her pause with confusion , then the man shrugged the hood off his head , revealing his face . " Donny ? " She said with surprise , relief coursing through her . Donny Avries had worked the bar at Coco 's for a year . He was always eager to please and a hard worker . Milly -- Leigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a crush on her and had begged for steady night shifts to be near her , but Leigh thought that was nonsense . They just got along well as friends . She 'd been terribly upset when he 'd gone missing more than a week ago . Usually prompt , and often even early for his shift , Donny simply had n't shown up on Monday night . Leigh had tried calling his apartment , but there 'd been no answer . When he had n't shown up the next night , she 'd called again , then grown concerned and called his landlady to have her check on him . The woman reported that while everything looked fine in his apartment , his cat was obviously hungry and the litter box had been overflowing , suggesting he had n't been home for a while . While there were no signs that he 'd left . . .
