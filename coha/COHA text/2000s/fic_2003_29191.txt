Nick 's office is on seven , the bottom floor of Rocker , Dusha and DeWine , better known to the legal set as RDD . It is the largest law firm in town , with more than three hundred lawyers and offices in four cities . Nick has been here only two years and already he has a corner office and two young associates assigned to him . Like a mini-law firm within a firm . His office has been sharply decorated by Dana , the new Mrs. Rush . Her touch is on everything , from the Persian carpets and artistic earthen vases that adorn the alcoves behind his leather-tufted chair to the gold stud in his right nostril . Nick may have a new sassy-looking wife , but he is the same man I 've known for more than ten years . A cigarette dangles from his lower lip as he talks , dropping ash on the expensive leather blotter of his desk . Nick may not look the part , but people tend to listen to him when he talks . He sweeps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burn mark on the new leather . " If she sees that , she 'll kill me , " he says . He 's talking about Dana . He tongues a little saliva on his finger and tries to fix it . " I have to smoke here . Dana does n't like it at the house . She says it leaves a smell on the furniture and her clothes . I do n't smell it . But then , my smeller 's gone . " He takes a good drag from the cigarette and immediately has a coughing jag . " First one of the day . " He says it between fits of trying to catch his breath , cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth . " She 's right . " He holds the cigarette out looking at it , then puts it back in his mouth . " This shit 'll kill you . That 'll teach me to marry an interior decorator . " He says nothing about thefact that he 's older than his wife by twenty years . He looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That particular bank is closed at the moment . My own practice , Madriani and Hinds , is small , no rival to RDD . My partner Harry Hinds and I staked out a quiet bungalow office lost in the foliage of a courtyard across from the Hotel Del Coronado two years ago . Looking for a cooler climate and a fresh start , we had relocated the practice from Capital City on the financial wings of a large judgment in a civil case . Since then Coronado and the environs around that city have become home for me and my fifteen-year-old daughter , Sarah . Sarah has no mother . Nikki died of cancer several years ago . What takes me to Rocker , Dusha today is a phone call from a friend . Nick is in his fifties . Prime earning years for a trial lawyer . Old enough to have judgment and young enough to do the heavy lifting in court . He considers the move to Rocker , Dusha to have been a good one . I 'm not sure I agree . To look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . The firm recruited him with assurances that they would move him into civil litigation . Instead , he has been buried in white-collar crime . Along with business bankruptcies , it is one of the growth sectors of the law , both areas being driven by the aroma of corporate book-cooking that took place in the last decade . The " me generation " of the 1960s is not faring well . Nick 's corporate criminal skills have been honed over more than two decades , first in the U.S. attorney 's office , then in his own solo practice before coming here . There are rumors that Nick has been recruited elsewhere but has chosen to stay with Rocker , Dusha . I suspect if you chase these rumors down , you will find Nick residing under the rock from which they crept . What the firm wanted was somebody to pick up the respectable businessman who occasionally slips and falls through the cracks , your friendly financial adviser who decides he 'd rather invest you in his new yacht than in the bonds he told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to put in your safe . To Nick , this does n't even qualify as crime . " They were supposed to groom me for the civil side , but as you can see it has n't happened . " He points to the files on the floor lining one wall three feet high . " They ca n't bring filing cabinets in fast enough . We 've generated more revenue in the last two months than any other division . I told ' em I need help . They tell me to work my people harder . If I could bill a fifty-hour day I 'd do it . Chamber of commerce crap , " he calls it . " Consumer fraud . Junior league crime . They should have to give you a plastic ring and a special decoding button before they charge you with any of this shit . I swear , half the stuff in those files I did n't know was illegal until I came to work here . " " Why do n't you leave ? You could probably write your own ticket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to start all over someplace else . Too old for that . I 've got a wife who wants me to wear argyle silk socks to court and sue insurance companies so she can tell her friends over dinner that her husband 's a corporate lawyer and not have to lie . I know you think I 'm out of my mind for being here . Getting divorced , getting remarried . " " I did n't say anything . " " Your silence is deafening , " he says . " I 'm not your therapist . " " I know that . He tells me when I fuck up . " " OK , so maybe I made some stupid moves . Stupid is the word that comes to mind , is n't it ? " He assesses my expression one more time , then adds , " OK , there 's no maybe about it . But it 's done . Over . How do you un-ring a bell ? The personal side of life for me is cooked . But the law practice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is more optimism than I 've seen in Nick in a while , on any front . He 's the kind of lawyer who thrives on a full caseload . " I wish you were my therapist , " he says . " You ought to see this guy . I go to him once a week . It 's like going to the dentist to have my brain drilled without Novocain . I tell him I 'm feeling pretty good , I 'd like to move on with my life . He tells me I need to find closure with Margaret now that the divorce is over . I tell him I got all the closure I needed when her lawyer drove a pike up my ass in the support hearing , you know , the alimony . If that was n't enough , she took every dime I had . I tell him I 've got plenty of closure , I could sell him closure . Then he says , catch this , he says I need to deal with Margaret to get over my feelings of guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tells me I should , that if I do n't I must have problems empathizing . And for this he hits me for a hundred-and-a-half an hour . " " Stop going to see him . " He looks at me through cigarette smoke , gives me a face , something you might see from De Niro . " Then I 'd probably feel guilty , " he says . " My old man used to say pain is good for the soul . I know , that makes as much sense as my joining this fucking firm . But you make your bed and you sleep in it . And if it happens to be next to a twenty-six-year-old woman with an incredible ass , what can I say ? " He laughs . The price Nick pays for lust . He looks at me over the top of his cheeters , half-lenses for reading . He is wearing a three-thousand-dollar suit but has dandruff on his shoulders and cigarette ash on his tie along with a wrinkled tan forehead that ends in baldness he is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow apart . Call it a midlife crisis . Call it a second childhood . Call it what you want . I got an itch . So I scratched it . " This is how he describes a two-week binge in the Caribbean with Dana . And this was n't the first itch for Nick . He took Dana from Nevis to St. Lucia , then down to Belize and back to the Bahamas , half a jump ahead of the investigator Margaret hired to track him down . What Dana told her employer I do n't know . Maybe she took vacation time or figured she had her hook set far enough into Nick that she could quit . The investigator caught up with them in Nassau . All the while Nick was supposed to be at a trial lawyer 's seminar in New Orleans , paid for by the firm . " You ever done it with a twenty-six-year-old ? " he asks me . This comes out of nowhere . " When I was twenty-six . " " No . No . I mean now ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question is rhetorical . I have seen him do this in front of juries for money , lots of it , pleading a client 's case , boring holes through them with those beady little eyes over a smile you know is not being driven by humor . When Nick asks a question like " How can you be sure the sky is n't green ? " he is never looking for an answer . What he wants is the surrender of your rational thought process . Once he has you questioning your own logic , it 's a simple act of illusion before he has you buying into the fable his client is going to spin on the stand . In this case it 's an exercise in absolution by silence from another lawyer . Even if I have n't done it recently with a twenty-six-year-old , Nick can comfort himself with the thought that I would like to . " So Margaret has to go hire herself this prince of darkness , " he says , " some fucking divorce lawyer out of L.A. to stake me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that he is doing so now does n't slow him down . " No . I just pay the tab and figure this is the price of moving on with my life . " If the dark circles under his eyes are an indication , getting on with life would appear to be killing him . Nick 's face is a declining graph of sleep deprivation . Whether he 's working too hard to meet the alimony payments or playing too hard at night with Dana , I ca n't be sure . One or the other , or both , are killing him . " If you had an itch like this , " he says " would n't you scratch it ? Any guy with a normal sex drive . . . " He continues talking as if I 'm not here . Nick suspects I have had my own dalliances , perhaps in a former life before becoming widowed , though I have never shared any of this with him . It 's the reason he calls me from time to time . I 'm cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever I tell him since I have no training in the occult . Being outside the loop of his partnership , I am a safe shoulder to cry on . As he sits across the desk from me , his brown eyes look like they belong behind wire mesh in the dog pound . There are basset hound bags under each . Dana , the new Mrs. Rush , is sleek and blond , four inches taller than Nick . She has the fresh look of a model on her way to becoming a movie star . And unless I have completely lost my judgment of character , she knows how to climb the rungs of life . I have met her three times , and on each occasion she parted with looks that made me wonder if she was n't trying to come on to me . But then , I suspect with Dana most men might foster this illusion , feeding it regularly , in hopes that it might grow into reality . Dana possesses a kind of style that screams TROPHY . Tall and tan with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coals that fire most male egos with a single fleeting glance across a crowded room . And for all you know she might be looking at the clock on the wall behind you , worried that she is late for an appointment to have her nails done . The first time Nick met her was at a political fund-raiser . He left his brains on the table along with the tip and began doing his thinking with his dick . He hired her to decorate his office and the rest is history . He has been on this particular treadmill now for almost two years and is beginning to show serious signs of wear . " You would scratch it . Right ? " " What ? " I look at him . " This itch ? Tell me you would , " he says , " otherwise I 'm gon na start thinking you misplaced your libido . " I give him an expression that is noncommittal . " Fine , then tell me you would n't scratch it . " " She 's your wife , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But if she was n't my wife ? " " I do n't think I have your stamina . " He laughs . " The secret is to pace yourself . " " You 'll have to show me sometime . " " Yeah , well . I admit it can be a problem . " He looks at me . Wrinkles an eyebrow . Wrinkles on wrinkles . " All the same , if you got ta go , what better way ? " It 's the kind of expression you could get from Nick just before he told you what your fee was going to be-and always up front . Nick has made a religion out of tracing the source of his clients ' money to make sure that it will not be confiscated by the government as the fruits of some illicit deal . " She wants me to quit , " he says . This catches my attention and Nick notices . " Not the practice , " he says , " just the heavier criminal stuff . So I 'm getting it from both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . " He grabs a bottle of antacid tablets from the desk , unscrews the cap , pours some into his hand without counting , and slings them into his mouth , chewing and swallowing , then follows it with something in his coffee cup . By the time he swallows and comes up for air , he 's back ragging on Dana . " She 's angry that they have n't come through on their promises . She wants me to talk to Tolt . Press him to get the big civil cases . Like he 's gon na turn these over to me . He hates my ass . " " Why ? " " I do n't know . " " There must be a reason ? " " Hey , you know me . Even-tempered . Easy-goin ' . I get along with everybody . I 'm learning how to climb the corporate rungs . You may not believe it , but I 'm becoming discreet , diplomatic , political , " he says . " Lose your knife in somebody 's back , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tryin ' to learn new tricks and you keep running me down . " " No , I know this dog . He may be calling it a bush but he 's trying to pee on my leg . " " How can you say that ? There 's talk that some of the partners want to put me on the management committee . " " I take it these are some of the partners whose pictures are on the walls out there in reception with brackets around the dates under their names ? " " I 'm serious , " he says . " I know you 're serious . It 's their mental state I 'm worried about . If they 're serious , they 're in the grips of dementia . " " You think so ? " " Nick , putting you on any committee would be an act of anarchy . The only administrative position for which you 're qualified is emperor , and that would only work in hell and then only if there were bars on the windows . " He laughs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the only one standing in the way . From what I hear , half the partners in the firm are ready to walk . " He says it with a little glee as if burning his own place of employment to the ground is his ultimate objective . Nick gets off on blood , especially if it 's somebody else 's . " Do n't say you heard it here , but they 're pissed at him . " He 's talking about Tolt . " Rumor is there will be no year-end bonuses . He wants to plough everything into a new branch office in Chicago . They 're already overextended . That 's what happens when you grow too fast , " he says . " I stay here long enough and Tolt starts doing some creative accounting , I might pick him up as a client . " Nick is having fantasies . Adam Tolt is the firm 's managing partner , for all intents the CEO , Yahweh , the higher power of what is now Nick 's universe . He chairs a management committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who makes the decisions . He is on a dozen corporate boards , two of the companies that make up Dow-Jones . " So what did you tell Dana ? " " I told her I 'm working on it . Have a little patience . Everything comes to those who wait . " " Is that something else your father told you ? " " Read it on some guy 's toe tag at the morgue . He was sitting on the tracks when a train hit him , and all they could find was his foot . " I know the story to be true . Coroner 's bedside manner . " Besides , I 've got a few irons in the fire . " " What ? " " Ca n't talk about them right now . " With Nick , it 's always the big mystery . The next major coup in his life . " Hell , at least with Margaret she did n't care , " he says . " Whatever I wanted to do was fine , as long as we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving her . " " Only once a month , " he says . " When I 'm making the support payment . " Then he thinks for a moment . " No . That 's not true . Sometimes I see her in my dreams , " he tells me . " Coming at me with an ax . " Nick 's laugh at something like this is always the same , a kind of shrill , pitched giggle you would n't expect from a man his size with a barrel chest . It was a bitter divorce . " There 's an old saying , " says Nick , " that the truth shall set you free . I 'm living proof . I told her the truth , and she divorced me . But at least I left her with a song in her heart . " With this he smiles . Nick 's parting was not exactly a class act . It was talk all over town , gossip at all the watering holes . A man possessed of a tongue gilded with enough silver to waltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how to tell his wife he wanted another woman . Even after she caught him with Dana , Margaret was prepared to forgive him . But Nick thought of a way to save her from herself ; with the lyrics to a piece by Paul Simon- " Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover " - playing on an old turntable and a farewell note propped above it on the shelf . Margaret had her revenge in the divorce and the support hearings that followed . Nick is likely to be practicing well into his eighties to pay the bills , though I suspect his annual income before taxes is into seven figures . I can imagine he might now be in a financial pinch . " You 're probably wondering why I asked you to come over . " He cuts to the chase . The hair on the back of my neck goes up . Nick wants a favor . " I want you to understand it is n't me asking ; it 's really Dana . " " That makes it easier to say no , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's the one who suggested I come to you . " Now I am nervous . " She has a friend . This guy sits on the county arts commission with her . Seems he got himself involved in some kind of grand jury probe . " I 'm already shaking my head . " Listen , do n't be negative , " he says . " Hear me out . The guy 's just a witness . He may not even be that . He has n't even been served with a subpoena yet . " " Then why does he need a lawyer ? " " Well , he thinks he will be . I know . And I would n't ask you to do it , except I got a conflict . I ca n't represent him . The man 's in business . " " So is the Colombian cartel . It 's nothing personal , " I tell him . " As far as I know , he 's clean . No criminal history . He 's a local contractor . " Knowing Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing at San Ysidro . Nick would tell a jury his client was drilling for oil , and they 'd probably believe him . " So why would the U.S. attorney want to talk to a local contractor ? " " They got some wild hair up their ass on money laundering . That 's all I know . Probably one of their snitches got into a bad box of cookies . The feds go through this every once in a while . It 's like the cycles of the moon , " he says . " One of their snitches has a bad trip , starts hallucinating , and half a dozen federal agencies go on overtime . From what I gather , it 's the people down in Mexico they 're looking at . " " What people down in Mexico ? " " You can get all the details when you talk to the guy . " " That assumes I 'm going to talk to him . " " Dana 's friend 's name . " He ignores me . " Actually he 's not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently his name was mentioned by another witness in front of the jury . " " How did that happen ? More to the point , how do you know what a witness said in front of a grand jury ? Last time I looked , they lock the door and pull all the blinds inside grand jury rooms . " " Do n't ask me things I ca n't tell you , " he says . " Hell , if I was subpoenaed in front of a grand jury , I 'd probably end up mentioning your name . " " Thanks . " " No . I mean it . If I told ' em ' I went to lunch with my friend Paul , ' the FBI would start sifting through your trash . They do this all the time . They 'll spend two years doing an investigation , dig up your garden , talk to all your friends , tell your boss it 's nothing to worry about , they just want to look in your desk for heroin , and then they stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , all your neighbors drag their kids in the house , draw the drapes , and chain their doors every time you walk by . But that 's life in a democracy , right ? " I 'm still wondering who 's down in Mexico . " Listen . All I 'm asking is that you talk to the guy . It 'll probably just go away . I doubt if they 'll subpoena him . " " They were sifting my garbage a couple of seconds ago . " " Yeah , but you 're not as squeaky clean as this guy . Listen , all he needs is somebody to hold his hand . " " Sounds like a perfect case for you , to turn over a new leaf , " I tell him . " You said he was a businessman . " " I would if I could . But we 've got a conflict . The firm did some work , a civil case against his company a few years ago . You know how it is ? Dana did this big buildup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts commission . She wanted to make a good impression . So when this guy tells her about his legal problems , she says ' I 'll have my husband talk to you . ' Now she ca n't . What do you want me to do ? You want her to lose face ? " Knowing Dana , the guy was probably trying to come on to her . I do n't share this thought with Nick . " She 's trying to make an impression , " he says . " Besides , the man 's a big giver . He digs deep for all the right causes . " " So if he 's into so many good works , why does the grand jury want to talk to this Brother Teresa ? " " It 's probably nothing . " I begin to waffle and Nick can smell it . " You 'd be doing me a huge favor . I 'd owe you my life , " he says . " Well , maybe not that much . " " What you mean is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same thing . " I can already see him edging her toward the sack tonight whispering in her ear about how he took care of her friend , put him in good hands , all the while looking for a little sweet reciprocity . " What 's his name ? This client ? " I got one of his business cards and my pen to make a note . " Gerald Metz . I 'll have him give you a call . " " No drugs , Nick . I do n't do drug cases . You know that . " " I know . It 's not drugs . Trust me . As far as I know , the guy 's clean . His name is being dragged into it because he had one business deal with some people . You know how it is ? " " I know how it is . " I hold up a hand and cut him off before he can start all over again . Chapter two , Rush on civil rights . " Listen to his story , tell him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " What if the grand jury calls him to testify ? Does he understand I ca n't go into the jury room with him ? " " You 're borrowing problems . Hey , if he gets called , you advise him of his rights . Tell him to take the Fifth . " " I thought you said he was clean . " Nick gives me one of his famous smiles . " Why would anybody need a lawyer if they were totally clean ? " Then he laughs . " I 'm only kidding , " he says . " Nick ! " " Listen , I got ta go . I got a client waiting outside . I 'm already late . But we 'll talk , " he says . " I thought you were going to spring for lunch . " " I know , and you said yes . But you said it too easily , " he says . " Next time make it a challenge . " He 's around the desk , his hand on my arm , ushering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on me . I promise . We 'll do it at the club . You have n't seen the club . It comes with the partnership , " he says . " That and a window . " Nick has what he wants : me on the hook . " Dana told him you 'd give him a call to set up an appointment . " " I thought you said he was gon na call me ? " " Did I ? You better call him . He might forget . I told Dana you 'd understand . " I was wrong . Nick has already gotten his treat from Dana . " Listen , I 'm sure this guy 's clean . I mean , my wife does n't run around with felons . " He looks at me over the top of his half-frames . " That 's my job . " He 's got me by the arm now , guiding me toward the side door , the one that leads to the hallway outside instead of reception where he has clients stacked up like planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy ? " " Listen , I got ta tell you a story . " Nick changes the subject . He 's good at that . " A couple of weeks ago , Dana takes me to this exhibit . The guy who gets the blue ribbon . Catch this . His piece of art is a cardboard wall painted dark blue with all this glitter shit on it . It 's covered with condoms , all different colors , glued on like deflated elephant trunks . The artist calls the thing ' Living Fingers . ' I ask Dana what it means . She says she does n't have a clue . " " Maybe it 's in the eye of the beholder , " I tell him . " Something 's in somebody 's eye , " says Nick . " Because later that night this particular Picasso sells for twenty-seven hundred bucks to some old broad wearing a silk cape and a felt fedora with a feather in it . I guess she figures the fingers will come to life when she gets it home . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like art as well as the next guy . " This from a man who in college took art history early in the morning so he could sleep through the slide presentations in the dark . " You did n't answer my question . " " What 's that ? " he says . " How well does Dana know this guy ? " " Who , the guy who did the painting ? " " Gerald Metz , " I say . " Oh , him . She does n't know him at all . They meet once a month . Give him a call . And next week we 'll do lunch , " he says . He looks at me with those big brown eyes , the last thing I see as I find myself standing just across the threshold of his door , watching the walnut paneling as it swooshes closed in my face . Chalk another victory up to Nick Rush .
