<p> The snake arrived shortly before midnight . <p> Christiann Moreno and Alexander Karasik cradled their 5-foot boa constrictor in a blanket . They leaned against each other in the otherwise empty waiting room at San Francisco 's All Animals Emergency Hospital . <p> All Animals is one of just two ERs for pets in the city  --  a place where lives are saved , and sometimes lost , as most people sleep . It is a place where doctors and technicians routinely handle crises large and small . <p> Moreno and Karasik had driven all the way from Pacifica . They said nothing . The snake was hardly moving . <p> In a nearby examining room , Dr. Joe Graff inspected a pit-bull puppy that had arrived a little while earlier . The puppy 's owner , Jewell Kidd , explained that its sister had died the day before in her Bayview yard , and now this one was vomiting and losing weight . <p> " It could be parvo virus , " Graff said as he inspected the puppy 's sharp teeth . " No history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not like a human seizure , " Kidd replied . <p> " We 've got a few options , " Graff said . " The best would be to hospitalize her for the night , put her on antibiotics and fluids . Or you could take her home as an outpatient and we can see . " <p> Kidd was n't sure . " Will it be like $400 or $500 ? " she asked . <p> " It wo n't be that much , " Graff answered . " But it can add up . " <p> In the back room , an assistant told Graff that Kidd in fact had no money . She had promised to pay for any treatment a few days later . <p> Graff thought about that for a moment . " Do the tests , " he decided . " That 's OK . " <p> All Animals was established nearly 30 years ago as one of the country 's first off-hours , emergencies-only pet hospitals . It was the brainchild of 18 San Francisco and Daly City vets who decided that a shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and on weekends . <p> " Profit was n't the motivation , " said Norman Freid , a vet who helped launch All Animals and now sits on the hospital 's steering committee . " At the time , we were n't even sure there would be enough work to keep it solvent . " <p> That soon changed . All Animals , located in the Inner Sunset on Ninth Avenue near Irving Street , now sees about 6,000 patients a year between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. on weeknights and throughout weekends . <p> The hospital charges $49 for an initial emergency exam , with treatment costing extra . The typical bill runs between $150 and $200 . <p> Graff , 45 , has been chief vet at the hospital for the past 12 years . His dark hair is starting to gray , and he has the intense look in his eyes that comes with keeping weird hours . Graff typically pulls three 14-hour shifts a week at All Animals . <p> He dresses in surgical scrubs and freely admits that the adrenaline rush is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part are covered with fur and feathers is beside the point . <p> In any case , Graff enjoys dealing with people almost as much as he likes dealing with animals . <p> " A lot of the people who come in here are anxious and tense , " he said during a break in the action one night this week . " I talk to them and keep them calm . I think I can be of help . " <p> On this night , All Animals had opened for business , as it does most nights , by receiving referrals from daytime vets  --  patients that require further care or observation . <p> In the large cages along the walls were a yellow Labrador puppy receiving fluids through an IV drip to counter vomiting and diarrhea . There was a dog with a lacerated foot , a poodle that had just received an insulin shot for diabetes and a cat that had undergone exploratory surgery for cancer . <p> For the most part , the patients minded their own business , napping intermittently and keeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally , they would be visited by Expo , one of two portly cats that call the hospital home . <p> " Spare parts , " joked Crissy Wentz , a technician  --  vet-speak for nurse  --  at All Animals . Actually , that 's not far off the mark . Wentz said many pet hospitals keep cats on hand as blood donors . Expo and its chum , Thomas , have come through in a pinch a number of times . <p> As with any ER , the staff members at All Animals have plenty of war stories to share . Graff tells of the time a woman with a New Age bent hung a crystal around her ailing dog 's neck before leaving the pooch for a full weekend of care . She insisted that it would help . <p> " The thing finally fell off and broke , " Graff recalled . " The dog passed away a few minutes later . " <p> Most of the other stories are too graphic to be retold  --  tales of abuse or acts of astonishing cruelty and stupidity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abused animals . " But when we suspect it , we call animal control . " <p> Most nights , there 's a stop-and-start rhythm to the hospital , with slow periods punctuated by sudden arrivals . The staff members talk of how the strange hours play havoc on their lives  --  and yet how working in the ER compensates with other rewards . <p> " There are times , " Graff said , " when you can give medication to an animal that 's near death , and then it 's thriving again . When that happens . . . " <p> His words trailed off momentarily , as if interrupted by a particular memory . <p> " Well , " Graff continued , " it feels great . " <p> Karen Smith , another technician at the hospital , left law school to pursue veterinary medicine . She has no regrets . <p> " I wanted to be a lawyer because I wanted to help , " she said . " I wanted to do something that makes a difference . But the more schooling you have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Smith glanced around at the animals in the cages . " This is more about conflict resolution , " she said . <p> It certainly is n't about the money . A tech might pull down only about $30,000 a year despite all the long hours and assorted hazards . An emergency vet , on the other hand , can see annual salaries in the six-figure range . <p> Around 8 p.m. , a massive Great Pyrenees was brought in . Its owner said the dog would n't stop panting and shaking . Wentz drew blood for tests as Smith held the huge hound in a bear hug . <p> The tests ended up negative and Graff concluded that the dog probably just had a fright . <p> About an hour later , a diabetic cat arrived . It was n't responding well to insulin , and Graff recommended that it stay the night for observation . <p> Then there was the German shepherd with a nasty case of diarrhea and the Lhasa apso that had eaten chicken bones . Another dog needed stitches above its eye . An unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The only other ER for animals in San Francisco is Pets Unlimited on Fillmore Street . But Pets Unlimited is more a general-purpose veterinary hospital that happens to stay open around the clock . <p> Freid , the All Animals founder , turns decidedly surly when the subject of his crosstown rival comes up . Pets Unlimited , he said , began as a charity shelter for unwanted animals and then moved into the veterinary-care business . <p> " They 're unfair competition , " Freid said . " They do n't pay a penny in taxes . " <p> This is basically true . As a nonprofit organization , Pets Unlimited is exempt from corporate taxes  --  even though it charges pet owners almost the same rates as All Animals for treatment . <p> Thomas Mason , medical director of Pets Unlimited , acknowledged that such disparities are " a conflict " between commercial and nonprofit endeavors . " But it 's something that 's allowed , " he said . <p> He defended Pets Unlimited 's tax-free status by pointing out that " if there 's a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . Any income we make goes back into the facility . " <p> In any case , it 's kind of hard to be angry at a place that treats nearly 30,000 sick and injured animals every year , including a number of charity cases . Fair competitor or otherwise , at least Pets Unlimited joins All Animals in fighting the good fight . <p> Graff showed that he was n't above bending the rules when he treated the pit-bull puppy for free . After sending the little dog home as an outpatient , he returned to the examining room and called in the snake . <p> Moreno and Karasik released the large , mottled reptile from its blanket . The boa had deep cuts up and down its body , and the bone was visible at the tip of its ragged tail . <p> Moreno explained that she had placed a rat in the snake 's pen as its regular meal and had then gone away for a week . However , the snake did not eat the rat . The rat was slowly eating the snake instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We see this kind of thing with some frequency , " he said calmly . " It 's unpredictable . " <p> The best he could do , Graff continued , would be to give the snake some antibiotics and clean its wounds . He would provide Moreno and Karasik with the phone numbers of some specialists they could contact the next morning . <p> In the back room , Wentz reluctantly held the boa on an examining table as Graff bathed the snake 's skin with Betadyne , a disinfectant . <p> " This is pretty bad , " Wentz said . " They do n't fight off infection well , these guys . " <p> While Graff was clearly displeased with how the snake had received its injuries , he said he was reluctant to criticize its owners . " If I say something to them , maybe next time it gets hurt they wo n't bring their snake in , " he observed . <p> Graff privately gave the boa only about a 30 percent chance of recovering . <p> Around 1 a.m. , Moreno and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundled safely inside a pillowcase . <p> " I think she 'll be OK , " Moreno said hopefully . <p> " I think so , too , " Karasik agreed . <p> Graff wished them well as they carried their friend into the night . <p> E-mail David Lazarus at davidlaz@sfgate.com.
