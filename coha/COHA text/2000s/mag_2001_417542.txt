THE DINING ROOM CHAIR SEATS WERE ORIGINALLY ORANGE VELVET , BUT RE-COVERING THEM IN NATURAL HEMP ADDED A CASUAL YET SOPHISTICATED APPEARANCE . THE NAPKINS ARE BANDANNAS. // PAIRING CHIC , SIMPLE STYLE WITH EARTH-FRIENDLY MATERIALS Editor 's note : Yes , you can be good to yourself-have a beautiful home , a stylish wardrobe , eat great food-and still care about the planet . That 's the premise behind Danny Seos newest book , Conscious Style Home : Eco-Friendly Living for the 21 st Century ( St. Martin 's Press , 2001 ) , excerpted here . A member of the Vegetarian Times Advisory Board , Seo knows what he 's talking about when it comes to conservation : In the early 1990s , he founded Earth 2000 , a youth environmental group . Here , his stylish tips on making a planet-conscious home . In the last decade , buying furniture has evolved from a mind-boggling , timeconsuming experience into a streamlined and fun way to spend the weekend . Gone are the days of snooty stores with overpriced tables , beds and chairs . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture to be delivered . Today we can pick up a table from the showroom and load it into the car . We can even go online and have a sofa delivered in days-custom-covered in the fabric of our choice . But before you go to the mall or antiques store , glance around your house and try to reuse what you already own . You could detach , for example , a mirror from a dresser , paint it white and hang it above the sink in the bathroom . Break up a bedroom set ( they tend to look over-coordinated anyway ) and use the nightstand in the family room or the dresser in the dining room to hold linens and cutlery . When I bought new chairs for my kitchen , I painted the old ones green , distressed them a bit with sandpaper and used them outdoors . But if you come up empty-handed at home and decide to buy a new piece , remember my golden rule about furniture : These purchases should last you a lifetime , so a little planning will pay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best you can afford . Better quality is a better investment and will last . * Good craftsmanship matters . Pull out drawers and examine the joints for tightness . Look for cracks , bubbles or discoloration in wood finishes . Squeeze the arms of upholstered furniture to feel for adequate padding . Look at the stitching carefully and look for frays or overly taut areas . Do n't be afraid to put the piece on its side to examine the bottom . * Even if a piece is an antique , do n't overlook major flaws ; if the wood is rotting in places , it is n't a good buy . Bring a small white towel with you to flea markets or antique stores , then discreetly rub it across the surface of a wood piece to see if any brown smudges come up . If so , the piece may have been covered with shoe polish to temporarily hide damage . It does n't necessarily mean that the piece is bad , but be aware of any defects before you buy . A FACE-LIFT FOR SOFAS I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing it in a few years . Cheap sofas may look good for a year or so , but inexpensive fabric quickly pulls , cushions start to feel uneven , and springs will soon be , well , sprung . A good sofa may have a higher price tag but you 'll be better off down the road . Photograph THESE FLEA-MARKET FOOTSTOOLS WERE BOTH REUPHOLSTERED-THE WHITE ONE WITH ANTIQUE TICKING ; THE OTHER WITH TREETAP , MADE FROM WILD LATEX SAFELY HARVESTED IN THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST . BELOW : THIS SOFA TABLE COST JUST A FEW BUCKS AT A JUNK STORE . // Still , the day will come when kids , cats , guests and life in general will have taken their toll . Fabric will be torn , stains will appear and padding will get compacted . Instead of lugging it to the curb , reupholster it . Reupholsterers can do more than replace the fabric . They can change the shape by removing or adding padding , replace synthetic materials with natural ones , and let you create a new decorating scheme based on what fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like getting a brand-new sofa for half the price . When reupholstering a sofa , there are a few things you need to consider : * You can supply your own fabric  --  useful since many upholsterers do n't carry eco-friendly fabrics like organic cotton or hemp . The upholsterer can tell you how much to order . You can also purchase bolts of vintage or antique fabric . I bought several yards of 1890s French ticking ( it was only $20 a yard ) and reupholstered two flea  --  market footstools with it . * Choose all-cotton padding . Most sofas use synthetic padding in the interior to save money . Ask for 100 percent real cotton ; it wo n't release harmful gasses into your home over time . * Reupholster more than one piece . Have an ottoman or the dining room chairs done in the same fabric . A " group order " should save you money and will help coordinate your home . * Take home any leftover fabric . It can be used to make pillows and tablecloths . NEW WOOD FURNITURE Many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know the piece came directly from a tree that was probably from a dear-cut forest . But there 's no reason to feel guilty ; you can have beautiful wood furniture and still do the right thing . Because if there is one good thing those horrific pictures of clear-cut ancient rain forests have done , it 's boost something called plantation-grown wood . A growing number of businesses now manufacture furniture made from plantation woods-even rare tropical varieties like teak and mahogany-that are n't from forests but from well-managed farms with the sole purpose of raising trees for lumber . When you 're shopping , ask questions . Trained salespeople can tell you the source of the wood and even the glues used to bind the wood veneer . ( Ideally , you want white glue-it 's formaldehyde-free . ) And if they do n't know , the manufacturer can tell you exactly the information you need . Read tags , too . I never would have known some mahogany furniture I loved was actually plantation grown if I had n't stopped to read the bright tag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a significant strategy for reducing carbon dioxide . Scientists have found that the young trees on plantation farms absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than older forests ; so plantation forests help combat the greenhouse effect .

BELOW LEFT : AN OLD DRESSER AND MIRROR RESCUED FROM THE GARAGE WERE PAINTED WITH WHITE ENAMEL AND PUT TO WORK ON THE DECK . // Another alternative is to purchase furniture made from reclaimed timber . Large wood planks rescued from farmhouses , broken tables and abandoned warehouses are sometimes hundreds of years old . The rich color , warmth and charm of this wood makes for perfect furniture . Many companies take naturally aged wood-full of knots , nicks and charming flaws-and remill it into beautiful wood furniture like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is unfinished furniture . By going au naturel , you can use a vegetable-based stain or paint the piece with nontoxic enamel to get the look you want , without adding toxins to the atmosphere . But when you 're doing it yourself , stick to simple bed frames , tables and chairs . Leave more complicated wood items , such as dressers and armoires , to the pros . VINTAGE WOOD FURNITURE When you think of antique wood furniture , most people think of centuries  --  old pieces with sky-high price tags . Think newer and much cheaper . What I call vintage wood ranges from the early 20th century Arts and Crafts movement to utilitarian pieces dating from as late as the 1970s . And vintage means you can own rare woods without feeling bad ; you 're recycling . Vintage wood is also affordable . I found a mission-style desk at a flea market for $50 . It 's not valuable , but its aged finish and exposed construction details have a historical charm . The best places to shop are at flea markets , yard sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of web sites sell vintage pieces-from furniture to lighting-at reasonable prices . And here 's a tip : if the wood furniture has small dents in it , simply place a few layers of cloth over the dent and run a hot iron over it . The heat will make the dents swell back into their original position . And the richness of the wood can be brought to life with a simple vegetable oil polish . ( See " Natural Furniture Polish , " p. 42 . ) UN-HEAVY METAL Metal furniture has a bad reputation . While wood may be described as warm and homey , metal is often described as cold or sterile . Yet there are several reasons to try metal . First , it adds another textural element to the room . Second , it 's durable , timeless in appeal and often very lightweight ( especially aluminum furniture ) . And then there 's my favorite reason : Metal is fully recyclable . Besides , I 've always had a fascination with metal furniture . A simple iron table , free of ornaments or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its thin legs make it look light and airy but strong and substantial at the same time . A stripped-metal filing cabinet doubles as a bedroom nightstand and complements my walnut mission bed . I bought a stainless-steel cart at a restaurant supply store and put a TV on top and the VCR and DVD player on the lower shelves . Now the TV is n't a fixed presence-it can easily be wheeled away . Real office supply stores-not those chain stores , but the retailers that provide desks , chairs and filing cabinets to corporations-are a good place to shop . While it may seem odd to have a metal office desk at home , when you pair it with an antique wood chair , the look works . The juxtaposition makes a **25;811;TOOLONG statement . I hope I 've inspired you-whether it 's to re-do a couch , redecorate an office , rethink metal furniture ... or to do your part to save the planet in the 21st century . Once you 've begun living the Conscious Style life , you 'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A KITCHEN WITHOUT MAKING IT SEEM STERILE . Sidebar Natural Furniture Polish Sidebar Did you know that your salad  --  dressing staples can help keep wood furniture looking well cared for ? Mix 1 cup of olive oil with 2 cup of lemon juice . Whisk until the mixture is emulsified ( meaning the oil and juice no longer separate ) . Pour into a reusable oil spray bottle ( available at gourmet food stores ; it uses air to create a fine mist ) , spray the furniture surface and wipe it clean with a soft cloth . Sidebar Conscious Style Sidebar This new philosophy-which pairs chic , simple style with eco-friendly materials  --  has four main premises . 1 Try to buy things that are made from recycled ( and recyclable ) materials . We all recycle , but recycling is worthless if consumers do n't purchase items made from recycled materials . 2 Sometimes it 's better to pick the stronger option over the recycled , since a product that 's made to last saves natural resources . 3 Aim to use eco-friendly materials in new and exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latex from the rain forest ( brand name , Treetap ) to cover an ottoman ; old bandannas sewn together to make a tablecloth . 4 Never sacrifice style for environmental reasons . While this may sound selfish , it 's not-if you 're not happy with a decorating decision today , you 're likely to change it tomorrow , which uses up even more of our natural resources .
