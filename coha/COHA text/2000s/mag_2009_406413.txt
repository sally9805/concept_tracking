Kenro Izu went to Cambodia to photograph its temples . Then he built a new one  --  dedicated to helping children . How do you turn away from a dying child ? In front of me , in a tiny wheelchair , is a two-year-old boy whose bulging eyes are echoed by his distended stomach , which puffs out the fabric of his thin white shirt like a balloon trying to float away . In the space between his stomach and his eyes where there should be a body , there is instead just the sketch of a frame ; he 's a stick figure come to life , but perhaps not for long . From beneath a blue baseball cap sitting sideways on his head , he stares out at me , unseeing , and although I know I should n't , I stare back , taking in his slow breathing , his stillness . " Malnourishment , " his mother explains from behind the wheelchair when asked what he suffers from ; she is twenty-three but looks thirteen . It is early on a hot morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , in the town of Siem Reap ( population 140,000 ) , in northwestern Cambodia . Already the blades of the five ceiling fans in the small open-air waiting room of the Angkor Hospital for Children ( AHC ) are no match for the heat , yet no one in the crowd of two hundred or so men and women sitting on the plain wooden benches beneath them seems to notice . They have much more on their minds than the weather : their children  --  at their sides , in their laps , tugging at their hands  --  are sick and need help . To look at the majority of them , you would n't know it ; illness can be invisible , and poverty , unfortunately , can be picturesque . Dark-haired and dark-eyed , sometimes dressed in fluffy pajamas bright with images of koala bears or cartoon characters , many are absolutely beautiful as they scamper across the tiled floor or doze in the crook of a father 's skinny arm . But here and there are children in obvious trouble : an eight-year-old boy who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling down ; and nearby , the little boy in the wheelchair , who will perhaps never get up again  --  his mother , who brought him from a village five hours away , may not have gotten him here in time . Fifteen years ago there was another dying child , and another witness . But that observer , unlike this one , did n't take notes  --  he took action . In 1995 , driven by his memory of a little girl in Siem Reap who perished for lack of medical treatment , New York-based photographer Kenro Izu founded Friends Without a Border . Four years later , on a two-acre lot in downtown Siem Reap , the group opened AHC , the first pediatric center ever built in that town or , quite possibly , in northern Cambodia . Today , AHC , still tiny at only fifty beds , provides medical care almost entirely free to every child under fifteen who comes to its facility  --  an average of 350 a day . Almost as impressive , it does so on a relatively small budget , $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During a visit in February to celebrate AHC 's tenth anniversary and to break ground on a new satellite center twenty miles away , the Japanese-born Izu , now sixty but still boyish , is by turns exuberant at , proud of and humbled and shocked by AHC 's success . " This is way beyond what I envisioned , " he says on the eve of events that will be attended by the Cambodian deputy minister of health , the American ambassador and more than 100 supporters from Japan , Australia , Canada and the U.S. , AHC 's biggest donors . " I am just amazed . " I am , too , but not only by the hospital . While doing stories for Town &; Country , I 've observed scenes of extreme deprivation in India , Nepal , Egypt and other places , but usually there were indications close by of a significantly higher standard of living . On this , my first trip here , it does n't take long to register that in Cambodia , where nearly one-third of the population of fifteen million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are relatively few such signs ; almost everyone , especially in the countryside , appears to be destitute or not far from it . If you want a new perspective on the term economic crisis , a visit here will give you one . When we stop by his house , even my private tour guide , twenty-three and very well-educated , with a good command of English and a comparatively high-paying job , turns out to have only two shirts besides the one he is wearing . I have more stuff in my shoulder bag for the day than he has in the small pile of possessions that amount to everything he owns . A few hours later , back at AHC and walking past the small operating room where more than 10,000 surgeries have been performed in the past decade , then touring a nearby ward where 80,000 children have received emergency medical treatment , I feel certain that there are saints in Siem Reap . To see the good that so many people are doing in the midst of so much bad is profound . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reap to encounter the kind of want that makes philanthropy necessary . Five miles north of the town 's honky-tonk center  --  whose half-paved , half-dust streets are lined with ramshackle restaurants and bars  --  lies the reason that two million travelers arrive each year : the main entrance to the Angkor Archaeological Park . The biggest destination in the country by far , it draws Buddha-loving backpackers , retired couples with adventurous streaks and tourists of every type in between . Covering 150 square miles , Angkor is the largest religious archaeological site on earth , with hundreds of monuments and , most notably , about two dozen fortresslike temple compounds where the kings of ancient Khmer ( Cambodia ) worshipped and ruled from roughly 800 to 1400 . Two hundred miles south , the capital of the current day , Phnom Penh ( population one million ) , is home to two monuments of a different kind , terrible testimony to the country 's more recent past . One is Tuol Sleng , the school that served as a prison and torture center in the 1970s , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and professional classes and transform the nation into an ultra-Maoist agrarian society . The other is Tuol Sleng 's gruesome complement , the mass graves at Choeung Ek , just outside the city , where , as at other such places around the country , Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge soldiers finished off their targets . Today these grounds are known worldwide by the name a survivor coined for them , which became the title of the Academy Award-winning movie about the period : The Killing Fields . By contrast , Angkor ( " city " in Khmer ) represents the heights that Cambodian civilization once reached , not the depths to which it fell . War , weather , vandalism , colonialism , tourism  --  all have taken their toll , sometimes heavy , on the immense stone edifices , which are in various states of repair or ruin . And yet the temples ' walls , lined with legend-bearing reliefs so detailed they 're like braille , and their towers , studded own , Angkor Wat ( " city temple " ) , the park 's largest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches of a bygone Khmer culture . But no matter what Angkor 's temples say about Cambodia 's past , it is places like AHC , a modern-day temple , that most effectively convey the country 's present . By the time Pol Pot was overthrown , in 1979 , 1.7 million people  --  one-fifth of the population but especially the educated class  --  had been annihilated ; legions more had fled . In 1975 there were , for instance , about 800 doctors in Cambodia ; by 1979 , fewer than fifty . The infrastructure of the country had been effectively dismantled , and those who remained lacked the resources to rebuild it . The destitution of these survivors , now the parents and grandparents of many of the children who come to AHC , and of their families , is Pol Pot 's legacy . Uneducated peasant farmers , they live , as I saw during several long and short trips into the countryside beyond Siem Reap , in crowded bamboo houses on stilts , with no plumbing or electricity and in close proximity to trash , sewage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor " would be a step up for the majority . Nutritious food , decent hygiene , basic health care , family planning  --  none of these seem a possibility in the near future . And yet AHC embodies the efforts that hundreds of charitable , religious and government agencies around the world , not to mention thousands of individuals , are extending today in the hopes of giving Cambodia 's children a better life than that of their parents . To even make the attempt here  --  or in Haiti or Mozambique or Angola or any other apocalyptically poor place  --  may be one of the great achievements of our civilization . Fittingly , AHC was born of the Angkor temples . In the early 1990s , Izu was in the middle of a decades-long project , traveling the world with a custom-made 200-pound camera and documenting the sacred places of ancient societies : the pyramids , Machu Picchu , Stonehenge and dozens of other monumental man-made structures . As the civil war that followed the Pol Pot regime began to wind down and the government , though still dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a series of trips to Siem Reap . During his second visit to take pictures at Angkor , Izu visited a government-run hospital and saw a seven-year-old girl die as he and her father sat at her side . The same age as his own daughter back in the States , she had been in a coma for three days but had received no medical treatment because the place had little to offer ; the doctors at government facilities seemed to concentrate on their own , better-paying private practices . And besides , her family could n't have afforded it anyway . Though his otherworldly black-and-white images would eventually make him well-known in photography circles , Izu was not a rich man or a famous man or a powerful man . But the instant that the girl died , he became a determined man : he would bring medical treatment to the children of northern Cambodia . He had no knowledge of or experience with or connection to medicine . No ties to any doctors or hospitals . No track record of philanthropy . But he would not turn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe now , but back in the early 1990s I was often the only foreigner in the whole temple complex , " he recalls . " It was me , my guide and the monkeys . But I kept seeing children in the forest there who were missing arms and legs from the land mines left after the Pol Pot era . Then , when the girl died , I thought , ' I know I am just a photographer , but I have to do something . ' " Izu turned to his then wife , his assistant , his agent and other associates , and together they formed Friends Without a Border and spent the next years planning and raising money for what would become AHC . Departing from his usual soft , measured speech , he laughs as he recalls those pre-Web , pre-e-mail days , when he carried a slide projector on trips to Japan and the United States so that he could show potential donors thirty-five images he 'd taken of Angkor 's children . Eventually , in 1996 , he published Light Over Ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angkor , largely unseen since the 1960s , back in the public eye  --  and donated the proceeds to Friends . He did the same with the money he received for selling a master set of the book 's sixty-five fourteen-by-twenty-inch platinum prints to a museum in Japan . Izu has never confirmed the amount of money these gifts represented , and considering his modesty it 's unlikely he ever will , but in sum the value of the works he 's contributed to Friends is probably more than $1 million . And he continues to sell individual prints of all his Angkor photos for the below-market price of $1,550 each , with the full amount going directly to the group ( see " Giving and Going : How to Support AHC , " page 122 ) . Today the hospital inspired by one child 's death has provided care to children on more than 650,000 occasions . At its complex of small buildings , whose number has expanded to six , a staff of 230  --  including twenty-five doctors and ninety-five nurses  --  devotes itself to its young charges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene , AHC 's clients are susceptible to the most common of diseases and ailments : colds that quickly turn into pneumonia , diarrhea that leaves them dehydrated . A dose of antibiotics or a few rehydrating IV treatments , and they 're soon able to return home . But the hospital is also equipped for more-dire situations , with an intensive-care unit in addition to its operating and emergency rooms and significant training in administering HIV/AIDS drugs . Cambodia has the second-highest incidence of HIV in Southeast Asia ( after Thailand ) , and the virus 's transmissibility to children is another cruel fact of life . Among other facilities , there is a dental clinic , which treats about forty children a day ; an eye clinic ; a cooking pavilion , where parents make meals for their children ; and a small garden , where parents are given advice on growing foods with high nutritional value . Treatment does n't end at the hospital , either . Once a child is a patient , a remarkable home-care program allows nurses to follow up in the field in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital . Tagging along with Phao Sovanna , a young nurse , on one such trip an hour into the countryside , I watch as the " rubber road " beneath our SUV turns into dirt , and then the dirt into . . . ruts ? Just finding the house , set in the shade of a bamboo tree on the edge of an as-far-as-you-can-see sweep of rice paddies , is an accomplishment . Then Sovanna gives a malnourished one-year-old girl a thorough checkup and her grandmother two bags of food , along with instructions on how to prepare a porridge that can better sustain the baby . From the meltingly hot landscape around us , almost twenty adults and children materialize to watch and perhaps learn a health-care lesson or two for themselves . Listening later to my description of the scene , Izu nods and smiles . He fends off all accolades that come to him , but he loves hearing praise about the staff , especially now that 98 percent of its members are Cambodians , native workers having made such strides through years of tutelage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the field . An all-Cambodian staff is Izu 's goal , along with an ever-growing community of health-care workers . " We are now the major pediatric teaching hospital in the whole of Cambodia , training about 1,000 doctors and nurses a year , " he says . " They come for a few months , then go back to the countryside , to their small clinics or government hospitals , and they are already better doctors and nurses . " Instead of expanding the current hospital , he 'd rather see its practices and philosophy spread throughout the country . " Even if we had 100 beds , or 1,000 , we would never have enough . The children will always outnumber us . Besides , for a charity hospital , more beds , more patients  --  it means more expenditures and fundraising . What 's important is the people working here , not the fancy equipment  --  the skills , the level of care . If we give Cambodians knowledge , that is what lasts and what can really help . " Like its namesake temples , Angkor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to keep its promise to one in particular . GIVING AND GOING : HOW TO SUPPORT AHC Miracles do n't have to cost a lot . AHC treats more than 115,000 patients a year on an operating budget of only $2 million . To provide children with services at virtually no cost , the hospital relies on the generosity of donors from all over the world . ( It benefits from their ingenuity , too . Once a year a group that calls itself Hairstylists Without a Border  --  ten salon professionals from New York City and Japan  --  visits and gives the staff free haircuts . ) Among the ways you can join in : Donations : Onetime donations of any amount can be made directly to Friends Without a Border , the parent organization of AHC ( 1123 Broadway , Suite 1210 , New York , NY 10010 ; 212-691-0909 ; fwab.org ) . For those who would like a closer association , annual memberships start at $50 . To give would-be donors an idea of a contribution 's value , AHC estimates that a $100 gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pay for a day 's operation of the entire hospital . More examples can be found at fwab.org . Books and Photos : Kenro Izu 's Passage to Angkor ( a follow-up to his original collection of Cambodian images , Light Over Ancient Angkor ) features sixty-seven temple photographs and is available via fwab.org  --  and 100 percent of its $65 purchase price goes directly to Friends . In addition , Izu continues to offer platinum/palladium prints of his Angkor photos at the discounted price of $1,550 , with all proceeds benefiting Friends . Other photography-related items are also available online . Events : Friends holds fundraising dinners and other gatherings throughout the year in various countries , including Japan , Canada , France and the U.S. Its signature event , the Friends of Friends Photography Auction , is held every December in New York City , with many preeminent artists past and present ( or their representatives ) contributing works for sale via live and silent bidding . Recent auctions have included prints , often signed or from limited editions , by Richard Avedon , Walker Evans , Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiroshi Sugimoto , Amy Arbus and Steve McCurry . How to Visit AHC : Opened in late 2008 , AHC 's glass-walled visitors ' center is the first green building in Cambodia . Designed by the New York firm Cook &; Fox Architects , it 's an information desk , art gallery and gift shop all in one . Photographs , a video and other items on display tell the hospital 's story , while the center 's rear wall looks directly across to AHC 's entrance and waiting area  --  where the story begins for patients .

Through the generosity of Australia 's Planet Wheeler Foundation , AHC is building a new pediatric center on the grounds of the Sot Nikum government hospital , twenty miles away .

And in ten years , to become the major teaching institution for doctors and nurses in all of Cambodia  --  that is amazing ! Now my life has meaning . "
