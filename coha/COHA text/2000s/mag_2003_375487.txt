It is clear ... that the court has taken sides in the culture war , " Justice Antonin Scalia wrote last week in his abrasive dissent from the Supreme Court 's decision to decriminalize homosexuality . Excuse me , but what culture war ? Yes , yes , I know that the extremists of the left and right have been bleating about the moral depredations of their opponents for decades ( and raising lots of money off those differences ) . And , yes , I would guess that 72.3% of all yelling that takes place on political talk shows is focused upon " cultural " issues like homosexuality , affirmative action and abortion . But that is show business , not reality . <P> Most Americans are n't extremists , and they are not at war . The lovely paradox of 21st century America is that we seem to be increasingly united by the celebration of our differences . That is what the Supreme Court acknowledged in its decisions on homosexuality and affirmative action last week . <P> " The court legitimized and endorsed a cultural consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law at Yale University . That consensus walks a socially sensible but legally clumsy line between tolerance and outright acceptance . Scalia noted that many Americans might not be comfortable with an openly gay business partner , scoutmaster , schoolteacher or boarder . True enough , but most people would also say that what Tyron Garner and John G. Lawrence did in the privacy of their Texas bedroom is none of our business . The court 's affirmative-action decision was just as pragmatic . Most Americans disapprove of specific , codified racial preferences , like the now famous 20 points granted minority applicants to the University of Michigan . But American life , happily , is no longer plain vanilla . Anything all-white  --  law-school classes , corporate suites or presidential Cabinets  --  is not merely aesthetically displeasing , as Clarence Thomas asserted in his dissenting opinion , it is also considered socially deficient , inappropriate , un-American . Our diversity is the wellspring of American creativity , one of our competitive advantages in a global economy . <P> There is also a consensus on abortion : tolerable during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the rationale for Roe v. Wade  --  the right to privacy  --  was cited in the gay-rights decision . That the court 's controversial abortion decision is now being used as a template for privacy cases is remarkable . It means that Roe is probably settled for the foreseeable future . <P> The political implications of all this are , I suspect , good for both the Republic and George W. Bush . The Republic is always strengthened by a reassertion of sanity . These opinions were written by conservatives appointed to the court by Ronald Reagan . The words they used were striking . Sandra Day O'Connor said diversity is " essential to the dream of one nation " and to the " legitimacy their private lives . " If nothing else , these decisions demonstrate the distance between social reality and the witless intemperance of the current political debate  --  indeed , the gap between reality and politics is one of the reasons Americans find politicians so odious . Which may be why George W. Bush did n't have anything to say about either decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
