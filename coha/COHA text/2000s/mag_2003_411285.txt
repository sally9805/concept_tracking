Most deer camps are shacks or cabins in various stages of disrepair , but they are much more than that . They are also a combination of fraternity house , museum , and time machine that connects the generations of hunters that congregate under their roofs . This one looks as if it might have grown up out of the ground . Shingles in odd shades of brown cover the outside walls like shagbark , and thick paint the color of spruce needles coats the shutters and trim . It has no plumbing , no electricity , no insulation . You can feel the outside air seep through the walls and smell the dirt beneath the floorboards . In a word , it 's ideal  --  or at least none of the nine guys here are complaining . Every fall , they squeeze themselves into this remote camp where they never get comfortable enough to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case is the big woods of New York 's Adirondacks . To get here , each man has driven 200 miles of paved roads and jolted through a 15-mile maze of unmarked logging roads and skidder trails . And for all their trouble , this part of the Adirondacks does n't hold half the number of deer that they could find at home . They make the trip for a reason most of them do n't try to articulate , and some might die before admitting  --  so they can be with each other and , in a way , with all the men who have preceded them . On a November morning at 5 A.M. , Alfred , a retired electrician who has n't missed a date at deer camp in 40-odd years , is loading the woodstove . Big Ken , a 38-year member , is brewing coffee . Mike , a 40-something general contractor who has cooking duties for the week , is frying sausage . One at a time , in their long underwear , the rest of the crew is filing down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the nearest appropriate tree ) , then straight to the woodstove for coffee . Pocket , a Harley-riding welder variously called Dan , Danny , Pocket , Hardware , and Fix-It , is leading the way and , as usual , toting half the gear in a Cabela 's catalog . Next come Big Ken 's sons , Paul and Dave ; then Dickey , Bates , and Mike 's brother Steve . They are light-haired and lanky , and Paul walks as if he was constructed from a box of loose hinges . There 's a short , obligatory debate over who was snoring the loudest and who was stumbling around the kitchen at 3 A.M. After the rundown of who 's hunting where , everybody grabs a rifle and heads for a rendezvous with a deer . The woods here go on and on . They ride the ridges and valleys into the distance and to another time when loggers hauled timber to the river behind draft horses , and the founding members of this camp first paddled in to hunt in 1908 . This is a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cuts , but there have been new cuts for more than a century . By and large , the same beech and maple ridges still overlook the same spruce and pine lowlands . The camp 's parcel of leased paper-company land spans 1,600 acres and abuts more than 3,000 acres of state land . If you get lost and make the mistake of heading north , you 'll have a 30-mile hike to the nearest road . ( No one has ever gotten seriously lost . Hunters understand that if they get turned around , they simply head south until they hit camp . ) But you need only step off the trail to feel you 're in another world . In the silence , the timelessness of this place is palpable . A buck is hit . There 's a difficult tracking job ahead , and the two-way radios are buzzing . The operating principle of the camp is that all work is shared . In no time , every member abandons what he 's doing and pitches in , and no one quits until the 7-pointer is suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's a round of handshakes , then the crew heads inside , where Pocket reaches into a kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle of Jack Daniel 's . ( Every hunter in camp must bring a bottle of booze , not because he has to drink  --  there are guys here who never touch the stuff  --  but because if he kills a deer , he has to buy the drinks for anyone who wants one . ) He plunks it on the counter and announces : " I 'm buying . Who 's in ? " It 's the way these men have shown their gratitude for as long as anyone can remember . After dinner and dishes , the crew retires to the living room and crowds around the woodstove . Here , propped on shelves and hung from exposed studs , is paraphernalia from every decade of the last century : tin sugaring pails , bucksaws , ropes , pulleys , scales , antlers , fish skulls , and , most prominently , photos . In yellowed black-and-white prints , hunters in flared pants and boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooks of their elbows and pose beside rows of bucks hung from the meat pole . In faded Polaroids , recent color prints , and even digital printouts , roughly the same scene repeats itself again and again . It 's a snapshot history of almost 100 years of hunting this land , in which only the rifles and the faces of the hunters change . Alfred , who in his wool pants and suspenders looks as if he might have stepped out of one of the yellowed prints , is pointing to faces in the pictures . " These are the guys who built this camp . They were a group of Rochester professionals  --  lawyers , photographers , and whatnot . Back in 1908 , they paddled in and hunted from canvas tents on the bank of the river just upstream of here . They built that kitchen area in ' 12 , then this room and the upstairs bunk went up in ' 28 . " Alfred takes a seat on his bunk beside the woodstove , slides his boots off , and hitches his thumbs under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this place in ' 68 . Came right through that door , and into the kitchen , where he opened the cupboard , peeled the lid off a container of Tang , and licked the contents clean . Then he walked into the boathouse and bit into a can of lighter fluid . I guess he did n't like that , because he ran right through the boathouse door and headed for the river . " Alfred stands up to light one of the propane lanterns that illuminate the camp . I mention how old the lanterns look , and he says , " Oh no , these are new . We put these up in ' 63 . " He sits back down . " You know in ' 78 we shot one buck for every day of the week . Take a look at that picture right there .... " Outside on the front porch , Big Ken has stepped out with a cup of coffee . He looks past the big white pine to where , under a bright moon , the river cuts a black swath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , the hardwoods seem to sweep over every hill , connecting the distant ridges with the near ones . Big Ken sips his coffee , then looks again toward the woods where he once hunted with his father and now hunts with his sons . " There 's something about this place , " he says . " Ai n't there ? " And if they were here to speak , all the men who have shared this camp over the decades would answer , " Yes , there is . " Illustration <p>
