<p> UAB AT NO. 10 GEORGIA * 1 P.M. * PAY PER VIEW * 750 AM <p> STAFFORD IN CHARGE : ' That boy has got an arm ' <p> Receivers anxious to go deep <p> Just after the first completion of Matthew Stafford 's career came more relief than elation . <p> " He just winked at me , " said Kris Durham , the receiver who caught that pass in the fourth quarter against Western Kentucky . " You could see a little sigh , and then you look at him and you could tell it was time to play . " <p> Since that time , the true freshman has been all business . <p> " He has been back there like a fifth-year senior , " running back Thomas Brown said . " It is like he was bred to be a quarterback . Ever since Day One , he has been big-time . He is always calm and under control . <p> " To see him come in fresh out of high school , be so calm and collected , it is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> " That boy has got an arm , " wide receiver A.J. Bryant said . " He overthrew me in the game . I can get down there , but that boy 's arm is strong , man . " <p> Richt said he would like to see Bryant and Stafford hook up for a couple of those long passes today . They tried it twice last week , but both attempts failed . <p> " Everything is going to fall into place , " Bryant said . <p> This week , everything started to fall into place for Stafford . With more practice snaps , his teammates saw his comfort level rise . <p> " He is talking more , being a lot more vocal with everybody , " Bryant said . " You can seeing him stepping up more and more . " <p> Cox waits for his chance <p> In all the Stafford hype , Joe Cox has been lost but not forgotten . Coach Mark Richt said he hopes to get the redshirt freshman quarterback into today 's game . He has n't said when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation is not a wise thing to do to , " Richt said . " I am not going to pigeon-hole myself or get someone 's hopes up . " <p> Still , the coach apparently remains committed to allowing Cox an opportunity to show what he has in a game . <p> Cox worked two series against Western Kentucky . He led a scoring drive on the first series but threw an interception on a post pattern his next time in . <p> GIM ME 5 <p> Dallas Highland Park coach Randy Allen gives us the top five reasons his former quarterback , Georgia freshman Matthew Stafford , has a chance to go down as one of the greats : <p> 1 . He is coachable . <p> 2 . He throws the ball with great velocity . <p> 3 . He is an accurate passer . <p> 4 . He is a tenacious competitor . <p> 5 . He is a team player . <p> CLEARING SPACE : UAB offensive line presents problems <p> Listen to Georgia coaches this week and you would think the Bulldogs ' defense will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory years . <p> " They are playing against an offensive line that is the most physical offensive line that we have played against since Arkansas , " Bulldogs defensive line coach Rodney Garner said . <p> Arkansas , you might remember , ripped apart Georgia 's defensive line and allowed Darren McFadden to shred the secondary last fall . <p> UAB 's line created enough space for the Blazers to rush for 135 yards against Oklahoma in Week 1 . The Blazers rushed for eight first downs in a 24-17 loss in Norman , Okla . <p> Georgia coaches said all they had to do was turn on that film to get their defensive line ready for the Blazers . And , Garner said , the young guys better pay attention . <p> " The thing that defensive tackle Kade Weston has to improve on is pad-level consistency , especially this week because we are playing against a very , very , very physical offensive line , " Garner said . " So if he plays high , he will be playing about 8 yards deep , flat on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big day today on offense to climb in the NCAA national standings . The Bulldogs are in unfamiliar low territory in several categories : <p> * Passing offense : 81st ( of 119 teams ) <p> * Rushing offense : 42nd <p> * Total offense : 71st <p> * Scoring offense : 31st <p> CA N'T FIND THE HOLES : Question : What can Brown do to UAB ? <p> This was supposed to be Thomas Brown 's breakout year . But so far , the running back has had trouble breaking through tackles . <p> Brown has rushed for 3.7 yards per carry , considerably shy of his 5.1 career average . His longest run has gone for 13 yards . <p> " At times it gets frustrating , " Brown said . <p> But there was improvement from Week 1 ( Western Kentucky ) to Week 2 ( South Carolina ) . <p> " I 'd say he was probably 100 percent better , " running backs coach Tony Ball said . " He was just a lot more patient and disciplined . That was the big difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person is trying to make an arm tackle , you expect them to break those kinds of tackles . We have got to get to where we are making longer runs and bigger runs . " <p> Brown said he 's close to making those type of highlight-reel runs . <p> " Week 1 , I came out there and was trying to do too much , " Brown said . " In Week 2 , I was a lot more patient . I gave myself more time . The main thing was to allow my offensive line time to get on guys and get movement . I 've got to realize that I am moving a lot faster than they move . " <p> PLATOON : Blazers will go with the hot hand at QB <p> UAB has its own set of quarterback issues coming into today 's game . <p> The Blazers have had different starters in the first two games . Senior Chris Williams began the opener against Oklahoma but , because of ineffectiveness , gave way to junior Sam Hunt , who played well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way to Williams , who closed out the 17-12 victory . <p> Hunt , a graduate of Cedartown High , will start today because he 's from Georgia , UAB coach Watson Brown said . But both quarterbacks will see action . <p> " I told them the other day that we do n't have a starter , and that I am going to start who I think should be the starter , " Brown said . " Both Sam and Chris are going to play . ... They 've learned to drop their egos at the door . It is going to take them both to get the job done . " <p> Georgia fans might remember Williams . He was the Blazers ' quarterback when they lost to the Bulldogs 16-13 at Sanford Stadium in 2003 . Filling in for injured starter Darrell Hackney , Williams completed 12 of 21 passes for 97 yards and , more important , helped the Blazers play the game without a turnover . <p> " I have been there , and I know how hard and tough it is to play at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out with a win . Playing in front of all those people in 2003 was actually fun for me , and I am looking forward to experiencing it again . " <p> HARD HITTING : Bulldogs ' defense has pack mentality <p> Danny Verdun Wheeler has two days he likes more than most  --  Tuesdays and Saturdays . <p> That 's when he gets to tackle somebody , which , after all , is what a linebacker is supposed to do . <p> Last season , there was a little less tackling on both days . But too many big runs  --  and one disappointing Sugar Bowl  --  led Georgia coaches to re-evaluate and reinstitute more live tackling in practice and more gang-tackling in games . <p> So far , with only one touchdown scored against Georgia and two goal-line stands by the defense , it appears to have paid off . <p> " Last year , there was just a bad taste in our mouth from West Virginia , " Verdun Wheeler said of the Bulldogs ' 38-35 Sugar Bowl loss . " Our biggest thing this year is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people , the whole team . Get as many people on the ball as possible . " <p> There is no better example of that than a series in last week 's win at South Carolina . Defensive tackle Jeff Owens rushed the passer , missed him , then ran downfield 15 yards and stripped the ball on a scramble . <p> " We knew we had to pick it up intensity-wise , " defensive tackle Ray Gant said . " We felt like we came out flat . Our coaches pretty much challenged us to match the defenses of the past , like that ' 02 defense . People were saying it felt like there were 12 guys on the field . So it was kind of like a pride thing . " <p> " We have done a good job of closing in on those guys by everyone hustling , " coach Mark Richt added . " We made some nice open-field tackles . When you have defensive linemen tackle quarterbacks , receivers , running backs from behind after they run downfield , that shows a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's shutout of South Carolina was Georgia 's second under Mark Richt , whose teams have been among college football 's stingiest since 2001 . The nation 's top scoring defenses since 2001 : <p> Team ... PPG <p> 1 . Miami ... 15.0 <p> 2 . Georgia ... 15.8 <p> 3 ( tie ) . LSU ... 16.0 <p> 4 ( tie ) . Virginia Tech .. 16.0 <p> 5 . Ohio State ... 16.3 <p> BREAK OUT YOUR MOCK DRAFTS : McSwain on radar of most NFL scouts <p> There have been 25 UAB players on NFL rosters the past eight years , most notably wide receiver Roddy White , the Falcons ' first-round pick in 2005 . The next Blazers star looks like defensive end Larry McSwain . <p> The senior from Mobile was chosen the preseason defensive player of the year by Conference USA coaches and is on watch lists for the Lombardi , Nagurski and Ted Hendricks awards and the Lott Trophy . The 6-foot-1 , 255-pounder had 17 sacks and 24 tackles for loss the past two-plus seasons . <p> GIANT KILLER : Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit of putting the scare into BCS powers . In fact , at times the Blazers have made good on their threats : <p> * They won at LSU , 13-10 , in 2000 . <p> * They won at Mississippi State , 27-13 , in 2004 . <p> * They gave Georgia a serious scare in 2003 before falling 16-13 . <p> * They also came out on the wrong end of close calls at Tennessee last year ( 17-14 ) , Pitt in 2002 ( 26-20 ) and Kansas in 2000 ( 23-20 ) . <p> The Blazers opened this season at Oklahoma and led the Sooners 17-14 before Adrian Peterson scored on a 69-yard screen pass at the 3:39 mark of the third quarter en route to a 24-17 Oklahoma win . <p> " All you have to do is look at the highlights of the Oklahoma game to see that they are a heck of a football team , " Georgia coach Mark Richt said . " They took Oklahoma to the limit just as they did to us a couple years ago and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure they 're feeling like they are going to win one of these games that they 've been so close to doing . I just hope it 's not this week . " <p> FLASHBACK : Bennett boots Dogs past Blazers <p> * Last game : Oct. 25 , 2003 in Athens <p> * Score : Georgia 16 , UAB 13 <p> * Star of the game : Senior Billy Bennett kicked three field goals and an extra point to give him 355 career points , passing Kevin Butler ( 353 ) as Georgia 's all-time scorer . <p> * Stats that matter : Georgia 's receivers dropped four passes , including a would-be touchdown to Bryan McClendon in the end zone . Quarterback David Greene threw two interceptions , and Bennett missed a field-goal attempt . <p> * It 's history : UAB 's nine-minute , 45-second touchdown drive in the second quarter was the second-longest against Georgia since such records were kept in 1972 . <p> * Coachspeak : " I 'm sure everyone expected more on the scoreboard . You would think we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia coach Mark Richt <p> * They said it : " I 'm standing on the sidelines , looking up at the scoreboard with a couple minutes left not believing we 're only up by three .
