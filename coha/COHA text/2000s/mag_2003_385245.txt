Piety and intellect TABLE <p> ONLY ONE PORTRAIT of Jonathan Edwards was painted during his lifetime , a rather conventional " likeness " done by the Boston-based painter Joseph Badger . The face is severe , aloof , unsmiling and suspiciously similar to many of the other faces in Badger 's 150 or so portraits from the 1740s and ' 50s . It turned out to be too severe for many of Edwards 's admirers over the years . As a result , later variations on the Badger portrait have appeared , variations that struggle to soften the remoteness of Badger 's image and even to curl the unrelenting edges of Edwards 's mouth into a smile . One of these , an 1877 lithograph by John Ferguson Weir , adorns the jacket of George Marsden 's new Edwards biography . <p> Thereby hangs not one , but two , tales . Marsden has won a distinguished place in American religious history , especially with his landmark history of American fundamentalism published in 1980 . He has also been an effective advocate for evangelicals in higher education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , Marsden detailed the erosion of religious viewpoints from America 's prestigious and elite universities , and argued passionately that secularized universities that pride themselves on diversity have no reason to practice the deliberate exclusion and demonization of religious thinking that openly prevail on their campuses . <p> At the same time Marsden has energetically urged evangelicals not to wait for an evangelical affirmative-action plan but to seriously pursue vocations in higher education , despite the risks and the discouragements . A product himself of the evangelical Protestant subculture , Marsden was one of a group of talented evangelical historians ( including Mark Noll , Harry S. Stout , Nathan Hatch and Joel Carpenter ) who has exhorted evangelical students to do good work , to compete for places in the secular academy and to bury the long associations evangelical Protestantism has had with anti-intellectualism . Knit together by personal as well as professional ties , this group helped organize the Conference on Faith and History and the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals . Their creative studies of American religion forced astonished praise from secular critics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notre Dame ( Marsden ) and highly influential administrative positions at Notre Dame ( Hatch ) and the Pew Charitable Trusts ( Carpenter ) . They preached , they practiced and then they preached some more  --  Noll in his best-selling jeremiad , The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind , and Marsden in his handbook for aspiring evangelical scholars , The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship . <p> The work of Marsden and his colleagues has always had these two aspects : shaming the secular university for its bigotry , and exhorting other evangelicals to give the bigotry no reason for flourishing . If there is one figure these historians refer to , almost as a charm to deflect the bigotry and energize the faithful , it is Jonathan Edwards . In Noll 's catalog of evangelical underperformance , the shining exception is Edwards ; Harry Stout 's impressive work The New England Soul ( on the history of colonial New England preaching genres ) lauds Edwards as the " one towering intellectual figure " among American evangelicals . <p> They have been helped to these claims by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians have felt obliged to include in their syllabi  --  even if it is only to use him as a point of departure before hurrying on to Franklin , Emerson and William James . So when Stout moved to Yale in the 1980s , it surprised no one that his greatest project became the revival of Yale 's intention to publish a scholarly edition of Edwards 's works , a project which had lain virtually moribund since the death of Edwards 's greatest secular remembrancer , Perry Miller , in 1963 . With Stout as its new general editor , the project gained new funding and a new momentum . The Works of Jonathan Edwards now consists of 20 volumes and is the premier scholarly editorial project in American intellectual history . <p> As Stout took over , Noll became a member of the editorial committee , Marsden and Hatch were incorporated into the conferences the committee organized , and the whole endeavor thrived on funding from the Pew Charitable Trusts . Edwards scholarship became the primary showcase for the larger evangelical project : to produce intellectual work which would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to set up a sweeping evangelical paradigm for up-and-coming evangelical scholars to emulate . It is only appropriate , then , that Marsden should have tackled Yale 's biography of Edwards , and that the dust jacket should sport not the Badger portrait , but the lithograph which the Yale Works has long used as its semiofficial image of Edwards . <p> EDWARDS 'S LIFE brackets the first half of the 18th century , from 1703 to 1758 . It was an age of divided minds , home to both Benjamin Franklin and the pietist August Hermann Francke , and Edwards 's life is a study in these divisions . Edwards was educated at Yale , which was supposed to be the firewall that Congregational conservatives were 0 building against the apostasies of Harvard . But he presided over the creation of an evangelical New Divinity which turned out to be as lethal to his ancestral Calvinism as were the Boston liberals he opposed . He was ( just as the Badger portrait implies ) remote , priggish and staggeringly unsympathetic to the inconsistencies and unevenness of normal human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministerial students who came to study in his parsonage were almost sacrilegiously worshipful . He was a Calvinist intellectual , but his most extended philosophical treatise , on The Freedom of the Will , offers a model of human volition that sits suspiciously close to the blank materialist determinism of Thomas Hobbes . <p> Almost none of these complexities and contradictions ruffle the surface of Marsden 's chunky new biography . In the first place , the 18th century is clearly not Marsden 's scholarly element . He has picked up a smattering of 18th-century interpretive vocabulary-the significance of hierarchy from Gordon Wood , the economic pressures plaguing Northampton from Patricia Tracy , the entangling web of kinship networks from Kenneth Minkema 's marvelous dissertation on the Edwards family-but a careful survey of the footnotes does not reveal much reading beyond a fairly small shelf of secondary sources and , of course , the published texts of the Yale Edwards volumes . <p> That means that a variety of key manuscript sources for Edwards 's life ( such as the journal Samuel Hopkins kept during his sojourn with the Edwards family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presbyterian Historical Society ) never make an appearance . Judging just from the notes , the Minkema dissertation is the backbone of this book , with George Claghorn 's edition of Edwards 's Letters and Personal Writings ( volume 16 in the Yale series ) coming in a close second . <p> In the introduction Marsden promises " to tell the story of Edwards and his family with relatively few interpretive intrusions . " This is a refreshing promise after a decade of postmodern biographies into which authors feel free to insert loopy personal fantasies and political self-congratulation . But those " few intrusions " are enormous , in terms of both substance and style . Substantively , the " largest theme " of this book is how " a religion that claims universal and exclusive truth " can fit " into a pluralistic environment . " This is , of course , the theme that dominates The Soul of the American University and The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship , and it suggests that the biography 's focus is not the Edwards of the 18th century but the evangelicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marker for them . <p> Stylistically , there is a breathlessness in Marsden 's estimates of Edwards that hints at trumpets and angel-choirs in the background . Edwards is fascinated " by the eternally momentous question of conversion " ; his youthful self-examinations for the signs of grace were " honing a character of steel " ; he is " working in similar worlds of discourse " as J. S. Bach ; his preaching is " awe-inspiring " ; his savage dismissal by his Northampton congregation in 1750 was caused by " his commitment to principle " ; his " universe was similar to that of many of our own moral tales , from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings to countless lesser entertainments . " ( I am trying to imagine Solomon Stoddard as Gandalf or George Whitefield as a kind of Obi-wan Kenobi , but I just ca n't . ) <p> A more subtle kind of interpretive intrusion comes when Marsden lapses into traces of modern evangelicalese  --  the vocabulary of " the last days " or portentous declarations that " the fires of the Holy Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spreading from one to another . " And there is more than a little special evangelical pleading in those intrusions . The uneasiness with which modern readers react to Edwards 's most famous sermon , " Sinners in the Hands of Angry God , " only shows for Marsden " how immense the gulf of assumptions is that separates most modern readers from the world " of the 18th century . <p> Fair enough , but then what is it about 18th-century people that makes " Sinners " so much more palatable to them than to modern readers ? Marsden insists that that 's not the right question . The problem is with us : " Few today , including many who affirm traditional Christian doctrines , have the sympathies to take seriously some of the deepest sensibilities " of those " ordinary 18th-century colonials . " Once again , the focus is on modern incomprehension of evangelical uprightness , not on Edwards . <p> THE PAUCITY of primary research in Marsden 's book guarantees that there will be little in the way of new discoveries here . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same path as Ola Elizabeth Winslow 's Jonathan Edwards ( 1940 ) and lain Murray 's Jonathan Edwards : A New Biography ( 1986 ) , or else repackages the research of Minkema and other Edwards scholars . Like Perry Miller ( Jonathan Edwards1949 ) , Marsden would like to imply that Edwards was a victim of the " transition from yeoman society to agrarian capitalism . " But Miller wrote long before early American historians embraced " bottom-up " social history and turned to tax lists and probate inventories as sources for piecing together the world of colonial American . That social history from western Massachusetts in the 1750s shows very little evidence of anything that looks like serious enmeshment in transatlantic capitalist networks . That enmeshment would not begin in western Massachusetts until the 1820s , and Edwards himself thought that one reason for the comparative immunity of the Connecticut River valley from incursions of " Arminianism " was its remoteness from the coastal commercial towns . <p> It was not capitalism but Pietism which came the closest to enmeshing Edwards in transatlantic networks of discourse . Edwards scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narrative of 1735 ( the first publication which brought him international attention ) , used as his case studies in spiritual awakening a young woman , Abigail Hutchinson , and a four-year-old girl , Phoebe Bartlett . These were not the models most likely to persuade elite skeptics in a society as committed to hierarchy as Marsden portrays it . It is only when Hutchinson and Bartlett are placed against the template of conversion models in contemporaneous Pietist literature ( such as the Silesian children 's revival described in W. G. Ward 's The Protestant Evangelical Awakening ) that Edwards 's use of Hutchinson and Bartlett suddenly becomes part of a recognizable pattern . Yet Hutchinson and Bartlett get only one passing mention from Marsden , and Pietism disappears after a one-paragraph cameo appearance . <p> Still , I may be asking for attention to the trees when Marsden is after the forest . And the forest in this case is the idea that true evangelical faith and the highest flights of intellectual power , far from competing , are mutually energizing . Edwards 's " theological assessments "  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a rare " prescience " of the " direction that Western thought , culture , and religion were heading . " His " rigorous Calvinism " equips him with a timeless and totalizing capacity " to critically scrutinize his own era " and use " many of its categories and assumptions ... to criticize its trends . " Marsden 's Edwards , in other words , contains the same twofold endeavor which has dominated Marsden 's imagination from the start-to show how good history can be done by evangelicals , and how the study of evangelicals can yield good history . <p> It would , I think , be safe to say that Marsden has written a life of Edwards the way Edwards would have liked such a life to be written . Edwards himself wrote such a biography about the tubercular missionary David Brainerd , whose journals Edwards rewrote and published in 1749 as An Account of the Life of the Late Reverend Mr. David Brainerd . Edwards presented Brainerd 's sacrificial mission to the Indians as the model of true evangelical piety . He made no great effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatises for comparison , and with a show of evenhandedness he acknowledged that Brainerd was not perfect , either in thought or deed . Nevertheless , Brainerd was , according to Edwards , " indeed a remarkable instance of true and eminent Christian piety in heart and practice . " When we hear Marsden conclude that " Edwards , despite some evident shortcomings , was a saint according to the highest Reformed spiritual standards , " we are not far from hearing what Edwards said of Brainerd . But this kind of assessment belongs to the lives-of-the-saints genre , not to history . <p> Can there be a biography of Edwards which avoids both the urge to make him into a preaching puppet and the tin-eared incredulity of the secular modems Marsden criticizes ? I think so , but this is not it . Like Miller 's Jonathan Edwards , which was less a biography and more of a tract for neo-orthodox times , Marsden 's Edwards will be remembered less as a biography and more as a period piece from the " evangelical surge " in American academic culture chronicled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also motivate the up-and-coming evangelicals Marsden has struggled to cultivate and encourage finally to write the Life that Edwards so richly deserves .
