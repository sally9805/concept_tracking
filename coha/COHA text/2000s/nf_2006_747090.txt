A narrative study was conducted to investigate how seven female Chinese international students negotiate their identities . Data were collected mainly via taped individual interviews . This study found that most of the participants experienced what they perceived to be constraints on their identities imposed by the American ideology of cultural homogeneity . Although the participants strive to negotiate their identities , because they depend mainly on internal and unobtrusive processes to construct their subjects of identities , their identity negotiation is often overlooked , leading to the assumption that such students are objects of their identities . Therefore , this study took a unique viewpoint that describes the identity negotiation from their perspectives . <p> A qualitative study was conducted to investigate this research question : How do female Chinese international students negotiate their identities in a second-language higher education setting ? In this paper , I first address the background and problem of this study . After addressing the conceptual framework and the data collection and analysis , I discuss the findings and contributions of this study and have suggestions for international students , college educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Study <p> Despite the general perception that American culture is characterized more by diversity than by homogeneity , the American ideology of cultural homogeneity implies an American mindset that because the English language and Eurocentric culture are superior to others , people with different cultures and languages should conform to the dominant monocultural canon and norms . This ideology essentially reveals that because Eurocentric culture is representative of the dominant culture in American society , American society values the knowledge and cultures of the dominant group as the model for other cultures and languages and attributes to those who are unable or unwilling to fit the dominant culture a deficient identity . The American ideology of cultural homogeneity , typical of a monolingual society ( e.g. , Blackledge &; Pavlenko , 2001 , 2004 ; Crawford , 2000 ) , is the mentality that English is the only language that counts and language diversity is a problem rather than a resource ( Wiley , 1997 ; Nieto , 2000 ) . Therefore , using the example of the English Only Movement , Crawford points out that the American ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of diversity of cultures and languages . By " accentuating people 's qualification deficiencies , " the American ideology of cultural homogeneity " saddles individuals with a deficiency identity " ( Blackledge &; Pavlenko , 2001 , p. 339 ) and potentially excludes and discriminates against " those who are either unable or unwilling to fit the norm " ( Blackledge &; Pavlenko , p. 243 ) . Therefore , this ideology is " a social integration policy based on ' objectively necessary ' formal qualifications " ( Jansen &; Wildemeersch , 1996 , p. 333 ) . Because American society is characterized by the American ideology of cultural homogeneity , ethnic and racial minority students are evaluated according to the dominant norms and are expected to " learn to operate successfully in the dominant-white-system " ( Yeh &; Drost , 2002 ; The role of the dominant culture in schools ) . If they fail to fit the dominant norms ( such as speaking fluent English ) , based on a deficiency orientation , they may be assigned a negatively formulated identity ( Jansen &; Wildemeersch ) and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cote &; Levine , 2002 ) . Therefore , to avoid being assigned a deficient identity , such students may have to bury their authentic selves " within the frames of reference of the host culture " and " squeeze one 's identity within pre-established conventions " ( Luzio-Lockett , 1998 , introduction ) . Problem Statement <p> Guiora ( 1983 ) notes that direct interaction with a second language and its culture can trample one 's original identity and worldview . Because using an unfamiliar language may cause vulnerability and distress , using a second-language may become a " deeply uprooting , self-transforming " experience ( Roth &; Harama , 2000 , p. 763 ) . Most Asian international students do not speak English as their first language . Therefore , according to well-known studies on international students , Asian international students express the greatest difficulty in the use of the English language among international students ( Abu-Ein , 1993 ; Stafford et al. , 1980 ) and perceive the English language as one of their most serious problems ( e.g. , Lin &; Yi , 1997 ; McCoy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 ) . The more different international students ' cultural background is from American culture , the harder their adaptation can be and the more likely they can have emotional problems ( Graham , 1981 ; Pedersen , 1991 ; Wehrly &; Nelson , 1986 ) . Therefore , Asian international students , whose cultural traditions differ widely from those of Americans ( e.g. , Lin &; Yi ; Yeh &; Yang ) , may experience stressful processes when adjusting to American society and culture ( e.g. , Jorgensen , 1997 ; Lin &; Yi ; Yeh &; Yang ) . They are also found to experience more discouragement and anxiety caused by value conflicts and more difficulties in adjusting to American culture than students from other regions ( e.g. , Abe , Talbot , &; Geelhoed , 1998 ; Huang , 1991 ; Pedersen ) . Therefore , Zhang ( 2000 ) concludes that in adjusting to American culture , Asian students have the most difficulty among all international students : <p> European and Canadian students have less difficulty than international students from other parts of the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students from Africa and Asia , Asian students have the most difficulty among all international students . ( p. 7 ) <p> Because of their significant cultural differences and problems with oral English proficiency , Asian international students may have more difficulty than students from other regions in fitting the norms and expectations of the dominant culture , and their identity negotiation may become more challenging after they arrive in the United States . As Yeh and Drost ( 2002 ) argue , " Students who are not from the dominant culture may be victims to unspoken yet powerful stereotypes and messages about their development and personal identity . Hence , they must learn to negotiate and bridge multiple , and often competing , identities in the schools " ( The role of the dominant culture in schools ) . Research on gender and international students ' adjustment to host cultures has found that female students from a different culture may experience more difficulty in adjusting to other cultures than male students ( Manese , Sedlacek , &; Leong , 1984 ; McMillen , 1981 ; Pruitt , 1978 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most difficulty in adjusting to American culture ( e.g. , K. Kitao &; S. K. Kitao , 1989 ; Pedersen , 1991 ; Zhang , 2000 ) , Asian female students therefore may have the most difficulty in adjusting to American culture among all international students . <p> Female Chinese international students may be more vulnerable in negotiating identities desirable to them . Because Con fucianism is the predominant philosophy of Chinese cultural traditions ( e.g. , Brooks , 1997 ; Chen , 1997 ; Oldstone-Moore , 2002 ) , Confucianism has framed such international students ' social expectations and cultural values . Influenced by Confucianism , Chinese people commonly possess respect for social norms and make efforts to create harmony ( e.g. , Berthrong , 1998 ; Chen ; Jung , 1996 ; Muppathinchira , 2002 ; Oldstone-Moore ) . Embracing the Confucian philosophy of harmony , which is the aim of human interaction , and the expected Confucian female role , which is passive and yielding ( e.g. , Oldstone-Moore ) , female Chinese international students , in order to fulfill the expectations of American society and develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may experience more difficulty than female international students from other regions in negotiating identities more desirable or acceptable to them . Therefore , their struggles to negotiate their identities may be more daunting than that of female students from other Asian regions . <p> The tendency to describe and conceptualize international students ' identities avoids social theory , which concerns agency of identity . This silence in the literature leads logically to the inference that international students do not negotiate their identities in any significant way . Previous studies have failed to voice the presence of any sense of negotiation on the part of female Chinese international students . Therefore , I fill this gap by documenting seven female Chinese international students ' experiences of negotiating identity in second-language higher education . Conceptual Framework <p> Language plays a central role in how we understand ourselves and the world , and thus all questions of language control and standardization have major implications for social relations and distribution of power .. Once we start to deal with language as always political , never neutral , its relationship to other forms of power becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 ) <p> Pennycook argues that the English language has become one of the most powerful media of " inclusion into or exclusion from " certain social positions ( p. 81 ) . Because most female international students ' first languages and ethnic cultures differ from the languages and cultures of the dominant group , these international students ' oral English proficiency is usually treated as a deficiency by some Americans . The English language plays an important role in the reproduction of unequal social relations of power between native English speakers and non-native English speakers ( Cook , 1988 ; Derrida , 1989 ; Naysmith , 1987 ; Nieto , 2000 ; Pennycook ; Phillipson , 1988 ) . Therefore , in this study , I take the position of the sociological perspective of identity because this perspective is a useful theoretical perspective to analyze constructs of power and explore the social dimensions of struggle for identity . Sociological perspective of identity is used to conceptualize this study also because the nature of the sociological perspective of identity , which is " multiple , dynamic , and subject to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , acknowledges the role of agency of identity and promises new spaces for identity negotiation ( Yates &; Sclater , 2000 ) . As Somers ( 1994 ) argues , " If identities are fixed there can be no room to accommodate changing power relations  --  or history itself  --  as they are constructed and reconstituted over time " ( p. 611 ) . Therefore , the sociological perspective of identity provides a conceptual framework through which I explored the select group of female international students ' identities . Data Collection and Analysis <p> A qualitative study was conducted to explore and explain how the select group of female Chinese international students negotiated their identities . By using purposive sampling and criterion sampling , seven female Chinese international students from a Midwest public institution of higher education were recruited to participate in this study . Data were collected via individual interviews and the analysis of the participants ' autobiographies . I systematically organized and prepared data for analysis immediately after they were collected . After closely , carefully , and repeatedly listening to the collected raw data , I transcribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligible , along with keeping the authenticity of the data , I did not edit the participant 's words except for changing some tenses into appropriate forms . After transcribing the data , I sent a copy of the transcription to the participants for feedback and verification . Then I repeatedly read through the transcribed and collected data . In order to build a holistic idea about what happened in the data , I drew flow diagrams to help capture each participant 's story . After achieving a sense of the whole , I read the transcribed and collected data carefully and repeatedly to explore the topics of the data . In further re-readings of the materials , I summarized my thinking about the data by writing down my thoughts and annotating the transcriptions with comments about the topics and the meaning of the data . After collecting and transcribing some preliminary data , I sorted the data according to topics , and then I listed collected topics . These topic clusters include main topics , unique topics , and leftovers ( Tesch , 1990 ) . After the topics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data analysis process was assisted by the use of the qualitative data analysis software , N-vivo , to classify related segments of text : key words , phases , and concepts for analysis . Codes were changed , deleted , or added with the N-vivo editor . As more interviews were conducted , I continued coding the rest of the data , comparing the new codes to established codes repeatedly and revising old codes as necessary . After finishing coding the data and organized codes categorically , I generated categories and themes from the codes . Findings and Discussions <p> As Davies and Harre ( 1990 ) note , " Often instances of reflective positioning are contested by others and many individuals find themselves in a perpetual tension between self-chosen identities and others ' attempts to position them differently " ( p. 249 ) . Most of the participants experienced discrepancies between their self-chosen and given identities . However , unlike the claim made by some researchers ( Bhabha , 1990 , Gilbert &; Cooper , 1985 ; Holliday , 1985 ; Litowitz , 1993 ) that marginalized individuals often passively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities attributed to them , this study found that the participants are not the objects ( n1 ) but the subjects of their identities . During the transition to the second-language environment , although all of the participants tried to conform to the social expectations and norms of the host society , they did not uncritically conform to the hegemonic expectations and their given identities . Agreeing with the argument that an individual can be socially determined as a full but incompetent participant ( Cohen , 1998 ; Day , 2002 ; Kanno , 2003 ; Toohey , 2000 ) , this study found that because some Americans ' assumptions of cultural superiority discouraged the participants from becoming competent participants in the host society and made them to reconstruct their identities within the frame of exclusion , As Wenger ( 1998 ) notes , " We not only produce our identities through the practices we engage in , but we also define ourselves through practices we do not engage in . Our identities are constituted not only by what we are but also by what we are not " ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emphasizing personal rights and assertive communication , Asians tend to emphasize the importance of patience , harmony , respect , and deference ( Lin &; Yi , 1997 ) , this study found that the ideology of harmony framed the main ways these participants negotiated their identities . In other words , most of the participants negotiated their identities not as a process in which they tried to direct the interactions to their own favor but rather as a process in which they negotiated identity mainly for the purpose of acquiring intrapersonal harmony and a positive self-identity . According to Ting-Toomey 's ( 1988 ) conflict face-negotiation theory and Rahim 's ( 1992 ) styles of conflict management theory , individuals having collectivistic values are likely to use indirect conflict modes , such as an obliging/accommodating style or an avoidance style to cope with conflicts . Influenced by their ethnic cultural backgrounds with an emphasis of collective values , most of the participants consider direct confrontation to be the last resort to negotiate their identities . Therefore , they tried to avoid assertive communication with others , opting mainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve a positive self-identity through a psychological process , in which " the subject assimilates an aspect , property or attribute of the other and is transformed , wholly or partly , after the model the other provides " ( Laplanche &; Pontalis , 1973 , p. 203 ) . <p> Concurring with Anderson 's ( 1987 ) argument that other peoples ' opinions seem to relate less to identity formation than to how these opinions are perceived by oneself , most of the participants were more concerned with negotiating a positive self-identity than with negotiating a positive social identity . Therefore , their identity negotiation often is an attempt to acquire intrapersonal harmony . However , because power is " created with others rather than being imposed on or exercised over others " ( Cummins , 1996 , p. 11 ) , striving for intrapersonal harmony not only can not upset the unbalanced social relations of power but also may exacerbate the American ideology of cultural homogeneity and the problem of attributing a deficient identity to international students as Americans tend to see such behaviors as submissive . Because power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 11 ) , putting a heavy emphasis on intrapersonal harmony , most of the participants had difficulty in negotiating a social identity acceptable or desirable to them , although they could negotiate a positive self-identity . Therefore , the participants ' ethnic cultural background also posed an additional constraint on their identity development . Contributions <p> This study holds potential for contributing to literature on international students ' identity and to educational practice . First , although there is a large and growing population of female Chinese international students in the United States , their voices are not apparent in discussions of social justice issues . The silence of such students ' voices has logically led to the inference that such international students have not experienced any social injustice in the second-language higher education . Do female Chinese international students not experience social injustice in the second-language higher education ? To answer this question , this study has recorded such international students ' experiences and their identity problems in their own voices . Second , as Barritt ( 1986 ) argues , " By highlighting awareness and creating dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a better understanding of the way things appear to someone else and through that insight lead to improvements in practice " ( p. 20 ) . By opening dialogue between female Chinese international students and college educators and higher education , this study offers helpful information on such female international students ' identity development in the second-language higher education and holds potential for enhancing a broader understanding of identity problems such students may face . Theoretically , a rich understanding of how such students ' identities are constructed in second-language higher education settings will suggest what help such students need from their colleges and teachers to negotiate a positive identity . Finally , this study also holds rich potential for opening dialogue between international students and the American government . Through understanding how international students ' identities are constructed and constrained in the American context , the American government should develop policies that favor diversity of cultures and languages instead of bolstering the American ideology of cultural homogeneity . Implications of this Study <p> Based on the findings of this study , I have suggestions for female Chinese international students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall elaborate on each of these suggestions . Suggestions for International Students <p> Based on the findings of this study , I have three suggestions for female Chinese international students who are struggling with their own identity problems in higher education : My analysis of the narratives found that the participants ' identity development might be constrained also by their Chinese cultural background . Because their emphasis on intrapersonal harmony kept them from acting upon the social world , most of the participants had difficulty in negotiating a social identity acceptable or desirable to them , although they achieved a positive self-perception by using psychological resources . Therefore , to negotiate a positive social identity , female Chinese international students should be cautious about not only the constraints of the host culture but also the constraints of their ethnic cultures on their identity development . Once they become aware of the constraints of their ethnic cultures on their identity development , they can develop a more active attitude to communicate their voices to other people . Contrary to what the participants believed , oral English language proficiency does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a competent participant in the host society , female Chinese international students should be more concerned with how to make their voices heard than with how to speak English with grammatical correctness and fluency . In other words , they should focus on claiming the right to speak as much as on possessing a catalog of linguistic skills of a second-language . Critical thinking is an essential factor in negotiating a positive identity . Without thinking critically about how identity is socially constructed and constrained , female Chinese international students may passively accept their given identities and pursue a complete assimilation . Therefore , such international students should critically examine how their identities are constructed and constrained by the second-language higher education . Suggestions for College Educators <p> How can college educators develop a class atmosphere in which Chinese international students can negotiate a positive social identity in their American classes ? Based on the findings of this study , I have two suggestions for college educators : Most female Chinese international students do not have the same oral English proficiency as American students do . Because a student with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity in class , the unbalanced power relationships between the international students and their teachers and American classmates may make the voices of female Chinese international student harder to hear than the voices of American students . Moreover , because of their weaker oral English proficiency , which may influence the performance of group projects and the presentation of group papers , female Chinese international students often have difficulty in being included and accepted as group members . Therefore , college educators should be aware of the unequal power relationships between female Chinese international students and American students , especially in group discussions and projects . For most of the participants , speaking up in class was not as easy as their American teachers believed . Because Chinese culture values silence , being assertive and expressive is a big challenge for them . Therefore , college educators should not expect them within a short period of time to accommodate to the American culture of speaking up . Because female Chinese international students commonly have difficulty in speaking up , college educators should put more effort into developing a class atmosphere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to speak up . Because such students often can be motivated to speak by their teachers ' encouragement , college educators should praise them for speaking up by saying , for example , " This is a very good question , " or " Your questions are very important for us to think about . " In addition to encouraging female Chinese international students to speak up , college educators should also offer such students other alternatives of class participation so that such students can demonstrate their class participation by writing their learning journals , by conducting e-mail discussions with teachers , or by participating in online discussions . By offering these alternative forms of participation , college educators make it possible for such students to have more time to reflect upon what they learned and give feedback to the class . Suggestions for Higher Education <p> Higher education should offer quality services to international students so that international students can experience less difficulty during their stay in the United States . Based on the findings of this study , I have four suggestions to improve the services of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students patiently . Because most international students have problems with oral English proficiency , higher education administrators , faculty , and staff should talk and listen to them patiently so that such students will not fear asking for help and asking questions . Recruit more staff for the international student offices . Some of the participants reported that they could not receive sufficient and immediate help from their institutions . Because the large population of international students is usually disproportional to the small number of staff in the international student office , the office has difficulty offering quality services to meet the participants ' needs . Because most international students have problems with the English language and are unfamiliar with American culture and the structure of higher education in the United States , they need much more help from their institutions than American students do . Therefore , to meet international students ' needs , colleges and universities should recruit more staff for their international student offices . Develop host family and mentoring programs . Because host family and mentoring programs can compensate for deficiency in services , institutions should develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentors . Via English language school , three of the participants are affiliated with a host family . They all acknowledged the supportive role of their host families and the value of a host family program . Therefore , colleges and universities should develop a host family program and recruit American families to join the program . These families who are interested in intercultural interactions and willing to help international students would be assigned a first-year international student . First-year international students would be able to consult their host families with their problems in adjusting to the second-language environment . In addition to a host family program , a mentoring program also can help international students with their problems in the second-language environment . Once international students enroll in American colleges and universities , their advisors should assign an American student in the same major , with at least one year of experience in the program , to the international students so that the first-year international students would be able to consult with their mentors when they have difficulty in adjusting to the college culture and the structure of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and the surrounding American community , including K-12 schools . Although they all have lived in the United States for at least two years , most of the participants indicated that they still felt they were outside of American society . To enhance international students ' understanding of the host culture and society and increase the American community 's understanding of different cultures , colleges and universities are encouraged to invite their international students to participate in civic and cultural events held by American communities . For example , communities could arrange bus tours to local historic sites to familiarize international students with their communities . With increased understanding of the American culture and society , international students would be better able to develop the ability to solve problems caused by their unfamiliarity with American culture . Colleges and universities are expected to also play the role of helping the younger generation of Americans to examine and unlearn their ideology of cultural homogeneity . To decrease Americans ' fear of diversity of cultures and languages requires Americans to develop an open-minded attitude toward diversity as early as elementary school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities to have intercultural communications with international students , colleges and universities are expected to encourage local elementary and high schools to invite international students to visit their schools . For example , international students could share their educational and cultural experiences in their native countries with American students in social science classes . Suggestions for Policy-Makers <p> In a society dominated by Eurocentric culture , being different may raise " a politics of resentment " ( Grossberg , 1996 , p. 97 ) . Because the American ideology of the cultural homogeneity potentially discriminates against those who are either unable or unwilling to fit the dominant American culture and attributes them a deficient identity ( Blackledge &; Pavlenko , 2001 , Jansen &; Wildemeersch , 1996 ) , this ideology , which promotes " dysfunctionality of differences " and " maintenance of the dominant culture " ( Ferdman , 1990 , p. 183 ) , continues " producing and legitimizing the continued existence of social inequality " ( Blackledge &; Pavlenko , p. 333 ) . Therefore , the identity development of female Chinese international students should not be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility of American society . As Jansen and Wildemeersch argue , " Those who conceive of identity development merely as a private task lose sight of the social and political dimensions of the struggle for identity " ( p. 328 ) . Based on the findings of this study , I have two suggestions for the policy makers to help remove the constraints on international students ' identities , which the participants considered to be imposed by American society : Because learning a different culture and language may increase Americans ' appreciation of diversity of languages and cultures , the American government should promote second-language curricula and require all high school students to take one second-language course for at least two years and continue for another two years in college . Through learning a second-language and culture , American students might become appreciated diversity of cultures and languages and consequently unlearn their assumptions of cultural superiority . Because American policies concerning visas and work permits discriminate against foreigners , many international students can not focus on their studies but instead worry about their visa and financial problems . Working off campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also could allow them to have more opportunities to connect with American society . Therefore , the American government should allow international students to have more opportunities to work off campus . Moreover , the American government should reevaluate its current policies on international students , drawing up policies that favor diversity of cultures and languages and avoiding adopting policies that may exacerbate the American ideology of cultural homogeneity . Conclusions <p> Because female Chinese international students depend mainly on internal and unobtrusive processes or less-confrontational communication to negotiate their identities , their identity negotiation is often overlooked , leading to the assumption that such students do not negotiate their identities in any significant ways . To clarify this assumption , this study has given authority to the select group of female Chinese international students and provides a frame and context for their voices and struggles to be heard and to be valued . All of the participants strove to negotiate their identities . However , because members of the dominant American culture tend not to recognize diversity , most of the participants could not incorporate their multicultural background positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apositive identity , which involves high self-esteem and the ability to influence situations ( Codol , 1975 ) . Although most of the participants experienced constraints on their identity development , they strove to negotiate their identities and " behave as agents who resist , negotiate , change , and transform themselves and others " ( Blackledge &; Pavlenko , 2004 , p. 10 ) . The participants constructed their identities not only through the process of identification but also through the process of negotiation . Therefore , each of them has constructed their subjects of identity in the second-language higher education .
