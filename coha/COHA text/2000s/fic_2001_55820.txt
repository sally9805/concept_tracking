THIS IS A STORY I would have told grandchildren  --  and great-grandchildren  --  if I 'd had any . I had three wives , but no children . That 's a mystery , I suppose . As it 's a mystery that I 've been around for more than a century and am still blessed with reasonably fair health . I also remember what I had for breakfast this morning and who I talked with . You might have to remind me who you are if you come back , but that was always true . They say the far past becomes clearer as you get older and the near past gets dim . Well , I remember some things clearer than others , and there does n't seem to be a pattern I can figure . More than ninety years ago , when I was almost twelve years old , something happened that I knew nothing would ever erase from my memory . <p> When I tell you about it , you wo n't ever forget it either . <p> In the summer of 1903  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century  --  we lived in a little three-bedroom house on the outskirts of Baltimore . My mother and father , my older sister Livvie , and me . In mid-June , Father came down with a bad fever . He was delirious for three days , and for a while everybody thought he was going to die . He was a young man , only thirty-four , but he got very dehydrated , and his fever kept getting higher . Then Mother came down with it as well , and Livvie and I were shuffled off to our neighbor 's house . <p> That was where we got sick . <p> Nobody knew quite what to do with us . The neighbor , Mrs. Lessing , was afraid to move us , or be near us either . For all anyone knew , our parents were dying , we were all dying . Mrs. Lessing got so frightened that she went to the post office and sent a telegram to her cousin , out in Frederick , and he came in with his wagon and mules and took her away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Anna was a black woman of about thirty . I was nearly blind with fever and she seemed too large for the room  --  not heavy , but big-boned and tall , with thick features and long-fingered , smooth hands . At least the backs of them were smooth . The palms made a pleasant scratching when they moved across your face , or rested on your forehead . When the fever would let up , during the day , she told us about the heavy mists in London , and how she had seen the terrible Tower , where people were kept for years , some waiting to have their heads cut off . She knew all the names of the kings and queens of England  --  Plantagenets and Stuarts and Tudors  --  and in the brief respite from sickness there was something wonderful about imagining palace intrigue in a faraway place . Livvie wanted more about the executions . Anna would demur for a time , denying that she knew anything so gruesome ; then she would go on and say there is nothing more gruesome than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft drawl about Henry VIII 's unfortunate wives , or Mary Queen of Scots . <p> I liked her , liked listening to her soft contralto voice . She described for us the frightful conditions on the ship she came to America on as a little girl , the deaths at sea , and how they slipped the bodies over the side off a long wooden board . Her ancestors were free blacks who lived in Wales . She had stories about her father , who had trained in medicine down in Alabama , where she grew up , and had taught her some of what he knew . When she spoke of the mistress of the house , her eyes said more than her words . She had a low opinion of old Mrs. Lessing , who was as silly as she was cowardly . <p> " Y'all understand , " she 'd say quietly . " This world is , um , upside down . " <p> Before it was over , she got sick , too . Her coal-colored skin gleamed with sweat , and when she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head , it was as if she had collapsed there . " Lord , " she said . " I feel lowdown . " <p> But she never stopped tending to us . She told us of growing up in Alabama , and coming north on the train , and meeting Thaddeus Marcus Adams , of Pratt Street in the city of Baltimore . She liked to use the phrase . " Listen to it , darlings , " she said , running a cold rag over Livvie 's cheeks . " Thaddeus Marcus Adams , of Pratt Street in the city of Baltimore . " Sometimes she sang it , lifting my shirt from my back and washing me , her hands burning with fever . At night we waited for her , and the sound of her in the house kept me awake . She moved through my dreams , and Thaddeus Marcus Adams got mixed up in them , too . I dreamed he spoke to me , and washed my forehead . I had a memory , which I am now fairly certain was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing a tall , powerful-looking brown man in the upper hallway of the house . He wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled above the elbow , and I saw the thick veins standing out on his arms . <p> I tried to ask Anna if this was Thaddeus . She was singing low , still feverish , spooning broth into my mouth . " Hush , " she said . " Hush , child . You been dreaming . " <p> " Is it Thaddeus ? " I said . " Tell me . " <p> " Thaddeus is away , " she said . " You must n't speak of him in this house . You must 've dreamed it , child . " But then she put her head down and rocked slow , as if she might slump over . " My head . " <p> " Here , " I said . And I took the rag from her hand and put it on her forehead . She raised her head slightly , and breathed . It was only a moment . She straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , child . " <p> Anna , I tried to say . I only wanted to say her name . But I could n't get it out . I nodded , and felt there must be something between us , a secret . When Livvie and I had first come to the house , we did n't even know her . She was just the next-door-lady 's person-kitchen help . I do n't think we had even known her name until that week . <p> Mother was next door , dangerously close to dying . Father 's fever had broken , but he was still very weak , and other neighbors were with them . For that strange week we were a sundered family , being cared for in separate houses . I seldom thought of my family . I spent dream hours , awake and asleep , with Anna Scott . <p> The worst night of my fever I thought I looked out the window of the bedroom where I lay and saw my father in his coffin in a flickering yellow light in the next house , hands crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as though I had abandoned him to that fate . I lay crying and muttering that I was sorry . I 'm sure now that I dreamed this , since I know the room I was in faced away from our house and the view out that window was of the fairgrounds , where the circus came every summer . <p> After the fever passed , Mrs. Lessing returned from the country , and a day or so later we went back to our house . At almost twelve and fourteen , we were not quite old enough yet to understand the particulars of the social setup in 1903 . Obviously it was the air we lived in , but we had no conscious sense of that . We saw Mrs. Lessing ordering Anna Scott around , making her clean the surfaces of the bedroom with strong lye soap . And the old lady shooed Livvie and me away whenever we came near . We represented disease to her . That was what Father said when we went home . He was going to work again in the mornings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust bank in town . Mother was still recovering , and the heat and humidity were no help . She lay on her bed in her long nightgown , gleaming not so much with fever , though a mild one did persist through the hot days , but with the windless summer heat . Women from other houses stopped by now and then to look in on her , and to bring her iced tea and books to read . People expected Livvie and me to keep out of the way , not to trouble Mother . <p> We sought chances to talk to Anna Scott . She would be out back , hanging wash . <p> " What do you children want with me ? " she 'd ask , half-smiling . " You 're gon na get me into trouble , sure enough . " <p> " In France , " Livvie said , " they have a thing called a gillo-teen . " <p> Anna corrected her . " You pronounce it gee-yo-teen . It 's a terrible thing . " <p> " It cuts off people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes still look around after the head 's rolling around on the ground . " <p> " Who told you that ? " <p> " I heard it , " Livvie said . " I swear . " <p> " The head falls into a basket , " Anna said . <p> I felt lightheaded . I turned to Livvie . " Is that all you can talk about ? " <p> " Tell us how it works , " Livvie said to Anna Scott . <p> " I do n't have any idea how it works , child . " <p> " Why did they only use it in France , Anna ? " <p> " I 've never been to France . " <p> " Would you like to go ? " I asked , and felt as if I 'd proposed that we go together . <p> She gave me a long look that seemed to reach down into my chest . I could n't breathe . " Why , John , are you toying with my affections ? " <p> I did n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her work . " Do n't you children have anything better to do than pester me ? You know Miz Lessing is gon na give me grief if she sees us . " <p> " We do n't have anywhere else to go , " Livvie said . <p> This was true . The only other child our age who lived at that end of Market Street was Dewey Dumfreys , and she could not be depended on for entertainment . Dewey was an albino , but we did n't know this . I mean no one had said anything to us about it . We just knew she could n't be out in the sun very much , that her skin was pale as paste , her hair a startling white , whiter than we could believe anyone 's ever was , even when we were looking at it ; and her eyes were a strange-looking pink the color of a rabbit 's nose . She spent a lot of time writing in a journal . She seemed never to want to do anything else . She seldom left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would call to us when we came out of the house . It depended on her mood , of course , and she was rather inclined to fits of unsociability . <p> The particular afternoon I 'm remembering , we were fresh from fever , Livvie and I. That 's how it seems to me anyway , recalling it  --  a hot , humid , cloudless day with a stillness about it , as if the earth had stopped spinning on its axis and was fixed in a searing pool of sun . Things seemed bright with an unnatural brightness , a feverish glare , perhaps because we had been ill and were now better . Mother had told us to go outside , and to stay in the yard . We were on the porch . Anna Scott was beating the dust out of a rug in Mrs. Lessing 's side yard . The day was on fire , too hot for work . I held onto the porch post . Lines of heat rose in the air . Anna Scott turned and looked at us , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , Mrs. Lessing stood watching her like a hawk . When Anna glanced our way , Mrs. Lessing said something we could n't hear , and Anna said something back that ended in " ma'am . " She waved at us , went back in the house . <p> " I 'm tired , " Livvie said to me . <p> We knew that some people had died of this fever we had survived . Livvie stared at her hands . I think we were both experiencing the sense of how different it was to be on the other side of the sickness . Mother coughed upstairs , and I had a guilty moment of wanting to get away from the sound . The stillness carried every stirring , every breath . We went out to the end of the yard and looked up and down the street . In the distance , beyond the railroad yard , you could see the big , partially collapsed red-white-and-blue tent from the circus that had always come to town from mid-May to mid-July , and that a lot of people were unjustly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing down early . <p> Dewey Dumfreys strolled over from her porch , wearing a floppy straw hat , a long-sleeved blouse , and a skirt that covered her feet . You could n't see her feet . She appeared to glide like a ghost across the grass . " Know what happened ? " she said , then did n't wait for an answer : " My Uncle Harry came in from work about an hour ago and told us there 's been a terrible accident down at the rail yard . An elephant fell off the back of the train . They were coming to catch up with the circus , all the way from Scranton , and this one named Sport got playful and he backed against the door of the car and the door broke and he went flying off and landed on the track  --  off a moving train car . An elephant , think of it . Uncle Harry said he screamed a terrible scream . They were bringing them  --  two of them  --  to the circus . " <p> " The circus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because of the fever . " <p> " Well , they were getting two elephants and now one of them 's dead and they 're gon na have to kill the other one to put it out of its misery . " <p> " What happened to the other one ? " I said . " Did it fall , too ? " <p> " No , the one that fell is still alive . But he ca n't move his legs , or stand up . The other one just up and died . Maybe from the shock . Maybe they love each other like people . Maybe the shock of her friend falling off the train killed her . " <p> Livvie saw Anna Scott come from the Lessing house , wearing a white scarf like a bandana . We ran over to her , and Dewey repeated her story , adding the detail that the people at the rail yard had used a big freight derrick to hoist Sport back onto the train car . " They think his back might be broken . My Uncle Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna looked up the road in the direction of the rail yard , then looked back at us . " My friend Thaddeus works there , " she said in that voice I loved . " He 'll know what happened . " <p> " It 's the God 's truth , " Dewey said . <p> " Oh , I ai n't doubting you , honey . " <p> We all stood there , looking down the street . You could see some of the apparatus of the rail yard , and across the road , beyond the houses , there were tracks that led there . There was a raised bed that was visible in the winter months , and when a train came through you could see it going by in flashes between hedges and houses and trees . We never paid much attention to the trains because they had been there all our lives . Their sound , roaring along in the wake of smoke and the blaring of a whistle , was as unremarkable to us as the clop-clop of horses ' hooves in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go see , " Livvie said . <p> Anna shook her head . " Honey , you know your mother would n't want that . " <p> " She 'll let us if you take us , " Livvie said . <p> " To the rail yard ? Me ? Young lady , you sure you still do n't have fever ? " She put her dark hand on Livvie 's brow , which was almost as pale as Dewey 's . <p> " Can we ask her ? " I said . I was speaking with the confidence of one who was close enough to her to know about Thaddeus Marcus Adams . <p> Anna frowned . " I think you best let her sleep . Do n't you , John ? " <p> My name on those lips thrilled me . I felt the blood rush to my face . " Yes , " I said , being responsible . <p> " Well , tell you what , " Anna said . " I 'll go on down there this afternoon and see what I can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how 'd that be ? " <p> Livvie was n't impressed . " It 's not the same as seeing it . " <p> " There 's probably nothing to see , honey . It 's over , whatever it was . " <p> From inside , just then , came the voice of Mrs. Lessing . " You ! Anna ! What 're you doing talking to those children ? I asked you to go get some tonic for me . " <p> " Yes 'm , " Anna called back . <p> " I do n't have all day to wait for you . " <p> " No 'm , I know . I 's going jes ' as quick as I can , Miz Lessing . " By this time Livvie and I were accustomed to the difference in Anna 's speech when she spoke to Mrs. Lessing . I considered it part of our special relation to each other . Anna murmured to us : " I 'll see if I ca n't find out something . Y'all stay here . And Dewey , you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yes ' m . " <p> We watched her cross the street and go up the block , away from the rail yard and toward the old part of town , where the dry-goods store and the pharmacy were . She waved just before she went out of sight . <p> " My mother says Anna 's a faithless heathen , " Dewey said . " I think she 's nice . " <p> " I wish Mrs. Lessing would go back to Frederick , " said Livvie . <p> We wandered to Dewey 's front porch , where we sat in metal chairs . Nothing moved . There was n't a breeze anywhere in the world . The leaves hung on the trees , wilting . The hottest day in the history of summer . Dewey 's Uncle Harry was on the back porch , talking to her mother . We could n't make out the words through the open windows , and we wanted to , so we said nothing , trying to hear . But they were two rooms and a corridor away . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pitcher of lemonade on the little table between their chairs . <p> " Hey , kids , " Uncle Harry said . " Hot enough for you ? " He took a sip of the lemonade and made a face . <p> " You kids stay close , " Dewey 's mother said . " There 's trouble , serious trouble . " <p> " We know all about it , " Dewey said . <p> Uncle Harry sat forward . " What do you know , little girl ? " <p> " About the elephant . " <p> " Oh , " he said . " That . " He sat back . We waited for him to say more , but he sipped the lemonade and stared off . Dewey started talking about the circus . She had been twice , she said ; her uncle had taken her . She went on about what she 'd seen there . <p> I heard her mother say to Uncle Harry , " I think he 's got himself a lady friend in the next house , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Uncle Harry said . <p> " If I 'm not mistaken . I 've seen him at the back door over there , hanging around her . You know what kind of friend I mean . " <p> " Of course . " <p> " They 're all so highly ... they have no inhibitions where  --  well , I mean I think it 's frightening . " <p> Dewey 's uncle said nothing for a moment . Then : " Does Mrs. Lessing know ? " <p> " She 'd fire her in an instant . " <p> " Well , it 's a small world . " <p> " What do you think they 'll do with him ? " Mrs. Dumfreys asked , and I understood , with a shock , that they must be talking about Thaddeus Marcus Adams , of Pratt Street in the city of Baltimore . <p> I said , " What did he do ? " <p> Uncle Harry looked at me . <p> " Uncle Harry , " Dewey said . " Tell us about the elephant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to think about the elephant . " <p> " Please ? " <p> He turned to Mrs. Dumfreys . " I 'm not kidding you , the worst noise I ever heard , that scream . I never thought an animal could make such a sound . I mean there was something intelligent about it . " He sat there , with the glass of lemonade held to his lips . <p> Mrs. Dumfreys poured more and said , " Ca n't you children find something to do out front ? " <p> " What did he do ? " I repeated . <p> " Who ? " Uncle Harry said . Then : " Do n't be impertinent , young man . " <p> I started to say the name Thaddeus , but thought better of it . I was afraid I might get Anna Scott in trouble . <p> " Dewey , take John and Livvie around to the front porch , please , " Mrs. Dumfreys said . <p> " Ca n't we have some lemonade ? " <p> Mrs. Dumfreys considered a moment . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey went in and brought out three glasses and filled them from the pitcher . We sat on the back-porch steps and drank the faintly stinging , sweet lemonade . The glasses beaded up immediately , and the drink looked even better than it tasted . After a while we saw Mrs. Lessing come out of her house and go along the alley to the street behind us . <p> Dewey was rattling on about the lemonade at the circus , and I kept my attention on Uncle Harry and Mrs. Dumfreys . <p> " You suppose Mrs. Lessing knows about it already ? " he asked . <p> " She will soon enough . " <p> " Would you keep a maid with a boyfriend who would threaten a white wom  --  " Uncle Harry stopped . Mrs. Dumfreys had caught me listening , and held her hand up . Very softly she said , " John , you and the girls go play . " <p> We walked around to the front of the house . I felt restless and impatient to know more . Again we were listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought I heard the word impertinent again . <p> " I 'm sick of this , " Livvie said . " Let 's do something . " <p> " I 'm going to the freight yard , " said Dewey . She stepped down off the porch . <p> We heard Mother cough from the bedroom window above the side yard . The sound made us pause . But she was in bed , half-dreaming . The white lace curtains of the window were still as stone . In that heat they looked as if they might burst into flame . Beyond the space of the window was the wall clock . It chimed once . We waited . It was as if we were waiting for the sound of the clock again . Or for Mother 's cough . But there was only the murmur of the voices on the back porch . <p> " Come on , " Dewey said . " If you 're coming . " <p> " You 're not supposed to be out in the sun , " Livvie said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm protected , " said Dewey . " I 'm tired of sitting around . They 'll sit out there for at least another hour . " <p> We followed her out to the sidewalk and on to the end of the street , then across . The rail yard was about a quarter-mile away , and we went slow , as if to hurry would reveal our true purpose . On one porch , someone darker than Anna Scott sat rocking a baby , the baby crying and protesting . We 'd heard the cries a long way away . The woman watched us for a few paces , then gave over to worrying about what was in her lap . <p> The train yard smelled suffocatingly of coal and creosote and smoke . There were cars ranged along one wide group of about a dozen pairs of rails  --  the hold yard , as I later learned-and we went past this , on toward the office , where two men stood smoking . They were about the same age , both blond and with the grime of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweat off . The tall one wore a vest and a short-sleeved white shirt . The other was shiftless , in overalls . <p> " We came to see the hurt elephant , " Dewey said to them . <p> " Get on out of here , " said the tall one . " The three of you , if you know what 's good for you . Get . " <p> We did n't move . <p> " Wait a minute , Jesse , " the other one said . He leaned toward us , blowing smoke . He stared at Dewey . " What the hell , if you ai n't the whitest child I ever saw . Look at this , Jesse . Man , this is the opposite of a nigger . " <p> Jesse laughed . " Cal , you 're a crazy sumbitch . You know it ? " <p> " Watch your language , " Cal said . Then he spoke into Dewey 's face . " Ai n't you the complete opposite of a nigger . " <p> Dewey 's lower lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty , sweat-beaded face . Up close , I saw they were both older men . <p> " We want to see the elephant that fell off the train , " I said . <p> The one named Jesse said , " Well , maybe you can and maybe you ca n't . " He had brown teeth , and he spit through them , then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . He had stepped closer to Dewey , who stiffened without giving any ground . I smelled tobacco and sweat . Jesse said , " You know , I bet these street urchins would taste good on a bed of lettuce , Cal . " <p> " I bet they would , " said Cal . He rubbed his stubbled face , then flicked the cigarette into the cinders of the yard . He brought a pouch and papers out of his shirt pocket and began to roll another . <p> " Heck , " Jesse said . " Maybe they ought to see our little party . Might do ' em good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Watch your language . " <p> " Come on , " Dewey said to us . " They do n't know anything . " <p> We walked away . After a few paces I turned , and they were standing there , staring . <p> " Hey , " Cal yelled . And he pointed . There were more tracks ahead . A small group of men had gathered near an empty railroad car . They were moving with a quickness , as if struggling with something or trying to lift something . Cal whistled , and gestured for us to go over there . <p> " Well ? " Dewey said to me . <p> " You go , " Livvie said . <p> Dewey started , but then turned back . <p> " I 'll go , " I said . I kept to the edge of the rails . There were other cars beyond this one . I wondered which one held the elephant , and what these men I was approaching must have already done with the one that had died . The grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained with coal dust . The men had become still , their backs to me . I got to within about twenty yards of the car before one of them turned and saw me  --  a big man in a seersucker suit and a straw hat . He walked a few paces in my direction . " There 's nothing for you here , " he said . <p> The backs parted , and in the middle of the crowd I saw a brown man in what had been a white shirt . His face was battered and bleeding  --  you could n't tell much about the features for the swelling of the eyes and the blood on his jaw and neck . The blood was all over the white shirt , which hung on his big chest in shreds . His hands were behind his back . He looked at me . They jostled him and closed in around him , moving to the other side of the car . I saw their feet there , a lot of confused motion and straining . <p> The man in the straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home where you belong . " It was clear that he meant to evict me physically if he had to . I backed away , then turned and ran . When I glanced over my shoulder , I saw that he was chasing me , big , lumbering steps , arms flailing at his sides . I yelled , and Livvie  --  who was always faster than I  --  left us behind , running far ahead . I caught up to Dewey , and we crossed the rails , then angled back toward Market Street through a field of dry knife-grass that stung our legs , and big blue stones  --  quarry stones , they looked like  --  that tripped us up . We climbed the roadbed and stumbled across the rails and down the other side , and went on between the houses , Livvie leading the way . Back on Market Street , we lay down on the grass of the first lawn , fighting for breath . My heart pounded in my neck and face , behind my eyes . For a long while we could n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ? What were they doing ? " <p> " We just wanted to see the dang thing , " said Dewey . <p> " Tell us , " Livvie said . <p> I said , " I did n't see anything . " I remember thinking that it was my business , not hers or Dewey 's . <p> We were quiet then . A wagon came up the street , two large drays pulling it , and a boy sitting on the bench with a piece of Johnson grass in his mouth . The boy looked at us as the wagon came by , and when he lifted a skinny hand to wave , I waved back . <p> " I bet the elephant 's already shipped somewhere else , " Dewey said . <p> We got to our feet and went along the street . When we reached Dewey 's house , we walked through the airless hallway to the kitchen and onto the back porch . There was n't anyone there . We drank water from the well and poured it over our faces . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day to change . My head spun a little , probably from the running , but it frightened me . I felt sick . I watched the windows of Mrs. Lessing 's house , and nothing stirred there . <p> Dewey said , " I wonder where they are . " <p> " Probably looking for us , " Livvie said . <p> " Why did that man chase us ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " How do I know ? " <p> We were abruptly irritable with each other . They were looking at me . I wondered if what I had seen might be visible in my face . It was hard to believe they could n't see it . I felt it in my cheeks like a bruise . <p> Presently , Anna Scott came into the alley from the side street where Mrs. Lessing had gone earlier . She came slow , hands knotted at her abdomen . I stepped down to the well with one of the lemonade glasses and filled it with water , then hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and paused , her lips parted slightly . She was crying . I saw that she was standing there crying , and I wanted so to touch her . To say something , anything . She ran the backs of her hands over her eyes . I had the sense that I had known all along she would be like this when I saw her again . <p> " Hey , " I managed to say . " Want some water ? " <p> She spoke through her teeth . " Is that how you address a grownup ? ' Hey ? ' " <p> " No , " I said . <p> She sobbed . <p> " Anna . " <p> Her lips curled back . " You get away from me . " She sobbed again . Then she spit the words at me : " White boy . " Her depthless eyes fixed me there , and held me out . I could almost see them shut down under the black irises . She said nothing more , but crossed to Mrs. Lessing 's back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Livvie said as I returned to Dewey 's back porch . <p> I sat on the top step , silent , watching where Anna had gone . I guess Livvie knew enough not to ask me again . I think I understood most of what had already happened . And I wonder if it even needs retelling here . Thaddeus Marcus Adams of Pratt Street in the city of Baltimore had said something that a white lady considered flippant , and for this had been beaten to within an inch of his life and strung up on a streetlamp at the border of what everyone back then called Darktown . Some people from his neighborhood had cut him down , and he was not dead , but he was blind , he would never walk without a limp , and of course any kind of life he might have had was over forever . The lady who had been insulted had nearly run him down with her surrey as he came from lunch at a cafe on Market Street , walking toward the railroad yard to see about an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual thing about that day took place in the evening at six . <p> They hanged the elephant . Livvie and I went with my father to see it . Dewey and her mother were there , too . A lot of people from the town came out . It was like a festival . They had got the elephant unconscious with ether , and they put a chain around his leathery neck and began lifting him on the same freight derrick they had earlier used to put him back up on the train car . He woke as the chain pulled him up to standing on his hind legs , so that it looked like a trick . He screamed , even through the tightness of the chain . It had disappeared where it was wrapped around the neck , but the line of it jutted from the loose flesh , on up to the top of the freight derrick , tight as a piano wire .

They let the chain down again , with a rush , and the elephant was on his knees . I realized again that he could n't stand or walk . A man I recognized as Jesse tried to administer more ether , but it was no use , so again they set the winch going , and the chain tightened and lifted , and they kept it going until the animal looked to be standing upright again , front legs hanging down , back legs supporting no weight but still touching the ground . An instant later the elephant emptied his bowels and bladder , and there was a gasp of alarm and fright in the crowd . I heard Livvie yell , a sound like a cry in a nightmare . I looked at Dewey and her mother . Dewey 's eyes were wide , her mouth open . There was a blue vein forking up her white brow . The chain cranked loud , and startled me . It kept lifting , and the animal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he cleared the ground he began to turn in the air , a slow rotation , the chain so tight into the flesh of the neck that I thought it might separate the head from the tremendous weight of the body . We watched the body rotating slowly , inanimate and limp . But the elephant was still breathing . A veterinarian , holding a handkerchief over his nose , put a stethoscope against the great side of the animal , then looked at the others and shrugged , and they all stood back and waited a while , trying not to breathe the effluvium of what had come from the body . Twice the process was repeated , at intervals of several minutes . Each time there was another shrug . Another wait . Finally the vet nodded , with his instrument , and the chain was slowly loosened , the hind legs and haunches settled into the mess , weirdly out of kilter  --  the front legs bending outward at a ridiculous and terrifying angle . They stopped the chain , and men began to disperse the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occurred to anyone as a hazard . <p> But it seemed so now . The crowd was ushered out , and soon Father and Livvie and I were walking along Market Street , toward home . Dewey and her mother were a few paces ahead of us . It looked like Dewey was helping her mother along . Livvie cried softly , and Father assured her that the elephant had n't suffered . But we had seen the suffering , and we were not calmed by his words . I was carrying in my mind the image of Anna Scott 's crying face , and the blood on Thaddeus Marcus Adams 's torn white shirt . But there was the elephant , too  --  the stupendous , outsized spectacle of its dying . I thought the world a terrible place , and I thought I had learned this in the space of that one day . I looked at the fading light in the sky and felt my equilibrium shift and go off . It was as if the fever had come back . As I had the thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> Father touched her forehead . " You do n't feel warm . " <p> We came to Mrs. Lessing 's house , and there was a light in the window though it was n't quite dusk yet . Mother was on our porch . She walked out to meet us . Mrs. Lessing came out , too . Dewey and her mother were already in their own house , shutting curtains . <p> " I 've had to fire my maid , " Mrs. Lessing said . " I 'm afraid she was part of that business up the street . " <p> " The elephant ? " Mother asked . <p> " We 'll talk later , " said Father . " Good night , Mrs. Lessing . " <p> " The animal is dead , then ? " <p> Father nodded . " It did n't go off as smoothly as they 'd thought . We never should 've gone down there to see it . " <p> " I wish we 'd stayed home , " Livvie said . She sniffled and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked back toward the rail yard . The first stars were twinkling above it . <p> " What was she talking about ? " Mother asked Father as we went inside . " What business up the street ? " <p> " Some black opened his mouth when he should n't have . And paid the price for it . " <p> It was Father , many years later , who told me what they did to Thaddeus Adams . I had to jog his memory by explaining that it happened the day they hanged the elephant . He described it all , though he was n't there to see it . In his estimation of things , it was unfortunate but necessary . <p> He worked hard to teach me honor , the love of one 's family , the value of self-sacrifice , of kindness and concern , graciousness and thrift , industriousness and hard work , the love of country . <p> I never knew or found out what else might have happened , or how Thaddeus fared in his harmed life . And I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . Dewey moved away before I reached majority . One fall morning her house was empty , and new people moved in a week later . My parents lived to great age , into the early hundreds . We buried Livvie in the spring of 1958 , after an automobile accident . She was sixty-seven . Mother and Father were still healthy , even strong . Livvie 's family took good care of them that day . Livvie had raised three handsome and successful boys . They spoke with my father and me about all the trouble the coloreds , as they were then called , were causing . I went along with their talk , fearing the disapproval I might face if I said anything , and , I confess , agreeing with some of what was said . But then I remembered Anna Scott , talking to me in fever , in the year 1903 .... <p> I 've grown so old .... Everybody 's gone now . <p> Sometimes , lately , I dream that I 'm in that railroad yard and I ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the chain , under the fretwork of the derrick , the iron supporting bars making a skinny black shadow on the red sky . I 'm turning to look behind me ; something awful is there , but I ca n't see it . Something weighs me down so heavily that my movements are terrifyingly slow . I move , but nothing seems to change . I 'm a statue , utter stillness , trying to turn , trying to open my eyes in the blindness , and I never do see what waits in that dream that is so threatening  --  other men , a man , something not human , I never know in the dream . But I think I know . After I wake up , I think I know . And I try to gather the practical matters of my present life to myself like a protective cloak : the schedule here , the time , the coming morning . Betrayal can happen miles and years away . It can go on happening , down in the heart , in the dark . So these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't come at all , and I lie here remembering that day so far past , when Anna Scott , crying , looked at me that way and called me " white boy , " and later I stood in a crowd that had gathered to watch the death of the beast . <p> <p> By Richard Bausch <p>
