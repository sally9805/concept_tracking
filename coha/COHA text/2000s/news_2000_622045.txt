<p> SUV AI N'T NOTHING BUT A TRUCK <p> Editor  --  Now that the Ford Motor Co . ( Chronicle , May 12 ) has admitted to the dangers of SUVs , it 's time to treat these vehicles for what they are . . . trucks . Trucks must drive in the far right lanes , are not allowed in certain neighborhoods and have a different tax structure . There are signs all over the Marina District in San Francisco , for example , restricting trucks . It is time to start enforcing the laws that were created to protect people 's safety and quality of life . <p> WALTER HAAS III <p> San Francisco <p> DEADLY SUVS <p> Editor  --  It 's refreshing that the chairman of Ford Motor Co . ( Chronicle , May 12 ) admits that SUVs are major contributors to air pollution . But it is a bit disingenuous to claim that they are only responding to consumer demand . Demand for these pollution-spewing behemoths did not arise out of nowhere ; it was created by the automobile manufacturers ' aggressive marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing consumer demand for environmentally friendly transportation options , as so many of us have been awaiting , demand for SUVs will dissipate . <p> It 's also very interesting that Ford worries that automakers will wind up looking like the tobacco industry . SUVs are the vehicular equivalent of cigarettes : They make you feel cool when you start using them , but collectively and cumulatively , their effects are deadly to living things . <p> RUTH E. MALONE <p> Oakland <p> DEFENSIVE DRIVING <p> Editor  --  Re : SUV coverage . <p> I see now how I 'm guilty of being politically incorrect . This is because I consciously choose to drive a large vehicle to protect myself and my family from irresponsible and unsafe drivers . In my 28 years of driving , I have never been at fault in any accident . I have been hit , however , on several occasions by other , less careful drivers . For me , the safety provided by an SUV far outweighs the operating costs . <p> When " socially responsible " people argue that SUVs " endanger other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to drive small , lightweight economy cars , they want to force me to jeopardize my safety to satisfy their agenda . <p> If people carried 10-foot sticks for protection , I would be a fool to carry only an 8-foot stick . Finally , I think it is just as wrong to judge people by their vehicles . You do not know me . I am not evil simply because I drive an SUV . <p> STEPHEN VIZZINI <p> S. San Francisco <p> SUPPORT CHINA TRADE <p> Editor  --  Congress will vote May 22 on granting normal trade relations status to China on a permanent basis or to maintain the present status , which is reviewed and granted every year . <p> I am reminded of the former president of General Motors , Charles Erwin Wilson , who later went on to become U.S. Secretary of Defense , when he said , " For years , I ( have ) thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors and vice versa . " Presidents Ford , Carter and Bush join President Clinton in agreeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States for China to be granted permanent normal trade relations status . Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , is also in full support of this proposal . <p> Permanent normal trade relations status for China , along with admission into the World Trade Organization , will benefit both China and the United States because it allows all the U.S. companies doing business with China to have the ability to plan long term and is a key to ensuring peace in this world . <p> HARRY ORBELIAN <p> S.F. Global Trade Council <p> San Francisco <p> SUBJECTIVE JUSTICE <p> Editor  --  Debra Saunders needs to come down off her high horse and get a dose of reality ( " A Nice Break for the Killer of Shirley Hill , " May 9 ) . <p> There is only one way to interpret the " criminal justice " system ( which in itself is an oxymoron ) , and that is philosophically . Many of us , who have had the misfortune to have loved ones ( either as victims , the accused or convicted ) entangled in this system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have come to realize that " justice " is a subjective term . <p> Criminal justice is affected by newspapers , political cycles and the prevailing opinions . How can we trust the death penalty to such a system ? <p> Ms. Saunders seems to think that a life sentence in a California state prison is a " nice break . " It is precisely that type of cavalier , uninformed opinion that has led to the problems we now face with criminal justice in California . Our burgeoning economy in California has led to a reduction in crime rates , yet our prisons are bursting at the seams . <p> We have a huge excess in our state budget , yet it is politically correct to build more prisons , but politically incorrect to provide adequate medical care , protection and basic human rights to those already incarcerated , or to provide programs for their rehabilitation . <p> Nothing will ease the pain of the Hill family  --  not execution  --  not life imprisonment . Nothing will bring back their loved one , Shirley Hill . <p> LISA FABRIZIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that our Energy Department has plans to spend $4.6 billion dollars a year to renovate 6,000 aging nuclear warheads over the next 15 years . According to START II , the agreement we ratified in 1996 , we agreed to reduce our arsenal to less than 3,500 warheads  --  so why are we spending billions to maintain 6,000 , when 3,000 should be scrapped ? <p> Russia has finally signed START II , and talks for START III ( which would reduce warheads to 1,500 ) have already begun . <p> As Sen. Jesse Helms avers , international agreements mean nothing when our Congress or Department of Defense can scrap them at will . A little hard on our national honor , would n't you agree ? <p> ALLEN SHELTON <p> Hillsborough <p> AVOID FAT STEREOTYPES <p> Editor  --  In spite of a prejudiced editorial in the Chronicle , I urge Mayor Brown not to veto the size-and-height measure . San Francisco has a global reputation as one of the least-prejudiced cities on Earth . This is an opportunity to bring before all people our concern that fat people should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAPPLEBECKPALMER <p> Berkeley <p> FREE ' TRIGGER LOCKS ? <p> Editor  --  George W. Bush has announced that , as president , he would ask Congress to approve funds to distribute " free " trigger locks to gun owners . I agree that use of trigger locks is a reasonable step for increased safety , but I wonder why taxpayers should subsidize gun owners . <p> Car owners pay for their own seat belts , and swimming pool owners are required to install fences . Taxpayers do n't pay for these reasonable safety measures . Why should n't gun owners be required to pay for reasonable safety measures ? <p> STEFAN E. ADLERS <p> San Francisco <p> FORGIVE US OUR DEBT <p> Editor  --  Hey , ( Gov . ) Gray ( Davis ) : A rally by Richmond residents was held Friday in Sacramento to show support for forgiveness of the Richmond School District 's debt to the state . You propose that the Franchise Tax Board return to each state taxpayer $150 dollars from the budget surplus . <p> Why do n't you just hold onto the rebates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it 's not enough , at least they 've paid it down . If it 's more than we need , then return a prorated rebate . Fairness to all . <p> PHIL SCORDELIS <p> Concord <p> ANIMAL SYMBOLISM <p> Editor  --  I , too , oppose cosmetic surgery for animals . However , I also oppose the S.F. Commission of Animal Control and Welfare wasting their time and our money by hearing and voting to take a SYMBOLIC stand against the practice . <p> Veterinarians are regulated by the state . If they choose to ignore the stand , then it is meaningless . If they make money surgically altering animals , then they will continue until banned . So what is the point of the commission 's stand ? <p> SUSAN BERNARD <p> San Francisco
