<p> Jones head boys track and field coach Roland Rogers believes it will take a little strategy and stamina for the Falcons to regain their District 22-4A title . <p> With athletes limited to a maximum of three races and two field events , Rogers is n't sure exactly how to approach this week 's 22-4A meet , which concludes with the running finals at 5:30 p.m . Friday at Barnett Stadium . <p> " There are a lot of factors involved , " said Rogers , who led Jones to three straight titles from 1999-2001 before settling for second behind Sterling last year . " It depends on whether you want to sacrifice a kid in an individual event or put him in a relay , which is worth double points . I still do n't know what to do . " <p> Rogers said the size of 22-4A , which includes 10 schools , could make it even more complicated . Preliminaries were scheduled for earlier in the week . <p> " Because there are so many teams , we have to run preliminaries in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to have to run more races on only a day 's rest . They need to be in great shape . " <p> Rogers said this year 's district meet figures to be highly competitive , with several teams in the hunt . <p> " As always , Sterling has an outstanding team , Furr is running really well and Sharpstown is solid in the field events , " Rogers said . " It 's going to be extremely close . " <p> With several standouts with big-point potential , Jones will be in contention . <p> Senior Jeremiah Jackson is a former regional qualifier in the long jump and triple jump . Jackson has gone 22 feet , 10 inches and 44-7 , respectively , in those events . <p> Jackson has a legitimate shot at qualifying for state . <p> " Jeremiah has been to regionals three years in a row , " Rogers said . " He 's been in big meets before . He knows how to compete . " <p> Senior Marlon Jackson , a three-sport star who also excelled in football and basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson will try to qualify for regionals in the 100 and 200 meters after posting respective times of 10.5 and 21.5 . <p> " Marlon 's really dedicated himself to track , " Rogers said . " It 's only his second year running , but he 's come a long way . " <p> Junior Marvin Stone might be the top distance runner in 22-4A . Stone is the defending champion in the 1,600 and 3,200 . <p> " Marvin 's won three meets this year and was fourth in another , " Rogers said . " He 's been very consistent . " <p> Senior Craig Robicheaux captured the 800 last year in 2:20.69 and is one of the league 's premier half-milers . <p> Two relative newcomers - junior Marshall Taylor and senior Ervin Taylor - have made an impact . The Taylors , who are n't related , could score well in several races and a relay or two . <p> Marshall Taylor runs the 400 , while Ervin Taylor vies in the 110 and 300 hurdles . <p> " It 's their first year to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers said . <p> Senior Darnell Beller , a star on Jones ' 22-4A championship basketball team , will run the 800 and participate in the long and triple jumps . <p> " Darnell has n't run track in a while , but he 's run a 2:10 half-mile and jumped 20 feet ( in the long jump ) in his first meet , " Rogers said . " That 's not too shabby . " <p> Jones ' relays should be exciting , if not unpredictable . The Falcons will rely heavily on youngsters . <p> Freshman Remus Nembhard will join sophomores Courtney Neal , Brian Latham and Othella Bibbs on the 4x100 and 4x200 relays . That quartet posted a time of 43.5 while winning the junior varsity meet in the sprint relay last month . <p> " They also ran a 1:34 at the JV district meet ( in the 4x200 ) , " Rogers said . " Furr is the No. 1 team with a 1:31 . Our kids are n't far off that pace . " <p> The 4x400 relay likely will feature the Taylors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what our relays will look like , " said Rogers , whose freshmen and junior varsity teams won district again this year . <p> Rogers said he hopes to qualify a large group of athletes for the Class 4A , Region III meet April 25-26 at Bowers Stadium at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville . With a little luck , the Falcons might even send someone to state . <p> " It would be nice to take a kid to Austin , " Rogers said . " That 's the goal of every coach , but it depends on what happens at district and regionals . " <p> <p> St. Thomas <p> Aaron Cottrell did n't feel the need to change much when he took over as head track and field coach at St. Thomas . <p> Cottrell plans to follow the lead of his predecessor , Santiago Santos , who led the Eagles to their first Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools Class 5A track championship . <p> " We 've got pretty much the same kids , and the coaching staff is intact , " Cottrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we stay healthy and everyone performs up to their capabilities . " <p> St. Thomas has done well in early-season competition . The Eagles finished sixth or better in every meet , with the exception of the Highlander Invitational at The Woodlands . <p> They won a tri-meet with Bellaire and St. John 's , placed third at the St. John 's Rebel Relays and were third at the St. Thomas Eagle Relays . <p> " We 've had some quality results , but we have n't hit our stride , " said Cottrell , whose team will try to defend its title at the TAPPS District 3-5A meet at home on April 23 . That 's the final meet before the TAPPS State Championships May 2-3 at Baylor University in Waco . <p> Senior Cyd Robinson has probably been the most improved athlete on the squad . Robinson , who ran on several relays at state in 2002 , was clocked in 49.5 seconds in the 400 meters during the recent TSU Relays . <p> " Cyd 's time is already two seconds faster than the winning time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a kid who has continued to get stronger and faster . We 're expecting big things from him . " <p> Robinson also vies in the 200 and could medal at state in that race , in addition to competing in the long jump . <p> But the biggest threat at state is senior Gavin Fleming , who can earn medals in no less than four events . <p> Fleming came up big at last year 's meet . He was third in the 110 hurdles ( 15.74 ) , third in the high jump ( 6 feet ) , fourth in the long jump ( 20-9 ) and fourth in the pole vault ( 13-6 ) . <p> Already , Fleming has gotten better in every event . He 's lowered his time in the 110 hurdles ( 14.7 ) , cleared 6-5 in the high jump , gone 21-6 in the long jump and soared 14-3 in the pole vault . <p> " Gavin could be the high-point man at state , " Cottrell said . " He could be top three in every event and win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean heavily on senior Geoff Bennett , another multi-event standout . Bennett was a state champion last year in the 110 hurdles ( 14.99 ) and triple jump ( 44-4 1/2 ) and was a silver medalist in the 300 hurdles ( 40.93 ) . <p> The only thing that could hold Bennett back is a nagging injury . <p> " Geoff has a stress fracture at the end of football that finally is healed , " Cottrell said . " Hopefully , he 'll be at 100 percent for district and state . " <p> Cottrell said Bennett will need to be on top of his form this spring . <p> " From what I understand , hurdles probably will be the toughest races at state , " Cottrell said . " El Paso Cathedral has a great kid , and there are several other fast ones in TAPPS . " <p> Senior Billy Kana is another veteran from last year 's state championship group . Kana was a bronze medalist in the 300 hurdles ( 41.24 ) and also finaled in the 110 hurdles . <p> " Billy won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " Cottrell said . " He 's been impressive so far . " <p> Senior Aaron Damian also is a St. Thomas athlete who could score . Damian was third in the 100 ( 11.65 ) and seventh in the 200 ( 24.06 ) at state in 2002 . <p> " Aaron 's one of our best sprinters and an important part of our relays , " Cottrell said . <p> Senior Andrew Locke , a record-setting quarterback in football , is another quality athlete . But Locke , who was second in the pole vault ( 14-0 ) last year , wo n't be available for a few weeks . He is traveling in Europe as a member of the under-19 U.S. national rugby team . <p> " Andrew will miss a month or so , but he 's such a great athlete , I 'm not worried , " Cottrell said . <p> Junior Michael Rozelle has gone 13-6 in the pole vault and should uphold St. Thomas ' tradition in that event . The Eagles managed a 1-2-4 finish last year en route to the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to my assistant coach , " said Cottrell of Nathan Labus , a former University of Houston star who coaches St. Thomas vaulters . " He gets those kids ready every year . " <p> While the pole vault is perhaps St. Thomas ' best event , the Eagles do have three relays that can hold their own with anyone in TAPPS . <p> St. Thomas won the 4x100 relay in 2002 . This year 's foursome of Kana , Damien , Bennett and Robinson has already run a 44.28 . <p> The 4x200 relay of Fleming , Robinson , Damian and Kana turned in a 1:32.2 at the Strake Jesuit Relays . <p> The 4x400 relay of Locke , junior Michael Pena , Fleming and Robinson could make it a sweep . <p> Other individuals who could deliver a few points at district and perhaps state are sophomore sprinter-jumper Elegy Etter , junior Jay Ambosy and senior Jack Shallock in the distance events and senior half-miler David Lynn . <p> " We 're not as powerful in the distance races , but we 're well-stocked in the sprints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
