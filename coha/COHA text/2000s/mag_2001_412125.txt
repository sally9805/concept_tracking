FREEDOM IS THE ULTIMATE WEAPON <p> Even the plight of enterprising killers can tell us something . In the summer of 401 B.C. , 10,700 Greek hoplite soldiers  --  infantrymen , heavily armed with spear , shield and body armor  --  were hired by Cyrus the Younger to help press his claim to the Persian throne . <p> The recruits were mostly battle-hardened veterans of the 27-year Peloponnesian War , mustered from throughout the Greek-speaking world . Many were murderous renegades and exiles . Both near-adolescents and the still-hale in late middle age enlisted for pay . Large numbers were unemployed and desperate for lucrative work as killers in the exhausted aftermath of the internecine war that had nearly ruined the Greek world . Yet there were also a few privileged students of philosophy and oratory in the ranks , who would march into Asia side by side these destitute mercenaries-aristocrats like Xenophon , student of Socrates , and Proxenus , the Boeotian general , as well as physicians , professional officers , would-be colonists and wealthy friends of Prince Cyrus . <p> After a successful eastward march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks smashed the royal Persian line at Cunaxa , north of Babylon . The price for destroying an entire wing of the Persian army was a single Greek hoplite wounded by an arrow . The victory of the Ten Thousand , however , was wasted when their employer , Cyrus , rashly pursued his brother , Artaxerxes , across the battle line and was cut down by the Persian imperial guard . <p> Suddenly confronted by a host of enemies and hostile former allies , stranded far from home without money , guides , provisions or the would-be king , lacking ample cavalry or missile troops , the orphaned Greek infantrymen nevertheless voted not to surrender . Instead , they prepared to fight their way back to the Greek world . That brutal trek northward to the shores of the Black Sea forms the centerpiece of Xenophon 's Anabasis ( " The March Up-Country " ) , the author himself one of the leaders of the retreating Ten Thousand . <p> Though surrounded enemies , their generals captured and beheaded , forced to traverse the contested lands of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain passes and waterless steppes , suffering frostbite , malnutrition and frequent sickness , the Greeks nevertheless reached the safety of the Black Sea largely intact , less than a year and a half after leaving home . They had routed every hostile Asian force in their way . Five out of six made it out alive , the majority of the dead lost not in battle , but in the high snows of Armenia . <p> During their ordeal , the Ten Thousand were dumbfounded by the Taochians , whose women and children jumped off high cliffs in a ritual mass suicide . They found the barbaric white-skinned Mossynoecians , who engaged in sexual intercourse openly in public , equally baffling . The Chalybians traveled with the heads of their slain opponents . Even the royal army of Persia appeared strange ; its pursuing infantry , sometimes whipped on by their officers , fled at the first onslaught of the Greek phalanx . <p> What ultimately strikes the reader of the Anabasis is not merely the courage , skill and brutality of the Greek army  --  which after all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but the vast cultural divide between the Ten Thousand and the brave tribes they fought . Where else in the Mediterranean would philosophers and students of rhetoric march in file alongside cutthroats to crash headlong into enemy flesh ? Where else would every man under arms feel equal to anyone else in the army-or at least see himself as free and in control of his own destiny ? What other army of the ancient world elected its own leaders ? And how could such a small force led by an elected committee navigate thousands of miles home amid thousands of hostile enemies ? <p> Technological superiority does not in itself explain the miraculous Greek achievement , although Xenophon at various places suggests that the Ten Thousand 's heavy bronze , wood and iron panoply was unmatched by anything found in Asia . There is no evidence either that the Greeks were by nature " different " from King Artaxerxes ' men . The later pseudoscientific notion that the Europeans were racially superior to the Persians was entertained by no Greeks of the time . Although they were mercenary veterans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more savage or warlike than other raiders and plunderers of the time ; much less were they kinder or more moral people than the Asian tribes they met . Greek religion did not put a high premium on turning the other cheek or on a belief that war per se was either abnormal or amoral . Differences in climate , geography and natural resources tell us equally little . In fact , Xenophon 's men could only envy the inhabitants of Asia Minor , whose arable land and natural wealth were in dire contrast to their poor soil back in Greece . Indeed , their leaders warned that any Greeks who stayed might become lethargic " Lotus-Eaters " in so wealthier a natural landscape . <p> The Anabasis makes it clear , however , that the Greeks fought much differently than their adversaries and that those unique characteristics of battle  --  a sense of personal freedom , superior discipline , matchless weapons , egalitarian camaraderie , individual initiative , constant tactical adaptation and flexibility , a preference for the shock battle of heavy infantry  --  were themselves the murderous dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed grew out of consensual government , equality among the middling classes , civilian audit of military affairs and politics apart from religion , freedom and individualism and rationalism . The ordeal of the Ten Thousand , when stranded and near extinction , brought out the polls that was innate in all Greek soldiers , who then conducted themselves on campaign precisely as civilians in their respective city-states . <p> In some form or another , the Ten Thousand would be followed by equally brutal European intruders on the rest of the world 's landscapes : Agesilaus and his Spartans , Chares the mercenary captain , Alexander the Great , Julius Caesar and centuries of legionary dominance , the Crusaders , Hernan Cortes , Portuguese explorers in Asiatic seas , British redcoats in India and Africa and scores of other thieves , buccaneers , colonists , mercenaries , imperialists and explorers . Most subsequent Western expeditionary forces were outnumbered and often deployed far from home . Nevertheless , they outfought their numerically superior enemies , and in varying degrees drew on elements of Western culture mercilessly to slaughter their opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , it is almost a truism that the chief military worry of a Western army was another Western army . Few Greeks were killed stopping the Persians at Marathon ; thousands died at Nemea and Coronea , where Greek fought Greek . The latter Persian Wars saw relatively few Greek deaths ; the Peloponnesian War was a bloodbath . Alexander himself killed more Europeans in Asia than did the hundreds of thousands of Persians under Darius III . The Roman Civil Wars nearly ruined the republic , in a way that even Hannibal had not . Waterloo , the Somme and Omaha Beach only confirm the holocaust that occurs when Westerner meets Westerner . <p> Indeed , the story of military dynamism in our world is ultimately an investigation into the prowess of Western arms . Some will find that assertion chauvinistic , or worse , and cite every exception from Thermopylae to Little Big Horn in refutation . The general public itself is mostly unaware of their culture 's singular and continuous lethality in arms . Yet for the past 2,500 years , there has been a peculiar practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fighting  --  that has made Europeans the most deadly soldiers in the history of civilization . <p> I am not interested here in whether European military culture is morally superior to , or far more wretched than , that of the non-West . The conquistadors , who put an end to human sacrifice and torture on the Great Pyramid in Mexico City , sailed from a society reeling from the Grand Inquisition and the ferocious Reconquista , and left a diseased and nearly ruined New World in their wake . I am also less concerned in ascertaining the righteousness of particular wars  --  whether a murderous Pizarro in Peru ( who calmly announced , " The time of the Inca is over " ) was better or worse than his murdering Inca enemies , whether India suffered enormously or benefited modestly from English colonization , or whether the Japanese had good cause to bomb Pearl Harbor or the Americans to incinerate Tokyo . My curiosity in this particular discussion is not with Western man 's heart of darkness , but with his ability to fight  --  specifically , how his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural practices that themselves seemingly have little to do with war . <p> Why should we concentrate on a few hours of battle and the fighting experience of the average soldier , and not on the epic sweep of wars , with their cargo of grand strategy , tactical maneuver and vast theater operations that so much better lend themselves to social and cultural exegesis ? Military history must never stray from the tragic story of killing , which is ultimately found only in battle . The culture in which militaries fight determines whether thousands of mostly innocent young men are alive or rotting after their appointed hour of battle . Abstractions like capitalism or civic militarism are hardly abstract at all when it comes to battle , but rather concrete realities . And those are what ultimately determined whether at Lepanto twenty-year-old Turkish peasants survived or were harpooned by the thousand , whether Athenian cobblers and tanners could return home in safety after doing their butchery at Salamis or were to wash up in chunks on the shores of Attica . <p> There is an inherent truth in battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly impossible to explain away the dead , or to suggest that abject defeat is somehow victory . Wars are the sum of battles , battles the tally of individual human beings killing and dying . As observers as diverse as Aldous Huxley and John Keegan have pointed out , to write of conflict is not to describe merely the superior rifles of imperial troops or the matchless edge of the Roman gladius , but ultimately the collision of a machine-gun bullet with the brow of an adolescent , or the carving and ripping of artery and organ in the belly of an anonymous Gaul . It is no accident that gifted writers of war  --  from Homer , Thucydides , Caesar , Victor Hugo and Leo Tolstoy to Stephen Runciman , James Jones and Stephen Ambrose  --  equate tactics with blood and strategy with corpses . How can we write of larger cultural issues that surround war without describing the way in which young men kill and die , without remembering how many thousands are robbed of their youth , their robust physiques turned into goo in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead to discover at all costs how the practice of government , science , law and religion instantaneously determines the fate of thousands on the battlefield  --  and why . During the 1990-91 Gulf War , the designer of an American smart bomb , the assembler in its plant of fabrication , the logistician who ordered , received , stockpiled and loaded it onto a jet , all functioned in a manner unlike their Iraqi opposites  --  if there were such exact counterparts  --  and so ensured that an innocent conscript in Saddam Hussein 's army would find himself blown to pieces with little chance to escape the attack , display heroism in his demise or kill the pilot who killed him . Why Iraqi adolescents were targets in the flashing video consoles of sophisticated American helicopters and not vice versa , or why GIs from icy Minnesota were better equipped to fight in the desert than recruits from nearby sweltering Baghdad , is mostly a result of cultural heritage , not military courage , much less an accident of geography or genes . War is ultimately killing . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In battle , the insidious and more subtle cultural institutions that heretofore were murky and undefined become stark and unforgiving . No other culture but the West could have brought such discipline , morale and sheer technological expertise to the art of killing as did the Europeans at the insanity of Verdun  --  a sustained industrial approach to slaughter unlike even the most horrific tribal massacre . No American Indian tribe or Zulu impi could have marshaled , supplied , armed  --  and have killed and replaced  --  hundreds of thousands of men for months on end , for the rather abstract political cause of a nation-state . The most gallant Apaches-murderously brave in raiding and skirmishing on the Great Plains  --  would have gone home after the first hour of Gettysburg . <p> By the same token , there was little chance that the American government in the darkest days of December 1941  --  Britain on the ropes , the Nazis outside Moscow , the Japanese in the air over Hawaii  --  would have ordered thousands of its own pilots to crash themselves into Admiral Yamamoto 's vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refineries . In battle alone we receive a glimpse of the larger reasons precisely why and how men kill and die . Those reasons are hard to disguise and harder still to ignore . CAPITALISM KILLS <p> A century ago , the British historian Sir Edward Creasy wrote of Alexander 's victory at Gaugamela that it " not only overthrew an Oriental dynasty , but established European rulers in its stead . It broke the monotony of the Eastern world by the impression of Western energy and superior civilization , even as England 's present mission is to break up the mental and moral stagnation of India and Cathay by pouring upon and through them the impulsive current of Anglo-Saxon commerce and conquest . " Nearly everything in that statement is false , except for one indisputable phrase : " Western energy . " England was in India , India not in England . Alexander 's brigands were hardly emissaries of culture and went east to loot and plunder , not to " civilize . " But they killed without dying because of a military tradition that for centuries prior had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although an army 's organization , discipline and arms can surely magnify or whittle down the martial spirit of a man , bravery nonetheless is a more universal human characteristic and so tells us little . Europeans were intrinsically no smarter or braver than the Africans , Asians and Native Americans whom they usually butchered . The Aztec warriors who were blown to bits by Corte 's cannon or the Zulus who were shattered by British Martini-Henry rifles at Rorke 's Drift may have been the most courageous fighters in the history of warfare . The brave American pilots who blew up the Kaga at Midway were no more gallant than the brave Japanese who were engulfed in its flames below . What trumps courage , however , is culture , which determines how militaries are armed , supplied , organized and disciplined . <p> Outwardly , whether Iraqis fight Iranians or Somalians battle Ethiopians , the world 's regular armies are now almost identical in their Western khaki , camouflage and boots . Companies , brigades and divisions  --  the successors to Roman military practice  --  are the global standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine guns have not evolved beyond American models ; and Asian jets have not incorporated new propulsion systems with a radically novel Korean or Cambodian way of producing thrust . If a Third World autocrat buys weapons from China , India , or Brazil , he does so only because these countries can copy and provide Western-designed weapons more cheaply than the West itself . Indigenous armies in Vietnam and Central America have had success against Europeans  --  but largely to the degree that they were supplied with automatic weapons , high explosives and ammunition produced to Western specifications . <p> Some critics of the idea of Western military predominance point to the easy transference of technology . American natives , they point out , became better shots than European settlers . Moroccans quickly mastered Portuguese artillery . But such arguments have the paradoxical effect of proving the opposite of what is intended : Englishmen were in the New World and selling guns to natives , not vice versa . Moroccans were not in Lisbon teaching Portuguese the arts of Islamic heavy gunnery . <p> The very question of Westernization has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no concept of " Easternization " within the armed forces of the West , at least in which entire Western cultures adopt wholesale the military practices and technology of the non-West . Meditation , religion and philosophy are not the same as industrial production , scientific research and technological innovation . It matters lit tie where a weapon was first discovered , but a great deal how it was mass-produced , constantly improved and employed by soldiers . <p> The critical point about firearms and explosives is not that they suddenly gave Western armies hegemony , but that such weapons were produced in quality and great numbers only in Western countries . That fact is ultimately explained by a long-standing Western cultural stance toward rationalism , free inquiry and the dissemination of knowledge , whose roots he in classical antiquity and are not specific to any particular period of European history . What is clear , however , is that once developed , the West , ancient and modern , placed far fewer religious , cultural and political impediments to natural inquiry , capital formation and individual expression than did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasties or tribal unions . <p> But there is also something radically democratic about firearms in particular that explains their singularly explosive growth in the West . Guns destroy the hierarchy of the battlefield , marginalizing the wealthy mailed knight and rendering even the carefully trained bowman ultimately irrelevant . It is no accident that feudal Japan eventually found firearms revolutionary and dangerous . The Islamic world never developed the proper tactics of shooting in massed volleys , to accompany weapons that were so antithetical to the idea of personal bravery of the mounted warrior . The effective use of guns requires the marriage of rationalism and capitalism to ensure steady improvement in design , fabrication and production , but in addition an egalitarian tradition that welcomes rather than fears the entrance of lethal newcomers on the battlefield . <p> The dramatic European expansion of the 16th century may well have been energized by Western excellence in firearms and capital ships , but those discoveries were themselves the product of a long-standing Western approach to applied capitalism , science and rationalism not found in other cultures . <p> We should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Greek democracy , English parliamentary government ; or in the agora , Wall Street . The freedom that was won at Salamis is not entirely the same as what was ensured at Midway , much less as what was at stake at Lepanto or Tenochtitlan . All ideas are in part captives of their time and space , and much of ancient Greece today would seem foreign if not nasty to most Westerners . The polis would never have crafted a Bill of Rights ; in the same manner , we would not turn our courts over to majority vote of mass juries without the right of appeal to a higher judiciary . The key is not to look to the past and expect to see the present , but to identify in history the seeds of change , and of the possible across time and space . Wall Street is much closer to the agora than to the palace at Persepolis . The Athenian court akin to us in a way pharaoh 's and the sultan 's law is not . POLITICS BY BLOODIER MEANS <p> The Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so amoral-rarely shackled by concerns of ritual , tradition , religion or ethics , by anything other than military necessity . Western technology and science has not always been superior  --  Themistocles ' triremes at Salamis were no better than Xerxes ' , and Admiral Nagumo 's carriers at Midway had better planes than the Americans did . The status of freedom , individualism and civic militarism at those battles , however , was vastly different . And on nearly every occasion , it was not merely the superior weapons of European soldiers , but a host of other factors  --  organization , discipline , morale , initiative , flexibility and command  --  that led to Western advantages . <p> Western armies often fight with and for a sense of legal freedom . They are frequently products of civic militarism or constitutional governments , and thus are overseen by those outside religion and the military itself . Heavy infantry is also a particularly Western strength  --  not surprising when Western societies put a high premium on property , and land is often held by a wide stratum of society . Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and borrow inventions when in the marketplace of ideas their own traditional tactics and arms have been found wanting . Western capitalists and scientists alike have been singularly pragmatic and utilitarian , with little to fear from religious fundamentalists , state censors or stern cultural conservatives . <p> Western warring is often an extension of the idea of state politics , rather than a mere effort to obtain territory , personal status , wealth or revenge . Western militaries put a high premium on individualism . They are often subject to criticism and civilian complaint that may improve rather than erode their war-making ability . The idea of annihilation , of head-to-head battle that destroys the enemy , seems a particularly Western concept , largely unfamiliar to the ritualistic fighting and emphasis on deception and attrition found outside Europe . Westerners , in short , long ago saw war as a method of doing what politics can not , and thus are willing to obliterate rather than check or humiliate any who stand in their way . <p> At various periods in Western history the above menu has not always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious tolerance are often ideal rather than modal values . Throughout most of Western civilization there have been countless compromises , as what was attained proved less than what Western culture professed as the most desirable . The Crusaders were religious zealots ; many early European armies were monarchical , with only occasional oversight by deliberative bodies . It is hard to see in Cortes 's small band religion and politics as entirely separate . Not a phalangite in Alexander 's army voted him general , much less king . German tribesmen were ostensibly as individualistic as Roman legionaries . <p> Yet , abstract ideas must often be seen in the context of their times : while Alexander 's Macedonians were revolutionaries who had destroyed Greek liberty , there was no escaping their ties with the Hellenic tradition . That shared heritage explains why soldiers in the phalanx , commanders in the fields and generals at Alexander 's table all voiced their ideas with a freedom unknown in the Achaemenid court . While the Inquisition was an episode of Western fanaticism and at times unrestrained by political audit , the tally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corpses in a mere four days at the Great Temple to Huitzilopochtli in 1487 . Even on the most controversial of issues like freedom , consensual government and dissent , we must judge Western failings not through the lenses of utopian perfectionism of the present , but in the context of the global landscape of the times . Western values are absolute , but the methods of their implementation are also evolutionary , being perfect at neither their birth nor their adolescence . <p> I am not suggesting that the intrinsic characteristics of Western civilization predetermined European success on every occasion . Rather , Western civilization gave a spectrum of advantages to European militaries that allowed them a much greater margin of error and the ability to overcome tactical deficiencies  --  battlefield inexperience , soldierly cowardice , insufficient numbers , terrible generalship . Luck , individual initiative and courage , the brilliance of a Hannibal or Saladin , the sheer numbers of Zulu or Inca warriors  --  all on occasions could nullify Western inherent military superiority . Over time , however , the resiliency of the Western system of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Big Horn not to affect the larger course of the conflict or to lead to an overall Western collapse . THE LETHAL EDGE <p> There was no idea of personal freedom in the Pharaoh 's ranks ; no Persian conception of civic militarism or civilian audit of the Great King 's army ; no Thracian embrace of the scientific tradition ; no disciplined files of shock phalangites in Phoenicia ; and no landed infantry of small property owners in ancient Scythia-and thus no military in the ancient Mediterranean like the Greeks at Thermopylae , Salamis , or Plataea . By the same token , Montezuma could not envision fighting in the Mediterranean , just as Ali Pasha would never see the Americas . There was little chance that the Aztecs , for all their rich local natural resources , on their own accord could make harquebuses , gunpowder or crossbows , the Ottomans topflight bronze cannon and the Zulus Martini-Henry rifles . Japan learned to its advantage in the nineteenth century that Europe alone could design battleships  --  and that battleships were superior to anything that floated in the Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribal spears of their own past . <p> Western military power , however , is more than superior technology . Just as the peace movement and the constant political audit of the military in Vietnam conditioned the behavior of American armies in Southeast Asia , so Bishop Colenso and his family published critiques against the British invasion of Zululand . Bernardino de Sahagun 's narrative of the Spanish conquest of Mexico sought to criticize the morality of his countrymen 's army  --  in a way unthinkable in Aztec , Vietnamese or Zulu society . It is no accident that Themistocles , like both the victorious Cortes and Lord Chelmsford , did not die a hero in a homeland grateful to him for the slaughter of its enemies . Did such dissent weaken consistently Westerners ' ability to wage war ? Not always , at least not in the long term . The Western tradition of critique and audit has not only established European credibility , and so served to ensure that the written and published story of war was largely Western ; it has also shown that minds outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure and manhood were spent , sometimes saving the military from itself . <p> Wars are fought by men who are fickle , and in real conditions that are wholly unpredictable  --  heat , ice and rain , tropical and neararctic , close and far from home . Western armies in Africa , Asia and the Americas , like soldiers everywhere , were often annihilated  --  often led by fools and placed in the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time . But Themistocles , Alexander the Great , Cortes and the British and American officers of the last two centuries enjoyed innate advantages that over the long duration could offset imbecilic generalship , flawed tactics , strained supply lines , difficult terrain and inferior numbers  --  or a simple " bad day . " These advantages were not the product of the genes , germs or geography , of a distant past . The Zulu empire was doomed once the British decided to invade , regardless of its victory at Isandhlwana , despite the tactical lapses of Lord Chelmsford and irrespective of courageous impis . <p> Discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western elections and constitutions are not the same as tribal freedom , in which much land and few people occasionally give individuals opportunity to find solitude and independence . The desire to fight as freemen is also different from the simple elan of defenders who expel tyrants and foreign powers from their homeland . Persians , Aztecs , Zulus and North Vietnamese all wished to be free of foreign troops on their native soil , but they fought for the autonomy of their culture  --  not as free voting citizens with rights protected by constitutions . A Zulu could roam relatively free on the plains of southern Africa , enjoying a somewhat more " free " lifestyle than a British redcoat in a stuffy barracks ; but the Zulu , not the Englishman , was subject to execution by a nod of his king . Shaka proved this tens of thousands of times over . North Vietnamese communists duplicitously promised to their troops a Western style " democratic republic "  --  not a communist police state or a feudal dynasty . <p> All armies at times engage in mass confrontations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to advance head-on in shock collisions . Likewise , armies from the Persians to the Ottomans often developed sophisticated methods of mustering troops ; none outside the West drafted fighters with the implicit understanding that their military service was part and parcel of their status as free citizens who determined when , how and why they were to go to war . Foot soldiers are common in every culture , but infantrymen , fighting en masse , who take and hold ground and fight face-to-face , are a uniquely Western specialty  --  the product of a long tradition of a middling landholding citizenry , uneasy with both landless peasants and mounted aristocrats . <p> Africans and American Indians could employ European rifles , become crack shots and occasionally repair broken stocks and barrels . Yet they could not produce guns in any great number , if at all , much less craft improved models , or find in a written literature the abstract principles of ballistics and munitions , in order to conduct advanced research . <p> Similarly , buying and selling is a human trait ; the abstract protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the understanding of markets are not . Capitalism is more than the sale of goods , more than the existence of money and more than the presence of the bazaar . Rather , it is a peculiar Western practice that acknowledges the self-interest of man and channels that greed to the production of vast amounts of goods and services , through free markets and institutionalized guarantees of personal profit , free exchange , deposited capital and private property . <p> And lastly , every army possesses men of daring , but few encourage initiative throughout the ranks and welcome rather than fear innovation  --  so apprehensive are they that an army of independent-thinking soldiers just might prove the same as citizens . Bickering among soldiers and disagreement among a small cadre of generals  --  whether Hitler 's captains or Aztec lords  --  are universal traits . But the institutionalization of critique in the military  --  soldiers ' subservience to political leaders , existence of law courts , uniform codes of discipline subject to review , appeal and ratification  --  is unknown outside the West . The freedom among citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedigree outside the European tradition . <p> Will  --  and should  --  this lethal heritage continue ? In a series of border wars from 1947 to 1982 , tiny Israel fought and decisively defeated a loose coalition of its Arab neighbors , who were supplied with sophisticated weapons by the Soviet Union , China and France . Israel 's population during those decades never exceeded five million , whereas its surrounding antagonists  --  at various times including Syria , Egypt , Lebanon , Jordan , Iraq and the Gulf states  --  numbered well over 100 million . Despite nearly indefensible borders , the outnumbered Israeli army  --  the creation of a brilliant generation of European emigres  --  consistently fielded better-organized , - supplied and - disciplined armies , with superbly trained and individualistic soldiers . Israel itself was a democratic society of free markets , free elections and free speech . Its enemies simply were not . <p> In less than three months in 1982 , a British expeditionary force crossed 8,000 miles of rough seas and expelled a well-entrenched Argentine army on the Falklands , which was easily supported by ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away .

Again , the democratic and capitalist society of the United Kingdom sent out better-trained and more disciplined combatants in this strange little war , soldiers far different from those fielded by the Argentine dictatorship . <p> On January 17 , 1991 , a coalition of U.S. allies defeated the veteran army of Iraq  --  l.2 million ground troops , 3,850 artillery pieces , 5,800 tanks , 5,100 other armored vehicles  --  in four days , at a loss of fewer than 150 American servicemen and - women , most of whom were killed by random missile attack , friendly fire or other accidents .

Not a single soldier who was incinerated by American jets voted to invade Kuwait or fight the United States .

Iraq 's military hardware  --  from poison gas to tanks and mines  --  was all imported . Any Iraqi journalist who questioned the wisdom of invading Kuwait was likely to end up like Pythius the Lydian on the eve of Xerxes ' invasion of Greece .

THE FUTURE OF FIGHTING <p> Nothing that has transpired in the last decades of the twentieth century suggests an end to Western military dominance , much less to war itself . Had the United States unleashed its full arsenal of brutal military power and fought without political restrictions , the war in Vietnam would have been over in a year or two , and may well have resembled the lopsided affair in the Gulf War . The terrorist attack on Sept. 11  --  accomplished through Western technology , from pilot lessons and cell phones to frequent-flyer miles and the Internet  --  will be answered by a degree of leathal power simply unimagined and incomprehensible in the Middle East . <p> There are three often-discussed military scenarios for the future : no wars , occasional wars or a single , world-ending conflict .

Contemporary wars are not merely frequent , but often brutal beyond anything in the nineteenth century . The 1991 Gulf War drew down the might of the United States to its National Guard reserves , a state of mobilization rarely reached even during the worst crises of the Cold War .

The rise of a huge federal government and global corporations has reduced the number of Americans who work as autonomous individuals  --  as family farmers , small businesspeople or owners of local shops . Freedom for many means an absence of responsibility , while the culture of the mall , video and Internet seem to breed uniformity and complacence , rather than rationalism , individualism and initiative . <p> Will the West always , then , possess persons of the type who fought at Midway , or who rowed for their freedom at Salamis , or who rushed to reform their battered legions in the aftermath of Can nae ? Pessimists see seeds of decay in the lethargic teenagers of affluent American suburbs . But I am not so sure we are yet at the point of collapse . As long as Europe and America retain constitutional government , capitalism , freedom of religious and political association , free speech and intellectual tolerance , then history teaches us that Westerners in their hour of need can still field brave , disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet . Our institutions , if they do not erode entirely , can survive periods of decadence brought on by our material success , eras when the whole notion of civic militarism seems bothersome , and in which free speech is used to focus on our own imperfections without concern for the ghastly nature of our enemies . The fumes of Roman republicanism kept the empire going long after the ideal of a citizen soldier sometimes gave way to a mercenary army . <p> Nor is a second scenario likely either  --  total war brought on by a nuclear America , Europe , Russia , China or a warlike Islamic world that would incinerate the planet . Two colossal enemies  --  the Soviet Union and America  --  did not employ their huge nuclear arsenals through fifty years of the Cold War . There is no reason to think that either is more rather than less bellicose after the fall of communism . Their legacy to others is nuclear restraint , not recklessness . Strategic arsenals , both nuclear and biological , are shrinking , not growing . Defensive systems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ability to shield blows is a law of military history , forgotten though it has been in the last half century of threatened nuclear Armageddon . The swing is once more toward the defensive , as vast sums are allocated to missile protection , to counterinsurgency and even to body armor to deflect bullet , shrapnel and flame . <p> Any nation in this new century that threatens the use of the atomic bomb realizes that it is faced with two unpleasant alternatives : massive reprisal in kind , and soon the possibility that its use will be deflected or destroyed before harming its adversary . Prudence in the use of nuclear weapons , not profligacy , remains the protocol in hot and cold wars . Plague , nerve gas and new viruses not yet imagined , we are told , will some day kill us all . But military historians will answer that the forces of vigilance , keen border defense , technologies of prevention and vaccination and counterintelligence are also never static . Deterrence draws on a human , not a culturally specific , phenomenon : even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rogue state that sponsors a terrorist with a vial in Manhattan is still cognizant that its own continued existence is measured by a 15-minute missile trajectory . Such nightmarish realities of war lurk beneath the surface of our current crisis . <p> If we are to have neither perpetual peace nor a single conflagration to end the species , the third option  --  random and even deadlier conventional wars  --  seems a certainty . We in the West still shudder at the carnage of World War II , largely because it took the lives of so many Westerners . We forget that in the half century since the end of Hitler 's Germany , far more Koreans , Chinese , Africans , Indians and Southeast Asians have died in mostly forgotten tribal wars , at the hands of their own governments or in hot spots of the Cold War . <p> In this regard , the future of Western warfare looks somewhat more disturbing  --  so many have perished due to the diffusion of Western arms . The most obvious worry is the continual spread of Western notions of military discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanying womb of freedom , civic militarism , civilian audit and dissent . Those semi-Western autocracies now on the horizon  --  China , North Korea , Iran  --  may soon , through the purchase or the promotion of a Western-trained scientific and military elite , gain the capability nearly to match European and American weapons research and development , without any sense of affinity with  --  indeed , with abject hostility to  --  their original mentors . Just as deadly as satellite guidance systems in China is a Chinese chain of command with a flexibility and initiative modeled after that in Europe and America , and a private rather than state-owned munitions industry . <p> In these new flash points to come , can the non-West import our weaponry and organization and doctrine ? Can a capitalist China , Iran , Vietnam or Pakistan equip and organize a sophisticated army , superior to any Western military , without free citizens , individualism in command hierarchy and constant oversight of its strategy and tactics ? Or do such would-be antagonists merely pick the fruit of the West , which soon withers without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will they win occasional battles but not wars ? Or threaten us endlessly with the specter of nuclear-tipped missiles over Los Angeles ? <p> A military command may steal secrets daily over the Internet , but if it can not discuss those ideas openly with its civilian and military leadership , then there is no guarantee that such information will find its optimum application . And should our present adversaries adopt consensual government , free speech and market economies , would they then really remain our adversaries ? Perhaps , perhaps not . But the question is not the only one of relevance , for there is no guarantee now  --  nor was there ever  --  that the West itself is always stable , not prone to turn its lethal arsenal upon itself . States that become thoroughly Western are less likely to attack the traditional West , but not less likely enough to ensure that they never will . The horror of organized warfare throughout history has not been constant fighting between tribal societies  --  or even , between the West and " the Other "  --  but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the world becomes thoroughly Western , the larger the Europeanized battlefield shall become . WEST ON WEST <p> With the worldwide spread of democracy , capitalism , free speech , individualism and a globally connected economy , it may be that world-encompassing wars will be less likely . Yet it will also be true that when wars do break out , they will be far more lethal , and draw on the full resources of a deadly military tradition . We see glimpses of that today  --  tribal fights in which hideous Western weapons are used by those who have not a clue how to create them . <p> The peril to come , however , is not just the spread of atomic weapons and F-16 fighters but much more so the dissemination of rationalism and knowledge  --  the real ingredients of a most murderous brand of battle . Most see in the advance of capitalism , democracy and their ancillary values the seeds of perpetual peace and prosperity . Maybe , but we must remember that these ideas have also been the foundations for the world 's deadliest armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , is not Western moral decline or the threat of the Other  --  now polished with the veneer of sophisticated arms . It is the age-old specter of horrendous war inside the West itself . Gettysburg in a single day took more Americans than did all the Indian wars of the nineteenth century . A small Boer force killed more British troops in six days than the Zulus did in a year . Most of the crises that have plagued the world in the twentieth century grew out of Europe 's two world wars  --  the status of Germany , the division and unification of Europe , the rise and collapse of the Russian empire , the spread of communism after the defeat of fascism , the mess in the Balkans . <p> Many have accepted the truism that democracies do not fight democracies . Statistics seem to support this encouraging belief . But there is little margin of error , given the carnage and cultural chaos even a single intramural European war can bring . Consensual governments , in fact , have often fought other Western consensual governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 415 B.C. A century later , Democratic Boeotia fought democratic Athens at Mantinea . Italian republics of the Renaissance were constantly at each other 's throat . Revolutionary France and parliamentary England were deadly enemies ; a democratic United States fought twice against the consensual government of Britain . There was a Union and a Confederate president and Senate . The Boers and the British in southern Africa each elected representatives . Elected prime ministers have not pacified India and Pakistan . The presence of a Palestinian parliament has not brought peace to the Middle East . The Russian entry into Chechnya received parliamentary approval . <p> Western fratricide , as it has in the past , threatens an entire civilization , which for good or evil has given the world industrialization , technological advance , popular culture and blueprints for political organization . We should be apprehensive that there are once again fundamental upheavals transpiring in Europe , more so that at any time since the 1930s . The growth in influence of a unified Germany has scarcely begun . The specter of a pan-European state highlights the increasing ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among its members by collective antagonism toward and envy of the United States . The insecurity of eastern Europe is part of a larger dilemma facing a Russia neither quite European nor Asian . The pride and fears of a Westernized Japan remain , accentuated by the rise of a capitalist China and the unpredictability of the two Koreas , who themselves promise a new unified nationalist identity  --  per haps fueled by South Korean capitalism and North Korean nuclear arms . <p> I worry less for the millennium to come about constant warring between the West and non-West . Has not the real danger to progress and civilization always arisen when the West turns its deadly arsenal upon itself ? . If so , let us pray for another half century of aberrant European and American peace , for a few more decades of good behavior , so at odds with the West 's own past . But let us remember as well that the more Western the world becomes , the more likely that its wars will be ever more Western in nature , and thus ever more deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , and that could be a very dangerous thing indeed . Culture is not a mere construct , but when it comes to war , a very deadly reality that often determines whether thousands of mostly innocent young men and women live or die . <p> Western civilization has given mankind the only economic system that works ; a rationalist tradition that alone allows us material and technological progress ; the sole political structure that ensures the freedom of the individual ; a system of ethics and a religion that brings out the best in humankind ; and the most lethal practice of arms conceivable . Let us hope that we at last understand this legacy . It is a weighty and sometimes ominous heritage that we must neither deny nor feel ashamed about  --  but insist that our deadly manner of war serves , rather than buries , our civilization . <p> ( * ) and will <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Greeks versus Persians , at Issues , 333 B.C.
