Svetlana Ishmouratova of Russia capitalized on mistakes by all the favorites . Teammate Olga Pyleva was second . A strong finish by Germany 's Martina Glagow bumped Russia 's Albina Akhatova to fourth place . Ishmouratova 's time included a one-minute penalty for her one missed target in 20 shots . Pyleva also missed one shot but finished 45.5 seconds behind Ishmouratova . Glagow 's teammates were expected to dominate , and Andrea Henkel was in line to defend the gold medal she won in 2002 until she missed two targets on her final shoot .
