Amber Rose wanted out of the con-artist life . Counting cards in Vegas high-stakes poker games was not the way she wanted to live  --  even if it did bring in money she desperately needed to pay for her Alzheimer's-stricken father 's medical bills and keep him in a top-notch nursing home . But now she 'd saved enough to find another way . She glanced around the crowded , smoke-filled casino , where she 'd arranged to meet Marshall Banks , her soon-to-be ex-partner . The Bellagio was his favorite hotel on the Strip and she hoped the atmosphere would put him in a good mood for when she delivered the news . <p> Amber glanced at her watch . Though it felt like hours , only five minutes had passed since she 'd arrived . Relax , she ordered herself , when she finally caught sight of Marshall across the room . <p> She could n't help but notice many appreciative female eyes followed him as he cut through the crowd . With his black slacks and colorful striped dress shirt , and dark , slicked-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal . Women had always been drawn to Marshall . As a young , impressionable teenager , Amber had been one of them . How could she not have a crush on her father 's top protTgT ? <p> Sam Brenner had been a gambler extroaordinaire , a man Amber had been in awe of . He was everything Vegas  --  big and large , dynamic and exciting . He 'd adored his daughter and he 'd seen to it she had everything she 'd ever needed . Since he was often traveling the gambling circuit , leaving Amber with his parents , she 'd extended her awe and love to her dashing father to her hometown , Vegas . She reveled in the glitz and glamour that emanated from it in waves . <p> The shine had long since come off Marshall , though , and these days she saw her soon-to-be ex-partner for the man he really was . A middle-aged con who made his living by gambling and cheating , simply because he could . Amber 's reasons for getting into the life had been less self-serving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their partnership . <p> " Hey , beautiful . " Marshall stepped up beside her and pressed a cool kiss to her cheek . " How are you this morning ? " he asked , interrupting her introspection . <p> " I 'm just fine . " She pressed her fingers together to keep from fidgeting or tipping her hand before she was ready . <p> " Can I get you a drink ? " Marshall asked . <p> She frowned at his question . " Is n't noon a little early for cocktails ? " <p> " Come on , babe , relax . It 's Friday . The start of the weekend . " He flagged down a waitress . " Johnnie Walker Black for me . And a chardonnay for the lady . " <p> Chardonnay was Amber 's drink of choice when she and Marshall were acting the part of gambler and his bimbo . Amber did n't want anything to do with the charade now . <p> She waved her hand in the air . " Nothing for me . " <p> With a nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall immediately cocked his head to one side . " Something wrong ? " he asked Amber . <p> She shook her head . " No , it 's just that it 's awfully early in the day . " Even for a Friday . <p> He pinned her with his astute stare . " What 's your problem ? You usually do n't give a damn what I drink or when as long as we have a gig planned that 'll bring in some cash . And I already told you we 're set for tomorrow night . Relax . " He reached out a hand to smooth her long curls . <p> She forced herself to release a calming breath . He was right . She 'd never questioned him about his drinking before . From the moment she 'd asked him to join her in her mission to raise big money by revisiting the tricks her father had taught her in her youth , she 'd always let him do his own thing . Amber did n't want him drinking now because the more alcohol he downed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . <p> She might as well get it over with . " About tomorrow 's game . " Amber clenched and unclenched her fists . Her palms were damp and she resisted the urge to wipe them on her dark dress . <p> His wary gaze turned his irises coal-black , but Amber was n't afraid . He usually possessed enough charm to cover his explosive temper . Usually . <p> " What 's wrong ? " he asked again . <p> " I wo n't be there . " <p> " That 's a bad joke . " He frowned , the scowl marring his features . " You know I ca n't win without that photographic memory of yours . What could be more important than the game ? " <p> How to explain honesty , morality and guilt to a man who did n't worry about those things ? Amber bit the inside of her cheek , wondering how to phrase things so he 'd understand . <p> She met Marshall 's unnerving gaze . " I 'm not coming tomorrow because I 'm finished with card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always loved the highs and challenges that high-stakes gambling offered , but she also needed to like the person she viewed in the mirror each morning . And she had , until she was forced to leave the career she loved to look after her father . As a concierge in Beverly Hills , Amber had had a legitimate job that offered her enough challenge to satisfy her reckless streak . She 'd found the best in life and she wanted it back . And since she 'd saved enough money to take time and find another way to pay for her father 's care , she intended to do just that . <p> " Finished ? Come on , baby . Be real . " Marshall laughed from deep in his chest as his eyes wandered over her . " Like I just said , we 're a team , you and I. " <p> " Not anymore . " At twenty-four years old , she 'd learned that she preferred to come by her excitement honestly . <p> " Oh , really ? " He folded his arms across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buying one word . " Where else are you going to get the tax-free cash to pay for that fancy place your old man is in ? " He leaned in closer as he spoke . <p> The suddenly too-strong scent of his distinctive cologne assaulted her senses and she pulled back . " That 's my problem , not yours . I 'm just telling you our days as partners are over . I 'm out . " <p> " The hell you are . " He grabbed her arm tight . <p> She shook him off and shot him a deadly look . " Do not touch me like that again . Ever . " She rubbed her sore arm . " I 've made my decision and nothing you say or do is going to change my mind . " <p> " Sorry , babe . I have too much riding on tomorrow night to indulge you , " he said through gritted teeth . He took a step toward her , clearly intending to scare her into changing her mind . <p> No sooner had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside them . " Is something wrong here ? " <p> Amber jerked toward the sound of the sexy male voice and was literally blown away . Good-looking was too mild a word to describe the dark-haired stranger whose gaze bore into hers with genuine concern . <p> " Everything 's fine . " Amber did n't want this man to get into an argument with Marshall , who seemed primed for a fight . As long as they were in public , her ex-partner would n't do more than make a show of manhandling her . <p> " Does n't look fine to me . " The stranger deliberately stared at Marshall 's hand on her arm . <p> Amber would have shoved Marshall away , but she knew she 'd only set him off and cause more trouble for the stranger who seemed determined to play white knight . <p> " I do n't see what business it is of yours , " Marshall said , all bluster and machismo . <p> " I 'm making it my business . " Her rescuer shoved his hand into his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I heard the lady ask you to keep your hands to yourself . So either you 're deaf or just plain stupid . Care to tell me which ? " He shoved the small leather billfold back into his pocket just as fast . <p> Marshall immediately released his grip on Amber 's arm . " Hey , no harm , " he said , raising his hands in a gesture of surrender as he took a step back . <p> " Really ? " The other man squared his shoulders , which seemed to grow broader beneath his navy T-shirt . " Why do n't we ask the lady if that 's true . Did he hurt you ? " His caring voice softened as he spoke to her , wrapping around her like a warm caress . <p> She met his gaze . " I 'm fine now . " She bit the inside of her cheek to keep from saying anything that might incite more trouble between the men . <p> Marshall nodded in agreement . " See ? Just a lover 's quarrel . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be further from the truth . Her goal had been to extricate herself from Marshall . She was n't about to let him pull her back in . Or lead her sexy savior to the wrong conclusion about them . <p> She shook her head . " Actually we areI mean , we were business partners . But we are n't anymore , " she said . <p> The stranger 's blue eyes narrowed . " Then I guess there 's nothing left to discuss , is there ? " he pointedly asked Marshall , dismissing him . <p> Marshall shifted on his feet . <p> Amber knew no one could make him leave if he wanted to stay , but the stranger had flashed a badge . <p> So Marshall turned away , but not before sending Amber a warning glance . <p> He was n't finished with her yet . <p> Michael Corwin watched the dirtbag walk away , making sure the other man left the casino before turning his gaze toward the beautiful woman he could n't help but rescue . <p> " Are you really okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . A cascade of blond curls fell over her shoulder as she glanced at him . " I 'll live , " she said wryly . " I could have handled Marshall myself . But thank you for stepping in . " Appreciation and what looked like admiration glittered in her clear blue eyes . <p> As a detective , it was in his nature to be protective , but as a man he 'd been drawn to the alluring woman who 'd obviously needed his help . " You 're welcome . " <p> She studied him intently . " You are n't a Las Vegas cop , are you ? " <p> He raised an eyebrow at her astute observation . " Boston , Massachusetts . What makes you ask ? " <p> " The accent clearly says you are n't a local . Marshall would have realized it himself if he 'd been composed enough to breathe . " She extended her hand . " I 'm Amber . Pleased to meet you . " <p> " Mike Corwin . " He shook her hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling right in his groin . Unexpected , but not unwanted , he thought . " Do you have a last name , Amber ? " <p> " It 's Rose . Amber Rose . " <p> He raised an eyebrow at the exotic-sounding name . Added to the short black cocktail dress that draped her slender body , revealing ample cleavage for such a slight woman , he had to admit she made for an enticing package . One he could n't ignore if he 'd wanted to . <p> He did n't . <p> " I know it 's an unusual name , " she added . <p> " Actually , I was going to say it sounds like it belongs to a Vegas showgirl . No insult intended . " <p> Her porcelain skin flushed beneath the tacky casino lighting . She grinned , showing off one dimple in her cheek . " You 're half-right . Rose was my mother 's maiden name . Celia Rose . She was a showgirl . " <p> " She 's retired ? " <p> A shadow passed over her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what brings you to Vegas ? " she asked , changing the subject as she looked down and noticed their still-intertwined hands . <p> He 'd been holding on , drawing lazy circles around her wrist with his thumb , enjoying the connection that felt so right , so fast . Obviously she did n't want to discuss her mother and he let the subject go . " I 'm here for a wedding . " <p> " Yours ? " She jerked her hand back , a horrified expression on her face . <p> " Hell , no , not my wedding . Do I look like the kind of guy who 'd hit on a woman if I was getting married ? " he asked , quickly setting things right . " It 's my partner 's . " <p> " Oh . " She exhaled hard . " So you are hitting on me ? " she asked , sounding extremely pleased at the notion . <p> " Most definitely . " He stepped closer . Despite the acrid smell of cigarette smoke in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately more aroused . " I 'm not married or involved , " he said , further reassuring her . <p> Her lips turned upward in a smile . <p> Any normal , red-blooded man would be attracted to her . Mike had worked so many hours lately , he could n't remember the last time he 'd gotten laid . He did n't normally go around picking up the women he rescued , but Amber was different . Sexual attraction was n't her only appeal . She was intelligent and obviously had morals  --  she 'd made it clear she would n't have been interested in him if he 'd been someone else 's husband . <p> He was here enjoying a long weekend before he had to be back in court early Monday morning to testify in a case he 'd closed last year . He 'd planned to have fun , unwind and celebrate with his friends . This woman was an unexpected bonus and he realized he wanted to do all of the above with her by his side . <p> He was n't normally so impulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas could a man indulge and not feel guilty ? If the desire was mutual . <p> " So . " She ran her tongue over her glossed lips . " What are you going to do now that you 've hit on me ? " she asked in a husky voice . <br> Continues ...
