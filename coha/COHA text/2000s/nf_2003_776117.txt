Cook 's maps // Despite the cold , a good many people stand about idly in Tower Hill , a broad and open space in the middle of a congested city , a place at once grand and squalid , depending on whether you glance towards the fine buildings along its western side , or the dunghill beside the ditch . The Tower of London itself is formidable , and most of those who stand about seem to be waiting on it , as visitors do . Now , early in the afternoon , on 14 December 1767 , a group of Dutch travellers , unostentatiously wealthy , gathers itself together and turns towards the gate , to pay sixpences and see the wild beasts and the jewels . They will find the lioness Dido extraordinary and the old stones dull . Others wait their turn . A couple of sharp men lean on the wooden rails before the ditch . They are there to look after visitors , if they have a chance , in their own way . Some naval officers emerge from Trinity House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners alike . Another man comes out of the same building and walks towards the postern-gate ; he has the look of someone who knows this part of the city without being of it ; he is from elsewhere , but is no foreigner . He is an oddly proportioned man , tall , with a small head and a pronounced nose . He walks a little oddly too , briskly enough , while planting his feet as if the stones were liable to sway . // He enters a bookseller like others - leather-bound volumes behind the display windows , and bills headed ' Today is published ... ' - yet in fact different to any other . The premises of Mount and Page are devoid of Latin poetry , sermons and treatises on taste . There are no political tracts , no novels , not even any pornography . Mount and Page are maritime publishers , the maritime publishers of the town . James Cook is comfortable , and not just because he is out of the cold . He does not own more than a dozen of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a few of them , and has at one time or another studied more than he can recall . He is in a library of his own accomplishment. // I do not know that Cook visited his printer , John Mount , on any particular day in late 1767 . But I do know that he must have visited on some occasion , probably several , around this time . And when he did visit , he would surely have browsed Mount 's stock , which included The Mariner 's New Kalender , The Seamen 's Daily Assistant , The Principles of Mr Harrison 's Time-Keeper and a formidable number of other works . He would surely also have chatted to Mount , who was in the thick of maritime gossip , who is likely to have heard that Cook had almost lost his ship , the Grenville , near the Nore a few weeks earlier . If the subject came up , Cook would have been embarrassed , but would have been obliged to explain that his vessel had struck a sandbank , that he had been unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship as best they could and headed for safety in her boats before venturing back the next day and refloating her . Not much had been lost , other than a canoe from Newfoundland that Cook had been asked to bring back for a gentleman naturalist , a man he did not know , one Mr Banks . Cook would no doubt have been keen to move the conversation on . Mount had published his Directions for Navigating on Part of the South Coast of Newfoundland ; Cook has now brought his sequel , describing the island 's west coast . He fishes the manuscript out of a bag . Mount - who maybe finds Cook 's spare prose strangely engaging , looks forward to marking up the script , seeing it set , seeing it printed - scans the pages . As he does so , Cook recalls his words and the places that his unliterary words have laboured to describe . Cape Anguille , St George 's Harbour , Long Point , Foxes Island , Foxes Tail , the river Humber , Bonne Bay , Keppell Island , Ingornachoix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and white cliffs and the salmon streams of that transatlantic summer come back to him . He remembers eating broiled cod on the beach with fishermen , fleeting moments with some Indians and the satisfying repetition of his exercises : putting out the flags , taking the angles , sounding the bottom , feeling the fine grey sand that came up off the bank . His Directions report the measurements rather than the meals or meetings , the passages , rocks and entrances , the bearings and distances and not the habitations and happenings . // Cook 's Directions were adjuncts to his charts . By 1767 he had been in the Royal Navy for twelve years . The first three or four had been samples of conventional naval experience . As was often the case during the eighteenth century , Britain and France were at war and Cook , like many others , joined cruises from Plymouth and Portsmouth into the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic , to harass French shipping . He 'd spent days inspecting rope and badgering men who were supposed to be repairing sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching seamen drinking with port women , and evenings with moronic midshipmen , who rattled dice and recited awful poetry . In late 1757 he joined the Pembroke and the following year that ship formed part of the north American fleet . Cook had a bit part in the Canadian campaign that culminated in the surrender of Quebec and the deaths of both generals , Wolfe and Montcalm , in September 1759 . It was along and around the coasts that made a sort of funnel into Quebec that he became less a conventional seaman and more a specialist in the arts of surveying . His chart of Gasp ? harbour , the site of some French settlements on the Gulf of St Lawrence , was engraved and printed for Mount and Page ; he did further work of the same sort between Quebec , Halifax and Newfoundland until the end of the summer of 1762 . That October he was in England , for the first time in almost five years . He made the time to get married to one Elizabeth Batts , of Barking , whose dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor 's marriage : early in 1763 Cook was appointed surveyor and would be away in Newfoundland for five successive summers . He worked around the south-east from the main settlement of St John 's , in the north in the Strait of Belle Isle that separates the irregular landmass from Labrador , then along the southern , and finally along the western coasts . Now , to you and I , Newfoundland perhaps seems remote and obscure . Then it belonged to a theatre of superpower contest and was the base for the richest fishery that Europeans knew . Its lands , shores and waters were disputed not only between European states , but between Beothuk and other native peoples , which Cook noticed and understood but did not report or analyse . Between voyages , he was back in London . He presented the Admiralty Lords with their charts , called periodically on the engraver Larken , on the cartographic engraver-publisher Thomas Jefferys at Charing Cross and on nautical printer-booksellers like Mount and Page . // Naval men and fishermen were not the only Europeans around Newfoundland in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were shipped about and supported by the British and who in return gave the navy reports about the so-called Eskimos and Indians . Their journals describe tense and difficult encounters between ' Fisher people ' and locals . They try to prevent excesses on the part of whites and try to explain whites to natives . They are vulnerable not only because they are unarmed imperialists , but also because they do n't know quite where 's where . // We went to the Indians &amp; enquired of them how they called the Bay in which they lived ? answ : Kankerlarsoak &amp; also the name of the great Island which lies in the middle ? answ Kisseksakkut ... After Dinner we went again to the Indians ; When we shewed them the Chart they understood it , &amp; directly pointed , each of them , to the place where their respective Houses stood . They told the names of the Islands &amp; . They also shewed the place where the Ship that sometimes comes to them Anchored , &amp; even pointed out the different anchoring Places in the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , were entirely convinced that Esquimaux Bay as its called in the french chart is the place of their abode . // Here , the collective journal of four of these men gives us a sense that on this September day in 1765 , understanding was made out of recognition , conversation and translation . Imperfect French and English maps , probably of the same places , but with different names , were read against each other . Somehow , the Inuit immediately grasped European ways of representing places and spaces on paper . A man with an olive face and straight jet-black hair , who knows the colour and turbidity of the water in this channel and that , who knows the smell of the trees in this place and that , the soft soil full of pine needles here and the loam there , sees a flat and alien picture which , however , makes a kind of sense . He is able , even , to elucidate this European chart for Europeans . Such geographic knowledge as was made on this occasion emerged from meetings that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were no doubt incompetently expressed in languages new to foreigners , and from the movements of fingers and faces . // Cook 's geography did not belong to this register of uncertain human talk and gesture . It was mathematical and uncommunicative . Cartography did not proceed by consultation . Cook trusted techniques and instruments rather than people who had no particular reason to trust him . He surveyed without asking , because he had been trained to do it that way , but also because , around Newfoundland , he seemingly had no choice . The native people , the Beothuk , were few in number and kept their distance . Joseph Banks , who also visited Newfoundland in 1766 , recorded their ill-treatment : ' Our people who fish in those Parts Live in a continual State of warfare with them firing at them whenever they meet with them &amp; if they chance to find their houses or wigwams as they call them Plundering them immediately tho a Bow &amp; arrows &amp; what they call their Pudding is generaly the whole of their furniture . ' He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birch-bark canoes , and took scalps in a different , more extreme way than those he designated ' the Canadians ' - stripping their victim 's whole face rather than just the top of the head . The best of Banks 's remarks is his unembarrassed conclusion , ' So much for the Indians if half of what I wrote about them is true it is more than I expect . ' Rarely did travellers acknowledge so readily that travellers ' tales were what they told . // Cook 's maps had to occupy a different ground altogether to Banks 's teasing reports that offered then deprived his reader of serious notes on manners and customs . The charts start out as precise graphic documents , wonderfully big ones that are six or ten feet a side , yet intricate in their features , lines and inscriptions . In principle , we might suggest , the chart is the opposite of the traveller 's tale . The latter is all event and story , and is bound up with human improbability ; the former is supposedly independent of any and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes showing a ship 's track , but telling none of its transactions . // Later on , however , Cook 's maps acquire a part in a story , his biography . In popular accounts of his life , and in modern scholarship , it became conventional to regard them as proofs of this surveyor 's increasing ability . They gave him deserved recognition in naval circles , and justified the inspired choice of the Endeavour ' s commander . Equally , they can be seen as advances in a north Atlantic maritime history . They were printed , not only as individual sheets , but in compilations and portfolios such as The North American Pilot . The sea would always remain an uncertain domain , but these elaborately detailed printed papers gave coasts and banks and passages and rocks definite shapes and locations . Ships ' masters would henceforth have a better sense of where they were , and voyages would become safer . It makes complete sense to describe Cook 's maps and his navigational directions in these terms - if one is in the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his thirties engaged in exercises in measurement and applied geometry , working magic on rugged and intricate coastlines , reducing a shoreline as torn as an awful wound to points and lines on paper . Like many other eighteenth-century technicians and scientists , Cook indeed produced a new kind of accurate knowledge that suddenly showed up his predecessors ' efforts for their amateurishness . He changed the way this part of the world could be dealt with ; it tipped a wavering balance in favour of mariners and against the hazards of the sea and shore . It also tipped another balance , diminishing the purchase of those native peoples , and giving map-bearing Europeans a decisive advantage . Cook 's findings were not merely personal . Thanks to the engraver 's burin and the printing press , they could be synthesized , reproduced and sold on both sides of the north Atlantic . Subsequently , no trader or naval man was in the situation of the Moravians ; he did not need to ask a native person which place was which . // In London , a fortnight after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laureate 's ' Ode to the New Year ' , was performed before their majesties at St James 's Palace . For their sake , we can only hope that the music was a little more lively than the obsequious verses of William Whitehead . // No more shall George , whose parent Breast , Feels every Pang his subjects know , Behold a faithful Land distrest , Or hear one sigh of real Woe . But grateful Mirth , whose decent Bounds , No riot swells , no fear confounds , And heart-felt Ease , whose Glow within Exalts Contentment 's modest Mien , In every Face shall smile confest And in his People 's Joy the Monarch too be blest . // The poet 's expectation that 1768 would be distinguished by anything like ' heart-felt ease ' on the part of the King 's subjects would prove wide of the mark . No doubt the weather did not help . On the first of January , it was reported that ' a poor labouring man was found frozen to death on Harrow Would Common ' . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found frozen dead in Hog-lane , St Giles ; on succeeding days , so were a watchman at Wapping and ' a poor middle-aged Woman ' near Bagnigge-Wells . From Portsmouth it was reported that such deep snow , and such intense frost , had ' not been known in the memory of man ' , while boats were upset and broken by ice in the Thames . A correspondent to the St James Chronicle was one of many troubled by the crisis caused by the ' dearness of provisions ' , since , as he put it , ' the poor must , and yet can not live by their labour ' . //
