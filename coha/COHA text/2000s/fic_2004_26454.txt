Chapter One Marlowe I woke up and discovered that the phone was ringing . I had the groggy impression that it had been ringing for some time , and that the call was probably urgent . " Hello , " I said . It came out in a throaty whisper . " God , you sound sexy . Can I come over right now and see you ? " I rolled over to check the clock on my bedside table , accidentally kicking my cat in the head . It was one-thirty in the morning , I was barely conscious , and at some point during the night I 'd managed to put my foot through my black lace nightgown , ripping it down the middle . Of course I was going to see him . " I 'm not sure , " I said slowly . " Did you have an appointment ? " There was a pause on the other end . " I thought I did . I mean , I think I do . Do I ? " I turned on the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I believe you had an appointment at just after one . " " There was a problem and I just got off work this minute . " I pulled my torn nightgown over my head . " Hmm . I do n't know about this . You 're not a cop , are you ? " " Do I sound like a cop ? " " You ca n't always go by how people sound . Talking without having to look at someone is the easiest way to lie . " Rummaging through my lingerie drawer , I tossed aside twelve pairs of cotton bikini underpants and four beige brassieres before unearthing a black and pink thong and push-up bra set that looked appropriately whorish . " So let me talk to you face-to-face . " I cradled the phone between my shoulder and chin as I hooked the bra 's clasp between my breasts . " Are you willing to pay the price ? " " Abso-fucking-lutely . " " But you do n't even know what that is yet . " " For you , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thong panties and checked myself out in the full-length mirror on my bathroom door . Should I clean up my sleep-smeared eye makeup ? Nah . So what if I looked like I was taking a brief pause between sessions of inspired debauchery ? At least I did n't look like a psychologist in private practice who was about to have sex for the first time in over a year . As for what could motivate an attractive , financially secure woman with a Ph.D . in clinical psych to let a man think that she was a call girl , well , I could say it was just being a single thirtysomething woman in Manhattan . Or else I could cite the fact that I 'd been told that if I wanted to publish my dissertation , I needed to spice it up with some intimate personal revelations . The truth , of course , was messier , more complicated , and a lot less rational . Most people think that therapists are immune to the kinds of problems they treat , but the truth is , we 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally blinded by it . If Joe were a client , I 'd probably diagnose him as a high-achieving , mildly obsessive type Apersonality with excellent coping skills and some deep , underlying insecurity . I 'd also have a much better handle on what 's really motivating him , because he 's not the kind of guy who needs to hire a date by the hour . In fact , it 's not always clear to me who 's seducing whom . " Marlowe ? You still there , or did you fall asleep on me ? " " All right , " I said . " You can come over . But make it snappy . " " I 'm on my way . " " Oh , and Joe ? " " Yeah ? " " Bring your handcuffs . " Continues ...
