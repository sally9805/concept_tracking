COLLEGE BASKETBALL The NBA 's recently instituted 19-year-old age minimum will alter the way college coaches recruit and-even more important-ensures superstar GREG ODEN 's enrollment at Ohio State // Maybe you 've believed Greg Oden for as long as he has been saying , " I always wanted to go to college . " Or maybe you swore to believe him only when you saw him lining up for freshman orientation ; after all , rejecting an eight-figure contract would be tougher in reality than in the abstract . Maybe you do n't yet know who the heck Greg Oden is , which means you 've got some catching up to do . Things move fast in basketball now . One day , LeBron James dazzles spectators at a summer talent camp . Soon after , he 's driving a Hummer to high school-and before his 19th birthday , he is one of America 's wealthiest athletes . But the NBA 's recent agreement to restrict draft entry to players at least 19 years old and one year beyond their high school graduation dates will slow this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-0 center and a senior this fall at Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis , no longer had to make a decision between college and the draft-only among colleges . Last week he selected Ohio State , which he will attend along with high school teammate Mike Conley . Oden and legions of other college prospects will begin traversing the country this week for the July recruiting period , which will take Oden from east ( Teaneck , N.J. , and the ABCD Camp ) to west ( Las Vegas and the Reebok Big Time Tournament ) . But Oden no longer will deal with questions about his interest in joining the preps-to-pros parade . He addressed that issue in every city where he played during the past 18 months . Not that he minded . " It was n't really that bad , " says Oden , a young man of few words and many dunks . " It was about what , 20 seconds for that question ? So it 's not that big of a bother . " Plenty of veteran basketball people have declared that the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college game . Try selling this to coaches at Ohio State , Duke , Texas and North Carolina , who pursued commitments from elite players in the recruiting class of 2006 though many of those players , if given the choice , would have considered entering the draft next spring . The rule will have a revolutionary effect on the Buckeyes . Because of it , they will be adding Oden , the most dominant center prospect since Shaquille O'Neal , as well as sweet-shooting athletic wing Daequan Cook . Duke already has three important commitments for 2006 , including shooting guard Gerald Henderson Jr. , son of the former NBA player . The Blue Devils are one year removed from losing point guard recruit Shaun Livingston to the draft , so they recognize the rule 's impact . This will be monumental for Texas , which shocked recruiting analysts by poaching 6-10 small forward Kevin Durant away from North Carolina , the presumed leader . Durant is widely acknowledged as the No. 2 player in the 2006 class . Photograph // Nevertheless , the Tar Heels have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard recruit Wayne Ellington would have been attracting NBA attention by the end of this season . " They were going to be sweating next June , " says Scout.com recruiting analyst Dave Telep . " He would have been a guy who could have made that jump . " All of these programs gambled a little with the 2006 recruiting class , hoping either the players they landed would be interested in developing their talents or , more to the point , that NBA commissioner David Stern would succeed in his campaign to have a 20-year age minimum installed in the next collective bargaining agreement . Stern did n't entirely deliver , but the new rule will greatly affect how colleges recruit . Every school capable of attracting elite players will have to decide whether it will be worthwhile to chase prospects who appear likely to make just a one-year layover in college basketball . Texas coach Rick Barnes says the Longhorns will continue to recruit those players , as they did with center LaMarcus Aldridge a year ago . Aldridge entered the 2004 draft but withdrew after being injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide eyes , " Barnes says . " We 've always made sure we had options . " North Carolina kept forward Marvin Williams for just one season . Coach Roy Williams insists he " absolutely " would take a player with that degree of talent , commitment and character for another one-year run . But he 'll choose such players carefully . " I think this has to be a total package thing , " Roy Williams says . " If it 's going to be a guy who treats your university as a bus stop-that 's not what I want our program to be about . " Even before this rule passed , Arizona coach Lute Olson determined to avoid that circumstance when possible . Last year , he offered a scholarship to Seattle wing Marcus Williams rather than the more celebrated Martell Webster . Oison suspected Webster might not be enthusiastic about pursuing a college career . Webster wound up as the No. 6 overall pick in last week 's NBA draft . Photograph Unlike James , who became one of America 's wealthiest athletes before turning 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new age-minimum rule will make one-year college careers such as Williams ' commonplace . // Arizona 's 2003-04 team was crippled when the Wildcats lost 6-9 recruit Ndudi Ebi to the draft . Olson says Arizona will try to stay on top of its recruits ' intentions , checking out rumors and keeping track of agent activity . " When they start talking about the money , all of a sudden a lot of things change , " Olson says . " It 's not easy to evaluate things this way , but we try to research it as much as we can . " In a game corrupted by instant gratification , however , no aspect of the new draft rule seems as important as the fact it will deliver Oden to the NCAA . Think about how rarely a player with Oden 's size and gifts winds up in college . Coming up with the list requires skipping back through generations : O'Neal , Ewing , Walton , Alcindor , Chamberlain , Russell . Now consider that a whole lot of guys in the past decade who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kwame Brown , Eddy Curry and Jonathan Bender ) saw no need to bother with college and still wound up as top five draft picks . Had there been no suggestion an age minimum were imminent , it is possible Oden would have gotten as many recruiting letters from Division I programs as I did . Some of the most outrageous talents in recent high school classes essentially went unrecruited . The Magic 's Dwight Howard never signed a letter of intent . Bulls forward Tyson Chandler used to list UCLA as a college he wanted to attend , but the Bruins were n't even calling him at the time . Reporters who attended James ' news conference at the 2002 ABCD Camp had to choke back laughter when he announced the list of five colleges he was interested in attending . Ohio State pursued Oden as ardently as a team can court a junior prospect and hoped college would make sense for him . It helped that the Buckeyes were sold on Conley , Oden 's close friend , who says he never saw himself entering the draft out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playmaker even had Oden been in position to move directly to the pros . Wake Forest , the other finalist in the players ' recruitment , followed the same approach . " I really think he does want to play college basketball . That does n't mean I believed him that he ever would , " Telep says . " I find it extremely hard to believe Greg Oden would have been able to pass up what would have been on his plate . " Oden waited to see what the NBA would do with the age minimum , but he never has publicly wavered from his plans . " I wanted to have that college experience , the college life , become a young man and develop my game , " Oden says . " Because 1 know right now my basketball game is not good enough to go to the NBA . " His game is good enough for him to get him drafted , but Oden 's design is to enter the league when he can make an impact . He does not claim to know when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes for me to feel that I 'm NBA-ready . " Believe that ? Sidebar Five stars you could see shooting in college Not every top prospect in high school basketball will head to college as the result of the NBAs new draft entry regulations . But some of the best probably will wear Division I uniforms . Top talent scouts DaveTelep of Scout.com and Van Coleman of Hoopmasters.com assess the elite from the class of 2006 : 1 Greg Oden , 7-0 , C , Lawrence North ( Indianapolis ) . Committed to Ohio State . Telep : " He 's a go-to move away from being a completely dominant center . He 's a big-tirne defensive intimidator . " Coleman : " We know he would be the No. 1 guy in the draft . With his size , his skill level and his work ethic-that 's a big key for him . His athleticism may be beyond Tim Duncan 's . He scores and passes the ball extremely well . " 2 Kevin Durant 6-10 , SF , Oak Hill Academy ( Mouth of Wilson , Va @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's almost an anomaly that a guy that big can shoot the ball the way he does . He 's starting to really feel himself and become competitive now . " Coleman : " He 's thin but stronger than most people would think . Normally , he 's very consistent from beyond the arc . He can score on the blocks against a smaller wing , and a bigger player can not guard him on the perimeter because his jump shot sets them on their heels . " Photograph Sidebar 3 Brandan Wright , 6-9 , PF , Brentwood ( Tenn . ) Academy . Considering Kentucky , North Carolina , Duke and others . Telep : " I compare him to a younger Chris Bosh . He 's got some work to do on his perimeter game , but he 's bouncy at the rim and seems to have a nose for the basketball . " Photograph Sidebar Coleman : " He 's a power forward at the NBA level , with the ability to face up at 15 to 17 feet and score-especially off the elbow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really well and beats a lot B of people upcourt.

Telep : " One of the top student-athletes to come along in a long time . He 's a slasher , a shooter , a scorer-a terrific perimeter prospect with a lot of tools . " Coleman : " He 's more of a question mark . He 's got to prove himself . The jump shot is still the one thing I would like to see him take to another level . He has the ability to put it on the floor and get to the hoop , no question about that . " Photograph Sidebar 5 Paul Harris , 6-4 , SG , Niagara Falls ( N.Y. ) High . Syracuse and Pittsburgh are his top choices . Telep : " I call him the nuclear weapon . You do n't exactly know what he is , but you do n't want anybody else to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , maybe the best 6-4 rebounder I 've seen . " Coleman : " The jump shot is the major concern . You get a 6-5 guy on him , he 'll destroy him on the low block . He does have the ballhandling skills . He really has to be a guy who works at 300 to 500 shots a day until he 's ready for the draft .
