Chapter One from The Sword of Bedwyr CHAPTER 1 ETHAN 'S DOUBTS ETHAN BEDWYR , eldest son of the Eorl of Bedwydrin , stood tall on the balcony of the great house in Dun Varna , watching as the twomasted , black-sailed ship lazily glided into the harbor . The proud man wore a frown even before the expected standard , crossed open palms above a bloodshot eye , came into view . Only ships of the king or the barbarians to the northeast would sail openly upon the dark and cold waters of the Dorsal Sea , so named for the eerie black fins of the flesheating whales that roamed the waters in ravenous packs , and barbarians did not sail alone . A second standard-a strong arm , bent at the elbow and holding a miner 's pick-soon appeared . " Visitors ? " came a question from behind . Recognizing the voice as his father 's , Ethan did not turn . " Flying the duke of Montfort 's pennant , " he answered , and his disdain was obvious . Gahris Bedwyr moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon the man , who appeared proud and strong , as Ethan distantly remembered him . With the light of the rising sun in his face , Gahris 's cinnamon eyes shone brightly , and the stiff ocean breeze blew his thick shock of silvery white hair back from his ruddy , creased face , a face that had weathered under the sun during countless hours in small fishing craft out on thedangerous Dorsal . Gahris was as tall as Ethan , and that was taller than most men on Isle Bedwydrin , who in turn were taller than most other men of the kingdom . His shoulders remained broader than his belly , and his arms were corded from a youth spent in tireless work . But as the black-sailed ship drifted closer to the docks , the coarse shouts of the brutish cyclopian crew urging the islanders into subservient action , Gahris 's eyes betrayed his apparent stature . Ethan turned his gaze back to the harbor , having no desire to look upon his broken father . " It is the duke 's cousin , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was touring the northern isles on holiday . Ah well , we must see to his pleasures . " Gahris turned as if to leave , then stopped , seeing that stubborn Ethan had not loosed his grip on the balcony rail . " Will you fight in the arena for the pleasure of our guest ? " he asked , already knowing the answer . " Only if the duke 's cousin is my opponent , " Ethan replied in all seriousness , " and the fight is to the death . " " You must learn to accept what is , " Gahris Bedwyr chided . Ethan turned an angry gaze on him , a look that might have been Gahris 's own a quarter of a century before , before independent Eriador had fallen under the iron rule of King Greensparrow of Avon . It took the elder Bedwyr a long moment to compose himself , to remind himself of all that he and his people stood to lose . Things were not so bad for the folk of Bedwydrin , or for those on any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Avon proper , south of the mountains called the Iron Cross , and though Morkney , the duke of Montfort , had exacted rigid control over the folk of the Eriadoran mainland , he left the islanders fairly alone-as long as he received his tithes and his emissaries were granted proper treatment whenever they happened onto one of the isles . " Our life is not so bad , " Gahris remarked , trying to soothe the burning fires in his dangerously proud son . The eorl would not be shocked if later that day he learned that Ethan had attacked the duke 's cousin in broad daylight , before a hundred witnesses and a score of Praetorian Guards ! " Not if one aspires to subservience , " Ethan growled back , his ire unrelenting . " You 're a great-grand , " Gahris muttered under his breath , meaning that Ethan was one of those throwbacks to the days of fierce independence , when Bedwydrin had fought against any who would call themselves rulers . The island 's history was filled with tales of war-against raiding barbarians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by force , united the land , and even against the mighty Gascon fleet , when that vast southern kingdom had attempted to conquer all of the lands in the frigid northern waters . Avon had fallen to the Gascons , but the hardened warriors of Eriador had made life so miserable for the invaders that they had built a wall to seal off the northern province , proclaiming the land too wild to be tamed . It was Bedwydrin 's boast during those valorous times that no Gascon soldier had stepped upon the island and lived . But that was ancient history now , seven generations removed , and Gahris Bedwyr had been forced to yield to the winds of change . " I am Bedwydrin , " Ethan muttered back , as if that claim should explain everything . " Always the angry rebel ! " the frustrated Gahris snapped at him . " Damn the consequences of your actions ! Your pride has not the foresight- " " My pride marks me as Bedwydrin , " Ethan interrupted , his cinnamon eyes , the trademark of the Bedwyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of those eyes forestalled the eorl 's retort . " At least your brother will properly entertain our guests , " Gahris said calmly , and walked away . Ethan looked back to the harbor-the ship was in now , with burly , one-eyed cyclopians rushing about to tie her up , pushing aside any islanders who happened in their way , and even a few who took pains not to . These brutes did not wear the silver-and-black uniforms of the Praetorian Guards but were the house guard escorts kept by every noble . Even Gahris had a score of them , gifts from the duke of Montfort . With a disgusted shake of his head , Ethan shifted his gaze to the training yard below and to the left of the balcony , where he knew that he would find Luthien , his only sibling , fifteen years his junior . Luthien was always there , practicing his swordplay and his archery . Training , always training . He was his father 's pride and joy , that one , and even Ethan had to admit that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never seen him . He spotted his brother immediately by the reddish tint of his long and wavy hair , just a shade darker than Ethan 's blond locks . Even from this distance , Luthien cut an impressive figure . He stood two inches above six feet , with a broad chest and muscled arms , his skin golden brown , a testament for his love of the outdoors on this isle , which saw more rain than sun . Ethan scowled as he watched Luthien easily dispatch his latest sparring partner , then pivot immediately and with a single thrust , twist , and leg-sweep maneuver take down the opponent who rushed in at his back , trying to take him by surprise . Those warriors watching in the training yard gave a cheer of approval , and Luthien politely stood and bowed . Yes , Ethan knew , Luthien would properly entertain their " guests , " and the thought brought bile into the proud man 's throat . He did n't really blame Luthien , though ; his brother was young and ignorant . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , had never known Gahris before the rise of the Wizard-King Greensparrow . Gahris walked out into the training yard , then , and motioned for Luthien to join him . Smiling and nodding , the eorl pointed to the docks . Luthien responded with a wide smile and ran off , toweling his corded muscles as he went : always ready to please . " My pity to you , dear brother , " Ethan whispered . The sentiment was an honest one , for Ethan knew well that Luthien would one day have to face up to the truth of their land and the cowardice of their father . A shout from the dock stole Ethan 's attention , and he looked that way just in time to see a cyclopian smash an islander fisherman to the wharf . Two other cyclopians joined their comrade , and the three punched and kicked the man repeatedly , until he finally managed to scramble away . Laughing , the three went back to their duties tying up the cursed craft . Ethan had seen enough . He spun away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own one-eyed soldiers as they walked past . " Heir of Bedwyr , " one of the cyclopians greeted through smiling , pointy yellow teeth . Ethan did not miss the condescension in the brute 's tone . He was the heir of Bedwyr , true enough , but the title rang hollow to the cyclopians , who ultimately served only the king of Avon and his wizard dukes . These guards , these " gifts " from the duke of Montfort , were no more than spies , Ethan knew as everybody knew . Not a soul on Bedwyr mentioned that little fact openly though . " Do your appointed rounds normally take you to the private quarters of the ruling family ? " Ethan snapped . " We have only come to inform the nobles that the cousin of the duke of Montfort has arrived , " the other guard replied . Ethan stared at the ugly creature for a long while . Cyclopians were not quite as tall as most men , but were much thicker , with even the smallest of the burly race weighing nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred . Their foreheads , slipping out of a tight patch of stringy hair , were typically sloped down to the bushy brow of the single , always bloodshot , eye . Their noses were flat and wide , their lips almost nonexistent , offering a perpetual view of those animal-like yellow teeth . And no cyclopian had ever been accused of possessing a chin . " Gahris knows of the arrival , " Ethan replied , his voice grim , almost threatening . The two cyclopians looked at each other and smirked , but their smiles disappeared when they looked back at the fiery Ethan , whose hand had gone to the hilt of his sword . Two young boys , human servants of the noble family , had come into the hall and were watching the encounter with more than a passing interest . " Strange to wear a sword in one 's own private quarters , " one of the cyclopians remarked . " Always a wise precaution when smelly one-eyes are about , " Ethan answered loudly , taking strength in the appearance of the two human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guards . " And not another word from your mouth , " Ethan commanded . " Your breath does so offend me . " The scowls increased , but Ethan had called their bluff . He was the son of the eorl , after all , an eorl the cyclopians had to at least maintain the pretense of serving . The two soldiers turned about and stomped off . Ethan glanced at the boys , who were running off , but undeniably smiling . They were the youth of Bedwydrin , the eldest son thought . The youth of a proud race . Ethan took some solace and some hope in their obvious approval of the way he had stood down the ugly cyclopians . Perhaps the future would be a better time . But despite the fleeting hope , Ethan knew that he had given his father yet another reason to berate him . from Luthien 's Gamble CHAPTER 1 THE MINISTRY THE REVOLT HAD BEGUN HERE , in the huge nave of the Ministry , and the dried blood of those killed in the first battle could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , splattered across the walls and the sculpted statues . The cathedral was built along the wall separating the city 's merchant class from the common folk , and thus held a strategic position indeed . It had changed hands several times in the weeks since the fighting began , but so determined were the revolutionaries that the cyclopians still had not held the place long enough to climb the tower and cut down Duke Morkney 's body . This time , though , the one-eyed brutes had come on in full force , and the Ministry 's western doors had been breached , as well as the smaller entrance into the cathedral 's northern transept . Cyclopians poured in by the score , only to be met by determined resistors , and fresh blood covered the dried blood staining the wooden pews and the stone floor . In mere seconds , there were no obvious battle lines , just a swarming mob of bitter enemies , hacking at each other with wild abandon , killing and dying . The fighting was heard in the lower section of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-elven and half-human , and her twoscore elvish companions-more than a third of all the elves in Montfort-were quick to answer the call . A secret entrance had been fashioned in the wall of the great cathedral , which it shared with lower Montfort , cut by cunning dwarfs in those rare times when there was a lull in the fighting . Now Siobhan and her companions rushed from the lower section of town , scrambling up preset ropes into the passageway . They could hear the fighting in the nave as they crawled along the crude tunnel . The passage split , continuing along the city 's dividing wall , then curving as it traced the shape of the cathedral 's apse . The dwarfs had not had a hard time fashioning the passage , for the massive wall was no less then ten feet thick in any place , and many tunnels were already in place , used by those performing maintenance on the cathedral . Soon the elves were traveling generally west . They came to an abrupt end in the tunnel at a ladder that led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , west again , and finally north , completing the circuit of the southern transept . Finally Siobhan pushed a stone aside and crawled out onto the southern triforium , an open ledge fifty feet up from the floor that ran the length of the nave , from the western door all the way to the open area of the crossing transepts . The beautiful half-elf gave a resigned sigh as she brushed the long wheat-colored tresses from her face and considered the awful scene below . " Pick your shots with care , " Siobhan instructed her elven companions as they crowded out behind her and filtered along the length of the ledge . The command hardly seemed necessary as they viewed the jumble of struggling bodies below . Not many targets presented themselves , but few archers in all of Avonsea could match the skill of the elves . The great longbows sang out , arrows slicing through the air unerringly to take down cyclopians . A quarter of the elvish force , with Siobhan in the lead , ran along the triforium all the way to its western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , ran across the western narthex and crossed the nave , opening onto the northern triforium . The elves rushed among the shadows , around the many statues decorating that ledge , to its opposite end , the base of the northern transept . More cyclopians poured in through the door there , and there were few defenders to stem their flow in this area . The ten elves bent their bows and fired off arrow after arrow , devastating the invading cyclopians , filling the northern transept with bodies . Below in the nave , the tide seemed to turn , with the cyclopians , their reinforcements dwindling , unable to keep up the momentum of their initial attack . But then there came an explosion as a battering ram shattered the doors at the end of the southern transept , destroying the barricades that had been erected there . A new wave of cyclopians charged in , and neither the archers on the triforium nor the men fighting in the nave could slow them . " It is as if all the one-eyes of Montfort have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Siobhan nodded , not disagreeing with the assessment . Apparently Viscount Aubrey , the man rumors named as the new leader of the king 's forces in Montfort , had decided that the Ministry had been in enemy hands long enough . Aubrey was a buffoon , so it was said , one of the far too many fumbling viscounts and barons in Eriador who claimed royal blood , lackeys all to the unlawful Avon king . A buffoon by all accounts , but nevertheless Aubrey had taken control of the Montfort guards , and now the viscount was throwing all of his considerable weight at the rebel force in the cathedral . " Luthien predicted this , " Siobhan lamented , speaking of her lover , whom the fates had chosen as the Crimson Shadow . Indeed , only a week before , Luthien had told Siobhan that they would not be able to hold the Ministry until spring . " We can not stop them , " said the elf behind Siobhan . Siobhan 's first instinct was to yell out at the elf , to berate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree . Viscount Aubrey wanted the Ministry back , and so he would have it . No longer was their job the defense of the great building . Now all they could hope to do was get as many allies out alive as possible . And , in the process , inflict as much pain as possible on the cyclopians . Siobhan bent her bow and let fly an arrow that thudded into the chest of a one-eyed brute an instant before it thrust its huge sword into a man it had knocked to the floor . The cyclopian stood perfectly still , its one large eye staring down at the quivering shaft , as though the brute did not understand what had happened to it . Its opponent scrambled back to his feet and brought his club in a roundhouse swing that erased the dying brute 's face and hastened its descent to the floor . ( Continues ... )
