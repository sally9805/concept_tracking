HE 'S A third-team All-America safety and an electrifying punt returner , and he certainly puts some fight into the Irish . Notre Dame senior Tom Zbikowski was once a fearsome Golden Gloves boxer , going 75 -- 15 before winning his pro debut at Madison Square Garden last year with a 49-second KO . So , if the Irish find themselves at an especially low point ( they lost to Georgia Tech 33 -- 3 last week , and this Saturday face No. 17 Penn State ) , the 6-foot , 207-pound Zbikowski may be the man to get them up off the canvas . // On the difference between landing a knockout punch and a big football hit // A knockout , that 's the end of the fight . You 've won . A big hit , you 've got to get up for the next play . That receiver might come back and try to score on you . // On how he became a Notre Dame fan // I grew up near Chicago in Arlington Heights , Ill. and the first college game I watched was Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Florida State fan  --  I do n't know why . I had to cheer against him . I did n't follow college football , that was the first time I found out what Notre Dame was and what the program was about . I just cheered against my brother , knowing he 'd beat me up later . // On his charity , Tommy Z9 Foundation Inc. // My mom and I started it after the Madison Square Garden fight . E.J. has had brain-tumor surgery , so I wanted to give money for research . He benefitted from the cutting edge of technology when he had surgery  --  at age six and then at nine  --  and that 's why he 's alive today . When things like that happen , you want to give back . // On getting his first tattoo this spring // It 's on my left rib cage . I had a brother , Steve , who died at one-week old on Oct. 6 , 1980 , of transposed arteries . It happened before I was born . The tattoo is the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're Catholic . We go to church every Sunday as a family . // On how he got started as a boxer // My dad Eddie , a former Golden Gloves fighter is a fight fan , so I 'd watch fights with him . I asked if I could train and learn to box , and I started a month before my 10th birthday . My mom Sue was n't too happy about it . She said if I ever got knocked out , I 'd be done boxing . Luckily that 's never happened . My mom has come to my last three fights , but when I was a kid she would almost never come . She did n't enjoy the places we were boxing . A lot of times they were bars with girls that liked to dance . // On sparring with top boxers // I used to spar against guys like the WBC lightweight champion David Diaz . When you spar against guys like that and then go into amateur fights , it 's almost like the amateur fights are in slow motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 seconds they 're setting up combinations to go against your weaknesses . I almost busted my jaw while sparring  --  I could n't really eat for a week  --  but in a real fight , I never got caught like that . // On returning punts // You 're back there all alone , and it feels like 20-some guys are running straight down on you . You 've got to find your seam and hit it as hard as you can , just take off running . You ca n't have any second thoughts or any fears . // On whether he has any fears // I do , but I try to keep that quiet and not let people know what they are .
