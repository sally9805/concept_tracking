Libby killed herself just before the holidays , and so the flamingo stayed where it had been hidden  --  in the rotten shed at the edge of our yard . I 'd often sneak out to look at it . The flamingo seemed incredibly big , its wooden neck reaching up past the shelves of potting soil and garden shears . It stood six feet tall , was painted a brilliant pink , and back then , when I was nine years old , I thought it was the most beautiful thing I 'd ever seen . I 'd close the door and stand there in the shed , the smell of lawn-mower gas making me dizzy . The flamingo 's wood had been sanded smooth , and I 'd lay my check against the curve of a wing , or wrap my hands around the sturdy pole legs . <p> Sometimes I told the flamingo things that were upsetting me. l never planned on doing this , it just happened . I told it about things that went on in school , or my dreams , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . I might describe how she had called in sick to work again from her job as a secretary at the local high school , and was in the house , right that moment , still in her nightgown , even though , it was four-thirty in the afternoon . I would explain how if I went to her she would want me to hug her as she cried , or hold her hand as she slept . Or I might tell how on some mornings my mother would wake me singing " High Hopes " or " You Are My Sunshine . " How she 'd throw open my curtains , laughing , then scoop me into her arms and carry me down the stairs before I fully woke up . On those mornings , her hazel eyes were bright , and her blond hair was clean and shiny , swept up with a few pieces curling at her neck . Her frosty lipstick was perfect . And it would seem , for a moment , as if those other mornings  --  when she could barely bring herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand  --  had never really happened . <p> My mother and her two friends , Dee and Loretta , had originally bought the flamingo with the plan of leaving it in Libby 's yard late Christmas Eve night , decorated with lights and tinsel . Before Libby died , the four of them had a joke which involved leaving embarrassing lawn decorations in each other 's yards . My mother had planted her share of tacky windmills and wooden cutouts of geese or squirrels . One morning we woke to find a rock garden , made from stones painted orange and pink , gracing the area around our mailbox . <p> Of all of my mother 's friends , I loved Libby the most . She was strong and sure , never weak . She wore tailored dresses and heady perfume . She smoked , drove fast , and flipped the finger at anyone who got in her way . She was the first woman , the first adult , I 'd ever heard say the word " luck . " She called me " kid " and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she understood how things were , and I loved her especially for this . <p> Libby had always known how to talk my mother up from her low times , or down from her craziness . Besides me , Libby had been the only other person who really understood how bad my mother could get . Even though they had other friends like Dee and Loretta and some neighbors , the two of them were the closest , and only Libby really saw my mother at her worst . Neither had much of a family  --  Libby was divorced with no children , and my mother just had me . My father was never mentioned , and if I asked my mother , which I rarely did , she 'd say , " He came and he " went , " or " I knew him for a short time and then he was gone . That was it . So she and Libby were on their own . They were always there for each other , or rather Libby was usually there for my mother . <p> But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the women in her family ; she 'd seen her grandmother , and more recently a younger sister , die slowly and full of pain . And so when she realized her life was over , she did n't wait until she was forced to bed . Instead she secretly planned out her death , detailed and thoughtful . A few days before Christmas she overdosed on medication , leaving notes and gifts for her loved ones , explaining her actions , asking them to understand and not be angry . For my mother she left a box containing an angel made of paper and dried leaves painted gold , as well as a picture of Libby and my mother when they were twelve , the summer they first became friends , posing in their bathing suits in the backyard . Libby is looking at the camera straight on , her lips puckering into a kiss , and my mother is whirling around beside her with her hands held up , the sun shining on her skin . Across the bottom Libby had written , Do n't forget what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Libby died , my mother tell into a series of downswings , each worse than the one before . Sometimes she would stay in bed for an entire day , the velvet curtains in her room drawn . I tried to do things like the laundry or dishes . I 'd bring food to her  --  soup or cereal or toast with cheese , which was the extent of what I knew how to make back then . <p> " Get in bed with me , " she 'd often say . " Please . " <p> It was usually late afternoon , after I 'd come home from school . I 'd crawl under the flowered sheet and press myself against her . I 'd feel the way the flat of her back fit mine perfectly , but she 'd be shaking with sobs and hiccups that would n't let her breathe , and so it was scary , not comforting , to lie so close . <p> " I ca n't stand it " she 'd say in the darkness . There would be light hinting around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I were a simple wisp of air , that I could rise and slip through that crack of light into what was left of the day . <p> " I ca n't stand that every night for those last few weeks , she must have climbed the stairs to her bedroom , alone with all that fear . And there was nothing I could do . " <p> She was talking about Libby , although now I think it was also a way to talk about herself . I am convinced fear had something to do with her taking to bed for days , and the mania that often preceded or followed . Back then , I had fears of my own , but there was no one to listen . Only the flamingo , and even after what happened with Mr. Schenley that summer , even after I lost my voice and could not speak , still I went out to the shed . I would close the door and sit in the dark beside the flamingo 's feet . The large bird would stand silent , tilting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I stopped speaking because of a car accident a few days after the school year ended in June . It happened on the way home from swimming practice at the YWCA . Mr. Schenley , a man who lived a few neighborhoods away , was driving the car . He came to take me and two other girls home . It was his turn in the carpool , even though his daughter had n't been there that evening , which was n't unusual , since she seemed to be sick a lot . I had n't missed his daughter , who I did n't especially like , although I felt sorry for her . She was a tall , big-boned girl who hunched her body to appear smaller , but only appeared hunched . She kept to herself . And even though she was a fine swimmer , she 'd often panic in meets , having to crawl out of the pool halfway through her race and run to the bathroom , where she 'd throw up . Then she 'd come back out and sit away from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . <p> That evening I was the last girl to be dropped off , and by the time it was only Mr. Schenley and me in the car , it had become quite dark . The sky filled with black clouds , and rain began to pound on the roof and windshield . It was one of those sudden , angry summer storms , completely unexpected . Mr. Schenley was acting strangely . He was perspiring heavily from the time he picked us up ; I noticed the wet stains under his arms . And once we were alone he seemed to have trouble breathing . He coughed and cleared his throat and made snort-like noises . I politely ignored all of this . <p> What caused the accident was simply that the car skidded out of control and across to the wrong lane . We 'd been going fast on a curvy back road with no guardrails , a few miles from my house . Trying to avoid an oncoming car , we slid off the road altogether and were airborne , dropping for what seemed a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth was caving in , and I realized we had crashed and rolled into the rocky stream below . My eyes were open the whole time . I saw everything . I saw Mr. Schenley 's body flopping around like a rag doll , because he did n't have his seatbelt on like I did . I saw his head crack the windshield , and blood spray out of his nose and mouth . Then he looked as if he were doing some kind of strange acrobatic flip in the front seat , so his feet were on the ceiling , and one of his fists shot over and slammed my jaw , at which point I must have blacked out . When I regained consciousness , it was strangely quiet except for the rain on the roof , and the hiss and click of the cooling car parts . I could hear water running somewhere close-by . The inside lights were on , and there was smoke drifting through the car , but I could n't see a fire . It was then I realized that I had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time as I noticed that Mr. Schenley was upside down in the seat beside me , his head craned around facing me , his neck in a crazy , twisted position . His eyes were wide open but completely flat , like those of a doll or stuffed animal . His nose was a bloody , purple mess . <p> I did not tell my mother or police or doctors any of this . I let them think I was too frightened to remember , and so they accepted my silence a little more easily . And so I also did not tell them what happened before we crashed , in fact the reason that we even did crash . That Mr. Schenley was taking the long way home , and that at some point during the drive he began to act even more nervous , and finally rested his hand between my legs . I looked over , and his fly was open , so I could see a part of him that was terrifying , that I could n't believe was real . I closed my eyes then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to thump with panic , I sat very still , as if I had suddenly fallen asleep . I thought that perhaps if I did not move , if I pretended to ignore Mr. Schenley 's now erratic breathing , and the way his hand had begun to make the smallest nudging motion , then it might all go away . I might be somehow able to slip out and float above it all until whatever was done was done . <p> I did n't tell anyone that actually the crash was , in a way , a huge relief , the escape I desperately needed . That after it happened I wondered if I had somehow wished it into being , and if I should feel guilty , like I often do about anything . I did n't tell anyone that his last words were , simply and stupidly , Oh shit , and that I would later hear him shouting those words in the middle of the night , loud and clear in my bedroom , and each time I 'd wake with a start and smell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand dangling across the seat , the hand that had been on me just before , and that even then , even when I knew it was dead , I was still very scared of that hand . <p> Luckily the school year was finished , so it was fairly easy to exist in my silence . Except for the summer swim team , which was no big deal , I was out of my normal loop of activities and friends . The doctors at the hospital said I had gone into some kind of psychological shock . They told my mother I 'd speak when I was ready . But after a few days she began to worry . She 'd sit on my bed and hold my hands saying , " Not even one word for me ? " And when I did n't make a noise she would lie across my legs and weep into the bedspread . <p> A week after the accident she took me to my regular doctor , a wise , older man who was respected in the community , and who was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel safe . My mother was in a stern mood that day . She wore a serious gray dress with long sleeves , even though the early summer air was hot and humid . Her thick , blond hair was yanked back into a tight bun . Since my accident she had collected herself , but was still acting irritated  --  muttering under her breath and swearing a lot . She was likely to explode at the smallest things , like her cereal getting soggy , or the clasp of her purse not working quite right . She acted as if my not speaking were a heavy burden upon her , as if it somehow made me unmanageable . At the doctor 's office she put a hand on each of my shoulders and directed me into the examining room , saying , " Well , sir , I 'm sorry to say , but we do have a problem here . " <p> The doctor glanced at her and then turned his attention to me . He examined my healing minor injuries and nodded with satisfaction . He touched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was in the hospital . I liked his hands  --  cool and gentle on my skin . They were hands that could tell when something was wrong . After he finished examining me , he looked into my eyes , and it was as if he 'd been in Mr. Schenley 's car with me and knew what had happened . The way he looked at me made me want to cry with relief . But I did n't , and he sent me out into the waiting room while my mother stayed in to talk with him . When the door finally opened about fifteen minutes later , she emerged with a stiff smile that made her look much less pretty . She took me by the arm and walked me briskly to the car , so I stumbled trying to keep up with her fast-moving feet . She was wearing low-heeled pumps that made a sharp , clacking sound . A few times she wobbled as an ankle gave way into a crack in the pavement . <p> Once we were in the car , she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parking lot beyond us . It was as if she were onstage and looking past the faces of the audience , or she 'd lose her nerve . <p> " Damn , " she said , and I thought she was going to start crying , but she just pressed her lips together and paused . Then she shook her head and started again . She told me clearly and slowly that I did n't have to speak if I did n't want to , that she could wait this out , but that under no circumstances was I to think that I could n't talk to her , because she was listening , she really was , and I should know that . <p> I nodded . <p> " And , " she said after thinking for a moment and tapping her fingers on the steering wheel , " I just hope you 're through with this by September . You ca n't go back to school without talking , you know . " <p> I nodded again . <p> " Okay , then , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , that if I still was n't talking when school began it would be a problem . The other kids would not quite believe it . They 'd sneak up and scare or tickle me to see if I would scream . They 'd taunt me since I had no defense . But somehow I expected to be talking by then . My silence did n't feel like something that was to last a lifetime . It was more like a temporary relief , a chance to rest . Like when you 're sick and are glad to have a good reason to stay in bed , pulling the covers up to your chin . I knew quite well that my ability to speak was not gone forever , it was just that I could n't bear to do it right then . <p> I also felt on some level that if I spoke , then difficult things would be expected of me . I would have to say what really happened in Mr. Schenley 's car . Or I would be asked over and over what it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " I just ca n't , honey , " if I asked her to please get out of bed , please get dressed . She 'd say , " It 's just too much , " and I 'd have to sit beside her in her darkened room and let her lean on me . I 'd have her towel in my hands , and the water would be running in the bathroom where I 'd turned it on a few minutes before . I 'd help her take off her nightgown and place a robe around her shoulders . <p> " Do n't worry , " I 'd have to tell her . " I 'm here . You 'll be just fine . " <p> In July , a month after my accident , my mother and her friends decided to have their own kind of memorial service for Libby . Back when Libby died before Christmas , they could stand to do nothing more than attend the required ceremony and burial , and so they had intended to have their own kind of service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided on July 15th because it was Libby 's birthday . In their eyes , the flamingo was a symbol for everything they loved about Libby , and so they wanted to plant it on her grave , a final gift , a last laugh . <p> The week before the memorial service , my mother 's mood changed drastically . She was suddenly riding high , energetic  --  a string pulled tight and getting tighter . As usual , I did not trust her manic bursts , and watched her cautiously . For the past few mornings she had risen early without my waking her , and showered before I even came downstairs from my bedroom . Since her job was finished for the summer , she had time to do a number of daytime projects . She sewed a light blue cotton dress . She embroidered daisies on several pairs of my socks . And one afternoon I came in from the yard where I had been playing for a few hours to find she had painted the bathroom yellow , not a soft color , but the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the memorial service , I could not sleep , l thought about my mother 's burst of energy , and a terrible hope began to tug at me , a hope I did n't want to give into , but could n't resist . I had watched my mother all day as she ran around our small house , cleaning and pushing things in and out of the oven because the next day the " girls " were coming over to have dinner and drinks before they all went to visit Libby 's grave . As I lay in bed I began to hope that perhaps her recent bout of dark moods had passed . I imagined her back to her old self , which , although moody , now seemed incredibly stable compared to how she 'd been since Libby 's death . I thought maybe her depression had run its course . Maybe this memorial service for Libby was breaking her spell of grief . She 'd spent the whole day getting things ready . She 'd even gone to the grocery store herself instead of calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast beef , ham salad , potato salad , pickled eggs , upside-down cake , a truly of assorted cheese and crackers . <p> I rose from my bed and walked barefoot through the house . As I passed my mother 's bedroom , I heard her mumble in her sleep , then turn over and sigh . I unlatched the kitchen screen door and crossed the damp grass to the shed . The flamingo was there in the darkness , its body and part of its oversized beak illuminated by a crack of moonlight . <p> Now , outside in the shed , my hope disappeared . I began to believe what I feared most : that my mother was on a temporary high , that she 'd probably be fine the next day , and maybe the next , then she 'd crash again . This knowledge sunk low in my gut , so I could feel it pulsing there , like a heart that belonged to a desperate part of myself . At that moment I somehow understood that each time my mother would sink a little deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from high school , I would see her in and out of hospitals , undergoing counseling and medications . For most of that time , I would live with a retired schoolteacher across town , who in the past had taken foster children into her home . Her name was Miss Mildred , and she would turn out to be patient and kind . For years , until her death long after I was grown , Miss Mildred would remain one of my closest friends , and more than once she would save me from spiraling down myself , if only by listening to me . <p> But I could n't know any of this as I stood alone in the shed that night . All that was ahead of me was another day , and each day had begun to feel like a wall that needed to be unbricked , piece by piece , and if I could get through without it all crumbling , then it was a good day . <p> I squinted in the darkness to look more closely at the flamingo . My mother had tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it fluttered in the light breeze from the open doorway . <p> I felt a little guilty for not speaking to it since I had lost my voice , even though I knew it did n't matter . The flamingo knew what I wanted to say . in fact I wondered if I had ever really spoken out loud to the flamingo at all . Maybe those other times in the shed , before I stopped speaking , I had just thought so hard that I imagined I heard my own voice . <p> I 'm sorry , I said , but the sound was somewhere deep inside of me , and what came out was barely a whisper . Still I moved my mouth to give the silent words shape , send them through the air . I had no desire to hear my voice right now . The quiet of the shed and the flamingo 's steady stare felt like peace to me . But I knew it would not last . I knew that words I was not speaking were somehow building up inside of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . I pictured a small sac in the very center of me that was growing heavy and tight , like a balloon filling with water , eventually bursting . But for now I was trying to ignore it . <p> Mr. Schenley was a creep , I told the flamingo . Then I went over how happy I was in the hospital bed when I woke and found out I was okay and , in fact , not in very much pain , and that they were burying Mr. Schenley two days later . <p> The flamingo looked back at me and did not flinch . Its eyes , steady and black , never left my face . <p> I silently told it other things then , like the only person I 'd ever known to die besides Mr. Schenley was Libby , and that the night after her funeral she came to visit me in a dream . She sat at the foot of my bed in her white burial dress and smoked a cigarette . Her dark hair was brushed away from her face , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The dream was so real I could smell the smoke that seemed to hover around her head like a halo , and feel her hand , which was warm , not cold , as she stroked my face and said , " Hang in there , kid . " <p> I also told it how scared I felt when my mother 's hands shook as she tried to do anything delicate , like put on mascara , or thread a needle , or put a key in a lock . <p> My mother might die , too , I told the flamingo . Then I turned around and went back inside the house to bed . <p> Early the next evening , Dee and Loretta showed up on our doorstep . As I expected , my mother was still riding her wave and had been up early , doing laundry for most of the day , washing everything from curtains and rugs and pillows to old Halloween costumes stored in the top of my closet . She 'd ironed all of it , and our house had a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a polka-dotted dress that she often wore to work during the school year . Her hair was pulled back by a wide cotton band , except for a few pieces that escaped and clung in curls to her sweaty forehead and cheeks . She looked pretty and flesh but tense , the bones in her jaw locked tight , the muscles in her neck rigid . I 'd kept out of her way for most of the day , although occasionally she 'd walk by and tousle my hair . " I feel good today , sweetie ; " she 'd say . And once , as a joke , she looked over her shoulder and said , " What was that ? Did I hear something ? " as if I had spoken . Then she came to where I was sitting on the couch with my book and gave my hand a squeeze . <p> Dee and Loretta looked something like sisters . They were both short and plump , with hair they wore in tightly curled perms . Dee , however , was more fair and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had the kind of voice people get from smoking since they were young . My mother invited them in , and they stood around in the kitchen , looking at the flamingo and its white bow with reverence . That morning she had dragged it from the shed into the house . The flamingo seemed much thinner and delicate out of its familiar habitat . I did not feel at ease with it like I did in the shed . Seeing the flamingo in the kitchen was like having a friend over to your house for the first time  --  a friend you 'd been so comfortable with at school , but once they enter your house , you both act differently , and you notice things about your friend that you may not have before , like they talk too much , or use a silly voice when they address your mother , or they look in your closet too long . <p> My mother and her friends stood around eating and drinking brandy out of delicate little glasses . Whenever my mother lifted her glass to her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were shivering in the heat . I stood quietly among them , but Dee and Loretta paid attention to me anyway . They petted my hair or laid their hands on my face . <p> " You 're becoming beautiful , " Dee said in her high , breathy voice . " Just like your mother . " <p> " Cat still got your tongue ? " Loretta asked with a husky guffaw . She pinched my ear and offered me a sip of her brandy , which felt like it was burning a hole straight into my heart . <p> After an hour or so , they took to the task of fitting the flamingo into the back of Loretta 's station wagon . They packed Libby 's favorite brand of scotch and some paper cups in a basket , which they gave me to hold on my lap . I noticed my mother was becoming anxious , her eyes moving a little too quickly , and once or twice filling with tears . On the ride there , she sat with me in the back scat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on my knee and looked out the window . <p> At the gravesite , they steadied the flamingo on the grass , which had grown thick and tough from the summer rains . Loretta found a rock and wedged it under the large feet on one side so it was level . They looped a string of cheap , battery-operated Christmas lights around its neck and wings , and straightened the white bow . I stayed close-by , sitting on the hood of the car , watching . <p> Dee handed out paper cups and poured scotch . She raised her glass . " Happy birthday , Libby , " she said , lifting her arm higher . " I 'm toasting this day which honors your birth "  --  she paused for a moment and thought hard , squinting into the grass at her feet  --  " because I want to remember your time here with us , alive , and how you made each of us better in some way ? " She downed her scotch then , throwing back her curly head , wiping a hand across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toasting Libby 's laugh , and the unexpected humor she found in the worst of situations . She toasted her toughness , and recalled the time Libby woke as a young man was trying to break into her house , and chased him in her silk robe clear down the street . She said that Libby was brave , and even her suicide was not something weak , but a way to die with dignity . " I know you live on ! " she shouted suddenly , looking into the sky as if she might see Libby floating there . For a moment I looked up , too , and imagined I saw Libby wearing a pink gown , with wings instead of arms . Then Loretta gulped her scotch , leaving a few drops in the bottom of the cup , which she sprinkled onto the grave near the flamingo 's feet . <p> When it was my mother 's turn , she raised her cup and said , " She always stood by me . " She bit her lip and closed her eyes . She whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry big , rolling tears down her cheeks , so that Dee and Loretta turned their backs to the flamingo and put their arms around my mother , swaying side to side . <p> Finally Loretta took a step back and pulled out a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of her long skirt . She handed one to each of them , and they smoked silently , a last tribute . No one said anything about the way my mother 's shoulders were still jerking with sobs , even though no sound was coming from her throat , or that her tears had dried in long , black trails of mascara down her face . <p> They filed back to the car , leaving the flamingo on the grave with the lights still lit . It was beginning to get dark , and the tiny lights seemed as if they were twinkling . Dee and Loretta climbed into the car , sniffling and patting their eyes , but my mother 's eyes were now dry and wide open . Her chest was rising and falling quickly , but her breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat . <p> I stood there for one last second before I climbed into the car . I felt like something bad was on the verge of happening , and yet I could n't think about anything but how beautiful the flamingo looked , glowing against the darkening summer sky . Its neck reached thin and high , its head tilted slightly down , looking toward where Libby lay . A few fireflies mingled with the colored lights , as if they were falling in love . <p> " Goodbye , " I felt I should say , but instead raised my hand as if I held a glass in it . I toasted the flamingo , silently saying thank you , and that I would miss knowing it was out in the shed night after night . I would have even gone to it and wrapped my arms around its body , but Loretta was starting the car , and in the back seat my mother was stretching a hand toward where I stood , just out of her reach . <p> By the time they dropped us off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " Dee asked as she opened the back door . " Oh , fine , " my mother said , but I could see her face doing strange things . <p> That night I stayed up late , putting food back in the refrigerator , wiping off the table and counters , standing on a footstool in front of the sink to wash the dishes and brandy glasses in warm soapy water . My mother lay in her bedroom , curled up in a ball , still in her dress . I changed into my nightgown , brushed my teeth , then went upstairs and lay on my bed . I thought of the flamingo in the graveyard . It seemed a million miles away , and I became sure that I 'd never see it again , and this thought seemed to open up that same desperate place that beat inside of me  --  the part that hoped when it knew it should n't , the part that made me want to cry when I looked into the doctor 's eyes , or saw Libby in a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of dread that I 'd been trying to ignore for days , but now it was too heavy , like a wet , woolen coat , and I could do nothing but lie there sobbing and shaking . I had been turned inside out , and I felt so completely awful that all I could do was let it happen . That 's when a broken , husky sound came to my ears ; it was like a shout being strangled , so only bits and pieces of it came out . And it took me a few seconds to realize that it was my own voice , coming from deep inside me . <p> I fell asleep then , and dreamt I could not swallow . A terrible dream of wandering around alone with my hands gripping my neck . I understood quite clearly that the blockage in my throat was a baby bird , I could feel it shuddering and chirping , and although I wanted it gone , I knew I had to feed it . I dropped flowers and tiny beetles into my mouth until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged , a tiny crow that was wet and sticky . I held it in my hand , and it looked up at me , its black eyes unblinking . <p> I woke early in the morning to yellow light slanting across the wooden floorboards of my attic bedroom . I was exhausted , my body heavy on the bed , but I pushed myself up on an elbow , then to a sitting position , and finally stood . I walked over to the night light and switched it off , as I had done every day I could remember . I opened my bedroom door , stepped through , and closed it . I was being careful , although I do n't think I knew why at the time , but now looking back , it seems I had some sort of premonition of what was about to happen . That I was about to find my mother half-naked in the bathroom , passed out but nowhere near death from the pills she had swallowed , which only amounted to half a bottle , and the one small slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the biggest vein there . <p> But still . There was my mother with her dress unzipped , exposing her shoulders and breasts , collapsed in a puddle of blood on the bathroom tile . The tub was half-filled , and the arm that was not cut was hanging into the water . I screamed then , a choked , scratchy sound , which only made her open her eyes groggily and close them . But what I screamed surprised and alarmed me , not only because I had not heard my voice for so long , but because of the word that came out of my mouth . " Mother ! " I 'd screamed . I 'd never called her " Mother , " which had always seemed formal to me . But as soon as it came out of my mouth , I knew that it was what I 'd call her from then on . <p> I went to her and lifted her hand out of the tub . Her fingers were white and shriveled . I pulled her dress up to cover the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . In the hallway , as I dialed 911 , my hands were shaking and my breathing rattled in my ears . " My mother wants to kill herself , " I whispered to the operator . Her voice was clear and calm on the other line while she asked me questions and waited through my deep breaths before each answer . After she hung up , with the promise of an ambulance on the way , I stayed there for a minute with the receiver still to my ear , because the sound of her voice had comforted me . <p> That evening a lady from the hospital took me to Miss Mildred 's house for the first of many long visits . This time it would be for two months , until my mother was finally released from the rehabilitation home where she 'd been staying . Miss Mildred 's house was large and creaky and surrounded by shady trees that rustled outside of the windows all day and night . Her clothing always smelled like lavender . She was quiet , and we took our time getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer afternoons just sitting and drinking iced tea . For dinner she 'd prepare fine meals of meat and salad , and she 'd make sure I drank a tall glass of milk . I was relieved that even though I had my voice back , I was n't being pressured to say anything at all . And on those nights when bad dreams woke me , Miss Mildred and I would sit out on her patio with blankets wrapped around us . It was there I told her what really happened in Mr. Schenley 's car . I also told her that I thought if perhaps I had come downstairs that morning and found my mother dead in the bathroom , I would n't have been so sad . Miss Mildred would wait until I was finished , and then she would pick me up and carry me back to my bed , where she 'd sit close in her lavender-scented nightgown , a hand on my forehead or check , until I slept . <p> But that 's a different story . That 's a story of being saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is the one I am trying most to remember  --  how in her hospital gown a few days later , lying in bed , she held her arms out to me as she saw me in the doorway , which a nurse gently pushed me through . My mother held her arms out to me , and I went to her . And in each step I recognized something new in myself . That I could go to my mother , stand still in her embrace , remain steady as she rocked me and wept on my shoulder , and not feel the slightest bit of hope tug at me . Even as I was taking steps toward her , I was also stepping away , my need for her already lessening . I had Miss Mildred to whisper to in the night , and soon there would be others : a babysitter named Fran who would teach me to smoke and convince me I was pretty , a dog named Buddy who would sleep on my feet in bed . There would be a high school teacher who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long poetry . A best friend named Charlotte who 'd never waver . <p> I took steps away from her my whole life , into the arms of others , until now , a grown woman , I finally want to look back . She has been dead ten years , but I have turned around to see her , understand her , write her until she is perfectly clear . And now I find something most surprising , breathtaking even . I find that I recognize her completely , there is little mystery involved . She was simply a woman in need of rest , silence , and someone , anyone , to stand beside her . <p> <p> By Elizabeth Kemper French <p>
