<p> When Martha Powell 's husband , Harvey , was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease at 54 , the Powells had n't even thought of planning for their deaths . <p> " It was the most devastating and stressful thing , " says Martha Powell , 69 , of McDonough . " We were just getting ready for retirement  --  my husband was going to retire at 55  --  and enjoying our grandchildren . One day everything 's fine , and the next our whole life is falling apart . " <p> Powell , who worked for an insurance company for nearly 33 years , quit her job to care for her husband , and called an attorney to help pull their affairs together . <p> In a matter of weeks , elder-law attorney Ira Leff of Atlanta presented them with papers that included power of attorney and medical power of attorney . The latter allowed Powell to make medical decisions for her husband . <p> " Harvey had lost so much judgment and memory by that time , " she recalls , " that his signature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Alzheimer 's and always felt he could make decisions and all of that . <p> " But after this happened , I could make decisions without involving him . I told him everything we were doing , of course . Some he comprehended , some he did not . But it had never entered my mind that I needed power of attorney to do everything , and to give doctors permission . " <p> Powell cared for her husband at home for eight years , but when he began having seizures and falling , he was moved to a nursing home . For the next five years , she went there daily to be with the man she calls " my soul mate and friend , " watching helplessly as he wasted away . <p> " He did n't call me by name for three years , " she says . " I grieved for the last five years . " <p> Harvey Powell died in January 2006 . And Martha realized there were still unresolved issues . <p> " We had a cemetery plot , " Powell says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted , or music or the minister , that sort of thing . And I want to be cremated , but when my children asked if Daddy was going to be cremated , I said no , because we 'd never discussed it . " <p> A year after Powell 's death , his widow is still contending with the aftereffects of those 13 years on her own life . " I 've got high blood pressure , heart problems and high cholesterol , " she says . " The stress can take a toll on you . " <p> But she says it would have been worse had the couple not begun planning when his illness was diagnosed . <p> " Everything went very smoothly , " she says , " even with the hospice . I still had the medical power of attorney , so I could pursue all of that . I ca n't imagine going through it without being prepared , which we almost were not . <p> " There 's no age limit to when disease or something is going to strike you or your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to be prepared , and it 's so simple to get it done . Do it while you can talk to your spouse . Make the decisions together . . . or you 'll have to do it alone when it 's too late .

Add burial liners or vaults , special transportation , flowers , obituary notices , etc. , and a funeral can easily cost $10,000 . <p> Waiting to make arrangements until the time of death almost invariably drives costs higher , says Kain . <p> " A lot of people get emotional , and they overspend , " says Kain . " It 's a horrific time , and they 're tired and overtaxed and distraught , and they do n't make good decisions .
