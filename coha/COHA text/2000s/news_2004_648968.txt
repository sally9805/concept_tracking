<p> WHEN is a job interview not an interview ? In baseball , it 's usually when a minority candidate is the interviewee . <p> The question arises now with the inclusion of Jerry Manuel among the four men the Seattle Mariners said were finalists for their managing job . That characterization came as news to Manuel . <p> The former manager of the Chicago White Sox , Manuel was the only minority candidate among the four ; Grady Little , Terry Collins and Mike Hargrove , who got the job , were the other finalists . <p> " I think they had someone in mind before the lunch , " Manuel said . " I 've noticed in the process most of the people have someone in mind , and unless you have a philosophy that knocks them over , that you pretty much do n't have a shot . I have n't seen it as being open . " <p> Manuel had lunch in Los Angeles early last month with Bill Bavasi , the Mariners ' general manager , and two of his assistants . Manuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the job . <p> " I guess you could call it an interview , " Manuel , speaking uncertainly , said by telephone . " I would assume it was more of a personal meeting , I felt , versus an interview . " <p> Did they say he was being interviewed for the job ? " I ca n't recollect the term they used , " Manuel said . " They said , ' We 're going to ask you questions even though it is n't an interview , but it is an interview . ' The way it was expressed to me was : ' We 'd like to get to know you . This is a get-to-know-you lunch . We 've already done our research . " ' <p> Manuel was asked again if he had been interviewed for the job . " I 'd have to answer no , I do n't think I was interviewed for the job , " he said . <p> Bavasi said the Mariners , by design , did not technically interview any of the four finalists . He said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided which ones they wanted to meet . Manuel , he said , was treated the same as the other three finalists . <p> " We told each guy we did n't intend it to be an interview , " Bavasi said . " We were going more on research than on interviews . Not enough is learned in interviews . We wanted to get to know them . " <p> Bavasi said he was " shocked , disappointed and angry " at Manuel 's reaction , but he added : " Everybody interprets things on his own . He 's a man of integrity . That 's what our research led us to believe . That 's how he viewed things . We accept that , but it 's disappointing . " <p> Commissioner Bud Selig has ordered clubs to include minority candidates in their interviewing process , but often clubs go through the motions with no intention of hiring them . <p> Before he was named the manager of the Mets earlier this month , Willie Randolph was interviewed for a dozen managing jobs , and many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he was supposed to be interviewed for the Colorado job , the Rockies announced that they had hired Buddy Bell , making the announcement because word had leaked to the news media . <p> " Mr. O'Dowd , " Randolph recalled , referring to Dan O'Dowd , the Rockies ' general manager , " called me and said , ' Can we do this on the phone ? " ' <p> That is not the kind of interview Selig had in mind when he issued his directive in 1999 . On the other hand , Selig said he was satisfied that the Mariners had met their obligation . <p> Hargrove , who was previously the manager with Cleveland and Baltimore , said the Mariners did not follow the standard interview process . But he said , " I think it was a very thorough process from what I understand . " <p> Hargrove said he had dinner with Bavasi and his assistants in Phoenix , talking to them for three or four hours . Part of Manuel 's doubt about the sincerity of his lunch meeting was that it lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know me in two hours , " he said . " I 'd hope they would have more depth than two hours . It was n't a thorough , philosophical thing . " <p> Losing Your Place <p> This has not been a good year for top executives of expansion teams . First , Jerry Colangelo was pushed out in Arizona , and now Jerry McMorris , who had slipped a couple of rungs on the Colorado Rockies ' executive ladder , is out , too . <p> McMorris , who was the driving force behind the Rockies in their early years in the 90 's , went from serving as the team 's chairman , president and chief executive to co-vice chairman to no position at all . He has even lost his seat on the team 's board of directors . <p> In Colangelo 's case , his new partners decided he had squandered too much money . One estimate has the Diamondbacks losing $80 million a year and in such debt to some of their players that baseball officials are concerned about their ability to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did him in , though not over exorbitant expenditures . The Monfort brothers , Charles ( chairman and chief executive ) and Richard ( the other vice chairman ) , decided they no longer needed or wanted McMorris 's aid in running the Rockies . <p> Life with the Rockies began turning sour for McMorris , who had been a good friend of the Monforts ' father , when his trucking business failed in 1999 . He retains a 12.4 percent ownership share of the Rockies , but he is seeking a buyer . <p> " I 'm shocked , " he said , clearly unhappy with Rockies developments . " I do n't know what 's going on . There 's been no explanation or anything . " <p> McMorris , who continues to operate his land and cattle businesses , said he would not preclude the possibility of returning to baseball as an investor in another team . <p> Sharing the Wealth <p> In voting on World Series shares , Boston Red Sox players were so magnanimous that they must have included players going back to 1918 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> Although calculations have not been made final , the Red Sox voted for nearly 60 full shares , as well as partial shares that would bring the total to nearly 70 . <p> By comparison , the Florida Marlins awarded 37 full shares and 29 partial shares last year . <p> A winning share for the Marlins was $305,361.77 . The players ' pool this year , $42,187,763.96 , was greater than the pool last year , $41,363,446.14 , meaning the 36 percent winners ' share of the pool for the Red Sox was slightly higher ( by $296,755 ) than the Marlins ' share of a year ago . <p> But because the Red Sox have been so generous with their awards , their individual shares will be less , closer to $225,000 . <p> Umpiring Themselves <p> The vivid pictures of six umpires gathering on the field in the postseason  --  discussing questionable calls and reversing the original calls on two occasions  --  have very likely saved baseball from instant replay . <p> Instant replay has been a topic of discussion at the annual general managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . But at the meetings last week , the general managers voted , 15-15 , on replay , the same as they did four years ago . <p> The general manager who first raised the issue has changed his mind , however . Jim Bowden , then of Cincinnati and now of Montreal/Washington , said the plays in Game 6 of the playoff series between the Yankees and the Red Sox had demonstrated that the umpires could " get it right . " <p> The umpires got it right because they conferred . Those conferences , or consultations , were a result of several years ' effort . <p> " That 's something both the umpires and management agreed was a good idea ; the idea was to get it right , " said Larry Gibson , the lawyer for the umpires union . <p> When the league umpiring staffs were merged in 2000 , Sandy Alderson , chief of baseball operations , set out to improve umpiring in certain areas . Getting calls right through consultation was one of them . <p> " It 's one of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something the umpires have done more routinely the last two , three years . " <p> Gibson said the goal of the leadership of the new union was to improve the umpires ' image . " Before this union took over , it was more every man for himself , " Gibson said . " ' I called it , I saw it and I stand by it . ' The umpires have made a concerted effort the last three , four years . " <p> Alderson , Gibson said , has said he wants the umpires to be regarded " as the most highly respected officials , " adding , " Union and management have identical objectives .
