<p> " We must turn to nature itself , to the observations of the body in health and disease , to learn the truth . "  --  Hippocrates <p> Botox for Furrowed Brow <p> Dear , Dr. SerVaas : <p> My eyelids come down too far over my eyes . Is there some surgery that will help my eyelids stay open better ? Is this best done by a general surgeon , an eye surgeon , or a plastic surgeon ? Is it necessary to have general anesthesia for this kind of surgery ? <p> I 've also heard about Botox to get rid of wrinkles in my brow . Does having Botox treatment require general anesthesia ? Harry Myers Salt Lake City , Utah <p> <p> We sent your letter to Dr. William Beeson , a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon , in Indianapolis . Dr. Beeson provides the following response : <p> " Excess skin in the upper eyelids goes by the medical term ' dermatochalasis . ' In some cases , it is so significant that it actually causes restriction of one 's vision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery estimates that over 200,000 of these procedures are done each year for cosmetic purposes . The great majority of upper lid blepharoplasty ( eye tuck ) surgeries are done under intravenous sedation ( the same type of anesthesia used for colonoscopies , etc. ) on an outpatient basis . Most men and women having upper lid blepharoplasty can resume normal work and social activities within seven days of the procedure . Blepharoplasty surgery is commonly performed by facial plastic surgeons , ophthalmologists ( eye surgeons ) , and plastic surgeons . <p> " Botox Cosmeticr is a purified protein that temporarily relaxes wrinkle-causing muscles , which , in the forehead area , can account for the fettered brow . The medication has been used by doctors worldwide for over ten years to treat spasms of the eyelids ( blepharospasms ) and muscle contractures of the neck ( torticollis ) . In April 2002 , it was officially approved by the FDA for treating the deep wrinkling between the eyebrows . <p> " It is administered through tiny injections into the forehead muscles . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their patients apply a topical ' numbing ' cream one or two hours prior to the procedure to minimize ; or eliminate , the mild ' skin-prick ' sensation associated with the treatment . Treatments take approximately ten minutes , and the effect commonly lasts three to seven months . Botox should be administered by a physician with knowledge and expertise in facial anatomy and in the aging process . " Niacin Promotes Heart Health <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> What is your opinion about taking niacin to help lower cholesterol ? I am concerned about the possible side effects of statin drugs . Niacin therapy is cheaper , too . Debbie Long Atlanta , Georgia <p> <p> We have received numerous letters from readers who successfully keep their cholesterol levels in check with inexpensive niacin therapy . One gentleman started taking niacin 40 years ago for dangerously high cholesterol levels . His LDL level gradually dropped , and today the healthy grandfather lives an active and productive life . <p> Studies show that niacin ( or nicotinic acid ) , a form of vitamin B 3 , increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inhibits the production of LDL ( bad ) cholesterol . When taken alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs , niacin helps reduce plaque in blood vessels and reduces heart attack risk . <p> Some people complain about an uncomfortable skin flushing or tingling sensation when taking niacin . Doctors say flushing is most often seen with immediate-release formulations . Taking an aspirin before ingesting intermediate- or extended-release niacin helps further reduce or eliminate the potentially bothersome effect . Familial Hypercholesterolemia <p> People with a genetic predisposition to extremely high cholesterol may be unable to lower their cholesterol levels with diet , exercise , and medicines . An emerging technology offers an alternative to families with familial hypercholesterolemia , or FH . <p> " Lipid apheresis is a way to selectively remove the bad , or LDL , cholesterol from the blood , " said Dr. Mark Deeg , director of the Lipid Apheresis Program at Indiana University and an investigator in the Indiana Center for Vascular Biology and Medicine . " It functions like a dialysis machine in terms of what happens . You put a needle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of filters takes out the fat , and the blood returns to the patient 's other arm . It is that simple . " <p> The FDA-approved treatment  --  used widely in Europe for the past 20 years  --  is now available at nearly 20 medical centers across the country . Coronary gene therapy recipient Rev. Charles Wilson says he may be a candidate for lipid apheresis when it becomes available in North Carolina . He and three of his six children have FH . <p> " Dr. Wise has talked about my having this treatment when they get the machine here in town , " he wrote in an e-mail . " I would like to know more about lipid apheresis . None of our family is involved in this therapy . " <p> Look for more on lipid apheresis in a future issue . To read more about Rev. Wilson 's successful coronary gene therapy at St. Elizabeth 's Medical Center in Boston , see " Gene Therapy : For Reverend Wilson , A Blessing , " beginning on page 34 of the March/April 2000 Post . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> I am 66 years old and have been experiencing rapid hair loss the past two years . I take Coumadin , Lopressor , Paxil , Norvasc , and Cozaar . Emil Paselor Long Island , New York <p> <p> The PDR Family Guide to Prescription Drugs lists hair loss as a " less common side effect " of Coumadin and a " less common or rare side effect " of Lopressor . The 2003 Physicians ' Desk Reference lists hair loss as an " infrequent " adverse effect of Paxil . In addition , the prescription drug manual states that hair loss occurs in less than 0.1 percent of patients on Norvasc and less than one percent of those taking Cozaar .

Use It or Lose It <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Could you explain this paradox : We 're told that you should lower your heart rate or you wear out your heart having it beat 80 beats per minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart rate in workouts , and then the heart rate for me should reach about 125 beats per minute . Why does n't this daffy increase in the heart rate equate to the same " wearing out of the heart muscle " ? Does reaching the targeted heart rate really cause the resting heart to go down enough to give fewer beats per year than before the fitness training ? Mary Simpson Tucson , Arizona <p> <p> You ask a good question . We have always wondered about this . We 've always believed in the admonition " use it or lose it , " and this seems to apply to heart muscle strength . <p> We asked our faculty exercise physiologist Kay Mikesky for an answer . She writes : <p> " When you exercise aerobically , you are training your heart to become a more efficient pump . You are also training your muscles to extract oxygen more efficiently . The target heart rate zone in which you train with walking , running , swimming , biking , etc. , does in fact elevate into the 130 to 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 minutes or more of challenging your heart and lungs is a lower heart rate for the remainder of the day and night . Aerobic exercise can claim the benefit of making your heart stronger and more efficient , not weaker and ready to wear out . " Bipolar Disease and Pregnancy <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> After severe bouts of depression and mania , I was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder at age 27 and was put on lithium . Then I fell in love and married at age 30 . When I became pregnant , I was concerned about the adverse effects on the fetus and the concept of the lithium babies registry and stopped taking lithium against my psychiatrist 's advice . Despite his dire predictions , I was OK all during pregnancy , birth , and breastfeeding without the drug . The psychiatrist told me that people could have " years of normalcy sandwiched between episodes " but that the disorder would always return . I nursed my son for three years , then became pregnant again . I nursed my second son for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've had no episodes and have been drug free since 1988 . <p> Can pregnancy and breastfeeding change your brain 's chemistry permanently ? Is it possible to " outgrow " bipolar disorder ? name withheld via e-mail <p> <p> Thank you for your letter . We 're always glad to hear about happy endings . We are sending your letter to Dr. John Nurnberger to see if he has any information about the hormones of pregnancy and bipolar . I 'm sure your case history will add to his vast knowledge of this perplexing disease . <p> To help shed light on bipolar , we suggest you read Kay Redfield Jamison 's definitive books on bipolar and then get a copy of Lizzie Simon 's book Detour . Dr. Jamison and Miss Simon were not as fortunate as you . In their cases , bipolar created havoc in their early years . They overcame their afflictions and are now helping others . <p> The Post has published articles about bipolar that can now be obtained from the SatEvePost Web site .

Hormone Replacement Therapy <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I 'm a 49-year-old female in menopause and have taken 0.625 mg daily of Premarin for just one year . I had so many severe symptoms a year ago , and the HRT has helped me tremendously . However , my mother had a radical mastectomy two years ago at age 75 . She was told her breast cancer was estrogen induced . I have recently moved to a new area , and my new gynecologist wants to take me off Premarin and put me on tamoxifen for five years to prevent breast cancer and put me on Bellergal S for my hot flashes and night sweats . I 've done some research , and these two drugs have some pretty bad side effects of their own , and neither will keep my " female parts " from atrophying again like they were prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premarin really works for me , but I 'm afraid of breast cancer . Any suggestions ? August Arvin via e-mail <p> <p> Dr. Marguerite Shepard , an endocrinologist at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis , responds to your question : <p> " Your question and the response of your new doctor are understandable in light of the interim report of the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) published in July 2002 . One crucial determining factor is the status of your reproductive organs . Since you only mention taking Premarin , have you had a hysterectomy ? This would make a significant difference in the recommendation at this time . The WHI consisted of two arms , one for women with a uterus who were being treated with Prempro and one for women who were without a uterus and being treated with Premarin alone . The women in the Prempro arm had an increase in heart disease and stroke in the first year of treatment . There was also a trend toward an increase in breast cancer , but this was not statistically significant . These findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . The Premarin arm is still ongoing . Previous studies regarding estrogen and breast cancer indicate an increased risk only if the estrogen treatment Is continued for more than five years . Since your mother did not develop breast cancer until she was 75 , it is unlikely that your risk will be increased with short-term use ( less than five years ) . Hot flushes in most women are most severe in the first year or two after menopause . No woman with severe hot flushes was recruited for the WHI . <p> " Estrogen preparations are far and away the best treatment for hot flushes . Most other treatments  --  including bellergal , clonidine and , recently , Neurontin  --  have significant side effects and are not as effective as estrogen in relieving the hot flushes . Premarin comes in a lower dose than 0.625 mg . You could try dropping the dose to see if you still had relief . There are other forms of estrogen available both in pill form and skin patch that come in lower doses that your body might absorb better than Premarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , there are vaginal estrogen tablets that have very little absorption into the bloodstream that could give you local vaginal relief , even if you stopped taking the oral estrogen . <p> " Your best course in the long run might be to switch to raloxifene ( Evista ) , which has been shown to reduce the incidence of estrogen-dependent breast cancers but also protects against osteoporosis . It can be taken for an indefinite period of time , but like tamoxifen it causes an increase in hot flushes . It can be used in conjunction with the vaginal estrogen tablet . I would recommend using some form of estrogen to take care of the severe flushing that you are experiencing now . After you have established a significant comfort level , you could try to decrease the dose of estrogen and gradually introduce tamoxifen or raloxifene and either start or continue the vaginal estrogen tablet . Current recommendations are to prescribe estrogen for relief of vasomotor symptoms ( hot flushes , night sweats , and sleep disturbance ) in as low a dose as possible and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From your letter , it appears that you have barely established your comfort level . Quality of life is important . Whatever you decide to do regarding a change , I would counsel you to do it gradually , rather than abruptly , to decrease the chance that you will have the severe symptoms that you had before starting Premarin . " Suggestions to Relieve Swallowing Problem <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> In your Jan. /Feb. 2003 Post , a Mrs. John E. Grevish asked for help about a swallowing problem . My experience with weak swallowing muscles was a magnesium deficiency . Might this solve her husband 's problem , even though the cause was not the same ? Bernadine Bailey Grants Pass , Oregon <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Mrs. John Grevish should contact Marcy Freed at University Hospital in Cleveland . She has a swallowing clinic .

Herman Black Decatur , Georgia <p> Reader Remedies for Mouth Sores <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I am responding to De Etta Myers ' letter in the March/April 2003 issue . I had a similar problem with mouth sores in ' 98 , and in 1999 a Kathleen Mutach wrote , " Bless Vitamin B 12 " I finally got a doctor to do a blood B 12 analysis on me , and I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia . Since then I have taken a B 12 shot once a month and will continue for the rest of my life . This is common in people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors know about this . Also , my doctor put me on Magic Mouthwash , a compound that must be mixed by a druggist . It is marvelous ! I use this as needed when sores first appear , but by now I have very few . Nancy Piersol Miami , Florida <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> Many years ago , when I was about 36 , I began having gum problems and small ulcers . My dentist advised me to get Allbee tablets and begin taking them as directed , for they would help my problem . He emphasized " Allbee with C , remember ! " <p> So , I did as he told me then . I have never had mouth sores since . Marjorie Baggett Helene , Alabama <p> <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas : <p> I had a problem with mouth sores several years ago , and a periodontist gave me a prescription to relieve the pain : Kenalog in Orabase to apply when a sore appeared inside the mouth . <p> Then I read about lysine being helpful for this type of problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to strengthen the mouth membranes , and I have conquered the problem now for many years .
