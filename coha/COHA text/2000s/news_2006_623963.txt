<p> ' Golden Hills ' brings back fond memories <p> Editor  --  Jonah Raskin 's column " The Golden Hills  --  now home " ( Jan. 14 ) brought back so many precious memories of hiking the hills of Southern California when I was a kid . <p> My brother and I would come home smelling of sage and the tangy , herbaceous scent of eucalyptus and dust . My father , who used to read short evocative pieces such as this aloud , would have loved reading this to us and sharing memories of his own hikes in the hills when he was young and the hills were covered in brush , not houses . <p> I will mail this to my mother and we will talk of those times when he read to us , and we will be loving our home , and my father . <p> JANE MEYERS <p> Napa <p> Thanks for warning Editor  --  Thank you for Deborah Rich 's article , " The Case Against Synthetic Fertilizers " ( Jan. 14 ) . We appreciate finding things out such as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas is used to make synthetic fertilizer . This genuinely interesting information answered many questions . <p> KATHY GREINKE <p> Berkeley <p> Editor  --  The article on synthetic fertilizers was good but misinformed in places and in need of some assistance in others . One of the more interesting studies that came out about five years ago was a 10,000-sampling-points study on carbon that took place in the Amazon basin over a 10-year period . For thoughtful students of the nitrogen questions , this study flipped over conventional thinking that indicated that plants could use only inorganic nitrogen . The Amazon study confirmed that in a natural state  --  largely untouched by humans  --  organic nitrogen was the primary source of nitrogen nutrition for plants . In such an area , 70 percent of nitrogen was organic in nature and 30 percent inorganic . Earlier studies , conducted in areas around which people had operated steam engines , power plants and other users of burned hydrocarbons , had shown the opposite  --  that the organic nitrogen was 30 percent and the inorganic nitrogen was 70 percent . Much of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on its head . This has profound implications for growers , as their model for providing nutrition to their plants is obviously flawed . <p> While the article struck at most of the obvious problems associated with nitrogen fertilizers , it missed the largest . Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers have a terrible , deep , dark secret that the article failed to uncover . It renders all the other ills listed together puny in destructive capacity . <p> In the soil , there is a carbon to nitrogen ratio . Literature about composting shows that ratio is a critical aspect of composting , as it controls the rate of decomposition in the soil . Added nitrogen , either synthetic or organic , accelerates composting . The reason is simple . The microbes that cause decomposition rely on nitrogen for the fuel that drives their reproduction and mass . No nitrogen  --  little in the way of decomposition . <p> Carbon , mainly in the form of soil acid gels , is the " glue " that holds soil together . These gels are formed by bacteria and fungi from the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gels are made in the top layer of the soil , and they do not migrate . Their functions include holding nutrients for use by plants , rendering minerals into chelated ionic forms that plants can use and holding these forms in storage until used . Up to 98 percent of the forms of these gels is moisture . They act as a sponge in the soil to attract and hold moisture for use by plants . Most important , soil acids seal the earth in a manner not unlike the action of rain gear made with the newly developed fabrics that breathe but do not allow moisture to quickly penetrate . <p> These gels are the first line of defense to prevent soils from becoming sand and subject to erosion . In the same manner that nitrogen accelerates the destruction of green waste into compost , over-application of nitrogen acts to destroy the soil acid gels . The amount of carbon decreases in the soil when this happens . Soil without soil acid gels turns into sand or a clay dust . The soil becomes subject to wind , rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USDA tells us that we have lost 50 percent of our topsoil in the United States . Perhaps it is a mere coincidence that the use of synthetic nitrogen began and continues during that period . I do n't think so . With farmers ' increasing demands and growth based on increased applications of nitrogen , a vicious cycle begins . More nitrogen  --  less moisture holding carbon in the soil . In the face of decreasing yields , the farmer pours on more nitrogen . The soil gels further decrease . More nitrogen and of course more water are needed , as the soil has lost its moisture-holding mechanism . The downward spiral continues until there is sand and erosion . The land is abandoned to pasture and farming ceases . <p> JOHN MARLER <p> Perfect Blend Organics <p> Seattle <p> Looking for wolves Editor  --  People worry about the screwiest things : wolves , white sharks , etc . I 've spent some major time in or on the ocean , swimming , diving , surfing , and likewise in the wilds , hiking in California , Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never seen a wolf in the wild or a white shark , great or small . <p> I swim in the Pacific Ocean six days every week and I 've been doing these things for a while too , as I 'm now 77 , and I have n't been fortunate enough to see either one of these beautiful species . <p> Hollywood will do anything to make a buck , and as long as fools will pay money to see movies like " Jaws , " they 'll keep crankin ' ' em out . The article " Wolf attack a tragic , cautionary tale " ( Jan. 14 ) was excellent . <p> BOB THOMPSON <p> Honolulu <p> Editor  --  Thanks for the objectivity and perspective . I wonder if two other variables are not worth mentioning for the sake of safety for both wild animals and people . <p> The buddy system : I 've hiked wilderness areas in Yosemite alone , and swam in the ocean alone , and I know that it 's not smart . <p> Guns : Before all of the modern gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed in North America , and that could explain why more people were not attacked , as they could use their gun to scare away animals . And for those 27 who were attacked by wolves , they must have fought them off to survive , and I 'm sure that 's a story we 'd rather hear than experience . <p> Ironically , our modern society 's conflicting values of protecting wildlife and banning guns seems to put people on a rather predictable collision course with animals who , as the article noted , are just doing what comes natural to them . <p> Bear stories may be the most common ; there were times when I was so scared that I 'd swear I could hear a bear breathing over my head while I was in my sleeping bag . I 'm almost positive it was only imagination . But what we did to protect ourselves and our food was to set the food in a bag covered with metal pans so if it was disturbed , we 'd hear the alarm . We each had a shillelagh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big laugh out of watching my reaction when a bear knocked over a cup on the log near me . <p> Another time we were hiking when we saw two small cubs run up a tree just like in the movies . We did n't see mama bear until we turned our heads back toward the trail in front of us  --  it was amazing how we neither saw her , nor heard her move , then there she was blocking our path , and this one was really big . <p> I wanted to take a photo so at least if we did n't make it out alive , there 'd be proof of why . My camera was around my neck , so I tried to get a picture , but I was pretty nervous , so I only tried one , then we very slowly moved away into the woods and made a detour . <p> On another trip we were hiking home when I stopped to adjust my load while my fiancee continued ahead . She came across an older cinnamon-colored cub who ran by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared it would get me . I heard her scream and I was there in a minute . <p> About five minutes later , as we continued down the trail , I heard a noise and turned left to see the biggest black bear rear end about 20 feet away down the hill , at which time I whispered , " Hilsa , say nothing and keep walking . " Fortunately for us , that bear was intent on following something that was more interesting to it than us , and she never saw it . Her friends still express wonder that she later married me . <p> TONY VERREOS <p> Brisbane <p> Rat parties <p> Editor  --  I had a similar problem and a similar response as the author of " Rats ! Co-existing with them is for the birds " ( Jan. 7 ) . We came home from camping last summer to find that parties of rats had eaten through our heating ducts and other spots to get into the house . I had not controlled the problem , and according to the " rat professionals , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation unless stopped . I trapped them , or rather had a professional do it , with peanut butter and bird seed and an indoor trap . <p> JANE CUNNINGHAM <p> San Anselmo Poppies bloom on the parched hillside overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge in the heat of summer . / The Chronicle 1994
