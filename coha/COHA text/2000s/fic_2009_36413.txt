Two long blasts on the whistle , each bent in the middle by the wind on the river . It seemed to be shrieking his name . <p> " Well , they 'll know we 're coming . " Mary Parker took her fingers from her ears . <p> " I think they know already . " <p> Spotting the crowd on the dock , she drew in little Charlie and huddled closer to her husband . " Have they come with baskets of flowers or buckets of tar ? " <p> " They 're empty-handed . Come to see the carpetbagger . " <p> " How soon can you prove them wrong ? " <p> " Soon . I have my predecessor to thank for heightening the contrast . " <p> " They cried for his impeachment . " <p> " I studied his record . He 's fortunate they did n't dangle him from his own scaffold . " <p> " I should think a town with a fort would be an orderly place . " <p> " The fort is closed . The town has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> When the steamboat bumped against the hempbound pilings , the crowd eased back to allow the hands to erect the gangplank and bear trunks and portmanteaux to the dock for passengers to claim . Some newcomers were greeted and borne away amidst jabber , others escaped interest , looking for porters and transportation . Most of those gathered watched as Isaac and Mary Parker and their small son alighted . They saw a man in excess of six feet tall and two hundred pounds , wearing a sandy Vandyke beard , a soft hat , and a duster to protect his gray suit from cinders , accompanied by a large woman near his age in gloves , a cape , and a hat secured with a scarf under her chin . Patent-leather shoes showed beneath the hem of her skirt . The boy , in necktie , cap , and knickerbockers , had a high complexion and kept close to his parents , although not from fear ; he intercepted the curious glances of strangers with his father 's level blue gaze . <p> " Your honor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a man close to his own thirty-seven years , pale-eyed and neatly barbered , in a frock coat too heavy for the season , but he gripped Parker 's hand with a dry palm . <p> " You 're the first to address me so . " <p> " William Clayton , chief prosecutor . " He bowed to Mary and acknowledged the child with a nod but no interest . " Welcome to Fort Smith . " <p> It was a hot Sunday in early May . The family and Clayton boarded a waiting phaeton , sat with hands folded while the Negro driver and a porter secured their luggage , and rode down a broad street harrowed by hooves and carriage wheels to a fine dust that rose in clouds like flour and cast a scrim over a town built largely of unpainted wood , with neither sidewalks nor lamps to illuminate the streets at night . The saloons were shuttered for the sabbath , but wagons and horses lined the hitching rails , and stragglers from the dock dodged heavy oncoming traffic to run alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver 's shoulder with his stick and he picked up the pace , leaving the rubbernecks behind but raising still more dust . Mary drew a handkerchief from her sleeve and held it to her nose and mouth . <p> " Isaac "  --  her voice was muffled , but still she lowered it a notch  --  " we 've made a great mistake . " <p> He patted her other hand . " No , Mary . We are faced with a great task . These people need us . We must not fail them . " <p> Clayton spoke , distracting Mary 's attention from a row of bright petticoats fluttering from a second-floor balcony like the flags of many nations . " No school yet , Mrs. Parker , but we hope to remedy that by the time the lad 's old enough . " <p> " He 's seen our nation 's capital and much of the continent in between , " she said . " His education began early . " <p> " How soon may I inspect the garrison ? " asked Parker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome the early start . Many of the prisoners have waited months for their cases to come to trial , and eighteen are charged with capital offenses . If you can convene by the end of this month at the earliest , you just may clear the docket in time for Independence Day . " <p> " As late as that ? " <p> " Judge Story kept an untidy desk . " <p> " I 've heard it was worse than that . " <p> " That 's the popular view , but I would n't cast it about up at the court house . It 's a Democratic stronghold and , begging your honor 's pardon , you 're an appointee of President Grant . Moreover  --  " He faltered , cleared his throat . <p> " I 'm a turncoat . Everyone 's aware of my original party affiliation , Mr. Clayton . The decision to switch has given me unique insight . I intend to keep politics out of my courtroom . I 'd as soon hang a Republican as a Democrat . " <p> " Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , my dear . " <p> " People hereabouts would pay to see a thing like that , " Clayton said . <p> " I understand they did . " <p> " Judge Story suffered from sloth more than greed , although he had a chronic case of that as well . In fourteen months he managed to run up an expense bill of four hundred thousand . " <p> " The taxpayers should be grateful he did n't show more initiative . " <p> " At this point it 's impossible to distinguish between simple attrition due to gross negligence and bald-faced theft . The Eighth is a big jurisdiction : all of the Western District of Arkansas and the Indian Nations , including places few white men have ever set foot on , and them that have you would n't want to meet out in the open . Prussia 's smaller . A great deal can pass unnoticed in a responsibility that size . If Story was half as corrupt as he was incompetent , he could have made the Tweed Ring look like a First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an honest man to begin to make sense of it all . " <p> " Please be prepared to plead your most pressing cases a week from tomorrow . " <p> The prosecutor 's eyes flickered , the irises scarcely darker than the whites . " I do n't see how you can do it , and neither will you once you 've had a look about . " <p> Three-year-old Charles Parker tugged at his father 's sleeve . " Papa , when may we see the gallows ? " <p> " It 's the damnedest assignment any man ever undertook , or ever will , " Clayton said . " All your judgments are final , hanging and all , with no appeal between you and Almighty God  --  not counting the president , who considering the human offal you 'll be passing sentence on would n't touch it with a poker . It 's instant history ; and if you do it the way it needs to be done , it 'll be the death of you . " <p> " Are you attempting to frighten me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ought to know what he 's harnessing himself up to . My motives are less than Christian . We 're to be partners , and a thing done no more than halfway by the one must be done one hundred and fifty percent by the other . I 'm ambitious , but I ai n't suicidal . " <p> Parker 's face registered disapproval of the deliberate lapse in grammar . His wife and son were unpacking in the Hotel Le Flore . Judge and prosecutor were seated in what was to be his chambers , a small square room barely large enough to contain a black walnut desk the size of a dining table , three tufted-leather chairs , shelves , and a credenza , with nary a horizontal surface not piled high with papers and bursting portfolios bearing witness to the disorganization of the previous administration . The curling leaves seemed to defy gravity , scaling the walls from floor to ceiling , their yellowed corners stirring in the breeze through the open window . Notwithstanding that , the air was stagnant , redolent of tobacco long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigars the pair was smoking . A revolving bookcase leaned drunkenly to one side , stuffed with mustard-colored bound case histories with the hangdog look of children neglected and forgotten . A mausoleum of justice overlooked ; a dead plant in a dry pot . <p> " Equal and exact justice , " Parker said , when that image came to him . " Jefferson 's words . If we can keep them in mind , we can dispense with everything else . " <p> " Jefferson was a Democrat . " <p> " What of it ? Lincoln was a Republican . Together they freed millions . In any event , this is an oasis in the political desert . I explained that once . " The judge broke two inches of ash into a heavy brass tray that performed double duty as a paperweight . " Thank you for the tour . My family and I will establish quarters in the commissary . Will you have someone see it 's made ready as soon as possible ? I do n't wish to burden the electorate with a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll attend to it . What did you think of the jail ? " <p> Parker repressed a shudder . He 'd served in Congress and fought with the Home Guard under Rosecrans , but the atrocities he 'd witnessed were little more than an anteroom to the dungeon beneath his feet , separated into two sections by a stone wall that extended up through the ground floor , with prisoners sprawled on rough concrete , some in shackles , buckets for sanitary use . The stench was a permanent fixture . The rest of the building , two brick stories that had sheltered officers during garrison days , devoted half the surface level to court proceedings , the rest to the handmaidens of justice . <p> The judge addressed a different subject , somewhat to Clayton 's surprise ; the attorney had placed him as a humanitarian , who would at least inquire about the possibillity of constructing a proper jail . " The scaffold , " he said . " Is it as sound as it appears ? " <p> " It would take a charge of powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning and survived . " <p> This arrangement was visible through the window at a distance of three hundred yards . It stood fourteen feet high on the site of the old powder magazine , extended for twenty feet , and supported a twelve-by twelve-inch beam suitable for hanging a dozen condemned men simultaneously . <p> " So far it 's served only one , " Clayton went on ; " a half-breed named Childers , who slit an old man 's throat for his horse . Old Judge Caldwell commissioned a substantial example of architecture to inspire fear in the territory . He underestimated the highwaymen 's resolve . Here in town they call it Sam Grant 's wash line . " <p> " Who is responsible for it ? " <p> " Jim Fagan , whom you 'll meet presently . He 's U.S. marshal , and your chief law enforcement officer . I believe he assigns a man from time to time to apply whitewash and inspect it for termites . " <p> " The executioner should see to that . " <p> " At present we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should . I want to see personnel records on everyone who serves this court . " <p> " I recommend you requisition a shovel . " Clayton swept an arm along the mountain range of paper that surrounded them . <p> Someone knocked . Parker raised his voice , inviting the visitor inside . The door opened , admitting a small , narrow-gauged man in a blue uniform with a Sam Browne belt . He looked at the judge briefly , then at Clayton , and removed his forage cap . Strands of silver glittered in his broom-shaped whiskers and a shelf of brow left his eyes in deep shadow . <p> " Sir , we had a disturbance . I feared you may have heard it . " <p> " What sort of disturbance ? " asked Parker , before the prosecutor could respond . <p> When the man hesitated , Clayton said , " George Maledon , meet Judge Isaac Parker . Maledon 's a deputy sheriff , helps out downstairs . " <p> Maledon faced Parker . " Man threw his slops at a turnkey . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hip . <p> " You shot him ? " asked Clayton . <p> " No , sir , I used the other end . Doc Du Val says he 'll live . " <p> " Very well . We do n't want another incident so soon after the last . " To Parker : " Maledon shot an escaping prisoner last month . A single ball through the heart from a rifle . " <p> " What is your experience ? " Parker asked . <p> " Before this billet I was a policeman in Fort Smith five years . " <p> " Would you consider resigning from the county and accepting a position in charge of executions in this district ? " <p> Two tiny points of light guttered deep in the other 's skull . " I would for a fact , " he said . " Your honor . " <p> Excerpted from THE BRANCH AND THE SCAFFOLD by LOREN D. ESTLEMAN Copyright 2009 by Loren D.
