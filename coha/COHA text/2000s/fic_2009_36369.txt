" Do n't get , " I said as I heard the ringtone of our apartment phone . Call it a premonition , paranoia , but something about that sound severed every comfortable feeling I had managed to stitch around myself . <p> " It 's a 281 number , " my boyfriend Dane said , sautTing tofu in a pan , dumping in a can of organic tomato sauce . Dane was a vegan , which meant we used soy protein in place of ground beef in our chili . It was enough to make any native-born Texan cry , but for Dane 's sake I was trying to get used to it . " I can see it on the caller ID . " <p> 281 . Houston . Those three digits were enough to start me hyperventilating . " It 's either my mother or my sister , " I said desperately . " Let the machine pick up . " I had n't spoken to either of them in at least two years . <p> Ring . <p> Pausing in the act of stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dane said , " You ca n't run away from your fears . Is n't that what you always tell your readers ? " <p> I was an advice columnist for Vibe , a magazine about relation-ships and sex and urban culture . My column , called " Ask Miss Independent , " had started at a student-run publication , and I had quickly developed a following . Upon graduating , I 'd taken Miss In de pen dent to Vibe , and they offered me a weekly feature . Most of my advice was posted publicly , but I also sent private paid-for replies to those who requested it . To supplement my income , I also did occasional freelancing for women 's magazines . <p> " I 'm not running away from my fears , " I told Dane . " I 'm running away from my relatives . " <p> Ring . <p> " Just pick it up , Ella . You always tell people to face their problems . " <p> " Yes , but I prefer to ignore mine and let them fester . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh God . It 's Mom . " <p> Ring . <p> " Go on , " Dane said . " What 's the worst that could happen ? " <p> I stared at the phone with fearful loathing . " In the space of thirty seconds , she could say something that would send me back to therapy indefinitely . " <p> Ring . <p> " If you do n't find out what she wants , " Dane said , " you 'll worry about it all night . " <p> I let out an explosive breath and snatched up the phone . " Hello ? " <p> " Ella . This is an emergency ! " <p> To my mother , Candy Varner , everything was an emergency . She was a shock-and-awe parent , the ultimate drama queen . But she had covered it up so adeptly that few people suspected what went on behind closed doors . She had demanded her daughters ' collusion in the myth of our happy family life , and Tara and I had given it to her without question . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but she quickly became impatient and surly . We learned to watch for every sign that would indicate the fluctuations of her mood . We had been storm chasers , trying to stay close to the twister without getting swept up in it . <p> I headed to the living room , away from Dane and the clatter of pans . " How are you , Mom ? What 's going on ? " <p> " I just told you . An emergency ! Tara came to visit today . Just appeared with no warning . She has a baby . " <p> " Her own baby ? " <p> " What would she be doing with someone else 's baby ? Yes , it 's hers . You did n't know she was pregnant ? " <p> " No , " I managed to say , groping for the back of the sofa . I propped myself against it , half-sitting , half-leaning . I felt sick to my stomach . " I did n't . We have n't been in touch . " <p> " When was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? Have you thought about either of us , Ella ? Your only family ? Do we have any place on your list of priorities ? " <p> I was struck mute , my heart pounding like a dryer full of wet sneakers as an awful-familiar feeling from my childhood settled over me . But I was no longer a child . Reminding myself that I was a woman with a college degree , a career , a steady boyfriend , and a circle of good friends , I managed to answer calmly , " I sent cards . " <p> " They were n't sincere . That last Mother 's Day card did n't say one word about all the things I did for you while you were growing up . All the happy times . " <p> I clasped my hand to my forehead in the hopes that it would keep my brain from exploding . " Mom , is Tara there now ? " <p> " Would I be calling you if she was ? She  --  " My mother was cut off by the angry wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear what I 'm dealing with ? She left it here , Ella ! She 's gone ! What am I supposed to do ? " <p> " Did she say when she was coming back ? " <p> " No . " <p> " And there was no guy with her ? Did she say who the father was ? " <p> " I do n't think she knows . She has ruined her life , Ella . No man will ever want her after this . " <p> " You might be surprised , " I said . " A lot of unmarried women have babies nowadays . " <p> " There 's still a stigma . You know what I went through to keep that from happening to you and Tara . " <p> " After your last husband , " I said , " I think we would have preferred the stigma . " <p> Her tone turned icy . " Roger was a good man . That marriage would have lasted if you and Tara had ever learned to get along with him . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loved you girls , and you never gave him a chance . " <p> I rolled my eyes . " Roger loved us a little too much , Mom . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " We had to sleep with a chair wedged against the door to keep him out of our bedroom at night . And I do n't think he was planning to straighten our covers . " <p> " That 's all in your own mind . No one believes you when you say things like that , Ella . " <p> " Tara believes me . " <p> " She does n't remember anything about Roger , " my mother informed me triumphantly . " Not anything at all . " <p> " Does that strike you as normal , Mom ? To have large episodes of your childhood blocked out completely ? Do n't you think she should remember something about Roger ? " <p> " I think it 's a sign that she 's been doing drugs or drinking . Those things run on your father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childhood trauma or abuse . Mom , are you sure Tara did n't just go to the store ? " <p> " Yes , I 'm sure . She left a goodbye note . " <p> " Have you tried her cell phone ? " <p> " Of course I did ! She wo n't answer . " My mother was nearly choking with impatience . " I gave up the best years of my life taking care of you . I 'm not going through it again . I 'm too young to have a grandbaby . I do n't want anyone to know about this . You come get it before anyone sees him , Ella ! Do something with this baby or I 'll give it to Social Services . " <p> I blanched as I heard the edge in her voice , knowing it was n't an empty threat . " Do n't do anything , " I said . " Do n't give the baby to anyone . I 'll be there in a few hours . " <p> " I 'm going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkly . <p> " I 'm sorry , Mom . I 'm coming . I 'm leaving right now . Just hold down the fort . Wait , okay ? " <p> The phone clicked . I was anxious and trembling , the air-conditioned breeze glancing off my neck and making me shiver . <p> A baby , I thought miserably . Tara 's baby . <p> I trudged into the kitchen . " Until this moment , " I said , " I thought the worst thing that could happen to night was your cooking . " <p> Dane had taken the skillet off the burner . He was pouring something bright orange into a martini glass . Turning , he handed it to me , his green eyes warm with friendly sympathy . " Have some . " <p> I took a swallow of gingery-sweet gruel and grimaced . " Thanks . I was just thinking I needed a good stiff slug of carrot juice . " I set aside the glass . " But I 'd better take it easy . I have to drive tonight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calmness of him , the sanity of him , was like being wrapped in a soft blanket . He was casually handsome , blond , and lean , with the perpetual toasted-and-salted scruffiness of someone who had just come in from the beach . Most of the time Dane dressed in denim and hemp and enviro-sandals , as if he were perpetually ready for a spontaneous trip to some equatorial region . If you 'd asked Dane to describe his perfect vacation , it would have been some survivalist trek through an exotic jungle , equipped with only a nylon water bag and a pocket knife . <p> Although Dane had never met my mother or sister , I had told him a lot about them , furtively unearthing memories like fragile artifacts . It was n't easy to talk about my past , any part of it . I had managed to trust Dane with the basics : my parents had divorced and my father had left us when I was five . All I heard of my dad after that was that he had gotten a new wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tara and me in his second time around . <p> Regardless of his failure as a dad , I could hardly blame him for wanting to escape . It bothered me , however , that my father knew what kind of parent he had left us alone with . Maybe he reasoned that daughters were better off with their mothers . Maybe he had hoped my mother would get better over time . Or maybe he feared one or both of his daughters would turn out exactly like her , and that was not something he could handle . <p> There had been no significant man in my life until I had met Dane at the University of Texas . He was always gentle , reading my signals , never demanding too much . He made me feel safe for the first time ever . <p> And yet for all that , there was something missing between us , something that nagged at me like a pebble that had worked its way into my shoe . What ever that missing thing was , it kept Dane and me from reaching absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dane put a warm hand on my shoulder . The shaky-cold feeling began to subside . " From what I was able to hear , " Dane said , " Tara dumped off a surprise baby with your mother , who 's planning to sell it on eBay . " <p> " Social Ser vices , " I said . " She has n't thought of eBay yet . " <p> " What does she expect you to do ? " <p> " She wants me to take the baby off her hands , " I said , wrapping my arms around myself . " I do n't think she 's given much thought to anything beyond that . " <p> " No one knows where Tara is ? " <p> I shook my head . <p> " Want me to go with you ? " he asked gently . <p> " No , " I said , almost before he could finish the question . " You have too much to do here . " Dane had started his own environmental monitoring equipment company , and business was expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult for him to take the time off . " Besides , " I said , " I do n't know how long it will take to find Tara , or what shape she 'll be in when I do . " <p> " What if you get stuck with this kid ? No , let me rephrase  --  what are you going to do to avoid being stuck with this kid ? " <p> " Maybe I could just bring it here for a few days ? Just long enough to  --  " <p> Dane was shaking his head firmly . " Do n't bring it here , Ella . No babies . " <p> I gave him a dark look . " What if it were a baby polar bear or a baby Galpagos penguin ? I bet you 'd want it then . " <p> " I 'd make an exception for endangered species , " he allowed . <p> " This baby is endangered . It 's with my mother . " <p> " Go to Houston and take care of the situation . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dane paused and added firmly , " Alone . " Turning to the stove , he picked up the pan of veggie sauce and dumped it over a bowl of whole-grain pasta . He sprinkled shredded soy cheese over the top . " Eat something before you go  --  this 'll give you sustained energy . " <p> " No , thanks , " I said . " I 've lost my appetite . " <p> A wry grin crossed his lips . " Like hell you have . Ten minutes after you leave , you 're heading to the drive-through window of the nearest Whataburger . " <p> " You think I 'd cheat on you ? " I demanded with all the innocent outrage I could muster . <p> " With another guy , no . With a cheeseburger . . . in a heartbeat .
