WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER died without telling him she would , the boy was twelve and tried not to think about it . When he thought about it , he saw how alone he was , and how thinking about it helped make it so . And if he was alone , who was there to protect him from what wanted to kill him , what could not stand the idea that he existed - the idea that he was , as his grandmother had believed , a boy who deserved to exist ? <p> It was better not to think of her at all ; or if he had to , to think only about the four times she had saved him from the evil , and not the night she 'd died in her bed two rooms away without his knowing it , dying not because , as the doctors said , " Her heart just stopped - it happens , " but because what wished to kill him wished her dead , too , and so her heart had stopped . <p> So he tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - reminded him every day that she was dead . <p> Your grandmother is dead , John . <p> I hope you have not forgotten her . <p> I hope you remember how much she loved you . <p> It was as if his mother knew that by forgetting what he had lost - the one who could save him - he might feel safer ; and this , he knew , his mother did not want . <p> When he was little and his grandmother first came to live with them in Florida , where his father was stationed with the Navy , the boy would go to the beach with her . She liked to paint seascapes , and he would play at her feet while she painted . She gave him his own easel - a little one just his size , which she herself had bought - and brushes , water cup , and paint ; but before long he would tip the cup over , get sand in the paint or on the brush , and wander away to play with his bucket at sea 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of driftwood that looked like animals . <p> One day he picked up a purple balloon someone had left on the wet sand , and within seconds he was crying from the pain , running to his grandmother , who held him in her big lap and told him what the purple balloon was , how even when they die the man-of-war jellyfish can sting you . <p> Another morning , as he sat in the shade of her umbrella - with no one else on the beach - he looked up to find the sea rushing out like a draining bathtub and , far beyond it , a wall of water so high it looked like a mountain coming toward them - a mountain with a face , one he knew . This would be the first time his grandmother would save him . <p> As the great wave approached , his grandmother , though her knee hurt her , made a quick pattern in the air , grunted something that sounded like " Wind and Sea and You and Me , " and picked him up - brushes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwind - lifting him high into the sky , high as the gulls , high above the wall of water as if she had wings he could not see , coming down again , the two of them , upright and dry , only when the wall and its face had passed and the beach was covered with little pools of water and the gulls were starting to return , looking for stranded fish , dead crabs , and whatever else the wave had left . <p> As she drove them home in her Pontiac - which always made him think of a big pale-green frog - she pretended nothing had happened , that she had n't flown up higher than two houses and saved him from the evil that wanted to take him . " What wave , Johnny ? " she said , but there was a twinkle in her eye , one that told him she knew and that he did n't need to ask again . They would n't tell his mother , of course . <p> When they got home , his mother , a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where have you two been ? John looks sunburned . " <p> " You know where , Dorothy , " his grandmother said with a smile . " Where we always go . " <p> His mother did n't like the answer , the boy could tell . <p> " For so long ? " his mother said . <p> " Painting the sea takes time , Dorothy . " <p> When the boy looked at his mother 's eyes , he saw them flash , saw something dark and glittering coil for an instant in them . <p> " Well , " she said with a smile that was n't really a smile , " I hope the sea was n't too rough to paint . " <p> His grandmother laughed . " It never holds still - but nothing worth painting ever does . " <p> The boy watched the thing coil again , and then , as if afraid of being seen , slip away into darkness . <p> When the boy was eight and his family lived outside the capital , their apartment was by a creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frogs , and guppies , putting them in mayonnaise jars with holes poked in the tops or plastic bowls or little wire cages his father made for him . Carrying them in his red wagon , which he pulled behind him down the sidewalks , he sold them to whoever would buy them . The families that had children bought them , while the apartments with only old people did not ; and this made sense . Amphibians , he knew , were not easy for an old person to take care of . <p> The creek he liked best was the one at home . It fed into a big swamp that had n't yet been drained for homes or stores . But there were other creeks , too - one by the bus stop , another at the cul-de-sac at the end of the street , and three or four in the woods by his school . All drained into that swamp . Before school and after , in the creeks and ponds around it , he would hunt for turtles and frogs , and sometimes he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Once his teacher made him go home to change , but this made him happy . It meant he could go through the woods again twice when everyone else was in school . This was the day he found , halfway home , a pond full of what his favorite book called " painted turtles , " and for a moment could only stare . The pond was n't large , but it was perfectly round , like one of the marvelous circles his grandmother sewed or painted , and on its bank the turtles made a circle , too , the red markings of their skin and shells flashing like fire in the sunlight . It was like a dream , and he wanted to tell his grandmother about it - he wanted her to see it because she would understand - but he could n't . She was at home cleaning , doing laundry , maybe starting to cook food for dinner . <p> The turtles stared back at him , and he knew that if God had a goldfish pond , these were the turtles He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery as the sun . These turtles he would not try to catch ; and as he stepped back to take another path , three of the turtles startled , slipping off their banks into the black water and wonderful rotting leaves while the others just kept watching him . <p> At a creek closer to home , where the woods began to thin , he filled his bucket ( the one he hid in a tree by the school each morning ) with young turtles . His book called them " sliders , " and because they were young , they were very green . A few minutes later he found the wide plank that went from one side of the creek to the other . This was the one creek he could n't cross by wading , and today there were two older boys and an older girl on the other side sitting and waiting when they should have been in school . He 'd never seen them before , but he could tell they were waiting for someone - anyone - to cross the plank . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , and was probably his sister . She was older and bigger and looked even tougher than the boys . Her eyes flashed , and there was something familiar about them . <p> " What do you have ? " the tallest boy asked , the one that had the girl 's eyes , standing up and nodding at his bucket . <p> He did n't want to answer , but he knew they 'd get mad if he did n't . " Some turtles . " <p> " If you want to cross the bridge , you got ta give them to us . " <p> " Why ? " he asked . <p> The boys laughed . " Because if you do n't we wo n't let you cross . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " What do you mean why ? " the girl said . Her eyes flashed again in the sunlight and even this far away he thought he saw something move in them . <p> He was shaking . He took a breath . " Why do you want my turtles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the turtles or we 'll come and get them , you little shit . " <p> The plank was too heavy for him to push into the water by himself , and he was n't a fast runner . He should n't make them mad , he knew , but he heard himself say : <p> " Is this what God would want you to do ? " <p> " What* " <p> " Would He ? " <p> " Jesus Christ , " the brother said . " Are you crazy ? " He was about to start across the plank when the girl stopped him . She was looking at the boy and his bucket of turtles - staring at him - as she said , " I 'll do it . " <p> There was a board in her hand now - one with a nail in it - one the boy had n't seen before - and she came toward him across the plank surefooted , her eyes never leaving him . She wanted him , he saw , and he recognized the eyes at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , not a woman 's , but that was the only difference . Did n't the boys see it ? Did n't they wonder where the board with the nail had come from - why the girl was acting this way ? <p> His grandmother was n't there - she could n't be - and yet suddenly , because the girl with the familiar eyes , the dark thing coiling in them , was coming for him , she was . She was back at the apartment cleaning and doing laundry while his mother taught school in the next town and his father worked in the capital , but she was somehow there . He could smell her , the flowery powder she wore , the vinegar she used on her hair . He could see her , too , in her flower-print dress , one of the ones she always wore . She was there , standing on the other side of the creek just behind the girl ; and the boys , who had n't noticed her before , did now and stopped and stared . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the taller , frowning , clenching his fists , and the girl turned on the plank and saw her , too . <p> " You 're not wanted here , " the girl hissed , eyes flashing , and with her free hand made a pattern in the air - one the boy had never seen before - and hissed again , " He 's mine . " <p> His grandmother smiled at the girl , but it was to him that she said , " John , do whatever you 'd like . " <p> " What , Grandma ? " <p> " Do whatever you want to do . " <p> He did . He pointed with his finger at the plank , where the girl was standing , and as he kept his finger aimed there , his grandmother helped him do it . Together , without touching it , they lifted the big board high into the air ; and as it rose , the girl fell off into the muddy water , shouting and hissing and dog-paddling so hard she could n't make patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , exactly where it had been before . <p> The two boys - even the girl 's brother - had backed away from his grandmother . They did n't want to be near a crazy old woman who made strange things happen . <p> " Stay where you are , " his grandmother said to them , and they did . <p> When the girl was out of the creek , muddy as a snapping turtle , it was as if the fire in her eyes had been put out . Her eyes were the eyes of any girl now . She could n't have hissed . She was the tall boy 's sister now , only that , and she looked half-asleep . " Craig , " she said to her brother . " What 's happening ... ? " <p> " Hold your sister 's hand , " his grandmother said to the brother , and the boy took it . " Keep holding it until you 're sure she 's your sister , and then you can all go home and watch television . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left them . The woods were bright . Nothing coiled or slithered in the shadows . They were just two boys now , like him , and the girl a girl , and his grandmother , with a rustle of leaves , was gone , back to the apartment , laundry and dinner . <p> You know what to do , John , was the last thing he heard his grandmother say . <p> He did . He crossed the plank because he needed to - he did n't want to get completely wet and muddy - and when he reached the other side , he gave the boys and the girl , who still looked asleep , his bucket of young sliders . They just stared at him - even though he smiled . <p> His grandmother would get him another bucket , he knew , and God always made other turtles . <p> That night , over dinner , his mother said , " And what did you do today , John ? " <p> Afraid to answer , he looked at his grandmother , who said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> His mother looked at his grandmother , then back at him , then at both of them again , and said , " And why would you do that , John ? " <p> The only thing he 'd told his grandmother was that the school had sent him home to change . She 'd given him dry pants and sent him back . He had n't mentioned the plank or boys or girl , how the girl had gotten muddy , or what had happened to the plank , but he did n't need to . She 'd been there . She knew , and it made him smile . <p> He said to his mother , " They did n't have any and I wanted to make them happy . " <p> " And did you ? " She did n't believe him , he could tell , but that was not the only thing that made her mad . <p> " Yes , Mom , " he said , " I did . " <p> She was staring at him - just at him - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered above them all , even his father , even his grandmother . <p> " I 'm glad to hear it , " his mother said at last , but it was a lie . <p> " Sometimes , " his grandmother said with a smile , " that 's what bullies really want - to get what they want without having to take it . It makes them happy . " <p> WHEN HE WAS eleven and his family lived in a big house in San Diego , on the great bay , and his mother taught school , as always , and his father left the house every morning to go to the Naval laboratory high on the peninsula ( where scientists built miniature ships made of brass and tested radar and sonar with them ) , he would go with his grandmother after school to Sorrento Valley , in the wild northern part of the county . There he would catch butterflies , katydids , witch moths , and other insects for his collection while she , with her watercolor class , painted the old eucalyptus trees they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anise , and lupine . It was here the boy first saw the tiny blue butterflies that would die if they left these hills ( these he would not try to catch ) ; and the great black wasps with orange wings - " tarantula killers " - that cruised like little helicopters a few feet from the earth , looking for the big spiders to paralyze and lay their eggs in , so their children would have something to eat . Both of these creatures filled him with wonder , and , like the painted turtles , made him think about God . <p> He had collected snakes when they 'd lived in PaIo Alto , the year before , but had felt bad about keeping them in terrariums and feeding them mice and lizards , which he also loved . So he 'd stopped collecting them . But one day in the Sorrento Valley , as his grandmother sat on the hillside with her painting class , the boy saw a king snake , his favorite kindthe one with the " yellow chain " pattern - slipping through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When its head came up to look at him , its tail coiling around his arm in fear , he saw what he 'd seen only once before and even then , not out in nature but in the museum downtown . <p> The snake , no more than two or three years old , had two heads . Both were alive , but one looked dumb , staring up at the sky as if in wonder , while the other hissed at him , ready to bite , with teeth so tiny it would only make him laugh . The two-headed king snake in the museum 's display case had been bigger , stuffed , and though its heads had been posed to look alive , the eyes had been dead . <p> He wanted to let it go , and yet he did n't want to . It was a beautiful thing , and he wanted to have it , to stare at its two heads for days until he understood what it was , how God could make a two-headed snake ( not often , but sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love so that a boy who was also a little strange might one day hold it , mesmerized by the miracle it was . <p> But he felt guilty about keeping it , and as he felt the old feeling , the snake relieved itself on his arm , as snakes sometimes do when afraid ; and as it did , he looked at its two heads and saw the ground opening at his feet , while the cobra - the one he knew from his dreams , but never when awake - rose from the earth , from the lupine and sage around him , and he could only stumble back with a cry , looking everywhere for his grandmother . <p> The cobra would n't stop , he knew . It never did in his dreams and it would n't now . It grew and grew until , thick as a tree , it towered over him . Where was his grandmother ? Where was her class ? Could n't they see it ? Its hood flared and he saw lettering on it , big old-fashioned letters that said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not read ; and when he looked into its eyes , which were the size of plates , he recognized them but could not remember whose they were . They were the cobra 's - that was what mattered - and he was , this time , going to die , just as he had in his dreams and as he would have twice awake had his grandmother not saved him . All it would take was for the jaws above him - the terrible jaws to spit , the venom dripping down his face , or the tip of a single fang , long as a curved kitchen knife , to touch him . <p> Then he heard a voice , one he knew , and when he looked to his right , there was his grandmother , her paint box and pad of watercolor paper under one arm , her other hand free to draw quick things in the air , while a swarm of the great black spider-killers and their orange wings spun in a whirlwind around her and little blue butterflies covered her hair lovingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , enraged , rose higher , hissed , and got ready to spit , - but the paint box was a book now , somehow , and the paper was wood , two pieces , crossed in a cross , and his grandmother said to him without moving her lips : <p> HoW it up to the sun , John . <p> The little two-headed snake was still wrapped in fear around his arm . He wanted to let it go , but instead did what she asked - raising it to the sun . <p> Seeing it , the cobra pulled back , hissed again , and rose higher wanting him . <p> The little snake in his hand became two , then three , then a dozen , all two-headed and glowing like little suns , - and when he finally let go of them they rose like butterflies , like wasps , filling the air ; and as they did the cobra stopped , stared , and could not look away . <p> His grandmother laughed . <p> That , John , she said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you . What it really wants is to forget itself , to forget its pain . It is happy now , watching the little snakes fill the sky , watching what it has always dreamed of being : Tiny and beautiful . <p> Back in the car , he tried to rub the smell off his arm , but his grandmother said , " Do n't worry about it . It 's the smell of fear , yes , but also love . " <p> That evening , just before his mother and father were to return from an awards ceremony at the laboratory , he sat in his grandmother 's bedroom , at the big table she had for all of her sea shells - the ones they 'd collected together in Florida and San Diego , and the ones her son , who had died years ago , had collected for her on Guam during the war . Together he and his grandmother had put the names of the seashells - the scientific names and the common ones - on little cards along with information about where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather had been like , because that 's how scientists did it . <p> As he held a Murex foliatus , beautiful with its petal-like folds - and the only one they 'd ever found in the great tide pools at the end of Point Loma - a shadow fell over the house and he knew what it was . As he and his grandmother listened , the front door opened and slammed , the house shook , something shrieked and what wanted him was there again . But this time he told himself what it really was . <p> His mother and father were back , and she was coming for him , hoping that his grandmother would be asleep by now , that he would be alone in his bedroom - awake or asleep , it did n't matter - and that what lived in her eyes would be free at last to do what it had wanted to do since he was born . <p> To have him - and if she could n't , to make sure no one else could . <p> His grandmother - blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not see - looked at him quickly and said , " Do what we 've done before , John . " <p> And they did , quickly . They put the largest shells - the big conchs , long trumpets , heavy " helmet shells , " and " ton shells " - in a big circle on the rug . Inside that circle they put another circle - of bright scallops , pectens , from all over the world , and angel wings , and fragile tellinas ( the prettiest of the clams ) ; and inside that circle another circle of the most beautiful cowries ( like living pearls ) , cone shells , and volutes ; and inside that , a circle of the sturdiest , bravest murexes ; and then a circle of the most fragile ones , the " Venus combs " and the black-spined nignspini until the floor was covered except for a circle just large enough for a boy in the middle of it . In that space his grandmother made a five-pointed star with olivas , slipper shells , keyhole limpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made him lie down on it quickly , though the spines of the spondyli hurt . <p> There was a knock on the door , and neither of them said a thing . He looked up at his grandmother and waited . " Do not look at the walls , " she whispered , but he could n't help himself . He wanted to know what the figure at the door was doing to the room this time . The walls had darkened , were darkening even more as the knock came again and louder . The walls were beginning to glisten . They were glistening with scales . They were covered with scales , and something-something like spit or venom or sea water - began to drip from the flowery wallpaper , from those scales , eating at the paper 's pattern of birds and flowers , making it curl to reveal beneath it the flesh of something huge - a great skinned frog , an immense turtle with its fiery-red shell crushed , something he 'd once loved . <p> The knocking grew more frantic as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door began to bleed , and as he and his grandmother watched it they heard what sounded like crying - which was impossible - a trick , a lie , since what was pounding wanted to kill him . <p> Do not move , his grandmother said . Be the star on the floor . <p> The door buckled in at the pounding and the voice on the other side , as it wept and screamed in rage and grief , said Are you all right ' 1 , and He 's not in his bedroom , but as always it was a trick . If he moved , she would take him and he would be nothing . <p> When the knocking stopped at last , the voice stopped too , and with it the crying . <p> " If you surround yourself with what you love , evil can not hurt you , " his grandmother said as they picked up her sea shells , put them back on the table , and she made the walls look right again . " It can only be jealous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother died , as he lay in his bed in the dark , he heard it coming for him on heavy footsteps . His grandmother 's room was too far away for him to hide in . Her shells were too far away and he was n't sure he could make the star correctly anyway . <p> When the figure entered his room , it did not turn on the light . <p> " John ? " <p> He could barely hear the word above the knocking of his heart . <p> " Yes , " he said . <p> " I wanted to tell you good-night . " It stepped toward him in the darkness . He could n't see its face . He wanted to look at it , yes - so that he might understand why it wanted to kill him - but he also did n't did n't want to see the face he had tried so long to love , but could not . <p> " I wanted to tell you good-night , " the figure said again . It had come to do what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother was dead , it could . Why was it waiting ? <p> " I also wanted to tell you - " <p> His heart stopped . The figure had sat down on the side of his bed , where pale light from the porch fell through the bedroom blinds to its broad face . He could see its eyes now . He could see its hands , perfectly still in its lap - hands that never made patterns in the air , that hated and always would the idea of such things . He looked in its eyes for the cobra , the towering wave , the girl with the board , the bleeding door , but he saw none of these things . <p> What he saw instead was impossible . <p> " - how sorry I am your grandmother is gone .... She was my mother , too ... and I miss her , John . " There were tears in the words . It had to be a trick , a lie , but it was n't . <p> The figure fell silent then , unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard his grandmother - who was gone , yes , but somehow there , as she would always be - say : <p> This is what she wanted all along , John - to have you for herself , that is all . And now that she does , what wanted to kill no longer needs to kill . It can sleep , and I will be watching . There are more witches , John , and spells than the world can imagine , and a witch who does n't know she is one is a sad and terrible thing . <p> Grandma ? he asked . <p> Do not be afraid . <p> I ca n't .... <p> Yes , you can . You now know who you are . <p> The boy waited , and when the figure sitting on the side of his bed still did not speak , he reached out , and , though he was shaking , touched it , saw his hand begin to glow like a little sun , and in a moment the figure touched him back , uncoiling in the warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
