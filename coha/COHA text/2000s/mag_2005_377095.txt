The renovation boom of the past few years is not a first for the U.S. In 1954 TIME celebrated an earlier DO-IT-YOURSELF generation . <P> In the postwar decade the do-it-yourself craze has become a national phenomenon . The once indispensable handyman who could fix a chair , hang a door or patch a concrete walk has been replaced by millions of amateur hobbyists who do all his work  --  and much more  --  in their spare time and find it wonderful fun . In the process they have turned do-it-yourself into the biggest of all U.S. hobbies and a booming $6 billion-a-year business ... The meaning of the tasks performed by white-collar employees and executives often becomes lost in the complexities of giant corporations ; it is hard for them to see what they are really accomplishing . But in his home workshop , anyone from president down to file clerk can take satisfaction from the fine table , chair or cabinet taking shape under his own hands  --  and bulge with pride again as he shows them off to friends .  --  TIME , Aug. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
