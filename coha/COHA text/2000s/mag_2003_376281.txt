For a city devoted to spectacle , Los Angeles does n't have many places where you can just sit around and take things in . The Walt Disney Concert Hall , Frank Gehry 's magnificent new building , is located across the street from a big multilevel parking lot . That 's a very Los Angeles place to be , of course , but not a great place to be seen from . Gehry 's other masterpiece , the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain , stretches out along the Nervion River , across from any number of cafes , where you can kick back and enjoy how it reclines along the water like Cleopatra on her barge . The Disney Hall , which opens this week in a glittery blast of galas and concerts , deserves nothing less . Its silvery cascades are one of the most beautiful sights anywhere in the U.S. If you have seen the Grand Canyon , another sun-drenched , curvy thing of hypnotic power , you have some idea of what the Disney Hall is like . <P> Splendor is not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . But for a long time , trouble was an appropriate word too . " We went through hell , " says Gehry , sitting amid the huge bustle of his office in a converted warehouse in Santa Monica . " But in the end , we made it work . " That 's putting it mildly on both counts . The Disney Hall may be one of the most anguished creative triumphs since the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel . But now that it 's here , it can be counted on to reverberate not just through L.A. but across the U.S. , raising the stakes everywhere for what a building can be . <P> It began in 1987 , when Lillian Disney , Walt 's widow , provided a surprise gift of $50 million to build a new home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic , which for years had been unhappily stashed in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , a slab of ' 60s-style bureaucratic neoclassicism with mediocre acoustics . The following year Gehry won the competition to design the new hall . At the time  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the man who made chain link and plywood into respectable building materials . Lillian , who was nearing 90 and whose taste ran to brick and thatched roofs , was utterly puzzled by the whiplashing scoops of Gehry 's design , which he had developed with the help of software used to design fighter planes . To convey what he had in mind , he once brought her a white rose floating in a bowl of water , an image that captured both her love of flowers and the sailing ships that are his favorite way of explaining the place he eventually built . The Disney Hall , he says , " is a boat where the wind is behind you . " <P> Winning over Mrs. D. was just one of his problems . The ' 90s were plague years in Los Angeles  --  riots , earthquake , recession  --  and a risky new classical-music hall looked like the last thing a threadbare city wanted . When it seemed as if the project would founder entirely , Richard Riordan , then mayor , brought in Eli Broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker , to head a $175 million fund-raising campaign to get the thing finished . ( In the end , it cost $274 million. )
