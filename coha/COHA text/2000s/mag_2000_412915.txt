The 25th-annual Toronto International Film Festival was a world beater : by Owen Gleiberman and Lisa Schwarzbaum Photograph GLOBAL WATTAGE ( 1 ) Unger and Skarsgard find Signs and Wonders ; ( 2 ) Sexy Beasts Kingsley and Winstone ; ( 3 ) Harris paints Pollock ; ( 4 ) Kusturica and the Widow Binoche E5 ) George Washington 's kids ( fi ) Branagh 's Dag daze ; f7 ) Be/'ore 's Johnny Depp ( with Bardem ) does drag // EACH YEAR , THE TORONTO International Film Festival has that big fat international planted right in the middle of its title , yet of the dozens of films that play there from Iran , France , India , Brazil , and many other countries , the sad but merciless truth is that only a fraction of them will enjoy so much as a brief theatrical run in the United States ; of those , a tinier sliver still will achieve any real visibility or impact . This year at Toronto , however , I saw one film , steeped in the mist and memories of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impact . The fact that the movie is in English , and that it was directed by the American painter-turned-filmmaker Julian Schnabel ( Basquiat ) , in no way compromises the supple and shattering truth of its vision . Before Night Falls is a full-scale portrait , at once epic , intimate , and transporting , of life within the lush fortress of Fidel Castro 's Cuba . Schnabel , who has become a far more compelling director than he ever was a painter , based the film on the memoirs of the late gay Havana poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas . He has structured Before Night Falls with a glancing episodic grace , laying out the unruly canvas of Arenas ' life-his friendships and erotic entanglements , his quiet , unwitting war with a government whose ideology of repression is rooted in an ambiguous psychosexual dance with LatinCatholic machismo . A year after Elian Gonzalez and Buena Vista Social Club , Schnabel takes us deeper inside Cuba-its dreams and its perils , its grand yet crumbling infrastructure , its tyranny and tenderness and divided soul-than any previous film has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his now playful , now haunted presence , seems to etch the spiritual contours of a lifetime before your eyes . Until Before Night Falls , I 'd never actually heard of Arenas . By contrast , I was avid to see Pollock , Ed Harris ' biopic of Jackson Pollock , the visionary dynamo of drip-painting . The genius-at- work-in-his-studio scenes are everything you want : Because of the improvisatory nature of Pollock 's techniques , we believe , in a way that we almost never do in famous-artist films , that we 're seeing the actual creation of legendary works . But Harris , terrific as he is at playing Pollock in an aesthetic trance or an alcoholic rage , never figures out how the guy got that way . The movie is fascinating around the edges with a big hole at its center . As a filmmaker , David Mamet is like a wine that grows tastier each year . His delectably witty State and Main is one of those irresistible movies about moviemaking-it 's Day for Night for the infotainment age . William H. Macy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows up , along with a rat pack of crew members and a pair of infantile stars ( Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker ) , to shoot a movie in the contempoCapra town of Waterford , Vt . The terrific one-liners just keep coming , and so do Mamet 's acrid insights into the art of lying , 21st-century-Hollywood style . I only wish that Tom Tykwer , the dazzling creator of Run Loch Run , showed similar growth . His latest , The Princess and the Warrior , is about a psychiatric nurse rescued from an auto accident by a criminal who then wants nothing to do with her , but the film is as elephantine and empty as Lola was fast and lightly profound . Atom Egoyan , on the other hand , takes a sly sidelong route with Krapp 's last Tape , an hour-long film of Samuel Beckett 's 1958 play , starring John Hurt , in a superb performance , as the curmudgeon who looks over his life with sputtering regret and contempt . After all of that Art , I needed a fix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Reservoir Dogs-style talkathon thriller , this volatile British gadget of a movie stars Ray Winstone as an ex-mobster living in sunny Spain who tries to avoid getting pulled back into the action by his old boss , a Cockney hard case played with flamboyant psychotic minimalism by Ben Kingsley . The man who was Gandhi does a mean ultra-thug . Turn up your overhype alert : George Washington , a moody and pretentious no-budget indie out of North Carolina , is about to be anointed by many film critics as the second coming of .. I do n't know what . An awkward cross between Gummo and River 's Edge , it 's a movie in which the young stars improvise bravely within a design so lackadaisical that the film all but dissolves in front of you . Beyond that , Kenneth Branagh has his best nonShakespeare role ever in Now to Kill Your Neighbor 's Dog , the tale of an acidly clever British playwright going through a new kind of midlife crisis .

It strains the metaphor only slightly to suggest that the movies I loved best at this year 's festival were the ones that confounded expectations and defied conformity , especially conformity to conventions of genre or national styles .

And in that stillness , Gillian Anderson sheds X-Files armor , blossoming in a performance of aching vulnerability as the proud , foolish , discarded Bart . The conventions of historical biopics get blown to smithereens in Pandaemonlum , a hell-or-highwater swoon ( from the Ken Russell school of mad romanticism ) that treats a pair of famous 19th-century English poets like the outrageous rock stars of their time they so surely were . ( Director Julien Temple kept his finger on the Sex Pistols in The Filth and the Fury . ) John Hannah plays William Wordsworth ; Linus Roache embodies opium-addicted Samuel Taylor Coleridge . As Mike Leigh did with TopsyTurvy , but with an utterly dif ferent , near-delirious visual vocabulary , Temple captures the feeling of creative electricity , throwing his own into a film as trippy as Coleridge 's Xanadu . Photograph TORONTO RAPTURES ( 1 ) Franka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moss have a Memento // Cubist narration is no novelty in filmmaking , but Christopher Nolan shuffles time like a pro croupier in Memento , a clever noir caper that 's not only a whodunit but also a whattimeisit . Guy Pearce 's Bakelite-hard features make him the perfect antihero , Leonard , whose determination to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife is confounded by his loss of all short-term memory : To keep track of the very recent past , he needs index cards , Polaroids , and even tattoos . As with The Usual Suspects , Memento is all about structural loops , not emotional arcs , but Nolan builds a cool house of cards . For that matter , Dogma-style restrictions and technical specs are no novelties either , not anymore . But the Danish artistic movement has liberated two very different filmmakers . For Joel Schumacher-yes , that Liberace-like keeper of the Batcave-Tigerland may be his best , most affecting work since Falling Dawn .

Jonathan Nossiter , who made the mournful and adult 1997 festival favorite Sunday , uses the lightness of digital video to probe new adult relationships from vertiginous new angles in Signs and Wonder , an erudite and rewarding drama starring Charlotte Rampling and Stellar Skarsgard . A nonfiction film about Tobias Schneebaum , a gay , Jewish , septuagenarian New Yorker who was once , by the way , a cannibal in Peru , is guaranteed to lead viewers off the beaten path . In Keep the River on Your Right : A Modern Cannibal Tale , siblings David Shapiro and Laurie Gwen Shapiro frame Schneebaum ( on whose 1969 memoir the story is pegged ) as a lively and sensitive man in full , not just a cocktail-circuit oddity The Young Unknowns , meanwhile , a small , quietly shocking fiction by featore first-timer Catherine Jelski , takes one of the droopiest of indie cliches-the miseries of spoiled rich kids adrift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicting . ( Devon Gummersall from My So-Called Life stars in an astonishing performance . ) I loved the austere beauty and compassion of The Widow of St Pierre , Patrice Leconte 's historical drama starring Juliette Binoche and the nonstop-magnificent Daniel Auteuil-with Yugoslavian director Emir Kusturica playing a murderer , no less . But love-or , for that matter , visual beauty-has nothing to do with the furious power of Baise-moi . This graphic , hardcore , blood-soaked jag ( X-rated even in France ) about a couple of screwed-over women who turn tables , screwing and killing men , may be the most direct , ungussied expression of female sexual rage ever thrown up on screen . And I mean thrown up . A lot of people hated it . Fortunately , Nine West was just down the street , offering those people some much safer merchandise . - LS // CRITICAL MASS // <p>
