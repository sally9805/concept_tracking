Chapter One Get Over It , a Lot of People Are Dead " You bitch , you killed me ! You suck ! " Tommy had just awakened for the first time as a vampire . He was nineteen , thin , and had spent his entire life between states of amazement and confusion . " I wanted us to be together . " Jody : pale , pretty , long red hair hanging in her face , cute swoop of a nose in search of a lost spray of freckles , a big lipstick-smeared grin . She 'd only been undead herself for a couple of months , and was still learning to be spooky . " Yeah , that 's why you spent the night with him . " Tommy pointed across the loft to the life-sized bronze statue of a man in a tattered suit . Inside the bronze shell was the ancient vampire who had turned Jody . Another bronze of Jody stood next to him . When the two of them had gone out at sunrise , into the sleep of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground floor of his building and had the vampires bronzed . He 'd thought it would give him time to think of what to do , and keep Jody from running off with the old vampire . Tommy 's mistake had been drilling ear holes in Jody 's sculpture so she could hear him . Somehow , during the night , before the bronzing , the old vampire had taught her to turn to mist , and she 'd streamed out of the ear holes into the room , and-well-here they were : dead , in love , and angry . " I needed toknow about what I am , Tommy . Who else was going to tell me if not him ? " " Yeah , but you should have asked me before you did this , " Tommy said . " You should n't just kill a guy without asking . It 's inconsiderate . " Tommy was from Indiana , and his mother had raised him to have good manners and to be considerate of other people 's feelings . " You had sex with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not the same , " Tommy said . " I was just being friendly , like when you put a quarter in someone else 's parking meter when they are n't there-you know they appreciate it later , even if they do n't thank you personally . " " Yeah , wait until you go out in your jammies and wake up all sticky in a cheerleader outfit and see how grateful you are . You know , Tommy , when I 'm out , technically , I 'm dead . Guess what that makes you ? " " Well-uh-yeah , but you 're not even human . You 're just some foul dead thing . " Tommy immediately regretted saying it . It was hurtful and mean , and although Jody was , indeed , dead , he did n't find her foul at all-in fact , he was pretty sure he was in love with her , he was just a little embarrassed about the whole necrophilia/cheerleader thing . Back in the Midwest people did n't mention that sort of thing unless a dog dug up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the whole human pyramid buried under the swing set . Jody sniffled , completely for effect . Actually she was relieved that Tommy was now on the defensive . " Well , welcome to the Foul , Dead Thing Club , Mr. Flood . " " Yeah , you drank my blood , " Tommy said . " A lot . " Damn , she should have pretended to cry . " You let me . " " Again , being considerate , " Tommy said . He stood up and shrugged . " You just let me because of the sex . " " That 's not true , it was because you needed me . " He was lying , it was because of the sex . " Yes , I did , " Jody said . " I still do . " She held her arms out to him . " I really do . " He walked into her arms and held her . She felt amazing to him , even more amazing than she had before . It was as if his nerves had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the sex . " Great , she thought , in control once again . She kissed his neck . " How do you feel about it now ? " " Maybe in a minute , I 'm starving . " He let go of her and stormed across the loft to the kitchen , where he pulled a burrito out of the freezer , threw it into the microwave , and hit the button , all in one smooth motion . " You do n't want to eat that , " Jody said . " Nonsense , it smells great . It 's like every little bean and pork piece is sending out its own delicious miasma of flavor vapor . " Tommy used words like " miasma " because he wanted to be a writer . That 's why he 'd come to San Francisco in the first place-to take life in big bites and write about it . Oh , and to find a girlfriend . " Put the burrito down , and back away , Tommy , " Jody said . " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cute . " He took a big bite and grinned at her as he chewed . Five minutes later , because she felt responsible , Jody was helping him clean bits of masticated burrito off the kitchen wall and the front of the refrigerator . " It 's like every bean was storming the gates of repressive digestion to escape . " " Yeah , well , being refried will do that to you , " Jody said , stroking his hair . " You okay ? " " I 'm starving . I need to eat . " " Not so much eat , " Jody said . " Oh my God ! It 's the hunger . I feel like my insides are caving in on themselves . You should have told me about this . " She knew how he felt-actually , she had felt worse when it happened to her . At least he knew what was happening to him . " Yeah , sweetie , we 're going to have to make a few adjustments . " " Well , what do I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of you , remember ? " " You should have thought this through before you killed me . I 'm fucked . " " We 're fucked . Together . Like Romeo and Juliet , only we get to be in a sequel . Very literary , Tommy . " " Oh , that 's a comfort . I ca n't believe you just killed me like that . " " And turned you into a superbeing , thank you very much . " " Oh , crap , there 's burrito spooge all over my new sneakers. " (
