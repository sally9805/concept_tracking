Chapter One 1882 There was never enough time . Alanna Patterson stood before the small open portal of the captain 's cabin . The night wind was warm and the dark sky aglow with an endless blanket of stars . The gentle waters of James River lapped against the side of the schooner Intrepid . She closed her eyes and drew in a deep breath . Mossy scents of the docks mingled with the aroma of tobacco bundles and freshly milled lumber . The ship had been loaded this afternoon and was ready for departure tomorrow . If only this night could last forever . Strong arms banded around Alanna and wrapped her in warmth . Her hand came up to his powerful arms . " Caleb . " He nuzzled his cheek next to hers . Thick stubble teased her soft skin . " Come back to bed . " She tipped her head back against his bare chest . " It 's getting late . I must leave soon so that I can be home before anyone realizes I am gone . " Caleb inhaled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " Heat spread through her body as she remembered their lovemaking . " Nor I. " " I love our nights together but I hate it when you leave . " " Soon we will be wed and I wo n't have to sneak back home at dawn . " His arms tightened around her . " Stay with me . Come with me on this next voyage . " The idea tempted but reason overcame it quickly . " I ca n't leave Richmond now . And you will be back in six weeks . It 's not such a long time . " " Six weeks is a lifetime . " He laid his large hands on her shoulders and turned her to face him . She stared up into his warm blue eyes so filled with love and tenderness . " Marry me . " She flattened her hands against his bare muscular chest . His heart beat wildly under her fingertips . " We are getting married after you return , " she said . He captured a strand of her silken blond hair between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more months . I want to marry you now . " She smiled . " It 's the middle of the night . " " There 's a church not four blocks from here . I 'll wake the minister . " The idea made her giddy . She traced the cleft in his chin with her fingertip . " We ca n't wake the minister , Caleb . It would n't be right . " His gaze darkened . " Why not ? I 'll make a large donation to the church to make it worth his while . " She sensed an edge of desperation in him that she 'd never felt before . " My father wants to give us a grand wedding as a peace gesture . It 's his way of giving us his blessing . And my mother would have wanted the best for me if she were alive . I do n't want to disappoint him . " " We 'll marry again before everyone if that 's what you want , but tonight I want to marry you . " She took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms . " Why the sudden change ? " He shoved out a sigh . " Call it a bad feeling . " She traced his firm jaw with her fingertip . Seamen put a good deal of stock in omens and gut feelings . Even Caleb , as logical as he could be , was n't immune to superstition . " There 's nothing to worry about . Father has given his blessing . There 's nothing to keep us apart anymore . " " I want the world to know you are mine . I love you more than anything . If I were to lose you , I 'd go mad . " She squeezed his hand . He wielded great strength in his body , yet he allowed her to see the vulnerability in his heart . " I do n't need a minister 's vows to seal my love for you . I will be waiting for you when you sail back into the harbor six weeks from now . I am yours . I will love and honor you , Caleb Pitt . Forever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped his gaze to their hands clasped together . He kissed her fingers . " Say it again . " " I will love you forever and always , Caleb . I am yours to the end of time . " " And I love you , Alanna . For richer or for poorer , in sickness and in health . Until death us do part . " Tears filled her eyes as she stared up into the face of the man she loved . " Nothing will ever tear us apart . " ( Continues ... )
