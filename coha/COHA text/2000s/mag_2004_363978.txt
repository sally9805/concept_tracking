Every political period has its characteristic form of scandal . During the Reagan defense buildup of the mid-1980s , the scandal of the day was " waste , fraud and mismanagement " at the Pentagon , symbolized by the infamous $640 toilet seat . Amid the general embarrassment and excusemaking , only one defense hawk was bold enough to declare that waste and fraud were actually good things . " We need more " of them , wrote Edward Luttwak in Commentary . If you 're going to build a stronger defense and build it fast , a bit of corruption is a necessary by-product . <P> Today 's characteristic form of scandal is financial abuse and excess . So where is the Luttwak of today who will cut through all the demagoguery and the whining , the outraged criticism and the mealymouthed apologies , and say , Look , you want a vigorous entrepreneurial economy ? A bit of excess is a necessary by-product . " We need more " financial abuse  --  it is a sign that capitalism is working . <P> Who has the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if I were that man , the case would run something like this : the magic of capitalism , as explained by Adam Smith and his followers , is that it channels individual greed into activities that benefit all of us . " Greed is good , " declared Michael Douglas , playing a corrupt financier in the movie Wall Street . More accurately , greed is inevitable . It is part of the human condition . And in moderation , economists argue and history demonstrates , greed is no bad thing . Free-market economies could not function if we were all Mother Teresa . <P> But there is nothing inherent in the human condition that keeps greed in moderation . So there are laws , and there are appearances . Both these forces draw a rough line  --  and attempt to police it  --  between greed that helps other people and greed that hurts other people . Inevitably , though , some will take greed too far . And that 's a good thing ( goes the argument I lack the courage to make ) . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keynes used the term animal spirits to describe the motivation of business people . A successful economy needs a culture that encourages them , up to a point . It 's a Goldilocks-type situation . You do n't want too much greed , and you do n't want too little  --  you want an amount that 's just right . But the dials are not all that sensitive . A culture that encourages enough greed in enough people will encourage too much in a few . If nobody is taking greed too far , you can be certain that too few people are taking it far enough . <P> For some reason , none of the lawyers who are defending the big greedheads have chosen to make this argument . Instead , they offer inconsistent theories to explain the obvious . Lawyers for the Rigas family , which performed the remarkable feat of bankrupting a cable company , say their clients ca n't be guilty of a conspiracy to loot the company because they are too dimwitted : one is " not the savviest guy , " another is " clueless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in part that she is too clever to have done anything as dumb as conspiring to break the securities laws .
