THE EARLIEST KNOWN REFERENCES TO AURORAS DATE BACK TO the Old Testament , and in the 2,500 years since then the northern lights have fascinated casual skywatchers and scientists alike . But probably fewer than 5 percent of the Earth 's inhabitants during this period have ever seen an aurora , since auroras usually appear only at high northern and southern latitudes , far from the world 's population centers . However , dedicated skywatchers who keep their eyes open have a much better chance than the public at large . And the odds of sighting an aurora on any given night are about at their best right now and will remain so through the next couple of years . Auroras make their way down to temperate latitudes during magnetic storms ( temporary disturbances in the Earth 's magnetic field ) that originate from activity on the Sun . We are now near the peak of the Sun 's 11-year activity cycle , so frequent magnetic storms are anticipated for 2000 and 2001 . When and Where to Look Until recently there was no way to predict an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the stars and wait to get lucky . Today , however , you can do better . Photograph Finnish photographer Pekka Parviainen is known worldwide for his photographs of atmospheric and astronomical phenomena . This all-sky view shows the converging streamers that typify an auroral corona. // The aurora is a more or less permanent feature of Earth 's high latitudes . It is usually confined to two large , thin ovals encircling the Earth 's north and south magnetic poles . Nighttime satellite pictures routinely show these so-called auroral ovals as halos of light crowning the top and bottom of the globe ( an example appears at lower right ) . One can talk about the auroral oval in two ways . The " statistical oval " is its average location at a given level of magnetic activity ; the " instantaneous oval " is the aurora 's actual location at a particular moment . The statistical oval can be used to estimate the likelihood of seeing auroras from a particular site . On any given night , the instantaneous oval often falls elsewhere . To complicate matters further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spectacular activity called a substorm . Substorms usually occur around local midnight . They cause the instantaneous oval to rapidly expand poleward . The auroral ovals are two halos of light ( the aurora borealis and the aurora australis ) about 110 kilometers above the Earth and centered on the magnetic poles . The Earth rotates under these halos about its geographic axis . This means that at far northern latitudes , near the oval 's ordinary " home " location , some simple rules of thumb apply . In central Alaska or northern Scandinavia , on most nights you can expect to rotate directly under the oval in the midevening hours , be inside it ( poleward of it ) around midnight , and pass under it again before dawn . Thus one expects to see the aurora move from the northern sky shortly after dark , to overhead at midevening , and to the south around midnight , then back overhead again in the early hours of the morning . At the lower latitudes where most of us live , however , we are usually so far equatorward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . When we can , we almost always have to look near the north horizon ( for observers in the Northern Hemisphere ) . Because the oval extends farthest toward the equator around the middle of the night , that is the best time for would-be aurora watchers at temperate latitudes to look . During magnetic storms the auroral oval expands to lower latitudes and we can see a display earlier in the evening and higher in the sky or even overhead . During a rare large storm , the oval may expand so far toward the equator that it can be seen from the tropics , while skywatchers at midnorthern latitudes actually find themselves facing south .

The tip-off is a solar flare near the center of the Sun 's disk or a coronal mass ejection aimed toward Earth . A worldwide array of observatories constantly monitors the Sun for such events . The Sun always gives off a solar wind , composed mostly of electrons and protons , which interacts with the Earth 's magnetic field to light the auroral oval ( see the companion article on page 34 ) . A solar eruption can make the solar wind come thicker and faster , with gusts that buffet the Earth 's magnetosphere and power up the auroral oval accordingly . These wind enhancements take one or two days to reach us , allowing time to plan . Sources of predictions are described in the sidebar below . Shapes and Forms The variety of shapes , colors , and movements of auroras are infinite . Like snowflakes , no two are alike . Faced with such a bewildering variety , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auroras into types and subtypes . These often unwieldy classifications may be found in the International Auroral Atlas ( 1963 ) . For example , " a3p2mR2B3e " would describe a bright red and green multiple-rayed band , with medium-length rays showing horizontal movement and flaming activity ! In 25 years of auroral research , I do not recall ever having seen such classifications used in any productive scientific way . Indeed , the days of useful amateur visual auroral observations are probably past . Auroral research is much more sophisticated now and relies on low-light-level imaging or interferometric systems ( often deployed in arrays covering a range of latitudes ) , together with simultaneous observations carried out by ground-based magnetometers and radars as well as instruments on satellites . // How to Get Aurora Predictions // Nevertheless , a simplified vocabulary of auroral types is good to have . Here are what I consider useful descriptive terms for auroral forms , structures , motions , and brightnesses . Forms . Auroras come in five fundamental shapes . 1 . Arcs are simple , slightly curved bands of light with smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower edges characterized by kinks or folds . 3 . Patches are small , isolated regions of glow . 4 . Veils are extensive , uniform glows covering an appreciable fraction of the sky . 5 . Rays are shafts of light . They follow the Earth 's magnetic field lines and tend to extend vertically . Structure . The five forms above show one of three types of internal structure . 1 . Homogeneous , or smooth . 2 . Striated , made of irregular fine lines or filaments . 3 . Rayed , made of definite rays larger than filaments . Two especially striking combinations occur frequently and deserve special mention . A curtain ( or drapery ) is a rayed band looped in dramatic folds . A corona is a group of rays that appears to converge on a point high in the sky . This is a perspective effect caused when we look directly up along a bundle of parallel magnetic field lines . Temporal Behavior . An aurora may be motionless , or it may change or move , 1 . Quiet means steady for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Pulsating denotes brightness increasing and decreasing more or less periodically . 3 . Flickering refers to fast pulsating ( say 5 or 10 times per second , up to a speed the human eye can no longer resolve ) . Photograph A matter of perspective . Akira Fujii 's photograph of an auroral curtain ( left ) owes its appearance in part to his proximity to the field lines involved . The " railroad-track " illusion ( wherein parallel lines appear to converge ) plays a key role in the corona ( right ) . This auroral morphology manifests itself when the observer is directly below a bundle of plasma-channeling magnetic-field lines . Photograph by Pekka Parviainen . Photograph Photographing the Aurora // 4 . Flaming describes bursts of luminosity appearing at the base of a form and rushing upward . Brightness . Auroras have a wide range of brightness , usually rated from 0 to 4 on a logarithmic scale ( the International Brightness Coefficient , or IBC ) in which each number is 10 times brighter than the previous one . Zero means subvisual , detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way ; whitish with no discernible color . Two is comparable to moonlit cirrus clouds ; color is barely identifiable ( usually yellow-green ) . Three is like brightly lit cirrus or moonlit cumulus clouds ; colors are evident . Four is much brighter than three ; may cast discernible shadows ; good colors , many of them fleeting . If you can see any color , the aurora is at least IBC 2 . When it 's hard to see bright stars through an aurora , it 's IBC 3 or brighter . These terms will help you recognize , describe , and understand what you see . As we are reaching the maximum of the current sunspot cycle , this year or the next should offer the best opportunities to see fine displays of the northern ( and southern ) lights for some time to come . The Web sites listed on page 45 offer far better predictive possibilities than have ever before been available . So make the most of the opportunity , and good luck ! Auroral Cinematography Because of the lengthy exposures required , auroras can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time-lapse exposures are required , with the exposure time per frame suggested in the tables on page 46 . The range of available films for movie cameras is much more limited than for still cameras , but Kodak has recently introduced an ISO 800 negative film that I have used to excellent effect in auroral time-lapse cinematography . As part of Solar Max , an Imax(R)-format film currently in production , I recorded the aurora in Greenland on 65-mm movie film with a special f/1.0 fisheye lens and exposures of 1 second per frame . The sample frames ( of an IBC 2+ aurora ) shown below suggest what can be achieved and indicate that even shorter exposures would be possible . For projection , the original frames are typically step-printed - each original frame is repeated 2 or 3 times , thus reducing the speeded-up effect of the timelapse shooting . Even the brightest aurora can not be captured on amateur or even professional television cameras . Scientific cameras that allow time exposures for each frame can give results similar to those of time-lapse film cameras , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras are required for real-time recording , but the intensifier results in a very noisy image and loses all color information . Extremely expensive experimental cameras using three image intensifiers have been used to make color videos of auroras . Some results from such cameras may be seen on the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute Web site .
