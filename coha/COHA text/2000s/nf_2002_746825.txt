Section : FINDINGS Large barbs on her hind legs turn a female cicada killer into a soil-moving machine . <p> Its translucent orange wings buzzing , a giant wasp dragged a large green cicada along the ground toward a redbud tree . The hymenopteran 's size , markings , and behavior easily identified it as a cicada killer . Only moments before , my wife had called my attention to this drama unfolding alongside our house in Indianapolis , and I had grabbed my video camera and rushed out to record it . As I filmed , the wasp clutched the cicada 's belly against its own , using its middle pair of legs , and tried to climb up the side of the tree with its two free pairs . After several failed attempts at dragging its large quarry up the trunk , the cicada killer eventually dropped the prey and flew away . <p> As a newcomer to the Midwest in the early 1990s , I soon became fascinated with these giant wasps , and over the past ten years I 've investigated many aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States east of the Rocky Mountains . At a length of one and a half inches and a weight of one gram , females are twice as large as males , ranking among the largest of the North American wasps . By comparison , the familiar honeybee weighs just under a tenth of a gram . Despite its name , only the female cicada killer actually hunts cicadas . After locating one , she paralyzes it with her sting and transports it to her elaborate underground burrow , where she lays an egg on it . Within a few days , the egg hatches into a grub that devours the paralyzed prey alive . Only wasp grubs feed on cicadas ; as adults , both sexes turn instead to carbohydrate fuel , such as the sap of sunflower plants . <p> While cicada killers are large insects , so , too , are their only prey : the annual , or dog-day , cicadas , thus named because they emerge during the hottest days of summer . In fact , a cicada can weigh up to three times as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off with such oversize prey in tow , but most sidestep the problem by dragging the cicada along the ground and up a tree , then launching themselves into the air and flying downward toward their burrow . In the absence of suitable trees , cicada killers have been known to let a willing human observer stand in as a launch pad , climbing to the top of his head to gain altitude . Others , like the one I witnessed struggling in my yard , are so overloaded that they have difficulty even climbing . <p> Not all people familiar with cicada killers are fans of these insects , especially once they 've seen the dramatic pockmarking of their lawns caused by the females ' prodigious digging . Each burrow is extensive , and discarded soil accumulates in a considerable pile outside the entrance ; my students and I found that an individual female often moves more than two pounds of soil when digging a burrow  --  a thousand times her own weight in dirt . And at an inch wide , her burrow 's entrance hole appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The males do not dig but can be quite intimidating . The first sex to emerge as adults , they congregate to patrol territories where new females will surface . Indeed , the presence of the huge insects , combined with the disruption of property , can be so distressing that one Indiana woman chose to move rather than tolerate the annual invasion of her yard , and an Illinois town closed its public park in 1996 due to a large wasp infestation . <p> Discounting the difference in size , male and female cicada killers closely resemble each other . Both sexes have a pair of " spurs " on each hind leg where the tibia , or fourth leg segment , joins the tarsus , or foot . But the females ' spurs are much larger relative to their body size than are those of the males . <p> I wondered what function the extra-large spurs might serve , assuming that it must be related to some behavior unique to females . In 1966 , Howard Ensign Evans , an American authority on wasp behavior , noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by P.G . Howes , and speculated that they were used to support prey during flight . Howes had removed the spurs from the legs of a female cicada killer and reported that the next cicada she carried was held in a more vertical position . He concluded from this simple experiment that the spurs functioned in carrying prey . I wondered , however , if this conclusion could have been the chance result of conducting just one experiment on a single wasp . In fact , I have often seen wasps with spurs intact carrying cicadas vertically . <p> Furthermore , it did n't make sense to me that females would need such an adaptation to carry cicadas , since wasps have perfectly good pretarsi ( pairs of tiny hooks on the ends of their feet ) with which to hold objects . I suspected instead that the spurs might be useful for digging . When excavating their burrows , female cicada killers loosen the soil by biting at the compact earth with their mandibles . They then use their forelegs to throw the loosened particles back and under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt out of the hole . Since wasps have long , thin legs , I conjectured that the spurs might help move soil by providing the hind legs with more surface area  --  akin to using a snow shovel instead of a garden spade . <p> At my former institution , Western Illinois University , undergraduate student Kimberly Wiedman Yee and I began to investigate this hypothesis . Examining the insect 's legs under a microscope , we found that there were no muscles or tendons attached to the spurs , so we knew that the wasp could n't be moving them voluntarily . Instead , the spurs are passively movable . They attach to a small region of soft , leathery cuticle that is quite unlike the rigid armor covering most of the insect 's body ; bending the joint between the tibia and tarsus pulls on this flexible skin , which in turn pulls on the base of the spur , extending it out and away from the leg . <p> When we manipulated the hind legs by hand , the spurs extended until increased resistance stopped them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , we could flex the spurs without difficulty until they folded flat against the leg . Using a device that measures force , we determined that the spurs exerted a good deal of force when extended , but virtually none at all when flexed down toward the leg . <p> To understand how female wasps make use of their leg spurs , we videotaped the insects digging their burrows in the wild . Reviewing the tapes in slow motion , we saw that while pushing soil , the hind leg is thrust in an arc back and outward . At the beginning of this motion , the joint between tibia and tarsus is bent , extending the spurs to a position where they would exert a significant force when pushed against the soil . That is , the spurs are actually useful in moving dirt . When a wasp carries a cicada , by contrast , its hind legs remain straight , with the spurs collapsed against the leg . The obvious conclusion is that the spurs are well suited to the needs of digging but are useless in prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their hind legs that they use for grooming . These grooming spurs probably evolved initially from the ordinary spines present on the cuticle of most insects . Among female cicada killers , these spurs may have taken on a secondary function in digging . Natural selection would have favored larger spurs , because the increased surface area allows more soil to be moved during each stroke of the wasp 's hind leg . <p> This improved digging efficiency could allow a female cicada killer to excavate more extensive burrows or to complete a burrow faster . Both factors bear significantly on reproductive success . In addition to constructing the main burrow tunnel , a female must dig separate branching chambers to hold each of her sixteen or so eggs , along with the immobilized prey  --  and her average life span of two weeks means she has little time to waste . From the mass of a typical dirt pile and the digging rate of an average female , Yee and I calculated that a wasp can complete a burrow in one night , a notion consistent with field observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nocturnal digging gives the wasps more daylight hours for hunting cicadas : one for each male larva and two for each female , providing the future huntresses with enough nourishment to grow to their greater size . <p> Interestingly , the great golden digger wasp , a close relative of the cicada killer , does not have enlarged spurs and digs only with its forelegs . According to Evans , digging with the hind legs is unusual among the many wasp species that burrow . Digging insects that follow a dedicated underground lifestyle ( such as mole crickets and cicada nymphs ) typically have six spiny , rather stout legs that make effective shovels . Hence , they need no spurs . Although the cicada killer 's digging tools do n't follow this common pattern , they do get the job done . The wasp 's hind tibial spurs are a classic example of the way evolution often operates : tinkering with existing structures and co-opting them for new uses . The cicada killer 's spurs may be imperfectly adapted to the needs of digging , but cicada killers are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ideal evolutionary compromise between the demands of digging and the requirements for flying . <p> A female cicada killer struggles to drag her oversize prey to her burrow . <p> In summer , the burrow holes of wasps freckle lawns across the eastern United States . <p> A cutaway view of a burrow reveals individual chambers that house one or two paralyzed cicadas for each wasp grub . <p> S ( COLOR ) : An expert digger , a female cicada killer clears a runway , above .
