The Haunting By Joan Lowery Nixon Random House Joan Lowery Nixon My fingers shook as I pushed back the long strands of hair that had fallen over my face . I peered at the pale , shriveled ninety-six-year-old woman who lay in a coma in the hospital bed . The sound-was it a whisper ? - came again . This time I could see the colorless lips move . Holding my breath , I edged forward in the wobbly plastic chair . I was ready to jump to my feet and run . I had better find Mom and Grandma . Great-grandmother Sarah was waking up . I stretched out a hand to the edge of her bed , steadying myself . Slowly and quietly I began to rise . Suddenly Sarah 's deep brown eyes opened and she stared at me . Her knobby fingers clamped around my wrist so tightly that it hurt . " Do n't go , Anne . " It sounded like an order . In a voice as raspy as a fingernail on a blackboard , she managed to utter , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath , my pounding heart banging loudly in my ears . " I-I 'm not my mom-that is , Anne , " I stammered . " It's-Lia . Anne 's daughter . Mom 's down in the hospital cafeteria with Grandma . They asked me to sit with you . Mom and I came to San Francisco because you 've been in a coma , and . . . I knew I was babbling and it felt as if , as usual , I was doing everything all wrong . I begged , " If you 'll let go of me I 'll run and get Mom . Grandma , too , " But Sarah did n't seem to hear . Her gaze did n't waver as she stared into my eyes . " Be quiet , Anne , " she insisted , " Listen to me . I realized that Great-grandmother hardly knew me , so I did n't blame her for not recognizing me . But I did n't look like Mom , I did n't look like Grandma , I did n't look the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long line of strong women from whom I had descended , Tall , big-boned , and handsome , with dark hair and brown eyes , my maternal ancestors had stepped into the world with pride and courage and had accomplished amazing things . Then there was me . I could n't count how often I 'd heard Grandma Augusta say , " Speak up , Lia , so people can hear you . And for goodness ' sakes get that hair out of your eyes . It looks like you 're hiding behind a curtain . " Sometimes Grandma would sigh dramatically , sadly shake her head , and say to my mother , " Look at the child , Anne . She 's no bigger than a minute and all that pale hair-where did it come from ? She 's not a bit like any of the women in our family . If I had n't been on hand at the hospital when she was born , I might start believing in changelings . " My mom was n't as blunt , but sometimes she agreed with Grandma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lia , your nose is always in a book . Do n't you want to do things ? You need to meet people . Have more fun . " I always gave the same answer , wondering if Mom would even notice . " I am having fun . Reading is fun . " " You 're fifteen . You need to have friends . " " I have a friend . A best friend . Jolie . " " I mean lots of friends so you can do some fun things . " " Why should I have lots of friends ? I like being with Jolie . " Periodically Grandma and Mom would get so stirred up they 'd start a What to Do About Lia project . I 'd be signed up for lessons . The worst of all was when they wanted me to go to cheerleading camp . I found it easier to just go along , pay no attention to the other kids-who took the classes with great enthusiasm-and keep doing my own , untalented best .

We 'd have sleepovers at which we 'd read awesome and horrifying ghost stories to each other . My great-grandmother Sarah 's grip on my arm weakened , and she lay back against her pillow . Her eyelids , like brittle , yellowed paper , slowly slid shut . " I have to let you know about Graymoss , Anne , " she said . " And I have n't much time or energy to speak-listen to me . Not knowing what else to do , I muttered , " I 'm listening . " With a scared , sick feeling , I faced the fact that there might not be time to go for Mom . " You do know about Graymoss , do n't you ? " Sarah asked . Her eyelids fluttered open again , and she looked as if she were begging me to answer yes . " Graymoss . Yes , I know a little about it , " I replied . Actually , I 'd discovered the existence of Graymoss two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking through some old family albums . I 'd held up a pencil sketch of a large , graceful two-story house with verandas upstairs and down . Its roof was supported by rows of tall , white Ionic columns . " What 's this place in the picture ? " I asked Mom . " The one where someone 's written at the bottom ' Graymoss Plantation , 1831 . ' " Mom had leaned over my shoulder to study the sketch . " Graymoss was the Blevinses ' plantation home . That date must refer to the year it was built , " she said . " This is where the famous Charlotte Blevins lived ! " I said . I 'd been told often about Charlotte Blevins-my great-great-great-who had lived on Graymoss plantation as a child with her parents and grandparents . In 1861 , during the War Between the States , Charlotte 's parents and grandmother died . Later , when Charlotte was only sixteen , a detachment of the Union Army marched through that part of Louisiana , looting and burning many of the large plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte was able to persuade a Union officer to spare her home . It was n't burned or destroyed like most in the area . Charlotte proceeded to grow up and establish a school to teach former slaves and their children to read and write . She was a strong-minded , courageous woman who headed a long line of strong-minded , courageous women . " What happened to Graymoss after the Civil War ? " I 'd asked . Mom had shrugged . " I have no idea . Like many of those old plantations , it probably deteriorated years ago . I never liked that answer . It did n't satisfy me . In my mind I visualized a deeply green lawn rolling from the back veranda down to the Mississippi River , like the lawns at Oak Alley and some of the other well-kept plantation houses . Graymoss would be a quiet , peaceful place with big rocking chairs on the veranda , and when a light breeze blew , it would ruffle the pages of the book I was reading . I waited for Sarah to continue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family knew the answer to my question about the fate of Graymoss , she 'd be the one . I asked abruptly , " Great-grandmother , what happened to Graymoss ? " Sarah shuddered , and a strange , fearful look came into her eyes . She took a deep breath and seemed to be trying to gather strength , but her voice wavered as she answered , " Graymoss is there . It 's waiting . " My heart jumped . " You mean it ? Really ? Graymoss is still standing ? " Sarah closed her eyes again , but she continued to speak rapidly . " Listen to me , Anne . I 'm leaving Graymoss to you and not to Augusta . Augusta is headstrong and adamant about what should be done with Graymoss . If Augusta had her way Graymoss would be torn down . I ca n't let that happen . My attorney understands the provisions of Charlotte 's will . . . and mine . We must continue to protect the house . . . and care for it . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soft that I had to lean close to hear her , " Someone has actually cared for the house all these years ? " I asked , " Yes , There is a trust that takes care of taxes , repairs , expenses , and the caretaker 's salary . " " I do n't understand , " I told her , " If the house is still standing and is in good condition , then why has n't anyone in the family ever lived in it ? " Sarah sighed . Her lips barely moved as she said , " Read Charlotte 's diary . Then you 'll know . " " Know what , Great-grandmother ? What will I know ? " " Read the diary , " " Where is the diary ? Where will I find it ? " For just an instant Sarah 's fingers tightened on my arm , " We must save Graymoss , but stay far away from it , " she said , " The house is haunted by a terrible , fearful evil .
