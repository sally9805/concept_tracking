<p> Clayton  --  William Bartram was no dummy when he scaled the " exalted " northeast Georgia peak he named " Mount Magnolia " in 1775 . The famous naturalist was on my mind as I gasped my way up the steep quarter-mile ascent to the top of what is now known as Pinnacle Knob , just three miles east of Clayton . <p> We 21st-century hikers may enjoy high-tech gear , I mused , but Bartram was smart : He was on horseback . <p> Following the adventures of America 's first native-born naturalist 231 years later is something even the casual hiker can do , and just two hours from Atlanta . There are two spectacular waterfalls within two miles even if you skip the peak climb . <p> With my hiking companions , photographer Peter McIntosh and retired Clemson University professor John Ray , I rested on the rock outcrop atop Pinnacle Knob surveying the panoramic view Bartram called " the Cherokee mountains . " Bartram 's description of them is classic : " mountains piled on mountains . " <p> I was fortunate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Malcolm Skove , have written the only detailed Bartram Trail guidebooks , four of them , describing the 18th-century hikes through Georgia and North Carolina . ( The 37-mile-long Bartram Trail in North Georgia also connects to trails in South Carolina and provides access to the Appalachian Trail . ) <p> What did Bartram see from the top of Pinnacle Knob that we 're missing , I asked Ray as we gazed at countless shades of summer green against layers of ridgelines . Back then , the giant American chestnut would have dominated the hardwood tree stands , he said . The native chestnut , of course , succumbed to an Asian blight before the mid-1900s , though scientists are working today to bring it back . <p> Most of the trees Bartram so meticulously cataloged in his journal , and later in his 1791 book , are thriving : red maples , white oaks , hickory , beech , buckeye and tulip poplar . <p> The wild native magnolia , his treasured discovery and the one for which Bartram named this peak  --  he wrongly declared it the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it blooms in early May , its large shiny leaves , earlike lobes nearly a foot long , are striking all summer . <p> Only a tenth of a mile from the sign commemorating the Bartram Trail at Warwoman Dell parking area  --  from which hikers must cross back over Warwoman Road  --  is Becky Branch Falls . A second falls at Martin Creek is only two miles up the trail , which is marked with bright yellow blazes . It 's 3.7 miles to Courthouse Gap  --  a flat shady area for picnicking . A continuing trail , about nine miles long , leads to Rabun Bald and another to the quarter-mile ascent up Pinnacle Knob . <p> The wild magnolia the pioneering naturalist discovered should have been named the Bartram Magnolia , but naturalist Thomas Walter , who came upon it a decade later , published a book in 1788 naming it Magnolia fraseri after Englishman John Fraser , who collected plant specimens for him .

He was an avowed Patriot , although his father , John Bartram , had been appointed " Botanist Royal in America " by King George III . <p> William Bartram 's meticulous descriptions are more than just scientific observation ; his book is considered an American classic by scholars . He wrote about the environment with great emotion , and he influenced many Romantic-era European poets and literary figures . They were fascinated with his sensitive observations of Native Americans and with his poetic descriptions of nature . He was roundly criticized by his hometown Philadelphia newspaper , however , for his sympathetic accounts of the Seminole , Creek and Cherokee Indians he met . <p> The young Bartram , age 35 when he traveled Georgia , was funded by a British plant collector and physician , Dr. John Fothergill , to whom he sent plant specimens and drawings . Bartram traveled 2,500 miles through what are now eight Southern states : North and South Carolina , Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though much of his trek has succumbed to modern development , members of the Bartram Trail Conference , founded in 1976 , work to maintain trail access and initiate botanical gardens commemorating the journey . <p> According to Ray , no one knows the precise path Bartram traveled , but experts know the approximate route and can pinpoint many sites he visited because of his detailed descriptions . One of those is the dramatic second waterfall on this hike , Martin Creek Falls , which Bartram called Falling Creek . His description of the cascading falls might have been written today : <p> " Over successive ledges and sloping buttresses of solid rock , the waters drop and slide . . . . At one side , above the pool , is a cavernous recess in the rock , with a twilight atmosphere created by dense overhanging rhododendrons . . . . From the pool , as from the bottom of a well , one gazes far upward to a little patch of sky , closed in by the tops of mighty hemlocks and lesser beech , maple and tulip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike , I asked Ray why some trail guides identify Rabun Bald , Georgia 's second-highest peak , as Bartram 's " Magnolia mountain . " He said it is probably because today 's trail goes over Rabun Bald , which is higher than Pinnacle Knob and also home to wild magnolia . The current trail , he explained , utilizes public lands to track an approximation of Bartram 's travels . <p> According to Ray , Bartram never made it to the top of Rabun Bald . His writings indicate he followed an early army road built to route Indians near the current U.S. 441 . <p> Hikes nearly always include delightful surprises . Ours was seeing a ruffed grouse hen close-up . Ruffed grouse are normally easier to hear than to spot ; the male makes a drumming sound by flapping his wings furiously in a rumbling rhythm that resembles a motorcycle . To our amazement , the mama grouse stood perfectly still in front of us on a gravel road , as if she were a traffic cop , while her three babies crossed , one on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep reddish browns and blacks as if she 'd stepped out of a shiny wildlife book . <p> Unlike Bartram , who recorded natural wonders for posterity with precise artistry , we were helpless to capture the fleeting moment for fear our scramble for a camera would frighten her away . <p> Bartram 's original drawings from his Southeastern excursion are housed in the British Museum of Natural History . Aside from displays at his historic Philadelphia home and garden , the University of Georgia Library ( rare books section ) in Athens is one of a handful of American institutions that own a complete set of excellent copies . <p> Bartram 's stature has grown over the centuries . He is often called the 18th-century Thoreau , referring to better-known naturalist Henry David Thoreau , born in 1817 . But Thomas Slaughter , a Rutgers University history professor , says it would be more appropriate to describe Thoreau as the 19th-century Bartram . <p> IF YOU GO <p> Getting there <p> It 's about a two-hour drive from Atlanta to Bartram Trailhead near Clayton in Rabun County .
