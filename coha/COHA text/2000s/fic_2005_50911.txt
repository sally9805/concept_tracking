MY SISTER TELLS ME lieu 's TAXI RIDE will be free of charge today . Three years I 've been a driver for her and this is the first time anyone has ridden for free . I am to take him to Bien Hoa and wherever else he wants to go , all day if necessary , and if he insists on paying , I am still to refuse . Even a tip will be forbidden . <p> " He 's your cousin , " she is saying to me . " And this is his first time back . He 's brought his wife and kids a long way to visit us , so it 's the least we can do . " <p> " But it 's customary to tip in America , " I say . " He probably tips his mailman over there . It 'd be rude of me not to accept . " <p> My sister frowns at me . She is standing by the open window of my taxicab ( or her taxicab ) with one hand on the roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mother with that expression of calm disapproval on her face . She owes lieu a favor , for loaning her money to start her taxi company , and she reminds me again of this fact as if to tell me I have favors of my own to repay . <p> " Remember that woman 's luggage you forgot at the airport last month ? " she says , tapping me lightly on the shoulder . " Consider today a down payment on your amends . " When I do n't laugh , she sighs and says , " I 'm sorry your plans are ruined , Diem , but lieu 's the reason you and I can even talk about things like this . " <p> That 's always been a philosophy in our family : Never leave your debts unpaid , no matter how long it takes to repay or how much is owed . This refers to everything in life , of course , not just money , and if my father were talking to me , he 'd say it 's simply the balance of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaid in full . <p> But I 'm hardly feeling sentimental about my sister 's gesture . It 's me who 's giving up an afternoon at the park with my girlfriend . It 's me who 'll be working all day on short notice and for practically nothing . And what 's more , I have no idea where in Bien Hoa I 'm taking lieu or why , and neither does my sister because he told her nothing . Bien Hoa , which is almost an hour away , has Saigon 's crowds but none of its energy , and I imagine a hot and muggy afternoon idling in my cab , watching hustlers gamble in some narrow , deserted alley . My older sister , for all her great skill at running the business , has never spent an entire day driving someone around , or worse , waiting for them . <p> " If anything , spending the day with lieu will do you some good , " she insists . " It 'll give you both a chance to talk . " <p> " Talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she means for me to soak up lieu 's secrets to success in life , a life I should aspire to despite the differences that separate our worlds . All he 's gone through , she often says , and look where he is now . My sister likes to chide me for not being motivated or ambitious , for not taking things seriously enough , like the job she 's given me or the girlfriend I should either marry soon or drop altogether . Since she 's been supporting me and the family for years-two things I 'm admittedly bad at-keeping quiet is usually my only option . <p> I drive away without saying good-bye . In the rearview mirror , I see her watching me with her arms at her sides . Before I turn onto the main road , I stick my hand out the window and give her a quick wave . <p> At a quarter to noon , I arrive at the Rex hotel in downtown Saigon , and lieu is already waiting for me by the front square , smoking a cigarette and ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to sell him postcards and smokes . This morning my sister showed me a photo of lieu and his two young sons on some island beach-a vacation he took last year . I assumed his wife took the picture . lieu looks taller in person , and his aspect at the moment bears little resemblance to the man laughing in the photo . I approach him and shoo away the girl , and he turns to me with surprise , taking off his sunglasses to shake my hand . <p> " Diem ? Is that you ? " He regards my face thoughtfully as I shake his hand with my firmest grip . I think he is about to comment on how much I 've grown up , but instead he says , " I thought you were coming at eleven o'clock . " He squints , acting confused so as to hide the fact that he 's angry . I notice he 's nearly a head taller than I am . <p> " My sister told me noon , " I say , ready to tell him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to make sure I was on time . But he turns away from me and shouts hey to the little girl who comes running back with a pack of cigarettes . He pays her with a five-dollar American bill-four times what the pack is worth-and waves off her effort to make change , then pats me on the shoulder with a quick nod toward my cab . <p> He sits in the backseat , which only strangers do when they ride alone , and I remember his wife and children . I want to ask him where they are , since my sister told me his wife is half-American and very pretty , but his brusque manner keeps me silent . He puts on his sunglasses as we drive off . <p> Lieu and I are first cousins , and like my sister , he 's a good ten years older than I am . He was eighteen or so when he fled the country almost two decades ago . I hardly remember him at all , only that he used to visit our house every so often and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too young back then to understand or pay much attention to family affairs , but I 've learned over the years that he suffered a lot after the war . His father , an air force captain , spent two years in the reeducation camps after giai-phng , returned home with heart and drinking problems , and died a year later from a stroke . Shortly after this , lieu 's older brother escaped the country by boat and drowned in a storm at sea . lieu 's escape the next year was more successful , though he ended up toiling at the refugee camp in Kuala Lumpur for almost three years with no one to sponsor him . My sister tells me he nearly died twice in the camp , but I 've never taken the time to ask her how . <p> I glimpse him now in the rearview mirror , blowing smoke out the open window in his crisp , white shirt and expensive sunglasses , his hair neatly combed and gleaming , and I ca n't say I see a man who has suffered much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome , and now I see he has the healthy white skin and ample body weight of Viet-kieu who have lived a long time in America . I hear he owns a chain of Vietnamese restaurants in California and that he and his family live in a six-bedroom house with three cars . None of this impresses me except for the cars . One of these days , when I no longer have to rely on my sister for everything , I 'd like to drive a car that 's actually mine , take it on a trip all the way to Hanoi or Halong Bay and for once , like my cousin , know what it 's like to travel a long distance . <p> We are entering the highway that leads out of downtown Saigon , and traffic is particularly bad today . An old , rusty bus fuming black smoke passes into my lane and nearly sideswipes the cab , and I hear lieu grunt in the back , apparently unused to this kind of driving . He rolls up his window , and taking that as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioner embarrasses me , but I have n't had a chance to refill the Freon yet , not with my sister running me ragged for a week straight . <p> lieu is facing the window , rapt in solemn silence with his sunglasses now off , staring out at a Saigon that must be both familiar and utterly foreign to him-its shopping centers , its high-rise hotels and office buildings , its colorful new houses all jumbled into the old , unruly city he knew . His face , bronzed by sunlight and levitating above the jade crucifix ( a gift from my girlfriend ) that dangles from the rearview mirror , appears strangely deifie . I turn off the radio and slip in a cassette of American pop music , but he does n't seem to notice . <p> Traffic slows and car horns erupt . I honk a few times myself as motorbikes worm their way around me and through the congested traffic ahead . In the distance , I see the problem : a truck full of ducks or chickens has stalled in the middle of the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two we hardly move at all . <p> To the right of the highway , in a crowded church courtyard , a wedding party is taking place . I can see people hugging and laughing , children chasing each other across the square . The bride and groom stand beneath two towering palm trees , flanked by a number of wedding guests dressed in suits and colorful o dis . From where I am , I can make out the bride in her white gown , and for a moment it looks like she is pregnant . <p> " You married yet ? " lieu 's loud voice startles me . I look up and his eyes are staring at me in the rearview mirror . He nods in the direction of the wedding party . <p> " No , not yet , " I say with a small laugh . I see an opening in traffic and dart in front of the bus that passed me a few minutes ago . <p> " A girlfriend ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And what 's her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's asking these questions more out of boredom than out of sincere curiosity ; so , though I want to , I refrain from telling him that Tuyet is a medical student at the university , an intelligent and , in my opinion , very beautiful girl from a good , Catholic family . She also cuts hair and is helping me save money for a new Honda moped so that I do n't have to drive her around in my sister 's stranger-worn cab . <p> Lieu is quiet for a moment . " You love her , do n't you ? " He says this , his voice deep and thoughtful , as though I 'd been hiding it from him all along . " I can tell by the way you do n't want to say anything about her . " <p> I shrug my shoulders and avoid his eyes in the mirror . <p> " How long have you known her ? " <p> " Two years , " I say hesitantly , though I do feel compelled to lay out the facts . I turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year now . " <p> " You 're what , twenty-four , twenty-five ? Here 's some advice . If she 's the right one , marry her as soon as you can . Impress her parents , buy her a nice little ring . Forget all the other girls , who 're no good anyway . " <p> " I 'm really in no hurry , " I say , " and I do n't think she is either . " Actually , I want to ask him how he can presume to know my intentions , my feelings for anyone . I look in the mirror and his head has fallen back on the headrest , his eyes nearly closed . <p> " You know , my wife and I met in the States , " he continues , " but I nearly married someone else here . I doubt if you knew that back then , young as you were . " <p> " I did n't . " <p> " Yeah , we were together not long before I left . She was a pretty one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He chuckles . " I wanted us to get married and planned on proposing , but then I thought I 'd wait until things in the family were better-you know , with Father and Linh recently gone . We were both young anyway . " lieu takes off his seatbelt and settles deeper into his seat , sinking a bit from view in the mirror . " Then she went and fell in love with a friend of mine , someone I 'd known throughout school ; I actually saved his neck once in a fight . They went on for months behind my back , and sometimes right in my face . I was blind . When I finally found out , I broke things off like that- " and he snaps his fingers . He speaks casually , flippantly , and I 'm not sure if he even cares whether I 'm listening . But then his tone changes : " You know , that 's the reason I left . Not because of the country , the way it was . Or because Father and Linh had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without telling her . Once I got to Kuala Lumpur , I heard she was devastated and dropped him , asked my family if I had written , whether or not I made it there all right . I told them to ignore her , shut her out of anything concerning me . To hell with her and everything- " He stops abruptly , almost angrily , and says nothing more . <p> I feel like I 've just eavesdropped on a private conversation and am not quite sure what to say . I imagine him telling his wife this story ; I imagine her wondering if she was the next best thing . After a long silence , I remember to turn up the music . <p> Traffic slows again . Up ahead an army of large trucks is creeping onto the highway , their cargo covered with tarpaulin . They 're headed , as they have been for a month now , toward the construction of the new highway that will lead straight to Vung Tau . Soon it 'll take two rather than four hours to drive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Tuyet to the beaches there next week , to make up for our lost afternoon today . I will even buy her a new bathing suit , a nice foreign brand . <p> " Traffic here has n't changed at all , " lieu mutters . He leans forward , puts his hands on the shoulders of the front seats . " We 're still downtown , are n't we ? Let 's stop somewhere for a bit . All the fumes , all this stopping and going have given me a headache . " <p> " We still have almost an hour before we get to Bien Hoa , " I remind him . <p> " That 's fine . We have enough time . There 's actually a place on Le Duan Street that I 'd like to visit , if it 's still there . A small restaurant where we can get a quick drink . " <p> I sigh in my head , disappointed that he 's apparently no longer in a hurry . Through a throng of Vespas , I maneuver the cab across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Centre , where traffic on a Friday is bad enough to confuse any driver , and finding this restaurant lieu mentioned is as difficult as I thought it 'd be . I do n't recognize the name of the place , nor does he remember exactly where it 's located . I offer to take him to a number of decent cafs , but he insists on this one , despite everything that has changed in the city , despite the likelihood that it might now be the first floor of a karaoke bar . But finally , to my surprise , after nearly half an hour of driving in circles , we spot the restaurant : a small caf wedged between a computer store and an Italian ice cream shop , with a neon sign overhead that reads Caf 33 . There is an empty parking spot by the front curb that I slip into , thankful for my first stroke of luck today . <p> As soon as lieu steps out of the cab , three children and an elderly man hurry up to him , holding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their outstretched hands . They follow us to the entrance of the restaurant , where the attendant waves them off with an impatient flick of his wrist . <p> Lieu stops and takes a long look at the place . " This is it , " he says to me and points at the front patio . " That girl I told you about , she and I came here all the time and used to sit right there . Everything 's changed , of course , and it was called something else back then , but it 's still the same place . " <p> The attendant leads us onto the patio , and as I walk behind lieu , I ask myself why he 'd bother revisiting a place where bad memories might follow him . <p> " Two Tiger beers , " he tells the waitress as soon as we are seated . <p> " I ca n't drink- " <p> He waves a hand in my face and nods at the waitress to go ahead . Lighting a cigarette , he offers me one , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of his in one gulp before sitting back in his chair and facing the inside of the restaurant . His survey of the place is slow and complete , roving over the bamboo tables and chairs , the lavender walls adorned with neon beer signs and posters of singers and movie stars . I ca n't tell if he recognizes anything , but I hear him sigh as he settles his gaze on traffic . <p> " It 's amazing that we managed to find this place , " I say . <p> He does n't appear to hear me . Across the street , there is a homeless woman standing on the grassy median , swathed in a black , tattered o di with her face done up in garish makeup . As cars rush past her on both sides , she stands there and performs exaggerated Tai Chi Chuan movements , pushing invisible walls , drawing invisible arcs in the air with a closed paper fan , her head tilted all the while like a Thai dancer's. lieu turns to me with an uncertain grin , both amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His beer nearly finished , he holds up two fingers to the waitress , who promptly brings over two more bottles . <p> " So where is it that I 'm taking you in Bien Hoa ? " I ask him . <p> Lieu pulls a pen from his pocket and thinks for a long moment , then carefully writes something on a napkin . He hands the napkin to me with an address on it . I do n't recognize it as anyone 's I know , nor am I even familiar with that area of the town . I tuck the napkin in my shirt pocket . <p> lieu 's attention wanders from the table again . There is no awkwardness in his silence . Taking long drags from his cigarette with his beer constantly in hand , he seems perfectly satisfied , as though he has forgotten me . I look at my watch and take another cigarette from his pack . <p> We sit smoking quietly for a long while until two young women , probably Australian or European tourists , walk past the caf wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me under his breath , as though it is a mystery to him , " You know , American women are n't as dark down there . And some are completely shaven . " <p> I blush , and drink my beer to hide it . For some reason , it feels like my father has just said this to me , and if I were to add anything it would only make things more uncomfortable . There 's something patronizing in what lieu 's said , and it makes me think of the one other girl I slept with before Tuyet , possibly the only girl I 'll ever be with aside from her . I find myself startled by a jolt of envy . I say the first thing that comes to mind : " Where 's your wife today ? And your kids ? " <p> He glances at me sideways with a flash of amusement in his eyes . " I think she took them to that new water park . A water park-in Saigon ! Who owns it , the French ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my girlfriend , but it 's pretty expensive . " <p> " Malaysians are probably the only ones who can afford to go there . " <p> " Should n't we get going soon ? " <p> Lieu pats the air in front of me . " Do n't be in such a hurry now . We have plenty of time . All day , in fact . " He nudges another beer toward me and gestures again at the waitress . " One thing I learned from my time in Kuala Lumpur is that there 's always plenty of time for everything . " <p> " Did n't you tell me just half an hour ago that I should rush out and marry my girlfriend ? " <p> Smiling , he points a finger at me . " Ah , so you 're not as timid as I thought you were . " <p> I glance at the street , trying my best not to grin . I consider what he just said . " So what was it like in Kuala Lumpur ? I heard it was hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says and shrugs nonchalantly . " I was sick awhile . Hepatitis . I lay in bed for six months and lost more weight than any grown man should . And then a year after getting better , I went and got myself stabbed in a fight . " He leans back and pats the right side of his abdomen as if he 's full from a good meal . I 'm expecting him to unbutton his shirt and show off a scar , but he only peers at the spot his hand is covering . " Both times I thought it was the end , " he declares . <p> " Which was worse ? " <p> Lieu shakes his head . " There was no worse . Thing is , I remember very little about those months in bed , aside from the sheer misery of being ill and helpless . And the stabbing-well , I 'm not even sure now how I got into the fight . Some fool decided he disliked me one night , and we got into it . I 've completely forgotten his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd never forget what he looked like . " <p> Lieu is shaking his head again . " Yes , but you 've never had anything happen to you . " <p> I look at him and laugh a little . I think of when I failed at school , of the two times I crashed the cab and nearly missed killing myself and my passengers , of the night I lost all my savings in a billiards game . " What do you mean ? " I say . <p> Chuckling to himself , he coolly drinks his beer , which at once irritates me . A second time he 's done it now , and I 've a mind to tell him he has no right , coming from such a distance with his house and cars and pretty wife , to assume anything about me . I never left as he did . Has he been gone so long that he 's forgotten where he is ? <p> Lieu puts out his cigarette . His smile fades , replaced by an air of restlessness as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin . With his elbows on the table , his face flushing faintly from the beer , he stares at the ashtray and says to me , " Those three years on the island were about as long as the twenty I 've lived since . And yet with everything that happened , with all that I went through back then , the thing I think about most nowadays is my old girlfriend cheating on me . Funny , is n't it ? " He gives me a questioning look , surprised apparently by his own statement , as if he only just now realized how profound it is . He continues in a subdued voice , " You know , she sent me a letter two years ago . Told me she still thinks of me , that she still loves me . She apologized . I do n't know how she found my address . I had to hide the letter from my wife . " <p> He takes a long , slow swig from his beer , finishing it , then stands abruptly to leave . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I might be taking him to this woman 's house . <p> As we approach the cab , he stops and looks at his watch . Hesitating a moment , he walks back to the attendant . " You sell wine ? " The attendant nods . " I 'd like a bottle of red wine . Whatever brand you have is fine . " Lieu hands him a few bills and , when the attendant turns to leave , adds , " And is the owner here ? Could I speak to him ? " <p> The attendant looks at me , then back at Lieu , apparently taking him for an important person . <p> " I 'm an old customer , " says lieu , as though it should be obvious . <p> Without a word , the attendant disappears into the caf . I go and stand by my cab as Lieu waits at the entrance . I soon notice the homeless woman from across the street making her way toward us , and though I ignore her , she approaches me directly , stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome boy , " she purrs at me in an unexpectedly rich voice , her smile toothy and brilliant . She 's older than I thought , her face heavily powdered , a Kabuki mask of crudely drawn eyebrows , rouged cheeks , and smeared , bright red lipstick . I want to look away but can not help feeling a little flattered . At least she 's not asking for money . <p> She turns and sees lieu , and now begins slowly approaching him . I know I should get rid of her , or at least warn him , but his comments a few minutes ago are still gnawing at me . Sure enough , when lieu sees her , he nearly jumps a step away . <p> " Look how handsome he is , " she proclaims , turning to me for agreement . She ca n't be any taller than lieu 's chest . Leaning forward , she clasps a closed fan to her breast and stares unabashedly at him as if at some beautiful statue . " So handsome ... " <p> lieu turns his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she edges closer , he takes another step toward the entrance of the caf . Just then the owner , a man about lieu 's age , appears at the door with a dark bottle of wine in one hand . He hands it to lieu who , perhaps to drown out the woman 's voice , thanks him rather loudly . As they shake hands , he adds , " This was once Ong Thu 's restaurant , right ? " <p> The owner laughs cheerfully , glad that someone remembers . " Yes , yes it was ! Thu was a friend of my father 's and sold it to him about ten years ago . I took things over not too long ago . " Then he adds proudly , " I 've since redone the place . " <p> " Yes , I noticed . " <p> " You live in America , do n't you ? Did you know Ong Thu ? " <p> " I knew his son , a friend of mine from school . " <p> " Yes , the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently he ran things for a few years and did n't do that good a job . That 's when his father sold to my father . " <p> " How tall and handsome , " the old woman is still saying , turning excitedly from me to the owner . " Look at him . " <p> The owner glances at her but continues smiling at lieu . <p> Lieu says , " You do n't know what Thu and his son are doing nowadays , do you ? " <p> " Well , I have n't spoken to the family in years , not since they all moved away . But last I heard , Thu lost his wife to cancer , and I believe his son , your friend , served some time in jail for burglary . Very tough for Thu , I imagine . " <p> " It must be , " lieu mutters to himself , cradling the wine bottle in one arm . He appears distracted for a moment and does n't seem to notice that the old woman is now standing right beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and says irritably , " Yes , yes , woman . Leave me alone . " <p> She is still smiling lavishly at him and now takes ahold of his wrist . lieu pulls his arm back at once , glaring at her . As soon as she reaches for it again , he shoves her away with a sweep of his arm . She stumbles backward a few steps , loses her footing , and before I can move to catch her , hits the concrete hard . With her legs splayed on the sidewalk , she looks around blindly as though waking from a nap . <p> I rush to help her up , and when Lieu does the same , I turn to him and whisper angrily , " What 's wrong with you ? " <p> A few customers from the patio are staring . The owner , who appears both shocked and a little embarrassed , snaps at the attendant to come fix the situation . The old woman is unhurt apparently , and as the attendant leads her away gently by the arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what just happened , her face alive again with a mad happiness . <p> I see lieu standing beside the owner , gripping the neck of the wine bottle in one hand . He notices the old woman 's fan on the ground , picks it up , and after a moment of indecision hands it sheepishly to the owner , who receives it with an awkward smile . I walk to the cab . For once lieu walks behind me . <p> We are on the highway again . It 's not yet two o'clock , but I feel like this trip began three or four hours ago . seeing lieu in the backseat with the bottle in his lap , I first guess that he 's taking this wine to his old girlfriend 's house ; but we 've only driven about ten minutes before I hear the cork pop and watch him in the rearview mirror bringing the bottle to his lips . <p> He still has n't spoken to me , which is fine ; my job is to stay silent and drive . If he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know what to say . And what 's more , I 'm beginning to feel complicit in some treacherous scheme . Is it a secret rendezvous I 'm taking him to ? I picture my girlfriend 's reaction tonight when I tell her the story : Returning to your long lost love is no good reason for betraying your wife , she 'd say . Lost love is simply that-lost . <p> But perhaps lieu is running from something . A loveless wife , for instance . Visions of a failing marriage jump to my mind : their arguments at dinner , their silence in cars , an unacknowledged affair between them . I 'm reminded of lieu 's advice to me earlier , and though it feels silly , the thought of Tuyet as my wife makes me imagine , for a moment at least , my own unhappy marriage . <p> I glance again at lieu in the back and feel the urge both to sympathize and to roll my eyes . Why , after so many years , after so much contemplation , is he revisiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every minute or so , even though music is playing in the cab , I can hear him kiss the lip of the bottle . He stares out the window like someone gazing at both the past and the future . <p> At half past two , we approach Bien Hoa . I exit the highway and find that we are going to a less populated area of the city , away from the tall buildings and crowded tenements . Patches of farmland and green pasture break up the dense neighborhoods , and there are some children playing in the streets as well as a water buffalo or two grazing near the roadside . There are also many trees , and with the sun glaring as it is now , I 'm hoping to find a spot soon beneath a crowd of palms where both the car and I can cool off . <p> Lieu tells me to stop somewhere with a toilet , his first words to me in over a half hour . I pull over at another caf , and he jumps out holding the wine bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now fully flushed . <p> Once we get going again , he asks me what time it is ; when I tell him , he says in a slow , dull voice , " Will you be able to find it ? " <p> " We do n't have much farther to go , " I reply , and he returns to his silence . <p> Within ten minutes , we reach the entrance of the neighborhood I 'm looking for , and I turn into a narrow , gravel road shaded by a wall of breadfruit trees . It is quiet here , hardly anyone outside . Small houses with dingy , stuccoed walls line the roadside , and my cab 's side mirror nearly scrapes their front gates as we pass by . The road soon opens a little into a half circle of houses built so close together that they look conjoined . I check the address on the napkin and stop the car in front of the pale blue house . <p> I turn to the backseat. lieu has yet to move . He is peering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , his face an inch from the window . <p> " Is this it ? " I ask him . <p> " That 's the address , " he replies quietly . It appears he , too , has never been here . Opening the door , he turns to me and says , not unkindly , " Thank you , Diem . " <p> He walks toward the porch , his gait no longer quick and assured but more like that of someone who just awoke . No sooner does he reach the porch than he stops and returns to the cab , dipping his head into the passenger window . My hand is resting on the shifter , and into it he awkwardly crumples a fifty-dollar bill and gapes at me with wide , bloodshot eyes . " Your sister probably told you not to , but take this and buy something for your girlfriend . And Diem , please do n't talk about this to anyone , especially anyone in the family . Just tell them you brought me to visit an old friend . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My gut tells me I should feel insulted , but instead , for the first time today , I feel like we are actually cousins . <p> I lean toward him and say , " Is this her house ? " <p> He grins at me suddenly , a little sloppily , and says , " Wait for me . I wo n't be too long . " He mounts the porch this time and disappears under the shade of a large plum tree that has grown into an appendage of the house . From my window , I can hear a metal door sliding open , a few dull voices , and after some silence the door sliding shut . <p> I feel uneasy sitting in the cab and decide to wait outside . A neighboring house has a small shop in its front room , and I wander over there to keep myself busy . The shop sells everything from toothpaste to shoes . I notice a couple of leather handbags in the corner . A pretty girl about my age sits reading a magazine on a stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . She looks up when I approach and nods shyly , smiling . She turns down the music and puts her magazine aside , glancing at me as she shuffles some paper on the counter . <p> I walk over to the handbags . They 're well made , the leather sturdy and soft , but I 'm taken aback by the price tags . " Those bags are made in Italy , " the shopgirl volunteers from her counter . Her voice is small and apologetic . She nods eagerly when I ask permission to use the phone on the wall . I turn away from her as I dial Tuyet 's number . She is not at home , but her sister is quick to mention that Tuyet was disappointed about our canceled trip to the park . Before I hang up , I remind her to tell Tuyet that I called . <p> I look over at the pale blue house . Awash in the shadows of the plum tree , it appears deserted . I remember the night two years ago when I first met Tuyet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ever been to Hanoi . I lied and told her I had gone there as a child . I now regret the fact that she still believes this . <p> The shopgirl is standing on a stool and quietly rearranging the wall of videos behind the counter . Her hair-unlike Tuyet 's , which is bobbed-falls past her shoulders . <p> I pick up the phone again and dial my sister 's number , mindful of what lieu asked of me . When I reach her , I tell her that I do n't know when I 'll be back in town , but that everything is fine . Without hesitating , my sister says a client called and said I was late picking up his family at the airport yesterday , and that I drove too fast on the way home . She sounds exasperated with me , but there 's a tinge of humor in her voice , as if she 's no longer mad enough to scold me . Lowering my voice , I tell her traffic was bad yesterday and that I was making up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel her shaking her head at me . When I tell her that Tuyet is upset with me , she seems to soften and is pleasant when she says good-bye . <p> As soon as I hang up , I decide to buy one of the leather handbags , a black one big enough to carry all of Tuyet 's things , even her books . She 's not a showy girl , but the bag will make her stand out nicely at the university . I pay the shopgirl with the money lieu gave me , forgoing the usual bargaining , and her eyes light up when she sees the American bill . She carefully wraps the handbag in newspaper . " For your girlfriend ? " she asks . I nod and return her smile , feeling both impressive and somewhat awkward . <p> Before she can count out my change , a woman 's high-pitched scream startles us both . I turn toward the house lieu entered , and another scream rings out . There are crashing sounds , then the shattering of glass . As I hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice this time . <p> My hurry turns into an all-out sprint when I see lieu 's form stumbling onto the porch . A stocky man comes rushing out after him and throws a fist in his face . lieu staggers to the edge of the porch , where he turns in time to lift his feet and go tripping down the four steps , nearly crashing into the branches of the plum tree near the bottom . By the time I reach him , lieu is already on his feet , floundering a little but glaring steadily at the man on the porch . <p> I step in front of lieu , glancing from him to the man above us , who is standing astride with his fists clenched . The last time I hit someone was in high school , and I lost that fight , but my glimpse of lieu 's bloody teeth makes me stand my ground . Then I see that the man on the porch is bleeding badly from the nose , and as furious as he was a second ago , he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose repeatedly with a finger . I notice a tattoo of a dragon running down his arm and the deep , leathery tan of too many days in the sun . Faint voices come from within the house . <p> I feel invisible . The man continues staring at lieu , his posture and hands relaxed now , as if the thought of throwing another punch bores him . There is sadness in his face , a glint of pity in the downward gaze , and hearing lieu 's soft wheezing at my back I think I understand why . " lieu ... " he finally says , uttering the name like some disappointed father . Without another word he turns and walks back into the house , and the metal door grinds shut . <p> Behind me lieu has already opened the door of the cab . <p> It is not until I turn the car around that I see the neighbors standing by their doorsteps and windows , staring at us as we slowly drive away . I look at lieu , sitting in the front seat now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his shirt spotted with blood , and my first reaction is to feel ashamed for him in the eyes of the neighbors . <p> " What did you do ? " I demand , a little too loudly . <p> lieu does n't say anything , and I 'm already annoyed by the thought of driving him home in silence . But he begins laughing quietly to himself , then a little louder , until finally his shoulders start shaking and he has to cover his mouth to keep from spitting blood on my dashboard . <p> " What 's the matter with you ? " I say , not quite sure if he 's sobered yet . I take the caf napkin from my pocket and hand it to him . " Who was that back there ? " <p> " I got him good in the face , " lieu gasps . " I must have broken his nose ! He thought I would forget-he thought after all this time I 'd let it go . " He stops laughing long enough to wipe the blood from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been laughing at me . <p> He soon grows quiet but watches the road ahead of us with a sliver of a grin on his face . I steer the cab through traffic a little recklessly , recalling details of our trip this afternoon . I want to ask him why , with everything he did tell me , he did not tell me about this ; but it seems asking about anything that led up to today would be like asking him why he bleeds . <p> At a stop in traffic , he holds the door ajar and spits blood several times onto the street . A cyclo driver in a dingy shirt and cap is idling by our cab and staring lazily at lieu. lieu notices him and shuts the door . He takes out his wallet , empties it of cash and credit cards , and tosses it out the window at the cyclo driver , who fumbles it like a hot coal against his chest and gives us a stupefied look . As I drive on , lieu turns to me , blood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone asks , just say someone robbed me-but tell them I put up a good fight . " <p> We are half an hour away from Saigon , and lieu is snoring softly , slumped in his seat . His left eye is noticeably swollen , dried blood curls over his lower lip . I offered twice to take him to a doctor , but he refused both times . <p> Traffic is backed up as we approach the Saigon River bridge . A parade of pedestrians crowds the roadside , walking to and from the bridge 's boardwalk up ahead . There are vendors prowling among them , and to those who approach me , I shoot my meanest glare . A gaggle of eager ones assault the red touring van next to me , holding up maps , books , and woven hammocks . The van is full of Viet-kieu who , despite the weather , are adorned in sports jackets and silk scarves . It must be a family of twelve or so people , and one of them is telling a story up front and gesturing wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I can still hear the laughter . A young man takes pictures of the vendors with a small camera as they walk alongside the van , waving their wares stubbornly at his window . <p> The van moves ahead of me a few paces . Two young boys in the back are staring at my cab . One looks about five , the other a couple years older , both wearing identical baseball caps that are too big for them . I crawl forward in traffic until they 're nearly abreast of my door , a few meters away , and I see now that they 're staring at lieu . <p> The younger boy opens his window and shouts something at me in English , which I do n't entirely understand . The older boy nudges him impatiently and interprets for me , nodding his head at lieu : " Is he dead ? " <p> I 'm tempted to say yes . But I tell them , " He was robbed . " <p> Their eyes widen . The younger boy leans over the seat in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing with the other adults , but at the boy 's insistence , she looks over at me , then at lieu , and her smile vanishes . She reaches back casually and closes the boys ' window . Before I know it , she 's roaring with laughter again . The van pulls away from me , but the two boys continue to stare at lieu with blank , patient faces . They are buried in youth , I think , they know nothing of what may come . <p> I roll up my window . Traffic finally speeds up , and when I shift gears , lieu 's head falls onto his shoulder . He does n't stir . His snoring sounds childlike and weak . <p> I want to laugh at how absurd the day has been , at what he ended up doing . It 's because of love , he 'd probably say , though I suspect the truth of the matter is bigger and inexplicable . There must be a pain in the world that will follow people like their shadow , despite the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion . I 've apparently envied lieu all this time , for only now do I see how different I want us to be . <p> I cross the Saigon River , its calm waters burnished white by the sun , and remember the handbag I bought for Tuyet . A loud curse escapes me . I failed at my one good thing today , and this somehow makes it easier to admit I love her , as much as lieu believes and my sister has hoped . But the river 's glare is momentarily blinding , the rumbling traffic outside like distant thunder , and I feel strangely disheartened . <p> Up ahead I see the red van again . Suddenly it swerves and darts around a stalled cyclo driver , weaving drunkenly before it regains control-my heart leaps , and in that instant I imagine myself that driver , the van crashing into me , my body pinned beneath the wheels as I hear above me the sound of laughter . <p>                  @ @ @
