. Who says you ca n't take it with you ? Here are the most efficient ways to get wireless Internet access from your boat . MOST OF US ARE ADDICTED TO E-MAIL , either because we wo n't stop working or ca n't stand being out of touch . Fortunately , it 's getting easier than ever to tap into the Internet from a boat . Whether you 're living aboard or just cruising for an afternoon , you can have high-speed wireless Internet access , if you want it . There are three ways to get a wireless connection on board : through a marina hot spot ; through a wireless service ( aircard ) offered by one of the wireless phone companies ; and via satellite . Each service has its advantages and disadvantages , and they vary in terms of both connection speeds and costs . Here 's a look at all three , along with a guide to some of the new , marine-related products that can enhance service and range . Marina Hot Spots These are like the hot spots you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-speed wireless Internet connection that you can buy for the day , week , month or whenever you need it . The downside is range : Hot spots typically have a range of only a few hundred feet from the tower . For that reason , some boaters are skeptical about the real usefulness of marina hot spots . Russell Schmidt is cofounder of Beacon Wi-Fi ( www.beaconwifi.com ) . His company has wired up more than 175 marinas on the eastern seaboard , and that number is growing . At best , says Schmidt , Beacon 's coverage area extends out to about a mile around the marina . Given the fact that wireless aircards work anywhere , why would a boater want to rely on this type of service ? The major reason , says Schmidt , is speed . Beacon Wi-Fi customers are connecting at broadband speeds of five to 10 mbps , roughly 10 times faster than the connection you 'll get with a wireless aircard . " A lot of our marinas blow away even T1 lines , " says Schmidt . Flexible pricing is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the online time you need ( Beacon 's pricing ranges from $12 per day to $30 per month with a one-year contract ) . Assuming your laptop already has a built-in wireless device , there 's nothing else to buy , unless you want to extend your range . There is one other advantage of a marina hot spot : It works where there 's poor or no wireless coverage , in places like Block Island , R.I. If your cruising lifestyle involves hopping from one place to the next , marina hot-spot service can be a fast and affordable solution . Many Beacon customers plan their cruises based on the marinas that are covered by the network . " If you 're on a connection plan at your homeport and you cruise to another marina we cover , " says Schmidt , " it costs you nothing extra at the new marina to get connected . " Wireless Aircards If , on the other hand , you marinahop and anchor out , a wireless aircard from one of the major cell-phone providers could be a good choice . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage , and you can connect even while under way . With an aircard , you have the ability to get on www.weather.com or download satellite weather feeds from Sirius or XM Satellite Radio . That 's a big advantage when weather is threatening and you 're trying to decide whether to push on or head for safe harbor . Three of the major wireless providers are Cingular , Sprint and Verizon . To get connected with these companies you need to buy an external card that slides into a slot on your laptop . This card is actually a radio receiver/transmitter , and while the connection speeds are not nearly as fast as those for a marina hot spot , they 're fast enough to be in the broadband category . In addition to the wireless aircard ( a one-time purchase ) you must also sign up for a coverage plan . The Shakespeare Solution As good as wireless aircards are on land , the cell-phone system was not built for marine applications , and as a result , service generally drops out anytime you 're more than about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works on the laptop to which it 's connected . To address those limitations , Shakespeare ( www.shakespeare-ce.com ) has developed a product specifically for boaters that works with existing cell phone/data services . The product is so new it has n't been named yet , but according to Don Henry , Shakespeare 's vice president of marketing , it 's commercial-grade for marine applications . Due to launch in 2006 , " it includes a cell-phone box , a wireless router and a power adapter , " says Henry . " With it , your boat becomes its own ' hot spot , ' which means multiple computers can connect to the onboard network at the same time . " And , if you buy an eight-foot whip antenna , your coverage range and connection speeds will increase . With a system like this aboard , you can get into remote system monitoring , video surveillance and more , since  --  unlike a standard aircard  --  this Internet connection system is always on . Web on TV KVH has come up with a system that also works with cellular services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to the Internet via your onboard TV screen . The system is called the TracNet 100 Mobile Internet receiver , and it works using MSN 's TV service . The result , according to KVH ( www.kvh.com ) , is the first inmotion product to offer consumers easy-to-use , high-speed Internet access on the television screens already installed on their boats . The system also includes Wi-Fi output to provide connectivity to a wide range of Wi-Fienabled products . In terms of hardware , the system consists of a set-top box , a wireless keyboard and a remote control that allows the user to interact with the MSN TV service , send e-mail , surf the Web and more . The system requires a Kyocera aircard and works only with Verizon Wireless , but it does come with a three-watt signal booster and a mast antenna to increase signal strength and range . TracNet 100 is priced at $2,395 . Cell Phone to Satellite All the services covered here depend on cellular phone coverage , which is limited to about two miles offshore . So if you 're cruising beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . KVH 's smallest voice/data unit is the F33 ( the stabilized antenna weighs just 10 pounds ) , which offers Internet access from anywhere in the world , under way or at rest . Unlike traditional satellite phone/data services that typically charge you on a per-minute basis , the F33 is set up so you only pay for the data you send and receive , not for time connected . List price for the F33 is $12,490 , and the usage charge is $3.50 per megabyte transferred . There are a number of ways you can haul the Net aboard , and at a price that ranges from a 24-hour connection fee at a marina hot spot to the more substantial investment required for satellite voice and data communications . Now there 's no reason to leave the office behind  --  unless , of course , you want to . This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF . Table <p>
