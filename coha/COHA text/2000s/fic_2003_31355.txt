Chapter One Demon wind greeted pallid daylight with hell howl fury . It was no true daylight , although somewhere above the clouds of seething black the sun had heaved itself once more into the heavens . It was only the devil 's own twilight , slashed with body-smashing sheets of rain and spray , the rolling concussion of thunder , the bellow of wind , and the endless keen of rigging , all punctuated by the sodden percussion of torn canvas flailing to destruction . Sir George Wincaster , Third Baron of Wickworth , clung to a stay , feeling it quiver and groan with strain while he kept to his feet by raw , hopeless force of will alone . The lifeline the vessel 's captain had lashed about him when the hideous gale first burst upon them yesterday morning had ringed his chest in bruises , salt sores stung his lips , and rain and spray had soaked into his very marrow . He felt as if heavy horse had charged over him and back again , and despair was a leaden fist about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain 's terror when first the weather broke , for he was a soldier , not a sailor . Now he understood only too well , and he watched almost numbly as the battered cog , creaking and groaning in every frame and stringer , corkscrewed down yet another mountainous , slate-gray wave , streaked with seething bands of spray and foam , and buried its round-cheeked prow deep . Water roared the length of the hull , poison-green and icy as death , plucking and jerking at his limbs and groping after every man on the staggering ship 's deck . The hungry sheet of destruction smashed over Sir George , battering the breath from him in yet another agonized grunt , and then it was past and he threw his head up , gasping and hacking on the water which had forced itself into his nostrils and eyes . The cog fought her way once more up out of the abyss , wallowing as the water cascaded off her deck through buckled rails . Broken cordage blew out , bar-straight and deadly as flails on the howling torrent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torment . Sir George was a landsman , yet even he felt the ship 's heavier motion , knew the men-and women-laboring frantically at the pumps and bailing with buckets , bowls , even bare hands , were losing ground steadily . The vessel was doomed . All the ships of his expedition were doomed ... and there was nothing he could do about it . The unexpected summer gale had caught them at the worst possible moment , just as they were rounding the Scilly Isles on their way from Lancaster to Normandy . There had been no warning , no time to seek shelter , only the desperate hope that they might somehow ride out the storm 's violence on the open sea . And that hope had failed . Sir George had seen only one ship actually die . He was uncertain which , but he thought it had been Earl Cathwall 's flagship . He hoped he was wrong . It was unlikely any of them would survive , but Lord Cathwall was more than the commander of the expedition . He was also Sir George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate respect . And perhaps Sir George was wrong . The dying ship had been almost close enough to hear the shrieks of its doomed company even through the storm 's demented howl as it was pounded into the depths , but the darkness and storm fury , broken only by the glare of forked lighting , had made exact identification impossible . Yet even though it was the only ship he had seen destroyed , he was grimly certain there had been others . Indeed , he could see only one other vessel still fighting its hopeless battle , and he ground his teeth as yet another heavy sea crashed over his own cog . The impact staggered the ship , and a fresh chorus of screams and prayers came faintly from the men and women and children packed below its streaming deck . His wife Matilda and their son Edward were in that dark , noisome hellhole of crowded terror and vomit , of gear come adrift and washing seawater , and terror choked him as he thought of them once again . He tried to find the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save his wife and his son . He did not beg for himself . It was n't his way , and his was the responsibility for bringing them to this in the first place . If God wanted his life in exchange for those so much dearer to him , it was a price he would pay without a whimper . Yet he knew it was a bargain he would not be permitted . He and Matilda and Edward would meet their ends together , crushed by the soulless malice and uncaring brutality of sea and wind , and deep within him bitter protest reproached the God who had decreed that they should . The cog shuddered and twitched , heaving in the torment of over-strained timbers and rigging , and Sir George looked up as the ship 's mate shouted something . He could n't make out the words , but he knew it was a question , and he shook himself like a sodden dog , struggling to make his mind function . For all his ignorance of the sea , he had found himself doomed to command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , he 'd done little more than agree with the mate 's suggestions , lending his authority to the support of a man who might-might ! - know enough to keep them alive a few hours more . But the mate had needed that support , needed someone else to assume the ultimate responsibility , and that was Sir George 's job . To assume responsibility . No , to acknowledge the responsibility which was already his . And so he made himself look as if he were carefully considering whatever it was the mate wanted to do this time , then nodded vigorously . The mate nodded back , then bellowed orders at his exhausted , battered handful of surviving sailors . Wind howl and sea thunder thrashed the words into meaningless fragments so far as Sir George could tell , but two or three men began clawing their way across the deck to perform whatever task the mate had decreed , and Sir George turned his face back to the sea 's tortured millrace . It did n't really matter what the mate did , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of life they might otherwise have clung to ; at best , a brilliant maneuver might buy them an hour or two they might not otherwise have had . In the end , the result would be the same . He 'd had such hopes , made so many plans . A hard man , Sir George Wincaster , and a determined one . A peer of the realm , a young man who had caught his monarch 's favor at Dupplin and the siege of Berwick at the age of twenty-two , who 'd been made a knight by Edward III 's own hand the next year on the field of Halidon Hill . A man who 'd served with distinction at the Battle of Sluys eight years later-although , he thought with an edge of mordant humor even now , if I 'd learned a bit more then of ships , I might have been wise enough to stay home this time ! - and slogged through the bitterly disappointing French campaign of 1340 . And a man who had returned with a fortune from Henry of Denby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of good it 's done me in the end , he thought bitterly , remembering his gleaming plans . At thirty-five , he was at the height of his prowess , a hard bitten , professional master of the soldier 's trade . A knight , yes , but the grandson of a commoner who had won both knighthood and barony the hard way and himself a man who knew the reality of war , not the minstrels ' tales of romance and chivalry . A man who fought to win ... and understood the enormous changes England and her lethal longbows were about to introduce into the continental princes ' understanding of the art of war . And one who knew there were fortunes to be made , lands and power to be won , in the service of his King against Philip of France . Despite the disappointments of 1340 , last year had proved Edward III his grandfather 's grandson , a welcome relief after the weakness and self indulgence of his father . Longshanks would have approved of the King , Sir George thought now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way and he 's chosen to beard Philip alone , the lions of England will make the French howl ! Perhaps they would , and certainly Edward 's claim to the throne of France was better than Philip VI 's , but Sir George Wincaster would not win the additional renown , or the added wealth and power he had planned to pass to his son , at his King 's side . Not now . For he and all the troops under his command would find another fate , and no one would ever know where and when they actually perished . * * * The corpse light of storm-wracked afternoon slid towards evening , and Sir George realized dully that they had somehow survived another day . He was too exhausted even to feel surprised ... and though he tried to feel grateful , at least , a part of him was anything but . Another night of horror and fear , exhaustion and desperate struggle , loomed , and even as he gathered himself to face it , that traitor part wanted only for it to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there would be rest enough soon enough , he reminded himself . An eternity of it , if he was fortunate enough to avoid Hell . He hoped he would be , but he was also a realist-and a soldier . And Heaven knew that even the best of soldiers would face an arduous stay in Purgatory , while the worst ... He brushed the thought aside , not without the wistful wish that he and Father Timothy might have argued it out one more time , and made himself peer about . The second ship was still with them , farther away as darkness gathered , but still fighting its way across the heaving gray waste , and he could actually see a third vessel beyond it . There might even be one or two more beyond the range of his sight , but-Sir George 's stumbling , exhaustion-sodden thoughts jerked to a stop , and his hand tightened like a claw on the stay . A cracked voice screamed something , barely audible over the roar of wind and sea yet touched with a fresh and different terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matching fear as the shape burst abruptly and impossibly through the savage backdrop of cloud and rain . He could n't grasp it , at first . Could n't wrap his mind about it or find any point of reference by which to measure or evaluate it . It was too huge , too alien ... too impossible . It could not exist , not in a world of mortals , yet it loomed above them , motionless , shrugging aside the fury of the gale as if it were but the gentlest of zephyrs . Gleaming like polished bronze , flickering with the reflected glare of lightning , a mile and more in length , a thing of subtle curves and gleaming flanks caparisoned in jewel-like lights of red and white and amber . He stared at it , too amazed and astonished to think , the terror of the storm , even his fear for his wife and son , banished by sheer , disbelieving shock as that vast shape hung against the seething cloud and rain . And then it began to move . Not quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled wrath . It drifted over the more distant of the cogs he 'd seen earlier , and more light appeared as portions of its skin shifted and changed . No , they 're not " changing , " Sir George thought numbly . They 're opening . And those lights are coming from inside whatever it is . Those are doors , doors to chambers filled with light and-His thoughts stuttered and halted yet again as more shapes appeared , far smaller this time , but with that same unnatural stillness as the storm howled about them . Some were cross shaped , with the grace of a gliding gull or albatross , while others were squat cones or even spheres , but all were of the same bronze hue as the huger shape which had spawned them . They spread out , surrounding the half-foundered cog , and then- " Sweet Jesu ! " Sir George turned his head , too shocked by the lies of his own eyes to wonder how Father Timothy had suddenly appeared there . The snowy-haired Dominican was a big man , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard God 's call decades before , and Sir George released his death grip on the stay to fasten fingers of iron on his confessor 's arm . " In the name of God , Timothy ! What is that thing ? ! " " I do n't know , " the priest replied honestly . " But- " His voice chopped off abruptly , and he released his own clutch on the cog 's rail to cross himself urgently . Nor did Sir George blame him . " Holy Mary , Mother of God , " the baron whispered , releasing Father Timothy and crossing himself more slowly , almost absently , as an unearthly glare of light leapt out from the shapes which had encircled the other ship . Leapt out , touched the heaving vessel , embraced it ... ... and lifted it bodily from the boiling sea . Someone aboard Sir George 's own vessel was gibbering , gobbling out fragments of prayer punctuated by curses of horrified denial , but the baron himself stood silent , unable to tear his eyes from the impossible sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draining straight down from its half-flooded hold as if in a dead calm , only to be whipped to flying spray by the fury of the wind as they neared the sea below . Yet the shapes enfolded the cog in their brilliance , raising it effortlessly towards the far vaster shape which had birthed them , and he winced as someone aboard that rising vessel , no doubt maddened by terror , hurled himself bodily over the rail . Another body followed , and a third . " Fools ! " Father Timothy bellowed . " Dolts ! Imbeciles ! God Himself has offered them life , and they- ! " The priest broke off , pounding the rail with a huge , gnarly fist . The first plunging body struck the water and vanished without a trace , but not the second or third . Additional shafts of light speared out , touched each falling form , and arrested its deadly fall . The light lifted them once more , along with the cog , bearing them towards those brilliantly lit portals , and Sir George swallowed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 'd been wrong . It was longer than that . Much longer , for the cog 's hull finally gave him something against which to measure it , and the cog was less than a child 's toy beside the vast , gleaming immensity that rode like a mountain peak of bronze amidst the black-bellied clouds of the gale 's fury . " Were they fools ? " He did n't realize he 'd spoken-certainly not that he 'd spoken loudly enough for Father Timothy to hear through the crash of the sea and the wind-shriek , but the priest turned to him once more and raised an eyebrow . Even here and now , the expression brought back memories of the days when Father Timothy had been Sir George 's tutor as he was now Edward 's , but this was no time to be thinking of that . " Were they fools ? " Sir George repeated , shouting against the storm 's noise . " Are you so certain that that ... Continues ...            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
