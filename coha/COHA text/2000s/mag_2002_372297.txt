GOOD NEWS <P> BONING UP It was big news 16 months ago when drugmakers announced that the powerful osteoporosis medicine Fosamax could be taken once a week instead of once a day . Once a year is even better , and early reports suggest that a yearly , five-minute IV infusion of a relative of Fosamax , called Zometa , may increase bone density of the spine by 5% and of the hip by 3% . So far Zometa does n't seem to have the side effects of Fosamax , which include abdominal pain and nausea . However , 10% of patients may experience flulike symptoms for a couple of hours after treatment . <P> CANCER BUSTER Just last year the breakthrough drug Gleevec looked so promising for treating a rare form of cancer called chronic myeloid leukemia that it received FDA approval in a record 2 1/2 months . Now it seems Gleevec may be even more effective than first thought . A study shows that after two years on the drug , 95% of patients are still alive , with 40% in complete remission . Treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pills may have to be taken for life . But we have n't heard the last of Gleevec . It 's being tested on breast , stomach and other common cancers . <P> BAD NEWS <P> PRESSURE COOKER Think you 'll never develop high blood pressure ? Do n't be so sure . A new study shows that a staggering 90% of middle-aged Americans will become hypertensive sometime in their lives . How do you reduce your risk ? The usual ways : exercise , stay slim and avoid excessive fat , alcohol and salt . <P>  --  By Janice M.
