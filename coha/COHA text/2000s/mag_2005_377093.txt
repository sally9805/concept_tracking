We live in a shortsighted society that sees sleep as an obstacle to productivity Dec. 20 . But the truth is quite the opposite . A nightly investment in eight hours of rest may lead to even greater accomplishments . The greatest and most imaginative members of society , our children , sleep 10 to 12 hours a night . We should follow their lead . And we certainly should n't buy into romanticized notions of how much work we can do without sleep . <P> LEWIS J. KASS , M.D. , DIRECTOR PEDIATRIC SLEEP LABORATORY THE CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL AT MONTEFIORE New York City <P> Going without rest is a disturbing American trend , like overachieving . But sleep deprivation will catch up with us in the end . Falling asleep at the wheel because of lack of sleep has killed innocent drivers . Why do we feel the need to be constantly doing something ? To pump up our self-esteem ? I 'm with William Shakespeare , who referred to " sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care . " <P> ROBIN FRANCIS Grosse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of sleep was fascinating , but I wish there had been some information for the benefit of millions of insomniacs like me , whose only desire is to drop off . <P> JIM HOLIK Denver <P> You reported that scientists have found that going without sleep for more than 20 hours significantly impairs a person 's cognitive abilities and reaction time , producing a functional level as bad as if he had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.08 . Perhaps these scientists should talk to their colleagues who run medical-residency programs that require 24-to-36-hour shifts . Sleep deprivation might contribute to medical mistakes , leading to malpractice lawsuits and higher malpractice insurance costs , which drive some doctors to stop practicing . <P> JONG-ON HAHM Potomac , Md . <P> Instead of asking why we sleep , it might make sense to ask why we wake . Perchance we live to dream . From that perspective , the sea of troubles we navigate in the workaday world might be the price we pay for admission to another night in the world of dreams . <P> RICHARD GREENE San Rafael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter helped Army Specialist Thomas Wilson craft the question he asked Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld about U.S. troops having inadequately armored vehicles Dec. 20 . That should in no way detract from the seriousness of the shortages and the problems that our troops are facing in combat in Iraq . It does not make Rumsfeld 's answer  --  " You go to war with the Army you have "  --  less callous or arrogant . And it certainly does not make the deaths and horrific injuries suffered by our troops less real or less painful to bear because they lack such protection . <P> DORIAN DE WIND MAJOR , U.S.A.F.
