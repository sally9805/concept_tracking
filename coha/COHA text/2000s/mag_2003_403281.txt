Elation is what you feel when you first discover a good tool , and table saws certainly are good tools . In March 1982 , I switched off my first table saw and , as the blade spun to a halt , I could n't have been happier . Table saws allow you to cut all kinds of lumber and plywood with great accuracy , safety and ease . I 've owned three over the last 20 years , and used a half-dozen other machines while working professionally as a cabinetmaker and carpenter . STRAIGHT , TRUE AND SQUARE If you 're planning to build or remodel your home , make furniture or cabinets , or maybe begin a small-scale woodworking venture , you should consider making a table saw your first major tool purchase . Table saws are extremely useful because they create straight , smooth and accurate cuts in lumber , wood-based sheet materials and even some types of plastic . Radial arm table saws , which have the saw mounted above instead of underneath the table , make straight cuts , too , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Table saws ( sometimes called bench saws ) have three main parts : a horizontal table that supports wood during use ; a circular saw blade that extends up through a slot in the table ; and a rip fence that guides the wood over the spinning blade ( see illustration on Page 83 ) .

This means that table saw results are more accurate than anything you can conveniently produce with a hand-held circular saw . And while accuracy has been a hallmark of stationary table saws , the midrange , portable table saws have become more versatile , powerful and safer in the last 10 years . A wide range of sizes are available , from small , ultra-lightweight models costing less than $100 , to heavy-duty , nonportable cabinet saws that weigh 500 pounds . Differences in quality , size and design mean that some table saw models perform better than others on a variety of tasks . The trick , as is usually the case , is " separating the wheat from the chaff " when you prepare to tool-up with a handy table saw . BUY QUALITY Buying tools that are too small or underpowered for the job is a common mistake . This is especially a concern when selecting a table saw because of the proliferation of small , inexpensive saws ( less than $100 and 50 pounds ) . Typical cheap-saw problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small work surfaces . These limitations lead to short-lived saw performance : Either the saw breaks or you get tired and frustrated with pushing a ma-chine beyond its design capacity . Small table saws generally are not as safe to use as larger saws . Plan to spend at least $250 for a quality saw . WHICH KIND ? If you have n't yet realized that there 's never enough room in a workshop , you probably will someday . That 's why a portable saw is ideal in many situations . It frees up floor space between uses and al-lows you to take cutting capabilities on the road . Many companies now offer excellent , professional-grade table saws ( weighing from 75 to 150 pounds ) that are fairly affordable . The issue of size and weight brings you to the first pre-purchase question : Will your saw be used most frequently in a workshop , or will it always be on the move to different areas of building activity ? If stationary use will be the norm , con-sider buying a heavyweight , contractor table saw . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They weigh about 100 to 150 pounds , include cast-iron work surfaces and offer a heft that ensures a stable work platform . The latest breed of contractor saws do a great job with routine homestead projects and fine woodworking . A growing number of models include the same kind of rip fence and work surface normally found on the best 500-pound , stationary , cabinetmaker table saws . For the nomad sawyer , working in the shop one day , in the back yard the next , and at a buddy 's place on the weekend , a lightweight , bench-top table saw is an ideal choice . These smaller contractor saws are designed to operate on top of an existing bench or the tailgate of your pickup . Typically weighing in at about 75 pounds , bench-top saws pack a lot of cutting power into a compact machine , and that 's their biggest virtue . PERFORMANCE Do n't let their small size confuse you . Although high quality bench-top table saws look similar to those cheap models destined to disappoint , they are different . And price is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Choose a saw with a 10-inch-diameter blade , a sliding guide ( called a " fence " ) that 's capable of guiding cuts to the center of a 48-inch-wide sheet of plywood or particleboard , and enough power to handle a full range of cutting challenges . Saws with motors drawing 12 to 15 amps of current , and spinning a full-size , 10-inch blade offer the zest to slice through 2-inch-thick hardwood in a single pass . Optional accessories worth considering are a folding support stand , enhanced cutting jigs and fixtures . DUST CONTROL Most wood gives off a pleasant aroma when it 's cut , but wood dust is more than just fragrant - it 's also hazardous to your health . Invisible , ultrafine dust particles generated by power tools like table saws are especially hazardous . Unless you 're using a table saw outdoors , you need some kind of dust control or personal dust protection . At a minimum , don a dust mask in addition to the eye and ear protection you need to operate a table saw safely . A mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get coated in fine dust . To avoid this , you need some additional equipment . Manufacturers sell dust collection bags that attach directly to the table saw . As the wood is cut , the heaviest sawdust is sucked down into the small bag . // For more extensive dust collection , a wet/dry vacuum that moves 175 to 200 cubic feet per minute ( cfm ) of air with a 2 1/2-inch outlet is a relatively inexpensive , compact and portable option . It will capture most but not all of the fine particles . That 's why manufacturers offer wholeshop dust filters that purify ambient air . The filter sits in a box attached to the ceiling . A small fan moves the shop air through the filter , capturing the smaller dust particles . Choose a filter rated to remove dust particles as small as 0.5 microns . A whole-shop filter that moves 600 to 800 cfm of air is ideal for most workshops . The ultimate dust device attaches directly to the saw . It uses a 1- or 2-horsepower motor , and gathers and filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Select a unit with a filter bag made of felt . ( Thin cloth bags allow a lot of fine dust to escape and could make the dust hazard even worse by broadcasting the contamination . ) For more information , read Woodshop Dust Control by Sandor Nagyszalanczy . TOOLS FOR SELF-RELIANCE On June 23 , 1891 , a man named Ernest Taylor was the first person to sign his name on a deed to the 100-acre parcel of land that is my farm today . He settled with his family , cleared fields and began a relationship with the land that 's now mine to preserve and enhance . Every so often I find evidence of the tools associated with the relationship started by Ernest Taylor : a bit of old chain ; a rusted horseshoe turned up in the middle of a field ; a remnant of horsedrawn machinery . Regardless of time or place , self-reliance depends on the same three things : know-how , initiative and tools . Implements of self-reliance might look a little different in the 21st century , but despite power cords , fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same lofty goal . Photograph Sidebar Blade Basics Many otherwise great saws come from the factory with second-rate blades . Part of your commitment to getting excellent table-saw performance means buying a high quality , carbide blade that 's designed for the work you intend to do . Any blade worth owning includes small blocks of extra-hard carbide metal that form the cutting teeth around the blade 's circumference . These wear-resistant carbide blades outperform older all-steel equivalents by more than 10 to 1 . For general cutting of solid wood , along ( ripping ) and across ( cross-cutting ) the grain , plus some rough cutting in plywood , select a combination blade ( shown in the middle , at left ) . Typical 10-inch-diameter combination designs have 50 teeth around the edge of the blade , gathered in groups of five , with a large space between each group to accommodate sawdust . Heavy cutting of solid wood along the grain is best done with a dedicated ripping blade ( shown on top ) . These include a couple of dozen coarse teeth arranged evenly around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each tooth . Fine cutting of veneered plywood , melamine-coated particleboard and thin sheet materials is best done with an extra-fine blade ( shown on the bottom ) , sold exclusively for the job . Blades of this sort usually have 80 teeth evenly spaced around the 10-inch-diameter disc . All carbide blades can be resharpened professionally , yielding an extremely long working life . Buy anti-kickback blades whenever you can . " Kickback " describes a sudden and dangerous event where the blade grabs the work piece and hurls it back at the table saw operator . The anti-kickback blade design includes a small ridge of metal in front of each tooth ( or each group of teeth in the case of a combination blade ) . These ridges limit the amount of wood each tooth can bite off , yielding much safer operation . Anti-kickback designs do n't interfere with normal saw-blade action or performance ; they just reduce the chances that a work piece will be caught and flung back at you by the blade . // <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
