<p> This so-called rare cancer is on the rise , striking one of the most vulnerable spots on a man 's body . Here 's how to tell if you 're at risk and how to look for its early warning signs <p> For Bruce Wilson , the trouble started during a ball game . When the O'Fallon , MO , engineer felt a pain in his scrotum , he thought maybe he 'd hurt himself playing softball . His doctor diagnosed the problem as an infection . Wilson took some antibiotics and seemed to get better . But he still noticed some discomfort off and on . Months passed . <p> Almost a year later , Wilson was still having problems , only now one of his testicles was enlarged . This time his doctor ordered an ultrasound . The scan revealed a growth on his enlarged testicle . The diagnosis : testicular cancer . <p> " Up until that time , I 'd never examined myself for signs of testicular cancer . In fact , I ca n't recall even hearing about testicular cancer before then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's likely he would have viewed it in the same dismissive light in which many doctors and health care professionals regard it : as a rare cancer that strikes only young men . <p> It 's true that testicular cancer is the most common cancer among men ages 15 to 40 . But it 's also true that testicular cancer can and does strike at any age : Bruce Wilson was 47 when he got his diagnosis . The Earlier , the Better <p> Overall , testicular cancer may be rare , accounting for only 1% of all cancers in men and about 300 deaths last year . It also has an estimated 5-year survival rate of 95% . ( Three years after his initial diagnosis , Bruce Wilson is cancer-free and likely to remain so . ) <p> But as curable as it is , more men are getting it ; over the past 50 years , the number of cases per year has doubled . And studies suggest it 's not being caught as early as it could be . <p> In one review of testicular cancer diagnoses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and army colonel at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , DC , found that men with cancer symptoms may wait as long as 6 months before seeing their doctor . That 's plenty of time for the more aggressive forms of testicular cancer to spread to the abdomen , the lungs , and even the brain . <p> What 's worse , many family physicians who seldom see a case of testicular cancer in their practice misdiagnose the problem as a simple infection , allowing the cancer to grow unchecked . <p> " Obviously , the cure rate improves most dramatically the earlier the cancer is caught , " says Eric A. Klein , MD , head of the section of urologic oncology at the Urological Institute of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio . But Dr. Klein says that most men still do n't know nearly enough about testicular cancer risks , or about a simple self-test that could spot the danger signs of testicular cancer long before it becomes life threatening . What 's Your Risk ? <p> Although there are effective ways of treating testicular cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its causes . " We ca n't really link it to specific habits or environmental influences , the way we can with some other cancers , " says Dr. Moul . But there are factors that may raise a man 's risk of testicular cancer . <p> Undescended testicle . Some boys are born with cryptorchidism , medical parlance for an undescended testicle . " In many cases , the testicle eventually descends as you get older , but surgery may be required to descend it or sometimes remove it , " says Dr. Klein . If you had an undescended testicle , your risk for testicular cancer is at least three times higher than that of other men . <p> Family history . If your father or a brother had testicular cancer , your risk of developing it could be as much as 10 times higher than that of men with no family history . <p> Racial background . In general , Caucasian men have a higher risk of developing this cancer than men of other racial backgrounds . For example , Caucasians have a fourfold greater risk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the men diagnosed with testicular cancer do turn out to have fertility problems . If you have a history of fertility problems , this does n't mean you 're at greater risk of developing testicular cancer , says Dr. Moul . But it 's one more reason to remain vigilant about cancer signs . <p> But not injury . At one time , doctors believed that trauma to the testicles increased the risk of developing cancer . " A guy would take a hit , then he 'd notice something was wrong . Or the pain might take him to the doctor , who would notice an abnormality , " explains Dr. Moul . " But in fact , what was probably happening was that the injury only brought attention to a cancer that was already present . More recent studies have not shown any real link between injuring your testicles at any point in your life and increasing your risk of developing cancer from that injury . Bicycling or horseback riding also does not increase your risk . Taking a shot to the groin does not increase your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are n't yet any specific guidelines for reducing your risk of developing testicular cancer , there are some steps you can take to catch it early . <p> Listen to her . Dr. Moul says in many cases , men see their doctor because their wife or girlfriend insisted they make an appointment . In many cases , it was the woman who detected the abnormality . <p> Stay informed . Although testicular cancer does n't get a lot of press , there are some sources you can use to stay up-to-date . One of the best is the Testicular Cancer Resource Center , an Internet site run by testicular cancer survivors ( www.acor.org/tcrc ) . In addition to hard-core medical information , the site also has support areas and survivor stories . Some nonprofit organizations , such as the Cancer Alliance for Research , Education , and Survivorship ( C.A.R.E.S. ) founded by champion skater and testicular cancer survivor Scott Hamilton ( www.scottcares.com ) ( see " Off Thin Ice " at right ) , or Cycle of Hope , Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong 's cancer-awareness campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 717-4673 for information on Cycle of Hope , or ( 800 ) 440-4140 , ext. 52573 for C.A.R.E.S. , or go to www.cycleofhope.com . <p> And most important : Do the test . " If men were performing regular monthly testicular self-exams ( TSE ) much the same way women have been encouraged to perform self-exams for breast cancer , there would be a much higher awareness level of testicular cancer and faster treatment with fewer risks of side effects and complications , " says Dr. Klein . " There are experts in this field who do n't think men should be doing TSEs . Their view is that regular self-exams would lead to a lot of anxiety and false alarms . I would much rather see my doctor and find out nothing 's wrong than miss spotting a cancer that could have been diagnosed early and treated decisively . " <p> Moreover , Dr. Klein says , as men perform TSEs regularly , they 'll learn what the various structures in the scrotum feel like and , therefore , be more likely to spot abnormalities . While it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , read " Getting to Know You : Doing the TSE " at left to get started before your next appointment . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Stephen C. George , edits our columns every month ness editor <p> IS IT CANCER ? <p> If you perform a regular monthly testicular self-exam , you may notice a lump , bump , or other irregularity . That does n't mean it 's cancer , but it could be one of these common testicular problems : <p> Epididymitis : An infection that causes pain and swelling of the epididymis , the tubal structure that carries sperm from the testicle . Antibiotics can clear up the problem , but if symptoms continue after 2 weeks or come back after you 've finished the antibiotics , see your doctor immediately . <p> Hernia : A tear in the muscle wall of your abdomen can cause part of your intestines to protrude into your scrotum . If you feel a mass in your scrotum , especially one accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may need immediate surgical treatment . <p> Hydrocele : This collection of fluid around the testicle can develop as a result of injury or infection and is more common in older men . Symptoms include a painless but obvious swelling as well as a sense of heaviness in the scrotum . Although often harmless and easily treated , hydrocele can be a sign of testicular cancer , so call your doctor if you detect one . <p> Spermatocele : This painless cyst , composed of dead sperm , sometimes develops near the testicle , but not on or in it . While your doctor should check it out , it 's harmless and does n't usually require any treatment . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> OFF THIN ICE Scott Hamilton is no stranger to challenges where his career or health are concerned <p> As a child , the champion ice skater developed a mysterious , life-threatening illness in which his body absorbed very little nutrition from the food he ate , causing him to stop growing . He credits his discovery , at age 9 , of figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , " he says . <p> While an athlete of Hamilton 's caliber might be expected to be more in tune with his body , his competitive nature caused him to ignore a serious problem when he was 39 . " I had pain in my stomach . It reached a point where I could n't stand up . I thought I had an ulcer , " he recalls . What he had was a mass growing in his abdomen ; it had spread from an unchecked case of testicular cancer . <p> Hamilton sought care in his home state of Ohio at the Cleveland Clinic . And while he faced his treatment and chemotherapy with as much grace and poise as he 'd shown at countless competitive trials , even the irrepressible skater had to admit to some trepidation . <p> " But most of that was based on ignorance , " he admits . " I knew virtually nothing about testicular cancer or how it was treated . When they told me I needed chemotherapy , I thought I was going to have all my bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Hamilton did more than survive : He became an icon of hope to countless men afflicted with testicular cancer . Within a year , Hamilton was back on the ice , doing his usual show-stopping performances . But his experience made him realize a need among men coping with testicular cancer for more information , better sharing of knowledge , and support from survivors . <p> So he founded the Scott Hamilton C.A.R.E.S . ( Cancer Alliance for Research , Education , and Survivorship ) Initiative , which strives to provide a better atmosphere of knowledge and support for people coping with all types of cancer . <p> One of the hallmarks of the program is its support function , in which men coping with cancer treatment get paired with survivors . <p> " It helps you to know there 's someone out there who went through it , who can share your fears but also give you an idea of what to expect . Treatment may not be a picnic , but somehow , knowing what 's coming makes you stronger , helps you face it head-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule ( he just finished his farewell tour in " Stars on Ice " and also hosts the Circle of Friends benefit golf tournament ) , Hamilton still tries to participate in the program as a survivor whenever he can . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Scott Hamilton missed the danger signs-until it was almost too late . <p> GETTING TO KNOW YOU : DOING THE TSE <p> Start by taking a warm bath or shower . Heat relaxes the scrotum , making it easier to examine the testicles . Stand in front of a mirror . Then look for swelling on the skin of the scrotum . <p> If you 've never performed a TSE , take a moment to find the epididymis ; it 's the tube-like structure behind the testicle that carries sperm . It 's a good idea to know what your epididymis feels like so you wo n't mistake it for a lump or mass . <p> Now , check each testicle with both hands . Put your index and middle fingers under the testicle , and place both thumbs on top . Slowly roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some signs to be aware of : Any kind of lump on or in the testicle . Most lumps are found on the side , but some appear on the front of the testicle too . While it 's normal for one testicle to be larger than the other , watch out for any change in size of either testicle , which you should be able to spot if you perform a TSE every month . A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum . Any pain or discomfort in either testicle or scrotum , or a dull ache in your groin area . Enlargement and/or tenderness of the breast area could also be signs related to testicular cancer . <p> If you spot any of these signs , see your doctor right away . It may be nothing at all , but it 's better to know for sure . <p>
