Albert Cowdrey knows a bit about how diplomacy works - he used to head the Conventional War Studies Branch at the US Army Center of Military History in Washington , DC . His new story shows that in addition to understanding diplomacy , he also has a keen understanding of how thing work throughout the galaxies and a gift for spinning out stories . <p> BLAZING IN THE GOLD UNIFORM of UNIDIP - the Universal Diplomatic Service - Vincent Khartoum emerged onto the pad of Malakatha 's ugly little shuttleport . A ragged serfboy followed , sweating under a small hillock of luggage . Lined up at ramrod attention , an honor guard of gleaming hots presented nine-point-four impact weapons as Vincent lumbered past , pushing his broad bemedaled frontage before him like a galleon 's prow . At the end of the file an armored limousine opened its multi-leaved passenger door like an unfolding chrysanthemum . Vincent threw back his head and stared down his nose , a trick that made him seem even taller than his two-meters-one . " Why , " he demanded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal flyer with guardian drones that is my due ? " He spoke in a degenerate dialect called Low Vexish , the common language of Malakatha . In reply the driver - a black box - buzzed , " A temporary halt to air traffic has been ordered since a traitor attempted to bomb His Supremacy 's palace . " " Why does n't he get rid of his rebels , eh ? " " He will do so almost immediately . They are but a few malcontents . He will erase them with his frown . Most Honored Sir , pray honor this wretched slave by entering . We have before us a lengthy drive to the Zot . " Puffing and grumbling , Vincent did so . Like his gut , his rump was impressive , and took some time to settle among the purple faux-velour cushions . At last the massive door closed , and the motor purred into activity . As the car began to move , he was thinking : The Zot , the Zot - what did my infopacket say about the Zot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshland inhabited by giant leeches , carnivorous glongbars , poison-footed blids , and King Drax . Why the monarch chose to hide from his subjects in the middle of a primeval swamp became clear as the scenery of Malakatha unfolded . Roadside villages featured decaying huts , ragged peasants climbing around on garbage heaps , and impaled bodies gazing blindly at the sky like speared frogs . The fields grew crops only of gibbets and gallows , all occupied . The sole large buildings were prisons where bemedaled officers saluted the king 's limo while grim-looking guards presented arms and chain gangs prostrated themselves . Viewing the wretched scene , Vincent found himself thinking : Good Lord - this place is worse than Peoria ! Though he concealed the fact as much as possible , he had indeed been born in Peoria , a big ramshackle city set like a navel ring in the middle of the Dark Continent of North America . After the second-to-last war had erased all the Earth 's capitals , places previously of little importance became vast centers of population : Sarajevo ; Minsk ; Moosejaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-six years ago to poor , hard-working parents who , along with 32,691 others , inhabited a huge tenement called the Peoria Honeycomb . Urine-fouled hallways , air shafts piled with rubbish to the third story , and perpetual smells of cooking SAPS ( Stewed and Processed Scraps , the chief food of the poor ) made life in the Honeycomb anything but sweet . Amid these grim conditions the young Vincent had dreamed of freeing the oppressed . He disfigured his school notebooks with drawings of himself bearing a sword in one hand ( to liberate ) and a torch in the other ( to enlighten ) . In his high school 's senior play he took the part of Macduff and enacted the final sword fight so vigorously that the boy impersonating the tyrant Macbeth required plastic surgery . Then Vincent grew up . Like many another child of poverty , he embarked on a lifelong struggle to escape the company of the oppressed forever . On scholarship he entered the vast university center at Minsk , surviving the bitter Belarussian winters on a diet of SAPS and blini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Summa cum laude in History and Languages , copped a clerkship at UNIDIP , and moved to the lush African surroundings of New Great Zimbabwe , the Capital of All Humankind . There he mastered both human and alien tongues , from Amharic to Low Vexish to Xlu . He studied the mysteries of Protocol until he knew exactly why an Assistant Deputy outranked a Deputy Assistant . He attended seminars on Deception , where he learned how to promise everything and nothing in the same breath . He joined a debating society and practiced the tricks of Rhetoric - often called the " science of flimflam " - on every possible occasion . He found a patron in Maxim Balabanov , the Second Secretary , became an Area Specialist in Most Remote Space , and began to win promotions - first to Deputy Assistant , then to Assistant Deputy . By this time the idealistic schoolboy and the hard-working university student both had evaporated and been replaced by a portly , oldish young man noted for his glossy exterior and his profound ability to mask his true thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant Franco-Cambodian whose very name ( Marie-Elyse de Phnompenh ) exuded an antique elegance . The couple rented a palazzo on an alley off the Souk and entertained to the limit of Vincent 's now substantial salary . Many a formal dinner gave him increasing gravitas - about ninety-nine kilos of it - and his personality evolved in tandem with his physical presence . At home he lost interest in sex and became pompous , stuffy , and exasperating , and Marie responded by starting an affair with ( appropriately ) a charg d'affaires . But away from home , his career flourished . He joined the diplomatic team that negotiated an end to the First Allen War , exhibiting to great effect his mastery of Xlu - a very difficult tongue with only one vowel ( a sort of grunt , represented in textbooks by the letter u ) but six hundred consonants , some of which he needed a prosthesis to enunciate . His combination of fluency , adept lying , and the sheer intimidation of his size ( the average Xluan stood only 1.1 meters tall and weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfair advantages the human species reaped from the treaty . By this time Peoria had sunk far beneath Vincent 's mental horizon . He 'd entirely ceased to communicate with his parents , or even to acknowledge that he had any . Whenever their neighbors in the Honeycomb asked his father what had happened to Little Vince , the old man would spit and reply , " We du n no and we duhwanna know . " By 10275 of the Absolute Calendar ( which had replaced the mythbased calendars of the past ) Vincent Khartoum felt ready for an ambassadorship . Imagine his astonishment and chagrin when he learned that he was to be dispatched ( on a mere military transport ) to negotiate with the contemptible tyrant of Malakatha ! SECOND SECRETARY Balabanov was a grossly handsome man who wore a vast tawny wig like a lion 's mane . His lifestyle was extravagant , his mind devious . He liked to say that Baron Talleyrand ( Napoleon 's foreign minister , who betrayed everybody and profited handsomely thereby ) was the greatest man in history . Balabanov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some elderly Minister of State in order to take his place . He proclaimed over and over , to the point of tedium , that to succeed in life one had to plan ahead . Vincent found him both admirable ( the man knew how to climb the bureaucratic ladder ) and repugnant ( he was such a piece of #ulupu- ! pu , or " walking excrement " as a Xlu phrase pungently expressed it ) . After delivering the bad news about Vincent 's new appointment , Balabanov made an effort to butter up his subordinate . " You will , of course , go to Malakatha as Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary . " Plenipotentiary " means you 'll have full power , " he explained . " I 'm familiar with the term , " Vincent murmured , his face smooth and resolutely pleasant . Inwardly , he was raging . " It 's a nasty little rock , from all I 've heard , and King Drax is a foul sort of creature . Well , it takes all kinds to make a galaxy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your Excellency 's philosophical insight never ceases to astonish me . " " Save your brown-nosing for King Drax , " replied Balabanov severely . " You may need it . What he does on his own world is deplorable but no business of ours . However , we 've learned that he 's preparing a fleet of armed vessels to engage in piracy . What affects the spaceways - especially the exit of the trans-Aran wormhole , less than a microparsec from his lair - is our business . " " So I 'm to negotiate the liquidation of his fleet . What can I offer in return ? " " Subsidies to fifty trillion sols if he agrees - war if he does not . As I said : full power . We trust your competence absolutely . " After a moment 's thought he added , " Start by offering him forty and see what happens . And pick up a nice medal - say a Grand Order of the Plenum - from the heraldry office . If he 's a good swine , award it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you 've brought this business to a successful conclusion , I 've got a nice ambassadorship waiting for you . On a Xlu world , where your famous fluency can serve humanity best . " " Uu knu* ! ulthth uj zwuq , " Vincent replied with a bow , knowing well that Balabanov did n't understand a word of Xlu . Considering what he was inviting the second secretary to do , that was just as well . " You leave in fifteen days , " Balabanov finished . " You 'll start outprocessing at once . " Rising , he lifted one hand in farewell , declaring grandly , " Your return will be the signal for peace - or war . " As the door to Balabanov 's palatial office whispered shut behind him , Vincent was wondering : Why do n't I believe him ? Out-processing meant a tedious trek from one division of UNIDIP to another , getting his records checked and cleared in case he perished by some mishap in Deep Space . He encountered all the usual annoyances . The Bursar found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his budget had been disallowed . The Chief Librarian at Infocenter charged him eleven lunes fine for failing to return a virtual-reality game called Sex All Possible Ways that he certainly had n't charged out . In Medcheck , bots zapped him with sixteen different injections , leaving his shoulders and upper arms black and blue . " The disease environment of Malakatha is really quite exciting , " enthused the Chief Medical Officer , who then ordered an incipient hernia corrected even though Vincent protested that he felt fine . For minor surgery , the operation was quite sufficiently annoying . The wound was glued , of course , so that Vincent had no stitches or staples to be removed , as in the dark ages of medicine . Still , he had to take painkillers for a week , and his tailor had to let out his uniforms in the waist and crotch before he again felt comfortable in them . While waiting , he visited the Heraldry Office and picked up a Grand Order of the Plenum . The medal was the size of a soup plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so big and hung so low on the recipient that it was known unofficially as " the ninny protector . " " It 's exactly the sort of thing the little toad ought to find irresistible , " said the Chief of Heraldry . " Just do n't break the plastic envelope until you 're ready for the presentation . The gold 's only two microns thick , and it 'll rub off if you look at it . " " In short , " groused Vincent , " I 'm to cross Deep Space to present a fake medal to a sleazy tyrant as a reward for accepting an enormous bribe not to become a pirate . " " That 's diplomacy , " shrugged the Chief of Heraldry . Vincent 's mood was not improved by his wife 's obvious eagerness to see him go . " I 'll help you pack , " was the limit of Marie-Elyse 's concern . " Do you realize that I 'm being sent to a miserable backwoods planet ruled by a homicidal maniac ? " Vincent demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , tossing his newly altered and ironed dress uniform all anyhow into a portmanteau . " Balabanov is very high on you . " " Balabanov is high only on Balabanov . I 'm suspicious of this whole business . There 's some deep , devious plot underway , I 'm sure of it . " " My dear , that 's the way things are at UNIDIP . It 's a bottle of scorpions , as you very well know . " " ' UNIDIP " is a very undignified slang expression , " Vincent intoned in his most pompous manner . " Even Balabanov uses it in unbuttoned moments , " Marie-Elyse replied , and Vincent was too concerned over the way she was wrinkling his dress uniform to wonder where she had seen Balabanov unbuttoned . Following an unsatisfactory departure , Vincent had to endure the crashing boredom of interstellar travel . Traversing the Trans-Aran Wormhole turned out to be rather like taking the subway from Peoria to Minsk . Against the ports pressed ebon nothingness - an updated version of the ancient satirist Mark Twain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on a hard bunk in his stateroom , brooded : To think that idiots used to call this mankind 's ultimate adventure ! The military unit traveling on the transport were replacements for the garrison guarding the wormhole 's exit . The commander tried to keep his people busy , setting up a dense schedule of Lectures , Hand-to-Hand Combat , Happy Hours , and Orgy Groups to fill the timeless time on shipboard . Vincent skipped most of these dubious pleasures , but did attend a lecture on New and Improved Weaponry . Here he learned about the wonderful progress being made in the technology of warfare : particlebeam generators , meson-bond disintegrators , and atomlasers were being deployed , along with a new munition called Obliterol that combined the convenience of plastic explosive with the punch of cold fusion . Sensing a bargaining chip in these fearsome weapons , Vincent hastily jotted the information down on the cuff of his left sleeve . And yet .... Back in his tiny stateroom , lying on his hard bunk , he found all his doubts about his mission returning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bribing Drax harder than ever to understand . Could n't the heavy cruisers protect the wormhole exit ? A king of France once commented that Paris was well worth a Mass . Was Malakatha-poor , dismal , remote , harried by a lunatic ruler-really worth fifty trillion or a war ? Baffled , Vincent signed out a machine and played over and over his memory cube on Malakatha . It did n't make pleasant listening . On that benighted planet , it seemed , the exquisite tedium of life was relieved only by the agonizing methods of inflicting death . " Torture is much cultivated as an art , a science , and a recreation , " the cube remarked with mechanical sang-froid . " The usual punishment for displeasing King Drax is to be boiled , boned , diced , and scattered . Simple impalement is customary for lesser offenses , such as failing to genuflect when his name is mentioned . " Beautiful . When at last the ship dropped out of the wormhole , Vincent was torn between relief that most of the journey lay behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship 's bridge behind the Celestial Navigator 's chair , he watched a binary star system emerge from the night like a pair of baleful eyes . A nearby pinpoint of light grew to a tiny crescent ; the crescent enlarged to the semblance of Luna . " Malakatha , " said the navigator , turning to him . " Have fun . " SO FAR HE was n't having much . The landscape of prisons and filthy villages ended at a barren shoreline where the limo rolled onto a seemingly endless causeway . To left and right , leaden water glimmered with the reflections of a large sun , a small sun , and an errant moon . As the journey stretched out interminably , Vincent tried to chat with the black box in order to polish up his Low Vexish . He found it hard going . " Malakatha is a place of exceptional beauty , " he began , with the veracity of a true diplomat . " Beauty is a highly subjective concept , " the box opined . " No doubt what some consider beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after lengthy meditation , " vice-versa . " Vincent tried again . " Am I correct in believing that the weather is somewhat warm for this time of year ? " " Warmth exists only with reference to cold , " mused the box . " Thus I am unable to reply to Your Excellency 's astute observation . " " King Drax has the reputation of being beloved by all the people of Malakatha . " " Men and women are , I believe , classed as animate beings . If we suppose that " animate " refers to organisms capable of irritability and reproduction , I am capable of neither ; therefore , in attempting to comment on the thoughts of such beings , my judgment would inevitably be skewed . " " My friend , you and not I should be the Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary . " " Alas , this modest and primitive device would be incapable of so exalted an endeavor . " Vincent gave up . The rest of the trip lasted either a standard hour or two weeks , depending on one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon , and a reedy landscape of muted colors surfaced like the iridescent carcass of a dead whale . The limo left the causeway and rolled down a highway of fused silicon pebbles between gloomy , vine-entangled trees . It passed through enormous fortified gates watched over by batteries of autocannon and past another execution ground decorated with more stakes and bodies , some of which were still twitching . At last - at very , very long last - the vehicle halted before King Drax 's palace . Emerging stiffly , Vincent gazed glumly at beetling towers , walls clad in bile-colored vine , enormous sealed and draped windows reflecting a sky filled with ecru clouds . The air had the greasy feel of marshland vapors everywhere , somehow chilly and oppressive at the same time . The oxygen level was tolerable , but a fractional increase in gravity did nothing to lighten his considerable weight . He was absorbing these sensations when coarse gravel crunched underfoot and a gleaming personage approached with stately stride either an expensive bot or a human bot-impersonator wearing chrome armor . " King Drax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Third Sun of the Planet Malakatha and Father of His People , bids you welcome . Pray allow this unworthy slave to direct you to your accommodations . " Vincent inclined his head very slightly and followed the unworthy slave up a mountainous stone staircase that had his unathletic lungs laboring long before he reached the top . He and his guide passed through a massive vaultlike door watched over by a grim-looking bot carrying the usual nine-point-four . The door had two electronic locks , and the majordomo produced one key , the guard the other . Behind them the door was doubly relocked , giving Vincent the feeling that he was being interred in King Drax 's private mausoleum . The feeling intensified as he trekked through kilometers of dim-lit hallways . On every wall the monarch appeared in holographic images as a near-angelic presence triumphing over the forces of evil . The pictures were activated by movement , humming with flashing swords and gasping dragons as Vincent and the majordomo passed by , then lapsing into immobility behind them . " King Drax hopes that his modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never in a hundred worlds have I been awed by such magnificence , " Vincent replied automatically . His mind was elsewhere . On Earth , Drax had appeared merely contemptible . Here at the center of his immense stone web he was an altogether more threatening figure . Vincent was beginning to wonder if he would leave this place alive . Was that what Balabanov was up to ? Getting King Drax to kill him , so that the Second Secretary could - could - could what ? At UNIDIP one usually assassinated one 's superior , in hopes of taking his place . What was the point of killing a subordinate ? For some reason the word " unbuttoned " drifted across Vincent 's mind , only to vanish into the limbo of inadmissible thoughts . " Your Excellency 's chamber , " intoned the majordomo , unlocking and throwing open another massive door . " One prays that its modesty does not grate upon your refined sensibilities . " Vincent stepped into a room so vast it could have been used as an arena for indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrison of the Trans-Aran Wormhole Exit could have scrubbed down . On a bed resembling a quilted grandstand his luggage awaited him , guarded by a valet bot . " His Majesty will greet you at Seventeen , " intoned the majordomo . The door closed , and was audibly locked twice . As the bot unpacked him , laying out his faux-silk undersuits , his lounging attire , his dress uniform - even flashier than the one he was wearing - Vincent found himself wondering if being boiled , boned , diced and scattered would hurt very much . He rather thought it would . Immaculate in his fanciest uniform , massive in his gravitas , a worthy representative of the government he served , Vincent followed with slow deliberate steps the gleaming majordomo into the King 's presence , silently repeating to himself the first thing he 'd learned at UNLDIP : the Diplomatic Decalogue . I. Never shall thou tell the truth , even as a last resort . II . Thou shalt trust no one . III . Never shalt thou concede a point without first gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which thou art not . V. Always shalt thou wear a face of marble , not of flesh . VI . When gazing at Defeat , thou shalt envision Victory . VII . When most helpless , thou shalt put on thy boldest front . VIII . Ever shalt thou make a major issue of minor points , so that by conceding them thou mayest gain that which thou dost really desire . IX . Ever shalt thou remember that whatever one side gains , the other side must lose . X. Never shalt thou forget that diplomacy is the continuation of war by other means . So true , he reflected . Ah , so true . The audience room was predictably enormous . The real non-digital tyrant of Malakatha sat at the far end of it - a small , ill-favored man with bloodshot eyes , a scraggly pointed beard , and large knobby hands and knees . He wore a scarlet cape many sizes too big for him and sat on a vast golden throne . To Vincent , Drax looked like a small , old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his father 's chair . Vincent bowed , and the king nodded infinitesimally . " I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE DOCUMENTS , " a voice boomed , startling as a crash of thunder from an empty sky . " GIVE THEM TO THE SLAVE . " For the first time Vincent realized that Drax was seated behind a shield of bullet-and-laser-proof transplast that bisected the room . His amplified voice issued from button-sized speakers that lined the crown moldings of the walls . Vincent gave up his documents and waited while the majordomo took the packet away , presumably to be tested for poison . After ten interminable minutes , it entered Drax 's end of the throne room through a gilded door and handed them over . While Drax was reading , it returned to the anteroom with a chair whose seat was studded with sharp golden tacks . " I prefer to stand , " said Vincent hastily . " King Drax desires you to sit , " said the majordomo . " Very few enjoy the privilege of sitting in his presence . " " His Supremacy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backside onto what was clearly one of the lesser implements in Drax 's arsenal of torments . " FORTY TRILLION ? ? " the thunder demanded . " THEY INSULT ME WITH AN OFFER OF FORTY TRILLION ? ? " Quite suddenly , and in spite of his fundamental discomfort , Vincent took a deep breath and relaxed . King Drax 's words were - as the celebrated revolutionary V. I. Lenin once had expressed it - the flash of lighting that illuminates reality . Vincent saw now that Drax had begun building his fleet , not to play the dangerous game of piracy , but in hopes of extracting a payoff to stop . So they could do business . And if Vincent became Drax 's means of getting a huge bribe , then his life would be ( relatively speaking ) safe . He reached another conclusion : for all his pretense of being Talleyrand , Balabanov was a fool . The second secretary was playing Drax 's game . Maybe he never would become First secretary after all . Naturally , Vincent 's face showed nothing of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mournful mien and intoned , " Alas , Your Supremacy , the expenses of the late alien war have rendered anything more a simple impossibility . " From that point on , the fencing followed a predictable path . Drax varied explicit threats against the Trans-Aran Wormhole with long , boring disquisitions on his own military genius . In return , Vincent invited Drax to contemplate the improved armament of the cruisers guarding the Wormhole . " No doubt Your Supremacy will sleep sounder , knowing that so powerful a friend is permanently stationed so ... very ... close . .. at hand . " He lingered over the final phrase like an organist fondling the bass key in a Bach fugue . Either Drax did n't understand or else possessed a true poker face , for the minuet of threat and counterthreat continued for another standard hour . Vincent 's bottom suffered accordingly , and yet he refused to be rushed . Not for nothing were senior negotiators awarded the enviable title of Culs de Pierre , or Stonebutts . With infinite reluctance he allowed Drax to bargain him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malakatha to check on the demolition of the fleet . " DO THE WRETCHED BUREAUCRATS OF UNIDIP NOT TRUST MY WORD ? " Drax thundered . " More than we trust the movement of the eternal stars , " Vincent replied avec suavit . " But the Senate of the Worlds will insist on inspection before they vote the money , so we might as well include it in the treaty now . Renegotiation , " he added , " would create so many uncertainties . " " YESSSSS , " exhaled Drax , and Vincent drew a deep breath , like a man on the rack who sees his tormentors preparing to knock off for lunch . " YOU WILL JOIN ME TONIGHT AT A FEAST CELEBRATING FRIENDSHIP , PEACE , AND LOVE , " the little monster roared . " AFTERWARD , WE WILL SIGN THE TREATY . " The majordomo reentered . Vincent rose stiffly , suffering new pangs as pinched-off blood vessels began to throb . As he left the antechamber on stiff limbs , the king was stroking his scraggly beard to hide a smile - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal Government out of fifty trillion sols . Back in his room , Vincent - disrobing with the aid of the valet bot discovered that every piece of clothing he wore was soaked with sweat , while the broad seat of his undersuit was additionally spotted with blood . As he entered the bathroom for a long hot soak he was muttering , " Wuk u ! nu'uun - kukl " Meaning in Xlu , " What a lousy day ! " THE FEAST OF FRIENDSHIP , Peace , and Love took place in a hall with floorspace enough for a small battle . At least Vincent 's new chair was comfortable . Little else in the room pleased him . The holographic wall images were in constant distracting motion , while on the floor the spotted skins of slaughtered blids and glongbars made crepitant noises whenever Vincent moved his feet . A creature resembling a feathered monkey sat on the back of Drax 's throne , gazing across the table at Vincent with garnet eyes . It , Drax , and Vincent were the only living creatures present . The thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversed in atonal voices while pretending to eat from empty plates . After tasting the food that emerged from His Supremacy 's kitchen , Vincent rather envied them . " It is my pleasure , " Drax remarked - minus his amplifiers , his voice was unpleasantly squeaky - " to begin each meal by recalling the fate of some former enemy . " He contemplated a cube of meat stuck on the end of his fork . " I remember this guy . A good , loyal servant . But he did n't love me - he obeyed me only because he had to . " He inserted the gobbet into his mouth and chewed slowly . " That was n't good enough . Matter of fact , it still is n't . " Drax turned his head and spat out the morsel . The feathered monkey leaped down and devoured it , then returned to its perch . The meal ground on , course after course after course of golden dishes filled with unidentifiable remnants of birds , beasts , and ( probably ) humans . ! Uuu dmu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope this meal is subtracted from my time in hell . " At last the table was cleared by busbots , and the majordomo spread out two copies of the draft treaty for signing . With a pen that emitted dry purple ink , Vincent changed " forty " to " fifty " and he and King Drax initialed the number . Then , as recorded trumpet blasts greeted their action , they signed the documents for the Universal Government and for Malakatha . The majordomo brought glasses of very tolerable wine , and Vincent and the king toasted each other again and again . Vincent 's toasts were fulsome , Drax 's condescending . Recorded trumpet blasts repeatedly drowned both of them out , so what they said probably did n't matter anyway . Then it was time to award the Grand Order of the Plenum . Opening the glittering box , Vincent broke the seal , peeled off the plastic envelope , and lifted out the medal , with its golden chain and jeweled catch , from the froth of faux silk where it lay . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture . " Give it to the slave , " he squeaked . The majordomo received the medal with its left hand and passed its right over it . Clearly , its palm contained a scanner . For a few long seconds the ceremony halted while it processed the information - very long seconds for Vincent , who suddenly realized that Balabanov , simply by having a dollop of poison or an explosive pellet embedded in the medal , could cause Drax to destroy him . " It is without foreign substances , O Sun of Our Lives and Our World , " intoned the flashy bot . Vincent took a quiet but deep breath . " Then give it to me , " cried Drax , suddenly greedy as a spoiled child eyeing a new toy . The majordomo circled the table , placed the golden chain around Drax 's neck , and snapped shut the jeweled catch . The flash that followed was visible from as far away as the shuttle port ; the bang would have rattled windows in a thousand peasant villages , if the peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towering walls of the palace dissolved into a dust storm , armies of shining bots into a barrage of molten metallic gobbets . Vast stores of munitions beneath the palace contributed a long series of secondary blasts to the initial thunder . The shattered ruins were quickly inundated by the waters of the Zot , and the surviving giant leeches , poison-footed blids , and carnivorous glongbars resumed their ancient sway over the interminable marshland . When the news from Malakatha reached Earth - Drax 's vaporization , the revolution that followed , the planet-wide carnival during which his torturers were each boiled , boned , diced , and scattered , to the cheers of the multitude - Balabanov and Marie-Elyse had a new topic for their pillow talk . " How clever of you , " she murmured , drowsy in the afterglow of lovemaking . Harsh African sunlight vibrated against carved fretwork screens , but did not penetrate the cool shadows of the private lair that Balabanov called his Lion Chamber . " To have thin sheets of this Obliterol stuff folded into Vince 's big belly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that great gross hairy egg of his had been made just for the purpose of holding a bomb . Where exactly did the surgeons put the stuff ? " " Between the greater and lesser omentum , " said Balabanov , " wherever that is . Also a microdetonator . " " And closing the catch on the medal sent the signal that touched off the explosion ! How very , very clever of you . I 'm sure after this coup you 'll be First secretary in no time . Hard on Vince , of course . " " I was sorry to lose the pompous oaf , " mused the second secretary . " I 've got nobody talks XIu half so well . But what was he , after all ? Just a rat from the Peoria slums . Well , by wiping out Drax he rid me of a nuisance and you of a husband . I reported that he sacrificed himself voluntarily , so in addition to his estate you 'll get a posthumous medal and his pension . " " Send the pension to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindled perhaps by the afterglow . " I believe they 're quite poor . After all , dearest , I have you . Send them the medal , too . I certainly do n't want the damn thing . " " I exist , " murmured Balabanov , taking a firm grip on Vincent 's widow 's thin and elegant body , " only to serve you . " And he did , too - over and over and over . In that as in so many other things , he resembled his hero Talleyrand . At first Vincent 's parents were not much grieved by the news of his demise . He 'd so thoroughly neglected them that his death seemed the end of somebody who was more than half a stranger . All that changed when they learned that he 'd blown himself up to free a whole world from the grip of a tyrant . Now they recalled the ideals of his childhood , his long-forgotten yearnings to liberate and uplift . Mrs. Khartoum found one of his school notebooks in some rubbish at the bottom of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband sat together , staring at a picture he 'd drawn of himself with sword and torch . " Imagine ! " whispered his mother , beginning to weep . " All that time . Working himself up at UNIDIP , getting himself sent to Mala-whatever , just so he could carry out his dream of liberating oppressed humanity ! " " And I used to think , " muttered Vincent 's father in an agony of contrition , " that he was such a - such a - well , you know . Turd . " When the pension ( fattened by Vincent 's hero bonus ) began arriving , they had another reason to bless him . At last they were able to move out of the Peoria Honeycomb and into a comfortable suburban villa , where at night the soft radioactive glow of Chicago illuminated the northern horizon . In their new home they set up a kind of altar in a corner of the living room , displaying Vincent 's portrait in his diplomatic uniform , along with his medal ( Hero of Humanity , Second Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his sacrifice . Their new neighbors were deeply impressed , - the Khartoums achieved high status and became quite boring as they recounted over and over ( with improvements ) words of wisdom that supposedly had issued from the mouth of the young Vincent . Of the years between his childhood and his death - since they knew practically nothing about them - they said little . " He wanted us to forget him , " sobbed his mother , " so that we would n't grieve when he died . But of course , we never did .
