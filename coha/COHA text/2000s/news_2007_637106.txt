<p> New York  --  In " Grey Gardens , " Little Edie Beale comes out in a long , upside-down skirt , torn pantyhose and a black kerchief on her head , advertising " The Revolutionary Costume for Today . " <p> " It ca n't be ordered from L.L. Bean . There 's more to living than Kelly green , " sings Jackie O 's eccentric cousin , who has been holed up for too long in a ramshackle Long Island mansion with her mother and 52 stray cats . <p> Scary and kind of wonderful , Little Edie might as well be singing about the revolutionary state of musical theater today . Neither beige nor prepackaged , the prime offerings of the 2006-07 season are among the most shocking and inventive in recent memory . <p> There 's nothing made to order about Duncan Sheik 's dark and propulsive " Spring Awakening , " a rock musical about teen sex , pregnancy , suicide and homosexuality . Nothing predictable about Atlanta native Alfred Uhry 's " LoveMusik , " a musical account of the tempestuous marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenya . Nothing comforting about the complex mirror image of Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter , Little Edie . <p> These three new musicals are likely to be at the front of the 2007 Tony Awards competition , which comes into focus as nominations are announced Tuesday . ( The honors will be handed out June 10 in a ceremony broadcast live on CBS . ) Along with solid revivals of musicals and plays , this year has been distinguished by a prolific crop of new dramas , many of which have opened in a last-minute rush to make the Tony deadline . Inside : A guide to the Broadway shows getting the buzz this year , K10 . <p> NEW MUSICALS <p> ' Spring Awakening ' <p> Based on German playwright Frank Wedekind 's 1891 classic , the teen-angst musical by Steven Sater ( book and lyrics ) and Duncan Sheik ( music ) is the freshest piece of musical theater literature since " Rent . " Were it not for its dark and erotic themes , copious use of profanity and songs about masturbation and child abuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulitzer Prize for drama ( it probably should have ) . <p> With songs that crawl deep under your skin exacerbated by the kinetic punk choreography of the peerless Bill T. Jones , the story of unleashed Aryan repression has the energy to peel the paint off the stately Eugene O'Neill Theatre . It opens with the image of a single girl ( Wendla , played by Lea Michele ) standing on a chair in her underwear . During their classroom lectures , the boys keep their microphones concealed under their jackets  --  sneaking lyrics when the professor ( Stephen Spinella , who plays all the adult male roles ) is not looking . Jonathan Groff 's handsome Melchior is the throbbing heart of the show : seducing Wendla and drawing explanatory sexual cartoons for Moritz ( John Gallagher Jr. ) , he 's ultimately ostracized to a corner . Looking like a blond Josh Hartnett , Jonathan B. Wright performs the big , um , stroking scene and later manages to get mild-mannered Ernst ( Gideon Glick ) to muster a kiss . For all its bleakness , " Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope and redemption . ( Eugene O'Neill Theater ) <p> ' Grey Gardens ' <p> Long before their squalid lives were turned into a cult documentary in 1975 , the Beales of East Hampton lived a swank life of garden parties , debutante balls , even a White House inauguration , thanks to cousin Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy . But as Little Edie says in the opening seconds of the musical , she was the girl who had everything  --  " but the ring . " Abandoned by her father ( and , she claimed , Joe Kennedy Jr. ) , young Edie could never escape the shadow of her domineering mother . Their heartbreaking ballad of co-dependency is the thread that keeps this campy account of social and mental decline on its emotional track . <p> That Little Edie ultimately turns out like her self-styled chanteuse of a mother is emphasized by the fact that diva suprema Christine Ebersole plays Big Edie in Act One and Little Edie in Act Two . Her transformation from elegant , white-gloved doyenne to deranged , turban-wearing old maid is a major Broadway achievement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson is not exactly chopped liver either , although her character bears the brunt of a little joke involving cat food and pate . Ever-competitive Big Edie also boils corn for their freeloading handyman , Jerry , and warbles about it in " Jerry Likes My Corn . " While Matt Cavenaugh 's take on Joe Kennedy 's Hyannisport manners feels tone deaf , it 's fun to see Little Jackie sitting at the knee of her grandfather ( John McMartin ) . But the piece de resistance is Little Edie , she of the screamingly mad fashion vocabulary and dilated sourpuss demeanor . ( Walter Kerr Theater ) <p> ' LoveMusik ' <p> Alfred Uhry will always be remembered for his Atlanta stories : " Driving Miss Daisy , " " The Last Night of Ballyhoo " and " Parade . " Now , in a collaboration with Harold Prince , the bard of Druid Hills has penned a valentine to German composer Kurt Weill and his odd-duckling wife , muse and lyrical interpreter , Lotte Lenya . Based on the couple 's love letters , " LoveMusik " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape a biography about the complicated relationship between the shy , halting Jewish man and his high-strung wife , the original Jenny in Weill and Bertolt Brecht 's revolutionary " Threepenny Opera . " <p> " LoveMusik " starts out like a chamber piece , intimate and spare , but by Act 2 , it becomes a procession of flashy , not always necessary song-and-dance numbers . If " LoveMusik " is a little clunky and uneven , it is endlessly , fascinatingly watchable , thanks to the sublime performances of Donna Murphy as Lenya and Michael Cerveris as Weill . Murphy captures the quirky Olive Oyl cadences of Lenya 's loopy , German-accented English , and she sings beautifully ( " Speak Low , " " Alabama Song " ) . Cerveris  --  done up in Weill 's square suits , wire-rim glasses and receding hairline  --  looks oddly like the dorky genius and pulls off the difficult task of making this vulnerable , bottled-up man come alive . Influenced by the concept musicals that Weill invented , " LoveMusik " is the only thing of its kind on Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> NEW PLAYS <p> ' Coram Boy ' <p> People have been scratching their heads over this spectacle from the National Theatre of Great Britain , which boasts an orchestra of seven , a 20-member choir and a cast of 40 . Is it a play or a musical ? In truth , " Coram Boy " is an ornately gilded sample cabinet of Handel 's Baroque music and Dickens-inspired Gothic storytelling . While an organ blares and harpsichords tinkle , babies are buried alive , a mentally deficient boy plays out his obsession with an angel , and a rich , impatient father disinherits his eldest son for being so passionate about music . Directed by Melly Still , " Coram Boy " is like Anne Rice rewriting " Nicholas Nickleby . " Turgid , overblown and too busy for its own good , this foundling-hospital melodrama is rich on filigree and style and short on emotional nourishment . The orphan play of the season , indeed . ( Imperial Theater ) <p> ' Frost/Nixon ' <p> Another London import , Peter Morgan 's play is more than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost and the fallen President Nixon . The overarching concern of screenwriter Morgan ( " The Queen , " " The Last King of Scotland " ) is the backroom tension that led to Nixon 's famous apology . Frost ( Michael Sheen ) was viewed as something of a lightweight and a playboy until he staged his journalistic coup , with the aid of a squadron of strategists and handlers , who went mano a mano with Nixon 's own pit bulls . It was a high-stakes gamble Frost almost lost . With his tight , polyester pants , Italian loafers ( Nixon called them " effeminate " ) and shaggy 1970s blow-dry cut , Sheen plays Frost with a slight Austin Powers twinkle in his eye . Frank Langella seizes control of the stage with a masterful performance as the lumbering politician with the unquenchable will to succeed . More comic than sinister , Langella gives a brilliant performance , one that sustains this suspenseful battle of nerves down to the final , fortuitous encounter . ( Bernard B. Jacobs Theater ) <p> ' Radio Golf ' <p> August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams and disappointments of American life in the 20th century . Directed by Atlanta 's Kenny Leon , " Radio Golf " may not have the fecund poetic sweep of Wilson 's final masterpieces " Gem of the Ocean " and " King Hedley II , " but it is a warm and vital celebration of the will of the common man to stare down the monolith of progress . <p> In this cautionary urban tale and comedic variation on the story of Faust , a pair of golf-playing , middle-class African-American real estate developers are poised to bulldoze their blighted childhood neighborhood and put up a shopping center . But their ill-considered scheme comes to a halt in a blaze of hubris , betrayal and , for the central character at least , a last-minute flash of grace and redemption . <p> As Pittsburgh mayoral candidate Harmond Wilks and his wife , Mame , Harry Lennix and Tonya Pinkins give smartly polished , almost effortless-looking performances . James A. Williams ' take on the smug , self-centered Roosevelt Wilks , who buys a radio station and starts a program called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real blood and guts of this production are Anthony Chisholm as gritty street prophet Joseph Barlow and John Earl Jelks as the fiercely eloquent Sterling Johnson , who leads an insurrection to save the neighborhood . " Radio Golf " is not a flawless play . After a rollicking first act , Wilson ties everything together a bit too easily and self-consciously . But his essential message is for all time : Man is flawed , but goodness , decency and common sense shall prevail .

As Barry Champlain , Liev Schreiber is an out-of-control , late-night radio host who ca n't get juiced about anything more substantive than the next call . Or the next shot of Jack Daniel 's and line of coke . Closed inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by the level of racist demagoguery and stupidity he encounters , the gonzo personality is just a few steps away from a nervous breakdown . What makes Schreiber 's performance so arresting is the way the audience gets to see his character 's disingenuousness and hear the gullibility of his fictional listeners all at the same time . We 're in on the joke . But ultimately , Champlain is a cat-and-mouse con artist who ends up loathing the very thing that feeds him . So enormous is the weight of Schreiber 's presence that you almost forget the rest of the ensemble , yet some of the voice work from the other end of the airwaves ( especially by Sebastian Stan ) is hysterical and rich . Score another Broadway triumph for Goodman Theatre director Robert Falls , and bet on Schreiber getting a Tony nomination Tuesday . ( Longacre Theatre ) <p> MUSICAL REVIVALS <p> ' A Chorus Line ' <p> A rigorous reconstruction of Michael Bennett 's 1975 landmark featuring direction by his original co-choreographer , Bob Avian , this " Chorus Line " is a joyous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Broadway-goers too young to remember the fuss of the first go-round . Nothing has been pared down here , from the cast of more than 30 would-be , all-confessing chorus liners to Marvin Hamlisch 's hard-driving , bell-bottom-era score . Particularly strong are Jason Tam ( as Paul , the sweet former burlesque dancer with the horrified Puerto Rican parents ) ; Jerry Schecter ( as " I Can Do That " Mike ) , Chryssie Whitehead and Tony Yazbeck as newlyweds Khristine and Al ( " Sing ! " ) and Charlotte d'Amboise as Cassie . A company-created show that was reality-based before reality-based was cool , " Chorus Line " remains a " singular sensation " more than 30 years after its arrival . ( Gerald Schoenfeld Theater ) <p> ' Company ' <p> Are we being too picky when we say that director John Doyle 's streamlined approach to Stephen Sondheim 's study of masculine loneliness does n't live up to expectations ? Perhaps asking actors to sing , dance and play musical instruments is a shortsighted approach , after all . The sketches involving pot-smoking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Heather Law 's reading of Amy 's " I 'm Not Getting Married " is not just hurried ; it 's incomprehensible . On the upside , anything involving Marta ( Angel Desai ) and Barcelona-bound April ( Elizabeth Stanley ) is first-rate . Playing a role created by Elaine Stritch ca n't be easy , but Barbara Walsh 's Joanne is both gutsy and sultry . And that brings us , now , to Raul Esparza as the forever-unhappy , sorry-grateful Bobby . Esparza is expressive without doing much , but his performance seems to languish until that final barn burner , " Being Alive .
