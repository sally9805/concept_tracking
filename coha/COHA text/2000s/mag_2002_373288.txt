In the ' 80s , a perm was supposed to leave your hair a Geena Davis-style froth of curls . But now that pin-straight hair like Gwyneth Paltrow 's is the must-do do , the technology is catching up . The Japanese straight perm , a.k.a . " Japanese relaxer " or " super straight , " makes hair hang straight for as long as six months and works on every type of hair except African . But if your calendar is full or your pockets are n't , it might be wiser to buy straightener in a box from the store : a Japanese straight perm can take up to eight hours in the salon and cost as much as $700 . " Some straight perms are done with a hot iron and are very time consuming , and some are done with chemicals and are less time consuming , " explains Karla Newgarden-Takahara , a stylist at the Manhattan salon Space . " For my clients , I usually recommend the milder one . It 's a lot less time , and it 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that most women make their hair straight : " Most people do n't look that great with no body and no texture and no movement in their hair . " Sounds as if we should aspire to look more like Ozzy Osbourne than Gwyneth ( who blow-dries her hair ) . <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent
