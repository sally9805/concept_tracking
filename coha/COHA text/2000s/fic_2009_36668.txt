Rome , 1605 <p> Blood ! " The world 's most significant ring dented the tabletop ; the fist bore it crashing into the wood again and again with each word . " We must have blood . " <p> The secret room , smaller than a bedchamber , offered a faint echo of the final word . In the shadows along the cold stone wall , a small black beetle clattered softly to the corner . <p> " But , Your Holiness , " Cardinal Venitelli sputtered , his sleeve trembling as he held up his hand ever so slightly , crimson skullcap twitching twice . " This book is in English . Who would pay attention to that ? " <p> " The book is circumstantial ! " the Pope interrupted , bellowing . " If we are to win back that dirty little island , the time is now . We would never have attempted this with Elizabeth , but James has been handed the throne . He is a proud man , and now he has set his intellectual talents , such as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both overly assured and mentally distracted . The time is ripe . " <p> " But  --  when you say blood . . . " Venitelli had no idea how to finish the sentence . <p> Pope Clement 's red cape rose and fell with each labored breath . A white , translucent collar from the underdressing crested at the neck . Fire hissed in the hearth at the opposite end of the room . <p> " Blood will stop the book . Stopping the book will unravel James 's plan for En gland . The plan unraveled builds a bridge from Rome to London . That bridge will bring En gland back to the Church . You must at least see God 's humor , if not His plan , in this . " <p> The small stone room in which the two men sat was quite hidden . It was unknown to all but the Pope 's most intimate visitors . From the outside , the door was invisible , hidden by the stones in the long hallway . Inside , the room was bare of furniture save for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tabletop illuminated the walls . The walls were draped floor to ceiling with thick tapestries , which did their best to absorb all sound . The images woven there were also red , stabbed with thorns : hunting scenes of startling violence . The characters seemed to move fitfully in the flickering light . <p> The floor was nearly covered with a deep , intricately patterned carpet that had been stolen during the Crusades , it was said , from Saladin himself . Cardinal Venitelli always fancied he could smell Saladin 's encampment the moment he stepped on the rug . He had often struggled to explain the sensation to himself . The reason was just beyond his mind 's grasp . The room itself seemed accustomed to harsh words . <p> " Yes , " the cardinal managed , " but the exact meaning  --  " <p> " You need not concern yourself with exact meanings . " Pope Clement relished thinking of himself as an impatient man : it prompted quick action on the part of subordinates .

Alas , he is an intelligent man in a mire of idiots . But to the point : a scholar of the Cambridge group is this night to be  --  what word is best ? Eliminated . When that happens , we shall introduce into their midst our avenging angel . " <p> That phrase was a code well-known to the cardinal , but to assure himself he began to ask , " By which you mean to say  --  " <p> " These tapestries are elegant , are they not ? " Clement looked away . <p> The cardinal understood : His Holiness must not say the name of his chief assassin  --  his avenging angel . In this way he could honestly say , in future conversations , that he had not called for him  --  not by name  --  and had certainly never spoken with him . That task was assigned to the cardinal , who did not relish it . His face grew ashen and his voice quavered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question to go to En gland , and kill  --  " <p> " Certainly not ! Hush ! " Clement rolled his head around his shoulders . " Tell him only that he is to be assigned to the translators of the King James Bible . Emphasize the Bible . Then say to him these precise words : ' The turning of the wheel by the tilling of the wheat . ' " <p> Venitelli felt a fist tighten in his belly . How many times before had he conveyed such coded phrases to the man in question , subsequently leading to foul murder ? <p> " The turning of the wheel by the tilling of the wheat , " Venitelli repeated , nodding . <p> The Pope smiled , but did not look at the cardinal . " We are using the man in question for his special talents  --  abilities which only he possesses . He has a telum secretus , if We may be permitted a dramatic flair . " <p> " But our brother 's actual task  --  his assignment  --  " <p> " The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal Venitelli , " the Pope said soothingly , as if to a boy of seven , " is that you rarely grasp the import of any situation . You do , however , operate with discretion . You must understand that We will stop at nothing to reclaim En gland , bring her back to Mother Church . It is God 's plan . We have in mind a series of events , in fact , though they may take several years to unfold , which will achieve Us this goal . " <p> " Yes , " Venitelli 's voice betrayed his absolute confusion . <p> The Pope leaned forward , his face close to Venitelli 's , and he barely spoke above a whisper , but the sound of his voice was thunder . <p> " This will be my legacy , do you understand ? History will write me as the man who restored En gland to the True Church . And that begins with the destruction of this book  --  this folly to which James aspires . " <p> The cardinal 's nostrils were momentarily assailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic prayers . Though he did not speak Arabic , he believed that the prayers were calling for the blood of infidels . He glared down at Saladin 's rug . Was it possible that a curse of the vanquished Islamic warriors lingered on the rug , infecting decisions made in this room ? Perhaps that would account for the odd smells that attacked his senses , and the Pope 's disconcerting passion . <p> " Are you attempting to think ? " The Pope glared at Venitelli . " Are you giving second thought to Our words ? " <p> The cardinal stood immediately . " A thousand pardons , Your Holiness . " He reached for the papal ring . " God 's plan is glorious , and your name will live forever . " <p> The Pope offered his hand , sighing  --  Venitelli kissed the ring . <p> Cardinal Venitelli bowed , turned , and hastened toward the secret door .

He fought to quell his worst fear : that the Pope had lost his mind . <p> He slowed his pace only slightly , trying to decide which disturbed him more , the conversation he had just endured with his Pope , or the one he was about to have with the coldest man in Italy . <p> Excerpted from The King Fames Conspiracy by Phillip DePoy . <br> Copyright 2009 by Phillip DePoy . <br> Published by St. Martin 's
