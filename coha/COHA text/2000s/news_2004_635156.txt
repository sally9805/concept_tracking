<p> Tony Gwynn , one of the most studious hitters in baseball history , has a difficult time believing the Barry Bonds he is seeing now is the same free-swinger he began watching 18 years ago . <p> This has nothing to do with steroid rumors and everything to do with the pure basics of hitting . <p> With Bonds making his first visit of 2004 to Wrigley Field this week , we asked one of the greatest hitters in history to walk us through the evolution of one of the most feared hitters of all time . <p> " He went from a kid who went up there hacking at everything , chasing bad pitches , to a patient hitter who is just dangerous every time he swings the bat , " Gwynn , a 15-time All-Star with the San Diego Padres , said in a phone interview from San Diego . " And now his mechanics are flawless . <p> " He has gotten so much better , and that 's hard to even think about . " <p> Gwynn took an early interest in Bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1985 draft , four picks ahead of Gwynn 's brother , Chris . There was a lot of hoopla surrounding a rookie named Bonds in 1986 , with his father , Bobby , being a three-time All-Star who was one of the first players to blend power and speed . <p> Barry Bonds struggled to live up to the hype , hitting .223 with 16 home runs and 48 RBI in his rookie season with the Pittsburgh Pirates . Bonds did n't hit .300 until 1990 , when he had a .301 average with 33 homers . <p> The next season , the transformation began to take place . Bonds , who struck out 102 times and walked 65 times as a rookie in 1986 , had 93 walks and 93 strikeouts in 1989 . Every season after that , he walked more than he struck out . <p> Bonds was no longer a free-swinger trying to live up to the hype . <p> With help from his father and godfather , Willie Mays , he had learned the art of patience . <p> " The thing that amazes me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwynn , who manages the San Diego State team and works as a part-time analyst for ESPN . It sounds simple . As a college coach , that 's the hardest thing for me to get my players to do . The evolution for him is going from a super-aggressive hitter to being very disciplined . <p> " His discipline is amazing , especially when you consider he would chase all kinds of balls . " <p> Consider that in his first 24 games this season , Bonds drew 43 walks . In the Montreal Expos ' first 24 games , the entire team drew 47 . Of course , Bonds is drawing mostly intentional walks , something rarely required for the Expos . <p> Managers are saying Bonds has changed the way they think about the game . Some , such as the Florida Marlins ' Jack McKeon , insist the best strategy is never to offer Bonds anything in the strike zone . Others , such as the Cubs ' Dusty Baker , say a cautious approach that still allows the fans to be entertained is the best plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter 's box , he finds himself in a position unique among players today  --  even superstars . <p> " He has gotten so good , people do n't take a chance , " Gwynn said . " When he comes up to the plate , he is getting everybody 's total concentration . He is getting every pitcher 's best pitch  --  and he just spits on it . " <p> While a frustrated Sammy Sosa might twist himself into a corkscrew chasing junk outside the zone , Bonds will wait patiently for his pitch , even if drawing another walk drives him crazy . <p> When a pitch crosses the zone , Bonds seems to know exactly what to do with it . <p> " His eye and his discipline are unmatched , " Gwynn said . <p> This brings up the question about whether Bonds , who will turn 40 on July 24 , will see enough good pitches to reach Hank Aaron 's magical mark of 755 homers . He entered the weekend third on the all-time list with 668 home runs , 46 behind Babe Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonds is on pace to walk 250 times . Aaron never drew more than 92 walks in a season . <p> What sets Bonds apart from most power hitters is his lack of strikeouts . In 2002 , he struck out 47 times , walked 198 times and had 149 hits , including 46 home runs . <p> " Usually , that is the last part to go , " Gwynn said of a hitter 's eye . " Something else will go first , your legs , whatever . I 'll bet you at 50 he could go up to the plate and tell you if a pitch is going to be ball or a strike as soon as it comes out of the pitcher 's hand . He 's that good . " <p> Early in his career , when Bonds had no clue what was coming , he was getting overshadowed by another heralded son , Ken Griffey Jr . of the Seattle Mariners . When Griffey broke in during the 1989 season , he instantly was tabbed to be a superstar for the next 20 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 438 homers and seemed on a reasonable pace to flirt with Aaron . This was after the 2000 season , when Bonds had 56 more homers but was six years older than Griffey . <p> As far as the Griffey-Bonds debate these days , Griffey 's history of injuries throws him out of the running . But it made good fodder for baseball fans in the early 1990s . <p> " Impossible to compare , " said Dennis Gilbert , Bonds ' former agent and now a special assistant to White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf . " One guy Griffey came in and got off to a way quicker start than Barry , with a lot more fanfare , and he was playing for a team that was contending right away . One guy was in the American League , one guy in the National League . If the guy in the American League wanted a day off , he could always DH . It 's a whole different world . <p> " They were both close in ability . Barry just got better and better . " <p> These days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , even in Griffey 's prime , he would get walked intentionally only in the most obvious situations . <p> Baker , who managed Bonds in San Francisco from 1993 to 2002 , has seen both sides of the debate . <p> " I understand it . I did n't like it , " Baker said of opposing teams walking his best hitter . " I especially did n't like it when nobody was on . But it 's part of the game , and you have to deal with it . " <p> And now that he 's in the other dugout ? <p> " It 's necessary sometimes , " Baker said . " The only problem I have with it , it cheats the people in the stands . But you have to risk that versus losing the game . " <p> Gwynn is a former player , but he is now a manager , so he is torn . <p> " I 'm a fan , too , so I want to see people pitch to him , " he said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll pitch around him . But I 'd have to say that the first time up , I 'd pitch to him . " <p> Gwynn recalled a game at Candlestick Park , when his Padres were playing the Giants . It was a tight game , Bonds was stepping to the plate and the Padres ' catcher was signaling for an intentional walk . <p> " I remember Steve Finley was in center field , yelling , ' Pitch to him , ' and I 'm in right , yelling , ' Do n't do it , " ' Gwynn said . " And that was in 1996 . " <p> All this is n't to say that Bonds does n't have his flaws . <p> Gwynn points to the stretch after Bonds hit his 659th home run on Opening Day . He needed one more to tie Mays . <p> He did n't get it until six games later . During that stretch , with a national media throng following Bonds and Mays waiting in the tunnel each at-bat to greet his godson at the plate if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " When he is going good , he wo n't chase . When there 's something on the line ... , " Gwynn said . " Look at what he did until he got 660 . He was chasing every bad pitch thrown up there . He was the old Barry Bonds . " <p> Aside from the home-run hoopla is talk about whether Bonds can hit .400 . Bonds slipped below .400 this month when a sinus infection threw off his equilibrium and he went through an 0-for-15 slump . <p> Bonds shrugs off any talk about hitting .400 , pointing to all those walks . <p> But Gwynn said he thinks the walks will help Bonds become the first player to hit .400 since Ted Williams batted .406 in 1941 . <p> Bonds insists there are other factors working against him in the modern game . <p> " Hitting .400 is difficult because they change pitchers all the time , and they can walk you if they choose to , " Bonds told Bay Area reporters last week . " Tony Gwynn did n't do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to see . " <p> As the Giants prepare for their series against the Cubs beginning Tuesday , Bonds once again is hinting about early retirement . Seems like an odd thought for a player who might be doing his best work at the plate in his 19th season . <p> Gwynn , who regularly talks with Bonds , said the Giants ' disappointing start and the staggering number of walks might lead to a premature departure . <p> " I have to imagine it 's pretty frustrating , " Gwynn said of the walks . " That has probably taken some of the fun out it . If he is going to break Aaron 's record , he 's going to have to go some because they are n't going to pitch to him . But how much fun is it going up to the plate and walking 200 , 250-some times ? And that 's what it 's going to end up being . He is probably having more fun in batting practice . " barry vs. junior <p> These two famous sons have faced high expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . appeared to be destined for greater things than Barry Bonds . In 1999 , Griffey  --  coming off consecutive 56-homer seasons  --  was included on baseball 's All-Century team ; Bonds was snubbed . <p> Through 2000 , Griffey seemed the safer bet to break Hank Aaron 's all-time home-run record . He had 438 homers at 30 years old . Through 2000 , Bonds had 494 homers but was six years older . <p> Here 's how they stacked up through their first six years in the majors ( 1986-91 for Bonds , 1989-94 for Griffey ) and their last six ( through 2003 ) .
