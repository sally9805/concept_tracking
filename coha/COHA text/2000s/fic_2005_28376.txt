Oh My Stars By Lorna Landvik Random House Lorna Landvik On her sixteenth birthday , violet mathers nearly bled to death in a thread factory . The incident , as it was referred to in the company 's 1935 logbook , happened on the graveyard shift , just before break time , when the pounding and the whirring and the squeaking of the machines had crescendoed into a percussion concert conducted by the devil himself . Lamont Travers , the foreman , told her later in the hospital that the worst accidents always happen before break ; people ca n't wait to smoke their cigarettes or drink their coffee and talk about whose man or whose woman had done who the wrongest . Violet had n't cared about any of that ; she wanted only to cut into the marble cake RaeAnn Puffer had brought , wanted only to hear her co-workers raise their tired , smoky voices in a chorus of Happy Birthday . Excited and jumpy as a puppy with a full bladder , the birthday girl broke the cardinal rule of the Marcelline Thread factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least three signs posted on the dusty brick walls : do not attempt to clear or repair the machinery without first turning machinery off . She was running the Klayson , a big reliable machine that sweat oil as it wound and cut dozens of spools of thread . There were women who were possessive of their machines ( Lula Wendell even named hers and explained that whenever the machine spit out thread or overwound , it was because Pauletta was on her monthly ) . Violet had formed no deep attachments to the masses of metal , preferring the job of runner and working whatever machine needed running . When she ran the Klayson , she felt as if she was wrangling a harmless but stubborn old cow , and it was almost with affection that she scolded the machine when it huffed and burped to a stop . Now , come on , gal , I ai n't got time for this , said Violet , and with one hand on the Klayson 's metal flank , she stuck the other up into its privates , feeling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the benign old cow turned into a crazed bull , sucking her arm up between its jaws . A flash fire of shock and pain exploded at Violet 's elbow joint and in her brain , and just as red hot was her outrage : But it 's my birthday ! RaeAnn , who was next to Violet on the floor , screamed , and Polly Ball , the only woman on the floor to have gone to college ( she would have graduated from UNC-Raleigh with a degree in art history had she not been summoned home after her father died ) , thought : that 's the scream in the Edvard Munch painting . Violet too heard the scream even as she fainted , even as the weight of her falling body helped further tear skin from skin and bone from bone . When she woke up in the hospital , her stub-arm wrapped and bleeding like a rump roast in butcher 's paper , the screaming was still inside her headwas in her head for more years than she cared to count . When the morphine curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sweet sixteenth . Violet should have known better ; in her short history she had learned that expectations only deepened the disappointment that inevitably stained every special occasionnot that many were celebrated . In excavating her mind for memories of parties and presents , she 'd only been able to dig up those concerning her sixth birthday , when her mother baked her a yellow cake iced with raspberry jelly and gave her a real present to unwrap . It was a rag doll Violet immediately christened Jellycakes , commemorating what she told her mother was the best birthday cake and the best birthday doll ever ever ever ever made . The remembrance of that lone celebration was ruined by what her mother did three days later , which was to run off with the pharmacist from Henson Drugs . Considering her robust good health , Erlene spent a lot of time at the pharmacy window ; every other customer walked away tucking green or brown bottles of tonics and pills and elixirs into their purses or pockets , but all her mama left the drugstore with was a flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet liked Mr. Gladstone , the pharmacisthe gave her root-beer barrels , and once a Henson 's Drugs ( For All Your Drug &; Sundries Needs ) calendar with a picture of a kitten on itbut after he robbed her of her mother , Violet came to think of the druggist as the criminal he was ; a man guilty of grand theft . She was a child at the time of the crime , had n't even started the first grade yet . Ten years later , when Violet lost her arm , it occurred to her that this was not her first amputation , but her second . Later , when she came to know how love can slam reason and responsibility to the mat as easily as a heavyweight takes down a bantam , Violet forgave her mother for running off ( Yarby Gladstone did have nice clean hands , after all , and an entire set of teeth , or at least all of the ones that showed in a smile ) , but she never forgave Erlene for forgetting about her , for never sending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mothers who disappear off the face of the earth leave their children feeling as if they 've disappeared too ; disappeared from everything they thought was certain and safe and true . Abandonment can be crueler to a child than death ; Violet would rather her mama had died because at least a grave would have given her a place to visit , something to touch , something to talk to . There were few people in Mount Crawford , Kentucky , surprised by the young Mrs. Mathers taking a permanent leave of absence ; it did n't take any great power of observation to see that Violet 's parents were as mismatched as a crow and a canary . Judd Mathers was Erlene 's senior by fifteen years and had always looked older than his age ; he was not yet forty when his wife left , and yet his long thin face was as creased as a bloodhound 's , his black hair leeched to a lusterless gray . He was one of those men hobbled by his inability to exercise his emotions ( except for anger ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really loved his wife . She remembered him smiling at her mama 's jokes , watching Erlene with a shy delight when she put the corn bread on the table , crowing , Ta-da ! or when she hung the clothes out on the line , grabbing his union suit and pretending to waltz with it . What registered most on the young Mrs. Mathers 's face when she looked at her husband was disbelief and impatience , as if she were always asking herself , How did I get here ? and How soon can I leave ? Had she not gone and got herself pregnant , Erlene would have laughed out loud at Judd 's marriage proposal , would have swatted it away as if it was a black and pesky fly . There was a certain flightiness to her mama that , even as a child , Violet recognized . The young ( she was only eighteen when Violet was born ) , trim woman could be in the middle of kneading dough when she 'd wipe her hands on the dish towel and dash out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to see what was playing at the picture show , and would Violet mind punching down the bread when it rose ? The little girl longed to chase after her but had learned early on that she was usually included in those things from which Erlene needed to escape . When her mother was in an affectionate mood , she might invite Violet onto her lap , but it was n't long before the girl would be flung off , as Erlene would be distracted by chores or a sudden need to manicure her nails , to wave-set her hair , or dance to the crystal radio in the boxy little room she called the parlor . Erlene was full of fun ideasLet 's pick raspberries and have a picnic on Mount Crawford ! Let 's throw a tea party on the porch ! and once or twice these ideas blossomed into reality , but most always Violet would be left waiting on the crumbling front steps , her eagerness bright as a balloon and just as sure to deflate . The bulk of memories concerning her mother were those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into the sorry club of wallflowerhood ) , and yet the little girl believed her mama when she called her her precious flower , clung to those rare terms of endearment , knowing they were proof of her love . Violet made all sorts of excuses for her , but in her deep heart she knew that mothers who loved their precious flowers did n't leave them to grow up in a musty old house on the edge of town with a father whose personality vacillated between melancholia and meanness ; surely Erlene knew how that would make a precious flower wither up and die ? Violet . It did n't take long for everyone to see that the child had been misnamed . Gawd Almighty , Uncle Maynard said the first time he saw her , she 's homelier than Tate Seevers ! ( Tate Seevers was the one-eyed World War I vet who lived in a shack outside the junkyard with his half-wolf dog . ) Uncle Clyde nodded . Yuh , I reckon you 'll see prettier faces in a horse barn . These stories were gleefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an endless collection . My mama says only people with hexes on ' em got faces like yours . I heard your daddy says the only way you 're ever gon na get a boyfriend is if he sends you to a school for the blind . Sit up , Violet , speak ! Good dog . The Matherses ' back porch was the local speakeasy for Judd and his brothers-in-law , who 'd congregate there to drink the corn liquor Uncle Maynard showed some talent at making ; but after Erlene left , her brothers never came around . It was n't shame over their sister 's transgressions ( Violet doubted they had shame , over their transgressions or anyone else 's ) that kept them away ; but their abandonment was double the hurt for her father , who not only lost his wife , but his drinking buddies . Violet did n't miss them at allthey were loud and crude , like most drunksand she could easily live the rest of her life without her cousin Byron and the two gifts he so conscientiously gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuffed the girl 's arms in welts and the constant taunts about her looks . Why does everyone think I 'm so ugly , Mama ? A giggle erupted from Erlene 's throat ; she had an odd sense of what was funny and what was n't . Violet , now put that away , she said , recovering her composure . It 's time for bed . Erlene 's interest in things domestic was minimal , but occasionally she 'd bring out her sewing basket ( made of willow , it was the sort of crafted object that would be sold years later as folk art for the kind of money its creator , a mountain woman named Gimpy Mary , never saw in her lifetime ) , and wanting to share somethinganythingwith her mother , Violet was determined to sew too . Like her father , she was good with her hands ; they were quick and deft and seemed able to figure out things with little guidance from her brain . Jabbing the needle in the handkerchief she was hemming for her father , Violet set it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone does not think you 're ugly , said Erlene , bringing the faded patchwork quilt up to her daughter 's neck and crimping its edges . It 's just that , well , I suppose it 's because you 've got a chin that looks like it wants to pick a fight . She smiled , fondling the jaw that would have fit a man 's face better than a little girl 's . You 'll just have to work on your other attributes . What are attributes , ' Mama ? asked Violet , liking Erlene 's hand on her face , even as she disparaged it . Well , look at me : I 'm pretty , but I do n't stop there . I work on things , things like being smart and cleverwho can tell a joke as good as your mama ? No one , whispered Violet . That 's right . Plus , I 'm a good dancer and have excellent grammar . Those are all attributes , just to name a few . Erlene , shouted Judd from the kitchen , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and got up as if she were an old lady whose bones hurt . She stood at the side of the bed for a moment , the light from the kerosene lamp throbbing like an ache against the wall . Do n't say ai n't , ' Violet , she said finally . Ai n't ' is a word that makes you sound like you do n't care . Okay , Mama , whispered Violet , willing to do anything asked of her . I wo n't ever say ai n't . ' She did n't either , until her mother left , until Violet realized that every time she disobeyed her absent mother , she felt a tiny jolt of power that let her forget , for a breath , how much she missed her . So she said ai n't and did all the other things Erlene had told her not to : she chewed her fingernails and burped and did n't brush her hair and slept in her clothes . She became a dirty , tangle-haired , wild-looking thing ; the kind of girl the school nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the kind of girl who found notes like You stink ! and Take a bath ! scattered like land mines inside her desk . As the years passed , Violet became less a stranger to soap and water , but her improved hygiene could n't deflect attention from her freakish growth surge : by age thirteen she was five feet eleven , and it did n't take Violet long to realize that height does a homely girl no favors . Hey , Stretch ! Look , a giraffe escaped from the zoo ! Hey , Olive Oyl ! Puberty was not done playing dirty tricks either , deepening Violet 's voice like a boy 's and inspiring her tormenters to add the name Froggy to the many in their arsenal , or to ask why Olive Oyl had a voice like Popeye . Every inch she grew on the outside , every bass note her voice registered , made her smaller on the inside . Continues ...
