When Theodore Roosevelt challenged William Howard Taft for the Republican presidential nomination in 1912 , few cheered . Enemies accused him of monumental egotism , and most admirers , foreseeing his defeat , were worried that posterity would frown on his quest for an unprecedented third term . But as Roosevelt saw it , he had to involve himself . He had left the White House in 1909 with the expectation that Taft , his good friend and chosen successor , would continue on the progressive course set by the Roosevelt Administration . Instead , Taft had filled his Cabinet with corporate lawyers , bungled a chance to overhaul an antiquated tariff that enriched manufacturers at consumers ' expense and undermined Roosevelt 's farsighted environmentalism . Taft means well , Roosevelt would say , " but he means well feebly . " <P> Then came the midterm elections of 1910 . The G.O.P. lost control of the House , and Roosevelt began criticizing Taft 's policies in print . The final rupture occurred a year later when Taft 's Attorney General filed an antitrust suit against the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had personally approved . T.R. was outraged . The decision to challenge Taft soon followed . T.R. 's campaign would not succeed , but the ideals that he and his Bull Moose Party enunciated in 1912 would resonate in American political life for decades . They still do . They shaped much of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal and influenced domestic policy until the 1980s , when the Reagan Revolution began dismantling social programs . Even now , echoes of that campaign can be heard in debates on what government should do for citizens and how to make it more accountable . <P> Roosevelt 's odds of unhorsing an incumbent President were long , but not as long as they would have been in previous election years , when nominees were chosen by a handful of bosses and rubber-stamped at state party caucuses . In 1912 a dozen states were letting voters do the choosing in primaries , a political innovation just beginning to catch on . If T.R. could win big in the primaries , he could present himself as the people 's choice and Taft as the creature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot at 362 votes , and he stunned the party by walking off with 278 of them . Taft finished a distant second , with 48 . But in the 36 states without primaries , Roosevelt was outflanked by the bosses . In June , as delegates headed to Chicago for the national convention , Taft 's men boasted that their candidate had 557 votes  --  17 more than he needed for the nomination . T.R. could see that his primary delegates plus delegates from renegade factions elsewhere had left him about 70 votes short . His aides noisily challenged the legitimacy of scores of Taft supporters , but when it became clear that he could not win , T.R. executed one of the gutsiest maneuvers in the annals of American presidential campaigns : he denounced the Republicans as thieves and bolted the convention . <P> A bolt spared Roosevelt the humiliation of losing to Taft . It also kept his candidacy alive on a brand-new ticket of his own creation , the National Progressive Party , better known as the Bull Moose Party , a nickname that came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled out to ask how he felt . " Like a bull moose , " he yelled back .
