One bruise at a time , CRAIG BIGGIO has made his way into baseball 's record book Photograph Photograph // Craig Biggio never has taken a sledgehammer-thwack ! - to his face , but he is quite certain he knows exactly what the pain would feel like . In 1997 , he was hit in the left cheekbone by a four-seamer from the Cubs ' Jeremi Gonzalez . " I was on the ground and was n't sure if anything was broken , " Biggio says . " All I could think about was , " Where do I go from here ? " and about Dickie Thon . But I got lucky again . " Biggio has been hit by pitches a numbing 266 times , leaving him only a short , but painful , path left to reach Don Baylor 's career record of 267 . Biggio has been plunked by 201 pitchers-the first one , Tim Birtsas , got him in Biggio 's 60th career game , in 1989 . Remarkably , Biggio never has gone on the disabled list or broken a bone after taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit as many times as I have , you consider yourself fortunate that you 've been able to walk away from probably 15 or 20 that were real scary , " says Biggio , whose helmet has absorbed four errant fastballs during his 18 seasons . A father of three , he adds , " I explained to my kids , " If I walk to first , it hurts like hell ; if I jog , it was n't bad . ' " Biggio , 39 , knows enough about the game 's history to appreciate his good fortune . Ray Chapman died after getting hit in the head in 1920 , and the promising careers of Tony Conigliaro , who was hit in the eye in 1967 , and Thon , who suffered a partial loss of vision after getting hit in 1984 , were forever altered . Biggio also has watched longtime teammate Jeff Bagwell twice suffer a broken hand after getting plunked . So why has this 5-11 , 185-pound target allowed his body to endure such punishment ? And why has he never rushed the mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand close to the plate , you understand that you 're going to get hit , " Biggio says . " My leg kick was so big that I could n't get out of the way . I used the kick to get the best out of my ability and to hit for more power . My swing was so timed that once I recognized the pitch , there was nowhere to go . " Biggio finally adjusted his swing last season , reducing his leg kick and keeping both feet on the ground to improve his balance and vision . He went from being hit 27 times in 2003 to 15 in ' ' 04 . " Now I see the ball better throughout the pitch , and I 'm able to move away quicker , " he says . But this season , Biggio is getting hit nearly as often as he walks . After absorbing two pitches in the same game last week , Biggio had been hit 10 times , and he had only 14 walks . Though the Astros have been unable to muster much offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those from 2004 . He carried a .333 on-base percentage and .273 batting average into the week , compared with .337 and .281 for the full season in ' ' 04 . Biggio insists he never looks to get hit and points out that his prominent elbow guard has nothing to do with his propensity for hovering dangerously close to the plate . " One time I got hit on the elbow , " he says . " The next day I thought of wearing the guard but figured , what are the odds of getting hit there again ? Well , Danny Darwin ran a two-seamer in that hit me in the exact spot . I wanted to cry , it hurt so much . After that , I said never again . " Biggio will continue to take his licks , knowing that he creates opportunities for his team by getting hit . Case in point : Earlier this season , with the Astros leading the Brewers , 7-3 , in the eighth inning , Biggio produced a run when he got thumped with the bases loaded . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . " If you get something out of it , then it 's definitely worth it , " he says . " That situation was the ultimate reward-you 're taking one for the team and getting an RBI out of it . " Pitching to Biggio is tricky-he crowds the plate , but pitchers still must work him inside to offset his ability to drive the ball to the right-center gap . Earlier this season , Mets closer Braden Looper hit Biggio leading off the ninth inning of a scoreless game-one game after Looper had struck him out on a slider down and away . " I 'm a sinkerball pitcher , so I knew I had to go with my strength , " Looper says . " We know his game plan , and he 's made a great living standing close . If you do n't throw inside to establish that part of the plate , he 'll make you pay . " Looper ran the count to 1-1 before running a pitch into Biggio . " I was trying to go up under his hands , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Looper . " I wanted to finish him off inside . " Says Biggio : " I thought I had a chance ( to hit it ) , but then it ran in and I opened up just a little , and it hit me right in the forearm . I thought he broke it and remember thinking , Oh , man , I 'm going to pay the price for this one . ' " Fortunately for Biggio , nothing was broken , and even though the Astros ended up losing the game , 1-0 , in 11 , he took the HBP in stride . " Pitchers who work inside know they 'll hit guys , " he says . " And as a hitter , you 're going to get hit . That 's part of the game . " Biggio figures that when he tops Baylor , it wo n't stir the baseball masses , though the Hall of Fame has expressed interest in acquiring his elbow guard . " It 'll be nice to be in the record books , but I think just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " Biggio says . " He played the game the right way . " Baylor , for one , is happy to pass the torch to Biggio . " Craig is a Hall of Fame-type player , " says Baylor , the Mariners " hitting coach . " He plays hard and plays hurt . " Biggio says : " The thing I laugh about now is that if you would have told me 18 years ago that I 'd be closing in on this record , I would have told you , " No way humanly possible . " You 've got to have some fate on your side . Somehow , I 've been very fortunate to withstand all those hits and walk away from them all . " Especially the sledgehammer. // These stats are through June 22 Biggio feared the worst after a pitch from Looper caught him flush on the forearm . Sidebar KEN ROSENTHAL SAYS ... Biggio exceeds the Hall standard Craig Biggio should be a Hail of Famer even if he fails to get the 290 or so hits he needs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : dominance , all-around excellence , superiority at his position-Biggio meets the Cooperstown standard and then some . Biggio has been an All-Star at catcher and second base . He spent the 2003 season and part of ' ' 04 playing center field . His 403 stolen bases at the start of the week are a testament to his speed ; his 243 home runs are a testament to his power . From 1992 to 2001 , he batted .297 and averaged 110 runs . No National League second baseman was better . Yet , Biggio is a player who transcends normal statistical analysis . Baseball historian Bill James rates him the fifth-best second baseman of all time , pointing out that in 1997 he was hit by 34 pitches and grounded into zero double plays . Breaking Don Baylor 's career record for hit by pitches will only underscore Biggio 's " whatever it takes " mentality . Biggio never has finished higher than fourth in MVP voting , but he is a four-time Gold Glove winner at second and a seven-time All-Star . He has led the NL in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also has hit 20 or more homers six times , including a career-high 24 last season at age 38 . Total gamer.Total Hall of Famer. // <p>
