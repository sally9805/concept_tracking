He could be a freak or a fluke : a 12-year-old with a hit CD . But the kid is no country-music aberration , no preteen Billy Ray Cyrus . As he shows on this set of puppy-love tunes and hound-dog rave-ups , Gilman is a real singer  --  sort of Charlotte Church gone Nashville  --  with impressive breath control and a fine sense of drama . On the title ballad , for instance , he 'll hold a long note without hoking it up , without forsaking its texture or personality . This is a voice of choirboy purity , before it gets weathered and leathered by whiskey and cigarettes . Listen to it before it changes ; puberty awaits Billy like a bad career move . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
