<p> Oguchi Onyewu is bouncing around Stade de Sclessin , trying to stay warm on a harsh March night in the Meuse Valley . Kickoff is moments away and the hotblooded crowd of 27,000 is in full verse , a throaty pregame tribute to Onyewu and his Standard Liege teammates . <p> Banners the size of highway billboards , distinguishing the most fanatical red-clad supporters , hang from the upper decks : Ultras Inferno . Hell Side . Guerilleros . Songs coming from the small , blue-splashed congregation supporting the opponent , Genk , are quickly swamped by the unreceptive hosts . <p> Amid the madness at the riverside pitch , dwarfed by the festival of color and ceremony , one can spot a few red , white and blue banners : American flags , lying atop a small roof near the field , stuck to a facade , draped over a fan 's shoulders . <p> " It 's a nice feeling to know they appreciate you , and appreciate where you 're from , " Onyewu , 23 , said after the 1-0 victory . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , raised in Silver Spring and Olney with his four siblings and came through Montgomery County 's youth leagues . He played two seasons at Sherwood High School , enrolled in the U.S. under-17 residency program in Florida , returned home to graduate from Sherwood , then played two years at Clemson University before embarking on his European adventure . <p> In his second season with Standard Liege , Onyewu ( pronounced Own-YAY-woo ) has developed into one of the most fearsome defenders in the modest Belgian league . <p> This summer , his life  --  and bank account  --  could undergo a dramatic transformation . Onyewu probably will start for the United States at the World Cup in Germany and , if he performs well and reinforces the favorable reviews he has already received throughout Europe , he could become the subject of a multimillion-dollar transfer to a prominent club in England . Manchester United , Middlesbrough and Charlton reportedly are among the suitors . <p> " I am very afraid we will lose him , " said Standard General Manager Pierre Francois , who , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an offer reaches an undisclosed threshold and the player wants to go . <p> " After the World Cup , who knows ? The big clubs in Europe like him very much . " <p> What they , as well as U.S. Coach Bruce Arena , like most about Onyewu is his physical presence on the back line . By soccer standards , Onyewu is massive  --  6 feet 4 , 210 pounds , shoulders as broad as an SUV and only a teaspoon of body fat . <p> " Physically we do n't have to worry about him , " Arena said . " God took care of that area . " <p> Onyewu did n't make his national team debut until October 2004 at RFK Stadium and has appeared in only 12 matches overall  --  an alarmingly brief tenure for a player in contention for a World Cup role . But steady adaptations to the international game and those unmistakable physical attributes have earned him a vital role in Arena 's defensive corps . <p> If Arena decides to use a four-man back line , the outside slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherundolo on the right . The central tandem is n't as clear , with Onyewu likely taking one spot and either Eddie Pope , Carlos Bocanegra or Cory Gibbs the other . <p> " I 'm only 23 years old and there are a lot of great players who will never play in the World Cup , " Onyewu said . " So to even have the opportunity to be there with the team in Germany , that would be something special . When I was younger , I never thought that was something I would want to do ; I did n't understand the meaning of playing in the World Cup . Now I understand how incredible that would be . " <p> Onyewu started playing soccer at age 5 and , although he also tried basketball after an early growth spurt , his performances on the field made him realize soccer was the best sport to pursue . He played for FC Potomac , an elite club team in Maryland , and soon was invited to youth national team camps . <p> At the 1999 Under-17 World Championship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the U.S. team , which also included future national team stars Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley , claimed fourth place  --  its best finish ever . <p> Two years later , while a student at Clemson , Onyewu traveled with the under-20 squad to Argentina for the World Youth Championship and a second-round elimination . <p> He had thought about pursuing a European career after high school , but " I needed to grow up a little bit before making a big decision , " he said . After two years of college , though , " I knew it was time . " <p> Onyewu signed with Metz in the French first division , but by the time he arrived , the club had been relegated to the second division , complicating his contractual status ; he would still get paid , but could not play . He waited for the deal to be reworked , days turning into weeks , weeks into months . <p> " He was getting frustrated , but we kept in touch with him and encouraged him to be patient , " said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . " <p> By the time he was permitted to play , he had fallen behind the club 's more experienced defenders . So Metz loaned him to La Louviere in Belgium , where he played one season . He was eager to reestablish himself at Metz , but the club had lost interest . <p> That 's when Standard stepped in . <p> " It 's one of my most beautiful stories , " Standard technical director Michel Preud'homme , a former Belgian World Cup goalkeeper , said with a proud smile . " Everybody in Belgium sees him , but nobody makes him an offer . We thought he was a good player who could grow and reach a high level . " <p> Besides his improving technical skills , Onyewu has helped himself with his workout regimen . <p> " Nobody on my team lifts weights . They think I take drugs , " he said , chuckling . " They look at it as an American mentality because they did n't grow up doing it . " <p> Now , Onyewu and 20-year-old Vincent Kompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two best defenders in the 18-team league . Standard , which has n't won the league title since 1983 , leads Anderlecht by one point in the league standings with four matches remaining . <p> The champion will receive an automatic berth in the Champions League , a prestigious and financially lucrative competition comprising the top teams throughout Europe . <p> Whether Onyewu would be around for it remains unclear . <p> " It was already difficult to keep him at the beginning of the season , " Preud'homme said . " We will see . For him , for his growth , it is better to try , if we make Champions League , to play one more year for us , to learn and to be ready to do the next step . " <p> As his playing time has increased , so too has his popularity with Liege fans . Magazine headlines have proclaimed , in French , " Oguchi , le superstar U.S. " and " Terminator . . . Onyewu est indestructible . " <p> Much to his chagrin , he also appeared in the gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Clijsters . " It was just ridiculous , " he said . " I met her at some club and , all of a sudden , we 're supposed to be a couple ? " <p> A 6-4 black man in a predominantly white country , Onyewu is easily identified when he ventures into the city after practice . <p> Recently , after parking his car near his favorite brasserie on the bending Boulevard de la Sauveniere , a stranger called out to him by his first name and warned him in French that the police had been towing vehicles from that spot . He thanked him and quickly moved it to a legal space . <p> Onyewu has grown quite comfortable in Liege , a once-gritty industrial city in the French-speaking Wallonia region , near the borders with Germany and the Netherlands , where barges still carry mounds of coal down the Meuse River . <p> He learned French on his own , then found a three-bedroom apartment in an upscale southern suburb and a knack for navigating his Chrysler through the city 's old streets . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has experienced prejudice . It has n't been a problem in Liege , where 10 nationalities and nine black players are represented on the club 's diverse roster , but it has on the road . <p> " There are some racist teams and racist players in Belgium , " he said . " One game , the fans were making monkey noises at some of our players . They just do n't like foreigners . It 's just ignorance . Some opposing players will say stupid stuff : ' You black this , black that . ' And you think to yourself , ' Now what did you achieve by saying that ? ' <p> " It makes you feel like cutting the guy 's head off , but you just try to control your emotions . " <p> Has he ever retaliated ? <p> " Oh , yeah , " he said , with a sly grin , " but discreetly . " <p> No matter where his pro career takes him , Onyewu appears to have a promising future with the U.S. team . <p> To measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico last year provided an enlightening gauge . In the first meeting , Arena decided to test his young defender with an unexpected starting assignment in one of the world 's most unforgiving settings : 120,000-seat Estadio Azteca in oxygen-deprived Mexico City . <p> Overall he performed reasonably well , but the moment everyone will remember came in the first half when he lost track of Mexican star Jared Borgetti , who scored on a short header to spark a 2-1 victory . <p> Six months later in Columbus , Ohio , with a World Cup berth going to the winner , Onyewu 's physical play unnerved Borgetti and helped the Americans to a 2-0 triumph . <p> Among the prominent clips on the U.S. Soccer Federation 's highlight DVD is the stoic Onyewu staring down Borgetti as the frustrated Mexican forward yells at him . " He was saying a heap of Spanish stuff , " Onyewu said . " I did n't understand a word of it , but I knew what he was thinking . " <p> Onyewu has scored just one goal for the U.S. team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beat Honduras , 2-1 , in the Gold Cup semifinals last summer . <p> But playing against CONCACAF opponents is a lot different than facing the likes of Italy and the Czech Republic , two of the Americans ' opponents in the first round of he World Cup . <p> Is Onyewu ready for those monumental tests ? <p> " I think so , " Arena said . " He showed his inexperience at the start , but every time he came back into camp , you could see the improvement . The way you learn is to get on the field and get burned once in a while . <p> " He 's learned from those experiences and gotten better and better . "
