Astronaut is the first studio album from Simon LeBon and the other four original members of Duran Duran in 21 years . <P> How has rock changed since you started out ? <P> We were never considered a rock band 20 years ago . We were pop with a capital P. <P> You 're an old family man now ... <P> I object to the word old . <P> O.K. , you 're a family man now . What do your daughters think of your old look ? <P> They 're mildly amused by it . But they also realize that there was something special going on for us guys then . <P> You 've aged well . You all have your own hair . <P> We always had a very strong visual image . We try and maintain it . We 're all in our 40s . That does n't mean you 've got to give up . My fashion guru is my wife . The best fashion advice she gives me is , " Simon , do n't . " <P> Any fashion regrets ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things to do with my life , yes , I have regrets there . I would have had more sex . People should have as much sex as they possibly can , actually . And it does n't have to be meaningful . <P> Maybe that 's your antiaging tonic . <P> That I think about sex every two seconds ? Quite possibly . We do a job that keeps a certain part of your psyche peeled and fresh . And we 're hapy . We 're useful . We provide a service that helps people get through their lives . There 's a certain childish naivet about the band which we 've protected and kept . <P> Is the entire band married to models ? <P> Someone 's got to keep the models happy .
