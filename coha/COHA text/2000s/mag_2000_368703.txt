It is easy to believe that politicians always break their promises , that what they say now wo n't matter after the election . But numerous studies show that in the past 40 years more than two-thirds of the promises made by presidential candidates during a campaign were enacted in some form once they were elected . So we are n't just electing a personality  --  we 're choosing an agenda . And on four critical issues , the differences between Bush and Gore are big . Here they are : <P> BUSH <P> TAXES <P> PLAN : Devote more than a third of the projected surplus  --  $1.6 trillion  --  to tax cuts , including a broad cut for all income brackets . Double the child tax credit , give a credit to married couples regardless of whether they pay the marriage penalty , and repeal the estate tax . <P> IMPACT : Nearly everyone gets a tax cut  --  particularly the wealthiest third of taxpayers . The long-term effect is cloudy : Bush argues that his cuts will encourage the economy to keep growing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn sour , ballooning deficits could return . And Congress is currently spending a fifth of the surplus . <P> THE SUPREME COURT <P> PLAN : Appoint Justices ( there will probably be two or more openings in the next four years ) like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas who look to the intent of the Founding Fathers when interpreting the Constitution . <P> IMPACT : Abortion will probably remain legal , but with more limitations . Vouchers for religious schools could be found constitutional , and the court could allow some prayer in schools . Affirmative action may be struck down or further limited , as could many federal laws that encroach upon state power , such as the Clean Air and Water Acts and the Americans with Disabilities Act . <P> HEALTH CARE <P> PLAN : Give uninsured families a $2,000 tax credit to help purchase insurance . Pass a patients ' bill of rights with a restricted right to sue HMOs . Turn Medicare into an insurance subsidy , giving seniors money for private insurance and prescription-drug coverage . <P> IMPACT : A patients ' bill with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up but leaves patients little recourse if HMOs do n't play fair . Privatizing Medicare will help cure its long-term financial troubles , but it risks creating a class system : full coverage for wealthy and low-income seniors , while those in the middle struggle to afford plans with prescription coverage . <P> SOCIAL SECURITY <P> PLAN : Use about half the Social Security surplus  --  roughly $1 trillion  --  to allow young workers to invest one-sixth of their payroll taxes in private accounts . <P> IMPACT : Depends on the stock market . The $1 trillion price tag means the program may go bankrupt 10 years earlier ; to cover the cost , Bush will have to cut benefits . If the market continues its historical rate of return of 7% a year ( or even if it gains a more modest 5% a year ) , such cuts would be painless because the private-account nest egg for most future beneficiaries would more than equal the benefits they would receive under the current system . But there 's no benefit floor to protect losers . <P> GORE <P> TAXES  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
