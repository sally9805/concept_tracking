The stillness of the air told him he was indoors  --  perhaps underground . He sat with a brick wall at his back , cool and damp . There was an animal smell . <br> He was n't alone in the darkness . Rustling ; breathing . Scraping  --  scraping of scales ? Rattling of bars . Some large caged creature , heavy tail sweeping the straw . <br> As far as he could tell , he was not sharing the creature 's cage  --  a small relief . <br> Time passed . <br> The rattling of bars , the rough sweeping of the scales , had a kind of off-kilter rhythm . It was peaceful to listen  --  to contemplate the complexity of it . <br> Lizard stink , rotting meat , and rust  --  the thing in the cage was immense . Beneath that there was the smell of gas , of burning gone cold . Stale tobacco ? The stones he sat on were littered with the scraps of old hand-rolled cigarettes . Gas  --  this part of the city was gaslit . <br> Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic , hooves , and rattling iron-shod wheels . Distant echoes of market-traders shouting . No song . . . A man shouting rhythmic commands ; a counterpoint of grumbling and groans . A single motorcar roared in the distance  --  an unequal place , then . Clanging metal and venting pipes . The hiss and groan of steam engines ; the creak and sway of cranes and pylons and bridges . A distant panicked moan and bellow ; beasts at market ? From all over there was suddenly the shrill of whistles and the low mournful complaint of horns . <br> This is how a city is built . Bit by bit it all locks tight together . When the light comes back the visual world will force itself on him ; in the dark he can build the city himself , from these familiar fragments . He closes his eyes tight . <br> Listen : this is how a city is built from music . <br> <br> There is something missing in it . <br> There was a new noise in the room with him . He pressed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> A hoarse voice rumbled and hissed , in syllables he did n't recognize . It spoke in short staccato monosyllables , then in grinding gutturals and long languid cadences . It was working through languages . Each one had a kind of lulling rhythm , until finally there was a language he understood . Then meaning drove out music  --  but all the voice said was : " It would be courteous if you were to introduce yourself . " <br> He asked , " Is it morning or evening here ? " <br> " I do not know , " it said . " I hoped you might . " <br> " I 'll say good evening then , because it 's dark . I apologize if I <br> have intruded . " <br> " I accept your apology . " <br> The voice was like glass and stones scraping together . A deeper bass and sharper sibilants than any human voice . " The local dialect , " it said , and it sighed like a rattling buzz saw . " Ugly . I 'd hoped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> He was not sure what to say . <br> It spoke again : " May I ask how you came here ? " <br> " I do n't recall . Where is the door ? " <br> " You did not come through the door . You appear to have come down the chimney . " <br> He reached his arm out behind him and felt along the wall . A few feet to his left was a narrow hole , but . . . " It 's barred , " he said . <br> " I know , " the creature rumbled . " Hence my curiosity . " <br> " I do n't know how I came through . " <br> " I hoped you might know of a way out . " <br> " I do n't think so . " <br> " Ah . " The creature sighed . <br> " I think I was being chased , " he said . " Hunted . " <br> It hissed . " It is bad to be chased and hunted . " <br> " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " I expect so . " <br> " Who hunts you ? " <br> " I do n't recall , " he said . " Two men . They chased me all across the city . There was no hiding from them . " <br> " Are you a criminal ? " <br> He thought carefully . " I do n't think so . " <br> " You do not smell like a monster . " <br> " I hope not . " <br> The beast in the cage shifted and the bars rattled . <br> He asked , " May I ask your name ? " <br> The beast exhaled deeply ; its breath smelled of metals , weeds , the sea . " I have no name . My maker gave me none . He kept all the names for himself . May I ask yours ? " <br> " I forget . " <br> " You are a young man of average size and adequate health ; there are many strange smells on you . I will call you Man . " <br> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call you ? " <br> " I am in a cage . You may as well call me Beast . " <br> " Ah . What do you look like ? " <br> The Beast took in a ragged snort of air . " I smell sulfide and <br> phosphor . You have matches on your person . " <br> He patted his clothes . He wore no jacket and his shirt was torn . He wore a silk tie loose around his neck . There were a number of things in his pockets , one of which was a crumpled and nearly empty book of matches . He struck one . ( Quickly and deftly in the darkness  --  he had strong , dexterous musician 's fingers . ) <br> He started and jerked back . A yellow eye the size of a man 's fist reflected the match 's yellow light . It was only a few feet away . The slit of black down the eye 's center clenched tight in the light like the narrow bars of the cage . The creature shifted its head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , green scales and dull ridges . Loose lizard jowls on its thick neck . Its body was long and ridge-backed . It scales were cracked and discolored , its hide was lumpy  --  scarred and stitched ? A fat tail swept the cage and rattled the bars . It was the size of a bull , maybe ? It opened its jaw to show yellow teeth . The match burned out . <br> Rack your brain . What else did you see ? Think . But the visual world was never his strength . The light did not reach to the back of the room , but I think the ceiling was low . I think : no windows . A wooden door to my right . The cage had wheels on its base . The matchbook was red and from the WaneLight Hotel  --  that pretentious capital L curving , priapic , subtly obscene . What else ? <br> <br> " You are a remarkably educated lizard , " he told it . <br> " Thank you . I do not frighten you ? " <br> " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ; I do n't know . You speak very plainly , for a monster . " <br> " You understand me very plainly , for a man . No one else left in these bitter days understands me . I shall have to be more obscure if I wish to awe you . I am the strangest thing on any street of the city for many miles . " <br> " I meant no offense . I 'm sure you are . I 'm well traveled but I have heard of nothing like you . Where in the city are we ? " <br> Was he well traveled ? He thought so . He felt tired ; he carried scars . He remembered nothing . <br> " We are in the Fosdyke Museum of History and Natural Wonders . In its cellars , to be precise . I was an exhibit once , and now I am a prisoner , and soon perhaps they will kill me . There is nothing else like me left in these last days of the city . And I am in a cage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this museum ? " <br> " In Fosdyke , on Holcroft Square . The Museum has stood here for far longer than this Age of the city . Like me it has survived out of its time . We are far from any river or lake and near the lower <br> slopes of the Mountain . " <br> At the word Mountain a fistful of images flashed in his mind , grey-toned flickers like the phantoms of the cinema . Two vague men in hats and shined shoes approaching implacably . A clock tower , the white face darkened by a complex and spiderish excess of hands . Eyes , half-light , pale faces , men stacked like cordwood in a cellar under a spitting bulb . A garden of grey roses . A silent square of ugly statues . Clouds inert in the sky , as if painted ; the birds also still , perfect intricate little china models . ( Wires ? No . ) A tram swaying into a rain-soaked station , shaking as if frightened to stop for him . Gears turning . Time as a trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadows under a dead bulb . A tarnished silver tray bearing sharp and twisted implements . An old , old man looking down from a high window and snarling thief and twitching grey curtains spitefully closed . <br> " I have never left the city , " the creature said . " And perhaps I never will . But I have heard that there are places where madness is associated with the moon  --  that pointless white rock . There is a word : lunatic . Here in Ararat madmen dream of the Mountain . Are you mad ? " <br> " No . I do n't know . How would I know ? Where  --  when are we ? " <br> " These are the last days of the city , " the creature said . " This is where things stagnate . This is where things come to fail and end . <br> Man , are you a failure ? " <br> " Very possibly . At what ? " <br> The lizard shifted on its huge haunches and made a mechanical barking noise that might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you simply Man . It may offend . Will you permit me to name you ? " <br> Continues ...
