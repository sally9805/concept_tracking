Every kid dreams of being a rock star  --  or at least a winner on American Idol  --  but few parents want to endure the cacophony from their very own Sheryl Crow in training . The new HandBand ( $90 ) from KGI Consumer Products offers a cheap alternative . Using nothing more than a high-tech pair of gloves and a portable , wireless receiver , it lets kids play virtual guitar , keyboards or drums at less than earsplitting volume . Each bend of the finger produces a different note ; you switch instruments with the push of a button . It 's a great idea , but the execution needs work . The sound that emerges from the grapefruit-size speaker is passable but a bit synthetic . And the finger contortions required to play the HandBand are so awkward that they 'll discourage all but the most enthusiastic musicians . The air guitar is a lot more fun .  --  A.H .
