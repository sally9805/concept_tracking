Madagascar is sometimes considered a world apart . The fourth-largest island in the world , it is marked by enormous regional diversity . The concept of insular exceptionalism refers not only to a natural environment with outstanding numbers of endemic plants and animals but also to a human history that in various respects contrasts with any other part of Africa. 1 Since Portuguese seafarers first sighted the island in 1500 there had been numerous contacts with Europeans , yet the Malagasy resisted all attempts by the sea powers to establish a foothold until the French invasion of 1895 . The early colonizing efforts , fostered by enthusiastic agents , were in fact marked by a succession of blunders and disasters . An English attempt to create a trading settlement in Saint Augustin , in the southwest of Madagascar , only lasted 18 months , and the French abandoned their Fort Dauphin at the southeastern tip of the island in 1674 , after a troubled existence of 30 years . Both ventures failed , with considerable loss of life , due partly to disease and partly to poor management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to establish longstanding ties with the indigenous population. 2 <p> In the late 17th and early 18th centuries Madagascar became the principal refuge for several hundred European pirates . It is generally assumed that the marauders were more successful than the first colonizers in their dealings with the Malagasy . One scholar has even suggested that access to firearms through pirates and slavers made a significant contribution to the emergence of large-scale kingdoms in various parts of the island. 3 This hypothesis lacks a solid empirical foundation , however . Research on piracy has attracted much attention in the last few years but the relations between the marauders and the indigenous societies in Madagascar , as elsewhere , remain poorly understood . Published accounts of the pirates are by and large anecdotal and do not attempt to explore the context of cross-cultural encounters. 4 A recent trend in historiography to romanticize pirate bands as revolutionaries is not particularly helpful . In fact , piracy can best be understood as an economic phenomenon , and in the Indian Ocean marauders usually operated within commercial networks that included the slave trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Malagasy in the period under consideration , historians can rely on a broad range of sources that are not yet fully appreciated . Unfortunately , the written records offer little more than an impression of the contacts between outsiders and the indigenous population , but in recent years our knowledge of the material culture , trade connections , and settlement structures has increased considerably . Archaeological evidence suggests that small chiefdoms arose throughout the island during the 14th century , and a second stage of political consolidation began in the second half of the 17th century when many chiefdoms in the coastal regions were fused into larger polities. 5 Against this background the various interactions between pirates , slave traders , and the Malagasy populations are of particular interest . The Slave Trade in the Second Half of the 17th Century <p> After European trading companies had established a network of factories in the major port towns of the Indian Ocean , a pattern of shipping emerged in which Madagascar played a marginal role . Most vessels bound for India and the Far East sailed on a southerly route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muscat , Mocha , or Surat principally put into Cape Town and the Comoros , especially at Anjouan . If a crew ran short of water or provisions , vessels also dropped anchor on the west coast of Madagascar . Homebound ships from India normally passed by the southern tip of the island and stopped for provisions at the Cape. 6 Only in dire need did vessels steer for Madagascar , which in part explains the large number of shipwrecks on the inhospitable south coast . While Madagascar was of minor significance for the maritime traffic between Europe and Asia , the island nevertheless became the chief destination of slaving expeditions into the Indian Ocean . <p> Beginning in 1641 the Dutch undertook a number of voyages to ship slaves from Madagascar to their colony on Mauritius . The colony failed to produce sufficient amounts of foodstuff , ambergris , and ebony for export , however , so the trips were abolished in 1647. 7 There were also occasional visits by vessels from the French settlement in the nearby island of Bourbon ( now La Runion ) to acquire cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade remained insignificant until well into the 18th century. 8 <p> When the Dutch refreshment station at the Cape of Good Hope grew into a formidable plantation , a constant demand for manpower emerged . Although slavery had been an integral part of the economy since the early stages of colonization , for a long time there had been no established source of slaves . Links to Madagascar began in 1654 , but the voyages were organized in a haphazard fashion . In the following years the Dutch also made repeated attempts to ship Malagasy slaves to Batavia . In 1687 , however , these connections were discontinued because of high costs and slave mortality. 9 Towards the end of the 17th century a lack of labor was considered the major obstacle to economic growth in the Cape Colony . Thus the trading activities at Madagascar were intensified . In the late 17th century the Dutch dispatched a vessel to Madagascar to procure slaves almost every year. 10 <p> Even though the English did not develop any colonies in the Indian Ocean , they nevertheless became the most active importers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century wholesalers from New York , Boston , and Barbados shipped slaves from Madagascar to the plantations in America , particularly to Jamaica and Barbados . While Dutch vessels usually sailed from the Cape to Madagascar in the latter half of the year and traded there for two to three months , slaving voyages from the New World took about one and a half years . Most slavers set sail in December or January to arrive at Madagascar between June and August . After concluding business the slavers left Madagascar towards the end of the year and were expected back in America between April and June. 11 Despite considerable risks associated with sailing halfway around the globe , Madagascar proved an attractive place to purchase slaves . Although the Royal African Company possessed a monopoly in shipping slaves to the American plantations , the privilege only applied to the Atlantic Ocean . The Indian Ocean lay within the charter limits of the East India Company , which did not ship slaves to the colonies . This legal loophole gave venturesome entrepreneurs an opportunity to set up a profitable trade , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . It has been estimated that , during the period under consideration , it cost only ten shillings in goods to purchase a slave at Madagascar , a sum in sharp contrast to the three to four pounds sterling that had to be paid in West Africa. 12 Thus trading voyages to the Indian Ocean offered an out let for wholesalers operating with flexible business practices and low overheads , which was mainly achieved with small ships and crews . <p> In order to procure slaves , the vessels usually sailed along the west coast of Madagascar , calling at different ports where the commander expected to find favorable trading conditions . The business dealings were often facilitated by wars among the Malagasy people resulting from territorial conflicts or feuds over cattle . The shipwrecked sailor Robert Drury lived nearly 14 years as a slave in various parts of Madagascar before he was eventually picked up by an English vessel . He later became a slaver himself . Looking back on his experiences with the Malagasy , Drury noted : " The epidemical Evil of this Island is , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of them are sold to the Europeans for Slaves . " 13 <p> Dealing with the indigenous population required some experience and a sophisticated bargaining strategy . After the traders had reached a place where they expected to procure slaves , the commander sent a party ashore to inquire whether they could do business . If so , they would present the local ruler with a musket or a pair of pistols . At the beginning of the business dealings the Malagasy occasionally tried to sell weak , female , or elderly slaves , who were not highly valued . If the slaves were refused , further negotiations might have been complicated . Therefore , the Europeans would purchase a number of those slaves and afterwards insist on young males to maximize the profits . Bargaining normally lasted several weeks , demanding a great deal of patience and the right means of exchange. 14 In general , the indigenous people were keen to acquire beads , novelties , and copper or brass wire . Silver coins - the widely used Spanish pieces-of-eight - were also highly valued. 15 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these trade goods were gradually exceeded in importance by muskets . Trade and Exchange in Sainte Marie <p> In order to facilitate the acquisition of slaves , Frederick Philipse , a prominent merchant from New York , sent a party of seven men to Madagascar to establish a trading post . In 1691 the company landed in Sainte Marie , a small and narrow island a few miles off the humid northeastern coast of Madagascar . On the western side of the islet , near the southern end , there is a deep bay with a narrow entry , which forms an excellent harbor. 16 In addition to this attraction , the isolation of Sainte Marie prevented its residents from getting dragged into the conflicts in mainland Madagascar . According to a visitor , there were only some 500 indigenous people living on the island. 17 <p> Under the guidance of Adam Baldridge , who was said to have fled the Caribbean after having committed a murder , the men from America built a hut on a hill at some distance from the harbor . Most members of the company died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Baldridge and a boy referred to as his " apprentice " were still alive . They soon formed an alliance with the population of Sainte Marie by redeeming some wives and children that had been abducted by other Malagasy . Baldridge further deepened his relations with the indigenous people by marrying a local woman. 18 Nevertheless , he did not integrate into Malagasy society , and suspicion was never completely overcome . The most visible sign of the segregation was a small fort that Baldridge built over the years . In 1696 he had an encampment with two or three huts as well as seven or eight guns , and a year later an eyewitness reported that " Baldridge had set some Stoccadoes about his own houses to keep off the Negroes and had twelve or fourteen small Guns . " 19 <p> For a few years slavers from the colonies flocked to the trading post , where Baldridge acted as Philipse 's agent and served as an intermediary between the merchants and the Malagasy . Yet the number of slaves available in the northeast of Madagascar was very limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually ransomed back to their families . As early as 1693 Baldridge had problems procuring enough slaves to ensure that Philipse 's ships made a profitable voyage. 20 Thus , in subsequent years , American slavers increasingly sailed to ports on the west coast of Madagascar where they found more favorable trading conditions . <p> Over the last decade of the 17th century Sainte Marie became a prime destination for European pirates . Beginning around 1685 a number of marauders from the Caribbean made their way to the Arabian Sea . Their target was a richly laden pilgrim fleet that sailed annually from Surat in India to Mocha and Jeddah on the Arabian Peninsula . After raiding the Indians the pirates usually steered for Sainte Marie to repair their ships , restock provisions , and divide the loot . They then made their way back to the New World . The number of sea rovers increased considerably after 1689 , when the colonial authorities issued privateering commissions to treasure hunters . In 1695 , however , many marauders failed to acquire the desired booty . Most of them decided to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets . In the next few years more vessels from the American colonies joined them . As the governor of New York noted : " the vast riches of the Red Sea and Madagascar are such a lure for Seamen that theres almost no withholding them from that vile practice of Turning pyrates. " 21 Thus , from about 1695 to 1700 , the Indian Ocean was the principal center of pirate activity and up to 1,500 marauders plied the eastern seas , In search of easy prey , many of them sailed to the narrow entrance of the port of Surat , to Cape Comorin at the southern tip of India , or as far as the Malacca Strait . Between their raids , the rovers sooner or later visited Sainte Marie , which became a crucial juncture between legal trading ventures and outright piracy. 22 <p> In Sainte Marie marauders careened and repaired their vessels , recovered from scurvy and the strains of shipboard life , and traded spoils for provisions , naval stores , ammunition , clothing , and other commodities . Most of the supplies came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provided the pirates with the desired wares. 23 A constant flow of supplies enabled the rovers to commit further raids and expand their activities . Moreover , an easy access to the markets of the North Atlantic meant that the marauders could sell bulky goods such as spices , drugs , and exotic textiles that otherwise were not worth carrying over a long distance back to America . <p> Since the pirates required large amounts of provisions , they relied heavily on foodstuffs that could be procured on the spot . Baldridge helped the marauders purchase ample supplies of cattle and fowl from the indigenous population . In the absence of other staples the pirates also learned to appreciate rice , which was cultivated in many coastal regions . Rice was generally cheap , easy to store , and did not perish on long-distance voyages . In exchange the Malagasy received pirate booty - particularly dyed textiles from India , which were much sought after - as well as manufactures , coinage , glass beads , and copper rings. 24 <p> It appears , however , that this material exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The division between the pirates and the indigenous people continued to exist throughout the history of the entrept . In October 1697 Baldridge left Sainte Marie for a trip along the coast to acquire slaves to be shipped to Bourbon . While he was at sea , the small colony at Sainte Marie was overthrown by the indigenous population . Eleven marauders were killed ; only a ship boy survived the massacre . According to this boy , the pirates had provoked the assault " by their abuseing of the Natives and takeing their Cattel from them . " 25 This incident indicates that the pirates had failed to develop respect for the Malagasy . In the absence of a mediator , the locals retaliated swiftly by killing the malefactors . <p> After Baldridge had learned about the massacre , he left Madagascar and sailed back to America . A few months later a certain Edward Welch took over as the resident trader in Sainte Marie . Under his guidance commerce with the pirates reached its peak . In 1698 three pirate vessels , including William Kidd 's decrepit Adventure Galley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time nearly three hundred sailors stayed on the small island . Many of them had acquired enormous amounts of booty and were eager to enjoy their gains . They traded a considerable part of their spoil for provisions and liquor that two vessels from New York had brought to Madagascar . Early in 1699 , when the supplies were used up , the community of marauders began to disintegrate . The men probably feared that the Royal Navy would dispatch vessels to destroy the entrept . Some pirates decided to return to America as passengers on slaving vessels. 27 Those who had not made the desired booty as well as the ones who had gambled their spoil away had no alternative but to participate in other raids , even though it was getting increasingly difficult to capture Indian vessels . Cross-Cultural Relations in the South of Madagascar <p> Another important haven for pirates was Saint Augustin , the site of the attempted English colony on the southwestern coast . Situated at the mouth of the Onilahy River , it was protected by a large sandbar on which the crews usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refill their water supplies . Due to its favorable position near the shipping lane from the South Atlantic to the Arabian Sea , Saint Augustin was one of the most frequented ports in Madagascar . During the latter half of the 17th century the indigenous population of the bay area , which was known as the Fiherena , became accustomed to dealing with European seafarers . They established a barter economy based on the supplying of ships with foodstuffs in exchange for beads , brass , copper , pieces-of-eight , and firearms. 28 <p> From the early 1690s pirates dominated the trade at Saint Augustin , and merchant vessels generally avoided calling there . The marauders frequently set up camps in which the men suffering from scurvy restored their health , but no permanent establishment . During their stay the pirates were primarily engaged in purchasing and salting beef , which usually took months rather than weeks . The contacts occasionally led to conflicts . For instance , it was reported that a European had been killed in a dispute between drunk pirates and some locals . A few years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pirates quarreled and behaved badly. 29 Nevertheless , cross-cultural relations centered around business dealings , and the indigenous population made the best of the pirates ' presence by forcing up the price of cattle. 30 <p> In the long run , the inhabitants of Saint Augustin probably increased their wealth as a result of the trading relations with Europeans . However , there appears to be no indication that exchange had a profound effect on the economic structure of the semiarid bay area or its social organization. 31 Surviving evidence suggests that the pastoral people of the region did not make effective use of their trade relations with the outside world . Much material wealth acquired from the Europeans was , according to southern Malagasy tradition , buried with the dead or in sacred forests and did not stimulate trade with the hinterland. 32 This habit is reflected in the rich funerary offerings , mostly imported from overseas , that have been excavated near Saint Augustin . Radiocarbon dating has revealed that the items were exchanged over a long period , beginning in or around 1630 and lasting until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that imported goods were distributed among clients to generate or maintain ties of political allegiance . <p> It appears that the Andriavola , the royal dynastic lineage of the Fiherena , had not yet successfully assimilated all the different groups of the region by the turn of the century . The land was divided into numerous territories , each of which was ruled by a king or his sons and nephews , While the king lived in a capital village , his male relatives were petty nobles who ruled their own separate villages . This power structure with different but more or less equal political units was very instable . Alliances between local rulers shifted frequently , and conflicts were endemic. 34 The entire region suffered from political fragmentation and repeated wars with powerful neighbors . According to the governor of Fort Dauphin , the area around Saint Augustin was ravaged by wars around the middle of the 17th century. 35 During the pirate era the most fertile part of the country was still largely depopulated , and the remaining inhabitants seldom dared to leave their fortified villages . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often raided each other 's villages to steal cattle as well as slaves . Such raids were highly discriminate and organized activities , which led to numerous feuds. 36 It seems likely that frequent skirmishes and internecine warfare used up many resources and thus hindered the economic development of the Fiherena . Against this background efforts to meet the demand of European seafarers for additional livestock could have been destructive rather than beneficial . <p> On several occasions pirates participated in cattle raids . In 1697 , for example , the crew of the Pelican , in dire need of provisions , arrived at Saint Augustin . Unable to pay the asking price for cattle , the commander sent a party of 25 armed men ashore to help Rabefaha raid " his Enemy . " After a successful expedition the ship 's company was rewarded with half the booty , mainly consisting of cattle. 37 The indigenous lite evidently came to appreciate the martial skills that the pirates brought with them . The adventurer and circumnavigator William Dampier reported that , as early as 1689 or 1690 , a band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustin , in a campaign against his neighbors. 38 Years later a sailor who had spent some time as a captive of pirates in Madagascar noted : " If one English Man goes with the Prince where he lives to Warr , he hath hlfe the Slaves that are taken for his paines. " 39 These references indicate that such temporary alliances were frequent occurrences around the turn of the century . <p> According to the History of the Pyrates , the employment of sailors played a crucial role in Malagasy warfare . The author asserts : " of such Reputation are the Europeans among these People , for they who have a white Man on their Side go on as to certain Victory , and the Sight of a white Man against them is such a Damp to their Spirits , that despairing of Success , they are preparing for Flight before they engage . " 40 Even if this statement is exaggerated and inspired by a sense of cultural superiority , it suggests that it was not so much the use of firearms but the simple appearance of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was based on past experiences . The people of southern Madagascar were well acquainted with the deadly effects of the use of muskets after French soldiers had First intervened in indigenous conflicts in 1646 . Three years later , when provisions ran short in Fort Dauphin , French musketeers helped the Mahafaly in their war against the Masikoro for a fee of half the cattle taken in the campaign. 41 Until the abandonment of their colony , the French continued to dispatch troops into war against various ethnic groups . Pirates evidently built on these connections when they participated in cattle raids in the last decade of the 17th century . By so doing , they may have exacerbated existing conflicts , causing further instability in the region . Eventually , around 1712 , at a time when no vessel had called at Saint Augustin for years , the area was overrun by a combined army consisting of Sakalava and Mahafaly warriors . <p> The remarkable career of Abraham Samuel is another well-documented example of how Europeans were incorporated into indigenous politics . A mulatto from Martinique , Samuel had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirate vessel John and Rebecca . After the ship 's company had been decimated by disease , the men sailed along the southeast coast of Madagascar to procure slaves . In October 1697 , when the ship lay at anchor off Fort Dauphin , a storm cut the cables and the crew was shipwrecked . The men found shelter in the ruins of the abandoned fort . There an elderly princess ostensibly identified Samuel as her child , last seen in 1674 when he had been taken away by his French father . All of a sudden Samuel found himself proclaimed king of a small territory inhabited by the Tanosy. 42 One can only speculate about the background of this fantastic story . It seems that the shipwrecked party was supposed to serve as reinforcement either in internal disputes among the indigenous people or in a more comprehensive territorial conflict . <p> In any event , Samuel made the most of his luck and took the title " King of Port Dolfphin , Tollannare , Farrawe , Fanquestt , Fownzahira in Madagascar . " 43 And yet it seems that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bodyguard consisting of some 20 heavily armed marauders stayed with him . Despite such suspicion , life among the Tanosy must have appeared so attractive that 25 retired pirates abandoned their plan to go back to America and joined Samuel early in 1699 . There the men continued their piratical ways . At least three trading vessels that had called at Fort Dauphin were taken by surprise and looted to the keel . Samuel subsequently sold one of these prizes for 1,400 pieces-of-eight to another company of pirates. 44 <p> Besides ample supplies of silver , such raids brought a variety of highly valued goods into the possession of the indigenous population . Some of these imports , such as iron pots , had a lasting impact on the material culture of the Tanosy. 45 <p> The pirates also took an active part in warfare . In the latter half of 1705 , for example , King Samuel led his army in a campaign against a neighboring petty kingdom . At that time he was already in bad health , and two months later he apparently died . Samuel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The pirates never integrated into society and most if not all of them vanished shortly after Samuel 's death. 46 The ultimate fate of these men is not documented . <p> In April 1703 the leaky Degrave sank on the reef-fringed coast of the extreme south of Madagascar . Nearly all men and women onboard , about 170 people , managed to get ashore and were taken by some locals to a fortified capital of the Tandroy . There the shipwrecked party learned from eight other castaways that they would never be allowed to leave . Since the Europeans needed to get to a harbor to be picked up by a vessel , they took the king , Dian Crindo , hostage and began to walk eastward towards Fort Dauphin . About 2,000 warriors followed them . When the Europeans eventually realized that they would not reach Fort Dauphin , they surrendered to their pursuers . In the end most of them were killed . Only a group of 30 men who had previously slipped away from the main company escaped the massacre. 47 The conduct of the Tandroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . Dian Crindo apparently feared that the castaways might join King Samuel 's forces , helping him to attain hegemony in southeastern Madagascar . To prevent this threat from materializing , the Tandroy had to keep the sailors in their realm . After the king had been released from the humiliating captivity , killing all strangers presumably became a question of honor . The Europeans , frightened in a strange and hostile environment , did not understand these circumstances . Such mismatching of cultural logics undoubtedly cost the lives of many outsiders in Madagascar . Firearms , Slaves , and the Rise of the Sakalava of Boina <p> During the second half of the 17th century a political transformation to an extent previously unknown in Madagascar enveloped the forested valleys and savannas north of Saint Augustin . In the course of this process numerous small and self-contained chiefdoms were replaced by two powerful Sakalava kingdoms . As in other parts of Africa , a system of divine kingship evolved. 48 Although the power of the emerging polity was based at least initially on the capture and exploitation of pastoral riches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europeans . According to oral tradition , the introduction of firearms by Lahifotsy played a decisive role in a battle that laid the foundation of his subsequent rule over Menabe , the region near the central west coast . The true essence of this legend is confirmed by the fact that ten original muskets were preserved as relics until the late 19th century. 49 It seems possible that , between 1668 and 1683 , the Sakalava repeatedly advanced to Saint Augustin because they tried to get access to a source for these new weapons . These attempts , however , were abandoned after Lahifotsy 's death , which led to dynastic struggles . Shortly thereafter Simanato , his youngest son , left Menabe in a dispute with his brothers . It was reported that he had taken " all the riches and Stores of war of his father " with him. 50 Substantially weakened by this loss , the rulers of Menabe were probably not able to wage any expansionist wars for many years . <p> Simanato meanwhile set out to found his own kingdom . Accompanied by ritual specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched to Masselege in the northwest. 51 Here Islamized traders had established a vibrant market for slaves , making the region a prime destination for vessels from America and the Cape Colony . The principal trading center during the 17th century was located on the small island of Antsoheribory in the Bay of Boina . Since the late 16th century the area had been an independent principality , which maintained close cultural and commercial links to the Swahili coast . Perhaps as many as 2,000 to 3,000 slaves were exported each year. 52 It appears that Simanato attacked the area in a ruthless fashion , spreading fear and terror . In 1686 slavers found Antsoheribory burned and deserted while the area around the Bay of Bombetoka , east of the Bay of Boina , was being conquered by the Sakalava army , and a few years later the entire coastal region was ruled by Simanato. 53 <p> The destruction of Masselege was probably part of a strategy aimed at transforming the political economy of northwestern Madagascar . After the close of war Simanato set up his capital in Marovoay on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay of Bombetoka with the central highlands . This location was relatively inaccessible for attackers from overseas - apparently the only force that Simanato feared - and it enabled the Sakalava kings to control the export trade in slaves. 54 During this formative period Europeans were especially welcomed by Simanato , not only as traders but also as advisors . In 1694 a Norwegian sailor helped the Sakalava rulers in their business dealings with slavers , and from about 1695 a Dutchman stayed with Simanato. 55 Even though the profits of external trade did not constitute the foundations of royal power , they provided a strong reinforcement for royal prestige . In the first half of the 18th century visitors were impressed by the material prosperity of the Sakalava court . There were fortified houses containing all sorts of imported wares , and a merchant noted that the king " has a Fort of Earth built or thrown up according to the European Method , where he has between 30 and 40 large Guns mounted . " 56 <p> In 1695 or 1696 warfare entered a new phase when Simanato 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal region , and the Vazimba , a distinct group living in dispersed settlements in the interior . Within a few years the Sakalava of Boina conquered a vast area , covering most of northwestern Madagascar. 57 As a result of Simanato 's rapid advancement , thousands of captives went into slavery and were brought to the Sakalava ports to be shipped overseas . By imposing a royal monopoly on the trade in slaves , Simanato made effective use of relations with the outside world . During the war the Sakalava refused to accept any means of exchange other than firearms . This policy caused problems for the Dutch , who were not able to ship large numbers of muskets to Madagascar. 58 For American whole-salers , on the other hand , manufactures proved an attractive export , as specie was always scarce in the colonies . Thus American merchants liberally supplied the Sakalava with muskets . Surviving cargo lists , for example , indicate that each of the four vessels that left New York for Madagascar in 1698 had more than a hundred trade guns on board. 59 <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Bays of Boina and Bombetoka , even though it appears that slaves could have been purchased cheaper elsewhere on the west coast of Madagascar . The well-established market structures and the steady supply in the north probably accelerated the business dealings , which might have outweighed higher prices . Nevertheless , the export trade in slaves relied to a large degree on external factors . After the outbreak of war on the Swahili coast in 1696 , for example , no Arab vessel called at the Sakalava ports for more than two years. 60 Furthermore , as a part of a campaign against piracy launched in 1698 , the English authorities cut off trading links with Madagascar , and only a few interlopers continued to visit the island. 61 Dutch traders experienced problems with high death rates among the slaves . It seems likely that many captives from the highlands contracted malaria on their way to the coast and died later in the course of the voyage . Beginning in 1705 Dutch slaving vessels steered primarily for the southern ports of Madagascar. 62 As a consequence , the overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century were purchased by Swahili traders . <p> The circumstances suggest that the trade of slaves for firearms transformed the Sakalava into a formidable military power and contributed to their rapid expansion . However , the history of warfare in Africa indicates that , when it came to actual combat , traditional spears generally proved more reliable and effective than imported muskets . Although the introduction of the flintlock brought some improvements , firearms remained inefficient and frequently failed in action . An eyewitness , for instance , noted that the muskets sold to the indigenous population were of such poor quality that they often exploded , maiming or killing those who used them. 63 It therefore seems likely that the use of guns had a more complex background . In parts of Madagascar muskets were considered sacred , imbued with hasina , a magic force that connects the living with dead ancestors . Research on the rise of the Merina in the late 18th century has revealed that this symbolic power of muskets was successfully exploited by their leaders when they laid the foundation of their subsequent rule over most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small Sakalava army in warfare is striking . The Vazimba , for example , surrendered within a brief period , and many Antalaotse had retreated to the island of Antsoheribory before they were eventually subjugated. 65 It is not clear what role firearms played in these assaults . However , Simanato 's desire to control the import of muskets and their use in rituals suggest that a spiritual force such as hasina might have already played a role in the late 17th century , giving the Sakalava army a boost in warfare . It seems likely that the introduction of firearms in northwestern Madagascar , similar to the situation in the south , primarily destroyed the confidence of opposing warriors , who , after the first encounters with Simanato 's musketeers , took refuge in flight or surrendered without offering much resistance . <p> One key to the rise of the Sakalava kingdoms lay in the fact that their leaders managed to incorporate imported technology and skills into a traditional sociocultural framework . Like other divine kings , Simanato centralized the redistribution of muskets and cattle , which constituted much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearms as intimidating weapons was a significant element in establishing Sakalava dominance over most of western Madagascar , it seems that royal cattle riches - the spoils of war - were subsequently the main bond holding together an extensive clientele . Both the rulers of Menabe and Boina kept large herds of cattle with which they rewarded their subjects and enticed other people to live under their rule. 66 Apart from these arrangements , other indigenous factors may have contributed to the rise of the Sakalava kingdoms , but very little is documented about the internal structure of these polities in the early stages of their development . In the absence of historical records , much remains to be unearthed by archaeologists . The End of the Pirate Era <p> Around the turn of the century there was an increasing number of clashes between pirates and slavers on the Madagascar coast . Probably the first English vessel that fell victim to a pirate attack was the Beckford Galley , which was seized near Saint Augustin in June 1699 . Later in the same year pirates took two sloops that had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions , and more vessels followed in the succeeding years. 67 All ships were seized by pirates who had previously lost their vessels due to mishaps or decaying hulls . For some time the pirates could replace leaky ships with new ones from the American colonies . By the turn of the century , however , the maritime traffic between the New World and Madagascar was reduced to insignificance. 68 As a result of a lack of supplies and seaworthy vessels , the emphasis of pirate activity shifted from the open seas to the Madagascar coast . <p> In November 1703 two English warships that had been dispatched to hunt down the remaining pirates cruised off the east coast of Madagascar . At several places the commanders sent their boats ashore to inquire whether there were any rovers . The sailors spotted a few white men , but they found no indication of any ongoing pirate activity. 69 At that time numerous marauders lingered about the island . In March 1705 the governing council of the Cape Colony summarized various reports on conditions in Madagascar . It was reckoned that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they enjoyed the protection of local rulers . Three years later a French visitor estimated that there were still 400 pirates living in Madagascar. 70 Even though these figures are clearly inflated , there can be no doubt that a considerable number of marauders had taken refuge within the indigenous population . While some of these men were seeking an opportunity to return to the western hemisphere , others tried to find a new living far away from the societies they had left behind . <p> Several retired pirates established a new source of income and became intermediaries in the slave trade . They were accustomed to dealing with the Malagasy and provided valuable knowledge of market conditions . Perhaps the most successful figure in this business was a Dutchman named John Pro . In November 1703 he had been captured but managed to escape to Mohli three months later . At that time the Comoro Islands served as a prime refuge for pirates , and Mayotte was said to be entirely controlled by marauders. 71 A few years later , when the Sakalava of Boina were raiding the central highlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He obviously managed a profitable business , as Drury observed in 1716 that he lived " in a very handsome Manner . " Pro had a few houses , many cattle , and several slaves . At times he was assisted by other former pirates. 72 <p> After the trading network of piracy had collapsed many marauders tried to integrate into Malagasy society . It seems reasonable to assume that most of them died of illness and disease within a short time . When the privateer and circumnavigator Woodes Rogers visited the Cape Colony in 1710 , he learned from two former pirates " that those miserable Wretches , who had made such a Noise in the World , were now dwindled to between 60 and 70 , most of them very poor and despicable , even to the Natives , among whom they had married . " 73 Unfortunately , very little is documented about the lives of the surviving pirates . When Drury wandered from the far south of Madagascar to Morondava , the principal port of the Sakalava of Menabe , between approximately 1710 and 1715 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous population . Among them were a Dutch sailor left behind in Madagascar at his own request and two former slaves from the American colonies who had previously served on pirate vessels . From Drury 's descriptions there appears to be no indication that the everyday life of these renegades differed in any way from the other members of their communities. 74 The fact that one of these men was speared to death after having challenged the local ruler , however , indicates that the process of acculturation was long , difficult , and not always successful . <p> The establishment of family ties through marriage was likely the crucial factor that led to the integration of outsiders into Malagasy society . Traditionally , marriage has been an institution designed to form or confirm strategic alliances of people within their own communities as well as between different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. 75 With the arrival of pirates , who proved to be highly opportunistic , such relations gained a new dimension . For the indigenous population the reception of these men promised access to sophisticated technical skills and offered the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only helped outsiders assimilate into Malagasy society but it also brought about a noticeable creolization , particularly in the northern sections of the east coast , which comprised a narrow strip split into segments by numerous rivers rushing down from a steep escarpment . This region was populated by people living in nucleated villages and hamlets aggregated under the rule of chiefs called filohany. 76 <p> The integration of a considerable number of pirates into these eastern coastal communities was the result of a remarkable transition . Around the turn of the century , when Sainte Marie was abandoned and several pirate crews sought alternative ports for provisioning , cross-cultural relations were marked by conflicts and violent clashes . A visitor learned from locals that the pirates used to steal foodstuffs from the Malagasy . According to this narrative , marauders committed atrocities against the indigenous population , burning their villages or destroying their houses with gunfire if they failed to supply the robbers with provisions. 77 After having lost their vessel , a gang of pirates supposedly set up a small fort to defend themselves against hostile locals . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked Lives , stealing away , and ravishing the Wives and Daughters of the Natives , living by this Means , in a State of continual War . " 78 At this stage bloody encounters involving marauders seem to have been regular occurrences on the eastern littoral . <p> In the course of the first decade of the 18th century a fundamental change occurred , and an increasing number of pirates entered into alliances with the Malagasy . When the prospects of easy loot faded and vessels had to be given up , most crews dispersed and the men sought their fortune in various coastal villages. 79 During this period the Europeans and the indigenous population gradually overcame cultural differences and learned to profit from each other . The Malagasy gained access to material wealth and advanced martial skills , while the rovers found a place of refuge , faraway from the rule of law . It seems that only at this stage did pirates develop respect for the indigenous people and begin to accept their traditions , customs , and values . The fact that the sailors appeared as individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their cultural identity was crucial to the integration of these outsiders into Malagasy society . <p> In order to establish intercultural relations for mutual benefit , pirates were frequently offered daughters of the ruling families for temporary unions or as wives . As a result , marauders attained leading positions in a number of coastal communities within a short period. 80 Both those who settled in Madagascar and others who consorted with indigenous women during briefer stays on the island fathered numerous children who were known as malata . Even though they never formed a cohesive group , the malata were to play an important role in the history of the northern parts of the eastern littoral. 81 <p> Pirates also had an impact on the material culture of some coastal villages . At several places archaeologists have excavated imported items datable to the late 17th and early 18th centuries. 82 There is even linguistic evidence that connects the material culture of a few settlements with the pirates . Various objects , such as large jars , have names that can be traced back to English origins . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European boatbuilding tradition of barks with clinker-built hulls and multiple masts , which may go back to the age of the pirates. 83 In any case , the cultural transfer was not of major significance , and there is no evidence for a widespread diffusion of innovation . <p> The relative material wealth the pirates brought into the region attracted the powerful Tsikoa from the south who frequently raided their northern neighbors . Around 1712 disparate communities living on the narrow stretch of coast in the area facing Sainte Marie began to organize themselves against the Tsikoa . Their leader was a young molata named Ratsimilaho . He was said to have been the son of an English pirate known as Tamo , or Tom , and a princess who had formerly been expelled from her lands. 84 It appears that the prospect of reclaiming ancestral lands with the possible support of Europeans enabled Ratsimilaho to assemble a cohesive force , consisting of up to 12,000 warriors . In the following years the so-called Betsimisaraka confederation gradually gained control of the primary ports . Eventually , in 1716 , Ratsimilho 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who became known as the Betanimena during the war ) , and laid the foundation for his subsequent rule of the northeastern coast . A study of the decisive siege reveals that the military success of the Betsimisaraka was due to a superior strategy that took advantage of the inflexibility of traditional Malagasy warfare . Instead of laying siege to Fenoarivo until the Betanimena surrendered , Ratsimilaho divided his forces in a way never before witnessed in indigenous conflicts . While some musketeers prevented the defenders from manning their posts , others took the offensive lines. 85 Shortly thereafter Fenoarivo was in the hands of the Betsimisaraka . <p> Surviving evidence suggests that pirates had close ties to Ratsimilaho 's army . According to an oral tradition , however , marauders generally avoided direct engagement in combat . The men were said to have supported the Betsimisaraka by exclusively selling them muskets . An attempt of the Betanimena to acquire a shipload of firearms apparently turned out to be a trap , which further weakened their military strength. 86 The conflicts on the east coast of Madagascar were watched attentively by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1716 learned from locals that pirates " have the Command of the Natives for 60 or 70 Leagues along the Shore . " 87 These references seem to imply that Ratsimilaho 's military success owed more to strategic skills that the marauders brought into the region than to the introduction of firepower . Muskets indeed served status or ritual purposes and were often carried as ornaments rather than as deadly weapons. 88 <p> Despite the fact that the war generated a considerable number of captives , the Betsimisaraka did not manage to profit from the export of slaves until well after the close of hostilities . Prior to 1724 the ports of the east coast had been virtually cut off from colonial markets , as there were few if any visits from slave vessels . Encounters with pirates had led to the loss of several trading vessels around the turn of the century , so in the following years slavers avoided this region. 89 Moreover , there were few protected anchorages along the coast . As a consequence , after the arrival of the pirates , contacts with the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 18th century most people on the eastern littoral continued to live in largely autonomous villages . The results of archaeological survey show that there were few changes in pottery traditions and little evidence for trade , social differentiation , or a developed settlement hierarchy.90 Even though these findings reaffirm that the dominant polity was founded by a single charismatic individual rather than through gradual structural changes , Ratsimilaho never assumed the divine and absolute powers of kingship as practiced among the Sakalava . The Betsimisaraka remained essentially a confederation of independent communities , led by powerful filohany , rather than a united kingdom . <p> Towards the middle of the 18th century Betsimisaraka sovereignty was threatened by the trading interests of the French who began to ship slaves , mainly taken from raids on the interior of Madagascar , to the plantations of Bourbon and Mauritius , then called Ile de France . Throughout this phase some zanamalata , offspring of the ruling malaia , consolidated their leading positions in the major ports by serving as intermediaries in the slave trade.91 Although the trading centers were increasingly dominated by outsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the present day . Concluding Remarks <p> During the late 17th and early 18th centuries relatively few pirates and slavers exerted noticeable influence in various coastal regions of Madagascar . Nevertheless , the effects of European culture on indigenous societies by and large resulted from the ability of the Malagasy people to make effective use of their relations with the outside world and to modernize certain key elements of their social and military organization . The introduction of muskets as intimidating weaponry probably helped the Sakalava to expand their territory over most of western Madagascar and to establish the first large-scale kingdoms . Fragmentary evidence seems to indicate that the Betsimisaraka profited from the martial skills that the pirates brought with them . The rise of both polities was based on a complex interaction of external and indigenous factors , and in both cases able and ambitious leaders successfully combined imported technology and skills with Malagasy traditions and customs . <p> The incorporation of wealth and power from European sources clearly bolstered local hierarchies , but the degree of social differentiation and the exercise of power through state authority remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ephemeral and without a permanent presence in parts of western and northwestern Madagascar . Furthermore , the political entities turned out to be unstable , breaking down into smaller units with competing courts when the central power came under pressure from outside. 92 The Betsimisaraka managed to establish only a loose confederation , which quickly disintegrated after Ratsimilaho 's death in 1750 . It is generally assumed that the first durable Malagasy state was created by the Merina in the central highlands , in part as a defense against slave raids from the coastal areas. 93 <p> Despite several shipping disruptions in the period under study , the commercial geography of Madagascar was slowly transformed by its integration into the colonial trading network of the western Indian Ocean. 94 Over the course of this development the export of slaves became a predominant feature of indigenous societies in many parts of Madagascar , at tremendous cost for countless men , women , and children . <p> * The author would like to thank Gerald Berg , Stephen Ellis , Nol Gueunier , John Lamphear , Pier Larson , Malyn Newitt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright for their useful suggestions on earlier drafts .
