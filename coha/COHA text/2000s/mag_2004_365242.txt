Traders blamed the bitter dispute at Russian oil giant Yukos for propelling crude prices to record levels last week . But what 's less clear is how a company that produces just 2% of the earth 's oil supply can trigger a worldwide hike in the price of September crude , which reached $44.60 a barrel on Friday . <P> The answer lies as much in psychology as in economics . " There 's not a lot of logic to the move that oil has had , " says Jeff Kleintop , chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors , noting that a tepid U.S. jobs report last Friday raises the specter of a decelerating economy , which would cut demand for oil . Indeed , share prices of U.S. refiners like Sunoco and ConocoPhillips tumbled even further than the overall market did last week . <P> But the Yukos political melodrama is hard to ignore . The Russian government is seeking to collect $6.8 billion in back taxes from Yukosan effort that has threatened to send the company into bankruptcy . That prospect is highly unlikely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's oil could loom large if it were disrupted even temporarily , which would surely push prices higher . Nor does the Kremlin appear to have any qualms about roiling the world 's oil markets as the battle with Yukos drags on . " The people who are masterminding the assault on Yukos simply do not take such economic factors into account , " says Alexei Kondaurov , a former top Yukos executive . A Moscow court last Friday overruled the Kremlin 's seizure of Yukos ' core production unit . The government 's strategy is to " play a cat-and-mouse game with the company " to drive down its market value and hope to buy its oil assets on the cheap , asserts Mikhail Krutikhin , an analyst at consultant RusEnergy . Oil users across the globe are trapped in the game too . <P>  --  By Daniel Kadlec . With reporting by Yuri Zarakhovich
