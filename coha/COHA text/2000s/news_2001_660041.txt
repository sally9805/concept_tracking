<p> In July 1993 , President Clinton was in Tokyo attending a G-7 summit when CNN footage of the deadly Serb siege of Sarajevo flashed across his television screen , deeply troubling him . It was not the first time TV images of the Bosnia conflict had stirred anguish in the new president , who later confided to reporters that he was " very upset by the shelling of Sarajevo . " Often , during morning briefings in the Oval Office , Clinton would wince when Bosnia came up . " There were occasional explosions of anger , for good reason , " recalls then-National Security Advisor Anthony Lake . In Tokyo , Clinton 's gut reaction prompted him to call for bold action in the Balkans . He directed his advisers to lay out US options - including military action - for halting the brutal ethnic cleansing . But before long , the president 's anxiety over Bosnia once again gave way to concerns about falling into a foreign quagmire . The result : No armed intervention occurred at that time . It was n't until two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-week campaign of airstrikes that pushed Bosnian Serbs to accept a cease-fire and attend talks in Dayton , Ohio . " There was a sense of malaise , " says Ivo Daalder , a National Security Council ( NSC ) staff expert in 1995 and 1996 who is now at the Brookings Institution . " A sense that the inability of the United States , this mighty superpower , to deal with the horror in Bosnia was having a detrimental affect on US credibility . " From Bosnia to Haiti , Iraq to Kosovo , Clinton 's hesitant use of force is an important yet controversial legacy of his presidency . It speaks to perhaps the central dilemma of American foreign policy in the post-cold-war era : The United States has unrivaled military and economic power , but when should it use it ? In short , it has superpower status , but to what end ? For Commander in Chief Clinton in the 1990s , experts and officials say , there was an ongoing tension between the desire to exert influence abroad and the price he was willing to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor of international affairs at Harvard University in Cambridge , Mass. , was to limit risks and costs in terms of US " blood and treasure . " As a result , " economic sanctions and airstrikes by unmanned cruise missiles have become the preferred tools of US diplomacy . " In terms of numbers , Clinton has ordered American armed involvement in more theaters than any other recent president . In Iraq and Somalia , he continued US engagements begun under the previous administration . He also approved actions in Haiti , Bosnia , the Sudan and Afghanistan , and Kosovo . And all indications are that the incoming Bush administration considers the Clinton team too activist in its approach to military engagement . The " Powell doctrine , " named after Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell , holds that the United States should deploy its military only when its national interests are at stake - and then only with overwhelming force , an all-out plan to win , and a clear exit strategy . In contrast , the Clinton administration set out few clear guidelines for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted what then-UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright called a " case-by-case " approach , which some experts see as a pragmatic response to a complex world , but others criticize as incoherent and vulnerable to short-term political pressures . This stirred heated debate both within Clinton 's government and the broader foreign-policy community . Genocide and other humanitarian crises - threats not necessarily directly tied to US strategic interests - became possible justifications for US intervention . But as the terrain for US armed engagement widened , Clinton remained reluctant to use force . From the beginning , the president , who evaded service in the Vietnam War , showed a discomfort in his role of commander in chief . The failed peacekeeping mission in Somalia , where more than a dozen US Army Rangers were killed in street battles in Mogadishu in 1993 , left Clinton even more averse to any risk of American casualties , close advisers say . Even some of Clinton 's supporters voice concern that America has not lived up to its global responsibilities , giving it the reputation of a " hollow hegemon , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the position of a poker player who has a very large number of chips on the table in front of him , and then does not use them in the game , " says Mr. Lake , now a Georgetown University professor . To be relevant to the world and its many internal conflicts , we must be willing , he says , to supply more troops for peacekeeping operations . Other top Clinton foreign-policy officials agree . " If I had to sum up my greatest concern about American foreign policy today , " UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the Financial Times recently , " it 's the gap between our rhetoric and our resources . " " We keep proclaiming lofty goals , and then not putting up enough resources to achieve them , " says Mr. Holbrooke , who brokered the 1995 Dayton peace accord on Bosnia . A reluctant commander ?

While critics take him to task for not acting more decisively , he ordered the armed forces into more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matured in his military role - growing " more crisp , more confident , more at ease , " Lake says - the waffling over when to use force continued . Repeatedly , turning points in conflicts came only belatedly , when the United States threatened to use ground troops . In Bosnia , Clinton did not make the decisive threat of unilateral US action , including the use of ground troops , until the summer of 1995 . By then , the massacres and atrocities were so bad that Clinton political guru Dick Morris urged him to act , since the conflict was starting to damage him politically at home . There were also complete failures to act , as Clinton later acknowledged , such as in Rwanda , where inter-tribal genocide in 1994 left some 800,000 people dead and drove another 2 million from their homes . Clinton himself acknowledges thrift in the use of US might abroad , although he casts it in a positive light . In a major foreign policy address at the University of Nebraska last month , Clinton stressed how little America is spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , at a time when we are the world 's only superpower , with the strongest economy in the world , less than 1 in every 800 United Nations peacekeepers is an American - less than 1 in 800 . Less than 2 percent of our men and women in uniform are involved in ongoing military operations abroad of any kind , " he told the audience . Ticking off examples of limited US military roles from Bosnia to Ecuador , East Timor to Sierra Leone , Clinton emphasized that " if we 're just involved a little bit , we can make a huge difference . " Moreover , he said , " nobody in the world benefits more from stability than we do , nobody . Nobody makes more money out of it - just think about pure , naked self-interest - nobody . And we pay for this peacekeeping ... but we get more than our money 's worth out of it . " *** It was July 1997 . President Clinton overlooked a vast , cobblestone square in Warsaw surrounded by tens of thousands of cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again will your fate be decided by others , " Clinton boomed to loud applause . " Thank you , Bill , " replied a banner stretched across Castle Square in gratitude for Clinton 's push to bring Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic into the western military alliance by 1999 . Complete with red , white , and blue balloons cascading onto the crowd , the moment was pure Clinton , a mixture of historic drama and campaign-like showmanship . But beyond the spectacular post-cold-war symbolism , the Warsaw drama confirmed that America was firmly committed to a robust and growing European alliance - a longtime strategic pillar that had fallen into question in the 1990s . When Clinton took office in 1993 , America had just emerged as the lone superpower . Yet many American and foreign experts were predicting a shrinking US presence in the world , following the break-up of the Soviet Union and end of the containment imperative . Doubts were cast upon the relevance of traditional US military alliances such as NATO , and the stationing of American troops in Europe . Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Lacking a strong enemy to focus on , the American public , as well as Congress , were losing an appetite for costly engagement in international affairs . Meanwhile , Clinton faced not the New World Order glowingly anticipated by the former Bush administration after the Persian Gulf War , but a world festering with localized chaos - messy internal conflicts fueled by old ethnic , tribal , and religious hatreds - in places few Americans knew or cared much about . All this , together with a US economy that was in a shaky recovery , raised expectations of an inward-looking Clinton presidency . President Clinton , however , made it clear early on , with a December 1991 speech at Georgetown University , that he believed strongly the US should remain engaged overseas and " lead the world that we have done so much to create . " But Clinton 's chief rationale for engagement - now a cliche - was then new : America 's need to ride the wave of globalization , or the economic and technological integration of the world . To thrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign markets to trade , and promote capitalism and ultimately democracy and human rights . Essentially , the young Arkansas governor who had labored to boost exports there , crafted for America an economics-driven strategy to replace the military-driven foreign policy of the previous 50 years . It was in pursuing economic goals abroad that Clinton took the greatest risks , and by all accounts was most successful in broadening US influence . In all , he signed some 300 trade agreements , from NAFTA to the World Trade Organization accord , helping promote a US economy where 25 percent of growth is tied to trade . Meanwhile , Washington engaged in the risky bailout of Mexico , and helped contain financial crises in Asia and Russia . It also backed China 's entry into the WTO , while pushing for wider market reforms in Russia and China . While Clinton 's drive to open markets has proven a boon for the US economy , it has had only mixed results in achieving his broader goal of expanding democracy . As a vital corollary to economic engagement , Clinton also moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US security and other alliances with Europe and Japan . " When we took office , we had no more urgent task than to adapt our alliances to a new era , " National Security Advisor Samuel Berger said in a Jan. 11 speech . By updating the strategic tie with Japan and revitalizing NATO " from a static cold war alliance to a magnet for new democracies , " Mr. Berger said earlier , Washington " saved our alliances from irrelevance . " For example , in April 1995 , Washington reaffirmed the US-Japan security treaty , easing Tokyo 's worries about the US military presence and ensuring continued American engagement in Asia . Experts give Clinton high marks for understanding the importance of preserving alliances when there was no clear enemy . " The enlargement of NATO is Clinton 's most enduring accomplishment and the most effective one , " says Zbigniew Brzezinski , a former national security advisor for President Carter . " It set in motion a process that is likely to continue . " Above all , Clinton 's initiatives on global market opening and trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the United States , isolationism is no longer an option . " Clinton realized that we had entered a new age , the global age , and you could not retreat , " says Mr. Daalder . " Globalization will remain a dominant theme in American foreign policy . US engagement with the world will endure . I think Clinton has proven beyond any doubt that one can not disengage from the world . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
