Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu wanted a " big bang " at the center of his astonishing first feature , Amores Perros  --  something that would slap it into rambunctious life , rather as the bigger astronomical bang did our universe eons ago . He found it in the car crash that opens his movie  --  a sudden , sickening blend of violently torn metal , wailing sirens , desperate screams and blood  --  lots of blood . <P> The intricately structured screenplay by novelist Guillermo Arriaga keeps reverting , ever more intimately and horrifically , to that crash , not merely showing it as the major figures in three intertwined stories experience it but also letting us see their lives prior to and after the disaster that radically reshapes their fates . Inarritu , 37 , who has made hundreds of TV commercials in Mexico City , consciously intends his movie to be a portrait of his " dangerous , beautiful " hometown . The film is muy espanol , a portrait that blends harsh realism with a curious tenderness . It is also muy Bunuel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy that is uniquely Inarritu 's . <P> He sums up his film this way : " It does n't make any difference if you are rich or poor , handsome or ugly ; we are all very vulnerable , very fragile . Look at Princess Di ... " That sense that even hair-trigger lives , always poised on the edge of self-destructive lunacy , deserve to be sympathetically understood is Amores Perros ' redeeming grace . It is what separates its sudden , apparently motiveless episodes of violence from the kind of standard-issue " frivolous entertainment violence " that Inarritu volubly deplores . It also helps explain the film 's enigmatic title , which translates roughly as " Love Is Like a Dog . " <P> The precipitator of the accident , Octavio ( Gael Garcia Bernal ) , is an angel-faced punk who 's successfully fighting Cofi , the family dog , in illegal arenas and using the winnings to tempt his brother 's pregnant wife into running off with him . Then there 's the supermodel Valeria ( Goya Toledo ) , whose smart car and lithe body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her latest lover . Finally , there 's the witness , El Chivo ( Emilio Echevarria ) , who has been a college professor and a guerrilla leader , and is now a street person with a cynical sideline as a killer for hire . <P> Their stories do n't relate narratively ; they just glance off one another . But they do relate emotionally , " conceptually . " As Inarritu says , " It 's very simple : you get to know people through their dogs . " Take Octavio . His relationship with Cofi is amiable but casual  --  until a rival handler shoots the dog , whereupon the frenzied Octavio stabs the would-be killer and rushes into his near fatal accident , as maddened by the threat to Cofi as he is by his lover 's hesitations and ambiguities . <P> Take Valeria . She 's as fluffy and self-absorbed as her tiny dog Richie . She can not endure the pain , loneliness and loss that follow the accident . He becomes similarly needy as a result of a mishap that is , at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her staring silently out the window at the blank wall that once held her picture , 10 stories tall , while he snoozes on her lap .
