Ever since the U.S. unveiled its radical new policy of bringing democracy to the Islamic world  --  whether through reform in Palestine or at the point of a gun in Iraq  --  the Bush Administration has come under attack for inconsistency and hypocrisy . Indeed , when our most critical ally in the war on terrorism , President Musharraf of Pakistan , gave himself dictatorial power for at least five years , that earned him but a few mild words of concern from the State Department . <P> The critics pounced . New Republic editor Peter Beinart assailed " the moral hypocrisy underlying America 's demand for democracy in Palestine and Iraq " while " we simultaneously coddle the dictators in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan . " Columnist Thomas Friedman complained that " the Bush team is advocating democracy only in authoritarian regimes that oppose America . " Washington Post editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt made the larger point : " The United States can not fight , let alone win , a cold-war-style campaign for freedom in the Islamic world unless , as in the cold war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy in China as well as in Iraq , to peace in Chechnya as well as in the Middle East . " <P> But wait . How did we win the cold war ? We fought and won the cold war , and thus liberated tens of millions of people , precisely because we prudently , albeit reluctantly , tolerated unfreedom in certain places . Why ? In order to win the larger battle for freedom on the global scale . Today we " coddle " Musharraf of Pakistan , Mubarak of Egypt , the Saudi princes . Yesterday we coddled Pinochet of Chile , Marcos of the Philippines , the Shah of Iran , Mobutu of Zaire and a train of South Vietnamese generals . <P> Why ? First , because , for all their faults , they were at the time better for their own people than those who would replace them . In those countries the alternative to autocracy was not democracy but often totalitarianism . We know all too well the history of the misery that followed the fall of our very flawed friends : genocide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran , catastrophic war in Zaire . <P> Second , because we often need such dictators to win the larger struggle against a global threat to liberty  --  Nazism , communism , Islamic radicalism . Did we not , after all , join with Stalin , one of the great monsters of the 20th century , in order to defeat Hitler ? Does anyone doubt not just the necessity but the morality of that alliance ? It is the principle of the lesser evil . As Churchill once famously said , " If I were told that the devil were on poorer terms with Hitler , I should find myself making an alliance with hell . " <P> Alliance with hell is justified as long as it is temporary . When Hitler was defeated , we stopped coddling Stalin . Forty years later , as communism ebbed , the U.S. helped overthrow Marcos and ease out Pinochet . We withdrew our support for those dictators once the two conditions that justify such alliances had disappeared : the global Soviet threat had receded and a domestic democratic alternative had emerged . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no democrat . Yet it is necessary to support him for now because he has enlisted Pakistan in our life-and-death struggle against radical Islam . And does anyone doubt that his overthrow would lead to more chaos and suffering within his country ?
