Hitting the Town <p> ( I ) <p> Had Eddie Wesley been a less reliable man , he would never have stumbled over the body , chased Junie to Tennessee , battled the devils to a draw , and helped to topple a President . But Eddie was blessed or perhaps cursed with a dependability that led to a lack of prudence in pursuing his devotion . He loved only two women in his life , loved them both with a recklessness that often made him a difficult man to like , and thus was able , when the moment arrived , to save the country he had come to hate . <p> A more prudent man might have failed . <p> As for Aurelia , she arrived with her own priorities , very conventional , very American , and so from the start very different from Eddie 's . Once they went their separate ways , there was no earthly reason to suppose the two of them would join forces , even after the events of that fateful Palm Sunday and what happened in Hong Kong-but join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on alone when everybody else had quit or died . <p> Almost everybody . <p> ( II ) <p> Edward Trotter Wesley Junior breezed into Harlem in May of 1954 , just days after the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools , a landmark decision that Eddie was certain must conceal some sort of dirty trick . He possessed a degree from Amherst , a couple of undistinguished years of graduate work at Brown , a handful of social connections through his mother , and a coveted job on the Amsterdam News , although he quit in disgust three months after starting . He had not realized , he explained in a letter to his beloved sister Junie , how very small and unimportant the position was . Junie , in a mischievous mood , forwarded his letter to their awesomely disapproving father , a Boston pastor and essayist . Actually , he was at this time in Montgomery , Alabama , helping to organize a boycott of local businesses that refused to call Negro patrons " Mr. " and " Mrs. " Wesley Senior , as he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monroe Trotter , the Negro journalist once arrested after tossing pepper to disrupt a speech by Booker T. Washington , and had inherited some of the fire of that clan . Upon his return to Boston , he answered Junie at once , sending along a surfeit of citations from the New Testament , most on the subject of hard work , commanding his daughter to share them with her brother . Eddie read them all ; Second Thessalonians 3:10 sufficiently stoked his fury that he did not write his parents for a month , for Eddie was rather fiery himself . When he at last pulled together enough money from odd jobs to afford a phone , he refused for weeks to give his parents the number . Wesley Senior thought Eddie lazy . But Eddie , to his own way of thinking , was simply focused . He did not want to write about car wrecks and speeches by the great leaders of the rising movement for Negro rights . He wanted to write short stories and novels and decided , in the manner of many an author before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , for a time , he mooched . <p> His mother sent money , cars were washed , meals were served , papers were sold . Around the corner from his apartment on 123rd Street was a Jewish grocery-that was what they were called , Jewish groceries , a reference to ownership , not cuisine-and Eddie for a time earned a second income working nights behind the cash register , reading and writing there on the counter because custom was thin . But a better offer came his way . In those days the seedier side of Harlem was largely run by a worthy named Scarlett , who had risen to power after the legendary Bumpy Johnson , king of the Negro rackets , was sentenced to prison for the third time . Scarlett owned a nightclub on 128th Street and much else besides , and was said to pay his dues to Frank Costello , the successor to Lucky Luciano and , at the time , the most powerful Mafia leader in New York . Scarlett was an elegant Jamaican who had come out of the old Forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . He liked to walk into shops and pull a huge bankroll from the pocket of his tailored suit , make a small purchase with a large bill , then tell the delighted proprietor to keep the change , thus cementing his reputation for generosity-never mind that a week later his people would be around to collect protection money from the very same store . At twenty-seven , a joyless term of military service behind him , Eddie Wesley was not known to be a scrapper . Still , he had a friend who had a friend , and before he knew it he was doing occasional odd jobs for bluff , secretive , boisterous men who were , or were not , connected to Scarlett . It was a living , Eddie told himself , but not his parents ; it was only until he was discovered as a writer ; besides , it would provide meat for the tales he would one day spin . He reminded himself , whenever moral doubts assailed him , that Richard Wright , in Black Boy , had confessed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the occasional fistful of tickets from the proprietor of a movie house , and Eddie was carrying mysterious packages across state lines , but he consoled himself with Wright 's dictum that the white man had done so many horrible things that stealing from him was no breach of ethics . And if part of him suspected that , whoever Scarlett was stealing from , it was n't the white man , Eddie suppressed the thought . <p> " Where do you go all these nights ? " asked Aurelia , his unattainably highborn girlfriend , whom he often wooed by reciting Andreas Cappelanus on the art of courtly love : medieval literature having been among his best courses at Amherst . They were canoodling , as it was called , in a shadowed booth at Scarlett 's club , not the sort of place where Eddie 's friends ever went , or , more important , Aurie 's . " You 're so secretive " - as though she herself was not . <p> " If I told you , you 'd never believe it . " <p> Aurelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Then it ca n't possibly be another woman . " <p> " You 're one to talk , " he said . <p> " I know . " Sipping her pink gin fizz with Kirschwasser , the drink for which she was known throughout Harlem . She was a columnist for the Seventh Avenue Sentinel , the second-largest Negro paper in town , and wrote about everyone 's scandalous peccadilloes but her own . " I am one to talk , " she said , and leaped to her feet , tugging at his arm . " Dance with me . Come on . " <p> " We shall be conspicuous , " said Eddie , in the peculiar elocution he had developed at Amherst . His friends mocked him , but women adored it . <p> " We shall not , " she teased , echoing his cadences , and perhaps she was even right , because Scarlett 's was also the sort of place that always remembered to forget you were ever there . But before they could have their dance , one of the boisterous men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited , told Aurelia they would have to make it an early night , conveying through his body English what he dared not speak aloud . Alas , Aurie was not so easily impressed : included in her family tree , as she would remind you at the drop of a hat , were villains galore , as well as a Reconstruction Era congressman and the first Negro to make a million dollars in real estate . <p> " You ca n't be involved with these people , " Aurelia said as they walked through the sooty Harlem rain . She wore cheap plastic overshoes , but her umbrella was from Paris , where her aunt sang jazz . <p> " It is n't involvement in the usual sense . " <p> She knew his excuses , too : " Let me guess . Research for the great novel . " <p> " Something like that . " <p> They had reached the public library on 135th Street , three blocks from the apartment Aurie shared with two other women . Cars were jammed so tightly along the curb that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as far as Eddie was ever allowed to go . Aurelia kissed him . She had feathery eyebrows and a roundish chipmunk face . When she was happy , she looked like a playful imp . When she was earnest , the roundness hardened , and she became Hollywood 's image of a schoolmarm . This was schoolmarm time . <p> " My family has certain expectations of me , " she began . " I 'm an only child . My future matters to them . A lot . " <p> " So you keep telling me . " <p> " Because it 's true . " The brow crinkled . " You know , Eddie , my uncle 's hotel business is- " <p> " I 'm a writer . " <p> " They own hotels in seven different- " <p> " I can not do it . " <p> " He makes good money . He 'll always make good money . I do n't care what the Supreme Court says . We 'll need colored hotels for the next fifty years . Maybe more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted to ask you one last time , because- " <p> He covered her mouth . Gently . They had been arguing the point almost from the night they met , at a college mixer two months after V-J Day . Both knew the outcome in advance . " I have to write , Aurie . The muse sits upon me . It is not a matter of choice . It is a matter of necessity . " <p> " Then you should have kept the newspaper job . " <p> " It was not real writing . " <p> " It was real money . " <p> Later that night , as Eddie left the train station in Newark , a couple of thugs tripped him , kicked him , snatched the parcel in its neat brown paper , ran . They had marked him down weeks ago and bided their time until he got careless . He was told by one of Scarlett 's people that the boys had admitted the crime . Not to the police . To Scarlett , who was said to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlett 's nickname was the Carpenter , a reference , it was rumored , to the unfortunate fate that had befallen his predecessor , whose right-hand man Scarlett had been , back when the poor gentleman possessed a right hand : something to do with nails and saws . A neighbor named Lenny , the dark , skinny imp who had tempted Eddie in the first place over to Scarlett 's side of the street , assured him that he was in only small trouble , not big , for losing the package : nothing would happen if he got out now . And so , when Scarlett 's people offered him a second chance , Eddie respectfully declined . For a month thereafter Eddie did not read the papers . He did not want to know what happened to the boys . <p> ( III ) <p> After that Eddie went back to washing cars and sweeping floors . He earned little money , and saved none , for what he did not spend on Aurelia he shared with friends and neighbors . He developed a reputation as a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would turn over his last dollar . This was not generosity in the usual sense , but neither was it calculated . He simply lived so thoroughly in the moment that it would never occur to him to hold on to a quarter because he might need it tomorrow . The most intensely political of his buddies , Gary Fatek , playing on Lenin , liked to say that when the revolution arrived Eddie would give the hangman cash to buy the rope ; but Gary was white , and rich , and hung out in Harlem to prove his bona fides . Aurie found Eddie 's lightness with money endearing , even though it called into question-she said-his ability to support a family . <p> " In the fullness of time , I shall be successful . " <p> " In the fullness of time , I shall be married . So watch out . " <p> As it happened , Aurie made this comment , to embarrassed laughter all around , at a small dinner party hosted by a young couple named Claire and Oliver Garland at their apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition to published writer . One of his stories had at last been accepted by a serious literary magazine . Ralph Ellison sent a note . Langston Hughes proposed a toast to Eddie 's grand future . Eddie had never met the famous writer , and was nervous . But Hughes , the greatest literary light in Harlem , put the young man at his ease . Hughes was broad and smiling , a spellbinder of the old school . Over brandy and cigars , he shared tales of a recent sojourn abroad . Eddie was enthralled . Langston Hughes lived the life Eddie coveted for himself . Running hotels with Aurelia 's uncle could not possibly compare . Oliver Garland , the only Negro lawyer on Wall Street , seemed to have been everywhere , too : he and his cousin Kevin and Langston Hughes compared notes on restaurants in Florence . Eddie , child of a preacher and a nurse , knew little of Negroes like this . <p> Gary Fatek was also at the party , along with a couple of other Caucasians , because members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring the cautious racialism of their parents . Afterward Gary pulled one of his cute political tricks , summoning a cab , climbing in with Eddie and Aurelia , then directing the driver to drop his friends in Harlem first and only then head to Gary 's own place in the Village . Everybody knew that a New York cabbie would otherwise never go north of Columbia University . Eddie , always a proud man , would never have cooperated with this nonsense had Aurelia not been present ; and Gary probably would not have tried . White friends were important , Wesley Senior had long preached to his children : That is where the power lies , he warned them , and where , for the foreseeable future , it will . Eddie and Aurelia sat together on the bench . Gary folded down the jump seat , and clutched the handle as the driver bumped angrily uptown . He lectured them about revolutionary politics . He was red-haired and gentle and certain . He said Eddie 's story showed the glimmering of consciousness , but only the glimmering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Even back in college , where the three of them first met , everybody had known that Eddie was entirely unpolitical . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
