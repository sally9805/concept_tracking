Buddy up in the kitchen , and salmon and orzo are yours in an hour // Caprial and John Pence share the struggle of most working couples : finding time to be together . The irony in their case is that they work together , running Caprial 's Bistro and a cooking school called Caprial and John 's Kitchen , bodn in Portland . But management duties and meetings keep their days all about business ; they have to carve out personal time . Having met in the kitchen-as students at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park , New York-they reconnect best there at home , cooking together . In a two-chef team , though , it 's important to honestly share duties , so neither is entirely responsible for the pice de rsistance of any meal and neither gets stuck chopping all the onions . They divvy up dishes in an egalitarian way to get dinner on the table quickly and to have a lot of fun in the process . The crucial elements : Each chef has to have his or her own space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of their dishes , to get the timing right . The Pences share their strategies for cooking together , plus prep plans for many menus , in their book Caprial and John 's Kitchen ( Ten Speed Press , 2003 ; $35 ) and in their new television series of the same name . This Northwest spring menu , adapted from their book , is easy enough for one person to pull together . But with two cooks , dinner 's on the table in just an hour . Radicchio wraps around goat cheese , pancetta around the radicchio , and the rolls get a turn on the grill . A fillet of wild salmon with herbs and wine roasts in the oven , along with a pan of fresh asparagus . A creamy green-olive sauce finishes the salmon with a rich touch . For dessert , splash local strawberries with citrus-flavored liqueur and top with crme frache . INFO : Caprial 's Bistro ( $$$ ; dosed Sun-Mon ; 7015 S.E.
