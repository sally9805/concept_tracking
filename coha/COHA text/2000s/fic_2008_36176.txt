1 <br> The Oklahoma City National Memorial Oklahoma City , Oklahoma <br> Ben Kincaid stood at the corner of Lincoln Boulevard , still unable to believe he was really about to meet the President of the United States . In his short time as a replacement senator he had viewed President Blake from a distance , even attended ceremonies at the White House  --  but an actual face-to-face meeting was something else again . Was it only yesterday he was a small-time attorney with a struggling , profitless practice and a shoddy office in downtown Tulsa ? It seemed that way . The whirlwind of events that had put him in the Washington limelight still seemed unreal . And the most unreal part was that his meteoric rise to the U.S. Senate was not the most amazing , unbelievable , life-shattering thing that had happened to him recently . <br> He stared at the gold band on the ring finger of his left hand , incredulous . <br> Ben Kincaid was a married man . <br> Major Mike Morelli , standing just beside him , leaned toward Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? " <br> " No . I was convinced I 'd be a bachelor my entire life . " <br> Mike did a double take . " Ben  --  I was talking about shaking hands with the leader of the free world . " <br> " Oh . " <br> " This is a major event . " <br> " Getting married is a major event . " <br> " Ah , the lover . ' Sighing like a furnace , with a woeful ballad / Made to his mistress 's eyebrow . ' " <br> " If you 're going to start with the poetry , I 'm disinviting you , " Ben said . " It 's just a big life change , that 's all . After you 've been single so long . " <br> " Poor boy . ' So we 'll go no more a-roving / So late into the night . . . ' " <br> " I think I 'm hearing poetry again . " <br> " You need to relax , Ben . People get married all the time . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's only one president . " <br> Ben shrugged . " I did n't vote for him . " <br> " You did n't vote at all ! " <br> " I voted for Christina . Till death us do part . " <br> Mike rolled his eyes . " You are too sappy for words . " <br> " I recall a time  --  " Ben stopped short . He remembered when Mike was in the flush of new love  --  with Ben 's younger sister , Julia . He and Ben had been college roommates , Mike an English major , Ben studying music , when Mike met Julia . After a whirlwind courtship , they were married , but the union did n't last long . Julia fled to somewhere on the East Coast and neither of them had seen her in years . Happily , despite this trauma and the deep scars it left , he and Mike had remained best friends throughout the intervening years , as Ben established his law practice and Mike rose to become a senior homicide investigator with the Tulsa Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad smile flickering on his face . They 'd known each other long enough that Ben did n't have to finish the sentence . <br> As if he sensed the need for a mood change , Mike 's expression suddenly shifted to a broad and rather naughty grin . " Speaking of your new bride  --  is she still pissed ? " <br> Ben 's neck stiffened . " I would n't put it quite like that . " <br> " I 'll bet . ' Hell hath no fury . . . ' " <br> " She 's just . . . " Ben drew in his breath , then slowly released it . " . . . Grumpy . " <br> " Imagine . And all you did was cancel her honeymoon . " <br> " There were extenuating circumstances . President Blake personally requested that I be here when he visited my home state . " <br> " But that did n't satisfy Christina ? " <br> " You know how . . . forceful she can be . Plus , she 's wanted to see France all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man is a Republican . " <br> Mike smirked . " Which I guess explains why she 's not standing beside you playing the loyal wife . " <br> Ben shuffled his feet . " Well , someone had to stay in the gallery with my mother . " <br> " Senator Kincaid ? " <br> Ben felt a light tap on his shoulder . The man standing behind him was young , perhaps early thirties , sandy-haired . He was wearing a midnight-blue suit , thin tie , and sunglasses , which Ben knew meant he must be one of the dozens of Secret Service agents stationed around the Oklahoma City National Memorial . " Yes ? " <br> " I 'm Agent Max Zimmer . I 'm here to escort you to the reception position , where the cameras and crowd can see the president emerge from Cadillac One "  --  he smiled  --  " from a safe distance . " <br> But of course . It was n't as if the president had asked him here because of his deep personal affection . After that business over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a miracle the man would speak to Ben at all . What he wanted was to be seen at an important Oklahoma event with a newly minted senator with unaccountably high approval ratings . <br> Ben heard what sounded like the buzz of a bumblebee coming from Zimmer 's coat sleeve . The agent casually raised the sleeve to his mouth , listened for a moment , then spoke into it . " Understood . Samson in five . " He looked up . " Come along , Senator . Time for you and your guest to move . " <br> Ben and Mike followed the agent to the street just behind the Oklahoma City National Memorial , erected on the site of the former Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , the office complex that was blown to bits by Timothy McVeigh 's fertilizer bomb on this very date , several years before . It was a catastrophic event no Oklahoman would ever forget . Memorial services were held here on this date annually , and this year , the sitting president was in attendance to offer his condolences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact that Oklahoma was a borderline red/blue state whose electoral votes were currently uncertain had nothing to do with it . <br> It was a magnificent memorial , the largest of its kind in the United States , designed to honor the fallen , the survivors , the rescuers , and everyone else whose life had been indelibly changed by the tragedy . Enormous twin bronze gates framed the 3.3-acre expanse within . Because the explosion occurred at 9:02 a.m. , the eastern gate was engraved with the time 9:01  --  the last minute of peace  --  and the western gate was engraved with 9:03  --  the first moment of the ensuing horror . A reflecting pool stretched across the center of the memorial between the two gates , a thin layer of water over polished black marble . On one side of the pool was the Field of Empty Chairs : 168 chairs of bronze , glass , and stone , one for each of the people who died in the explosion . <br> As they walked , Ben saw a face he recognized . <br> " Brad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . " Good to see you . " <br> The tall , lanky man in the blue suit took Ben 's hand cordially . " Kincaid , you are the worst liar I have ever met . " <br> Ben 's face colored . <br> " Seriously . Worst liar in the history of humanity . Which explains why you 'll never make it in politics . " <br> " Or , " Mike grumbled , " explains why his approval rating is so much higher than yours . " <br> Tidwell responded with a thin smile that , were Ben in a less charitable mood , he might have called a sneer . " Senator Kincaid has never had the pleasure of conducting an actual campaign . Believe me , if he ever does , his numbers will drop . " <br> Tidwell was a two-term senator based in Oklahoma City . After Senator Todd Glancy resigned , he had become the state 's senior senator , with Ben as his very junior partner . Since they represented different parties , they had spent much of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since you 're a newbie , I wanted to make sure we were clear on protocol : when the president approaches us , I shake his hand first . " <br> Ben caught Mike rolling his eyes . <br> " Maybe I 'm crazy , " Ben said , " but should n't we let the president decide who he wants to greet first ? " <br> " And he will . He knows how the game is played . You 're the one I 'm worried about . No grandstand plays for the cameras and the folks back home . Do n't lunge for the man 's hand . " <br> " If he were stupid enough to lunge for the president 's hand , " Mike noted , " he would probably be tackled by a dozen Secret Service agents . " <br> " Another good point . See , Kincaid  --  I 'm just looking out for your best interests . Brother senators should be friends . " <br> Riiiight , Ben thought . And with a friend like you . . . <br> They stopped walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Senator Kincaid , this is Agent Gatwick , my immediate superior . Everything in place , Tom ? " <br> " Right on schedule . " <br> " Snipers ? " <br> " In place . " <br> " Agents ? " <br> " As planned . Domino Bravo . " <br> " Excellent . " Zimmer turned toward the north end of the street . " Here he comes . " <br> Ben followed his gaze and saw a large black sedan followed by what appeared to be an endless stream of black sedans flanked by motorcycle cops . " How many cars are in the presidential motorcade ? " <br> " Twenty-two . " <br> Ben 's eyes bulged . " Are you joking ? Who 's in all of those cars ? " <br> " Secret Service in several . Homeland Security in a few . Local police . Press vans . One car carrying the president 's doctor and several refrigerated pints of the president 's blood . Various important dignitaries , not important enough for a personal meet-and-greet like you , but important enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A counterassault team , to deal with potential attacks . The ' bomb sweep '  --  that 's the first police car . It has the unpleasant and dangerous job of clearing the way for the motorcade . Another eight or so vehicles  --  the ' secure package '  --  will split off from the motorcade and take the president somewhere safe in the event of an emergency . " <br> Ben continued to stare . " Is that the president 's car ? " <br> " Nah . The Beast will be packed somewhere in the middle . " <br> " The Beast ? " <br> Agent Gatwick nodded . " That 's what we call the president 's car . Cadillac One . " <br> " Why ' The Beast ' ? " <br> " Because it 's a monster . A real leviathan . A Caddy DTS stretch sedan with satellite GPS and communication equipment . He could call an astronaut on the moon from that car . Carries its own air supply in case someone gasses the outside air . Totally bulletproof  --  the body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from inch-thick polycarbonate glass . In the event of a puncture , the tires can heal themselves . " <br> " It 's the Batmobile . " <br> " Basically , yeah . Without the tail fins . " <br> " What 's a car like that cost ? " <br> " Last I heard , about twelve million . " <br> Ben whistled . <br> " And for all that  --  it gets lousy gas mileage . " Behind the sunglasses , Ben sensed a twinkle in Zimmer 's eye . " But it has a hell of a sound system . " <br> Far above the motorcade , in a grandstand recon office temporarily constructed on the roof of the adjoining Oklahoma City Memorial Museum , three sets of eyes were trained on the activities below . <br> " So she made it in time , " the oldest of the three , an extremely tall black man , commented . <br> " Just barely , " said the other man in the group . " But from what I hear , they had a little snuggle on Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the only female of the three . " She can do anything she wants to . " <br> " I do n't doubt it , " the younger of the two men replied . " The question was whether she wanted to . " <br> " Do n't be absurd . If this is a marriage of political convenience , then it would be pretty stupid to miss a television spot that more than forty million people are expected to view live . " <br> " You seem to have some real insight here . Maybe you should go into politics . " <br> " Tempting . But I would hate campaigning . Ca n't keep my mouth shut long enough . And I have a few skeletons in my closet . " <br> " Who does n't ? " <br> " Nerds are the only people who can run for political office in this country these days . To get elected , you have to be one of three possible things : old , homely  --  or male . " She smiled . " I 'm none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unmarried sex life . I 'm unelectable . " <br> " But if the reports and rumors I 'm getting about the first lady are true  --  " <br> " She 's here , is n't she ? " <br> " But the scuttlebutt  --  " <br> " And she 's always there when he needs her , right ? " <br> " But  --  " <br> " Do n't be so easily misled , " the woman said , pointing a finger so close , it almost touched his nose . " All the sex in the world ca n't compete with the thrill of receiving the applause of millions of potential voters . Remember what Kissinger said . " <br> " And that would be ? " <br> Her upper lip curled in a distinctively naughty manner . " Power is the greatest aphrodisiac . " <br> Joel Salter felt a shiver creep up his spine . Bad enough he had to be the only Feeb in the outpost without that woman here making him supremely uncomfortable . He could still recall a time when this would 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominally under the direction of the secretary of treasury , would 've been managed by the deputy director of the FBI . Ever since the Secret Service had been transferred to Homeland Security , though , he hated these assignments . He was worse than a third wheel ; he would n't be useful even in the event of a flat tire . Unless he had some intel to provide , they did n't want any part of the FBI . The general attitude seemed to be that if the FBI had been doing its job , Homeland Security would never have come into existence . People like Carl Lehman and Nichole Muldoon did n't want him tainting their operation . <br> Muldoon was watching through high-powered binoculars that allowed her to peer through the green-tinted windows of Cadillac One . " My God , " she said , " they 're not even sitting on the same side . I guess absence does not make the heart grow fonder . " <br> Salter cleared his throat . " My understanding is that she sits facing him so that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the president . An unshared spotlight . A generous gesture , really . " <br> Muldoon snorted . " More likely she wants a minute to pull up her pantyhose . " She lowered the glasses and gave Salter another one of those looks . " You might know that , Joel . If you 'd ever seen a woman 's pantyhose . " <br> He smiled faintly , trying to be a good sport . Truth was , Nichole Muldoon was no worse than most of the women he 'd met in his law enforcement career , and was better than some . Certainly smarter than most . But something about her made him feel awkward . And ancient . At forty-six , he was only about a decade older than she . He 'd worked hard to get his position in the FBI , as opposed to her meteoric rise in Homeland Security . He had years of experience where she had brains . But all of this was beside the point . At the end of the day , he knew it was n't her brains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't even have to try . Did n't need makeup . She could stand there in a beige business suit with a little gold-buttoned jacket and it looked like a floor-length ruby red ball gown with a slit up the side and cleavage down to her navel . Nichole Muldoon had the look  --  the Look  --  that forced you to fantasize about what it would be like to have sex with her , even though you knew there was n't the slightest chance of it ever happening . <br> He could n't even have the pleasure of blaming her for the effect she had on him , suggesting she was using sex appeal to get ahead . As far as he knew , she was totally oblivious to the impact she was having on his libido . Sure , she made remarks about the first lady 's sex life and the size of the president 's equipment , but who did n't ? That was SOP in the sheltered world of Protect-the-President . That was just being one of the boys . If anything , that behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't . Not ever . Not for one second . All she had to do was toss that shoulder-length blond hair back and he was orbiting Jupiter . <br> " Did you hear what I said , Joel ? " <br> He jerked to attention . " I 'm sorry . I was . . . surveying the crowd . " <br> Carl Lehman frowned down at him . Great . Make the deputy director of Homeland Security think you 're an idiot . That 'll push you up the ranks . " I told you we still have n't located Marshall . " <br> " Really ? " He had to seem surprised , even though he was n't . " Did someone call his wife ? " <br> " Yeah . She 's clueless . " <br> " Did n't he disappear once before ? " <br> " Yeah . " Lehman ran his hand over the top of his head as if he had hair , although there had n't been any for many years . But since he was so much taller than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were n't on duty that day . Samson was n't out amongst the Philistines . " <br> " Any cause for concern ? " <br> Muldoon jabbed him in the side . " You know Carl . The rising of the sun in the morning is cause for concern . " <br> " But your people know what to do , right ? " Salter asked . " They do n't need Marshall breathing over their shoulders . " <br> " True enough , " Lehman agreed . " But it 's still strange . Damn strange . " He drew in his breath , then slowly released it . " I suppose I 'm just an old man worrying about nothing . Look , " he said , pointing toward the tableau below . " Samson is getting out of The Beast . " <br> ... <br> The first six cars in the motorcade passed by , but the seventh slowed precisely opposite where Ben and the others were standing . Two police motorcycles swirled around the car , sirens blaring . Ben felt a tingle course through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew who was sitting in the backseat of that car . It would be hard to miss . The presidential seals were emblazoned on the rear doors ; an American flag flew proudly from the bumper . <br> Zimmer talked into his sleeve again . " Roger . Samson has arrived . " He leaned closer to Ben . " See the presidential standard raised from the left front fender ? That tells us that the commander in chief is inside the vehicle . " <br> Zimmer stepped forward and pressed the security release button under the handle that allowed the door to be opened from the outside . Ben felt a sharp intake of breath . At first , all he could see was the interior of the car  --  blue leather upholstery with wood veneer accents . He spotted a fold-out desk being returned to its upright position . A long leg in a blue suit emerged . Behind the dark , green-tinted window , Ben saw the outline of a familiar female face . <br> Beside him , Ben sensed Senator Tidwell inch ever so subtly forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Gatwick positioned himself behind . A dotted circle of agents surrounded the car , some of them scanning the horizon , some of them scanning the sky . <br> Behind the rope line , a huge swell of shouting and applause erupted . The president waved , smiled , then turned his attention to the phalanx of people waiting to greet him . <br> The president spotted Senator Tidwell and nodded , spotted Ben and nodded . . . <br> Then he walked directly up to Mike and shook his hand . <br> " A pleasure to meet you , Major Morelli . A real pleasure . " <br> Mike was obviously stunned . His usual savoir faire had utterly abandoned him . " A . . . p-pleasure to  --  to meet you , too , Mr. President . " <br> " I was very pleased when I heard Senator Kincaid had invited you . Always glad to meet a true public servant , someone who puts himself on the line for the common good . If there could be any benefit emerging from 9/11 , it 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work you and your brethren do really is . " <br> Mike was still shaking his hand . " I  --  I do n't know what to say . " <br> " You do n't have to say anything , " the president replied , gently using his left hand to extract his right . His mostly gray hair shone in the morning sun . " Your work says it all for you . I 'm a fan . " <br> Mike 's lips parted , a blank expression on his face . " You 're  --  a fan  --  of mine ? " <br> " Absolutely . That work you did on the Kindergarten Killer case  --  outstanding . Showed up the Feds on that one , did n't you ? " he added , winking collegially . " No telling how many lives you saved . Made the world a better place , that 's for sure . " <br> " But  --  " Mike stammered . He still could n't think clearly . " How do you know about that case ? " <br> President Blake took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's book . " He extended his hand again . " How are you , Senator Kincaid ? " <br> Ben felt startled and confused . " You read my book ? " <br> " Both of them , actually . Excellent pieces of work , though I preferred the first . " He winked again . " Have to . I 'm a law and order candidate . " <br> Ben struggled to work his head through this revelation , without success . <br> " Meant to tell you , " the president continued . " Appreciated the hard work you did to get Justice Roush on the Supreme Court . " <br> It was Ben 's turn to arch an eyebrow . The president may have nominated Justice Roush , but he and his party abandoned him when it was revealed that Roush was gay . " You did ? " <br> " First rule of politics , Senator  --  do n't jump to any conclusions . I did what my party required . We ca n't afford to lose the support of the religious right . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he remains one today . " <br> " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " <br> As if he were passing through butter , President Blake eased on down the line . " Senator Tidwell . Good to see you . " <br> Ben did n't have to be a mind reader to know that Tidwell was fuming . Ben could almost sympathize . Tidwell was the only member of the president 's party in the reception line and he was the last to be received . <br> " And you , Mr. President . " <br> As if to give the last man a special bonus , the president leaned forward slightly and placed his hand on Tidwell 's shoulder . " I 've seen that energy bill you co-sponsored . I like it . " <br> " Thank you , " Tidwell said . Ben noticed that even this two-term senator was stammering a bit . " Does that mean we can count on you to sign the bill after it 's passed ? " <br> The president smiled the sort of wide , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest office in the land . " I said I liked it , Brad . Signing is a whole different thing . You ca n't marry every woman you like . " He pivoted . " Which reminds me of a woman I like very much . " <br> As he turned , the first lady , Emily Blake , stepped from the limo . If anything , the chorus of hooting and hollering that followed exceeded the reception that had been given the president . Emily Blake was younger than her husband , but not by so much as to attract discussion . She was medium-sized , dark-haired , and dressed in a tasteful but sensible manner that reflected her tasteful but sensible demeanor . Ben knew she was extremely popular , especially in the Southwest . <br> The president took her hand , helped her off the curb , then raised both their hands into the air . The crowd went wild . <br> " Listen to that , " Tidwell murmured in Ben 's ear . " Her approval ratings are considerably higher than his and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got . " <br> " Is n't that a bit cynical ? " Ben said , as he watched the First Couple bathe in the limelight . " It 's hardly unusual for a man to bring his wife to a major event . " <br> Tidwell made a snorting noise . " He did n't bring her . She flew in from Tucson . They met at the OKC airport down the road . " <br> Ben nodded . Oklahoma City 's Will Rogers World Airport was one of only three very special airports named for men who died in a plane crash . " She probably had a fund-raising event . It 's that time again . " <br> Tidwell shook his head . " It 's a marriage in name only , contrived purely for political purposes . They do n't do anything together . They do n't share anything . Not even the First Bedroom . " <br> Ben reared his head back , appalled . " How could you possibly know that ? " <br> Tidwell shrugged in a nonchalant manner that Ben found extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the higher circles . " <br> Which , Ben knew Tidwell was implying , he did n't . But of course  --  Tidwell was right . Ben did n't know what to make of Tidwell 's gratuitous scuttlebutting of his party 's leader . Was he ticked off because the president greeted him last ? Or was there something more going on ? <br> The Secret Service agent closest to the president lightly touched his sleeve , which Ben knew was the signal for him to move on . Even with all this security , they never liked the president to stay in one place for too long until he had arrived at his destination . <br> As the First Couple turned toward the dais , the first lady stopped . " Senator Kincaid ! " <br> Ben stood at attention . " Yes , ma'am ? " <br> She smiled , exuding warmth . " Where 's that pretty little wife of yours ? " <br> Ben fumbled for words . " She 's . . . in the audience . With my mother . " <br> Emily Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " <br> " Well . . . " <br> " Tell that lovely redhead I 'm inviting her to the White House for tea . We need to have a heart-to-heart . " <br> The president took his wife gently by the arm . " Now , Emily . We do n't harass a man about his wife . Even if he is a Democrat . " <br> " But , Frank  --  they 're newlyweds . " <br> " That 's right . It slipped my mind . " He gave Ben another wink . " So what the hell are you doing here , son ? " <br> Secret Service agents Zimmer and Gatwick flanked the president and slowly escorted him toward the dais from which he would speak . All around them , Ben saw agents scurrying into position , watching all possible angles , talking into their sleeves . Ben knew there were at least as many , possibly more , agents working undercover , filtering quietly through the crowd looking for signs of trouble , as well as numerous sniper nests covering not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his group took the stage several steps behind the First Couple and were escorted to their seats . Risers had been erected opposite the reflecting pool to create a presidential platform with seats for important dignitaries behind and to each side . A podium bearing the presidential seal stood in the center . Just beyond the podium , a dense crowd of reporters hovered with mikes and minicams . <br> Ben marveled at all the activity , all the work that went on behind the scenes of a relatively simple presidential appearance . But he was cheered by the realization that , after so much work , caution , and preparation , nothing could possibly go wrong . <br> Continues ...
