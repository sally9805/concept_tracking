" Four-ball , side pocket . " Aislinn pushed the cue forward with a short , quick thrust ; the ball dropped into the pocket with a satisfying clack . Her playing partner , Denny , motioned toward a harder shot , a bank shot . She rolled her eyes . " What ? You in a hurry ? " He pointed with the cue . " Right . " Focus and control , that 's what it 's all about . She sank the two . He nodded once , as close as he got to praise . Aislinn circled the table , paused , and chalked the cue . Around her the cracks of balls colliding , low laughter , even the endless stream of country and blues from the jukebox kept her grounded in the real world : the human world , the safe world . It was n't the only world , no matter how much Aislinn wanted it to be . But it hid the other world-the ugly one-for brief moments . " Three , corner pocket . " She sighted down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control . Then she felt it : warm air on her skin . A faery , its too-hot breath on her neck , sniffed her hair . His pointed chin pressed against her skin . All the focus in the world did n't make Pointy-Face 's attention tolerable . She scratched : the only ball that dropped was the cue ball . Denny took the ball in hand . " What was that ? " " Weak-assed ? " She forced a smile , looking at Denny , at the table , anywhere but at the horde coming in the door . Even when she looked away , she heard them : laughing and squealing , gnashing teeth and beating wings , a cacophony she could n't escape . They were out in droves now , freer somehow as evening fell , invading her space , ending any chance of the peace she 'd sought . Denny did n't stare at her , did n't ask hard questions . He just motioned for her to step away from the table and called out , " Gracie , play something for Ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few not-country-or-blues songs : Limp Bizkit 's " Break Stuff . " As the oddly comforting lyrics in that gravelly voice took off , building to the inevitable stomach-tightening rage , Aislinn smiled . If I could let go like that , let the years of aggression spill out onto the fey . . . She slid her hand over the smooth wood of the cue , watching Pointy-Face gyrate beside Grace . I 'd start with him . Right here , right now . She bit her lip . Of course , everyone would think she was utterly mad if she started swinging her cue at invisible bodies , everyone but the fey . Before the song was over , Denny had cleared the table . " Nice . " Aislinn walked over to the wall rack and slid the cue back into an empty spot . Behind her , Pointy-Face giggled-high and shrill-and tore out a couple strands of her hair . " Rack ' em again ? " But Denny 's tone said what he did n't : that he knew the answer before he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs . Pointy-Face slid the strands of her hair over his face . Aislinn cleared her throat . " Rain check ? " " Sure . " Denny began disassembling his cue . The regulars never commented on her odd mood swings or unexplainable habits . She walked away from the table , murmuring good-byes as she went , consciously not staring at the faeries . They moved balls out of line , bumped into people-anything to cause trouble-but they had n't stepped in her path tonight , not yet . At the table nearest the door , she paused . " I 'm out of here . " One of the guys straightened up from a pretty combination shot . He rubbed his goatee , stroking the gray-shot hair . " Cinderella time ? " " You know how it is-got to get home before the shoe falls off . " She lifted her foot , clad in a battered tennis shoe . " No sense tempting any princes . " He snorted and turned back to the table . A doe-eyed faery eased across the room ; bone-thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once . Her eyes were far too large for her face , giving her a startled look . Combined with an emaciated body , those eyes made her seem vulnerable , innocent . She was n't . None of them are . The woman at the table beside Aislinn flicked a long ash into an already overflowing ashtray . " See you next weekend . " Aislinn nodded , too tense to answer . In a blurringly quick move , Doe-Eyes flicked a thin blue tongue out at a cloven-hoofed faery . The faery stepped back , but a trail of blood already dripped down his hollowed cheeks . Doe-Eyes giggled . Aislinn bit her lip , hard , and lifted a hand in a last half wave to Denny . Focus . She fought to keep her steps even , calm : everything she was n't feeling inside . She stepped outside , lips firmly shut against dangerous words . She wanted to speak , to tell the fey to leave so she did n't have to , but she could n't . Ever . If she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see them . The only way to survive was to keep that secret ; Grams taught her that rule before she could even write her name : Keep your head down and your mouth closed . It felt wrong to have to hide , but if she even hinted at such a rebellious idea , Grams would have her in lockdown-homeschooled , no pool halls , no parties , no freedom , no Seth . She 'd spent enough time in that situation during middle school . Never again . So-rage in check-Aislinn headed downtown , toward the relative safety of iron bars and steel doors . Whether in its base form or altered into the purer form of steel , iron was poisonous to fey and thus gloriously comforting to her . Despite the faeries that walked her streets , Huntsdale was home . She 'd visited Pittsburgh , walked around D.C. , explored Atlanta . They were nice enough , but they were too thriving , too alive , too filled with parks and trees . Huntsdale was n't thriving . It had n't been for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
