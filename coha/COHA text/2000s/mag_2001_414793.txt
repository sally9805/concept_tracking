Got Buttermilk ? * True buttermilk is exactly that : liquid skimmed from cream being churned into butter . Today most dairies make buttermilk by adding live cultures to skim milk . * If stored in a tightly covered container at 40 deg F , buttermilk should keep for about 2 weeks . * Do n't freeze buttermilk-the liquid will separate . * Eight ounces of buttermilk ( made from skim milk ) provides about 90 calories and is a good source of protein , calcium , and vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) . <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
