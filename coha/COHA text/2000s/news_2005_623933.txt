<p> The University of California said Monday it had tapped an outside auditor to investigate pay packages for its top managers , a measure that faculty members demanded in response to revelations that the university was paying many employees far more than officials reported to the public . <p> " We are a public institution , and insofar there is less than total public confidence , we must gain total public confidence , " UC President Robert Dynes said Monday in a conference call with reporters . <p> UC said the audit will be conducted by the university 's regular accounting firm , PricewaterhouseCoopers , and will be completed by March . It will look at whether UC followed its own policies in approving compensation and separation agreements for 32 top management positions over the past decade . The auditor will report to the UC Board of Regents . <p> " We are committed to public access , awareness and understanding of all of the regents ' decision-making processes , " said Gerald Parsky , the Board of Regents chairman . " We also recognize some public concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive compensation . " <p> In a series of articles last month , The Chronicle reported that UC quietly gave employees $871 million last fiscal year in bonuses , moving allowances , administrative stipends and other types of cash compensation in addition to salaries and overtime . The Chronicle also reported that UC had added hundreds of high-paying jobs at the same time it said it was forced to boost student fees , cut services , increase class sizes , and freeze pay for thousands of lower-paid workers . <p> After the stories were published , the state Legislature , which oversees a significant portion of UC 's funding , scheduled hearings into the university 's compensation practices . Dozens of faculty members at UC Berkeley and UCLA signed a petition calling for an independent investigation . <p> " The announcement today is a big stride forward in opening up this process and shining a bright light into the bowels of this huge UC bureaucracy , " said UC Berkeley education and public policy Professor Bruce Fuller , who organized the faculty petition . " It remains to be seen precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The university has taken a number of steps over the past month to do damage control , including setting up a task force to look into its disclosure policies , contacting lawmakers and setting up a Web site to respond to the stories . <p> In addition , UC Provost M.R.C. Greenwood resigned and the university placed a vice president , Winston Doby , on administrative leave after The Chronicle asked about two recent hires with ties to Greenwood , her son and a business partner . UC said it plans to announce the results of an investigation into the matter soon . <p> In addition to the audit , UC announced plans Monday to create a special regents committee that will review senior managers ' salaries . UC officials say their top employees are underpaid , but have refused to release the report they cite to support that assertion . <p> The regents previously had a subcommittee that focused on compensation issues but did away with it in 1992 after complaints that it secretly approved a multimillion-dollar golden parachute for then-UC President David Gardner . The new panel will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible and include more regents . <p> University officials also named the nine members of the task force that Dynes created last month to review UC 's practices in disclosing compensation . <p> The panel will be chaired by Regent Joanne Kozberg . Members will include Robert Hertzberg , a former Democratic state Assembly speaker and ex-regent ; Jay Harris , a former San Jose Mercury News publisher ; former Democratic state Sen. Dede Alpert ; and James Morley Jr. , president of the National Association of College and University Business Officers . <p> Among the matters the task force will investigate is a settlement that the university agreed to with a top administrator at UC Davis without approval from the regents , apparently in violation of university policy . The settlement , which The Chronicle reported Monday , granted former Vice Chancellor Celeste Rose a $205,000 salary for two years as a senior adviser to the chancellor but with no regular duties . <p> Patrick Callan , president of the nonprofit National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education , said it was too early to say whether the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The university does get audited anyway , " Callan said . " So until you know exactly what information the regents will have that they did n't have before , it is hard to say how useful it will be . " <p> Callan said the regents committee could be helpful but only if the regents look beyond individual salaries and examine the overall number of high-paid employees . <p> " The question is , how many of these highly paid people do we need at the UC president 's office and the campuses ? " Callan said . <p> UC has refused to refuse to release a report it recently commissioned to compare its pay levels with those of other universities . Both The Chronicle and a labor union requested a copy of the report last month , after UC cited it to justify its salaries . <p> " It 's ironic that the university as a prestigious research institution wants to publish conclusions based on data and methodology that it refuses to disclose to the taxpayers who paid for it , " said Faith Raider , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , County and Municipal Employees , which represents thousands of UC workers . <p> Raider said the union might file suit against UC for violating the state Public Records Act if the university does not release the report by today . <p> Dynes said the consultant 's report contained " proprietary data . " <p> " We are working to cull that out , " Dynes said . " We do n't want to break the law " by releasing such information . <p> UC declined to say when it might release portions of the report , prepared by Mercer Human Resource Consulting . University spokesman Paul Schwartz said officials were negotiating with Mercer on the issue . <p> Public reaction to UC 's pay practices <p> The University of California released dozens of public comments Monday that have been submitted to a Web site that officials set up last month to respond to revelations about UC 's pay practices . <p> The majority of comments UC received Nov. 14 to 30 criticized officials for paying some employees much more than UC reports to the public . The Chronicle obtained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act . <p> UC withheld the names of people who made the comments . In addition , the university said it was unsure how many other comments it has received via other e-mail addresses and postal mail . <p> Among the comments the university released :  --  " As a Cal grad , I 'm disgusted to see the regents raising students ' costs of education while padding the pockets of the top executives of UC . ... This compensation issue is deterring many like myself from giving to Cal/UC. "  --  " There is really no way to put a positive spin on the obscene greed implied by a three-quarter million ( dollar ) annual salary for one employee , while many essential and respectably educated research employees make $28,000 to $30,000 annually . "  --  " Hiring physicians is challenging in a competitive market . ... When our trainees graduate , we can not afford to hire them at market rates . They are offered between 50 percent and 150 percent more than we pay our faculty . "  --  " Shame on you pigs at the trough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greed tactics .  --  a UC manager " <p> For the full list of comments , go to sfgate.com.  --  Tanya Schevitz and Todd Wallack
