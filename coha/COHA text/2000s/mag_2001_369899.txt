Ok , this may not be the best moment for cyberspace . Napster is stumbling . NASDAQ is a bust . Whole sectors of the virtual economy are wrapping up their stories at Chapter 11 . But who cares if investors lose faith in the digital world ? The artists are sticking with it  --  at least the ones who lately have been making some galleries look like Circuit City , full of dot-matrix screens and wall-mounted monitors . Remember when videotape was the hot new medium ? Compared with CD-ROM art and screen-saver art , with website artworks or virtual-reality goggles , videotape is starting to look quaint , even primordial . Like charcoal . <P> You know these developments must be reaching critical mass when two museums decide simultaneously to look into them . " BitStreams " at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York City and " 010101 : Art in Technological Times " at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art are Zeitgeist shows , attempts to collect a few specimens of this emerging practice and let them vibrate in proximity to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw broad conclusions , no gathering of everybody into schools or " isms . " The spirit behind both is to let a thousand digits bloom . <P> In some ways , this is a moment like the first decades of the 20th century , when biplanes , automobiles and skyscrapers looked like portents of a magnificent new world in the making . The essential task for many artists then was to align themselves with the dynamic forces of that world , to heap up raptures to horsepower and the Brooklyn Bridge . Cyberspace and digital technology have some of the same glamour and promise , but the romance of technology has long since wilted . After two world wars and Three Mile Island , who can take seriously the militant modernity of the Italian Futurists or the Russian Constructivists ? What artists want now is to use new technologies without falling for them . <P> So when Inez van Lamsweerde ( at the Whitney ) digitally erases her boyfriend Vinoodh from Me Kissing Vinoodh ( Passionately ) , she is not worshipping digital photo retouching . She 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion without its object . And when Jochem Hendricks ( at SFMOMA ) uses a specially constructed helmet to read the smallest movements of his eyes and translate those into a scribbled line drawing like Reading , he is not paying homage to the electrocardiogram . He 's using a similar technology to achieve a strangely more intimate end .
