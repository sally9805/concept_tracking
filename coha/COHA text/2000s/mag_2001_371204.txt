Everyone needs a well of hope . Did you hear that there was a 70-year-old man on a top floor of one of the towers who managed to surf the crumbling building all the way down to the street , surviving with nothing more than two broken legs ? We would love to believe what we can not imagine is true . We keep giving blood , out of faith that the rescue workers will yet find someone whose life it will save . The search dogs digging through the World Trade Center crypt have become so discouraged by their failure , day after day , to find anyone alive that rescue workers have taken to burying themselves under blankets and allowing the dogs to sniff them out and " save " them , while others watch and cheer and pat the dogs on the back . <P> If only they could do the same for the rest of us . We are all in the Third Tower now , the one built instantly from the rubble of the other two . We have been " awakened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes and seen the flames and are uncertain about what to do next . We 're told to go about our business ; we want to head for the stairs . When millions of us all imagine in the same week what we would say in our last cell-phone call to our family and friends , something in our lives , and our nation 's , has changed forever . <P> People diagnosed with a serious disease talk about how it rewires them , lifts them to a different place where every day is a gift  --  and you do n't know how many more you 'll get . So you are overwhelmed by your children 's skin and the taste of the garlic and the way the dirt smells on a rainy day , and you marvel at all the things you stopped noticing a long time ago . That is usually a private journey , shared with closest friends . We are now taking that trip together . <P> It has become a time of homecoming and housecleaning , of fathers calling their estranged sons and making confessions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past small grudges that do n't matter anymore and probably never did ; of couples renewing their vows and deciding it 's O.K. to go in late for work . Single twentysomethings in Manhattan whose families live far away have started having sleepovers , like in junior high . Eighty-year-old parents , the generation that thought it had won the Last Battle , call their grown children every night and cry . <P> And so President Bush faced a transcendent challenge Thursday night , to address a nation in all its grief and anger and confusion over what comes next . It 's hard to plan D-day against an enemy with no beaches and no borders , and when wise heads counsel that the most effective counterattack may be the least publicly satisfying kind  --  the quiet intelligence and financial and psychological warfare that can best " drain the swamp " where the terrorists hide . Would a large-scale attack demonstrate American resolve or play into the hands of those hoping to create a martyr ? " Not only do you need the courage of your convictions , " Adlai Stevenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doubts . "
