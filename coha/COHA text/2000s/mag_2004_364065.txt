The men of camp blessing know they are bait . They dangle far from the formidable , heavily fortified perimeters of other U.S. bases in Afghanistan . Instead of the hundreds or thousands of troops that are in the large encampments , there are only a dozen Green Berets from what is known as Operational Detachment Alpha ( ODA ) 936 and a smattering of Marines . But they are dangling far from safety to attract a big catch . " This is Osama bin Laden 's backyard , " says the team sergeant . " And part of the solution to tracking him is having guys like us out here in isolated areas . " <P> Several approaches are being tried to bring bin Laden and his lieutenants to ground . Pounding suspected sites is one , dramatized by the Pakistanis last week . Another is covert manhunts conducted by units like Task Force 121 , the group of U.S. commandos that aided the capture of Saddam Hussein last year and that has recently been deployed to Afghanistan . And , increasingly , the job of persuading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban leaders is being carried out in remote outposts like Camp Blessing along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan , where small groups of U.S. special forces live side by side with local tribesmen . By extending U.S. influence and trading favors with tribal leaders , the military hopes to shake out the kinds of tips that will finally squeeze bin Laden into the open . <P> U.S. special-forces commanders recently gave TIME access to Camp Blessing , located in Nangalam in eastern Afghanistan . The camp is so secret that it does n't even appear on U.S. military and embassy maps of bases in Afghanistan . Bin Laden reportedly was spotted within six miles of Nangalam a little more than a month ago . Villagers claim that a member of bin Laden 's family wed a local girl farther up the Pesch River . <P> Camp Blessing , named for Jay Blessing , a U.S. Ranger sergeant killed in November , is a test of the " ink-spot theory of counterinsurgency , " says Lieut . Colonel Custer ( no first names allowed ) , the special-forces commander for eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. brings stability to places like Nangalam , cooperation from locals will rapidly spread like ink through blotting paper . Since arriving three months ago , the men of ODA 936 have launched numerous reconstruction projects , ranging from new footbridges to schools and clinics . Villages that are neutral or friendly benefit from aid . Those that have n't given up weapons or that abet the insurgents receive none . " We 're generating the goodwill that engenders willingness to offer up information , " says Custer , " and if bin Laden shows up , then we 're ready to react . "
