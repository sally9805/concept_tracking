It 's hardly news anymore that Americans are just too fat . If the endless parade of articles , TV specials and fad diet books were n't proof enough or you missed the ominous warnings from the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association , a quick look around the mall , the beach or the crowd at any baseball game will leave no room for doubt : our individual weight problems have become a national crisis . <P> Even so , the actual numbers are shocking . Fully two-thirds of U.S. adults are officially overweight , and about half of those have graduated to full-blown obesity . The rates for African Americans and Latinos are even higher . Among kids between 6 and 19 years old , 15% , or 1 in 6 , are overweight , and another 15% are headed that way . Even our pets are pudgy : a depressing 25% of dogs and cats are heavier than they should be . <P> And things have n't been moving in a promising direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults was well under 50% , while the rate for kids was only a third what it is today . From 1996 to 2001 , 2 million teenagers and young adults joined the ranks of the clinically obese ( see " What Is BMI ? " ) . People are clearly worried . A TIME/ABC News poll released this week shows that 58% of Americans would like to lose weight , nearly twice the percentage who felt that way in 1951 . But only 27% say they are trying to slim down  --  and two-thirds of those are n't following any specific plan to do so . <P> It would n't be such a big deal if the problem were simply aesthetic . But excess poundage takes a terrible toll on the human body , significantly increasing the risk of heart disease , high blood pressure , stroke , diabetes , infertility , gall-bladder disease , osteoarthritis and many forms of cancer . The total medical tab for illnesses related to obesity is $117 billion a year  --  and climbing  --  according to the Surgeon General , and the Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physical inactivity could soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. And again , Americans recognize the problem . In the TIME/ABC poll they rated obesity alongside heart disease , cancer , AIDS and drug abuse as among the nation 's most pressing public health problems . <P> So why is it happening ? The obvious , almost trivial answer is that we eat too much high-calorie food and do n't burn it off with enough exercise . If only we could change those habits , the problem would go away . But clearly it is n't that easy . Americans pour scores of billions of dollars every year into weight-loss products and health-club memberships and liposuction and gastric bypass operations  --  100,000 of the latter last year alone . Food and drug companies spend even more trying to find a magic food or drug that will melt the pounds away . Yet the nation 's collective waistline just keeps growing . <P> It 's natural to try to find something to blame  --  fast-food joints or food manufacturers or even ourselves for having too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rooted deep within our genes . Obedient to the inexorable laws of evolution , the human race adapted over millions of years to living in a world of scarcity , where it paid to eat every good-tasting thing in sight when you could find it .
