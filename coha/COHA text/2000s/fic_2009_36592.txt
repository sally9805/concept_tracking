Home Invasion <p> Sun Myung Moon looked great in a bikini . <p> The sight did not inspire me to schedule gender reassignment , but it was undeniably engaging . As my eyes strayed to the other eight-by-ten glossies on the bedroom dresser , I found myself wondering if the arrangement was random or if there was some coded message in the way things had been laid out . <p> The buxom Sun Myung , sandwiched between a muu-muu 'd Pope Benedict and a severely hog-tied Clarence Thomas , floated directly over Jerry Falwell , who appeared to be reading the Bible while spanking a hefty , ball-gagged blonde with Choose Life branded across her coccyx . Of the four , Falwell was the only one who looked like he was enjoying himself . Maybe that was the message the home invader meant to convey : Party like Falwell ! Or maybe , in the manner of burglars who relieve themselves on the carpet after stealing your silverware , the message was the fact that they were able to leave anything at all . The message was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was , certainly , a lesson in Justice Thomas 's comportment . Despite the obvious pain and degradation , his expression was one of infinite patience . Gentle understanding . I had never been a fan , but his stoic bearing won me over . The man had nobility . <p> I basked in that thought for a moment , then reality clawed me again . My home invader might still be in my home . I cried out , feeling like an idiot , " I 'm a cop ! " That 's when I noticed a black and white photo , smaller than the others , wedged behind a dresser leg . <p> This one showed a smiling , gap-toothed fellow in a uniform . He might have been Jack Lemmon 's cousin , if Jack Lemmon 's cousin had a trim mustache and served in the SS . The twin lightning bolts on the lapels were a dead giveaway . The officer in the photo was in a laboratory , a forbidding nurse at his side . He clamped calipers in both hands , simultaneously measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left and right . Stamped under the shot , in block letters , was BeidhSndig . Below that , in a looping scrawl , someone had penned the translation : ambidextrous . <p> The ex-cop in me knew I should stop staring and deal with the situation  --  however it is you deal with strangers planting celebrity perv pics in your bedroom . But the image of that smiling SS man and his calipers was so disturbing , my eyes retreated to the puckish Moon . Why should n't the Korean messiah enjoy some dress-up ? Think what early Christians would have done if Jesus had been resurrected with cleavage ! <p> All speculation was shattered by a gravelly voice behind me . " They 're not real ! " Before I could react , something cracked the back of my head . I do n't remember going down . I only remember coming to , blinking away twirling stars , in a forced crouch . Trapped in a tiny aluminum jail . <p> " Christ ! " I cried . <p> " Him , I got no photos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in jail . I was cramped within the four legs of a walker . A heavily jowled old man waited for me to raise my eyes , then spat an inch from my knee . <p> " Putz ! " <p> I considered punching the senior intruder in the testicles . They were , in my Guantnamo crouch , at eye level , drooping prominently behind the shiny weave of his poly-blend Sansabelt trousers . <p> " What kind of schmohawk gets mugged by a seventy-two-year-old with a walker ? " <p> " Happens all the time . " I yanked myself up by a walker leg so that my new friend and I were jammed face-to-face , like two guys squeezed into a telephone booth . " Just last week an old lady brained me with her orthopedic cane , and the day before that some prick with Alzheimer 's kicked me down a flight of stairs , then forgot he did it and kicked me down another flight . " <p> " Oh , a funny guy . " <p> " That 's me , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hands off the grip and eased by him . The old man 's breath stank of sardines and horseradish . When he picked something fleshy off his tongue and flicked it at me , I slapped him . " That 's disgusting . " <p> My attacker rubbed his face , his mouth forming a smile that looked like it was made of other people 's lips . " How ' bout that , the kid 's not a complete pussy . " <p> I kicked the walker away and caught him when he fell forward . I was that tough . <p> " How about you shut the fuck up so I can decide whether to strangle you or not ? It 'd be legal  --  you broke in ! " <p> This seemed to make the jowly old man even happier . " So what 's stopping you ? " <p> " I 'm curious . You make a habit of hobbling around , planting bad tabloid shots in people 's houses ? There money in that ? " <p> The old guy spat out another fleck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pops . Stop hocking on my carpet . " <p> He spat again . This time when I tried to slap him , he caught my hand . His grip was a shock , but no more than his reflexes . He kept grinning until he let my hand drop . " Bad habit , " he said . <p> I winced , which I knew he 'd enjoy . Then I righted the fallen walker and handed it back it to him . " You still have n't told me about the pictures . " <p> " I got a job for you . " <p> " So that 's why you Walker Texas Rangered me ? " <p> " I wanted to get your attention . The pics are fakes . Photoshop . " <p> " Fuck the pictures . What are you doing here ? " <p> He shrugged . " You break into a man 's home , you want to give him a show . Ha ! " <p> The old man feinted left with a jab and cackled when I ducked . Enough strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strange " was fairly high . But this was getting up there . <p> " Okay , I lied , " the old man blurted . " They 're not all fakes . " <p> He tapped the gap-toothed SS man in my hand . <p> " This one is real . He 's the only one I 'm interested in . " <p> <br> Continues ...
