We all know you ca n't train a puppy in the presence of its mom , because it pays attention only to her . Imagine how much easier training would be if you could magically become your pup 's " mom . " Well , Dennis Hermesch , DVM , is doing just that with his German shorthair pups by weaning them at 4 1/2 to 5 weeks and becoming their whole world . This timing catches pups in the early stages of an enormous spurt of brain growth , but it 's at a point where they 're still heavily dependent on Mom to direct the neurons into making the right memory connections . " I held back a pup weaned at five weeks for more training , " Dr. Hermesch told me , " then turned it loose in a fenced pasture with its mother and another adult dog at eight or nine weeks . It did n't revert to seeing its dam as Mom , but paid attention to me . This attention transfers to new humans who pick them up at six weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their real mom served only milk , while he delivers a quality soft food three or four times a day . They 're out of the kennel and in the backyard , a new world . And they 're played with and petted like never before . A more serious play game , a wing on a string and pole , appeals to their instincts . They chase , they ca n't catch , and finally one stops and points . Others soon follow the lead . When the new owners come to get them , all are pointing , sometimes all at once . Apparently , the instinct to " back " or honor another dog 's point is being expressed and set in stone as well . These pups are separated from the dam and the litter a week apart , which is much less traumatic than experiencing both events on the same day . New owners report less nighttime crying . WINDOW OF LEARNING Each pup goes to its new home accompanied by a copy of my book Speed Train Your Own Bird Dog . Dr. Hermesch says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' natural instincts . Training must continue at once because this burst of surplus neurons does not last long . Nature decides that sufficient time has passed to connect enough circuits to function in life . A gene switches on and orders the production of enzymes that destroy surplus neurons and the weakest synapses . In humans , the brain 's greatest growth spurt is over by age 10 . A yearling dog compares to a 15-year-old human in potential maturity , so mathematically the window of time to appeal to a dog 's brain spurt is 8 months . Like humans , dogs can learn all their lives , but the rate and ease of assimilating information depends a lot on the number of circuits connected during the brain spurt . In my view , Dr. Hermesch has discovered a landmark addition in the making of superdogs . Buyers say his early weaned shorthairs are exceptionally easy to train , and that they automatically carry the mom attachment to the field , never self hunting , always in touch with " Mom .
