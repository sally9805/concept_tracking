Kent , 1812 <p> Late-night visitors were never good news . Lady Agnes Westerfield woke to banging on the door of her private wing of sprawling Westerfield Manor . Since her servants slept two floors above and she wanted to stop the racket before it woke her students , she slid into her slippers and wrapped herself in a warm robe . <p> Her candle cast unsettling shadows as she made her way to the door . Soft , steady rain hissed against the windows , punctuated by two deep gongs from the hall clock . <p> Among the quiet hills of Kent , robbers were unlikely to knock on her front door , but she still called , " Who 's there ? " <p> " Randall . " Recognizing the familiar voice , she swung the door open . Her heart sank when she saw the three tall young men on her front steps . <p> Randall , Kirkland , and Masterson had been part of her first class of students-her " lost lords " who needed special care and education . There had been six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than brothers . One had been lost in the chaos of France ; another was in Portugal . Having three of the others show up with anguish in their eyes did not bode well . <p> She gestured them inside . " Is it Ballard ? " she asked , voicing a worry she 'd had for months . " Portugal is a dangerous place with the French army running amok . " <p> " Not Ballard . " Alex Randall stepped inside and removed his rain-soaked cloak . He limped from a wound he 'd received on the Peninsula , but he was still ridiculously handsome in his scarlet army uniform . " It 's ... it 's Ashton . " <p> Ashton was the sixth of their class , the most enigmatic , and perhaps dearest of them all . She braced herself . " Dead ? " <p> " Yes , " James Kirkland answered flatly . " We learned the news at our club and immediately rode down here to tell you . " <p> She closed her eyes , despairing . It was n't fair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had learned early that life was n't fair . <p> An arm went around her shoulders comfortingly . She opened her eyes and saw that it was Will Masterson , solid and quiet but always knowing the right thing to do . " Did you come together to support me if I went into shrieking hysterics ? " she asked , trying to be the calm headmistress they had known for so many years . <p> Masterson smiled wryly . " Perhaps . Or perhaps we wanted comfort from you rather than vice versa . " <p> That was the underlying truth , she guessed . None of her young gentlemen had had decent mothers , so she 'd taken that role in their lives . <p> A yawning maid appeared and Lady Agnes ordered food for her guests . Young males always needed feeding , especially after a long ride from London . When they 'd hung their dripping cloaks , she led them to the salon . They all knew the way , for they had been frequent visitors even after finishing their schooling . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you pour ? " Lady Agnes said . <p> Silently Randall opened the cabinet and drew out four glasses , the lamplight shining on his blond hair . He was taut to the point of shattering . <p> She accepted a filled glass and sank into her favorite chair . The brandy burned , but it sharpened her wits . " Tell me what happened . An accident ? " <p> Kirkland nodded . " Ashton was never sick a day in his life . " He looked a decade older than usual . " Is Miss Emily here ? She will need to know , too . " <p> Lady Agnes shook her head , wishing that her longtime companion and friend was present so they could mourn together . " She is visiting family in Somerset and wo n't be back for a week . General Rawlings is also away . " <p> She contemplated her glass , wondering about the propriety of drinking herself senseless . She never had , but this would be a good time to start . " He was my first student , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be no Westerfield Academy . " She did n't notice that she had slipped into using the late duke 's personal name rather than his title . <p> " How did that happen ? I never heard the story . You know how Ash was . When it came to his private life , he 'd make an oyster look chatty . " As Masterson spoke , the maid returned with a heavily laden tray . <p> The young men fell on the sliced meats , cheese , bread , and pickled vegetables like wolves . Lady Agnes smiled as she poured claret for everyone , glad she could do something for their bodies if not their spirits . <p> Randall glanced up . " Tell us how it all began . " <p> She hesitated , then realized that she wanted-needed-to talk about how she 'd met the very young Duke of Ashton . " Emily and I had just returned from our traveling years . Though I loved visiting so many faraway places , it seemed like time to come home . My father was unwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't matter . <p> " After three months back in England , I was champing at the bit , wondering what to do with myself . I 'd already sorted out the steward here at Westerfield Manor , and I needed a challenge . A pity women are n't allowed in Parliament . " <p> Kirkland looked up from his sliced beef with a smile . " I would love to see you speak to the House of Lords , Lady Agnes . I daresay you 'd sort them out in no time . " <p> " I found a better use for my energy . One day I was strolling through Hyde Park and wondering what to do with myself when I heard a whip cracking . Thinking someone was beating a horse , I went into the shrubbery and found a dreadful little man cursing up a tree . Perched on one of the branches over his head was Ashton , clutching the most indescribable puppy . " <p> " Bhanu ! " Masterson exclaimed . " I still miss that dog . How on earth did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why ? " Kirkland asked . <p> " The man was Ashton 's tutor , a fellow called Sharp . To be fair , Ashton was driving the man to distraction , " she said judiciously . " He refused to speak English or look anyone in the eye . His only friend was this filthy puppy he 'd found somewhere . Sharp ordered the puppy killed , but the groom assigned the job could n't bear to do that , so he released Bhanu in Hyde Park . When Ashton found out , he ran away from Ashton House to find his dog . " <p> " And he would n't quit until he succeeded , " Randall murmured . " Stubbornest man I ever met . " <p> " You should talk ! " Kirkland exclaimed . <p> Laughter at the comment lightened the atmosphere a little . Lady Agnes continued , " When I appeared and asked what the trouble was , Sharp poured out all his frustrations on me . He 'd been assigned the task of preparing the boy for Eton . <p> " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new Duke of Ashton was a lackwit who could n't speak English and certainly could n't attend Eton . The boy was a vile limb of Satan ! He was the wrong duke ; the title should have gone to his decent English cousin ! But the boy 's fool of a father had been a cousin who never thought he 'd inherit , so he married a Hindu slut while stationed in India . When the other heirs died , our Ashton ended up with the title , to the horror of everyone in the family . " <p> There was a collective gasp around her . " I 'm amazed Ash did n't go after his tutor with a knife , " Masterson breathed . <p> " I was tempted to take the whip away from Sharp and use it on him . " Instead , she 'd gazed into the tree and seen stark misery on the boy 's face as the tutor raved . The child understood every word and knew that he was despised . <p> In that moment , he 'd captured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different-an outcast in the society to which one was born . This small boy with the startling green eyes needed an ally . " Ashton had been treated with contempt by those around him ever since he was taken from his mother in India and shipped back to England . No wonder he was hoping that his horrible new life could be wished away . " <p> Her gaze went to each of the men in turn . " And that , gentlemen , was when inspiration struck and the Westerfield Academy was born . I used my grandest voice to announce that I was Lady Agnes Westerfield , daughter of the Duke of Rockton , and that I owned an academy for boys of good birth and bad behavior . I also claimed to have learned ancient methods of discipline during my travels in the mysterious Orient . <p> " Sharp was intrigued , and we struck a bargain . If I could get Ashton out of the tree and behaving civilly , Sharp would recommend to the trustees that the boy be sent to my academy rather than Eton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dredged up the Hindi I 'd learned during my time in India , and asked Adam to come down . " She smiled fondly at the memory . <p> " Of course he spoke perfect English-I was sure he must have learned the language from his father . But since I made the attempt to address him in Hindi , he decided that it was time to come down from the tree and deal with the world around him . " He 'd had tears on his face when he 'd reached the ground , but that she would never tell anyone . " Though I spoke the language badly , at least I was trying . He and I struck a bargain of our own . He was willing to come to my new school if he was allowed to keep Bhanu and continue the study of mechanics , which he 'd begun with his father . <p> " I thought that sounded perfectly reasonable . In return , I would expect him to apply himself to all his studies and learn how to play the role of English gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be his own . Torn from the land of his birth and his mother , he had needed to know that . <p> " Then I went in search of other students . You all know how you came to Westerfield . " The English peerage had no shortage of angry , frustrated boys who did n't fit the pattern expected of them . Randall , for example , had managed to get himself expelled from Eton , Harrow , and Winchester , the three most prestigious public schools in Britain . She believed that his feat was unmatched . <p> The parents and guardians of her first class had been grateful to find a respectable school that would take their problem boys . Lady Agnes 's sprawling estate was well suited to become a school , and her high birth had been a powerful lure . So was her recruitment of General Philip Rawlings . The general 's military reputation was stellar , and parents assumed he would rule with an iron hand . <p> Instead , the general shared her belief that violence should never be a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accepted her offer with enthusiasm . With her connections among the beau monde and his ability to command boys without ever raising his voice , they had created a unique school . <p> Within a year , other parents were begging for places at the school , and subsequent classes were larger . Lady Agnes had become expert in alluding to her mysterious oriental ways of creating well-educated and well-behaved young gentleman . <p> In fact , her methods were n't at all mysterious , though they were unconventional . When she first met with a boy , she found out what he most wanted , and most hated . Then she arranged for him to have what he wanted , and not be forced to endure what he found unendurable . <p> In return , she required her boys to work hard at their studies and learn how to play the game of society . Once her students realized that they could play the roles expected of them without losing their souls , they did well . <p> Kirkland topped up everyone 's claret , then raised his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh Duke of Ashton and the finest friend a man could have . " <p> The others raised their glasses solemnly . Lady Agnes hoped the tears in her eyes did n't show in the dimly lit room . She did n't want to ruin her reputation . <p> After the toast , Kirkland said , " Now his cousin Hal is the eighth duke . Hal is the one who notified us , actually . He found us dining at Brooks , because he knew we would want to know as soon as possible . " <p> " Hal is a good fellow , " Masterson observed . " He was broken up by the news . Inheriting a dukedom is all very well , but he and Adam were friends . " <p> Lady Agnes had met Adam 's cousin Hal . He was indeed a decent fellow , though conventional . Life , and the Ashton title , would go on . She wondered if there was any special young lady who should be informed of Adam 's death , but he 'd never expressed interest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his private life , even with her . Well , the news would be public soon enough . <p> Realizing she had n't heard the full story about Adam , she asked , " What kind of accident did he die in ? Was he riding ? " <p> " No , he was testing his new steam yacht , the Enterprise , up near Glasgow , " Randall replied . " He and his engineers were making a trial run down the Clyde . They ended up steaming quite a distance . They had just turned to head back when the boiler exploded . The boat sank almost immediately . Half a dozen engineers and crewmen survived , but several others did n't make it . " <p> Masterson said gloomily , " Ash was probably in the engine room tinkering with the damned thing when it exploded . That ... would have been quick . " <p> She supposed that if Ashton could choose how to die , he 'd be pleased to go this way . He was surely the only duke in England with such a passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways . <p> Then she stopped and considered what had been said . " Has his body been found ? " <p> The young men exchanged glances . " Not that I 've heard , " Randall said . " Though our information might be incomplete . " <p> He might be alive ! Though she wanted desperately to believe that , she knew her thought was hope , not likelihood . And yet ... " So there is no proof that he is dead . " <p> " With the fire and the sinking of the boat in such difficult waters , his body might never be recovered , " Masterson said quietly . <p> " But he might have survived . " She frowned as she considered . " What if he was injured and came ashore some distance away ? In one of his letters , he told me how strong the currents are around the Scottish and Cumberland coasts . At the least , his ... his body might have been carried such a distance that it would n't be connected to a steam boat explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , " Randall said , his brows knit . <p> " Then why are you here instead of looking for him ? " Lady Agnes snapped . <p> They all stiffened at her sharp tone . There was a long silence before Masterson banged his wineglass down on the table . " That 's a damned good question . I was so shocked at the news that my brain ceased working . I 'm going to head north and find out what happened . The survivors will be able to tell us more . Maybe ... maybe there will be a miracle . " <p> Randall said grimly , " Not bloody likely . " <p> " Perhaps not , but at the least I 'll learn more about his death . " Masterson rose , swearing under his breath as he wavered from a combination of exhaustion and drink . <p> " And I 'll go with you , " Kirkland said flatly . He and Masterson turned their gazes to Randall . <p> " It will be a fool 's errand ! " Randall exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more bitter in the end . " <p> " Not for me , " Masterson retorted . " I 'll feel better for knowing I tried . Granted , it 's unlikely he survived , but there is some chance that his body will be found . " <p> Randall scowled . " Very well , I 'll join you . Ashton deserves our best efforts . " <p> " Then it 's decided , gentlemen . You may spend the rest of the night here and take fresh mounts from my stables . " Lady Agnes rose and caught their gazes , one after the other . Voice steely , she commanded , " And if Adam is alive , I expect you to bring him home ! " <p> Chapter Two Cumberland , Northwest England Two months earlier <p> By the time her tour of the house reached the drawing room , Mariah Clarke was giddy with happiness . " It 's wonderful !

" Finally we have a home . One worthy of you . " He glanced at her fondly . " As of today , you are Miss Clarke of Hartley Manor . " <p> Miss Clarke of Hartley Manor . That sounded rather intimidating . It was time to start acting like a young lady . She straightened and tied a loose knot in her long hair so she would look closer to her twenty-five years . Like Sarah . As a child , she had often been alone , so she 'd imagined that she had a twin sister called Sarah , who was always available to play . Always loyal . The perfect friend . <p> Sarah was also a perfect lady , which Mariah was n't . If Sarah were real , she would be impeccably dressed with never a hair out of place . There would be no missing buttons or grass stains from sitting on a lawn . She would always ride sidesaddle , never shocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm everyone from cranky infants to curmudgeonly colonels .
