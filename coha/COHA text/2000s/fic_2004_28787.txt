1 Everybody was surprised when Professor Yang suffered a stroke in the spring of 1989 . He had always been in good health , and his colleagues used to envy his energy and productiveness -- he had published more than any of them and had been a mainstay of the Literature Department , directing its M.A. program , editing a biannual journal , and teaching a full load . Now even the undergraduates were talking about his collapse , and some of them would have gone to the hospital if Secretary Peng had not announced that Mr. Yang , under intensive care , was in no condition to see visitors . His stroke unsettled me , because I was engaged to his daughter , Meimei , and under his guidance I had been studying for the Ph.D . entrance exams for the classical literature program at Beijing University . I hoped to enroll there so that I could join my fiancee in the capital , where we planned to build our nest . Mr. Yang 's hospitalization disrupted my work , and for a whole week I had n't sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . I was anxious -- without thorough preparation I could n't possibly do well in the exams . Just now , Ying Peng , the Party secretary of our department , had called me to her office . On her desk an electric fan was whirring back and forth to blow out the odor of dichlorvos sprayed in the room to kill fleas . Her gray bangs were fluttering as she described to me my job , which was to attend my teacher in the afternoons from now on . Besides me , my fellow graduate student Banping Fang would look after Mr. Yang too ; he was to take care of the mornings . " Well , Jian Wan , " Ying Peng said to me with a tight smile , " you 're the only family Professor Yang has here . It 's timefor you to help him . The hospital ca n't provide him with nursing care during the day , so we have to send some people there . " She lifted her tall teacup and took a gulp . Like a man , she drank black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll stay in the hospital for long ? " I asked her . " I 've no idea . " " How long should I look after him ? " " Till we find somebody to replace you . " By " somebody " she meant a person the department might hire as a nurse 's aide . Although annoyed by the way she assigned me the job , I said nothing . To some extent I was glad for the assignment , without which I would in any case go to the hospital every day . After lunch , when my two roommates , Mantao and Huran , were napping , I went to the bicycle shed located between two long dormitory houses . Unlike the female students , who had recently all moved into the new dorm building inside the university , most of the male students still lived in the one-story houses near the front entrance to the campus . I pulled out my Phoenix bicycle and set off for Central Hospital . The hospital was in downtown Shanning , and it took me more than twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , the air was sweltering , filled with the smell of burning fat and stewed radish . On the balconies of the apartment buildings along the street , lines of laundry were flapping languidly -- sheets , blouses , pajamas , towels , tank tops , sweat suits . As I passed by a construction site , a loudspeaker mounted on a telephone pole was broadcasting a soccer game ; the commentator sounded sleepy despite the intermittent surges of shouts from the fans . All the workers at the site were resting inside the building caged by bamboo scaffolding . The skeletonlike cranes and the drumlike mixers were motionless . Three shovels stood on a huge pile of sand , beyond which a large yellow board displayed the giant words in red paint : AIM HIGH , GO ALL OUT . I felt the back of my shirt dampen with sweat . Mrs. Yang had gone to Tibet on a veterinary team for a year . Our department had written to her about her husband 's stroke , but she would n't be able to come home immediately . Tibet was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains constantly -- it would take her more than a week to return . In my letter to my fiancee , Meimei , who was in Beijing cramming for the exams for a medical graduate program , I described her father 's condition and assured her that I would take good care of him and that she must n't be worried too much . I told her not to rush back since there was no magic cure for a stroke . To be honest , I felt obligated to attend my teacher . Even without my engagement to his daughter , I 'd have done it willingly , just out of gratitude and respect . For almost two years he had taught me individually , discussing classical poetry and poetics with me almost every Saturday afternoon , selecting books for me to read , directing my master 's thesis , and correcting my papers for publication . He was the best teacher I 'd ever had , knowledgeable about the field of poetics and devoted to his students . Some of my fellow graduate students felt uncomfortable having him as their adviser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I enjoyed working with him . I did n't even mind some of them calling me Mr. Yang , Jr. ; in a way , I was his disciple . Mr. Yang was sleeping as I stepped into the sickroom . He was shorn of the IV apparatus affixed to him in intensive care . The room was a makeshift place , quite large for one bed , but dusky and rather damp . Its square window looked south onto a mountain of anthracite in the backyard of the hospital . Beyond the coal pile , a pair of concrete smokestacks spewed whitish fumes and a few aspen crowns swayed indolently . The backyard suggested a factory -- more exactly , a power plant ; even the air here looked grayish . By contrast , the front yard resembled a garden or a park , planted with holly bushes , drooping willows , sycamores , and flowers , including roses , azaleas , geraniums , and fringed irises . There was even an oval pond , built of bricks and rocks , abounding in fantailed goldfish . White-robed doctors and nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing urgent to do . Shabby as Mr. Yang 's room was , having it was a rare privilege ; few patients could have a sickroom solely to themselves . If my father , who was a carpenter on a tree farm in the Northeast , had a stroke , he would be lucky if they gave him a bed in a room shared by a dozen people . Actually Mr. Yang had lain unconscious in a place like that for three days before he was moved here . With infinite pull , Secretary Peng had succeeded in convincing the hospital officials that Mr. Yang was an eminent scholar ( though he was n't a full professor yet ) whom our country planned to protect as a national treasure , so they ought to give him a private room . Mr. Yang stirred a little and opened his mouth , which had become flabby since the stroke . He looked a few years older than the previous month ; a network of wrinkles had grown into his face . His gray hair was unkempt and a bit shiny , revealing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upper lip and murmured something I could n't quite hear . Sitting on a large wicker chair close to the door , I was about to take out a book from my shoulder bag when Mr. Yang opened his eyes and looked around vacantly . I followed his gaze and noticed that the wallpaper had almost lost its original pink . His eyes , cloudy with a web of reddish veins , moved toward the center of the low ceiling , stopped for a moment at the lightbulb held by a frayed wire , then fell on the stack of Japanese vocabulary cards on my lap . " Help me sit up , Jian , " he said softly . I went over , lifted his shoulders , and put behind him two pillows stuffed with fluffy cotton so that he could sit comfortably . " Do you feel better today ? " I asked . " No , I do n't . " He kept his head low , a tuft of hair standing up on his crown while a muscle in his right cheek twitched . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure if I should talk more ; Dr. Wu had told us to keep the patient as peaceful as possible ; more conversation might make him too excited . Although diagnosed as a cerebral thrombosis , his stroke seemed quite unusual , not accompanied by aphasia -- he was still articulate and at times peculiarly voluble . As I wondered what to do , he raised his head and broke the silence . " What have you been doing these days ? " he asked . His tone indicated that he must have thought we were in his office discussing my work . I answered , " I 've been reviewing a Japanese textbook for the exam and --  " " To hell with that ! " he snapped . I was too shocked to say anything more . He went on , " Have you read the Bible by any chance ? " He looked at me expectantly . " Yes , but not the unabridged Bible . " Although puzzled by his question , I explained to him in the way I would report on a book I had just waded through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Stories from the Bible , published by the Press of Foreign Language Education . I wish I could get hold of a genuine Bible , though . " In fact , a number of graduate students in the English program had written to Christian associations in the United States requesting the Bible , and some American churches had mailed them boxes of books , but so far every copy had been confiscated by China 's customs . Mr. Yang said , " Then you know the story of Genesis , do n't you ? " " Yes , but not the whole book . " " All right , in that case , let me tell you the story in its entirety . " After a pause , he began delivering his self-invented Genesis with the same eloquence he exhibited when delivering lectures . But unlike in the classroom , where his smiles and gestures often mesmerized the students , here he sat unable to move a muscle , and his listless head hung so low that his eyes must have seen nothing but the white quilt over his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering his voice a little wheezy and tremulous . " When God created heaven and earth , all creatures were made equal . He did not intend to separate man from animals . All the creatures enjoyed not only the same kind of life but also the same span of life . They were equal in every way . " What kind of Genesis is this ? I asked myself . He 's all confused , making fiction now . He spoke again . " Then why does man live longer than most animals ? Why does he have a life different from those of the other creatures ? According to Genesis it 's because man was greedy and clever and appropriated many years of life from Monkey and Donkey . " He exhaled , his cheeks puffy and his eyes narrowed . A fishtail of wrinkles spread from the end of his eye toward his temple . He went on , " One day God descended from heaven to inspect the world he had created . Monkey , Donkey , and Man came out to greet God with gratitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were satisfied with life on earth . They all replied that they were . " ' Does anyone want something else ? ' asked God . " Hesitating for a moment , Monkey stepped forward and said , ' Lord , the earth is the best place where I can live . You have blessed so many trees with fruit that I need nothing more . But why did you let me live to the age of forty ? After I reach thirty , I will become old and can not climb up trees to pluck fruit . So I will have to accept whatever the young monkeys give me , and sometimes I will have to eat the cores and peels they drop to the ground . It hurts me to think I 'd have to feed on their leavings . Lord , I do not want such a long life . Please take ten years off my life span . I 'd prefer a shorter but active existence . ' He stepped back , shaking fearfully . He knew it was a sin to be unsatisfied with what God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' God declared without any trace of anger . He then turned to Donkey , who had opened his mouth several times in silence . God asked him whether he too had something to say . " Timidly Donkey moved a step forward and said , ' Lord , I have the same problem . Your grace has enriched the land where so much grass grows that I can choose the most tender to eat . Although Man treats me unequally and forces me to work for him , I wo n't complain because you gave him more brains and me more muscles . But a life span of forty years is too long for me . When I grow old and my legs are no longer sturdy and nimble , I will still have to carry heavy loads for Man and suffer his lashes . This will be too miserable for me . Please take ten years off my life too . I want a shorter existence without old age . ' " ' Your wish is granted . ' God was very generous with them that day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Man , who seemed also to have something to say . God asked , ' You too have a complaint ? Tell me , Adam , what is on your mind . ' " Man was fearful because he had abused the animals and could be punished for that . Nevertheless , he came forward and began to speak . ' Our Greatest Lord , I always enjoy everything you have created . You endowed me with a brain that enables me to outsmart the animals , who are all willing to obey and serve me . Contrary to Monkey and Donkey , a life span of forty years is too short for me . I would love to live longer . I want to spend more time with my wife , Eve , and my children . Even if I grow old with stiff limbs , I can still use my brain to manage my affairs . I can issue orders , teach lessons , deliver lectures , and write books . Please give their twenty years to me . ' Man bowed his head as he remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . " To Man 's amazement , God did not reprimand him and instead replied , ' Your wish is also granted . Since you enjoy my creation so much , I 'll give you an additional ten years . Now , altogether you will have seventy years for your life . Spend your ripe old age happily with your grandchildren and great-grandchildren . Use your brain wisely . ' " Mr. Yang paused , looking pale and exhausted , sweat glistening on his nose and a vein in his neck pulsating . Then he said dolefully , " Donkey , Monkey , and Man were all satisfied that day . From then on , human beings can live to the age of seventy whereas monkeys and donkeys can live only thirty years . "
