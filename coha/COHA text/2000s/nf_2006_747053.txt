Section : Innovations <p> Tibiofemoral forces determine polyethylene wear and affect the longevity of total knee prostheses . Previously , investigators relied on theoretic data from mathematical models to predict mechanical forces in the knee . Predictions of tibiofemoral forces are highly variable because of the complex interplay of the muscles involved in activities . Ideally , knee forces should be directly measured . An electronic total knee prosthesis ( e-Knee ) was developed to directly measure tibiofemoral compressive and tensile forces in vivo . After 13 years of research and development , the e-Knee was implanted into a patient in 2004 . Tibiofemoral force data were collected intraoperatively and throughout the postoperative period during activities of daily living and during exercise . Direct measurement of knee forces can lead to a better understanding of the stresses seen following total knee arthroplasty . Information generated by the e-Knee will aid in the improvement of implant design and patient care . Background <p> Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is a successful procedure for improving the quality of life of those afflicted with debilitating arthritic knee pain . Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the patient and the surgeon ; knee joint function and stability are increased with excellent relief from pain ( Kane , Saleh , Wilt , &; Bershadsky , 2005 ) . Although usually successful , TKA could be improved by increasing the longevity of the implants and by improving the rehabilitative process . Stresses at the articulation surface occurring between the tibial and femoral components ( tibiofemoral forces ) are a major factor in generating wear and radiographic lucency Tibiofemoral forces determine polyethylene wear , stress distribution in the implant and in the implant-bone interface , and stress transfer to the underlying bone . These factors all influence the longevity of the knee implant . Wear of the polyethylene insert can cause osteolysis , aseptic loosening , and ultimately TKA failure . Historically , mathematical models have been used to predict tibiofemoral forces . The theoretic estimates of tibiofemoral forces have varied between three and six times body weight depending on the mathematical models used and on the type of activity analyzed . Predicted forces across the knee joint do not always reflect actual forces due to the complex interplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideally , tibiofemoral forces should be measured directly in vivo . <p> Collection of in-vivo measurements of forces occurring from total knee prostheses would allow future improvements in implant design and postoperative rehabilitation . This information may clarify the benefits of preoperative treatments , such as lower extremity bracing , orthotics , and shoe design . An implantable telemetry system was developed to measure tibiofemoral compressive forces directly in vivo . This innovative system is called the e-Knee . The information generated by the e-Knee enables a direct comparison of measured joint forces with those that are theoretically predicted . The e-Knee has the potential to revolutionize both TKA research and practice . Development <p> Concept development of the e-Knee began at the Shiley Center for Orthopaedic Research and Education at Scripps Clinic in 1991 . Clinicians , scientists , and industry worked together to design the components inside the e-Knee and design the tibial implant to hold the necessary electronics . Cadaveric experiments were carried out in 1998 and 1999 with early prototypes . Intraoperative testing of the prototype was earned out in 2000 . In addition to providing revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as commercially available implant designs . Fatigue testing was done in 2001 , where implants were put through 10 million simulated walking cycles to test the implant strength . Four of the six implants broke midway through the test . Thus , the original design was modified to enhance safety . Successful fatigue testing was accomplished in 2003 . The final tibial prosthesis was instrumented with force transducers , a power induction coil , a micro-transmitter , and an antenna ( see Figure 1 ) . Force transducers , located at the four quadrants of the tibial tray , are capable of determining the vertical loads , the location of the center of pressure , and the tension forces . The induction coil allows for remote powering of the transducers and the electronic components , including the micro-transmitter . The micro-transmitter transmits force data via the antenna inside the implant to a compute ' where data are presented in a readable format ( Morris et al. , 2001 ) . With the final prototype developed and thoroughly tested , the lime had come to find the right candidate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone into the development of the e-Knee and only one implant was available for implantation . Therefore , selection criteria for subjects were stringent . It was imperative that the e-Knee be implanted into someone who would be capable of the post-operative activity tests planned . After going to the human subjects committee for approval and obtaining patient 's consent , the final e-Knee was implanted on February 27 , 2004 into a 67-kg , 80-year-old man with primary osteo-arthritis of the right knee . The selected candidate not only fit the body weight and age criteria but also surpassed the activity requirements . He is a retired engineer who is well versed in metal strength and the testing of new devices . Implantation and Testing <p> The TKA surgery was performed through a standard mid-vastus approach without complications . An exciting moment was shared and history was made when reasonable balance between the medial and lateral soft tissues was confirmed by the information intraoperatively provided by the e-Knee . The proper functioning of the prosthesis was tested after implantation and tibial forces were recorded during passive flexion and extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postoperative day one , at various intervals during the first postoperative year . Activities of daily living were measured , including level walking , rising from and sitting down on a chair , and stair ascent and descent . In addition , forces were measured while exercising on a stair-climbing machine and on a stationary bicycle and while playing golf . Results <p> Peak tibial forces increased substantially over the first 3 weeks during rehabilitation and then more gradually during the rest of the year , up to 2.8 times body weight when walking on level ground ( see Figure 2 ) . The contribution of each of the four force transducers when walking on level ground can be seen in Figure 3 . In treadmill walking at 2.5 km/minute to 5 km/minute , the peak tibial forces ranged from 1.75 to 2.03 times body weight . Tibial forces during chair rise increased from 1.56 times body weight to 2.64 times body weight from the 6-week post-operative period to the 1-year follow-up , respectively . Stand-to-sit activity generated greater tibial forces than rising from a chair at the 1-year postoperative period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 times body weight , whereas sitting down in a chair produced forces of 3 times body weight . Exercising on a stair-climbing machine resulted in peak tibial forces that ranged from 1.94 to 2.14 times body weight even when the level of difficulty was increased from level 1 to level 4 . Forces at the 1-year postoperative period were lower by 1 times body weight during stationary bicycling through a range of pedaling rates and levels of difficulty , which confirms that stationary bicycling is a relatively safe exercise for patients who have undergone TKA . Overall , the tibial forces recorded during walking and stair climbing were lower than most predicted values generated from mathematical models . A detailed report of the tibial forces measured in vivo during activities of daily living and during exercise was provided previously ( D'Lima , Patil , Steklov , Slamin , &; Colwell , Jr. , 2005 ) . Discussion <p> The knee is a complex joint that is difficult to model accurately . Measurement of knee forces can lead to a better understanding of the stresses seen in TKA . Better measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate and implement improvements in implant design and patient care . Until recently , knee forces have been predicted by mathematical models with variable outcomes . The e-Knee is the first device with the ability to measure in vivo tibiofemoral forces , a technological breakthrough , with the promise of aiding in the modification of implant design , intraoperative decisions , postoperative rehabilitation programs , and assistive devices ( Morris et al. , 2001 ) . The first e-Knee was implanted in a patient 2 years ago . Tibiofemoral force data have been collected intraoperatively and throughout the postoperative period during activities of daily living and during exercise . In-vivo forces have been compared with theoretical joint forces . Data are currently being collected during more strenuous and athletic activities . Thirteen years of research and development have proved successful . The Future <p> Scientists have developed the next generation e-Knee with the ability to measure shear and torque forces in addition to tibiofemoral compression and tension forces . The addition of shear and torque force data to compression and tension force data should lead to a more comprehensive understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative device include implanting the new e-Knee design into more diverse patients who have undergone TKA . Implanting the new e-Knee into a few more patients should produce results more indicative of the general TKA population and hold greater external validity than a sample size of one . With more information , implant designs , rehabilitation programs , and assistive devices may be best tailored to different TKA candidate subpopulations . Current nursing care may not be directly affected by the data collected from the e-Knee . Postoperative care of the e-Knee patient does not differ from that of any other patient who has undergone TKA , except for the testing done by the research team while the patient is in the hospital . However , we noted that knee forces went up to the equivalent of 30% body weight during passive leg raising in bed . Nurses should be aware that passive leg raising , which is traditionally assumed to generate minimal forces in the knee , may in fact trigger a painful response . Active leg raising in bed generated forces equivalent to 70% of body weight . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the patient 's pain is under control , encouraging the patient to do active leg raises in bed is a useful preconditioning exercise before weight bearing . Information generated by the e-Knee may help nurses educate patients who have undergone TKA about activities that can be done without excess stress on the knee . For example , nurses can now confidently encourage their patients to ride a stationary bicycle and walk on a treadmill during the rehabilitation period . Nurses can inform their patients that greater knee stresses will be experienced when transitioning from standing to sitting in a chair and when descending stairs compared with the stresses experienced when transitioning from sitting in a chair to standing and climbing stairs . Future plans for the e-Knee include research for development of orthotics and knee braces for patients who have undergone TKA . The e-Knee has revolutionized TKA research . Knowledge of the forces generated in the knee both perioperatively and during rehabilitation with activities of daily living and physical exercise will support the evidence-based evolution of TKA .
