<p> It 's a bleak Monday evening in February and a thick , damp snow is falling on the streets of New York City 's East Village . The few pedestrians appear to be making rapid tracks for home . But inside the Roberto Clemente Community Center , no one is rushing . Instead , about 18 eager seekers are clustered around a long table , searching Plato 's " Republic " in contemplation of the question " Why be moral ? " Melting snow is still dripping off their jackets , but their faces are a picture of concentration . These students are the beneficiaries of a program with a quixotic goal : to transform society by bringing the liberal arts to those without financial means . Enrollees in the Bard College Clemente Course in the Humanities include dropouts , former inmates , homeless people , new immigrants . Offered in 12 US cities , it focuses on the " great books , " the Western canon of culture , philosophy , and literature . The curriculum is a bit out of step with the pragmatic approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and parents ) want to see a direct correlation between education and earning power . But Clemente 's founder , New York <p> author Earl Shorris , believes this traditional core of knowledge is exactly what 's needed to help expand mental horizons , sharpen thinking skills , and promote greater reflection . He calculated that strengthening the inner lives of individuals would also be a means of improving their outward conditions . " This is for people who for one reason or another have been shut out of the educational system , " says Robert Martin , associate dean of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson , N.Y . For the students , many of whom are encountering Plato and Shakespeare and Dante for the first time - the course " is about a door opening , " he says . Take Francisco Correa , an immigrant from Mexico who says he had always dreamed of becoming well educated but did n't see the means of pursuing that goal until he found this class .

Those who complete the course work earn six college credits . The only requirements for admission are an interest in studying the liberal arts and an income no more than 150 percent of the federal poverty level . <p> ' The moral life of downtown ' In the early 1990s , Mr. Shorris was visiting a New York prison to research a book , and he asked a female inmate what she believed needed to be done to break the cycle of poverty . " You 've got to teach the moral life of downtown to children , " she told Shorris . In other words , children in low-income areas need exposure to plays , museums , concerts , and lectures . The comment struck Shorris as profound , and in thinking about the power of the " moral life " of culture , he conceived the idea of bringing the humanities to adults who may never have had a chance to experience them . With the backing of Bard College , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first class at the Clemente center in 1995 . That 's why the now-national course shares the name of the beloved Pittsburgh Pirate baseball player honored by the community center . The original participants were attracted to the program by notices placed in public libraries , community centers , and homeless shelters . " It 's fascinating that the course is both a very conservative and a very radical idea at the same time , " says Mr. Martin . " The canon is old-fashioned , but providing it to this group is a very new idea . " Many of the ideas that inspired Shorris - the notion of shaping a better citizenry through exposure to culture , for instance - come directly from Plato and Aristotle , Martin says . <p> Steppingstone to college The class is taught two evenings a week throughout the school year , covering literature , art history , moral philosophy , history , and writing . Students must attend classes , keep up with the readings , and write papers . Of the 450 who took the Clemente course in its first five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college credit . Of those , 179 have gone on to college of some sort or plan to do so in the near future . Nine have attended Bard College on full scholarships . The program is now in its sixth year and is offered at 14 sites in such cities as Seattle , Philadelphia , Washington , Atlanta , and Fairbanks , Alaska . For funding , it relies on two grants from the US Department of Education , in addition to private foundations . Some participants have already attended college , although often their experiences were interrupted by immigration or financial setbacks . Many are former prison inmates who may have had little opportunity for college courses . ( Funding for education in prisons has almost entirely disappeared in recent years ) . A significant portion of Clemente students have had little exposure to academic pursuits in any fashion , and need considerable support to learn to keep up . That 's one reason a writing course is now interwoven with the other liberal-arts disciplines . <p> Transformation <p> Martin Kempner , who formerly taught philosophy at Rutgers University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national director . He also teaches at the original site in New York . Dr. Kempner says involvement with the program has offered him the chance to see the transformative power of the liberal-arts experience in the lives of the students he works with . " Some go on to college , but even if they do n't , studying these works captivates the imagination and stretches the mind and challenges them as people , " he says . He remembers one student recently released from jail who enrolled in the course in search of a mental grounding that would prevent him from returning to crime . At the end of the course , he told Kempner that he felt the study of philosophy and art history had transformed him , first by the example of Socrates , whom he read about in the " Republic , " and second by filling his thought with new and improved subject matter . " Now when I walk around New York and look at the buildings , I understand the architecture .

The Notre Dame Great Books course is shorter and is offered only to residents of a local homeless shelter . It focuses on works by such writers as Shakespeare , Montaigne , and Melville , and the professors involved say they see such books work magic in the students ' lives . " We make art and culture available and with just a little bit of help the students fall in love , " says Clark Power , chair of the Program of Liberal Studies at Notre Dame . " I 've gained myself in appreciating what the arts give to our shared sense of humanity , " he says . Many teachers of these types of classes say they appreciate the gratitude and enthusiasm their adult students bring to their studies .

Mr. Castro says he 's thrilled at this chance to get college credits for free , but his pleasure extends beyond the thought of economic opportunity . " I like the whole learning experience , " he says . " I love the intellectual stimulation . You can never learn enough . " <p> E-mail marjorie@csmonitor.com <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
