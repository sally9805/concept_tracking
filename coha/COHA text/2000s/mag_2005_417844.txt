Across America , some people study the Civil War in a special way . They relive it . // White smoke crept over a green field . The smoke teased people 's eyes and noses . And it seeped into their clothes . Standing in the smoke were some 5,000 reenactors . Those are people who act out past events . They came to western Virginia to act out the Battle of Cedar Creek . It was a turning point of the Civil War . That struggle tore America apart during the 1860s . For the reenactors , the 1864 battle was as real as the white smoke . " You actually get into the past , " explained Lynn Peterson . Acting out the past , she said , is a great way to bring history to life . Across America , countless other people feel the same way . The reenactors worked hard to get every detail right . Indeed , Cedar Creek looked as if time had stopped long ago . Tents stood in neat lines . Cooking pots simmered over campfires . Soldiers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A House Divided It may be hard to imagine that Americans went to war against one another . But they did . , How could this happen ? The answer lay in differences between the states . Northern states were fairly industrial . Many people worked in factories or shops . The South was mainly agricultural . Most people worked on farms . They grew cotton , rice , sugarcane , tobacco , and other crops . Raising those crops was hard work . To do it , some Southerners used African-American slaves . A slave is a person legally owned by another person . By 1860 , nearly four million slaves worked in the United States . Throughout the 1800s , Americans argued bitterly about slavery . Should they allow it in new states as the country grew ? Could slavery continue in the South ? Northerners and Southerners disagreed sharply about what to do . Somehow , though , Americans managed to stick together-barely . An Uncivil War The country broke apart in 1860 . Abraham Lincoln was elected President . He opposed the spread of slavery .

Its people and soldiers were known as Confederates . President Lincoln refused to let the Union , or country , split up . He said he would even use force to keep the South from seceding . In response , Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina . War began . From 1861 to 1865 , the North and South fought fiercely . Three million soldiers served in the war . Keeping them fed was a big job . Confederate troops got much of their food from the Shenandoah Valley . That 's a region in Virginia . The South held the area for most of the war . Then came the summer of 1864 . Small Battle , Big Impact That summer , Union troops marched into the valley . They wanted to cut the Confederates ' food supply .

The Union won the battle . Cedar Creek affected the war in two big ways . The Union gained control over the Shenandoah Valley . The victory also cheered the weary North . In fact , the news probably helped Lincoln get reelected a few weeks later . The war lasted just months after Cedar Creek . In April 1865 , both sides met in a Virginia town . The South surrendered . Union soldiers began cheering , but their leader stopped them . " The war is over , " he said , " the rebels are our countrymen again . " Getting It Right October 2004 was the 140th anniversary of the Battle of Cedar Creek . Reenactors were excited to relive this event . As always , they tried to do it just right . Brian Barron knows that . Brian , you see , acted as a Confederate drummer . He also plays in the school band . But Civil War drummers held their sticks differently . It 's a small detail , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his drum the old-fashioned way . Megan Wright worked hard on details too . She learned the Virginia reel , waltz , and other 19th-century dances . And her old-style skirt reached the ground . Hoops pushed the fabric into a wide circle . " I love these outfits , " she said . " I 'd wear them to school if I could . " The Power of the Past Young or old , the reenactors marveled at the power of their shared effort . Grown men talked about the terror of facing line after line of enemy soldiers . Some moments cut too deep for words , said Lew Ulrich . " You think about folks dying on this same ground , " he continued . " One guy sat in his tent crying . That 's how much it affects you . " History can do that .
