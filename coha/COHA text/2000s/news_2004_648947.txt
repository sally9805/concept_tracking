<p> During the Yankees ' early-season slump , I went to a sports bar with a few friends to curse the Red Sox and cheer on the Yankees and their new quarter-billion-dollar third baseman . Rather than watch the game at home , we thought we would share our feelings with like-minded New Yorkers , of which there is no shortage . <p> It was n't a welcoming place  --  a cavernous space with a dozen large-screen televisions , ersatz team memorabilia on the walls , and Buffalo wings and fried food on the menu that we washed down with beer in plastic cups . No charm or character , no sense that someone who cared owned the joint . As the granddaughter of the renowned Manhattan saloonkeeper Toots Shor , I could n't help bristling at the anonymity of the place . <p> Unfortunately , to my generation these are the characteristics that define a sports bar . We gather at these markets of manufactured fellowship but divide into separate pods , organized around our common team loyalty . We cheer a second time when the instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow-motion glory . We talk back to the screen more than we talk to one another . <p> Television close-ups pass for an intimate relationship with our favorite players . The 60-inch screens are as near as we are likely to get to the major stars of our time . <p> How much we 're missing ! From the 1940 's through the 60 's , Toots Shor 's was a temple of sports celebrity , a home away from home for several generations of America 's sportswriters and athletes . The biggest stars of the day showed up regularly at Toots 's bar and restaurant , originally at 51 West 51st Street , to get a bearhug and a friendly insult from my grandfather . The place also attracted entertainers , politicians , mob bosses and , just as important , regular folks . The currency was conversation and a getting-to-know-you bonhomie . There was n't a single TV in the joint . <p> The other night at that antiseptic sports bar downtown , there was almost no mixing and very little true discussion . On one side of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side a pod of charcoal-suited power brokers . We shared the glow from the televisions and the one overworked bartender , but nothing else . <p> It 's hard for my generation to understand how different the world was when Toots Shor 's was the place to hang out . It is practically unimaginable now to think of athletes like Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle , Frank Gifford and Jack Dempsey  --  heroes to Toots and to our nation  --  heading to a public place after a game and mixing with sportswriters and fans . <p> Toots died when I was only 6 , and his saloon had closed for good by 1971 , so my memories of him are vague . I 'm now making a documentary about him , " Toots Shor : Bigger Than Life , " co-produced by Justin Weinstein . I have gotten an insider 's look at the social landscape of his era from a vast collection of photographs , his appearances on classic television shows of the 1950 's and an eight-hour oral history recorded two years before his death in 1977 . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned what made Toots Shor 's an icon of New York 's golden era . I 've also learned why it could never exist today . <p> Toots Shor 's was a destination because of Toots himself : big , boisterous and jovial , he was usually found with a brandy and soda greeting guests at the famed circular bar . Toots was a magnet , his kindness and generosity  --  and his insults  --  legendary . His straight-talking , no-nonsense style was a relief for those accustomed to being pandered to . In addition to athletes , Toots was proud to have known bishops , governors , Supreme Court justices and six presidents . <p> But what could a Jewish kid from South Philadelphia who worked his way up through mob-run speakeasies have in common with such accomplished and disparate men ? " My bond with those fellows was sports , " Toots said . <p> Toots felt sports were the backbone of American life , and any good citizen should have a devoted interest in them . He marked events in his own life by sports . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease on Sept. 15 , 1939  --  the day Galento beat Nova , in Philadelphia . " His first wedding anniversary ? " One of the biggest upsets in football happened that day , " he said of Nov. 2 , 1935 . " Notre Dame beat Ohio State . What a game ! Notre Dame scored two touchdowns in the last minute and a half of play . " <p> Toots Shor 's bridged ethnic and sociological gaps and built an alternate community where the tribes that ruled were the Yankees and Dodgers , Giants and Colts , Celtics and Lakers . It attracted sportswriters like Red Smith and Jimmy Cannon , as well as the athletes they covered . <p> The saloon was in its heyday during a time when New York was at its sporting apex . Madison Square Garden was king of the boxing world and the city 's baseball teams reigned supreme . In the 23 years from 1941 to 1964 , the Yankees were in the World Series 18 times , 7 against the Brooklyn Dodgers and once against the New York Giants . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shor 's would fill up  --  not just with fans , but with the players too . <p> After one game in 1945 , Toots rushed back from the Polo Grounds after watching Mel Ott hit his 500th home run . He arrived at his saloon to find Alexander Fleming , the discoverer of penicillin , at one of the tables . Toots introduced himself and chatted until Ott himself arrived , flush from his achievement . <p> " Excuse me , Sir Fleming , " Toots said , " but I got ta leave you . Somebody important just came in . " <p> Today , economics and celebrity have skewed the personal dynamic between sports stars , their scribes and their fans . <p> " When I was making $20,000 or $25,000 a year as a sportswriter , the players were making $20,000 or $25,000 a year , " Maury Allen said . " So if I went into Toots Shor 's and Mickey Mantle was there , I would buy Mickey a drink and maybe he would buy me a drink , or Toots would buy everybody a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods or an Alex Rodriguez , with his $252 million contract , knocking back drinks with one of us . It 's an impossible fiction . But back then , at Toots Shor 's , where it was an unspoken code not to bother anyone for an autograph , it happened all the time . <p> " This was a time when giants did n't just walk among us , they ate and drank and laughed and caroused among us , " Michael Hainey , deputy editor at GQ , said , " and here was the guy who they all wanted to be with , they all craved his friendship . " <p> I have inherited a lot from my grandfather . I value my friendships and family more than most other things in life . And , I love sports . Toots had season tickets for all the local teams , so I was thinking of him last weekend when I went out to Yankee Stadium to catch a game . After the brutal Boston beating , it was fun to share a big victory with other fans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have headed to Toots Shor 's , because there it was after the game ended that the real fun would begin . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com below , Bill Mark ) Toots Shor , above , owned a restaurant that drew celebrities from the 1940 's through the 60 's .
