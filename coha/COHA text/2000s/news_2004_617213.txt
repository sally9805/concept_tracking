<p> Jim Mora 's been on the job a little more than a month , and for all the Falcons fans who asked , " Who ? " when he was hired , a profile finally is emerging . It 's clear that he 's not your grandfather 's coach , nor your father 's . More like your son 's . <p> After all , how many other NFL head coaches are tight with the guys in Pearl Jam ? <p> " Lead singer Eddie Vedder and bassist Jeff Ament are huge sports fans , " Mora said . " Jeff had a 49ers sticker on most of the guitars he uses in concerts . I 've already sent him two Falcons helmet stickers . He 'll put them on there now . " <p> Score one for the power of persuasion , which quite simply is why Falcons owner Arthur Blank tabbed Mora to succeed fired coach Dan Reeves . If the Falcons ' new coach can persuade one of the world 's pioneering alternative rock bands to work as a billboard , well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a salesman , not that he likes that characterization . " I 'm not selling anything , " he said . <p> But the reality is that in the modern NFL , a head coach 's ability to pitch his plan matters a great deal . <p> With all the roster turnover driven by free agency and the salary cap , it 's difficult to overstock a team with talent . Conventional NFL wisdom says success today depends on players buying into a coach 's system , as did this year 's Super Bowl teams , New England and Carolina . <p> " It seems like regardless of the background of a player , he finds a way to connect , " said 49ers linebacker Jeff Ulbrich , who played the past four seasons for Mora . " He definitely sells players on a scheme and a philosophy . " <p> " JL has got natural charisma and enthusiasm around players , " said Saints defensive coordinator Rick Venturi , who was on the New Orleans staff with Mora in 1996 . " I think two things are really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-selling half a team on a yearly basis . Jimmy , I think , can do that . " <p> You 're also selling your boss  --  the team 's owner . Mora , after all , did not win this job based on cold facts : There were more experienced candidates available , and his unit 's statistics were never mind-blowing . <p> Yet Blank , co-founder of Home Depot , likes corporate structure , and Mora is sliding smoothly into place . Where Reeves might have blanched at the idea of appearing before the team 's board of directors , Mora might have them eating out of his hand in no time because , as his friend and Saints head coach Jim Haslett says , " Jim can spin . " <p> " The head coach of the 21st century is not someone smoking cigarettes , drinking coffee , watching 35 millimeter film , " said Mora 's agent , Bob Lamonte , who also represents coaches with names like Gruden , Fox , Reid , Sherman and Holmgren . " Today , to be a head coach in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring corporate leadership to the table in addition to coaching brilliance . " <p> Mora , then , is bringing it . <p> A lifetime 's preparation <p> " The reality is that Jim has been preparing for this position for his entire life , " Blank said in announcing Mora 's hiring on Jan. 9 . <p> He 's the third son to follow in his father 's footsteps as an NFL head coach ( the others were Don and son Dave Shula , and Bum and son Wade Phillips ) . <p> " I mean this sincerely ; he 's a lot better coach than I ever was , " said the father , James ( Jim ) Ernest Mora , who had a record of 125-113 as coach of the Saints ( 1986-96 ) and Colts ( 1998-2001 ) . " He has a lot more knowledge than I ever had at age 42 . " <p> The elder Mora 's first coaching job was at Occidental College , outside Los Angeles , from 1960-66 . That 's where his oldest son , James Lawrence , was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colorado , UCLA and the University of Washington . Then , onto the NFL 's Seahawks and Patriots before becoming head coach of the USFL 's Baltimore/Philadelphia Stars ( where young Jimmy , as his dad often calls him , worked in the ticket office on summer break ) , and then back to the NFL . <p> With a football passport stamped so many times , a kid learns to blend . <p> " That 's my background , " said the son . " It 's the way I grew up . My dad was a college football coach who recruited inner city L.A. , basically . Any barriers that might have been built up in terms of racial discrimination or profiling . . . they never existed in our house . Economic barriers , it just did n't matter . <p> " My dad 's background enabled me to meet owners , general managers , senators . Jack Kemp one of the elder Mora 's college roommates was one of my dad 's best friends . I 've been around a whole lot of people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those connections , Mora 's father says , " I did n't call anybody " to help his son into the NFL . <p> Rather , the younger Mora  --  unsure that he even wanted to coach  --  began his job quest while pursuing his degree at the University of Washington , where he played defensive back . <p> " I got a degree , but I could n't tell you if it was a B.S. or a B.A. , " he said . " I knew I wanted to be in athletics , I figured management . I applied to graduate school at USC , and I was going to be a graduate assistant there . <p> " I also sent letters to about half the GMs and some coaches in the NFL . I got back form letters . So I sent back a letter saying , ' Thanks for the form letter . ' " <p> Mora said only two men responded to his second missive . Coincidentally , one was Reeves , then the Broncos coach . <p> The other was Chargers general manager Johnny Sanders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at age 23 , Mora was in the NFL , basically as an errand runner in the player personnel department . <p> " I 'd do computer input , which was pretty new at the time . . . . Get the coaches ' dinner , " he said . " Anytime somebody took even one Coke out of the refrigerator , I 'd replace it . Or , if somebody ran 10 pages off the copy machine , I 'd put 10 pages back in . I did n't want anybody coming to me telling me to do something like that . " <p> Six games into the 1985 season , the Chargers fired their defensive coordinator and moved Mora 's boss , Dave Adolph , from the personnel department into that slot . <p> " I was really the only other one who knew the defensive hand signals that go in from the sideline , " Mora said . " Suddenly , I 'm on the field . And our first game was back at Seattle . I 'm telling all my friends , ' Yeah , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was a snot-nosed 23-year-old . " <p> The next season , Mora was given more responsibility . <p> " I 'm 24 years old , knocking on the doors of Dan Fouts , Charlie Joiner , Billy Ray Smith . . . doing bed curfew checks , " he said . " Dan and Kellen Winslow , they 'll never know how critical they were . Sometimes , if players see superstars making fun of you , you 're done . They treated me with respect . That gave me credibility . " <p> By 1989 Mora had worked his way up to secondary coach . He took the same job on his father 's staff in New Orleans in 1992 . " By then , I felt I had enough credibility , " he said . " If I had done that right out of college , it would 've looked like nepotism . " <p> Taught by 49ers legends <p> Mora was in New Orleans five seasons before taking over the 49ers ' secondary in 1997 . Two years later , he became defensive coordinator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He worked with former 49ers coach Steve Mariucci , and star players Steve Young , Jerry Rice and others , and former 49ers coach and icon Bill Walsh . <p> " I was able to be around guys who had a lot of rings , and did it the right way , and I was able to see how they worked , " Mora said . " To me , it 's not more important what others ' expectations are of you , but what your expectations are of yourself . " <p> Dad also was quite a teacher , sometimes without meaning to be . He had a few legendary , and very public , meltdowns as coach of the Saints and Colts . <p> " I had a few press conferences after games where I said some things I wished I could take back , " said the elder Mora , who now lives in Palm Springs , Calif . " I think Jimmy will handle things better than I did at times . But he 's got a little fire in his belly now . " <p> Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran footage of him raging on the sidelines during a game last fall against the St. Louis Rams . WSB 's Monica Kaufman suggested someone offer soap for his mouth . <p> " I have a shut-off switch that dad did n't , and that 's just because I watched him , " Mora said . " I have a temper , but I 'm never out of control . Against the Rams , I knew exactly what was going to happen . . . It was either going to be first-and-goal at the 2 or the 1 . <p> " We had the game won , and I did not want the Rams scoring . I was trying to make a statement . It worked . " <p> San Francisco defensive line coach Dan Quinn said , " There is an energy about him , an intensity in the way he prepares , the way he coaches . " Niners linebacker Ulbrich agrees : " You feed off his energy and emotion in games . " <p> Away from the sidelines , Mora carries a bag of football wares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has hundreds of videotapes of Pro Bowl and Hall of Fame players , scores of old playbooks , reams of handwritten notes  --  he 'll use any and all as a teaching tools . <p> He has a tape of Redskins linebacker Lavar Arrington yelling during a game at former Washington defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis , now the Bengals coach . <p> " There was a shot of Lavar . . . turning to the sideline and yelling  --  and you knew he was yelling at Marvin  --  ' What are we doing ? ' " Mora said . ' It just bothered me . I showed it to the players , and said , ' This will never happen on our football team , ever . It just wo n't because it will be the last time it will happen , you 'll be somewhere else . ' " <p> Yet Mora does n't come off as a my-way-or-the-highway kind of guy . Blank said months ago that he was looking for a coach , not a czar . His new coach fits in there , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are going to be disagreements , " Mora said . " We 're not always going to be 100 percent in agreement , and that 's OK because you do n't want a bunch of yes men . " <p> Head coach responsibility <p> His new job has also put a temporary crimp in his lifestyle . Mora has found it easy to carry his musical tastes  --  " It seemed like he 'd always be hooked up to his iPod , downloading music , " said Ulbrich  --  with him to Atlanta , but his other passions are on hold . <p> " This will be the first year I have n't skied since I was 6 ; too much going on at work , " he said . " That will be the thing I 'll miss most . " <p> He knows his chances to play his beloved beach volleyball will decline with the move . He 's an avid mountain biker , but his wheels are still in California . He wo n't move his stuff until late March or early April , when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 'll have a house big enough for all to have their own bedroom ( a result of a five-year , $7.5 million contract with the Falcons and a much softer housing market than in California ) . Currently , it 's two to a room in Los Gatos . <p> Cole , 9 , has been drawing diagrams of his room , and , " where he 's going to keep the lizard . . . . Where he 's going to keep his Game Boy , things like that , " Mora said . <p> Until the move , Mora is living at Emerald Pointe , a resort at Lake Lanier , and staying in touch daily with wife Shannon and their children : daughter Lilia , 7 ; and sons Cole , Ryder , 5 , and Trey , 16 months . <p> Mora is well versed in waiting for Shannon . His courtship of her , which began when both were at the University of Washington , was no whirlwind . <p> " She walked by and she just looked like the kind of girl I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , ' I 'm marrying her . ' It took me like six months to get a date with her . I knew where she was going to walk and when , and I 'd just be around the corner . " <p> Shannon never called the police , but probably could 've . <p> " I 'm surprised he admitted that because I said , ' Honey , there 's a term for that  --  it 's called ' stalking , ' " she said . " I got a friend to drive me to class one day , and he was kind of looking around a corner , and my friend said , ' He 's looking for you ! ' It was genuine . " <p> Perhaps , but they dated 11 years " before I got her to marry me , " Mora said . It 's little wonder Mora may be something of a protective husband in their 11-year marriage . <p> " My first year in San Francisco , Shannon was sitting in the stands , and some season ticket holder knew the defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting on her big-time , " he said . <p> " I went to to the front office and said , ' We have three options : Move him , move her , or I 'm going to Oakland , getting escorted into the most heavily drug-infested . . . area I can find and I 'm going to give someone 500 bucks to sit with Shannon the next game . And if this fan says a word , I 'll have him pummel the guy . <p> " They moved Shannon . " <p> Mora knows that being a head coach brings even more heat . To shield his young children , the family is likely to sit in a suite at the Georgia Dome . <p> " When a fan buys a ticket , they basically have the right to boo , cheer , scream , holler , do whatever they want , " Mora said . <p> " I just did not want my kids to be exposed to that . I did n't want them to lose perspective before they were able to understand perspective . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connie , father , and two younger brothers , speaking to them several times a week . <p> It was brother Michael who introduced Mora to Pearl Jam . Now an architect , Michael became friends with bassist Ament years ago when they worked together in a Seattle restaurant ( he designed the musician 's new home ) . <p> His youngest brother , Stephen , lives in Los Angeles , where he dabbles in acting ( he 's in that Bud Light commercial where a bird swipes bottles from terrorized cafe patrons ) . <p> They 'll all be around from time to time , although his father said he 'll pick and choose moments so as not to be a distraction . <p> Almost a complete fit <p> It seems that Mora fits all of Blank 's criteria for coaching his team : A guy who makes believers out of doubters , who has a passion for the game , and is committed to family . Yet he is not Blank 's kind of guy in one regard . Home Depot did not become a commercial titan on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my wife has a giant Halloween party for all the kids in the neighborhood , " Mora said . " Last fall I 'm up all night getting the house ready . . . . It 's like 3 in the morning , cold , and I 'm up on a ladder trying to staple a tarp up so she can have a haunted house . I jacked a staple right through my finger . <p> " I 'm not a home fixer . You know what I enjoy ? I enjoy pulling weeds and hosing down my driveway . It 's like Zen . It 's so mindless , and you see results immediately . " <p> Blank hopes his current company , the Falcons , can ride Mora 's back to immediate results . <p> * Age : 42 <p> * Personal : Son of former Saints and Colts head coach Jim Mora . . . .
