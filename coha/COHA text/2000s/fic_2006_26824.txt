Henderson , Nevada Later that morning " Do n't talk to me about bigotry , xenophobia , or racism , " Bob O'Rourke said even before the country-western bumper music faded completely away . " Do n't you dare call this show and call me a racist . I 'm mad enough to chew nails right now , my friends , and I might just lose my temper . " Fand Kent , Bob O'Rourke 's producer and call screener on the top-rated nationally syndicated talk radio show The Bottom Line , smiled broadly as she turned the gain down on her headphones . If you looked up the term type-A personality in the dictionary , you might find Bob O'Rourke 's picture there . He was always headstrong , dynamic , animated , energized  --  but he was even more so behind the microphone . During their one-hour production meeting before each show in Bob 's office , he had the usual array of national newspapers stacked up on his desk and his ever-present tablet PC notebook ready to take electronic notes , but today when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers on the floor , and crumpled up and tossed toward the wastebasket . Bob O'Rourke 's loud , deep , rapid-fire voice with just a slight Texas twang in it was exactly opposite of his physicalappearance , which Bob carefully worked to conceal ( and which cost the jobs of a few other producers when they slipped up and released unflattering descriptions of their boss ) : he was five six and weighed one-forty soaking wet , with thin black hair , a thin neck , very light skin , despite living in a town with eleven months of sunshine a year , and rather delicate-looking features . He was so self-conscious of his physical stature that he wore a cowboy hat , boots , and sunglasses all the time , even in the studio , and had trained his voice to become deeper . Some might call it a " Napoleon complex , " others might call it ego and vanity carried to the extreme . Fand Kent knew enough to keep her mouth shut whenever that subject was broached . You never knew when a rival producer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friends , " O'Rourke went on , " this attack , this assault , this brutal assassination is every bit as serious and troubling as the terror attacks in San Francisco , Houston , and Washington in recent months . Do n't give me that look , Fonda . Do n't you dare roll your eyes at me ! You know what I 'm talking about ! " Fand was busy with the phones and her computers and had n't even looked up at him , but it did n't matter  --  he constantly accused her of disagreeing with his comments and ideas , which were all part of the show . She was smart enough never to let him know her true opinions . " I know , I know , it 's not Fonda , it 's Fand , ' the Celtic goddess of truth , goodness , happiness , understanding , and Kumbaya , or some such nonsense that you were named after . To me , it sounds like Fonda , ' another liberal tree-hugging everyone be happy let 's all get along ' character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I 'm warning you , Fonda , the O'Rourke trap is open and you 're one step away from getting chomped , young lady . " Fand only shook her head and smiled as she went about her work . " I am not talking about numbers of dead or injured , my friends , " he went on to his worldwide radio audience . " I 'm not talking about weapons of mass destruction . I am talking about the enormity of the attack , the audacity , the sheer brazenness of it . You liberals think that an attack against the United States has to kill hundreds or thousands of persons , or law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty are n't to be considered victims of an attack . ' Well , my friends , I do n't . " In case you do n't know what I 'm talking about here , in case you 've been living under a rock or hugging a tree or counting snail darters in Lake Mead with your head underwater and your brains up your butt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , " O'Rourke went on . " Yesterday evening , four United States Border Patrol agents were gunned down just off Interstate 10 between Blythe and Indio , California . No , wait , just hold on . Gunned down ' is too soft , too gentle , too Fonda . Let 's call it what it was : they were slaughtered . They were shot to death by automatic gunfire as they were making an immigration stop . These men were executed . And for what ? For enforcing the immigration and border security laws of the United States of America , that 's what . " The assassins did n't stop there , my friends , oh no , not by a long shot . They killed a total of ten Mexican nationals , including a pregnant woman and an eleven-year-old boy . The killers then made off with a Border Patrol vehicle . Incredible . Simply incredible . Horrifying is more like it . This is the worst killing in the line of duty in the history of the Border Patrol . " As if he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a handful of chocolate-covered espresso beans and popped them into his mouth before continuing : " So what 's the status of the hunt for the killers ? I called Mr. James Abernathy , director of U.S. Customs and Border Protection , the folks who run the Border Patrol . He said he could not comment because of the ongoing investigation . Same response from Attorney General Wentworth . Fair enough . I 'm not going to aid and assist the terrorists by pushing the investigators into revealing any clues that might make the killers scatter . " But I asked both gentlemen what 's being done to secure our borders and prevent another attack like this from happening again , and do you know what they said ? Mr. Abernathy 's spokesperson said , We 're doing everything possible . ' Attorney General Wentworth 's spokesman said , Everything legally authorized is being done , with all due respect for the rights of those involved in this activity . ' Excuse me ?
