" The Black List " // In the midwinter of 1945 , the war in Europe had reached its final stages . Germany was crumbling under continued heavy Allied bombing . Cities were being obliterated , magnificent buildings reduced to stone , sand , and lime . The massive Allied raids had demolished towns and cities on such a scale that Bomber Command was running out of significant targets . The attack on the Western Front was unrelenting , the dark shapes of Allied soldiers slowly advancing across occupied lands . The Rhine would soon be in Allied hands . From the east , with an unstoppable fury , the Soviets were approaching . In January 1945 , the Red Army launched a massive offensive as 180 divisions overran Poland and East Prussia . Berlin was in their sights . // Right in the path of the advancing Soviets , at Peenem ? nde on the Baltic coast , lay a hidden village housing some five thousand scientists and their families . Discreetly obscured by dense forests at the northern tip of the island of Usedom , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being developed . The trees ended suddenly to reveal a chain-link fence and a series of checkpoints . At the local railway terminal , a notice reminded passengers : " What you see , what you hear , when you leave , leave it here . " Across a stretch of water known as the Peene River , a large village could be seen . It looked like an army barracks with regimented rows of well-built hostels . The sound and smell of the sea were never far away but remained invisible . About half a mile farther on , hidden among the trees , was a scene from science fiction at the very cutting edge of technology , known as " Rocket City . " // The world 's largest rocket research facility was created by a young aristocrat named Wernher von Braun . At thirty-two , he was head of rocket development for the German army . A natural leader , he possessed the " confidence and looks of a film star  --  and knew it , " according to one contemporary account , although what people remembered most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lifting the most ordinary of colleagues to a new appreciation of their worth . His organizational skills had turned Peenem ? nde into a modern annex of German weaponry . However , very few people were allowed to see beyond the practical engineer , who dreamed not of destructive weaponry but , improbably , of space . He was driven by the ambition of building a rocket that could achieve " the dream of centuries : to break free of the Earth 's gravitational pull and go to the planets and beyond . " He envisaged space stations that would support whole colonies in space . " In time , " he believed , " it would be possible to go to the Moon , by rocket it is only one hundred hours away . " But in Hitler 's Germany , he was forced to keep such visions to himself . These were plans for the future  --  a future that was increasingly in doubt . // Hitler had pinned his last hopes of saving the Third Reich on von Braun 's greatest achievement : a rocket known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed when they saw this strange vehicle for the first time . His technical assistant Dieter Huzel remembered being taken , in 1943 , to a vast hangar that loomed above the trees . Inside , the noise was deafening , a combination of overhead cranes , the whir of electric motors , and the hiss of compressed gas . It took a second for Huzel 's eyes to adjust to the strong shafts of sunlight , which cut across the hangar from windows high in the far wall . " Suddenly I saw them  --  four fantastic shapes but a few feet away , strange and towering above us in the subdued light . They fitted the classic concept of a space ship , smooth and torpedo-shaped . . . " Painted a dull olive-green , standing 46 feet tall and capable of flying more than 200 miles , the A-4 was the most powerful rocket in the world . " I just stood and stared , my mouth hanging open for an exclamation that never occurred . I could only think that they must be out of some science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space exploration , but to him , the rocket was an ultimate weapon that could save the Third Reich and prove German superiority to the world . In July 1943 , Wernher von Braun had been summoned to Wolfsschanze , the f ? hrer 's " Wolf 's Lair " in Rastenberg , East Prussia , to give a secret presentation . Walter Dornberger , the army general who ran rocket development at Peenem ? nde , had not seen Hitler since the beginning of the war and was " shocked " at the change in him . The f ? hrer entered the room looking aged and worn , stooping slightly as though carrying an invisible weight . Living in bunkers for much of the time had given his face the unnatural pallor of someone who spent his days in the dark . It was devoid of expression , seemingly uninterested in the proceedings , except for his eyes , which were worryingly alive , touching everything with quick glances . // Hitler 's original response to the rocket had initially hampered von Braun 's team . He simply refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-light , as he watched footage of the first successful launch of the A-4 shooting faster than the speed of sound over the Baltic Sea , his concentration became intense . With apparent satisfaction , he took in an impression of the blond , blue-eyed von Braun , a perfect specimen of his " master race " talking with uncontained enthusiasm as he outlined technical details of assembly , mobile launching facilities , and testing . Here was the perfect terror weapon that could carry a one-ton war-head , could be launched from any location , and was undetectable on approach . // As von Braun finished his presentation , it was clear that Hitler had been greatly affected . His former listlessness vanished as he fired questions with increasing excitement . He had found the weapon that could win him the war . " Why could I not believe in the success of your work ? " he said to Dornberger . " Europe and the rest of the world will be . . . " //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
