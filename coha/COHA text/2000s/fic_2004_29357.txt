The track in the woods was a wide causeway to the two boys strolling down it . Both were so dirty with thick , black mud as to be almost unrecognizable as human . The taller of the two had blue eyes that seemed unnaturally bright against the cracking , itching mud that plastered him . " We 're going to be killed for this , Marcus , " he said , grinning . In his hand , a sling spun lazily , held taut with the weight of a smooth river pebble . " Your fault , Gaius , for pushing me in . I told you the riverbed was n't dry all the way . " As he spoke , the shorter boy laughed and shoved his friend into the bushes that lined the path . He whooped and ran as Gaius scrambled out and set off in pursuit , sling whirring in a disc . " Battle ! " he shouted in his high , unbroken voice . The beating they would get at home for ruining their tunics was far away , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered was charging through the woodland paths at high speed , scaring birds . Both boys were barefoot , already with calluses developing , despite not having seen more than eight summers . " This time , I 'll catch him , " Gaius panted to himself as he ran . It was a mystery to him how Marcus , who had the same number of legs and arms , could yet somehow make them move faster than he could . In fact , as he was shorter , his stride should have been a little less , surely ? The leaves whipped by him , stinging his bare arms . He could hear Marcus taunting him up ahead , close . Gaius showed his teeth as his lungs began to hurt . Without warning , he broke into a clearing at full pelt and skidded to a sudden , shocked stop . Marcus was lying on the ground , trying to sit up and holding his head in his right hand . Three men -- no , older boys -- were standing there , carrying walking staffs . Gaius groaned as he took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his father 's small estate and into their neighbors ' part of the woods . He should have recognized the track that marked the boundary , but he 'd been too caught up in catching Marcus for once . " What do we have here ? A couple of little mudfish , crawled up out of the river ! " It was Suetonius who spoke , the eldest son of the neighboring estate . He was fourteen and killing time before he went into the army . He had the sort of trained muscles the two younger boys had n't begun to develop . He had a mop of blond hair over a face speckled with white-headed eruptions that covered his cheeks and forehead , with a sprinkling of angry-looking red ones disappearing under his praetexta tunic . He also had a long , straight stick , friends to impress , and an afternoon to while away . Gaius was frightened , knowing he was out of his depth . He and Marcus were trespassing -- the best they could expect was a few blows , the worst was a beating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to stagger to his feet . He 'd obviously been belted with something as he ran into the older boys . " Let us go , Tonius , we 're expected back . " " Speaking mudfish ! We 'll make our fortune , boys ! Grab hold of them , I have a roll of twine for tying up pigs that will do just as well for mudfish . " Gaius did n't consider running , with Marcus unable to get away . This was n't a game -- the cruelty of the boys could be managed if they were treated carefully , talked to like scorpions , ready to strike without warning . The two other boys approached with their staffs held ready . They were both strangers to Gaius . One dragged Marcus to his feet and the other , a hefty , stupid-looking boy , rammed his stick into Gaius 's stomach . He doubled up in agony , unable to speak . He could hear the boy laughing as he cramped and groaned , trying to curl into the pain . " There 's a branch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to swing . We can see who 's the best shot with javelins and stones . " " Your father knows my father , " Gaius spat out as the pain in his stomach lessened . " True -- does n't like him though . My father is a proper patrician , not like yours . Your whole family could be his servants if he wanted . I 'd make that mad mother of yours scrub the tiles . " At least he was talking . The thug with the horsehair twine was intent on tying knots at Gaius 's feet , ready to hoist him into the air . What could he say to bargain ? His father had no real power in the city . His mother 's family had produced a couple of consuls -- that was it . Uncle Marius was a powerful man , so his mother said . " We are nobilitas -- my uncle Marius is not a man to cross . . . " There was a sudden high-pitched yelp as the string over the branch went tight and Marcus was swung into the air upside down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , " Tonius said , laughing gleefully . Gaius noted that the two friends followed his orders without question . It would be pointless trying to appeal to one of them . " Let us down , you spot-covered pus-bag ! " Marcus shouted as his face darkened with the rush of blood . Gaius groaned . Now they would be killed , he was sure . " You idiot , Marcus . Do n't mention his spots ; you can see he must be sensitive about them . " Suetonius raised an eyebrow and his mouth opened in astonishment . The heavyset boy paused in throwing the twine over a second branch . " Oh , you have made a mistake , little fish . Finish stringing that one up , Decius , I 'm going to make him bleed a little . " Suddenly , the world tilted sickeningly and Gaius could hear the twine creak and a low whistle in his ears as his head filled with blood . He rotated slowly and came round to see Marcus in a similar predicament . His nose was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think you 've stopped my nosebleed , Tonius . Thanks . " Marcus 's voice trembled slightly and Gaius smiled at his bravery . When he 'd first come to live with them , the little boy had been naturally nervous and a little small for his age . Gaius had shown him around the estate and they 'd ended up in the hay barn , right at the top of the stacked sheaves . They had looked down at the loose pile far below and Gaius had seen Marcus 's hands tremble . " I 'll go first and show you how it 's done , " Gaius had said cheerfully , launching himself feetfirst and whooping . Below , he 'd looked up at the edge for a few seconds , waiting to see Marcus appear . Just as he 'd thought it would never happen , a small figure shot into the air , leaping high . Gaius had scrambled out of the way as Marcus crashed into the hay , winded and gasping . " I thought you were too scared to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust . " I was , " Marcus had replied quietly , " but I wo n't be afraid . I just wo n't . " The hard voice of Suetonius broke into Gaius 's spinning thoughts : " Gentlemen , meat must be tenderized with mallets . Take your stations and begin the technique , like so . " He swung his stick at Gaius 's head , catching him over the ear . The world went white , then black , and when he next opened his eyes everything was spinning as the string twisted . For a while , he could feel the blows as Suetonius called out , " One-two-three , one-two-three . . . " He thought he could hear Marcus crying and then he passed out to the accompaniment of jeers and laughter . He woke and went back under a couple of times in the daylight , but it was dusk when he was finally able to stay conscious . His right eye was a heavy mass of blood , and his face felt swollen and caked in stickiness . They were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the hills . " Wake up , Marcus -- Marcus ! " His friend did n't stir . He looked terrible , like some sort of demon . The crust of crumbling river mud had been broken away , and there was now only a gray dust , streaked with red and purple . His jaw was swollen , and a lump stood out on his temple . His left hand was fat and had a bluish tinge in the failing light . Gaius tried to move his own hands , held by the twine . Though painfully stiff , they both worked and he set about wriggling them free . His young frame was supple and the burst of fresh pain was ignored in the wave of worry he felt for his friend . He had to be all right , he had to be . First , though , Gaius had to get down . One hand came free and he reached down to the ground , scrabbling in the dust and dead leaves with his fingertips . Nothing . The other hand came free and he widened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow circle . Yes , a small stone with a sharp edge . Now for the difficult part . " Marcus ! Can you hear me ? I 'm going to get us down , do n't you worry . Then I 'm going to kill Suetonius and his fat friends . " Marcus swung gently in silence , his mouth open and slack . Gaius took a deep breath and readied himself for the pain . Under normal circumstances , reaching up to cut through a piece of heavy twine with only a sharp stone would have been difficult , but with his abdomen a mass of bruises , it felt like an impossible task . Go . He heaved himself up , crying out with the pain from his stomach . He jackknifed up to the branch and gripped it with both hands , lungs heaving with the effort . He felt weak and his vision blurred . He thought he would vomit , and could do no more than just hold on for a few moments . Then , inch by inch , he released the hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the twine and saw at it , trying not to catch his skin where it had bitten into the flesh . The stone was depressingly blunt and he could n't hold on for long . Gaius tried to let go before his hands slipped so he could control the fall back , but it was too hard . " Still got the stone , " he muttered to himself . " Try again , before Suetonius comes back . " Another thought struck him . His father could have returned from Rome . He was due back any day now . It was growing dark and he would be worried . Already , he could be out looking for the two boys , coming nearer to this spot , calling their names . He must not find them like this . It would be too humiliating . " Marcus ? We 'll tell everyone we fell . I do n't want my father to know about this . " Marcus creaked round in a circle , oblivious . Five times more , Gaius spasmed up and sawed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat and sobbed as his torn and tortured muscles twitched and jumped . He tried to ease Marcus to the ground , but the weight was too much for him and the thump made him wince . As Marcus landed , he opened his eyes at the fresh pain . " My hand , " he whispered , his voice cracking . " Broken , I 'd say . Do n't move it . We have to get out of here in case Suetonius comes back or my father tries to find us . It 's nearly dark . Can you stand ? " " I can , I think , though my legs feel weak . That Tonius is a bastard , " Marcus muttered . He did not try to open his swollen jaw , but spoke through fat and broken lips . Gaius nodded grimly . " True -- we have a score to settle there , I think . " Marcus smiled and winced at the sting of opening cuts . " Not until we 've healed a bit , though , eh ? I 'm not up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other up , the two boys staggered home in the darkness , walking a mile over the cornfields , past the slave quarters for the field workers and up to the main buildings . As expected , the oil lamps were still lit , lining the walls of the main house . " Tubruk will be waiting for us ; he never sleeps , " Gaius muttered as they passed under the pillars of the outer gate . A voice from the shadows made them both jump . " A good thing too . I would have hated to miss this spectacle . You are lucky your father is not here ; he 'd have taken the skin off your backs for returning to the villa looking like this . What was it this time ? " Tubruk stepped into the yellow light of the lamps and leaned forward . He was a powerfully built ex-gladiator , who 'd bought the position of overseer to the small estate outside Rome and never looked back . Gaius 's father said he was one in a thousand for organizing talent . The slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from liking . He sniffed at the two young boys . " Fall in the river , did we ? Smells like it . " They nodded happily at this explanation . " Mind you , you did n't pick up those stick marks from a river bottom , did you ? Suetonius , was it ? I should have kicked his backside for him years ago , when he was young enough for it to make a difference . Well ? " " No , Tubruk , we had an argument and fought each other . No one else was involved and even if there had been , we would want to handle it ourselves , you see ? " Tubruk grinned at this from such a small boy . He was forty-five years of age , with hair that had gone gray in his thirties . He had been a legionary in Africa in the Third Cyrenaica legion , and had fought nearly a hundred battles as a gladiator , collecting a mass of scars on his body . He put out his great spade of a hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do see , little wolf . You are your father 's son . You can not handle everything yet , though ; you are just a little lad , and Suetonius -- or whoever -- is shaping into a fine young warrior , so I hear . Mind yourselves , his father is too powerful to be an enemy in the Senate . " Gaius drew himself up to his full height and spoke as formally as he knew how , trying to assert his position . " It is luck , then , that this Suetonius is in no way attached to ourselves , " he replied . Tubruk nodded as if he had accepted the point , trying not to grin . Gaius continued more confidently : " Send Lucius to me to look at our wounds . My nose is broken and almost certainly Marcus 's hand is the same . " Tubruk watched them totter into the main house and resumed his post in the darkness , guarding the gate on first watch , as he did each night . It would be full summer soon and the days would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alive with the sky so clear and honest work ahead .
