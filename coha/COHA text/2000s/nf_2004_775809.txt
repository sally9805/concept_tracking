Prologue // Around eight o " clock in the morning on Wednesday , February 8 , 1587 , when // it was light enough to see without candles , Sir Thomas Andrews , sheriff of // the county of Northamptonshire , knocked on a door . The place was // Fotheringhay Castle , about seventy-five miles from London . All that remains // there now beneath the weeds is the raised earthen rampart of the inner bailey // and a truncated mound , or " motte , " on the site of the keep , a few hundred // yards from the village beside a sluggish stretch of the River Nene . // But in the sixteenth century the place was bustling with life . // Fotheringhay was a royal manor . Richard III had been born at the castle in // 1452 . Henry VII , the first of the Tudor kings , who had slain Richard at the // battle of Bosworth , gave the estate as a dowry to his wife , Elizabeth of York , // and Henry VIII granted it to his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle . In 1558 , Elizabeth I inherited the property // when she succeeded to the throne on the death of her elder sister , Mary // Tudor . // Despite its royal associations , nothing had prepared // Fotheringhay , or indeed the British Isles , for what was about to happen there . // Andrews was in attendance on two of England " s highest-ranking noblemen , // George Talbot , Earl of Shrewsbury , and Henry Grey , Earl of Kent . The door // on which he knocked was the entrance to the privy chamber of Mary Queen // of Scots , dowager queen of France and for almost nineteen years Elizabeth " s // prisoner in England . // The door opened to reveal Mary on her knees , praying with her // bedchamber servants . Andrews informed her that the time was at hand , and // she looked up and said she was ready . She rose , and her gentlewomen // stood aside . // She was only forty-four . Born and brought up to be a queen , she // walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing // to a court festival . Almost six feet tall , she had always looked the part . She // had been f ? ted since her childhood in France for her beauty and // allure . " Charmante " and " la plus parfaite " were the adjectives most commonly // applied to her singular blend of celebrity . Not just physically mesmerizing // with her well-proportioned face , neck , arms and waist , she had an unusual // warmth of character with the ability to strike up an instant rapport . Always // high-spirited and vivacious , she could be unreservedly generous and amiable . // She had a razor-sharp wit and was a natural conversationalist . Gregarious as // well as glamorous , she could be genial to the point of informality as long as // her " grandeur " was respected . Many contemporaries remarked on her almost // magical ability to create the impression that the person she was talking to // was the only one whose opinion really mattered to her . // As a result of premature aging caused by the inertia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly complained during her long captivity , // her beauty was on the wane . Her features had thickened and she had // rounded shoulders and a slight stoop . Her face , once legendary for its soft // white skin and immaculate , marble-like complexion , had filled out and // become double-chinned . But captivity did not alter all things . Her small , deep- // set hazel eyes darted as restlessly as ever , and her ringlets of auburn hair // seemed as lustrous . // Mary had been awake for most of the night and had carefully // prepared herself . This was to be her grandest performance , her greatest // triumph ; she had considered every detail . // Her clothes set the tone . She appeared to be dressed entirely in // black apart from a white linen veil . Lace-edged and as delicate as gauze , it // flowed down from her hair over her shoulders to her feet in the French style . // Fastened to the top of the veil was a small white cambric cap . It just touched // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace , leaving room for her // curls to peek out at the sides . Her gown of thick black satin reached almost // to the ground , where it was attached to her train . Trimmed with gold // embroidery and sable , it was peppered with acorn buttons of jet , set with // pearl . // A closer look revealed an outer bodice of crimson velvet and an // underskirt of embroidered black satin , both visible where the gown was // fashionably cut away . To bedeck it , Mary wore long , richly embroidered // slashed sleeves in the Italian style , under which could be seen uncut inner // sleeves of purple velvet . Her shoes were of the finest Spanish suede . Later // someone observed that she wore sky-blue stockings embroidered with silver // thread and held up by green silk garters , these on top of soft white stockings // that she used to protect her skin from chafing . // She carried a crucifix of ivory in one hand and a Latin prayer book // in the other . A string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girdle // at her waist . Around her neck lay a silver or gold chain on which hung a // pendant , a medallion bearing the image of Christ as the Lamb of God . // Led by Andrews and followed by the two earls , Mary walked along // the corridor and into a larger room where her household was waiting to greet // her and bid her farewell . An eyewitness ( perhaps the Earl of Kent himself ) // wrote that she exhorted her servants to fear God and live in obedience . She // kissed her women servants and gave her hand to her menservants to kiss . // She asked them not to grieve for her , but " to rejoice and pray for her . " One of // them afterward reported that she showed no fear and even smiled . // Mary then descended the stairs toward the great hall on the // ground floor . Her legs were so swollen and inflamed by rheumatism , she // leaned for support on the arms of two soldiers . When the procession reached // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her steward , who // knelt and fighting back tears cried out , " Madam , it will be the sorrowfullest // message that I ever carried , when I shall report that my queen and dear // mistress is dead . " // Mary answered , also weeping , " You ought to rejoice rather than // weep for that the end of Mary Stuart " s troubles is now come . " " Carry this // message , " she continued , " and tell my friends that I die a true woman to my // religion , and like a true Scottish woman and a true French woman . " // As Mary recovered her composure , her mood abruptly changed . // She glanced back up the stairs and exclaimed that she was " evil attended . " // She demanded " for womanhood " s sake " that her own servants should escort // her . She harangued the earls , who became fearful that she would cause an // even bigger scene and have to be dragged violently into the great hall . // Shrewsbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . Hearing this , Mary bridled : " Far meaner persons than myself have not // been denied so small a favor . " " Madam , " replied Kent , " it can not well be // granted , for that it is feared lest some of them would with speeches both // trouble and grieve Your Grace and disquiet the company . . . or seek to wipe // their napkins in some of your blood , which were not convenient . " // " My lord , " said Mary , " I will give my word and promise for them // that they shall not do any such thing . " She could not stop herself // adding , " You know that I am cousin to your queen , and descended from the // blood of Henry VII , a married queen of France and the anointed queen of // Scotland . " // The earls huddled together , whispering inaudibly , then gave in to // Mary , who was used to getting her own way . Her two favorite gentlewomen , // Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including // Melville , were allowed to join the procession . " Allons donc , " said Mary , // smiling again  --  " Now let us go . " She spoke in French because this and // Lowland Scots were her native tongues ; English she had learned only with // difficulty in her captivity . // Her retinue now made ready , she strode purposefully into the // great hall with Melville carrying her train . It was self-consciously a royal entry ; // Mary walked before the hundred or so spectators straight toward the focal // point , a wooden stage that had been hastily constructed over the previous // two days beside an open fireplace in which a great pile of logs blazed . She // mounted the two steps that led up to the platform and sat down on a low // stool that was offered to her , after which the earls seated themselves on her // right while the sheriff stood on her left . // There was of course no throne . The stage was a scaffold two feet // high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung low // over the sides to camouflage the rough joinery , with a rail eighteen inches // high around three sides and the unenclosed fourth side in full view of the // spectators in the lower end of the hall . There was a cushion for Mary to kneel // on , this beside an execution block also swathed in black . // Two masked men stood in readiness on the platform , one " Bull , " // the headsman of the Tower of London , and his assistant . They were dressed // in long black gowns with white aprons , their ax laid casually against the rail . // In the lower end of the space , the knights and gentlemen of // Northamptonshire and its neighboring counties looked toward the stage // flanked by a troop of soldiers , their view unrestricted because the platform // had been set at the right height . Outside in the courtyard , beyond the // passageway at the main entrance to the great hall , a large crowd of another // thousand or so waited for news . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clerk of // Elizabeth " s Privy Council and the man responsible for delivering the execution // warrant to Fotheringhay , read it out . As he spoke  --  the warrant would have // taken about ten minutes to read  --  Mary sat completely still . She showed no // emotion , listening , as Robert Wingfield of Upton , Northamptonshire , who was // within ten yards of her , reported , " with as small regard as if it had not // concerned her at all ; and with as cheerful a countenance as if it had been a // pardon . " Her nerve was to be tested , however , when Dr. Richard Fletcher , // Dean of Peterborough , and at this time one of Elizabeth " s favorite preachers , // stepped forward at the Earl of Shrewsbury " s signal . // Fletcher , the father of the dramatist John Fletcher , who was // Shakespeare " s collaborator on Henry VIII , had been brought in to deliver a // setpiece " admonition " to Mary that strictured her for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers . He was one of Elizabeth " s // chaplains in ordinary , renowned for his " comely person " and " courtly speech . " // But his admonition backfired spectacularly ; the attempted // sermon  --  for that is all it was  --  was the greatest faux pas of his career . // When the moment came , he started to stammer nervously . " Madam , " he // began , " the queen " s most excellent majesty " ; " Madam , the queen " s most // excellent majesty . . . " Three times he stumbled , but when he started for the // fourth , Mary cut him off . In a clear and unwavering voice , she said , " Mr. Dean , // I will not hear you . You have nothing to do with me , nor I with you . " // Fletcher , somewhat abashed , countered , " I say nothing but that I // will justify before the majesty of the mighty God . " He was not at first willing to // give way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just , but would // minister to them through his angels . If Mary had been condemned to die , it // was God " s work and the preacher would be called to account for his sermon // only before God . // Hearing this , Mary got into her stride , as she always did in an // argument . " I am settled , " she said , " in the ancient Roman Catholic religion , // and mind to spend my blood in defense of it . " // Fletcher unwisely responded , " Madam , change your opinion and // repent you of your former wickedness , and settle your faith only in Jesus // Christ , by him to be saved . " This was not the way to speak to a queen . Mary , // visibly coloring , ordered him to be silent . There was an awkward pause . Then // the earls gave way . Fletcher was told to omit the sermon , which in a fit of // pique he insisted be transcribed from his notes into a report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even farcical scene ensued . The Earl of Kent urged // Fletcher to begin the prayers , but as the dean started speaking again , Mary // prayed loudly and in Latin with her crucifix before her eyes . // There followed a battle of wills , because as the knights and // gentlemen in the hall joined Fletcher in his versicles and responses , Mary // and her six servants shouted louder and louder until the queen , in tears , // slipped off her stool , at which point she knelt and continued as before . // Even after Fletcher had ceased praying , Mary carried on , in // English now to cause maximum embarrassment . She prayed for the Church , // for an end to religious discord , for her son , the twenty-year-old James VI of // Scotland  --  whom her enemies had brought up as a Protestant  --  that he // might be converted to the true Catholic faith . She prayed that Elizabeth might // prosper and long continue to reign , serving God aright . She confessed that // she hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ at the foot of whose // crucifix she would willingly shed her blood . " She petitioned the saints to pray // for her soul , and that God would in his great mercy and goodness avert his // plagues from " this silly island . " // To the Earl of Kent , himself a staunch Protestant , this was highly // offensive . " Madam , " he said , " settle Christ Jesus in your heart and leave // those trumperies . " But Mary ignored him . Eventually she finished , kissing the // crucifix and making the sign of the cross in the Catholic way . // This was largely contrived . Mary had never truly been the // ideological Catholic that she now wished to appear to the world . She was far // too political for that . As a ruler in Scotland , she had sensibly accepted a // compromise based on the religious status quo and the inroads made by the // Protestant Reformation . Only after her imprisonment in England had she // reinvented herself as a poor Catholic woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great hall at Fotheringhay was for show , and it worked . // By humiliating Fletcher , Mary won a propaganda victory that resounded // around Catholic Europe . // Satisfied , she calmly turned to Bull , who meekly knelt and sought // her forgiveness . She answered , " I forgive you with all my heart , for now , I // hope , you shall make an end of all my troubles . " // The executioners helped Mary " s gentlewomen to undress her // down to her petticoat . As they unbuttoned her , she smiled broadly and joked // that she " never had such grooms before to make her unready " nor did // she " ever put off her clothes before such a company . " // She laid her crucifix and prayer book on her stool , and one of the // executioners took the medallion from around her neck , since custom allowed // that such personal items were a perquisite . But Mary interposed , saying that // she would give these things to her servants and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Mary " s veil and black outer garments were removed , stifled // cries of shock and astonishment reverberated around the hall . Her petticoat // was of tawny velvet , her inner bodice of tawny satin . One of her gentlewomen // handed her a pair of tawny sleeves with which she immediately covered her // arms . A metamorphosis had occurred . // For several minutes Mary stood stock still on the stage , clad in // the color of dried blood : the liturgical color of martyrdom in the Roman // Catholic Church . It was a sight so melodramatic , so abhorrent to the earls , // that they omitted all reference to it from their official report to the Privy // Council . The incident is known only from a contemporary French account // based on the reports of Mary " s attendants , which is confirmed by two // independent English accounts , one by Shrewsbury " s servant , who was // writing to a friend and had no reason to lie . // Mary kissed her gentlewomen , who burst into uncontrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " j " ai promis pour vous . " Or as one of the // English eyewitness accounts renders it , " Peace , peace , cry not , I have // promised the contrary , cry not for me but rejoice . " // She raised her hands and blessed them , and turning to her other // servants , Melville especially , who were weeping aloud and continually // crossing themselves , she prayed in Latin and blessed them too , bade them // farewell , and asked them to remember her in their prayers . // She knelt down " most resolutely " on the cushion while Jane // Kennedy covered her eyes with a white Corpus Christi cloth embroidered in // gold that Mary had chosen the previous night . Jane kissed the cloth , tied it // around Mary " s face in the shape of a triangle and pinned it securely to her // cap . The two gentlewomen then left the platform . // As Mary knelt , she recited in Latin the psalm In te Domino // confido , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trust . " Reaching out for the block , she // laid down her head , positioning her chin carefully with her hands and holding // them there , so that if one of the executioners and cried , " In // manus tuas , Domine , commendo spiritum meum "  --  " Into your hands , O // Lord , I commend my spirit . " She repeated these words three or four times // until , with one executioner holding down her body , the other severed her head . // Except it was the headsman " s turn to blunder . It should have // taken only a single blow , but the strain was too great even for England " s // most experienced executioner . His first strike was misaligned , and the blow // fell on the knot of the blindfold , missing the neck and hacking into the back of // the head . One account says Mary made a " very small noise , " but another // says she cried out in agony , " Lord Jesus receive my soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not completely , and the executioner sliced through the // remaining sinews , using the ax as a cleaver . At length he raised the head , // shouting " God save the queen . " An audible gasp went up from the hall , // because Mary " s lips were still moving as if in prayer , and continued to do so // for a quarter of an hour . // And then the final twist . As the executioner lifted up the head , // Mary " s auburn curls and white cap became detached from her skull . The // illusion of monarchy dissolved as the executioner found himself clutching a // handful of hair while the head fell back to the floor , rolling like a misshapen // football toward the spectators , who saw that it was " very grey and near bald . " // Suddenly everything was clear . The Queen of Scots had worn a // wig . The assembly was struck dumb , until the Earl of Shrewsbury could // stand it no longer and burst into tears . // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // wits . He bellowed , " So perish all the queen " s enemies , " to which the Earl of // Kent , standing over the corpse , echoed , " Such be the end of all the queen " s // and the gospel " s enemies . " But it was a gruesome finale , a harrowing // catharsis . Even in the London theaters , where revenge plays and tragedies // were newly in vogue , no one had seen anything quite like this . // Mary " s distraught servants were led from the scene and locked in // their rooms . The executioners were disrobing the corpse when one of them // saw that her favorite pet dog , a Skye terrier , had hidden itself in the folds of // her petticoat and sneaked onto the stage . When detected , it ran about // wailing miserably and lay down in the widening pool of blood between her // severed head and shoulders . Since it could not be coaxed away , it was // forcibly removed and washed , whereupon it refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed it soon died , but this is not corroborated . // In the afternoon , by order of the earls , the black cotton sheets , the // execution block and cushion , Mary " s clothes and ornaments , and anything // else with blood on it were burned in the open fireplace so that no relics of // the " martyrdom " she had so conspicuously sought to evoke could be // obtained by her Catholic supporters . Still present in the great hall to observe // these cleansing operations were the knights and gentlemen of the county , // and when the earls wrote their official account of the execution , these men // signed their names to the report as solemn witnesses . // The Earl of Shrewsbury " s fourth son , Henry Talbot , was sent // posthaste to London to deliver the report to the Privy Council that same night . // When he had departed , the mortal remains of the dead queen were put on a // stretcher and carried back upstairs to be embalmed . The scaffold was // demolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burying the // heart and inner organs in a secret place within the foundations of the castle , // was sent home . Some of Mary " s ornaments must also have been buried in // the deep recesses of the castle , because the ring she was given at her // betrothal to her second husband , Henry Lord Darnley , was later unearthed in // the ruins and exhibited at Peterborough in 1887. // No one who had witnessed Mary " s last day could ever have // forgotten it . Whatever view is taken of her character , whatever credence is // given to the stories told about her as a way of justifying her forced abdication // and execution , the business on that day was regicide . Mary was an anointed // queen . Elizabeth , her fellow sovereign as much as her rival for the past thirty // years , was herself all too anxious to defend the ideal of monarchy : the // principle that rulers were accountable to God alone . She had done everything // possible to prevent Mary " s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided , and then to shift the blame for it onto the shoulders of others . // Elizabeth had a firm grasp of the issues . She knew that Mary " s // death would alter the way that monarchy was regarded in the British Isles . A // regicide would give a massive boost to Parliament , diminishing forever // the " divinity that hedges a king . " It would help to propagate the theory of // popular sovereignty  --  the belief that political power lies in the people and not // in the ruler  --  and the idea that the representatives of the people were those // they elected to Parliament . This was the ideology invoked by Mary " s rebel // lords in Scotland to depose her . And the same theory would be instilled // there , and more subversively in parts of France , for 250 years after her death , // finally to cross the Atlantic when Dr. William Small , a Scot , taught ethics // and political science to the young Thomas Jefferson at the College of William // and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mary , one so beautiful and // intelligent , so convivial and down-to-earth , so full of life and irresistible , end up // disgraced and deposed ? One of the reasons is that Elizabeth " s chief minister // and leading adviser for forty years , William Cecil , was her antagonist . More // than anyone else , he was her great nemesis . Unlike Elizabeth , Mary was a // Catholic , and Cecil " s overriding ambition was to remold the whole of the // British Isles into a single Protestant community . He had little room for an // independent Scotland , hence his intermittent clashes with his Scottish allies // over the extent of English domination . Whereas Elizabeth did all she could to // protect the ideal of divine-right monarchy irrespective of the religion of its // incumbent , Cecil believed that Parliament had the right to settle the // succession to the throne on religious grounds , meaning that Mary " s dynastic // claim had at all costs to be discounted . // In death as in life , Mary always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an innocent victim . She was mishandled and // traduced : a political pawn in the hands of those perfidious Scottish lords and // ambitious French and English politicians who found her inconvenient and in // their way . To her critics she was fatally flawed . She was far too affected by // her emotions . She ruled from the heart and not the head . She was a femme // fatale , a manipulative siren , who flaunted her sexuality in dancing and // banqueting and did not care who knew it . // Her enemies largely won the argument . Mary has come down to // us not as a shrewd and charismatic young ruler who relished power and , for a // time , managed to hold together a fatally unstable country , but rather as // someone who cared more about her luxuries and pets . She knew how to play // to the gallery . One of the accounts of her execution dismissed her // as " transcending the skills of the most accomplished actress . " But a sense // of theater was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // and there was far more to Mary than so cynical a judgment implies . // This book tries to get to the truth about her , or as close to the // truth as possible : to see her not merely as a bundle of stereotypes or as a // convenient and tenuously linked series of myths , but as a whole woman // whose choices added up and whose decisions made sense . The rationale // relates closely to the method : to write Mary " s life and tell her story using the // original documents rather than relying on the familiar printed collections or // edited abstracts , themselves often compiled to perpetuate rather than to // engage with the legends . It may come as a surprise to learn that such // documents survive in voluminous quantities , preserved in archives and // research libraries as far apart as Edinburgh , Paris , London , the stately // homes of England , and Washington , D.C. , and Los Angeles . Some of them // have not been read by a historian since 1840 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and among these are unrecognized handwritten // transcripts of two of the famous Casket Letters . // The aim is to tell Mary " s story , where possible letting her speak // for herself in her own words , but also to consider why the stories of others // about the very same events are often so strikingly different . Only when this is // done can the myriad of facts be properly sifted , the sequence of events be // explained and understood , and a searchlight cast on a turbulent life . //
