No question , GPS has revolutionized travel  --  navigation aboard airplanes is now virtually child 's play , hikers have no excuse for getting lost , and traveling salespeople can cover more ground faster  --  but do you , Joe Driver , really need satellites beaming coordinates to your dashboard ? For your day-to-day life , probably not . You know where work and home are , and you can get yourself to the mall just fine , thank you very much . But if you visit new places with any regularity , automotive navigation will make even the occasional road trip a lot easier . GPS systems are still relatively expensive , so first ask yourself what you really need . ( Trust me , the excitement of colorful moving maps and chatty female-voiced computers wears off in about a week . ) Expensive units offer more detailed screens , faster route calculations , and extras like voice command , but even the most basic models will tell you precisely where you are and how to get somewhere else . Take a look at the options that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . FOUR WAYS TO FIND YOURSELF 1 Factory-installed These systems are by far the most powerful devices available . Because they are hardwired into your car , they can tap into the speedometer and use electronic gyroscopes to determine where and how fast you 've traveled . That permits continued tracking in dense urban environs , mountains and heavily forested country , where satellite reception might be spotty . Another thing that 's unique to factory systems is that they often provide access to your car 's other functions ( radio , climate controls ) through the same interface . This is particularly useful on an intuitive touchscreen like the one Lexus uses . It 's not as helpful on insanely complicated dial-controls like BMW 's iDrive . ( Audi 's flagship A8 has a far smarter dial control. ) $1,750 to $2,500 option on new-car purchases 2 Aftermarket Many of these units offer functions similar to factory-installed hardware , and a few have distinctive extras  --  Blaupunkt 's TravelPilot DX-V , for example , plays DVDs  --  but expect some visible evidence that they 're aftermarket . Retractable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strapped to the steering wheel take some getting used to , and you may have little antennas and wireless transmitter pods positioned in odd places around the car . Do n't expect these systems to add much to your resale value . $1,250 to $2,000 , plus $150 to $300 for installation 3 Portable If you have more than one vehicle or often find yourself in rental cars , these are a fine compromise . While not as robust as factory units , they are economical  --  gray-scale units start at around $500  --  and offer the same map , routing and voice-command functions as the bigger units . Compact and not permanently attached , they leave the car when you do , or hide in the trunk . While new units from Magellan ( RoadMate 700/500 ) and Garmin ( StreetPilot 2610 ) have nationwide base maps built in , memory limitations on other models require you to upload map data from your PC. $500 to $1,200 4 PDA-based Garmin 's iQue 3600 is the clear leader among the PDA-based units , with a built-in GPS antenna and an exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with a simple but reliable bean-bag mount to stabilize it on the dashboard . Other PDA-based units require antenna attachments and come with a confusing array of cables and adapters to attach the unit to your dashboard , usually by inserting plastic tabs into air vents . And note that PDA units are by far the hardest to operate while driving , especially when a stylus is involved . $200 to $500 DEPT : Geek Guide INVESTIGATOR : Eric Adams TECH : Automotive GPS COST : $200-$2,500 Beta Final 4 Buying Advice  --  Do n't waste time looking for differences in the map information  --  all automotive GPS manufacturers get data from the same two companies , NavTech and Tele Atlas .  --  The GPS tech itself also varies little among manufacturers . One unit might track a few more of the 20 orbiting GPS satellites than another , but in everyday use these differences are nominal .  --  More important are factors such as how good the maps look , how intuitive the interface is , how quickly it calculates routes , and how easy and expensive it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via a DVD , others use CDs with regional data , and portable units typically rely on data downloaded from the Web . Costs range from $30 to $100 for a new version or region. )  --  Avoid any device without automatic route recalculation , which constantly updates your route based on where you are right now  --  useful if you stop along the way , or miss your exit while fiddling with the iDrive . Using Your System  --  Heed the warning screens  --  do n't tinker with these things while driving . Do your programming while at a standstill , or let your passenger do it .  --  Likewise , do n't become hypnotized by the moving maps . We know the little arrow is cute  --  that 's you !  --  but it wo n't keep you from roaring into the back of a slow-moving minivan.  --  Specify all the functions you want enabled or disabled . Enroute from Washington , D.C. , to New York , my test Lexus RX330 kept demanding that I take the next exit and head west to the Pennsylvania Turnpike  --  something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? Why ! ? ! ? " I screamed at the female voice emanating from my dashboard . The answer : I had told the unit to avoid toll roads .  --  Do n't fret if your display shows you jumping between the north- and southbound lanes  --  most units are programmed to snap to the nearest road . Generally , GPS will place you within 50 feet of your actual location though newer units use WAAS  --  a combination of satellites and ground stations  --  to nail it to within 10 feet .  --  The little point-of-interest symbols that show up on the screen can tell you something about a community you 're driving through . Swanky Old Town Alexandria in northern Virginia , for example , was all knife-and-fork icons ( restaurants ) . In a blue-collar burb in northern Baltimore : little wrenches ( mechanics ) . You can cut this social profiling  --  and declutter the screen substantially  --  by activating this function only when you really need a bite , a museum or a state park .
