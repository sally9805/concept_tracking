<p> OVERTON , Nev.  --  Hard-timers park rickety trailers and campers on federal hills outside town and squat there without electricity , water or bathrooms until cops scatter them , then return once the feds are n't looking . <p> The left-outs ' hardscrabble game on barren ground makes this spot feel like the middle of nowhere important . Fitting , then , as a spot to take the wheel of Nissan 's 2001 Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle . <p> Pathfinder has been around since , roughly , the creation of sand , but it has been eclipsed by big-money rivals that put more power under their hoods , jazzed up their interiors and generally added features while cash-strapped Nissan soldiered on with minor updates . Result : Pathfinder 's in the automotive equivalent of the middle of nowhere important . <p> Pathfinder sales last year were down 3% from 1998 , while the exploding SUV market was up 15.2% , and the midsize segment in which Pathfinder competes was up 10.4% . <p> Not only that . Pathfinder 's average transaction price  --  what a buyer pays after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similarly equipped version of archrival Toyota 4Runner , says Gary Van Houten , Nissan 's U.S. SUV marketing boss . <p> Nissan has lacked cash for a needed overhaul , only getting a glimpse of a bright future last year when French maker Renault bought control of the ailing Japanese automaker and sent no-nonsense executive Carlos Ghosn to run the place . <p> Still , Nissan managed to slick up the Pathfinder 's styling last year . This year 's updated interior and dramatically improved engine and transmission finish the freshening . <p> The whole makeover did n't happen at once , because Nissan could n't get the new powertrain ready in time to offer it along with the revised styling . <p> But now it 's all a package , and the result is a much-improved truck . <p> The V-6 engine is the main story . Displacement increases to 3.5 liters from 3.3 . The engine is made from lightweight aluminum , vs. the previous model 's cast iron . <p> Horsepower is 240 on automatic-transmission models , up a whopping 70 hp . Manual-shift models , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 80 hp . The 3.5 gets the same fuel economy as the 3.3 did  --  15 to 17 miles per gallon in town , 18 or 19 mpg on the highway , depending on equipment . <p> But the new engine needs premium fuel ; the old one runs on less-expensive regular . <p> The automatic transmission is almost as big an upgrade as the engine . It is so massively redone , it should be considered a new gearbox , says Junki Ando , senior Nissan engineer in charge of the Pathfinder 's powertrain . <p> The four-wheel-drive system remains a weak point . It 's part time only . You have to shift into 4x4 mode when traction 's lousy , then back to 4x2 on dry , hard surfaces to avoid wrecking the mechanism and tearing up the tires . An automatic , full-time system like the one in the mechanically similar Infiniti QX4 is n't planned for Pathfinder until November . <p> Nissan plans little or no price increase when the ' 01 goes on sale late this month or next . <p> The changes mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed hill climbing . The extra power of the 3.5-liter engine is apparent in every situation at any speed . The engine 's even quieter than the coarse-sounding 3.3 . Bravo . <p> * Gearshifts that rival , perhaps surpass , those of the best luxury-car transmissions . The transmission hardware was beefed up to handle the bigger engine 's additional power without shredding the gears and blowing the fluid . And the computer program that tailors the shifts was connected to the engine computer for better synchronization . Upshifts on the test drive were impeccable , almost unnoticeable . Downshifts in all but a few situations were instant , crisp , smooth . <p> The torque converter , a main component that spins the transmission fluid forcefully enough to turn gears and drive the vehicle , was made more efficient . That helps maintain the same fuel-economy rating . Ando says the ' 01 got slightly better mileage than the previous model in tests , but not enough to round up to the next mile per gallon on the window sticker . <p> * A comfortable , attractive interior that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-day test drive of several versions . The leather chairs were especially comfy . Gauges are white with gray markings , more distinguished-looking than the dark dials of yore . <p> The rear seat reclines for additional comfort and provides enough room for two grown-ups . The radio , unfortunately , remains lower and less accessible than the climate control . Industry studies show that people use the radio more often , suggesting it should be top center . The ashtray is tiny but well-placed in the console . <p> * Styling that helps but does n't quite get the job done . The tailgate still sports mysterious indentations inboard of the fender-mounted taillights . It 's as if the lights were supposed to continue onto the gate , but Nissan ran out of money for bigger lights or something . <p> The front , where most of the styling changes were made last year , still has a slight fat-lip look . <p> The tweaks and modifications make the ' 01 Pathfinder a quick , satisfying , smooth-riding road machine without apparent sacrifice in off-road capabilities . <p> In about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By then Nissan expects to have a full-size SUV , probably based on the full-size pickup under development for ' 02 or ' 03 . It is n't clear whether that big SUV is intended as Pathfinder 's replacement or its stablemate . <p> Meanwhile , Nissan intends to aggressively market the re-jiggered ' 01 Pathfinder against the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Toyota 's 4Runner , hoping that improving the product while holding the line on price will eliminate the need for big discounts . <p> Objectively , the comparisons make sense . <p> Pathfinder 's V-6 has more horsepower and torque than 4Runner 's V-6  --  more horsepower even than Grand Cherokee 's V-8 , though less torque . <p> Exterior dimensions of the three SUVs are within an inch of one another . <p> Pathfinder has 85 cubic feet of cargo space with the back seat folded , about 7% more than 4Runner , nearly 18% more than Grand Cherokee . But Pathfinder loses when the back seat 's up : just 38 cubic feet behind the seat , vs. 44.6 in 4Runner , 39 in Grand Cherokee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'd be hard to find a truck shopper who 'd say that the Nissan name is worth as much in image and dollars as Jeep or Toyota . <p> Still , the test drive made it clear that the ' 01 Pathfinder is smooth , powerful and comfortable enough to match or beat its targeted rivals . If Nissan can come up with a marketing scheme that gives Pathfinder a fair hearing , the truck will hold up its end of the bargain . <p> &lt;&gt; ' 01 Nissan Pathfinder&lt;&gt; <p> * What is it ? Midsize , four-door sport-utility vehicle , available with two- or four-wheel drive , marketed as a premium alternative to Nissan 's similar-size , lower-price , youth-oriented Xterra SUV . <p> * What 's standard ? 3.5-liter V-6 engine rated 240 horsepower and 265 foot-pounds of torque with automatic transmission , 250 hp and 240 ft. - lbs. with manual transmission ; air conditioning ; power steering , brakes , windows , mirrors , locks ; anti-lock brakes ; remote-control locks ; cruise control ; AM/FM/CD/cassette stereo ; tilt-adjustable steering column ; rear-window wiper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy glass ; front tow hooks ; fuel-tank skid plate ; roof rack ; full-size spare tire mounted underneath . <p> * How much ? Prices are n't set . Nissan is shooting for no change from the current range of about $ 27,000 for the base , two-wheel-drive ( 4x2 ) XE to about $ 35,000 for a loaded , four-wheel-drive ( 4x4 ) LE . <p> * How soon ? On sale late this month or early next . <p> * How big ? Within an inch of rivals Toyota 4Runner and Jeep Grand Cherokee on the outside , Pathfinder is 182.7 inches long ( 190.7 with optional tailgate tire carrier ) , 69.7 inches wide ( 71.7 inches with optional fender flares ) , 70.9 inches tall , on a 106.3-inch wheelbase . Pathfinder is rated to tow 3,500 pounds with manual transmission , 5,000 pounds with automatic . <p> * Overall : Much nicer than ever , but it 's probably worth waiting for the full-time four-wheel-drive system in November .
