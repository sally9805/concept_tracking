Section : TRIAL TACTICS The Rev. Henry Lyons ' racketeering trial this month will test how the race and religion cards play to juries <p> Part Mick Jagger , part James Brown  --  and all preacher  --  the Rev. Henry J. Lyons may be the hardest working man in the religion business . And perhaps one of the most uncompromising . " You 're either going to heaven , or you 're going to hell , " an electrified Lyons told the congregation one Sunday in early October at his Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church in St. Petersburg , Fla . <p> But those who walk the straight and narrow can stray . " Even with God as your father , you stumble sometimes , " Lyons reminded his inspired congregation . <p> That remark probably would draw at least a private " amen " from state and federal prosecutors . They say that Lyons , one of the nation 's most visible black religious leaders , has stumbled mightily and that his sins are many . <p> Lyons , who also is president of National Baptist Convention USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state charges that he used the organization as a vehicle for racketeering in a series of schemes to steal millions from three corporations and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith . Lyons also faces a federal trial in April on 54 counts of conspiracy , fraud , extortion , money laundering , tax evasion and making false statements to banks and government agencies . <p> " It certainly has n't set well with the church here and the National Baptist Convention , " admits Lyons , who turns 57 on Jan. 17 . " I thought racketeering was for something like gangsters . I did n't think that term would be applied to me or any other preacher . " <p> The defense table in a criminal courtroom may be unfamiliar ground for a pastor accustomed to taking command from the pulpit . But public protestations about his predicament from Lyons and others have a familiar  --  some say tired  --  ring . <p> Lyons and his supporters have claimed at various times that he 's being hounded because of race and religion , a tactic that may make for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The evidence shows Lyons spent hundreds of thousands of dollars from a church bank ' account on a luxury home , fancy cars and jewelry . Yet his lawyers say they plan to argue that his conduct is acceptable in the black religious community . Thus , defense lawyers say , because Lyons ' church did n't punish him , the government should n't either . <p> " It 's going to be difficult , " acknowledges lead defense lawyer Denis M. de Vlaming of Clearwater , Fla. , who likely will face an all-white jury . <p> Even before he was first charged in state court last February , Lyons already had complained loudly that he was being persecuted by the white-owned news media . He still maintains that media pressure forced law enforcement to move against him . <p> " You ca n't attack the last vestige of black self-esteem that there is , and that 's the black church , " says defense lawyer and Bethel Metropolitan member Grady C. Irvin Jr . of St. Petersburg . " No one knows how much the pope is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets into their finances . No one knows how much Billy Graham makes . I 'd like to know what Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell is worth . Why is Rev. Lyons being singled out ? It gives the appearance that black pastors are supposed to be paupers . " <p> Lawyers experienced in cases spotlighting fiery issues say Lyons ' double-barreled racial and religious defense could backfire . <p> " You have to realize when you do that , you can wade into an area that can blow up in your face , " says Charles W. Gittins of Alexandria , Va. , who defended former Army Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney early last year on charges of sexual misconduct involving six white female soldiers . House-of-Cards Defense <p> Moreover , some lawyers say , litigants who overplay race , religion and other tender subjects , particularly in highly publicized cases , risk trivializing the issues and jading potential jurors into ignoring such subjects even when they are legitimately raised . <p> " There 's a dignity and honor to the law , and it rises above biases and prejudices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deno G. Economou of Bradenton , Fla. , who prosecuted a Christian Scientist couple charged with abusing and murdering their 9-year-old diabetic daughter by failing to seek medical care for religious reasons . " If you allow yourself to be swept up by bias , prejudice or whatever , then you 've lost . " <p> Although Lyons has since toned down his rhetoric , the specter of race and religion hung over the approaching trial as his supporters continued to publicly push the two hot buttons into the fall . <p> " The white establishment 's target today is Rev. Lyons , " declared a newspaper that his supporters , including his daughter Vonda , distributed at the Baptist convention 's September meeting in Kansas City , Mo . " Their target tomorrow , who knows ? Black America , however , is the ultimate victim . " <p> On the religious front , lawyers for Lyons failed in an attempt last summer to dismiss the state case by arguing that the charges infringed on Lyons ' First Amendment right to solicit money and conduct church business without government interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan F. Schaeffer let the charges stand , she invited defense lawyers to revisit the religious issue later in the case . <p> Despite public gripes that the media and prosecutors are racially motivated , defense lawyers say they expect to play the race and religion cards more subtly than Lyons ' supporters have done outside court . They hope to use expert testimony to show that black churches and their leaders hold a much more dominant position in their communities than do white churches and clergy . With that comes church members ' nearly blind deference to their leaders ' financial decisions . So it does n't matter what Lyons did with the money he says he legitimately collected for the church , de Vlaming says . <p> " When it comes to the reverend of the church , that 's where the buck stops , " says de Vlaming , who is white . " It 's not questioned . I think an awful lot of this needs to be discussed . " <p> To boot , none of the alleged victims has ever complained to authorities , de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they investigated a July 1997 fire his wife , Deborah , set to a $700,000 waterfront home he bought with another woman . <p> Lyons has headed the Nashville-based convention since 1994 . He claims it 's the nation 's largest black denomination with 8.5 million members in 33,000 churches , although prosecutors suggest the actual membership may be less than 1 million . Among his friends , Lyons counts President Clinton and well-known civil rights leaders . <p> Lyons became ensnared in the criminal investigation after his wife learned he had bought a home in a plush St. Petersburg community with Bernice Edwards , 41 , a convicted embezzler from Milwaukee with a half-dozen Social Security numbers and a string of aliases . He had hired Edwards as the convention 's public relations director in 1994 . Drinking and distraught because she believed her husband was having an affair with Edwards , Deborah Lyons , 51 , set several small fires in the home , causing an estimated $30,000 damage . She pleaded guilty to arson and was placed on five years ' probation . <p> The bottom fell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutors accused him of , among other things , spending for himself nearly $244,000 the Anti-Defamation League had donated to rebuild burned black churches ; and of using inflated church membership figures , phony membership lists and extortion to steal from companies wanting to market credit cards , life insurance and prepaid cemetery plots to black consumers . In all , prosecutors say Lyons funneled nearly $5 million from the swindle into a secret convention bank account he controlled with Edwards , who also was charged in the state case . <p> The federal charges lodged in July in Tampa allege more of the same and still more corporate victims , as well as six banks , the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and even the Nigerian military government of Gen. Sani Abacha . Also charged in the federal case were Edwards and Baptist convention meeting planner Brenda Harris ; whom prosecutors describe as Lyons ' girlfriend . <p> Among the eye-popping luxuries prosecutors say Lyons and the other defendants bought with the money were the burned house , a diamond ring the size of a small acorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lake Tahoe time-share . <p> Almost from the start of the investigation , Lyons focused his ire at the St. Petersburg Times , a Pulitzer Prize-winning paper with a staunchly liberal reputation , which published scores of stories detailing his finances and personal life . <p> " This character assassination is all about race , " Lyons said in an August 1997 interview with the Florida Sentinel Bulletin , a biweekly newspaper serving black readers in the Tampa Bay area . Lyons later apologized for his comments , but his supporters kept up the racial and religious drumbeat . <p> Lyons ' cry of racism did n't resound well in either the black or mainstream press . Times columnist Bill Maxwell says the newspaper took pains to make sure black reporters and editors were involved in the Lyons stories every step of the way . Maxwell says Lyons should have known better than to attack the Times as racist . <p> " It 's really the most cynical thing a black minister could do , " says Maxwell , who has known Lyons about 15 years . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our columnists , Elijah Gosier , has written scathing columns about Rev. Lyons , and he 's black . I 'm black , and I wrote about Rev. Lyons . " <p> Indeed , investigative files depict Lyons as a public relations wizard , adept at using race and religion to his own advantage . <p> The Anti-Defamation League 's executive committee chairman , Howard Berkowitz , recalls the decision to allow Lyons to distribute the organization 's contribution to the burned churches . Berkowitz and other ADL officials had met Lyons in 1995 aboard Air Force One as they returned home from the funeral of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . <p> " I found Rev. Lyons , referred to by the Wall Street Journal as a ' classy cleric , ' to be a man of courage , a man of conscience and a man of independent thought who works around the clock for the best interests of his people and of all Americans , " Berkowitz said at a November 1996 dinner where Lyons was presented with a $225,000 check . <p> In all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , AVL officials learned almost none of the money had gone to black churches and demanded an accounting . They became outraged and insisted the money be returned after lawyer Irvin described in a September 1997 letter the ADL 'S contribution to the Baptist convention as " de minimis " compared with millions of dollars in corporate donations other church organizations had received . Irvin later returned $214,500 of the money with a check drawn on his trust account . Business with the ' Black Pope ' <p> Also impressed with Lyons was Loewen Group International , a British Columbia-based cemetery products company , which Baptist convention pastors were supposed to endorse as the " death care provider of choice " as part of a 1995 marketing deal the company made with Lyons . <p> Larry Miller , Loewen vice president , described Lyons as the " black pope , " even after prosecutors said Lyons and Edwards tried to extort $2 million from the company with a bogus promise to help it handle a Mississippi lawsuit . <p> In putting the squeeze on Loewen , Lyons and Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they had dissuaded the Congressional Black Caucus from investigating Loewen for " ripping off poor people . " Moreover , Miller told investigators , if Lyons did n't get the money he threatened to call a news conference on the Capitol steps denouncing Loewen and quitting the marketing agreement . " What I think of Loewen depends on whether I get my money , " Miller quoted Lyons as saying . <p> The company eventually forked over $3.1 million to Lyons , including $100,000 to a drug rehabilitation program in exchange for a promised meeting between Chairman Ray Loewen and President Clinton . Although Loewen executives were convinced Lyons was blackmailing them , they kept paying because they " believed that Lyons was a man of great influence , and that he was capable of making the marketing agreement a great success , " according to the investigation report . The Clinton meeting never occurred . <p> Another corporation wanting to cash in on convention members was Globe Life and Accident Insurance Co. of Oklahoma City , which wanted to buy a church membership list for a direct-mail sales campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , under which it would pay $50 per 1,000 names . <p> Lyons furnished 7.7 million names , but problems became obvious from the start when one person who got Globe 's initial mailing was an imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan . Nevertheless , after narrowing down the list to about 3.3 million names and spending $4.3 million on the project , including $1.1 million to Lyons , the company sold nearly 5,500 policies worth an estimated $1.1 million in annual premiums . <p> Company officials told investigators that it was too early to determine whether the list ultimately would be a money-maker , and that the word " ' defrauded ' is too strong " to describe their dealings with Lyons . Defense lawyers say executives acknowledged in depositions that Globe considered Lyons ' endorsement more valuable than Michael Jordan 's . <p> " No one made a complaint , " de Vlaming says . " He did n't cheat anybody . These corporations solicited him . They got what they paid for . " Different Crowd in Court <p> Lyons skillfully peddled race and religion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in a county where only 6.3 percent of the jury pool is black . Because Florida uses six-member juries , Lyons will be lucky to get one black on his panel , though his chances are better in federal court , which uses 12 jurors drawn from a larger area . <p> Regardless of stacked demographics , lawyers seasoned in high-profile cases with potent racial and religious overtones say those weapons can easily be turned against a litigant who carelessly wields them . <p> Alexandria lawyer Gittins , for one , faced a tough choice when he represented McKinney , the Army 's highest-ranking enlisted man and the first black to hold the post . Gittins had strongly suspected racial bias in the investigation and prosecution of his client , and had publicly expressed that concern . <p> However , some of his evidence on racial motivation did n't pan out , and the court ruled irrelevant other evidence on race . That left Gittins with two black female soldiers who would testify that investigators had asked them whether McKinney preferred white women . That was n't enough , Gittins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence and his spotless 29-year service record . <p> The eight-member court-martial jury also included only one black , with six votes required for a verdict . That further tilted the odds against the success of any race-based defense , Gittins says . <p> " We had almost an all-white jury . I do n't think an all-white jury would be sympathetic to that unless we had overwhelming evidence . " <p> McKinney , who faced up to 55 years in prison , was acquitted in March of all the sex charges but convicted on one comparatively minor count of obstructing justice . He was demoted one rank and allowed to retire with full pay . <p> Sometimes the law has built-in defenses for religions . In the late 1980s , more than 40 states had on the books purported exemptions from child-abuse charges for parents who refused medical help for their ill children for religious reasons . <p> Those exemptions formed the cornerstone of the defenses in two trials of Christian Scientist couples in 1989 and 1990 . William an , Christine Hermanson of Sarasota , Fla. , and David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to die instead of seeking medical care . Christian Scientists rely primarily on prayer for healing . <p> The exemptions left Florida prosecutor Economou and Boston prosecutor John A. Kiernan with the delicate task of getting jurors to keep their eyes on the ball without appearing insensitive to religion . <p> Kiernan faced a particularly tricky situation in the Twitchells ' 1990 trial in Boston , where the Christian Science faith is headquartered . The church had taken out full-page newspaper ads before the trial , attacking the prosecution as an assault on religious freedom . <p> " That was a real attempt to taint the jury pool , " Kiernan recalls . " When you have that much media attention , you have to stay focused . " <p> That meant he had to keep the jury 's attention on 2 1/2-year-old Robyn , who died of a bowel obstruction . <p> " There was a great deal of talk about religion , but we kept the focus on the child , " Kiernan says . Just as important , he says , was avoiding the appearance of attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " We tried to take a scalpel and say belief falls on one side of the line , and practice falls on the other side . Beliefs are protected . Practice is not . " <p> Although jurors convicted the Twitchells in Robyn 's death and the Hermansons in the death of their daughter , Amy , the Massachusetts and Florida supreme courts overturned the verdicts on issues other than religion . Nevertheless , the prosecutors say these cases show that juries will see right through a bogus racial or religious argument , no matter who makes it . " When you 're dishonest with jurors , you 'll always lose , " Economou says . " They 'll punish you . " When Enough Is Enough <p> Jurors in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , did n't wait until the verdict to punish lawyers for the flamboyant Rev. Al Sharpton and two associates . Instead , they told the lawyers in the middle of Sharpton 's defamation trial that they were fed up with personal racial attacks on a witness . <p> Former prosecutor Steven A. Pagones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was part of a group of white men who raped 15-year-old Tawana Brawley in 1987 . Brawley 's stow turned out to be a hoax , and Pagones was cleared . <p> The defamation trial took a nasty turn last February during the cross-examination of a plaintiffs witness who was white and who the black defendants accused of being racist . The six jurors , including two blacks , put their collective foot down in an extraordinary move . <p> " The jury sent a note to the judge and said this has to stop . We 're here to decide the case on the facts , not on race , " remembers Pagones ' lawyer , William E. Stanton of Millbrook , N.Y . <p> Justice S. Barrett Hickman called the lawyers into his chambers and read the note . He did n't have to say anything else to the defendants . <p> " You could see their faces when that note was read , " Stanton says . " They were shocked . I think they thought they were scoring points . " <p> The defendants stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the case was about their right to speak out as civil rights leaders . Stanton did not object . Although Pagones had sought $395 million in damages , the jury awarded $345,000 , and only $65,000 against Sharpton . Sharpton 's lawyer , Michael A. Hardy of New York City , says the reduced award shows the broader racial defense was effective . <p> " As with any trial tactic , I think you have to develop a theory that fits the law and the facts , " Hardy says . " The motivation for pursuing this case was Mr. Sharpton 's status as a black civil rights leader . In that situation , it 's perfectly appropriate to use the race card . But a frivolous defense will be viewed frivolously by a jury , unless it has a clear and righteous connection to the facts . " <p> A Florida jury soon will have to decide whether Lyons ' proposed defense fits the facts . So far , Lyons has hung on with his local church and the National Baptist Convention . <p> In September 1997 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his handling of convention money and giving him a vote of confidence . After the government froze Lyons ' assets last July , at least four Bethel Metropolitan members pledged their homes so he could make the $125,000 bail on the federal charges . <p> Supporters collected buckets full of cash and checks for his defense at the September meeting in Kansas City , despite reports that Lyons ' deals had hurt the convention financially . He also received a second vote of confidence from the 200-member board after he admitted an affair with co-defendant Harris . He plans to run for a second five-year term as president when his current term expires this fall . <p> In short , Lyons says , the convention does n't consider itself a victim . That should be enough for the jury , adds lawyer de Vlaming . " If the Baptist convention did n't get rid of him , then a jury should not decide to do it . " <p> That may carry a little water in state court , where some of the alleged victims appear reluctant to pin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to federal court , where the charges include tax evasion and lying to the government . There , at least one alleged victim , the United States , probably wo n't be so timid . <p> The federal case also may have caused Lyons to look in the mirror and temper his own initially vehement accusations of racism . The investigation was launched and the indictments were obtained by the Tampa office of U.S. Attorney Charles R. Wilson , who is black . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : PRAYING FOR DELIVERANCE : The National Baptists Convention has no grievance witht the way Lyons handled its money , but state and federal prosecutors do . <p> GRADY IRVIN : Targeting Lyons " gives the apperance that black pastors are supposed to be paupers .
