When Prozac arrived in the U.S. in 1987 , with its catchy , computer-generated name and massive marketing campaign , it did n't just take over the market for antidepressants ; it expanded that market many times over , quickly becoming one of the world 's best-selling drugs . Although originally approved only for adults with " symptoms of depressive illness , " Prozac and its imitators ( Zoloft , Paxil , Celexa , Luvox ) are taken today by millions of patients  --  including more and more children  --  who do n't necessarily meet the textbook criteria for clinical depression . Veterinarians have even made Prozac their No. 1 choice for dogs with the blues . <P> Prozac and the other so-called SSRIs have been a breakthrough on several levels . Compared with first-generation antidepressants , they are remarkably effective and relatively free of serious side effects . They work by slowing the brain 's absorption of the mood-enhancing neurotransmitter serotonin ( thus the term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . <P> What makes serotonin such an important brain chemical is that it affects everybody , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prozac on the Couch , if you were to go on the drug today , there 's a good chance that you would feel better , even if you are n't depressed . Dr. Peter Kramer , author of Listening to Prozac , describes the effect as feeling " better than well . " <P> And that raises an intriguing question about the future of mood-altering pharmaceuticals : If Prozac can make you feel better even if you are not depressed , why should n't we all be taking it ? Is that the direction we 're going , as the drugs become more socially acceptable and heavily marketed ? ( More than 11 million Americans already take some form of antidepressant . ) It 's a question that arises only because SSRIs are relatively mild and subtle medications . There are plenty of drugs that can make you feel better , at least temporarily  --  alcohol and heroin come immediately to mind  --  but they tend to be addictive or toxic or both . Prozac is neither . <P> The drug does have its risks . According to several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nausea , weakness , loss of appetite and tremors . For up to 60% of users , Prozac will interfere with their sex drive . Given indiscriminately to manic-depressives , it can trigger serious manic episodes . And there is anecdotal evidence linking Prozac with suicide and other violent behavior , although whether Prozac or the underlying depression is to blame is still an open question . <P> But what if antidepressants like Prozac were one day made completely free of side effects and served only to elevate mood ? Would there be an objection to prescribing them for the entire nation ? Every psychiatrist I spoke with still answered " probably . " Some see SSRIs as a kind of mental shortcut that relieves patients of the need to work through their problems . Others fear that a nation on Prozac would miss the inherent value of struggle and strife . Dr. Kramer thinks there may be an intrinsic virtue in what he calls the " unmodified personality . " Although this month the FDA approved Prozac for treating children and adolescents ages 7 to 14 , Dr. Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bemoans its use for kids , fearing that it may interfere with their emotional development .
