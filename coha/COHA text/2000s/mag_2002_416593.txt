They then travel up the back of your throat to your nose , " says Alan Hirsch , M.D. , author of Scentsational Sex . " Once there , the pheromones boost your arousal , turning you on and causing your body to send off scents and signals that make you more desirable to women " Try it next time you 're in a bar .

Mother Nature 's original blue potency capsule may do even more for you . " Blueberries are one of the best foods for older men with erectile problems , " says Mary Ellen Camire , Ph.D. , a professor of food science at the University of Maine . " They 're loaded with soluble fiber , which helps push excess cholesterol through your digestive system before it can be broken down , absorbed , and deposited along the walls of your arteries " she says .
