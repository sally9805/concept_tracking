Discover Redding , California 's new bridge and waterfront parks Photograph Stroll across the softly illuminated glass deck of Reading 's new Sundial Bridge at dusk . // PHOTOGRAPHS BY CATHERINE KARNOW To stand on the glass deck of the new Sundial Bridge in Redding , California , is to feel suspended between heaven and earth . With the salmon-filled Sacramento River rushing beneath your feet and the bridge 's gleaming white mast spiking more than 200 feet skyward , you could almost be floating on the mellow , cottonwood-scented evening breeze . Soaring , yet intimate-the $23.5 million span that opened on the Fourth of july is for people , not cars-the Sundial is destined to become California 's second-most-recognized bridge . But the 710-foot suspension bridge is more than an audacious architectural statement : It 's the final turn in Redding 's slow reorientation toward the Sacramento River . It was n't all that long ago that the river was seen as barely accessible-a resource valued mostly for electrical generation , irrigation , and gravel production . Now it 's the centerpiece of a 20-mile riverside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next May , an arboretum and botanical garden . People are birding , hiking , and cycling here , and anglers are pulling huge rainbow trout out of the river 's restored fishery . The new Sundial Bridge brings it all together , and September is a great month to take in all that the river has to offer . More than just a bridge In spite of a globe-spanning resume that included some three dozen bridges among projects in 17 countries , Santiago Calatrava had never built a bridge in the U.S. Part architect , part engineer , and part artist , the 54-year-old Spaniard turned out to be the perfect designer . Photograph Spanning the broad Sacramento River without touching it , the bridge links riverside museums and pathways. // The engineering challenges were daunting . The bridge would have to span critical salmon spawning grounds without putting any footings in the river below . Calatrava 's solution : Build a single pylon tall enough to cantilever a full 80 percent of the bridge from the north bank of the river . Nonskid glass decking lets cloud-soft light fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harp rocked back on its frame , the bridge and its spire had an unexpected surprise for its designer . " After environmental assessments showed the ideal place for construction , we saw that the bridge would run exactly north-south , " Calatrava says . " This relates the bridge to the cosmos , just as a sundial does . When the shadow cast by the mast passes over the plaza on the north side of the river , it marks off the hours . " Riverfront parks and trails Begin a visit to the Turtle Bay Exploration Park on the south side of the river at the visitor center . The first thing you notice is the Monolith , an interpretive sculpture created by artist Buster Simpson from the ruins of the site 's original gravel plant . Catwalks take visitors through the area , where art teaches about industry . Next , walk through Paul Bunyan 's Forest Camp , with its logging and ecology exhibits . The main museum combines art , cultural history , and natural history in its exhibits . A 22,000gallon aquarium , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 of the river 's 58 kinds of fish , including white sturgeon and rainbow trout . Hikers , bikers , and in-line skaters can explore the river 's banks via the Sacramento River Trail . A good 10-mile loop from the north bank of the bridge passes through increasingly wild country , where lizards and snakes skitter out of the way , and mountain lions make an occasional appearance . The day ends where it started : at the Sundial Bridge . As you stand on the glass deck , the importance of the span is clear . Santiago Calatrava did n't simply give Redding a bridge-he gave the city its river . // Weekend in Redding Redding is 220 miles-about 3 hours-north of San Francisco .
