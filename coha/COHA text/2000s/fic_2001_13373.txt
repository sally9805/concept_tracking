Late night  --  3 am , May 25th 1998 , a bare cell in a Prison . Prisoner Manima kneels by his bedside , a six-spring bed , with a cheap blanket covering an age-worn mattress , of rubber foam of negligible thickness . The pillow used to be white . But now , the colour is between shades of brown , black and gray . His prison uniform feels a bit tight on his middle side , which wears a characteristic bulge . The Prisoner looks up from the bible , stares vacantly to the pock-marked ceiling , and sighs as he slowly rises to his feet , with bible in hand . MANIMA ( Shaking the Bible with one hand , and pointing a finger to the ceiling ) . What is this animal called man ? Man kills for pleasure ; Animal kills out of necessity to feed on , To defend self from being food to other animals . ( He paces round the little cell , a taut bow , on edge and visibly frustrated ) . Man thinks , Animal thinks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man speaks human language , Animal speaks animal language . ( As if he found the answer , slowly walks back to the bed and sits on it . His head pensively bowed , resting between his hands . ) Shame on you ! You seek to jail me and make me a non-person . You think you have temporal power over me . You jailed me thinking you have got rid of your problem . But you are wrong . . . Dead wrong . Your real problem started the day you locked me here . That day , you locked away your best friend Your conscience I am your conscience When you think you least need me , Is when you need me most . Now the animal in you has gone wild , With nobody to tame it . You are Manima without the m . . . How can you escape from self-destruction ? So you think you have absolute power You are intoxicated on your power You have drunk power to the dregs . Suddenly , you are dumb You hear only what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hoped that I should break down And cry to you for mercy . . . As if you can spell the word mercy . No , I will not break down I left the animal in the cell , But the real me is out away My spirit soars over this cell , This jail , This town , This country , This continent , And this universe . Yes , I am one with the air . . . . Yes , the beams of the sun I knew that I could never really be jailed My ideas go out and they do not come back void . No sir , they do not come back void Every thought and idea is sowed against you To hasten your demise . My ideas against you suffocate you . . . . The gaoler is now the gaoled . How can you escape the chains by which ideas tie you up ? The perpetual traps , Power , money , women . Thought I could never do without women The first months were terrible . . . I even thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A full-bodied male be made female or female another male ? That thought also died . . . . Then everything settled and I became genderless . Forgot everything about the female sex . . . And that I was male I also forgot . . . I was just another soul , Fighting against being trapped in a body , That was trapped in a sex , That was trapped in a cell . In this prison I have now graduated from being a senseless exploiter , I now hate exploitation . I see no dignity in either exploiting , or being exploited I now know that as long as we live by ideas of freedom , Justice and dignity , There will be no prison big enough to contain even one of us . The walls , the bars , the guns and the guards can never keep us jailed . The bodies may be in cell , But the ideas free as air . These ideas are more powerful . . . More potent than your armoured tanks And your murdering battalions . Watch out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom . . . Not the freedom to go through life A compromise to every evil . . . So that I live a life ; half man , half animal ; A life tied to the satisfaction of my wants and desires . I do not long for freedom To just pursue a career , So that I shall get a meal ticket . . . And be satisfied with food clothes and sex . A life not fully man nor fully animal . . . A life tied to petty needs and wants Satisfying nothing but the physical alone . Yet , I long for freedom . . . Freedom to pursue justice for all Freedom to fight the oppressor . . . . Freedom to strike a blow At the juggernaut that pins our neck to the grime . I long for freedom from this dungeon Of oppression , up the flight of stairs , That lead to the house of justice . The freedom that I long for , Can not be won through compromise Nor through apathy and non-commitment . It can not be won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . ( He stretches himself full length on the small bed . His eyes fully awake stare at the ceiling ) . And if lying here , is the cost of my freedom So be it ! ( Pulls dirty blanket round him and sleeps . Immediately he starts to snore , then enters dream state and sequence . Gets up from bed . An Angel arrives and sets a throne and stands by the head of his bed , fanning the still form ) . p. 3 1ST ANGEL Hail King Rehoboam , Hail 2ND ANGEL ( Arrives at the feet of the bed ) Oh Hail King Rehoboam . MANIMA ( Sleepily in dream sequence ) Who are you ? Angels ? Who are you ? What are your names ? Angel Gabriel is that you ? 1ST ANGEL I am not Angel Gabriel I am Angel Mercy . 2ND ANGEL And I Angel Grace Hail King Rehoboam . ( The Angels go to backstage and return to the center stage , mounting a throne upon which they motion the General to sit ) 1ST ANGEL All Hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall King Rehoboam , Son of the wisest man that ever lived . The inheritor of wisdom and wise counsel . 1ST ANGEL Beware the sycophant , The arrogant , The selfish and corrupt politician . MANIMA ( Adjusts himself comfortably on the throne ) . No problems my friends . Either I am dreaming or I am already out of jail . This throne whether in the dream state or fully awake , I claim it as my freedom . My vow , my life , my commitment , My resolve , my mandate Is to eliminate corruption from our national life . ( Sounds of running feet of a large crowd ) . p. 4 CROWD ( cries and shouts ) All hail King Rehoboam Hail , Hail Hail . 1ST VOICE Oh King Rehoboam , Your predecessors made life miserable for us They devalued our currency , They raped our daughters , Denied our children the most basic education . Our society became merely a sickness and burial society . Our oil money they carried to foreign banks for their women and children . They killed us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please help us , and lessen our burden . 2ND VOICE Oh hail King , please lessen our burden , Protect our life and properties Lessen our yoke , so that we may sleep in peace in our beds . Keep our streets safe , Stock our hospitals with medicines And help our sick and dying population . All hail King , Revive our currency , Revive our universities , our industries , Our roads and our pockets . All hail King , Give our farmers fertilizers and good roads to evacuate their produce , Give us stable electricity and effective telephones . Give us education so that we may be liberated ! MANIMA ( Disconcerted slowly dismounts and walks to the audience ) . My friends , Whether you are in this dream together with me or not , I am here with you . What do you say ? You Trade Unionists , what is your advice ? p. 5 TRADE UNIONIST VOICE 1st Kings 12 verse 7 " And they spake unto him saying , If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak good words to them , Then they will be thy servants forever . MANIMA Sounds reasonable , my beloved Economic advisers , what do you say ? ADVISER 'S VOICE All hail King Rehoboam Hail , hail , hail . Let nobody intimidate you . You are king by popular mandate . You are free to rule as you wish , that is true . The world today is not as simple or Simplistic as the time when your predecessors reigned . Their time was when , we were insular , Isolated and were a pariah state . Thank God , that has changed . You tell them , That if your predecessors had devalued the national currency , You will do much more than that . You will permit it to fall to its lowest level Through the market forces and storms . This is in keeping with the laws of gravity That whatsoever goes up , must come down . Tell them , if your predecessors raised the pump price of oil , You are going to allow the queues determine The actual cost of the oil on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to build mortuaries for the dead . If your predecessors retrenched workers , You are going to keep them working But stop their salaries , Killing two stubborn birds with a pebble . p. 6 MANIMA Is that all ? ADVISER 'S VOICE No , not all . Tell them that if your predecessors Permitted them to buy second hand clothes to cover their nakedness You have banned the importation of these loathsome clothes To maintain decency and national pride in the international community . They can go along in their natural suits Given by God , the day they were born . MANIMA Very impressive . This is wonderful , I am sure this came from several months of retreats and conferences . ADVISER 'S VOICE Your Excellency , Tell them it is a disgrace For them to buy second-hand cars , It offends our national pride , And fouls up the ozone layer . The same goes for all second-hand refrigerators . Let them be banned to keep our environment safe . If God had wanted man to drink cold water He would have constructed a fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride in cars , His feet would be wheels . MANIMA ( Walks with renewed confidence and mounts his throne ) My good people We should appreciate , that we have left the dark days Of dictatorship , behind . We are now in the days of freedom . Everybody should be ready to make a few more sacrifices ; A little more suffering and struggle , To make this a better country . I therefore promise you harder but better days ahead . Our lives in the next few years Shall be extremely short , nasty and brutish , But they shall also be days of hope and not despair . We shall bear all this Because the alternative is to go back to dictatorship . God forbid , because that is a condition worse than death . To achieve our economic targets , I have no need of kind words for any of you . You are not kids to be coaxed , Nor women to be flattered , I tell you your rot in your face . Let us get set , To defend our rights to greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 7 1ST VOICE To your tents my clans people , We have no portion in this man . 2ND VOICE To your tents my own clans people , We have no portion with this man . 1ST/2ND ANGELS ( Appear with sticks , which they try to push him from the throne ) . MANIMA Beware , do n't attempt to dislodge me . Do n't make me destabilize you . I am Manima I will kill if need be . ( Grabs 2nd Angels 's stick ) 1ST ANGEL Oh hail the king , When evil leaders plot , good leaders must plan . When evil leaders burn , bomb and kill , Good leaders must build , bind and heal . When evil leaders foam in the mouth With hatred and abuse , Good leaders must smile ; love and embrace . When evil leaders level in injustice and oppression , Good leaders must be just , fair and liberal . MANIMA Did I suffer from prison so that I can sit here , To hear so much nonsense from you ? You agents of destabilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mad dogs at you . ( Sits back on his throne , Angels struggle and push him to the ground ) . 2ND ANGEL Take care you do n't , like the strong headed Rehoboam . Break up your country . For there comes a time , When people get tired of bending , Bowing and scrapping . There comes a time , When the people that bend low Send a small fart of resentment . There comes a time , When those upon whose back you comfortably sit , Straighten their backs , for you to fall . When such a time comes , There is nothing that you can do anymore . ( The two angels force the Prisoner from the throne , and as they take the throne away the Prisoner in trance , hands forward , sleep-walking , slowly crouches by his bed , in prayerful mood , fade out lights ) . ( End of Play. )                             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
