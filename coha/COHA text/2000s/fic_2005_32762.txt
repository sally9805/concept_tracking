Preface Eric Flint The stories in this anthology are all based in the alternate history setting I created in my novel 1632 , which was further developed in the sequel I wrote with David Weber , 1633 . Producing " spin-off " anthologies as part of a popular series has a long and venerable history in science fiction , of course . But , in at least two respects , this anthology is different from most such-and the two differences are related . The first difference is obvious : It is very unusual to produce a shared-universe anthology when a " series " consists , so far , of only two novels . Doing so would seem premature , since the setting really is n't all that firmed up yet . But that was exactly why I wanted to do it so early in the game-which leads me to the second difference : In most shared-universe anthologies , as a rule , the stories are tangential to the main line of the story as developed in the creating author 's own novels . They might be excellent stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much if any direct impact on the logic of developments in the series itself . The reason is simple . Authors are generally reluctant to have other authors shape their own setting , and the contributing authors to an anthology respect that and design their stories to be somewhat " off to the side . " The stories are in the setting , but they do not really affect the setting very much . That is not true of this anthology . The stories in this anthology all feed directly into the development of the series as a whole . They are not simply part of it , they actively shape it . Indeed , several of them have already done so . Many of these stories were written before Dave Weber and I wrote 1633 , and we deliberately incorporated them into the plot of that novel . For example : The character of Tom Stoner and his children , who appear in 1633 and will be major characters in the upcoming novel 1634 : The Galileo Affair , are first introduced into the series by Mercedes Lackey in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 1634 : The Galileo Affair is co-authored by me and Andrew Dennis , and will be published in April of 2004 . Andrew is another of the authors in this anthology . ) The interaction between the Earl of Strafford and Dr. Harvey , which occurs in 1633 , presupposes a prior visit to the time-transplanted town of Grantville . The story of that visit is told here , in S.L. Viehl 's " A Matter of Consultation . " Dave Weber 's story " In the Navy " provides the background for the creation of the new American navy , which was such a prominent part of 1633 . The character of Gerd , who appears in 1633 as one of Captain Harry Lefferts ' men , is first introduced into the 1632 universe in Greg Donahue 's " Skeletons . " * * * A number of the other stories here lay the basis for future developments in the series . That is most clearly evident with my own story , the short novel The Wallenstein Gambit . The events depicted in that story will be central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story is not " on the side . " It is right smack in the middle of the series as it continues to unfold . Furthermore , the basis for The Wallenstein Gambit was , to a considerable degree , laid in this anthology by three other stories : Dave Freer 's " A Lineman For the Country , " Jody Dorsett 's " The Three Rs , " and ( most directly ) by K.D. Wentworth 's " Here Comes Santa Claus . " Andrew Dennis ' " Between the Armies " lays much of the basis for our forthcoming novel 1634 : The Galileo Affair . ( As does 1633 , of course-the character of Sharon Nichols who figures prominently in 1633 is a major character in The Galileo Affair . ) Some of the characters developed by Deann Allen and Mike Turner in their story " American Past Time " will also appear in The Galileo Affair . Virginia DeMarce 's " Biting Time " lays the basis for a novel which she and I are working on , which will both continue the story she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop in The Wallenstein Gambit . To one degree or another , that is true of every story in this anthology . Many of the characters you first encounter here will re-appear in later volumes of the series-and sometimes as major characters in their own right . * * * I wanted to produce this kind of anthology early in the series because I wanted , as much as possible , to capture something which is usually missing in alternate history series : History is complicated . It is not the story of a few people , it is the story of an immense number of people-each of them full individuals in their own right , each of them having their own greater or lesser impact on developments . In the nature of things , fictional series-like biographies-tend to give the illusion that history marches more-or-less in lockstep with the actions of the main characters of the story . That 's almost inevitable , given the very nature of narrative . But it is an illusion , and I wanted to avoid it as much as possible in the unfolding 1632 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff Higgins and Gretchen Richter and the other major characters I created in 1632 will continue to be major characters in the series . But they are not Greek gods and goddesses . They are simply people-and what happens to them will , in the end , be deeply affected by the actions of a Jewish jeweler in Prague trying desperately to prevent one of the worst pogroms in history , a small town Catholic priest undergoing a crisis of conscience , and a woman in late middle age who simply decides to found a school . And ... enough . Welcome to the Ring of Fire . ( Continues ... )
