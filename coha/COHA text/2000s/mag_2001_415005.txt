Forest-Friendly Instruments Make Sweet Music // Greg Gaylord , a self-employed drum maker , works with wood almost every day . The lone owner and operator of aptly named Drum Solo in Novato , California , Gaylord spends his waking hours laboring over the many intricacies of his handcrafted snare drums . Each finished drum  --  its shell hewed from domestic woods like cherry , maple or walnut , or from exotic species like Paraguayan can  --  charana or peroba-is , in Gaylord 's own words , " great-sounding from the get-go . " Each drum is also utterly unique , extremely durable and , in most cases , because Gaylord buys the majority of his wood from a nearby lumber company called EcoTimber , socially and environmentally friendly . A Global Scale Welcome to the latest development in the war against deforestation , species extinction and social and economic exploitation . An increasing number of musical-instrument makers , ranging from companies as small as Drum Solo to those as large and well known as Nashville 's Gibson Guitars , are carving , sawing and sanding their products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest floor to the sales floor and every place in between , " explains Francine Stephens , spokesperson for Richmond Vermont-based SmartWood , one of the country 's biggest certifying agencies . SmartWood , a program of the Rainforest Alliance and accredited by the Forest Steward- ship Council to certify forests and forest products that are ecolo cally sound , considers numerous factors when doing so-everything from the environmental sustainability of forest management and timber-harvesting methods to the effect those methods have on indigenous communities . Through programs like SmartWood and Oakland-based Scientific Certification Systems , as well as similar programs in Canada , Europe and Africa , the Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) has put its stamp of approval on nearly 50 million acres of forest worldwide . To be sure , only an extremely small percentage of certified land 's trees goes to the " green " musical instrument industry . But also true is that only an extremely small percentage of all the world 's trees are used in making musical instruments of any kind . Traditionally , guitars are made from the world 's finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Brazil . Similar woods are used for drums , clarinets , oboes and wooden flutes and piccolos . Because such trees are typically scarce , loggers must destroy massive swaths of forest just to gain access . By the time they 've built roads and bridges and rumbled away with prized logs , they 've scarred the forest and opened an otherwise inaccessible land to habitation . Inhospitable jungle often turns to farmland . Fortunately , such practices are falling out of favor . Instead of pulling logs without regard to the consequences , many forestry operations are now following the guidelines of groups like the FSC . The result is eco-friendly wood and , for sectors like the musical-instrument industry , a brand-new market . Its success depends on a number of factors . For one , consumers have been told for years that the best instruments are made from precious tropical woods like mahogany , ebony and rosewood  --  the very species most in danger . The thought of buying a guitar with an American red-cedar neck may , consequently , be less than appealing . Another problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw materials , claiming there just is n't enough high-quality certified wood to meet their production needs and make the process financially feasible . Certified woods are nevertheless gaining ground among musicians , and by all accounts a program known as SoundWood is leading the way . A component of Britain 's Fauna and Flora International and now based in San Francisco , SoundWood works directly with the music industry , harvesters , scientists , governments and consumers to develop species-conservation solutions . " SoundWood does n't tell the music industry what they should and should not do , " explains Robert Garner , the program 's director . " We work in collaboration with the industry . " In fact , the group has enjoyed the endorsement of an array of bigname musicians , including the Blues Travelers , Roseanne Cash , Don Henley and Bonnie Raitt . Playing It Out Dispelling the belief that certified woods are inferior to traditionally harvested tropical varieties , and so not suitable for instruments , is high priority . " Certifled woods come from the same trees . " says Garner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " According to Garner , environmentally conscious consumers are catching on . He compares it to the market for organically grown food : " The more people understand and ask for these products , the more it 's expected . The market is getting bigger every year . " One of the major movers has been the Gibson Guitar Corporation . The company produced what it billed as the first cost-effective , high-quality , forest  --  friendly guitar , the SmartWood Les Paul , in 1996 . Today , Gibson offers a line of six certified-wood guitars known as the Les Paul Exotics . The instruments feature mahogany backs , curupay fingerboards and tops carved from Paraguayan hardwoods like taperyva , guasa , cancharana , peroba , banara and ambay guasa . Each guitar retails for $1,299 , and a portion of all sales is donated to the Rainforest Alliance . Many other guitar manufacturers , including Fender , Martin , Modulus , the Santa Cruz Guitar Company and Taylor , have followed suit . Novato , California 's Modulus , for one , offers several certified woods for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basses ; their handmade instruments blend sustainably harvested granadillo , chechen , red cedar , chakte kok and soma with high-tech carbon fiber . Up the coast , at Dave Maize Acoustic Guitars in Cave Junction , Oregon , where owner Dave Maize custom builds just a handful of highquality guitars each year , instruments are crafted from less-utilized , sustainably harvested , or non-endangered timbers . " I 've always been concerned about the state of the world 's forests " says Maize . " I decided to make sure my work did n't make the situation any worse . " Much of the wood Maize mills is from " reclaimed " sources : walnut trees downed in road-building , bug  --  killed Canadian red cedar and Engelmann spruce , Sitka spruce salvaged from old logging rafts , and pear trees from demolished orchards . His clients include Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead , Adam Clayton of U2 and Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam . In another conscious effort to preserve rare trees , Yamaha has developed a guitar line and series of snare drums made largely from bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many other ecofriendly instruments-from wood whistles and violins to marimbas-are also available to musicians , amateur and professional alike . Instrument maker Boosey &; Hawkes , for example , offers a line of oboes and clarinets made from a heat-treated mix of African blackwood sawdust , carbon fiber and epoxy glue . The manufacturing process utilizes the entire tree , not just the traditional cuts . The same technique permits old instruments to be ground down and recycled into new ones . Ultimately , instrument makers may choose certified woods over other varieties as a matter of industry survival . According to a recent joint report by the World Resources Institute , the United Nations and the World Bank , the Earth is losing nearly 34 million acres of tropical forest every year . The trees everyone loves so much-for their instruments , furniture and homes-are fast disappearing . A complete shift to sustainable forestry may be the only answer . As Adam Wiskind , retail sales manager at Berkeley , California-based EcoTimber puts it , " There just are n't enough forests . We have to do it this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
