Tying off , shooting up , knocking each other up and around : too many dramatic series have shown urban African Americans doing little else . This six-hour mini-series gets away with it because it 's adapted from a true story ; because Charles S. Dutton directs it with grace ; because T.K. Carter and Khandi Alexander are revelations as a middle-class couple brought low by , and struggling to rise above , their drug habit . The dialogue is at times stagey , and the characters are defined almost entirely through their addictions . But for this last , reality has to share the blame . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
