How special interests can serve the cause of campaign finance reform . <p> DESPITE THE WIDELY HAILED Passage of the McCain-Feingold bill earlier this year  --  the first campaign finance-reform measure in a generation  --  it 's no secret that money still dominates our elections . When you consider all that it takes to run for public office at the national level these days  --  expensive political consultants , pollsters , and the growing cost of producing and broadcasting television and radio ads  --  the cost of a campaign adds up quickly . And that cost is rising . House and Senate candidates spent approximately $2 billion during the 2000 election , and all indications are that the tab for the 2004 elections will Far surpass that . As of early October , President Bush had already shattered previous fundraising records by collecting more than $140 million . <p> As campaign spending has mushroomed , special interests have purchased ever-greater influence . Last year , for example , Congress passed a $73-billion farm-bailout bill . And while farmers are an important political constituency , the lion 's share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small independent farmers who need it most  --  they went to the massive agribusiness farms that are , not coincidentally , among the most generous special interests when it comes to giving cash to candidates and their political action committees ( PACs ) . <p> There are many proposals to fix our campaign-finance system , but each has serious flaws . Many European nations successfully limit the amount of money campaigns can spend , hut in the United States , the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo declared this practice unconstitutional . There 's the idea of banning or capping contributions  --  hut as we 've discovered , these are easily circumvented . Already , lawyers for both parties are scrambling to find loopholes in the ban on " soft money " that was the leading provision of McCain-Feingold , intended to prohibit unregulated large contributions to political parties . The latest innovation is to direct soft-money contributions from business , labor unions , and other wealthy special interests to state party organizations ( which can still receive soft money donations ) and to establish " mini-parties "  --  front organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-money ban . <p> Then there 's public financing . Since the Watergate scandal , public interest groups have championed the idea of publicly financed campaigns , in which candidates receive taxpayer money in exchange for adhering to voluntary campaign spending limits . ( Only presidential candidates can qualify for public funding  --  paid for by the $3 box you can check off on your tax return . ) In the past , this helped to level the playing field between incumbents and challengers : Gerald Ford , Jimmy Carter , and George H.W. Bush all lost their reelection bids to publicly financed candidates . <p> Reformers have long wanted to take the next logical step and employ public financing not just in presidential contests but in House and Senate races , too . Purely as a matter of policy , the idea makes sense . In addition to limiting the influence of special interests in Congress , it would allow lawmakers and candidates to spend more time on the stump talking about issues , and less time on the phone dialing for dollars . It would also eliminate much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling around the country attending congressional fundraisers ( a practice Bill Clinton perfected and George W. Bush has taken to new levels of excess ) . Unfortunately , no one has ever come up with a politically practical way to pay for public financing of congressional general election campaigns . The roughly $250 million raised by the voluntary check-off barely covers the cost of presidential races , and , though the amount was increased from $1 to $3 to make up for the declining number of contributions , the percentage of taxpayers who choose to contribute has dropped from a high of almost 29 percent in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 1997 ( the most recent year for which figures are available ) . The government could , in theory , tap general revenues for this purpose . But the notion of taxing voters to pay for congressional campaigns is one for which lawmakers have understandably shown minimal enthusiasm . <p> All of which suggests that we need a new way to achieve public financing for congressional races . And I have an idea  --  one that would be popular with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Special interests are the biggest beneficiaries of the current campaign finance system , so why not make them pay to clean it up ? Just as we tax gasoline to pay for road repairs , why not charge special interest groups fees to fix our campaign finance system by providing campaign funds to candidates who agree to forego other donations for the general election ? A Special-Interest Toll <p> Here 's how it would work . Every lobbyist , political action committee , political consultant ( yes , pollsters too ) , and government contractor would be charged a fee , either once up front or on an annual basis . There are approximately 25,000 lobbyists , political consultants , and PACs in the United States , and more than 450,000 government contractors and vendors . An annual fee of , say , $2,000 would raise in excess of $1.9 billion every election cycle , more than enough to cover the general election cost of every House and Senate race . This money would be placed in what I 'd call a " Democracy Endowment " ( with full credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This endowment would be an independent entity administered by a board of trustees nominated every five years by the president and approved by the Senate . Any candidates for federal office who agreed not to accept other sources of funding would be able to tap this endowment to pay for their campaign . <p> The precise amount of public funds individual candidates would receive would be based on a combination of factors , including the average cost of previous House and Senate campaigns and the cost of advertising in particular districts or states . Since the program would be voluntary  --  if it were mandatory it would be unconstitutional  --  candidates could choose not to participate and instead finance a campaign with private contributions or their own personal wealth , as Sens . Jon Corzine ( D-N.Y. ) and Peter Fitzgerald ( R-Ill. ) have both done under the current campaign finance system . In order to discourage superrich candidates from opting out of participation in the Democracy Endowment and trying to buy an election , trustees could supplement the amount of money given to participating candidates who have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course that leaves one important practical question : How on earth do you pass a law that every lobbyist and industry trade group in Washington would seem sure to oppose ? <p> The answer is that a surprising number of special interests might , in fact , not oppose it . Here 's why : Corporations like certainty ; they want to How the bottom line . Businesses participate in the current system out of necessity , but by and large would prefer a system in which they paid an established fee to ensure themselves access instead of one in which they were constantly shaken down by political fundraisers . Indeed , some big businesses supported the McCain-Feingold soft money ban out of a strong desire to end the growing number of " requests " from politicians for more and more money . <p> Others will support this approach to cleanse their conscience . While some lobbyists are in the business just to make piles of money , others are former Hill staffers and government employees who originally came to Washington to serve the American public . Many of these folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much happier arguing over the merits of a particular bill or regulation than they would over the sum of money they have to contribute to someone 's campaign to get their issue heard . Moreover , most lobbyists  --  who rank somewhere between lawyers and ivory smugglers in the minds of most Americans  --  would love a chance to rehabilitate their image . It 's hard to imagine now , but once , lobbying on behalf of certain causes and professional organizations was considered an honorable profession . Its importance was so significant that de Tocqueville argued that " in democratic countries the science of association is the mother of science ; the progress of all the rest depends upon the progress it has made . " My proposal would allow lobbyists and lobbying associations to regain their public respect and return to their original mission , disseminating information and analyzing the impact of ideas on different sectors of society , rather than bribing politicians to support the political will of a few well-off individuals or groups . <p> Still not convinced ? Then think about this . Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of senators and representatives could take on an array of special interests and close major loopholes in the tax code . But these lawmakers succeeded by enlisting the support of the one group politicians arc more beholden to than special interests : the taxpayers . By getting their bill to the floor of Congress and framing the vote as a choice between " regular people " and " special interests , " they passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ; lawmakers were more fearful of voters ' wrath than lobbyists ' threats and cajoles . Seas . McCain and Feingold used a similar strategy to pass their soft money ban . Advocates of a special-interest-funded Democracy Endowment could employ similar tactics by enlisting the right political leadership and the support of the elite press . <p> Of course , even if lobbyists were to accept the idea of paying fees for public financing , they would surely fight to keep those fees as low as possible . But this urge , too , could be turned towards a noble end . For years , reformers have argued that political candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to lower campaign costs and thereby reduce the need for special interest money . And for years , the broadcast industry , which makes a fortune from paid political advertising , has blocked the idea . But what if reform-minded lawmakers offered K Street a deal : We 'll reduce the fees you will pay for public financing if we get free TV time ? Suddenly , virtually every lobbyist , pollster , and contractor in town would have an incentive to lean on the broadcasters and on the lawmakers who support them to accept free TV time . <p> Together , these reforms surely would n't stop every campaign abuse . There will always be big-money donors eager to contribute to politicians , and clever politicians and lawyers will always find ways to skirt the rules in order to get that money . Getting all private money out of politics simply is n't an achievable goal . Nor is it a necessary one . The real goal ought to be to put as much distance as possible between wealthy special interests and elected officials who are supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endowment would do that , and it would do so without limiting free speech or starving campaigns of money . It 's time for some political jujitsu  --  let 's turn the biggest source of money politics into the handmaiden of reform . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : In addition to limiting the influence of special interests in Congress , an annual fee would allow lawmakers and candidates to spend more time on the stump talking about issues , and less time on the phone dialing for dollars . <p> By Paul Weinstein Jr . <p> <p> PAUL WEINSTEIN JR . is a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute and teaches at Johns Hopkins University .
