It 's time for President Bush to do something bold . Hah , you say . Bush is all bold all the time . Yes , but his boldness has been pretty much confined to military action and tax cuts . Now he needs a bold stroke diplomatically . The situation on the ground in Iraq is confusing at best , and quite possibly chaotic . It seems increasingly clear that a new government can not be created by the U.S. alone . And so Bush should ask for help  --  not from the U.N. , at least not yet , but from the six countries that are Iraq 's immediate neighbors  --  Saudi Arabia , Syria , Jordan , Turkey , Kuwait , and , yes , Iran . He should invite the Presidents of all six , as well as Tony Blair , to a conference on the future of Iraq . <P> This may seem as likely as a Dixie Chicks concert at the White House , but there is precedent for it . We did it in Afghanistan . The U.S. , Russia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of Five-Plus-Two talks devoted to preventing chaos , tribal warfare and a humanitarian disaster after the Taliban were routed . " You ca n't build a country if the neighbors are trying to pull it apart , " says James Dobbins , a former National Security Council staff member who was part of the American delegation to these talks . " We were able to reach some basic agreements , which led to the Bonn conference , where the rules for the Hamid Karzai government were established . And , I must say , the Iranians were the most helpful of the neighbors throughout the process . " <P> The postwar situation in Iraq is far more volatile than it was in Afghanistan . The neighbors are more contentious , but they do have a common interest  --  preventing chaos in Iraq . " Gaining stability in Iraq will require the support of neighboring countries , including those with which we have an adversarial relationship , " says former U.N . Ambassador Richard Holbrooke . " Our military victory gives us the opportunity to pressure them into working out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past week  --  that Shi'ite militants will form an Islamic republic with Iranian support  --  is unlikely . Iraq has a significant secular middle class . The leading Iraqi ayatullah , Ali al-Sestani , believes in the separation of church and state . The Iraqi and Iranian Shi'ites have a history of mutual disdain and bloodshed . And even Iran 's Foreign Minister , Kamal Kharrazi , said last week that Iraq 's ethnic and religious diversity makes it an improbable candidate for an Islamic republic . <P> But incredibly delicate negotiations lie ahead . The proud , powerful and well-organized majority Shi'ites will have to cut a deal with the proud , well-organized , not so powerful Kurds . ( If the Kurds are given an excuse to declare their independence , both Turkey and Iran  --  countries with large , freedom-seeking Kurdish populations  --  will be destabilized , and a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq is a good bet . ) Even if there is an accord between the Shi'ites and the Kurds , the two will then have to find a place for the Sunnis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottoman Empire . The U.S. is not well-placed to mediate these negotiations . As of last week , leading Shi'ites refused to even participate in a U.S.-led process .
