Small // Moments // " In the years when my parents were broke , Dad would give Mom a daisy for each year they were married . " // - Donna Pizzolongo , daughter of George E. Raboni Sr. // Small moments ? It 's often those little gestures-a knowing look , a pat on the back , an unexpected kindness-that make a big impression and shape our favorite memories . When I came home from college to visit , by the time I woke up in the morning Big Russ had already cleaned my car inside and out ( windows too ) and filled up the gas tank . I once realized too late that I had left behind evidence of a spirited evening the night before , but Dad was nice enough not to mention it . // Dad 's small moments were n't limited to me . When one of my sisters had a hard time , especially after breaking up with a boyfriend , Mom would console her , of course , but Dad would be there too , trying to change the subject-often with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comfort his daughters , but he always tried , and they appreciated his efforts . // As a new father , I looked forward to providing some small moments for my son , and I hope there have been many . I have also been on the receiving end of quite a few , and they started very early . When Luke was two , I went to China with the Today Show . My wife , Maureen , flew over to join me for the final week , leaving Luke with her mother and sister in San Francisco . It was difficult for us to be away from him for so long , and on the flight home I actually found myself wondering if our little boy would remember us . When the plane landed in California , we went through customs , picked up our luggage , and looked up to the glass-enclosed balcony where family and friends were waiting to greet the passengers . And there , next to his grandmother , was our little Luke , jumping up and down with excitement . My heart pounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever seen . // Flash forward about sixteen years . When Luke was graduating from high school , his class asked me to give the commencement address . It was a great honor , but this was the most difficult speech of my life : I had to say something meaningful and inspiring without in any way embarrassing my son . I spoke from the heart and gave the class a kind of blessing : " May you always love your own children as much as your parents love you , as much as Maureen and I love our Luke . " I must have passed the test , because when I finished speaking , the class rose to its feet in appreciation-led by Luke . // Then , one by one , the students came up to receive their diplomas . When it was Luke 's turn , the headmaster motioned for me to take over for a moment . Neither Luke nor I had been prepared for this possibility , and again I wondered how he would react . To my delight , when I gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-foot-two baby boy . I actually had to say , " Luke , enough . Put me down ! " His classmates laughed . It was funny , but there was more in that embrace than humor . // The graduating seniors received their yearbooks that day , and each student had been given a full page to reflect on his high school career . That night , when I got into bed , I began flipping through Luke 's copy . His page began with expressions of gratitude . " Dad , " said the first one , " you 're the driving force behind it all , and my best friend in the world . Thanks for always having my back . I love you . " // Now if you had asked me to identify a specific moment when I had Luke 's back , I could n't point to one . He was reminding me that tender moments are the ultimate wisdom-whether it 's the mutual love and respect that two parents share , a supportive word , or one of the many little comments and gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Small moments accumulate and last a lifetime and , what 's more , they get carried on into the next generation . // I lay back , smiled , and closed my misty eyes . The pillow had never seemed so soft . // THE SOLDIER // A father who wipes away twenty years with a single hug . // One thing I 'll never forget about my father-a hard-as-nails tough-love man who fought in two world wars and a war in Africa during the twenties-was the single tear running down his cheek the day he dropped me off at Fort Dix on my way to Vietnam , and the one hug that made up for twenty-two years of no hugging . Only he could understand what the coming year had in store for me . He could n't even share his sorrow with my mother . Because of her weak heart , we told her I was going to a missile base in Guam . It seemed as if all the years of absence from each other 's lives came together at that moment in New Jersey . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever understand , father to son , man to man , soldier to soldier . // - Joseph E. Colussi , Spring Grove , PA , retired telephone tech , son of Peter C. Colussi , mosaic artist ( 1900-1975 ) // THE TOUCH // It was a routine gesture during an ordinary car ride , but she still remembers it . // As a young child , I sometimes stuttered . Once , when I was six and our family was traveling in the car , I was trying to tell my parents something and could n't get the words out . Stuttering confused me , which caused me to stutter even more . Although this did n't happen very often , it was painful for my parents to witness . That day , while my dad was driving , he calmly reached into the backseat and pulled me closer to him . Then he put his arm around my shoulders and patted my right arm . I remember feeling a sense of immediate calm that allowed me to get the words out . // - Kerry A. Bostwick , Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Bostwick , superintendent of schools ( 1927 ) // THE SAME ROOM // Father Theodore Hesburgh , longtime president of the University of Notre Dame , said it best : " The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother . " // I was visiting my parents a few years after my mother 's health started failing , when my dad had completely taken over her care and the house . I was up early and heard them talking . I did n't want to disturb the moment , and I tried not to listen , but I overheard my mother tell Dad that she was sorry she was such a poor companion these days . She wanted to be traveling and doing things together , as they had often discussed . // There was silence , and then Dad said , in a choked voice , " Do n't you know I just want to be in the same room with you ? " I was struck by the simplicity and love in that remark , as my mother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents for the example of their relationship . // My mother died several years ago . Dad is still alive , but he is suffering from some dementia . He lives with me now , and I have come to understand the simplicity and importance of being in the same room with him . // - Katherine M. Newbold , Peru , IL , FBI ( retired ) , daughter of John M. Newbold , FBI , state police ( 1920 ) // THE LOCK // There is nothing like something that 's just between you and your dad . // My father was a talented man who liked to build things in his fully equipped workshop in our basement . My little brother liked to follow him downstairs to watch and " help " as Dad made such things as chandeliers from old wagon wheels , a rotisserie for our fireplace , and an unusual light fixture out of the copper bulbs that float in the tank of a toilet . // When Jim was seven , he began going to Dad 's workshop on his own , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them , and not replace them . After telling him many times about the importance of putting things back , Dad decided to build a small tool chest with a lock , where he would keep his best tools so my brother could n't get at them . // As Dad worked on the tool chest , my brother watched him and helped enthusiastically . As Dad was installing the lock , Jim asked , " What 's that ? " Dad said it was a lock , and that in order to get tools from the chest , you had to open it with a key . Jim got a strange look on his face . He looked up at his father and asked , " Who will have the key , Dad ? " // Dad paused a moment , reflected on the look on his son 's face , and said , " There will be just two keys , Jim . One for you and one for me. " // - Merabeth Lurie , Hubbard , OH , retired teacher , daughter of Jerold S. Meyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tough thing to hear , and an even tougher thing to say , but within a day they were right back on track . // Coming out to my dad was one of the most difficult experiences of my life , as it is for most young gay men . After all , our dads represent all things masculine , strong , and " normal " - words not commonly associated with the gay community . // My announcement was not exactly a textbook example of how it should be done . Note to closeted gays : Do n't tell your dad during the ten o'clock news , right before he 's going to bed . // Despite my poor timing , my dad responded as many dads do . He cried all night . The next morning , he watched me pass in the living room , my head and shoulders slung low and my eyes focused on the floor beneath me . I was feeling the utter shame of the grave disappointment I had caused him . // By the fourth time our paths crossed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and said , " Look me in the eye . " I refused . Again he said , " Stephen , look me in the eye . " This time I did . With tears rolling down his face , he looked right at me and said , " I love you , Stephen . I do n't care what you are . I just want my boys to be happy . " Then he hugged me , just like he did the day before , when I was straight . // That 's all I ever wanted and needed-to know I would still be loved . Five years later , my relationship with my dad has never been stronger . We still talk daily after each Cubs game . I still ask for advice with my job . And my dad still asks if I 'm dating anyone , although this time around he wants to know if I 've met any good guys lately . // Unconditional love . That 's all we ever want , and I got it . // - Stephen Westman , Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales ( 1945 ) // THE GRADUATE // Just because a dad does n't show his emotions does n't mean he is n't full of feelings . // My father was the strong , silent type who was n't effusive or openly affectionate . // I was the first one in our family to graduate from college . Two weeks before graduation , we were having a normal family dinner when out of the clear blue , my father broke into uncontrollable sobbing . He left the table , followed by my mother . A few minutes later she came back with tears in her own eyes . She explained that my father was overcome by the emotion of my imminent graduation from college , and that if it had n't been for the Depression and the war , this was what he had hoped to do at my age . Never again did I see such emotion from him , and that included my wedding and the adoption of my only son . He passed away more than twenty years ago , but each spring , with the arrival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned how proud strong , silent Stan was of his oldest son . // - David S. Wrobel , Syracuse , NY , retired , son of Stanley J. Wrobel , machinist ( 1918-1983 ) // THE BREAKUP // Time is not the only thing that heals . So do kind words . // When one of my silly boyfriends and I broke up and I thought I was heartbroken , my whole family tried to cheer me up . When everyone else had gone off to bed , my father turned back to me and said , " You know , I love you so much that I 'd marry you if I could . " That was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me , and I was speechless . I do n't think I even said good night . // - Jean A. Astorino , Media , PA , optometrist , daughter of Ross Astorino , equipment operator ( 1922-2001 ) // THE SHAVE // Who ever imagined that the memory of learning to shave with Dad could turn a man 's life around ? // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senseless , unprovoked act of violence that left several scars on my neck . I survived , and the assailant is in prison , but I will never really be the same . When I shave I see one of the scars , and , until recently , to see that scar was to trigger a visual memory of my assailant 's rage-filled face . // The obvious solution was to stop shaving , but that did n't work . I began to remember the terrible event with increasing vividness , until I finally sought help . // My therapist 's first question to me was , " Do you have a good relationship with your father ? " // I said , " Yes . We have a great relationship . " // The therapist asked if he had taught me how to shave . Before I could answer , a memory I had forgotten for many , many years popped into my head , and I smiled . // " Doctor , " I replied , " this is so cool . I remember standing at my dad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shaving . It got to the point that when he shaved in the mornings I was always there , watching him . My dad bought me a little toy razor , with a little knob on the bottom of the handle that opened the top , just like his . The blade was a piece of cardboard that looked like a razor blade . // " After that , I got to smear shaving cream all over my face and shave with my dad . " // My therapist then suggested that I think of this happier memory every time I shaved , to displace the memory of the attack . // And , indeed , the " new " memory has replaced the violent one . Now , when I shave , I feel the love my dad showed me , and I also remember what it felt like to be innocent . My shaving memory marked the start of a long journey best described as posttraumatic growth . // Precious memories are made in an instant and last forever . I am so thankful that my dad had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That memory has strengthened an already strong relationship , and what made me happy then is making me a happier man today . Bless you , Dad . //
