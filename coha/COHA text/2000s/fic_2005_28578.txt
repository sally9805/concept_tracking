Twenty-four hours earlier Khabarovsk , Siberia Nickolai Shubnikov knew how to whittle away his son Vicktor 's pride with the skill of Michelangelo one agonizing chip at a time . " Whoa , Alfred ! Slow down . " Vicktor Shubnikov wound the leather leash twice around his grip and dug in , hoping to slow his father 's Great Dane/Clydesdale . The animal dragged him like a nuisance as he plowed through the row of street vendors , chasing an errant smell . Two years ago Vicktor might have labeled vet duty sweet revenge . Today he called it atonement . Vicktor dodged a babushka hawking a bouquet of lilacs , jumped another pedaling sunflower seeds , and skidded to a halt before the metal canister belonging to a wrinkled woman selling peroshke . The fried sandwiches laced the air with the odor of grease and liver . Alfred shoved his wide Dane snout into the sandwich bag . " Get your beast out of here ! " the woman cried . She whacked at Alfred , who did n't even flinch . Vicktor , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " C'm on , you mutt . " Vicktor grabbed Alfred 's fraying collar and yanked him away . He thrust the woman a ten-ruble note . She swiped it from his hand . " Why do you do that to me ? " They half trotted down the sidewalk , Vicktor hunched over at the waist and trying to match Alfred 's gait . The dog 's black jowls flopped and his saggy eyes gave no indication of remorse . Penance . He cursed the impetuousness that had led to this moment . If only he 'd been smarter , faster , wiser , he 'd be in Lenin Park on this sunny Sunday , slapping shots against Roman , outscoring the former wing . Or maybe he 'd be at Yanna 's volleyball game . The Khabarovsk Amur volleyball team did n't need help from their fans to bury their opponents he went for the pure joy of watching Yanna 's power spike . If only David could see her now . He checked his watch . Noon . Hopefully Evgeny would be in the office . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , and Sunday had been a working day since Stalin outlawed the religious day of rest some sixty years earlier . He muscled the Dane toward the dirt path that led to Evgeny 's office . Vicktor had to admire his friend for carving out his dreams into a private practice . He and Vicktor had chewed away long hours in high school , concocting ways to free the laboratory mice from Tatiana Ivanovka 's biology classroom . Between the pranks , however , Evgeny had revealed the love of medicine inherent to true physicians . Why he had gone into animal medicine still baffled Vicktor . Then again , Vicktor had sworn he 'd never join the militia , and look where he had ended up . Evgeny 's office , a tiny green log house , sat lopsided and forlorn in the shadowy cover of three nine-story concrete highrises . Vicktor turned up the dirt path and shivered as the sun passed behind a building . He shoved his free hand into his leather jacket pocket , wishing he had n't taken out the lining . That morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a cloudless sky and the fresh breeze smelling of lilac had lulled him into believing winter had finally surrendered to spring in Siberia . He 'd jogged home , unzipped the wool lining from his jacket , thrown his shopka on the top shelf and kissed winter goodbye . Now , as he approached the office , his lips felt parched from the cold , and a faint musty odor curled his nose , like the smell of moldy clothes sitting in old snow . The Dane jerked out of Vicktor 's grip and he tripped , glared at the animal and picked up his pace . Of course Alfred would be anxious to see Evgeny ; the vet had treated him for nearly ten years . Two paces before the door , Alfred skidded to a halt , sat on his haunches and growled . " It 's just a checkup , pal . Cool it . " He patted the dog 's head . Still , the way the door hung ajar raised the fine hairs on the back of Vicktor 's neck . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ancient throat , and curled his lips , showing canines . " Tiha . Quiet , boy , " Vicktor commanded . He paused , took a step toward the door and pushed . The door groaned , as if in warning . Vicktor recoiled as the smell of rotting flesh hit him . He covered his nose . Alfred whined . " Stay , " Vicktor rasped , and looped the leash around the door handle . Gulping a breath , he stepped across the threshold . It took all his military training not to gag at the odor that poured from the room . " Evgeny ? " Vicktor surveyed the reception area . Broken glass from the smashed display case crunched under his feet , a cash register lay overturned on a ripped vinyl chair . Whipping out a handkerchief , Vicktor cupped it over his nose and tiptoed around broken vials of animal narcotics on his way to the examination room . " Evgeny ? It 's Vicktor . " Silence . In the examination room , the leather bench where Evgeny examined Alfred on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut like a festering wound . A jumble of medical utensils gleamed like weapons of war where the sun licked the wooden floor . He backed out , a sick feeling welling in his gut . He crept toward Evgeny 's office , rueing the creak of floorboards . When he swung the door open , Vicktor 's blood ran cold . Shards from the ruined glass cabinet littered the carpet . An emptied drawer lay upturned over its contents , a foot-size crater in the middle . Notebooks and ledgers , slashed into pieces , were strewn like stripped leaves . The squash-yellow area rug bled with the black and red dye of crushed pens . Vicktor ducked back into the hall . " Evgeny ? " He heard panic in his voice . He purposely kept few friends , but Chief Veterinarian Evgeny Lakarstin was one of them . With the exception of Roman and Yanna , and two Americans he did n't acknowledge to his coworkers , he depended on Evgeny . He counted him as the type of paren with whom he could share a sauna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicktor 's world , trust was n't an easily acquired commodity . Vicktor headed for the back door leading to the kennels . Even from the hall , the eerie silence gave him chills no dogs barking , no plaintive mewing . Two steps before the back entrance , he spied another door to his left . He 'd thought it a closet before , had even asked Evgeny about it once . The tall vet had shrugged and said , " Supplies . " Vicktor 's eyes narrowed , instincts firing . He grabbed the handle . With a squeak the door opened . He grabbed the door frame and hung on with a white fist as he tore his gaze away , wincing . Etched in his mind , however , was the image of Evgeny lying in a pool of his own russet-colored blood . Three hundred people clapping , cheering , for her , Gracie Benson . It just might have been the worst moment of her life . How she longed to find a safe place and hide from tomorrow . Gracie stood on the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applaud her for two years of missionary work , and felt like a sham . She was a joke , an embarrassment , a failure , and no amount of applause or kind words from Pastor Yuri Mikhailovich could erase that fact . She swallowed hard . She just hoped God was n't watching . Continues ...
