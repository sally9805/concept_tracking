1 Starving for Progress // In the late 1940s , anglers who fished the waters of the Hudson River near // Orangetown , New York , noticed something odd about the trout they were // reeling in : every year , the fish were getting larger . Fishermen rarely complain // about big fish , but because the creatures in question were being hooked // downstream from Lederle Laboratories , a pharmaceutical company , some // may have wondered whether the phenomenon was entirely natural . // Eventually , the fish stories reached the upper management at Lederle , where // they piqued the curiosity of Thomas Jukes , a brilliant biophysicist and expert // in the new field of vitamin nutrition , who decided to investigate . Jukes knew // that Lederle discharged its factory wastes in great piles near the river . He // also knew that one such waste product was a residual mash left over from // the fermentation process that Lederle used to make its hot new antibiotic // tetracycline . Jukes surmised that the mash was leaching into the river and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mash  --  Jukes dubbed it // a " new growth factor "  --  was making them larger . // Initially , Jukes suspected the factor might be vitamin B12 , a newly // identified nutrient that was known to boost growth in laboratory animals . The // vitamin was a byproduct of fermentation , so it was very likely to be in the // mash . But when Jukes and a colleague , Robert Stokstad , tested the mash , // they found something quite unexpected , and even world-changing : although // B12 was indeed present , the new growth factor was n't that vitamin but the // tetracycline itself . When mixed with cornmeal and fed to baby chickens , even // tiny doses of the amber-colored antibiotic boosted growth rates by an // unprecedented 25 percent . // Jukes was n't sure why this was happening . He speculated // ( correctly , as it turned out ) that the tetracycline was treating the intestinal // infections that are routine in closely confined farm animals , and that calories // that normally would have been consumed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make bigger muscles and bones . In any case , the // phenomenon was n't limited to baby chickens . Other researchers soon // confirmed that low , subtherapeutic doses of tetracycline increased growth in // turkeys , calves , and pigs by as much as 50 percent , and later studies // showed that antibiotics made cows give more milk and caused pigs to have // more litters , more piglets per litter , and piglets with larger birth weights . // When the discovery was announced to the world in 1950 , Jukes 's new growth // factor was the closest thing anyone had ever seen to free meat and a // welcome development amid rising concerns over food supplies in war-torn // Europe and burgeoning Asia . As the New York Times put it , // tetracycline 's " hitherto unsuspected nutritional powers " would // have " enormous long-range significance for the survival of the human race in a // world of dwindling resources and expanding populations . " // Jukes 's discovery would indeed have enormous long-range // significance , although not quite in the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century , the global food system was in the throes of a // massive transformation . In even the poorest of nations , thousand-year-old // methods of farming and processing were being replaced by a new industrial // model of production that could generate far more calories than had been // possible even a generation earlier  --  and which seemed poised to end the // cycle of boom and bust that had plagued humanity for eons . But the great // revolution was incomplete . For all our great success in industrializing grains // and other plants , the more complex biology of our cattle , hogs , chickens , // and other livestock defied the mandates of mass production . By the early // twentieth century , meat  --  the food that humans were built for and certainly // the food we crave  --  was still so scarce that populations in Asia , Europe , and // even parts of the United States suffered physical and mental stunting , and by // the end of World War II , experts were predicting global famine . // Then , abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , a // string of discoveries by researchers like Thomas Jukes in the new fields of // nutrition , microbiology , and genetics rendered it possible to make meat // almost as effortlessly as we produced corn or canned goods . We learned to // breed animals for greater size and more rapid maturation . We moved our // animals from pastures and barnyards and into far more efficient sheds and // feed yards . And we boosted their growth with vitamins and amino acids , // hormones and antibiotics ( it would be years before anyone thought to ask // what else these additives might do ) . This livestock revolution , as it came to // be known , unleashed a surge in meat production so powerful that it // transformed the entire food sector and , for a brief time , allowed many of us to // return to the period of dietary history that had largely defined us as a // species  --  and where the story of the modern food economy properly begins . // By most accounts , that narrative started about three million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived in the prehistoric African // forest and ate mainly what could be found there  --  fruits , leaves , larvae , and // bugs . Australopithecus surely ate some meat ( probably scavenged from // carcasses , as he was too small to do much hunting ) , but most of his calories // came from plants , and this herbivorous strategy was reflected in every // element of Australopithecus 's being . His brain and sensory organs were // likely optimized to home in on the colors and shapes of edible ( and // poisonous ) plants . His large teeth , powerful jaws , and oversize gut were all // adapted to coarse , fibrous plant matter , which is hard to chew and even // harder to digest . Even his small size  --  he stood barely four feet tall and // weighed forty pounds  --  was ideal for harvesting fruit among the branches . // So perfectly did Australopithecus match his herbaceous diet that // our story might well have ended there . Instead , between 3 million and 2.4 // million years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and dry out , and the primeval jungle fragmented into a mosaic of forest and // grasslands , which forced our ancestors out of the trees and into a radically // new food strategy . In this more open environment , early humans would have // found far less in the way of fruits and vegetables but far more in the way of // animals , some of which ate our ancestors , and some of which our ancestors // began to eat . This still was n't really hunting , but scavenging carcasses left // by other predators  --  yet now with an important difference : our ancestors were // using stone tools to crack open the leg bones or skulls , which other // predators typically left intact , to get at the calorie-rich , highly nutritious // marrow and brains . Gradually , their feeding strategies improved . By around // 500,000 years ago , the larger , more upright Homo erectus was using crude // weapons to hunt rodents , reptiles , even small deer . Erectus was still an // omnivore and ate wild fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could // find . But animal food  --  muscle , fat , and the soft tissues like brains and // organs  --  now made up as much as 65 percent of his total calories , almost // the dietary mirror image of Australopithecus. // On one level , this shift away from plants and toward animal food // was simple adaptation . All creatures choose feeding strategies that yield the // most calories for the least effort ( anthropologists call this optimal foraging // behavior ) , and with fewer plant calories available , our ancestors naturally // turned to animal foods as the simplest way to replace those calories . But // what is significant is this : even if the move toward meat began out of // necessity , the consequences went far beyond replacing lost calories . In the // economics of digestion , animal foods give a far greater caloric return on // investment than plants do . It might take more calories to chase down a frisky // antelope on the veldt than to pluck fruit in the forest . But for that extra // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fat and muscle // are more calorie dense than plants are and thus offer more energy per // mouthful . Animal foods are also easier to digest , so their calories can be // extracted faster . In all , meat provided more calories , and thus more energy , // that could then be used for hunting , fighting , territorial defense , and certainly // mating . Meat was also a more reliable food source ; by shifting to meat , // prehistoric man could migrate from Africa to Europe , where colder winters // and lack of year-round edible vegetation would have made an herbivorous diet // impossible . // But meat 's real significance to human evolution was probably not // the quantity of calories it contained but the quality of these new calories . // Because animal and human tissues have the same sixteen amino acids // ( whereas most plant-based proteins contain just eight ) , animal converts // readily into human : meat is the ideal building block for meat . That 's why // bodybuilders eat a lot of meat ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more animal foods , their bodies grew larger . Whereas Australopithecus // stood four feet tall , Homo erectus was a strapping six feet in height , and // much stronger , which made him better at eluding predators and hunting . ( The // point is n't that meat made us big but that by eating more meat , our // ancestors could then adapt more readily to an environment where greater // size and strength were advantageous . But once attained , our new stature had // to be maintained , which is one reason our ancestors sought out larger prey // animals ; not only did these big beasts supply a lot of calories , they also // supplied more fat per pound than did smaller animals . ) As important , Homo // erectus 's skull was a third larger than that of Australopithecus , and the brain // inside vastly more developed  --  an adaptation known as encephalization that // was also related to the meatier diet . Just as muscle grows best on a diet of // meat , brains thrive on the fatty acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the omega-3 fat docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and the omega-6 fat // arachidonic acid ( AA ) , which are abundant in animal fats and soft tissues . // Plants have omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids , too , but these are shorter // forms and ca n't provide the same nutritional benefits . // Fatty acids were just the start . The brain is what 's known as // expensive tissue  --  not only does it need lots of DHA to grow so large , it also // needs lots of calories to create all the chemical neurotransmitters upon // which mental activity depends . The bigger the brain , the more calories it // requires , which is why across the zoological spectrum , bigger brains tend to // be found with bigger bodies . A sperm whale , for example , can support a // twenty-pound brain mainly because it also has a massive stomach and heart . // But humans defied this brain-body pattern . In the millions of years between // Australopithecus and Homo erectus , brain size nearly tripled , yet body size // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very large brain // with a relatively small set of body organs . How ? Again , the likely answer was // meat . Recall that meat is more calorie dense and easier to digest than // plants . According to paleoanthropologist Leslie Aiello , coauthor of the // expensive-tissue theory , as our ancestors ate more meat and fewer plants , // they no longer needed the large primate gut to digest all the plant matter . // Over time , the gut shrank to about 60 percent of the size of other primates '  --  // a critical development , as digestive systems themselves consume lots of // energy and having a smaller gut meant more available calories for larger // brains . ( In a similar development , because we were n't required to grind up so // much plant matter , our jaws and teeth became smaller . ) This is not a claim // for dietary determinism : meat did n't " make " monkeys human . Many factors // interacting in complex ways spurred the changes in our ancestors ' // physiology that ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // without more animal foods , their bodies and brains could n't have gotten // larger . And without those bigger bodies and brains , they could n't have // become the intelligent , tool-using , highly effective hunters who were able to // spread so quickly from Africa to the Middle East , Asia , and finally Europe . // It 's probably not entirely coincidental that the several offshoots of // Australopithecus that remained herbivorous became extinct . // In any case , by around 180,000 years ago , as the first of the four // ice ages began , animal foods dominated and defined the human food // strategy . Neanderthals and , later , the Cro-Magnons , the first anatomically // modern humans , were primarily hunters . Each had its own strategies , but // both relied heavily on the mastodon , bison , woolly rhinoceros , and other // arctic megafauna that had been driven southward into human territory by // expanding glaciers . To prehistoric hunters , these big animals were walking // meat markets  --  risky to hunt , but offering a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning as much as fifteen thousand calories per // hour  --  far more than their predecessors . In fact , although Cro-Magnon foraged // for plants and tubers , eggs , insects , fruits , and honey , two-thirds of their // calories came from animal foods , making their diet , as Mike Richards at // Oxford University has shown , nearly identical to that of bears , wolves , and // other " top-level carnivores. " // By the start of the last Ice Age , eighteen hundred years ago , big- // game hunting had become the brutally efficient practice that was celebrated // in cave paintings  --  and that elevated humans to a kind of dietary elitism. // Daily life must still have been solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short : infant // mortality was high , work was dangerous , and treatment for injury or infection // was nonexistent , which helps explain why the average life expectancy may // have been eighteen years . That , coupled with low birthrates ( in part because // infants could n't digest meat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which delayed subsequent pregnancies ) , kept population // growth nearly flat . By some estimates , world population cycled at around one // million for tens of thousands of years . Still , from the strict standpoint of food // economics  --  that is , the quantity and quality of available calories  --  Cro- // Magnon was fabulously wealthy . Indeed , so ideally matched were these // ancestors to their diets that those who did survive childhood trauma and // hunting accidents were probably healthier than most of their modern // decedents : according to Neil Mann , an expert in paleonutrition at RMIT // University in Melbourne , Australia , fossil remains from this early period show // none of the diet-related chronic diseases that plague us today . // The good times could n't last . By 11,000 years ago , a warming // climate had drawn the big , cold-weather game back northward , away from // human settlement . In their place came smaller , faster species , like gazelle , // antelope , and deer , which required new hunting skills and weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrow , for example , was clearly // invented to hit a smaller , faster target . ( Neanderthal , by contrast , may not // have had the ability to update his hunting strategy , and so followed the big // animals into extinction . ) Yet ultimately , new technologies could n't save the // hunting life . By modern estimates , even well-equipped hunters during this // period were probably earning fewer than fifteen hundred calories an hour // hunting small game  --  quite a comedown from the high times of yore . As // hunting success faltered , tribes had little choice but to supplement hunting // with gathering : nuts and berries , edible roots ; peas and other legumes , as // well as various seeded grasses such as wild wheat and barley . This hunting // and gathering , or broad-spectrum , strategy kept our ancestors alive , but // barely . Research suggests that they needed hours and hours of effort , over // many miles of territory , to find enough to eat . As the centuries went by , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around whatever foods // nature made available , were failing . At some point , our ancestors would have // to begin producing food . They would have to become farmers . // If the shift from hunting to farming was largely involuntary , our ancestors at // least had the benefit of excellent timing . The same warming trend that took // away the big animals had also expanded the range of certain edible plants // and grasses , notably wheat and barley , into human territory . Such // expansions had occurred before , but this time was different in several // important ways . First , our ancestors now had a deep knowledge of plants , // gleaned over several thousand years of foraging ; they had certainly learned , // for example , that wheat and barley were edible , and that fruit pits left in a // garbage pile could sprout . Second , they had the beginnings of the social // organization necessary to tackle the complex and large-scale task of // farming . Third , and perhaps most important , they were highly motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored must now have // looked very interesting indeed . // This first agricultural revolution began in different places  --  Central // Asia , Central America , and Southeast Asia  --  and at different times , but the // circumstances were probably similar : humans came across patches of some // wild food  --  wheat or barley , or a root crop such as yams  --  discovered that it // could be coaxed into coming back each year , and settled nearby . By // between 10,000 B.C. and 6000 B.C. , small groups were growing wheat in // Asia and the Middle East , corn in Mesoamerica , and rice in Asia . By 6000 // B.C. , humans had domesticated sheep , goats , pigs , and cattle , although // these spindly beasts were kept mainly for their milk and hides , not meat . By // 5000 B.C. , agriculture had reached every continent except Australia . // Whether our ancestors regarded the agricultural revolution as // progress is n't clear . Farming was brutally hard work , less dangerous than // hunting , perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crop failures // were routine , and even when things went right  --  when , for example , early // farmers learned to use animal labor and were able to slowly increase yields  --  // food challenges only became more complex . The harvested grain needed to // be protected from spoilage and pests . It also needed to be transformed into // something edible and nutritious , since unprocessed grain is almost // indigestible in the meat-adapted human gut . // Eventually , our ancestors learned to grind and cook grain into flat // breads and gruels , increasing the grains ' nutritional value and , no doubt , its // palatability . And yet , paradoxically , this advance probably left our ancestors // with less to eat . Gruel could be fed to infants , which hastened weaning and // thus halved the average interval between births from four years to two . The // result was a phenomenon that would become the hallmark of the food // economy : the virtually static population began slowly to grow , from an // estimated five million worldwide in 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This first population boom was innocuous by modern standards . // And yet , as would be the case in later centuries , this demographic surge // pushed early food-production capacities to the limit . Our ancestors ' meat // intake in particular began to fall  --  with dramatic and quite visible physiological // consequences . Whereas skeletal remains from the high hunting period show // humans to be tall , robust , and relatively disease-free , the early agricultural // period produced a less healthy specimen , one who suffered from various diet- // related afflictions and whose height had fallen by a full four inches from that of // his more carnivorous predecessors and would continue to fall until modern // times . // But our ancestors survived . Their bodies may have craved more // calories and certainly more meat , but farming did generate enough food to // keep them alive  --  if only just . And they got better at it , cultivating new fruits // and vegetables , domesticating new animals , developing new and often tasty // ways to preserve food ( by turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // raising output . Further , if farming left individuals smaller , it allowed early // societies to get bigger . Whereas hunter-gatherers needed many square miles // to collect enough food for survival  --  and thus were forced to live in small , // dispersed , and highly mobile tribes  --  farmers could produce enough food to // feed much larger groups using a fairly small area of land . This more // concentrated form of food production meant humans could live in larger , more // densely populated communities  --  villages first , then cities  --  which became // centers for the technical and social innovations that gave rise to civilization . // Farming was also a source of power . By 3500 B.C. , Egyptian // wheat farmers were routinely producing more grain than they could eat // themselves , and these surpluses , the first accumulated wealth , radically // transformed society . Surpluses provided food security , something // inconceivable to our hunting forebears , and they also gave people something // to trade , thus forming the basis of commerce . Surpluses also meant cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus people could be // excused from the task of making food to specialize in other tasks : they could // be builders , bakers , beer-makers ; they could be potters and smiths , scribes // and artisans and entertainers ; they could be soldiers and defend the new city- // states , and priests and kings , to rule them . Surpluses , note Naomi Miller and // Wilma Wetterstrom , somewhat acidly , " provided an impetus toward // developments we associate with civilization : urbanization , a high degree of // economic specialization , and social inequality . " // For all agriculture 's civilizing powers , however , it left these new civilizations // vulnerable in ways that have never entirely faded . Most obviously , the // concentrated populations in these city-states could no longer feed // themselves yet were now too large to be fed by local farmers using primitive // technologies ; for example , because early plows could only cut shallowly , // farmers tended to work just a thin layer of topsoil , which was easily depleted // of its accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more // remote fields . In a foreshadowing of our own far-flung food economy , cities // increasingly depended on production in distant lands , delivered via ever larger // supply networks that required more and more resources to maintain and // defend . It is no coincidence that the outlines of the Roman Empire followed // the borders of the wheat regions in Europe , Central Asia , and North Africa ( by // 100 B.C. , a third of Rome 's wheat was coming from Egypt , nearly a thousand // miles away ) or that once Rome 's military power failed , its food system // collapsed . In the evolving food economy , food security had become as much // a question of military power and political influence as of agricultural capacity ; // when all three failed simultaneously , as with the fall of the Roman Empire in // the fourth century A.D. , the Western food economy collapsed so completely // that for the next six centuries , global population rose from 300 million to just // 310 million . // Further , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery , it never quite escaped the boom-and- // bust dynamic that had tormented the first farmers , despite a series of // extraordinary innovations beginning around 1000 A.D. A new plow was // invented that cut the soil more deeply and thus allowed farmers to reach soil // nutrients buried farther down . Farmers learned to replenish spent soils  --  by // adding animal manure , but also by alternating primary staple crops like // wheat , which rapidly depletes soil nutrients , with rotations of cover crops , like // beans , that pull nitrogen , a key nutrient , from the atmosphere and biologically // fix it back into the soils . They also learned to select seeds from only the // hardiest plants for future planting , which gradually improved seed quality . And // while these advances were initially discovered through happenstance and trial // and error , as the disciplines of biology and chemistry took shape , scientists // began to understand and , to a growing degree , control natural systems , // especially those systems upon which food production depends , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intertwined with these scientific and technological revolutions was // another even more potent booster of output : commerce . As cities recovered , // demand surged for the crop surpluses that the new plows and crop rotations // were generating , and over time , farmers geared their production to exploit this // lucrative new market . Decisions on what and how much to plant were now // determined less by individual needs and more by the market : whereas a // farmer had once produced the same crops year in and year out , he now // raised whatever brought maximum return , and when prices were high enough , // he even expanded production to fully exploit the opportunities . Landowners in // eastern Europe began growing and selling wheat surpluses to western // Europe . Cattle and sheep farmers built enormous herds in Scotland , // Denmark , and Poland , which they then drove cross-country to sell in massive // slaughtering yards in the large cities , where prices were highest . Enterprising // traders set up vast plantations of sugar , coffee , and tea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burgeoning markets in Europe . Food was // changing from necessity to commodity , its production driven less and less by // sustenance and more and more by a competition for profits . Farming might // still be intimately connected to the land , but from that point on , cycles of // business would be as important as cycles of nature . // This shift into a more modern mode of food production was hardly // easy or automatic . These more commercial food operations were not only // larger but more complex , requiring careful husbanding of various inputs  --  // seed , feed , labor , and eventually technology  --  and thus new organizational // structures and a new set of skills : management . Many operations also // depended on substantial financial backing ( the typical sugar plantation // required vast tracts of tropical land , large pieces of industrial equipment , // skilled craftsmen , and hundreds of slaves ) . This growing need for investors , // who tended to expect a return on their money , only increased pressure on // producers to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a // lower cost . Farmers and traders developed elaborate systems to analyze // market conditions . They scrambled to boost output or lower costs , using new // labor-saving technologies or increasing the scale of their operations , which // spread their costs over more bushels or boars . The payoff was impressive . // Between 1300 and 1600 , grain yields nearly doubled . More to the point , // because farmers now had extra grain to feed their livestock , meat production // increased , and in a harbinger of our own livestock revolution , meat // consumption skyrocketed . By the sixteenth century , the average German // was eating half a pound of meat a day ( almost as much as a modern // American ! ) and across Europe , even farm laborers ate meat at least once a // day . Yet this prosperity would be only temporary . What few Europeans // understood was that their new plenitude did not come primarily from // capitalism , technology , or even God 's grace , but from a demographic // accident : centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black // Death of 1347 , which killed one out of three Europeans ) had kept population // growth from exceeding the production capacities of the food economy . But by // 1600 , that economy was producing so many extra calories that our numbers // again began to grow . Between 1500 and 1750 , world population jumped from // roughly five hundred million to around eight hundred million , while the number // of farmed acres grew hardly at all . It was n't simply the greater numbers that // overwhelmed farmers ' productive capacities ; it was also the rediscovery of // meat . Raising livestock , it turns out , is a rather inefficient way to make food . // A cow , for example , needs to eat seven pounds of feed to gain a pound of // weight , and pigs and chickens were n't much better , which meant that as // meat consumption increased , the demand for grain , hay , pastureland , and // other feed grew at a much faster rate . And while that had been tolerable when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of unused acres , once // population began booming and those unused acres had all been plowed into // fields , the food system came under heavy stress . As early as 1600 , Italy , // France , and the Netherlands all had population densities greater than their // farmlands could sustain , and China and India were not far behind . // The result of this " demographic tension , " as historian Fernand // Braudel calls it , was disastrous . ( Through the sixteenth century , the // European food production system could comfortably handle population // densities of around 77 people per square mile . But by 1600 , Italy had // reached 114 persons per square mile ; France , 88 ; and the Netherlands , 104. // Braudel , Civilization and Capitalism , 61 . ) Between 1600 and 1800 , France // recorded twenty-six major famines , plus uncountable smaller , local // shortages . In Florence , harvests were insufficient one out of every four years . // In 1696 , nearly a third of Finland 's population starved to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so weak from lack of fodder that // farmers had to carry them " like children .

" In the sixteenth century , the beggar or vagrant would be fed and cared // for before he was sent away , " notes French historian Gaston Roupnel .

Some of the damage is reversible if // proper nutrition is restored , but then , as now , malnutrition almost always // persisted into adulthood , where it unleashed a cascade of secondary and // permanent afflictions : low respiratory capacity ; digestive system failure ; // greater risk of infection ; arthritis and other joint diseases ; and arrhythmia and // heart attack .

" In short , for centuries , hunger effectively // destroyed the mental , social , and productive capacities of entire populations . // In 1798 , in a treatise entitled " An Essay on the Principle of // Population , " Thomas Malthus , the Anglican parson turned economist , // gathered these trends into a single pessimistic forecast : humanity was // doomed .

But even aristocrats were forced // to face facts in 1901 ; as Britain geared up to fight the second Boer rebellion , // it was discovered that one-third of the army recruits were too weak to endure // basic training and too short for the army 's minimum height requirement of five // feet . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what // humanity had come to : stunted bodies , shorter lives , and , at some point , // mass extinction by famine . // What turned our fortunes around ? What allowed us to push the Malthusian // limits back and move to an era of superabundance ? In a word , globalism. // What staved off Armageddon was the emergence of an international food // system , built on railways , shipping routes , and new preservation // technologies , and spurred by a nascent ideology  --  free trade  --  that slowly but // surely began to connect the starving demand centers in Europe with distant // suppliers in Australia , Argentina , and especially the United States  --  // countries that not only possessed surplus land and small populations , but // that also were just then undergoing industrial transformations of their food // production . // The United States in particular seemed born to superabundance. // Land was plentiful and immensely fertile ; topsoils in the Midwest were thick // and rich with nitrogen and other nutrients from thousands of years of dead // and decaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // large areas with frequent and reliable rain , provided ideal conditions for grain . // And the federal government , eager to encourage rapid economic development // and westward expansion ( and wipe out the last vestiges of the southern // plantation system ) , gave farmers large tracts of land at little or no cost . // Where a European farmer nurtured his small plot carefully with crop rotations // and manures , his American counterpart had so much land that he worked a // field until the soil was exhausted , then plowed up the next . Moreover , // because U.S. farms were larger than European farms , and farm labor was so // scarce , Americans were quicker than Europeans to adopt mechanical // threshers and other labor-saving technology . As a result , U.S. farmers made // rapid gains in their productivity ; in 1837 , a farmer needed 148 hours of labor // to produce a single acre of wheat ; by 1890 , he was getting it done in just // thirty-seven hours . Even low-tech innovations brought revolutionary impacts : // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation , // and by 1884 , the United States had more than forty million head of cattle  --  // two for every three Americans . // With this rapid mechanization and continued expansion of // farmlands , U.S. food production began to outstrip demand , leading to a // dramatic shift in American dietary practices and food culture . As food prices // fell , the laden table became a national icon . Homemakers and boarding // houses competed to offer the most dishes at every meal ; a typical breakfast , // writes food historian Lowell Dyson , included " steaks , roasts , and chops , // along with heaps of oysters , grilled fish , fried potatoes , and probably // scrambled eggs , with biscuits and breads , washed down with numerous cups // of coffee . " Such conspicuous abundance left many Europeans scratching // their heads .

In the late nineteenth // century , U.S. exports of food to Europe grew from a trickle to a torrent ; grain , // of course , but eventually meat . Not only did America have vast cattle and // sheep herds , but with the breakthroughs in preservation technologies , such // as canning and , especially , refrigeration , that surplus meat could now be // shipped around the world cheaply and relatively safely . It was these // shipments , joined by similar excess cargoes sent from South America and // Australia , that initially slowed Europe 's slide toward starvation . And // conversely , because Europe 's burgeoning industrial centers could now draw // meat and grain directly from producers around the world , rising European // demand began to drive food production everywhere on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Governments might still be called upon to // protect shipping routes and certainly to referee the fairness of trade , but the // food trade itself was now almost entirely commercial , driven less by military // strength and more by price . // So large had the food trade become ( by 1900 , Britain was // importing almost half its calories ) , that our political understanding of food // changed as well . For centuries , nations had sought to produce as much of // their food as possible , importing only reluctantly in times of need . But in a // world where population was soaring and centers of demand and centers of // supply were often not even on the same continent , the idea of food self- // sufficiency seemed obsolete and impractical  --  and even contrary to the // budding notions of internationalism and global fraternity . As one editorialist // put it , each new cargo of food unloaded in London or Antwerp furthered " the // work of weaving in and blending the interests of remote countries , which is // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common objects // and wonderfully complex interdependency . " It was a sentiment that would // resurface many times over the next century , albeit in slightly less florid terms . // There was , however , one final step remaining in the conquest of // scarcity . For the most part , the great surpluses being shipped to Europe // were n't the result of better farming but of more farming : in South America , // North America , and Australia , farmers could grow steadily more food // because they could plant steadily more acres . In terms of actual productivity , // per acre yields had risen little since the Civil War ; even in the fecund United // States , farmers had hit physical limits as to the total food they could // generate from a single acre . If humans were going to truly beat Malthus , we // would need to move past such limits with new forms of agriculture whose // output was not constrained by acres but could grow as fast as the // population . Agriculture would have to become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just new plows or commerce ; // it would take an act of Congress and a breakthrough in chemistry . // By the late 1800s , the leveling-off of yields in the United States caused a // panic in Washington . Without the prospect of cheap , abundant food , many // policymakers feared America would not be able to keep its new factories and // cities booming or allow the nascent middle class to continue on its upward // trajectory . Yet policymakers also realized that boosting food supplies // sufficiently to meet the nation 's economic goals posed a challenge too large // and complex for the private food sector alone and would require enormous // government intervention in the form of laws , agencies , and a volume of public // spending on an unprecedented scale . // To fulfill this vision of a new kind of food economy , during the late // nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Congress created a vast system of // support for food production : a department of agriculture , whose mission was // the provision of affordable food ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maximize output while protecting farmers from harvest failures and // market crashes ; a construction campaign of dams , irrigation canals , and // other reclamation projects to bring agriculture to the desert and semi-desert // regions ; and a massive railroad network to transport this great bounty from // the new areas of production  --  the midwestern Corn Belt , the California " Salad // Bowl , " the western-state ranches , and the stockyards in Chicago  --  to the big // urban areas and export facilities . So integral was government in the buildup of // the modern food economy that years later , Harvard economist Ray Goldberg // described the food system as " the largest quasi-public utility in the world . " // But infrastructure was only the start of this agricultural revolution ; the // improvements in food production that America now sought required // fundamental changes in the way food itself was made . At new federal and // state research centers and at land-grant universities , researchers began // applying rapidly expanding scientific knowledge to the development of new // plant varieties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // 1920s and 1930s , scientists came out with hybrid strains of corn that not // only had bigger , more plentiful ears but also grew more closely together in // the field  --  all of which meant more corn per acre ; between 1930 and 1940 , the // number of bushels of corn per acre doubled , and then continued to rise each // year . // But there was another parallel development to crop breeding that // was in many ways even more important : fertilizers . Traditional methods for // replenishing soil fertility  --  with manure and crop rotations  --  could no longer // replace nutrients as rapidly as the new , fast-growing crops could suck those // nutrients out . An acre of modern corn , for example , will pull half a ton of // nitrogen and other nutrients from the soil during a five-month season . Without // outside replenishment , such soils will become so depleted that the dirt loses // not only its productive capacity but its physical integrity ; it falls apart and // thus becomes highly vulnerable to wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catastrophe known as the Dust Bowl . The solution came in // the form of a new industrial process  --  known as Haber-Bosch , after its // inventors  --  that could pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere , where it exists in // near-endless abundance , and fix it , synthetically , in a convenient and highly // concentrated chemical form , ammonia , which farmers could simply mix into // their dirt . // Vaclav Smil , a resource economist at the University of Manitoba // and an expert in what might be called the global nutrient economy , has // described Haber-Bosch as the most important invention of the twentieth // century , and its arrival did indeed mark a turning point in food production . // Traditionally , nitrogen supplies had been limited to the quantities generated // by plants ; farmers could grow cover crops , which biologically fixed nitrogen // directly into the soils , or farmers could feed the crops to livestock , which then // concentrated the nitrogen in their manure . But in both cases , the supply of // nitrogen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation // crops or feed crops . By 1900 , for example , farmers were committing as much // as half of their total acreage to growing feed or cover crops , which meant that // just half their land was available to produce cash crops  --  a huge constraint in // a world where acres are finite . With Haber-Bosch , however , these natural // limits no longer seemed relevant . Because atmospheric nitrogen was // effectively infinite in supply , there was no limit to how much nitrogen could be // produced and used  --  as long as there was the energy to run ammonia // refineries , which , with the rapid growth of the petroleum industry , there was . // Farmers could apply as much nitrogen as their high-growth plants would // absorb . Thus , for all the importance of the new plant-breeding technologies , it // was fertilizer that actually fueled the explosive boom in grain production ; by // Smil 's estimate , nearly half of the extra food produced since 1950 ( and more // than two-thirds of the extra people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of synthetic nitrogen . // Science had revolutionized the raw materials , or inputs , of agriculture , and it // soon did the same for the outputs . Breeders began designing plants not just // for larger size and faster growth rate but also for uniformity , which would // make them easier to mechanically harvest and process . For example , in an // old-style cornfield , the corn plants matured at different times during the // season and bore their ears at varying points on the stalk  --  all of which // required labor-intensive hand-harvesting . By contrast , the newly developed // hybrid corn produced fields of virtually identical corn plants whose ears // ripened simultaneously and which were set high enough on the stalk to allow // harvest by machine  --  improvements that allowed farmers to produce more // corn faster and at lower costs . // Uniformity quickly became a guiding principle for plant breeding // and for all of industrialized agriculture . The tomato was transformed from a // sprawling bush with soft , slowly ripening fruit to a compact shrub whose fruits // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure mechanized // picking and long storage . Cucumbers were bred to be straighter , for ease of // picking and pickling . As one admiring farm journal noted , because it was // cheaper to breed plants for machine harvest than to design a mechanical // harvester to cope with nonuniform plants , eventually all commercial produce // would be engineered so as to " place the harvested parts in a predictable // position in relation to the harvest machine . " Or as another journal put // it , " Machines are not made to harvest crops ; in reality , crops must be // designed to be harvested by machine . " // But it was n't enough to improve the efficiency of mere individual // crops ; the entire operation of farming was ripe for modernization . Just as // scientists had revolutionized the study of nature by breaking the natural world // into its constituent pieces , such as molecules or cells , agronomists now // sought to rationalize conventional agricultural systems by breaking them into // their constituent pieces , which could then be individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient operations . Farms // had once been diverse , one-stop operations , producing a multitude of crops // for both food and for livestock feed and using livestock for labor , meat , and // fertilizer , but the modern farmer was now encouraged to specialize in a single // crop or livestock species and simply buy his inputs . By focusing resources // and expertise on a single product , a farmer could raise output and lower // costs ; instead of buying different technologies for each of several crops or // animals , he now spread the costs of a single set of technologies  --  for raising // corn , for example , or wheat  --  over more bushels // To be sure , a more rationalized agriculture was far more reliant on // outside players . Synthetic nitrogen , for example , would now be produced // from petroleum in huge new petrochemical factories hundreds or even // thousands of miles away . Likewise , these new hyperefficient farming // operations would no longer process their own outputs ; instead , the slaughter // of livestock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables // would take place elsewhere . And by the end of World War II , a vast network // of commodity buyers and processors had arisen to convert grains , animals , // and other farm products into inputs for the food industry . // Yet this outsourcing of traditional farm functions would make the // entire food system vastly more efficient . Because these new specialists // focused on a single task  --  milling corn , for example , or synthesizing // fertilizers  --  they could operate far more cost-effectively than farmers could , // and they could also focus more intently on improving their technologies // through innovation , which in turn spurred even greater yields on the farm . For // example , as the petrochemical industry perfected methods to mass-produce // nitrogen , the price of nitrogen plummeted , which allowed farmers to use far // more of it : between 1950 and 1980 , farm use of nitrogen jumped by a factor of // seventeen . Importantly , the emergence of defined sectors for inputs and // outputs opened the door to new investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invest in , but Wall Street was more than ready to // gamble on a growing industry that sold those farmers fertilizers and other // inputs and on the big grain companies and food processors that bought those // farmers ' products . // For all intents and purposes , the traditional farm had largely // vanished ; its operations had been separated and reassembled elsewhere in a // new and much larger system  --  a supply chain that began with financiers and // input companies and concluded with grain traders and food processors . The // modern farmer resembled more and more a black box that inputs flowed into // and outputs emerged from , and he bore about as much resemblance to his // old-fashioned predecessors as automobiles did to horse-drawn wagons . So // complete was the transformation that in 1957 , Ray Goldberg , the Harvard // economist , and his colleague , John Davis , proposed that the // term " agriculture " be replaced with a new , more fitting one : " agribusiness. " // By whatever name , the new uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged by the late twentieth century was extraordinarily // powerful . Whereas farmers in industrializing Europe had been proud to double // their yields once a century , farmers now quadrupled their output in half that // time . By the mid-1980s , the United States was generating 40 percent of the // world 's corn , and a quarter of that was coming from a single state ( Iowa ) . And // all this was happening with fewer and fewer farmers . In 1885 , more than half // the U.S. population was engaged in farming ; in 1985 , that share had fallen to // less than 3 percent . // But the real significance of hybrid power was what it meant for // meat production . When they were fed grain , cattle , pigs , and chickens not // only grew larger faster than did their foraging predecessors , they were also // produced much more efficiently . Traditional livestock operations had been // dispersed to give animals the time and space to forage for sufficient calories , // but grain-fed livestock could be confined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal feeding operations , or CAFOs , which allowed far tighter // control of production . And once the production phase of the meat business // had been rationalized , the entire process  --  from the feed mills to the feed lots // to the slaughtering plants  --  could be integrated into one efficient supply chain // under the control of a single company , usually a feed company or a // meatpacker. // This factory farming had its complications . Shifting animals to a // starchy grain diet caused nutrition problems  --  for example , protein-starved // chickens turned cannibalistic , eating one another 's feathers , or worse , to get // enough protein  --  until farmers began supplementing grain with protein-rich // soybeans and amino acids , along with bone meal , blood , offal , and other // protein-rich waste products from slaughterhouses. // Similarly , the crowded conditions in the new CAFOs created // perfect conditions for massive disease outbreaks  --  until operators began // feeding their animals antibiotics ( which , as Thomas Jukes , our fish detective , // showed , also accelerated growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific solution , farmers were able to generate more meat at a lower cost // and in a much smaller space ; today , the standard index of livestock // productivity is " pounds per square foot . " And as output rose and prices fell , // consumption once again soared . In 1945 , the average American ate around // 125 pounds of meat a year ; by 1980 , per capita consumption had reached // 195 pounds , an increase of nearly 60 percent . // The impacts of this new high-volume , low-cost production rippled // across entire societies . As protein consumption rose , populations // accumulated what Robert Fogel calls " physiological capital "  --  stronger bodies // and organs capable of resisting disease ; by 1980 , life expectancy for the // average Western male was around sixty-five years , and he stood five foot ten // inches in height  --  three inches taller than he had as recently as the Civil // War  --  while the average woman went from 63.5 to 65 inches . The average // British man was now nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As labor // requirements fell , farmers moved to the cities to take better-paying factory // jobs , and everyone was paying less and less for food each year . In 1900 , the // average American family spent half its household income on food ; by 1980 , // that share had dropped to less than 15 percent . Declining food costs meant // Americans had more money to spend on other things , like bigger houses , // nicer cars , education , and health care  --  the essentials of the American // Dream . In this sense , the modernization of food production marks one of the // biggest transfers of wealth in human history . And it was n't only the industrial // West that was benefiting . Between 1950 and the late 1990s , world output of // corn , wheat , and the cereal crops more than tripled , which meant that even // though world population more than doubled , from 2.5 billion to 6 billion , the // volume of food available for each person rose from fewer than 2,400 calories // per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of such bounty , one can hardly be surprised that by // the end of the twentieth century , official attitudes about agriculture and food // production in the United States , Europe , and other industrialized nations // began to take on distinctly triumphal tones . In the opinion of most // agronomists and agricultural economists , there really was n't any limit to this // industrial plenitude . Under the new agribusiness model , the farm had become // an utterly rational enterprise in which ever larger inputs of capital  --  in the // form of seeds , fertilizers , pesticides , machines , fuel , and research  --  // delivered predictable increases in output and profit . In the new food economy , // human destinies would no longer be driven by the age-old fear of boom and // bust but by , as economist John Perkins put it , " a powerful vision of the nation- // state as an industrial economy in which all natural resources , including // agriculture , could be marshaled by the rational control of modern science . " // And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States  --  a // nation that , with just 5 percent of the world 's population , generated a sixth of // the world 's meat and nearly half its soybeans and corn and wielded such // control over global grain and food markets that by the 1980s , in the words of // one foreign diplomat , it had attained " a position similar to that of OPEC in the // field of energy . " // For all its efficiency and controlled abundance , the new modern food // economy was rife with contradictions . Production was booming in much of // the world , but it flagged in places like Africa , where antiquated farm methods // barely kept pace with rising populations , and even the United States still had // large pockets of hunger . Food production might require less labor , but its // greater reliance on labor-saving mechanization and chemicals made farming // and other food-production jobs among the most dangerous occupations in the // world . Global trade was helping to build food security for wealthy importers , // but the search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama , India , and Malaysia into vast plantations of coffee and tea , // sugar and bananas  --  all bound for the tables of middle-class consumers in // Europe , Japan , and the United States . // Moreover , there was a growing sense in some quarters , and // certainly among agriculture producers , that the machine was out of control . // The treadmill effect was becoming more and more pronounced : the more // bushels farmers were able to grow on each acre and the greater the volumes // of grain that farmers were able to put onto the market , the lower that prices // for that grain fell  --  a boon for consumers , but a slow-motion disaster for // farmers and other producers . In most other businesses , declining prices are // a signal to companies to produce less ; restrict output , and supply will // eventually fall , at which point prices will rise . But agriculture has always been // different . Because the biggest and costliest input is land , farmers have far // less flexibility in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // prices by , say , laying off half his labor force ( labor being his biggest cost ) , // farmers ca n't lay off their land . In most cases , they must continue to farm // those acres in order to make mortgage or rent payments ; land is a fixed // cost , over which farmers have very little control . Thus , as the price per bushel // continues to fall , farmers compensate by spreading their fixed costs over // more bushels per acre , which they generally accomplish by buying new // seeds , better fertilizers , bigger tractors , or some other new technology . // Unfortunately , while growing more bushels maintains their income in the // short term , the cost of all that new technology has to be spread over even // more bushels , which simply adds to an already oversupplied market and // pushes prices down further  --  a vicious cycle wherein farmers are essentially // producing more and more bushels each year simply to keep from going under . // Eventually , however , the treadmill became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the small and medium-size farms that // lacked the scale to keep spreading their costs or the capital to buy new // technology were pushed out , replaced by huge industrial farming operations // that could make up in volume and efficiencies what they were losing in price . // By the mid-1980s , the U.S. farm system had been so consolidated that more // than two-thirds of the nation 's entire agriculture output was now coming from // less than one-third of the farms . // Social commentators called this the farm crisis , but the same // dynamic of price-led consolidation has become a defining trait of the entire // food economy . Up and down the supply chain , the smaller , less efficient // producers have been pushed out or gobbled up , leaving each sector in the // hands of a small number of enormous players with the massive volume and // economies of scale to remain profitable . By the 1980s , a handful of // petrochemical and pharmaceutical companies controlled most of the seed , // fertilizer , and pesticide businesses , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the meat business . Similarly , the bulk of U.S. grain // was being managed by just three grain trading companies , Cargill and // Continental ( which would later merge ) and Archer Daniels Midland . This tiny // number of buyers meant farmers had few options as to where to sell their // grain , and thus little choice but to accept whatever low prices these buyers // offered , all of which simply accelerated the treadmill syndrome . // Farmers had become price takers  --  that is , forced to accept // whatever the market was paying  --  while the big buyers of grain and other // commodities were increasingly the price makers , who could dictate terms . In // yet another perverse dimension of the economics of food , farming had // become what economists call a " perfect competition , " with neighbors fighting // to undersell one another by fractions of pennies per bushel  --  while the market // they sold to moved toward becoming the " perfect monopoly . " Uniformity and // specialization had been the hallmarks of the early modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting legacy . // And there were other , less quantifiable impacts of the high- // volume , low-cost model . The flood of cheap food that had been so critical in // helping societies regain physical and economic health emerged as a liability . // Governments struggled to cope with the surpluses generated by their overly // successful farm programs : in the United States and Europe , lawmakers had // to pay farmers billions of dollars a year to grow less food . Likewise , as the // price of commodities plummeted , food processors had to go to greater and // greater lengths to " add value " to those commodities and thus maintain their // own profits . As well , by the 1980s , it was clear that many of the populations // that had struggled to get enough calories were now struggling to keep from // eating too many calories . In the United States , as the physical demands of // our work dropped , the amount of fuel available for each of us soared  --  from // 3,100 calories in 1950 to nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this excess wound up in landfills , the result of a food chain that had grown // incredibly wasteful , our expanding girths suggested that at least some of // these extra calories were reaching their targets . // And bizarrely , for all the staggering output and perpetual // oversupply , there were troubling signs that our capacity for such // superabundance was limited . Although demand showed no signs of slowing  --  // in fact , each new breakthrough in yields still spurred a Malthusian surge in // population growth  --  our new massively high output levels were becoming // harder to maintain . Our new supercrops turned out to need more protection // from weeds and insects , necessitating ever greater applications of // pesticides , much of which found its way into the streams , rivers , and water // wells of farming regions . ( By the late 1970s , federal scientists identified // agriculture as the biggest single source of nonpoint water pollution. ) // Similarly , soils in some regions were being so overfarmed that more fertilizers // had to be applied every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // cases , yields kept falling anyway  --  a trend that , given the critical link // between cheap grain and cheap meat , raised troubling questions about our // triumphal return to a more carnivorous diet . In nearly every sector of the food // economy , our very success seemed to have caught up with us . After // spending centuries to build a food economy that could free us from want , we // would spend the next decades coping with the costs of that victory //
