He noticed her the moment she stepped into the pavilion . Even in a crowd of other women dressed , for the most part , in skimpy summer clothing , she was definitely a standout . Surprisingly , she was alone . As she paused to get her bearings , her gaze stopped briefly on the dais , where the band was performing , before moving to the dance floor , then to the haphazard arrangement of chairs and tables surrounding it . Spotting a vacant table , she moved to it and sat down . The pavilion was round in shape , about thirty yards in diameter . Although it was an open-air structure with a conical roof , the underside of which was strung with clear Christmas lights , the pitched ceiling trapped the noise inside , making the din incredible . What the band lacked in musical talent they made up for with volume , obviously of the opinion that decibels would make their missed notes less discernible . They did , however , play with raucous enthusiasm and showmanship . On the keyboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their instruments . The harmonica player 's braided beard bounced with every jerking motion of his head . As the fiddler sawed his bow across the strings , he danced an energetic jig that showed off his yellow cowboy boots . The drummer seemed to know only one cadence , but he applied himself to it with verve . The crowd did n't seem to mind the discordant sound . For that matter , neither did Hammond Cross . Ironically , the racket of the county fair was somehow soothing . He absorbed the noise-the squeals coming from the midway , catcalls from rowdy teenage boys at the top of the Ferris wheel , the crying of babies grown tired , the bells and whistles and horns , the shouts and laughter inherent to a carnival . Going to a county fair had n't been on his agenda today . Although there had probably been some advance publicity about it in the local newspaper and on TV , it had escaped his notice . He 'd happened on the fair by accident about a half hour outside of Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know . It was n't like he was an avid carnival-goer . His parents certainly had never taken him to one . They had avoided general-public attractions like this at all costs . Not exactly their crowd . Not their kind of people . Ordinarily Hammond probably would have avoided it , too . Not because he was a snob , but because he worked such long , hard hours , he was selfish with his leisure time and selective about how he spent it . A round of golf , a couple hours of fishing , a movie , a quiet dinner at a good restaurant . But a county fair ? That would n't have topped his list of pleasurable pursuits . But this afternoon in particular the crowd and the noise appealed to him . Left alone , he only would have brooded over his troubles . He would have reflected himself into despondency , and who needed that on one of the few remaining weekends of the summer ? So when his highway speed was reduced to a crawl and he got trapped in the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot by an enterprising farmer-he had remained in line with the other cars and vans and SUVs . He paid two bucks to the tobacco-chewing youth who was collecting for the farmer and was fortunate enough to find a spot for his car beneath a shade tree . Before getting out , he removed his suit jacket and tie , and rolled up his shirtsleeves . As he picked his way carefully around cow patties , he wished for blue jeans and boots instead of dress slacks and loafers , but already he felt his spirits rising . Nobody here knew him . He did n't have to talk to anyone if he did n't want to . There were no obligations to be met , no meetings to attend , no telephone messages to return . Out here he was n't a professional , or a colleague . Or a son . Tension , anger , and the weight of responsibility began to melt off him . The sense of freedom was heady . The fairgrounds were demarcated by a plastic rope strung with multicolored pennants that hung still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redolent with the tantalizing aromas of cooking food-junk food . From a distance , the music did n't sound half bad . Hammond was immediately glad he had stopped . He needed this . . . isolation . Because despite the people streaming through the turnstile , he was , in a very real sense , isolated . Being absorbed by a large , noisy crowd suddenly seemed preferable to spending a solitary evening in his cabin , which had been his original plan upon leaving Charleston . The band had played two songs since the auburn-haired woman had sat down across the pavilion from where he was seated . Hammond had continued to watch her , and to speculate . Most likely she was waiting for someone to join her , probably a husband and assorted children . She appeared to be not quite as old as he , maybe early thirties . About the age of the carpool-driving set . Cub Scout den mothers . PTA officers . The homemakers concerned with DPT booster shots , orthodontia , and getting their laundry whites white and their colors bright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV commercials , but she seemed to fit that general demographic . Except that she was a little too . . . too . . . edgy . She did n't look like a mother of young children who was enjoying a few minutes ' respite while Daddy took the kids for a ride on the carousel . She did n't have the cool , competent air of his acquaintances ' wives who were members of Junior League and other civic clubs , who went to salad luncheons and hosted birthday parties for their kids and dinner parties for their husbands ' business associates , and who played golf or tennis at their respective country clubs once or twice a week between their aerobics classes and Bible study circles . She did n't have the soft , settled body of a woman who had borne two or three offspring , either . Her figure was compact and athletic . She had good-no , great-legs that were muscled , sleek , and tan , shown off by a short skirt and low-heeled sandals . Her sleeveless top had a scooped neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been knotted loosely around her neck before she had removed it . The outfit was smart and chic , a cut above what most of this shorts-and-sneakers crowd was wearing . Her handbag , which she 'd placed on the table , was big enough only for a key ring , a tissue , and possibly a lipstick , but nowhere near large enough for a young mother whose purse was packed with bottled water and Handi Wipes and natural snacks and enough equipment to survive days in the wilderness should an emergency situation arise . Hammond had an analytical mind . Deductive reasoning was his forte . So he concluded , with what he felt was a fair degree of accuracy , that it was unlikely this woman was a mom . That did not mean that she was n't married , or otherwise attached , and waiting to be joined by a significant other , whoever he might be and whatever the nature of their relationship . She could be a woman devoted to a career . A mover and a shaker in the business community . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A loan officer . Sipping his beer , which was growing tepid in the heat , Hammond continued to stare at her with interest . Then suddenly he realized that his stare was being returned . When their eyes met , his heart lurched , perhaps from embarrassment for having been caught staring . But he did n't look away . Despite the dancers that passed between them , intermittently blocking their line of sight , they maintained eye contact for several seconds . Then she abruptly broke it , as though she might also be embarrassed for having picked him out of the crowd . Chagrined over having such a juvenile reaction to something as insignificant as making eye contact , Hammond relinquished his table to two couples who 'd been hovering nearby waiting for one to become available . He weaved his way through the press of people toward the temporary bar . It had been set up during the fair to accommodate the thirsty dancers . It was a popular spot . Personnel from the various military bases in the area were standing three deep at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their sheared heads . They were drinking , scoping out the girls , weighing their chances of getting lucky , wagering on who would and who would n't , playing one-upmanship . The bartenders were dispensing beer as fast as they could , but they could n't keep up with the demand . Hammond tried several times to flag one 's attention but finally gave up and decided to wait until the crowd had thinned out before ordering another . Feeling a little less pathetic than he had no doubt looked sitting alone at his table , he glanced across the dance floor toward her table . His spirits drooped . Three men now occupied the extra chairs at her table . In fact , the wide shoulders of one were blocking her from Hammond 's view . The trio were n't in uniform , but judging by the severity of their haircuts and their cockiness he guessed they were marines . Well , he was n't surprised . Disappointed , but not surprised . She was too good-looking to be alone on a Saturday night . She 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if she had come to the fair alone , she would n't have remained dateless for long . Not at a meat market like this . An unattached serviceman with a weekend pass had the instincts and singlemindedness of a shark . He had one purpose in mind , and that was to secure a female companion for the evening . Even without trying , this one would have attracted attention . Not that he had been thinking about picking her up , Hammond told himself . He was too old for that . He would n't regress to a frat-rat mentality , for crying out loud . Besides , it really would n't be proper , would it ? He was n't exactly committed , but he was n't exactly uncommitted , either . Suddenly she stood up , grabbed her cardigan , slung the strap of her small purse over her shoulder , and turned to leave . Instantly the three men seated with her were on their feet , crowding around her . One , who appeared to be hammered , placed his arm across her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his lips moving ; whatever he was saying to her made his companions laugh uproariously . She did n't think it was funny . She averted her head , and it appeared to Hammond that she was trying to extricate herself from an awkward situation without causing a scene . She took the serviceman 's arm and removed it from around her neck and , smiling stiffly , said something to him before once again turning as though to leave . Not to be put off , and goaded by his two friends , the spurned one went after her . When he reached for her arm and pulled her around again , Hammond acted . Later , he did n't remember crossing the dance floor , although he must have practically plowed his way through the couples now swaying to a slow dance , because within seconds he was reaching between two of the muscle-bound , hard-bellied marines , shoving the persistent one aside , and hearing himself say , " Sorry about that , honey . I ran into Norm Blanchard and you know how that son-of-a-gun can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . " Curving his arm around her waist , he drew her out with him onto the dance floor . * * * " You got my instructions ? " " Yes , sir , Detective . No one else comes in , no one leaves . We 've sealed off all the exits . " " That includes everybody . No exceptions . " " Yes , sir . " Having made his orders emphatic , Detective Rory Smilow nodded to the uniformed officer and entered the Charles Towne Plaza through the hotel 's main doors . The staircase had been touted by numerous design magazines to be an architectural triumph . Already it had become the signature feature of the new complex . Epitomizing southern hospitality , two arms of wide steps swept up from the lobby floor . They seemed to be embracing the incredible crystal chandelier , before merging forty feet above the lobby to form the second-story gallery . On both levels of the lobby policemen were mingling with hotel guests and employees , all of whom had heard by now that there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing created this kind of expectant atmosphere like a killing , Smilow thought as he assessed the scene . Sunburned , perspiring , camera-toting tourists milled around , asking questions of anyone in authority , talking among themselves , speculating on the identity of the victim and what had provoked the murder . In his well-tailored suit and French cuff shirt , Smilow was conspicuously overdressed . Despite the sweltering heat outside , his clothing was fresh and dry , not even moist . An irritated subordinate had once asked beneath his breath if Smilow ever sweated . " Hell , no , " a fellow policeman had replied . " Everybody knows that aliens do n't have sweat glands . " Smilow moved purposefully toward the bank of elevators . The officer he 'd spoken with at the entrance must have communicated his arrival because another officer was standing in the elevator , holding the door open for him . Without acknowledging the courtesy , Smilow stepped in . " Shine holding up , Mr. Smilow ? " Smilow turned . " Oh yeah , Smitty . Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated three shoeshine chairs in an alcove off the hotel lobby . For decades he had been a fixture at another hotel downtown . Recently he had been lured to the Charles Towne Plaza , and his clientele had followed him . Even from out-of-towners he received excellent tips because Smitty knew more than the hotel concierge about what to do , and where to go , and where to find whatever you were looking for in Charleston . Rory Smilow was one of Smitty 's regulars . Ordinarily he would have paused to exchange pleasantries , but he was in a hurry now and actually resented being detained . Curtly he said , " Catch you later , Smitty . " The elevator doors slid closed . He and the uniformed cop rode up to the top floor in silence . Smilow never fraternized with fellow officers , not even those of equal ranking , but certainly not with those of lower rank . He never initiated conversation unless it pertained to a case he was working on . Men in the department who were fearless enough to try chitchatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bearing discouraged comradeship . Even his natty appearance was as effective as concertina wire when it came to approachability . When the elevator doors opened on the fifth floor , Smilow experienced a thrill he recognized . He had visited countless murder scenes , some rather tame and unspectacular , others remarkably grisly . Some were forgettable and routine . Others he would remember forever , either because of the imaginative flair of the killer , the strange surroundings in which the body had been discovered , the bizarre method of execution , the uniqueness of the weapon , or the age and circumstance of the victim . But his first visit to a crime scene never failed to give him a rush of adrenaline , which he refused to be ashamed of . This was what he had been born to do . He relished his work . When he stepped out of the elevator , the conversation among the plainclothes officers in the hallway subsided . Respectfully , or fearfully , they stepped aside for him as he made his way to the open door of the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of the room number , then peered inside . He was glad to see that the seven officers comprising the Crime Scene Unit were already there , going about their various duties . Satisfied that they were doing a thorough job , he turned back to the three detectives who 'd been dispatched by the Criminal Investigation Division . One who 'd been smoking a cigarette hastily crushed it out in a smoking stand . Smilow treated him to a cold , unblinking stare . " I hope that sand did n't contain a crucial piece of evidence , Collins . " The detective stuffed his hands into his pockets like a third-grader who 'd been reprimanded for not washing after using the rest room . " Listen up , " Smilow said , addressing the group at large . He never raised his voice . He never had to . " I will not tolerate a single mistake . If there 's any contamination of this crime scene , if there 's the slightest breach of proper procedure , if the merest speck of evidence is overlooked or compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shredded . By me . Personally . " He made eye contact with each man . Then he said , " Okay , let 's go . " As they filed into the room they pulled on plastic gloves . Each man had a specific task ; each went to it , treading lightly , touching nothing that they were n't supposed to . Smilow approached the two officers who had been first on the scene . Without preamble , he asked , " Did you touch him ? " " No , sir . " " Touch anything ? " " No , sir . " " The doorknob ? " " The door was standing open when we got here . The maid who found him had left it open . The hotel security guard might have touched it . We asked , he said no , but . . . " He raised his shoulders in a shrug . " Telephone ? " Smilow asked . " No , sir . I used my cellular . But again , the security guy might have used it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so far ? " " Only him . He 's the one who called us . " " And what did he say ? " " That a chambermaid found the body . " He indicated the corpse . " Just like this . Face down , two gunshot wounds in his back beneath the left shoulder blade . " " Have you questioned the maid ? " " Tried . She 's carryin ' on so bad we did n't get much out of her . Besides , she 's foreign . Do n't know where she 's from , " the cop replied to Smilow 's inquiring raised eyebrow . " Ca n't tell by the accent . She just keeps saying over and over , ' Dead man , ' and boo-hooing into her hankie . Scared her shitless . " " Did you feel for a pulse ? " The officer glanced at his partner , who spoke for the first time . " I did . Just to make sure he was dead . " " So you did touch him . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take it you did n't feel one . " " A pulse ? " The cop shook his head . " No . He was dead . No doubt . " Up to this point , Smilow had ignored the body . Now he moved toward it . " Anybody heard from the M.E. ? " " On his way . " The answer registered with Smilow , but he was intently gazing at the dead man . Until he saw it with his own eyes , he had been unable to believe that the reported murder victim was none other than Lute Pettijohn . A local celebrity of sorts , a man of renown , Pettijohn was , among other things , CEO of the development company that had converted the derelict cotton warehouse into the spectacular new Charles Towne Plaza . He had also been Rory Smilow 's brother-in-law . ( c ) 1999 by Sandra Brown "
