Chapter One We have Beth from Tampa on the line . Hello . " " Hi , Kitty , thanks for taking my call . " " You 're welcome . " " I have a question I 've been wanting to ask for a long time . Do you think Dracula is still out there ? " I leaned on the arm of my chair and stared at the microphone . " Dracula . As in , the book ? The character ? " Beth from Tampa sounded cheerful and earnest . " Yeah . I mean , he 's got to be the best-known vampire there is . He was so powerful , I ca n't really believe that Van Helsing and the rest of them just finished him off . " I tried to be polite . " Actually , they did . It 's just a book , Beth . Fiction . They 're characters . " " But you sit there week after week telling everyone that vampires and werewolves are real . Surely a book like this must have been based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually Dracula , but Bram Stoker must have based him on a real vampire , do n't you think ? Do n't you wonder who that vampire was ? " Stoker may have met a real vampire , may even have based Dracula on that vampire . But if that vampire was still around , I suspected he was in deep hiding out of embarrassment . " Even if there is a real vampire who was Stoker 's inspiration , the events of the book are sheer fabrication . I say this because Dracula isn'treally about vampires , or vampire hunting , or the undead , or any of that . It 's about a lot of other things : sexuality , religion , reverse imperialism , and xenophobia . But what it 's really about is saving the world through superior office technology . " I waited half a beat for that to sink in . I loved this stuff . " Think about it . They make such a big deal about their typewriters , phonographs , stenography-this was like the techno-thriller of its day . They end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collating . What do you think ? " " Um ... I think that may be a stretch . " " Have you even read the book ? " " Um , no . But I 've seen every movie version of it ! " she ended brightly , as if that would save her . I suppressed a growl . " All right . Which is your favorite ? " " The one with Keanu Reeves ! " " Why am I not surprised ? " I clicked her off . " Moving on . Next caller , you 're on the air . " " Kitty , hey ! Longtime listener , first-time caller . I 'm so glad you put me on . " " No problem . What 's your story ? " " Well , I have sort of a question . Do you have any idea what kind of overlap there is between lycanthropes and the furry community ? " The monitor said this guy had a question about lycanthropes and alternative lifestyles . The producer screening calls was doing a good job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually . It seemed I 'd avoided it for as long as I possibly could . Oh well . The folks in radioland expected honesty . " You know , I 've hosted this show for almost a year without anyone bringing up furries . Thank you for destroying that last little shred of dignity I possessed . " " You do n't have to be so- " " Look , seriously . I have absolutely no idea . They 're two different things-lycanthropy is a disease . Furry-ness is a ... a predilection . Which I suppose means it 's possible to be both . And when you say furry , are you talking about the people who like cartoons with bipedal foxes , or are you talking about the people who dress up in animal suits to get it on ? Maybe some of the people who call in wanting to know how to become werewolves happen to be furries and think that 's the next logical step . How many of the lycanthropes that I know are furries ? That 's not something I generally ask people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , yeah . But I have to wonder , if someone really believes that they were meant to be , you know , a different species entirely-like the way some men really believe they were meant to be women and then go through a sex change operation-do n't you think it 's reasonable that- " " No . No it is n't reasonable . Tell me , do you think that you were meant to be a different species entirely ? " He gave a deep sigh , the kind that usually preceded a dark confession , the kind of thing that was a big draw for most of my audience . " I have this recurring dream where I 'm an alpaca . " I did a little flinch , convinced I had n't heard him correctly . " Excuse me ? " " An alpaca . I keep having these dreams where I 'm an alpaca . I 'm in the Andes , high in the mountains . In the next valley over are the ruins of a great Incan city . Everything is so green . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of National Geographic . " And the grass tastes so lovely . " Okay , that probably was n't in National Geographic . " Um ... that 's interesting . " " I 'd love to travel there someday . To see the Andes for myself . Have-have you by any chance ever met any were-alpacas ? " If it were n't so sad I 'd have to laugh . " No , I have n't . All the were-animals I 've ever heard of are predators , so I really do n't think you 're likely to meet a were-alpaca . " " Oh , " he said with a sigh . " Do you think maybe I was an alpaca in a past life ? " " Honestly , I do n't know . I 'm sorry I ca n't be more help . I genuinely hope you find some answers to your questions someday . I think traveling there is a great idea . " Seeing the world never hurt , in my opinion . " Thanks for calling . " I had no idea where the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random . " Next caller , what do you want to talk about ? " " Hi , Kitty , yeah . Um , thanks . I-I think I have a problem . " He was male , with a tired-sounding tenor voice . I always listened closely to the ones who seemed tired ; their problems were usually doozies . " Then let 's see what we can do with it . What 's wrong ? " " It all started when these two guys moved to town , a werewolf and a vampire . They 're a couple , you know ? " " These are two guys . Men , right ? " " Right . " " And the problem is ... " " Well , nothing at this point . But then this vampire hunter started going after the vampire , I guess he 'd been hired by the vampire 's former human servant . " " The vampire 's human servant did n't travel with him ? " " No , he dumped her to run off with the werewolf . " There could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then what ? " " Another werewolf , who used to be the alpha female mate of the werewolf before he hooked up with the vampire , showed up . She wanted to get back together with him , saying this stuff about wolves mating for life and all , but he did n't want anything to do with her , so he hired the same hunter to go after her- " " This hunter , his name was n't Cormac by any chance , was it ? " I knew a vampire and werewolf hunting Cormac , and this sounded like something he might do . " No . " Phew . " Just checking . " The story only went downhill from there . Just when I thought the last knot had been tied in the tangled web of this town 's supernatural soap opera , the caller added a new one . Finally , I was able to ask , " And what 's your place in all this ? " He gave a massive sigh . " I 'm the human servant of the local vampire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them they have to leave town . ' ' Tell your Master we do n't want to leave town ! ' ' Tell the hunter we 'll pay him to call off the contract ! ' ' Tell him if he does n't come back to me I 'll kill myself ! ' It never ends ! And all I want to know is- " Maybe he just wanted to vent . That was what I was here for . Maybe he would n't ask me to sort out his drama for him . Fingers crossed . " Yes ? " " Why ca n't we all just get along ? " Oy . It was one of those nights . " That , my friend , is the million-dollar question . You know what ? Screw ' em . They 're all being selfish and putting you in the middle . Make them deliver their own messages . " " I-I ca n't do that . " " Yes you can . They 've got to realize how ridiculous this all looks . " " Well , I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what ? " " I guess I 'm used to doing what I 'm told . " " Then maybe you should learn to say no . When they act surprised that you 've said no , tell them it 's for their own good . You 've basically been enabling all their snotty behavior , right ? " " Maybe ... " " Because if they had to start talking to each other they might actually solve some of their problems , right ? " " Or rip each other 's throats out . They 're not exactly human , remember . " Taking a deep breath and trying not to sound chronically frustrated , I said , " I may very well be the only person in the supernatural underworld who feels this way , but I do n't think that should make a difference . Crappy behavior is still crappy behavior , and letting yourself succumb to unsavory monstrous instincts is n't a good excuse . So , stand up for yourself , okay ? " " O-okay , " he said , not sounding convinced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes . " " Thanks , Kitty . " The producer gave me a warning signal , waving from the other side of the booth window , pointing at his watch , and making a slicing motion across his throat . Um , maybe he was trying to tell me something . I sighed , then leaned up to the mike . " I 'm sorry , folks , but that looks like all the time we have this week . I want to thank you for spending the last couple of hours with me and invite you to come back next week , when I talk with the lead singer of the punk metal band Plague of Locusts , who says their bass player is possessed by a demon , and that 's the secret of their success . This is The Midnight Hour , and I 'm Kitty Norville , voice of the night . " The ON AIR sign dimmed , and the show 's closing credits , which included a recording of a wolf howl-my wolf howl-as a backdrop , played . I pulled the headset off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't look too squished . The producer 's name was Jim something . I forgot his last name . Rather , I did n't bother remembering . I 'd be at a different radio station next week , working with a different set of people . For the better part of a year , most of the show 's run , I 'd broadcast out of Denver . But a month ago , I left town . Or was chased out . It depended on who you talked to . Rather than find a new base of operations , I decided to travel . It kept me from getting into trouble with the locals , and it made me harder to find . The radio audience would n't know the difference . I was in Flagstaff this week . I leaned on the doorway leading to the control booth and smiled a thanks to Jim . Like a lot of guys stuck manning the control board over the graveyard shift , he was impossibly young , college age , maybe even an intern , or at most a junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He probably had n't expected to handle this many calls on a talk show that ran at midnight . Most of my audience stayed up late . He handed me a phone handset . I said into it , " Hi , Matt . " Matt had worked the board for the show when I was in Denver . These days , he coached the local crew . I could n't do this without him . " Hey , Kitty . It 's a wrap , looks like . " " Was it okay ? " " Sounded great . " " You always say that , " I said with a little bit of a whine . " What can I say ? You 're consistent . " " Thanks . I think . " " Tomorrow 's full moon , right ? You going to be okay ? " It was nice that he remembered , even nicer that he was worried about me , but I did n't like to talk about it . He was an outsider . " Yeah , I have a good place all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty . " " Thanks . " I wrapped things up at the station and went to my hotel to sleep off the rest of the night . Locked the door , hung out the DO NOT DISTURB sign . Could n't sleep , of course . I 'd become nocturnal , doing the show . I 'd gotten used to not sleeping until dawn , then waking at noon . It was even easier now that I was on my own . No one checked up on me , no one was meeting me for lunch . It was just me , the road , the show once a week . An isolated forest somewhere once a month . A lonely life . My next evening was spoken for . Full moon nights were always spoken for . I found the place a couple of days ago : a remote trailhead at the end of a dirt road in the interior of a state park . I could leave the car parked in a secluded turn-out behind a tree . Real wolves did n't get this far south , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werewolves who might have marked out this territory . I spent an afternoon walking around , watching , smelling . Giving the locals a chance to see me , let them know I was here . I did n't smell anything unexpected , just the usual forest scents of deer , fox , rabbits . Good hunting here . It looked like I 'd have it all to myself . A couple of hours from midnight , I parked the car at the far end of the trailhead , where it could n't be seen from the road . I did n't want to give any hint that I was out here . I did n't want anyone , especially not the police , to come snooping . I did n't want anyone I might hurt to come within miles of me . I 'd done this before . This was my second full moon night alone , as a rogue . The first time had been uneventful , except that I woke up hours before dawn , hours before I was ready , shivering in the cold and crying because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked in the middle of the woods . That never happened when I had other werewolves there to remind me . My stomach felt like ice . This was never going to get easier . I used to have a pack of my own . I 'd been surrounded by friends , people I could trust to protect me . A wolf was n't meant to run on her own . You 'll be okay . You can take care of yourself . I sat in the car , gripping the steering wheel , and squeezed shut my eyes to keep from crying . I had acquired a voice . It was an inner monologue , like a part of my conscience . It reassured me , told me I was n't crazy , admonished me when I was being silly , convinced me I was going to be okay when I started to doubt myself . The voice sounded like my best friend , T.J. He died protecting me , six weeks ago today . The alpha male of our pack killed him , and I had to leave Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to doubt , I heard T.J. 's voice telling me I was going to be okay . His death sat strangely with me . For the first week or two , I thought I was handling it pretty well . I was thinking straight and moving on . People call that stage denial . Then on the highway , I saw a couple on a motorcycle : neither of them wore helmets , her blond hair tangled in the wind , and she clung to his leather jacket . Just like I used to ride with T.J. The hole that he 'd left behind gaped open , and I had to pull off at the next exit because I was crying so hard . After that , I felt like a zombie . I went through the motions of a life that was n't mine . This new life I had acquired felt like it had been this way forever , and like it or not , I had to adapt . I used to have an apartment , a wolf pack , and a best friend . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keys in my jeans pocket , and walked away from the parking lot , away from the trail , and into the wild . The night was clear and sharp . Every touch of air , every scent , blazed clear . The moon , swollen , bursting with light , edged above the trees on the horizon . It touched me , I could feel the light brushing my skin . Gooseflesh rose on my arms . Inside , the creature thrashed . It made me feel both drunk and nauseous . I 'd think I was throwing up , but the Wolf would burst out of me instead .
