Chapter Three It 's 3:52 . Joe sees Benny waiting on the front steps of the Grill . " Get out of here , " Joe says to me . Benny 's making him nervous . I take my apron off , fold it into a square , and put it in my pocket . I open the door and stand on the top step . " Come on , " Benny says . He walks to the back of the Grill , where there 's a trash house and a few crummy picnic tables . I follow , dragging my feet . The very first time Benny came by to pick me up at the Grill , he stepped down from the steps , stopped , and stared at me . He just stared and smiled . " What ? " I asked . " What is it ? " " You . " That 's all he said . " You . " Like that was all he ever asked for  --  all he ever needed . Now Benny sits on a table that has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's go down to the river , " I suggest . I want to take his hand and pull him down the bank , through the tall grass . I want to sit underneath the rushing falls . " I ca n't , Jocelyn , " he says . " Why not ? " My voice is that of Evil Soap Opera Girl . Evil Girl pretends to be sweet and innocent while deviously luring Boy away from goodness . Viewers know that Evil Girl is a manipulative bitch . But Boy does n't figure it out . He wants to be lured . Not Benny , though . Not this time . " You know what will happen if we go down to the river . " I know . I know that if I draw lines on Benny 's fingers or pictures on his strong forearms , he 'll sigh . And he 'll pull me close , and he 'll listen , or at least pretend to listen to my reasoning about love while his fingers find the softer parts of my body . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we are only expressing our God-given feelings . But , Benny will say , the Church says it 's wrong . Father Warren says it 's wrong . I got ta listen to what The Man says . He 'll raise his eyes toward heaven as if I have just slithered up from the bowels of the earth and have no idea who " The Man " is . Truth is , I do n't know if what Benny and I do is wrong . I just know that it makes me feel wanted . Like someone is so very pleased that I am here on this earth . " I made a deal , Jocelyn . " Benny 's voice is far away . Another town . Another universe . He fingers the silver Saint Christopher 's medal around his neck , a medal for protection . Protection from me . " In church this morning I made a deal . " " For your mother ? " I ask . But I already know the answer . Benny swapped being with me for his mother 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with you , Joss . I think you 're fantastic . You  --  God , this is so hard . " " Then do n't do it , Benny . Do n't do this to us . " " I have no choice , Joss . " Benny puts his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands . And I have no answers . We tried being " just friends , " but it did n't keep . One of us makes a move toward the other , and it 's all over . I turn and head home . " Jocelyn . Come back ! " Benny follows for a ways . I know that he wants this to end well . I can feel him stop and stand in one place , hoping I 'll turn around so he can do something magnanimous , like kissing me on the forehead . Or touching me on the cheek . Somebody taught him sweet . I want to stop , I really do , but I ca n't bear to have him tell me good-bye . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't until the big white town houses with porch swings turn to cabins with multiple additions and hanging tires and the sidewalks bleed into gravel that I buckle over and gasp for air .
