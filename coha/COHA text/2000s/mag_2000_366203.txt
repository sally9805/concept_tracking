Jesus , if he were still around and had settled in Iowa , would be a very confused man when the caucuses roll around next week . Every time he opened his mailbox in the past month , he would have found come-ons from half a dozen presidential candidates who claim to know him . But as one man told me last week in the Mississippi River town of Bettendorf , " I do n't know how God can not let Steve Forbes win . He has to be a pretty good guy if God gave him $250 million . " <P> It is actually closer to $440 million , but why quibble ? The point is that Forbes , pretty much forgotten by the national media , has not gone away . He has been quietly pouring millions into Iowa , plotting to wipe that smirk off Republican front runner George W. Bush 's face . <P> Forbes knows there is no chance of beating Bush in Iowa , but the Hail Mary strategy is to finish a strong second , as Pat Buchanan did in 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pile on , whupping Bush in New Hampshire Feb. 1 . Then , goes the theory , people will ask what they ever saw in Bush anyway . And if this should happen , the man who could outspend all the candidates combined is  --  guess who ? <P> To find out whether this is a real possibility or the final act in a nationally televised mid-life crisis , I joined Forbes as he crisscrossed Iowa by plane and bus . And I must say  --  for the sake of getting it out of the way  --  that yes , he looks as if he just accidentally walked into a brick wall and was knocked goofy . The glasses and smile are akimbo , and the eyes are not right . But he is so obviously pained by this , and stuck with it , that I found a sympathetic quality in him . <P> The night we met , Forbes came to the back of his chartered Gulf Stream turboprop and asked me , of all people , the inside story on the AOL-Time Warner merger . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole mess , along with his advice on what to do with the stock , he said sell . " Nobody ever lost money taking a profit , " he said . Two days after I did n't take his advice , God punished me . The stock had dropped 25 points . <P> Over the next few days  --  in Sioux City , Mason City , Dubuque , Cedar Falls , Cedar Rapids , Muscatine and Washington  --  no fewer than 120 people attended each event to hear Forbes ' anti-Washington , pro-life gospel . In 1996 Forbes was a one-trick pony with the flat tax . Now he , Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes lead with morality . The Forbes people pray that one of those two does n't become this year 's Buchanan , whose 1996 campaign had Bible thumpers jumping out of their pews in the Hawkeye State , where a popular billboard reads GOD IS PRO-LIFE . ARE YOU ? <P> Depends on the year . In the last go-around and for most of his life , Forbes kept his religion privatized . If anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothy flake and saying that if a woman were raped , she had a right to an abortion . But when President Clinton put the hallelujah back in Republican politics , the Lord Jesus suddenly gave Steve Forbes the courage to testify for faith-based leadership . You 'd think such a swift conversion might backfire , but there 's little evidence of it in Iowa . Steve Scheffler , leader of the state 's Christian Coalition from 1991 to 1998 , campaigns for Forbes and claims true believers admire the candidate for putting God right up there with the flat tax .
