Here at BigHorn Ace Hardware , down the aisle from the wing nuts and behind the coils of rope and chain , Don Sather thinks he has a fix for the nation 's looming power crisis . <p> Sather 's solution is n't some gizmo buried deep in his store 's inventory of 25,000 tools and parts . <p> It 's the store itself . BigHorn Hardware is a cathedral to energy efficiency and conservation . <p> Mountain sunlight from an azure sky streams through slit windows that soar 35 feet overhead . Natural light bathes rows of sledgehammers , cleaning supplies and wheelbarrows like pews in the nave . Fans swirl a cool breeze through the hushed space . No Muzak , no neon , no talking displays . <p> The home improvement center , which stretches nearly the length of a city block , is pinned 9,000 feet high in the Rocky Mountains between the Continental Divide and the Eagles Nest Wilderness . Despite its unforgiving location , the store uses one-third less energy than a conventional building of similar size . Even in winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products already on the market . No NASA prototypes or Rube Goldberg contraptions allowed . They say the store 's performance could be reproduced almost any place where energy costs and demand are rising . <p> " Photovoltaics , extra insulation , efficiency windows , radiant heating in the floor . " Sather recites the store 's design features . <p> " If we 're not using all of our power , the meter runs backward and we sell it to the power grid , " he said . " With a little tweaking , we should reduce consumption by 62 percent . " <p> A year ago , America 's SUV culture would have dismissed Sather as an eccentric befuddled by thin mountain air . Renewable and alternative energy systems could never pay for themselves in a world glowing with cheap fossil fuels , right ? <p> Today , Sather is an emerging hero . California 's first planned blackouts since World War II and spiraling utility bills nationwide have alarmed Americans about something that previous generations took for granted - affordable , reliable power . <p> The cornerstone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gathers electricity from more than 3,000 generating stations and hurls it like thunderbolts along some 200,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines spreading like a spider web from the Pacific to the Atlantic . <p> Conventional power sources - oil , gas , coal and to a diminishing extent , nuclear - are supplemented these days by some renewable sources such as huge hydropower dams and a growing number of wind-powered propeller " farms . " <p> But increasingly , customers both large and small are turning to a variety of alternative technologies that use less power , or that generate their own electricity away from the grid in what 's known as " distributed generation . " <p> Cost once discouraged such talk . Grid power might be dirty and inefficient , but it was four to five times cheaper than , say , solar power . <p> Today , everybody 's talking about reliability and security . According to some estimates , 20 percent of new power sources by 2010 will be distributed , not centralized . <p> " In a crisis , are you better off than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo . <p> " Bad things happen inside a factory when the power goes out . Belts fray , machines jam , products are damaged . Ask a manager if he would be willing to pay four times more for power if you could guarantee him that your technology would n't fail him . " <p> New York City got the message . Fearing a summer power shortage , it is shoehorning 10 smaller generators into neighborhoods , bypassing aging transmission lines . They should yield 400 megawatts , or enough electricity to power 400,000 homes . <p> Smaller still are microturbines , which produce up to a megawatt apiece with very low emissions . At about $35,000 per unit , as many as 20 units can be clustered to provide off-grid power for individual businesses . <p> In Chicago , the Goose Island Beer Co. has purchased a " six-pack " of microturbines from Capstone Turbine Corp . Capstone shipped 242 microturbine systems in the fourth quarter of 2000 alone . <p> Why ? Since mid-December , the brewery and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackouts forced California dairies to hastily dump tons of milk in wastewater ponds . <p> Beer spoils , too . A blackout during a Cubs baseball game this summer might force Goose Island to dump entire batches of its Honker 's Pale Ale from its microbrewery near Wrigley Field . <p> " California has caused people to get off the fence and make decisions about their power future , " said Capstone vice president Mark Kuntz . <p> Another alternative power unit , the fuel cell , has been powering NASA spacecraft since the 1960s . On the ground , fuel cells have been difficult to mass-produce . <p> A fuel cell makes electricity in a chemical reaction like a battery , but does n't store it . <p> Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other . The hydrogen atoms split , and its electrons create a separate current before being reunited again . Its " exhaust " is water and heat . <p> Since 1999 , the First National Bank of Omaha has relied on a quartet of fuel cells to power its electronic banking center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour . <p> The system generates twice as much power as needed . In the winter , the bank uses its hot water to melt snow and heat the tunnels leading to parking lots . <p> Dennis Hughes , the bank 's property management director , fields fuel cell inquiries every day , especially from Silicon Valley . <p> " Telecommunications , financial services , data center operators , " Hughes said . " They all want to come to Omaha for the tour . " <p> But for most people , installing their own off-grid power source remains impractical and too expensive . <p> Many experts say the nation would save more energy faster if local users - schools , office parks , subdivisions - would add high-tech supplementary systems such that produce enough juice to avoid throwing the grid into crisis during demand peaks . <p> Better still , they recommend adopting simple , more efficient ways to use energy already being produced . <p> That means building new stores and homes to stricter standards and installing improved systems and appliances . In 1999 , the nation saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alliance to Save Energy , a Washington-based nonprofit . <p> ( A Btu , or British thermal unit , measures the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a pound of water one degree Fahrenheit . ) <p> " A Btu is a Btu , whether it comes from a coal-fired generating station or reducing energy use , " said David Hamilton , the alliance 's policy director . <p> " It has been hard for people to think of efficiency as a supply option , " Hamilton said . " Traditionally supply is something you burn , like a lump of coal or a barrel of oil . Few people recognize that if you displace a Btu and put it back into supply , it has the same energy . " <p> In Northern California , San Mateo County plans to close its five-story government center one day per week . Savings : $80,000 annually . <p> Better still , experts say , is to plan efficiencies into a building 's design so it remains open and productive . <p> That was Sather 's approach at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renewable Energy Laboratory . <p> BigHorn 's metal roof has integrated photovoltaic panels on the south side to directly convert intense mountain sunlight into electricity , much like a solar-powered handheld calculator . It yields 9 kilowatt hours of electricity , enough to cover 25 percent of the center 's power demand . <p> Windows reduce the use of compact fluorescent lamps to a few hours per day . <p> The energy lab 's computer models predicted the building 's performance and energy savings . <p> " Reduced lighting eliminated the need for air conditioning , " said the lab 's Torcellini . " You can start downsizing all the equipment . " <p> Perhaps the most innovative feature is BigHorn 's 22,000-square foot warehouse . Its south wall is made of brown metal to soak up the sun 's rays and heat a high-tech insulating film behind it . <p> Inside , fans collect the heat and blow 70-degree air through long fabric ducts . Workers stay warm even with the doors open and trucks driving in and out . <p> Sather remembers that his store is unique only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region 's gas and electricity provider . Otherwise it 's the hardware business - cut a pane of glass , shake a can of paint . <p> " I 've never had a complaint about the store being uncomfortable , " Sather said . <p> To experts like Torcellini , that 's a victory speech . <p> Retail consultants preach that a store 's environment must be exceptionally controlled so the public will concentrate on spending , not shivering . Brighter and warmer equals profit . <p> Ace Hardware even has nationwide rules about minimum light intensity 4 feet off the showroom floor - enough candlepower , say , to read the fine print on a box of rose food . <p> Yet nothing at BigHorn is hindering the great American pastime of shopping . <p> " You do n't have to live and work in the dark to be energy efficient , " Torcellini said . " You just have to plan . " <p> End Adv for Sunday , Feb. 18 , and thereafter <p>
