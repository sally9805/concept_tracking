1 We made a pact . Not for our men , but for ourselves , really . The five of us would buy a pole . A stripper 's pole  --  mirror-finished stainless steel , attached from floor to ceiling . It was approaching midnight , and we had already polished off two shakers of chocolate-banana martinis . Shaundra was on the couch . Me and Niecee sat on either side of the coffee table ; Brenda was on the love seat , half passed out after one drink , as usual . Karina was wide awake , with sweats on , legs positioned in an overextended V as she stretched her open palm toward her toes . The idea was Shaundra 's . Had anyone else come up with it , we would have laughed it off and moved on to the next thing . But Shaundra was grounded . She was n't nasty like Niecee , who was willing to try anything once , and she was n't scary like Brenda . She was our middle mark . We measured ourselves by her , usually without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too fat , too loud , too quiet , and too loose  --  all by Shaundra 's position in our crew . " I 'm gon na cut it off . Clean off , I swear , " Shaundra said . " Ohh , nooo . You 're in love , remember . He just treats you sooo wonderful and he 's sooo attentive . " Niecee smirked , stirred her electric-blue nail around the inside of her martini glass , then sucked her entire middle finger into her mouth . " Why are you always tryin'ta catch somebody with their ownwords ? " Niecee swirled her tongue around her finger one good time , then pointed it at Shaundra . " Do n't get mad at me because you were chasing his stank drawers last week . It ai n't my fault you luvs him . " Niecee smiled , then whipped her hard-pressed hair from her shoulder to her back . " Let her talk , Niecee , " I interjected . " Shay , why do n't you concentrate on taking those horsehair braids out of your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair again for good effect . Niecee was cute and she knew it  --  milk chocolate , in good shape , with her real hair cutting almost to the middle of her back . I continued unbraiding the middle of my head . " All I have to say is do n't fall asleep , cuz all your shit might be cut off when you wake up . " " That 's what I said , " Shaundra started up again . " I'ma cut his shit straight off . Let me find another stripper 's number in his pants . " " How do you know it 's a stripper 's number ? " Karina asked as she tucked her right leg into her overly thick thigh for another stretch . " She gave him a business card . " Shaundra reached across the coffee table into her purse . " That 's a shame . Even strippers have business cards nowadays . " I shook my head . " Maybe I should get some made up : Housewife seeks adventure  --  will pay you . " She handed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then to the front again . " Brit-ten-ney . The girl does n't even know how to spell , " Shaundra said . The card was glossy , printed on a nicely weighted cardstock . Brittenney  --  Petite Goddess was printed at the top left of the card , and a photograph of a light-skinned young woman with a long black weave and pouted lips was on the right . She had a deer-in-the-headlights , wide-eyed look on her face , her left hand draped the bare skin above her braless breast , and her nipples were cropped off the card by a black border . I passed the card to Karina . " ' Actress , Exotic Dancer , Escort , Private Parties . Call for rates . ' What does incall/outcall mean ? " Niecee took another sip of her drink . " It means his place or hers . " I shot Karina a look . She placed the card on the table . " Well , " she said , " it still does n't mean he 's into strippers . He could have gotten that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee table and adjusted her feet again under the purple afghan . " I know he 's into strippers , and I 'm tired of him telling me that the government is garnishing his check for child support . " " Well , Shaundra , that is n't so far-fetched , " I said , wanting to comfort her . She threw up her hands and rolled her eyes to the back of her head . " Are you sleeping with him too now ? " I rolled my eyes in rebuttal . " I 'm just saying , Shaun . " " I have seen his pay stub and talked to his ex-wife . " Shaundra pursed her lips . " He 's not getting garnished ; he 's giving his money to Cotton Candy and Honey Dip . " Niecee flicked her hair again . " You know you need the hickory stick as much as he needs the na-na . Stop complaining . " I grabbed a pile of unbraided hair from my hair bag and threw it at her . Sometimes I just wanted to strangle Niecee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not really . Brenda , Shaundra , Karina , and I were friends . Niecee was Shaundra 's older sister and roommate , so we tolerated her for those two reasons alone . " I may as well share this with y'all now . You 're gon na find out anyway . " Shaundra sat up straight , knocked the purple afghan from her lap , and smoothed her hands over her stretched-to-the-max size 13 blue denim jeans . " I 'm ordering a pole . " " You 're ordering a what ? " Brenda uncurled her five-foot-ten-inch body from the fetal position she had been in on the love seat . " I thought you were asleep , " I said . " You must be talking about a fishing pole , right ? " Karina asked , looking up from one of the three Travel &; Leisure magazines spread between her stretched legs . " She 's talking about a booty clap , **27;74;TOOLONG pole . " " Is that how much you used to charge , Niecee ? " " Ooohhhh ! " we all cooed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Shaundra and high-fived her , then held up my hand to Niecee for another high five . She left me hanging . " Please "  --  she flicked her hair  --  " I only did that for a week . And it was good money . " " I 'm ordering a stripper 's pole , " Shaundra confessed . " And I was thinking "  --  a devious grin spread on her lips  --  " maybe y'all want to go in with me . " " You ca n't be serious , " Karina said before I could get the words out . A part of me was thrilled . The other part felt like I had entered an alternate universe . This was different , even for us . " Well , I 'm in , " Brenda said matter-of-factly . " Just let me know how much and I 'll get you a check this week . " " Shaun , you 're really getting a stripper 's pole ? " I asked . " Why not ? I 'm a good woman . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to shake her behind and wrap her leg around a pole ? Way I see it , I need to join the game . " " Well , I 'm down , too , " Niecee said , " as long as I can pay you in weekly installments . " We all looked at her . " What ? " She sat up on her knees and poured the last of the martinis into her glass . " I 'm not balling like y'all . Twenty-five dollars a week is better than nothin ' . Besides , I could stand a little practice . " " Karina ? Shay ? " Shaundra looked at us both . " Are y'all in ? " Karina waved both of her hands above her head . " Nunh-uh , y'all . It 's taken me a year and a half to get down to my weight . I 'm not gon na mess around and risk a broken hip because I was swinging my fat butt on a pole . Besides , I 'd have to pray about it anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " Shay ? " I looked at Shaundra . " So I guess we 'd have it one week a month or something like that ? " " Whoop , whoop ! Okay , you 're in . " I had n't seen Shaundra this excited since she found out she was pregnant with Brandi . " We can each get the pole for one week , from Saturday to Saturday . I already picked one out . It 's stainless steel , splits in two pieces , and comes with its own carrying case . We wo n't even have to drill holes or anything . " " So , how much ? " Brenda leaned forward on the love seat . " Five hundred forty dollars and eleven cents . If we split it four ways , that 'll be a hundred and thirty-five apiece , a reasonable investment in our relational and sexual futures . " Shaundra ran her hand over her recently cropped hair . " It 's hardball time now . If Paul wants a stripper , from this point on , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sistah . ' Bout time you got some sense . " Everyone starred at Niecee again . She bucked her eyes . " That 's real . If a broad handles her own business , she ai n't got to worry about another heffa doing it for her . " She swept her tongue around the rim of her glass . Her words struck a chord of truth inside of me . " This is a trip . We are really going to do this stripper-pole time-share thing . I would have never believed it . " " Does it come with an instructional tape ? " Brenda asked in her most intellectual voice . Niecee jumped in . " What are you gon na learn from a tape ? You have to get this experience the natural way , at a strip club . You pick it up as it comes . And that 's easier for some of us than it is for others . " She smirked at Brenda , her right dimple deepening to its fullest . Brenda was never very rhythmic ; that had n't changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on if you really wanted to . Do n't even listen to Niecee . Besides "  --  Shaundra let her own right dimple deepen  --  " I 'm going down to the club this Saturday . If y'all want to come , you 're welcome to roll . " " I 'll ride , " Niecee said . " I might run into one of my old girls . " " I 'm down , too , " Brenda said , ignoring Niecee 's chuckle . Karina rolled her ankles to finish off her stretching and closed her magazine . " I 'm gon na have to talk to the Man Upstairs about this , but I think y'all are gon na need a prayer warrior in the house , so tentatively count me in . " I was the only one left . I wanted to go , but I knew Mark was going to flip out more about the club than he would about the pole or me having an occasional drink with my crew now and then . " Y'all my girls , but I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I might be pushing it . " " Why do n't you just spit the truth , Shoshannah . " Niecee winked at me and it irked the hell out of me . " You'se got to ask Minister Mark . And Lord knows , Minister Mark do n't want his wife hanging out in no den of sin . Heavens no . " " Leave her alone , Niecee . Ai n't nothing wrong with trying to be a good Christian wife . Shay ai n't got nothing to be ashamed of . " Karina gave me a glance of approval . Niecee rolled her eyes . " Good Christian what ? Please . Y'all can live in la-la land if you want to , but she 's probably the biggest sinner of all of us . The innocent-looking ones are always the worst k  --  " " You need to worry about yourself . We all know hell 's got a special spot waiting for your scandalous butt , " Brenda said , still mad about the insinuation that she did n't have rhythm . Niecee giggled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a whole wing waiting for my ass , ' cause I do n't half-do nothin ' . " I grabbed my week-old blush Shiseido glasses from the table , then collected the stray extensions from my lap and most of the ones I had thrown at Niecee . Cautiously , I lifted myself up from the ground , feeling the slightest bit tipsy . " Shaundra , I 'm gon na head home , but do n't worry , I 've got your back Saturday night . "
