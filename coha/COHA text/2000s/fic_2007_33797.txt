I was in the pumpkin patch , counting the ones that were good enough for Old Pepper Apron , our cook , to make into bread . I recollect that Pa was happy that he 'd gotten one or two cents more on the pound from the cotton Granville had shipped out of Bagdad . And that the fields were being sown with winter oats and rye . I looked up and saw Sis Goose standing by the gate , a frown on her lovely face . It was all like some Dutch still life I was learning about from my tutor . Sis twisted her apron in her hands . She always wore a snow-white apron , like I did , even though we had no real household chores . " Luli , there 's an old negro man in our barn , " she said . For a moment I did not understand . The place was full of negro men : field hands , household help . But the look on her face told me something was amiss . " Who is he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " and her voice broke . " Sayswhat ? " " Says the negroes are free . That Abraham Lincoln freed them in January of ' 63 . " That rumor again . But with the war there was a different rumor every week . I swallowed . Something on Sis Goose 's face bespoke her distress . " Go and get Gabe , " I told her . " He 'll know what to do . " Gabe was in the house , helping Mama decide whether the one hundred bushels of corn she wanted to trade for three pounds of sugar was worth it . I went to the horse barn , but I did n't go in until Gabe and Sis Goose came back . " Where 'd you come from , Uncle ? " Gabe asked the man , who looked old enough to be somebody 's grandfather . " Virginny . I comes from Virginny , " came the answer . " From Applegate I come . On the advice of Miz Heather . " Applegate was my Virginia grandmother 's plantation . Gabe scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mule . It had usa branded on its back . " This is a fine-looking animal . Where 'd you get it ? " " Miz Heather give it to me . And say to come here . She give me a message for y'all . " " What message ? " from Gabe . " She say that no matter what , I shud tell y'all that Mister Linkum done freed the slaves nigh over a year ago now . " " Did she now ? " Gabe 's voice was tight , forced in its casualness . " Well , to my knowledge my grandmother never had a mule with usa branded on its back . This mule is government property , " Gabe told him . " I came from Virginny , " the old man insisted . " Miz Heather , she tell me . . . " " Yes , yes , I know , that Mr. Lincoln freed the slaves . I 'll tell you what , Uncle- " Then Gabe stopped and looked at us . " Go on into the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I 'll handle it . " We obeyed . I said nothing to Sis Goose about it . But she did to me . " Do you think he 's right ? " she asked . " I do n't know . I mean , we would have heard . If not us , then Gabe or Granville . I 'm sure we would have heard . " And so I lied to my best friend , my sister , who trusted me . Because I had heard of this before . But both Gabe and Granville had ordered me not to speak of it . The slaves free ! I could not think on it all at once . It assaulted my spirit . It gave lie to everything I knew in my life . All Pa 's people in the fields could put down their hoes and walk off if they wanted to . We 'd never have another corn or cotton crop . The sweet potatoes and white potatoes and vegetables needing dirt banks to keep them safe from the winter would all be ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one to repair the fences , see to the livestock . In the house , no one to keep Mama 's Chippendale furniture free of dust or polish the silver or make the beds . Who would do the laundry ? My mind gave way to hopelessness . And then I remembered what Granville had said the last time a man came to the barn like this . In June of ' 63 , it had been , right before Gettysburg . " You breathe a word of this and you 'll start bloodshed in Texas , " he warned me . Granville liked to make dramatic statements like that . " I could be free . " Sis Goose stopped walking and looked at me . The news had come over her the same way . " And what would you do ? " I asked casually . She lowered her eyes . Then looked at me almost flirtatiously . " I 'd marry Gabe . " No , I could n't take this , too . I drew in my breath . I 'd noticed of late the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . How he gave her the best cuts of meat . How he held out her chair . Was he just being a Southern gentleman ? He did n't do all that for me . With me he was brusque , moody . Gentle but sealed off . Fool , I told myself . You should have seen it . " Has he asked you ? " I pushed . " Yes . But I ca n't , unless I 'm free . I told him yes , at the end of the war . He wants to marry now . Because he says then Aunt Sophie ca n't sell me . I 'd be his wife . But I do n't want to be like my mama , the colored wench of a white man . " She spoke fast . And I thought fast . I entered into a covenant with myself then , a promise to lie , even if it killed me . " Well , it 's just a rumor . I 'm sorry , Sis Goose . My brothers and my pa would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd never lie to me , " she said . " Remember , we 're sisters .
