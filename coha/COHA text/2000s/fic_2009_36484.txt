WHEN Duncan Pennethorne , Earl of Sheringford , returned to London after a five-year absence , he did not go immediately to Claverbrook House on Grosvenor Square , but instead took up a reluctant residence on Curzon Street with his mother , Lady Carling . Sir Graham , hersecond husband , was not delighted to see him , but he was fond of his wife so did not turn his stepson from his doors . <br> Claverbrook House was where Duncan must go sooner rather than later , though . His funds had been cut off , without warning and without explanation , at just a time when he was preparing to return home at last-home being Woodbine Park in Warwickshire , the house and estate where he had grown up and that had provided him with a comfortable income since his father 's death fifteen years ago . <br> And he had not been going there alone . The Harrises , who had been in his employ for the past five years in various capacities , were going with him-the position of head gardener had fallen vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , four-year-old Toby was going there too . He was to be known at Woodbine as the Harrises ' orphaned grandson . Toby had been wildly excited when told that he would be living henceforward at the place about which Duncan had told him so many excitingstories-Duncan 's memories of his boyhood there were almost exclusively happy ones . <br> But then , suddenly , all his plans had gone awry , and he had been forced to leave the child with the Harrises in Harrogate while he dashed off to London in the hope of averting disaster . <br> His only warning had come in a formal note written in the bold hand of his grandfather 's secretary , though his grandfather 's signature was scrawled at the foot of the page , unmistakable despite the fact that it had grown shaky and spidery with age . At the same time the steward at Woodbine Park had grown suddenly and ominously silent . <br> They had all known where to write to him , much of the need for secrecy having been lifted with Laura 's death . Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unhappy event . <br> It made little sense to Duncan that his grandfather would decide to cut him off just when a measure of respectability had been restored to his life . It made even less sense when he considered the fact that as the Marquess of Claverbrook 's only grandson and only direct descendant , he was his heir . <br> But sense or nonsense , he was cut off , turned loose and penniless , with no means of supporting those who were dependent upon him-or himself for that matter . Not that he worried unduly about the Harrises . Good servants were always in demand . Or about himself . He was still young and able-bodied . But he did worry about Toby . How could he not ? <br> Hence this desperate dash to London , which was perhaps the last place on earth he wanted to be-and in the middle of the Season , to boot . It had seemed the only course of action open to him.The letter he had written in reply to his grandfather 's had been ignored , and already precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to demand an explanation in person . Or to ask for it , anyway . One did not demand anything of the Marquess of Claverbrook , who had never been known for the sweetness of his temper . <br> Duncan 's mother did not have any reassurance to offer . She had not even known he had been cut off until he told her so . <br> " I only wonder , " she said when he went to her boudoir the morning after his arrival-or the early afternoon to be more precise , since mornings did not figure largely in her favorite times of the day- " that he did not cut you off five years ago , my love , if he was going to do it at all . We allexpected that he would then . I was even toying with the idea of going to plead with him not to , but it struck me that by doing so I would quite possibly goad him into cutting you off even sooner than he planned . Perhaps he forgot until recently that you were still drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hetty-you will pull out every hair on my head and whatever will I do then ? " <br> Her maid was vigorously brushing the tangles out of her hair . <br> But his grandfather was not renowned for a poor memory either , especially where money was concerned . <br> " Graham says he will not support your excesses for longer than a week at the outside , " his mother added , returning her attention to her son as she arranged the flowing folds of her peignoir to show her figure to best advantage . " He told me so last evening after you arrived . But I would not worry about that , my love . I can wind Graham about my little finger whenever I choose . " <br> " You need not do it on my account , Mama , " Duncan assured her . " I will not be staying here for long , only until I have spoken with Grandpapa and settled something with him . He can not intend to leave me quite out in the cold , can he ? " <br> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had , in fact . And it seemed his mother agreed with him . <br> " I would not wager more than ten guineas or so against it , " she said , reaching for the rouge pot . " He is a stubborn , crotchety old man , and I am more than delighted that he is no longer my father-in-law and I do not have to pretend to dote upon him . Do hand me that rouge brush , if you please , my love . No , not that one-the other . Hetty , have I not told you repeatedly to set my things down so that they are within my reach while you are busy with my hair ? You must believe that my arms are long enough to reach my ankles . How peculiar that would be . " <br> Duncan left the room after handing his mother the correct rouge brush . He could not decide between turning up unannounced at Claverbrook House on the one hand and writing to request an audience on the other-for that was what a familial visit to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have to suffer the ignominy of being turned away by his grandfather 's Friday-faced butler-if Forbes still held the post , that was . He must be nearly as ancient as his master . If he wrote , on the other hand , his letter might yellow with age before his grandfather 's secretary deigned to give it any attention . <br> The pot or the kettle . <br> The devil or the deep blue sea . <br> Which was it to be ? <br> And there was a degree of urgency to the situation that threatened to throw Duncan into a panic . He had settled the Harrises and Toby in a couple of cramped rooms in Harrogate and paid one month 's rent . There was simply not enough money for another month . And one week of this one was gone already . <br> Even so , he procrastinated instead of making a decision and spent one whole day reacquainting himself with London-and London with him . Much as one set of instincts warned him to lie low , to avoid being seen if he possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not avoid the company of his peers for all of the rest of his life without becoming a hermit , he might as well sally forth now with all the nonchalance he could muster . <br> He went to White 's Club , where he still had a membership and where he did not find the doors barred against him . He met a number of former friends and acquaintances there , none of whom gave him the cut direct . On the contrary , a number of them hailed him with jovial familiarity , as if he had been there just last year or even last week and had never in his life dashed away from London and from society under a huge cloud of scandal . And if a few gentlemen ignored him , well , there was nothing so very unusual about that . One did not hail everyone one met , after all , at White 's or anywhere else . Nobody made a scene and demanded that he be removed from the hallowed sanctum of the club . <br> He allowed himself to be borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look over the horses , and then on to the races . He even acquired some modest winnings at the latter by the end of the afternoon , though they were far too modest to make any significant difference to his financial circumstances . In the evening he went to a card party , where he lost the afternoon 's windfall before winning more than half of it back again . <br> He packaged up the money before going to bed and dispatched it the next morning to Harrogate . By now Toby was bound to have put his heel through a stocking or his knee through his breeches or his toe through his shoes or . . . Well , the possibilities were endless . Bringing up a child was a decidedly expensive undertaking . <br> On the second day the ticklish decision of how best to approach his grandfather was taken out of his hands . There was a note beside his plate at the breakfast table , written in the all-too-familiar hand of the secretary . It was a summons to appear before the Marquess of Claverbrook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out much these days , according to Duncan 's mother , but obviously he did not miss much of what went on beyond his doors . He had heard that his grandson was back in town . He had even known where to find him . <br> And it was definitely a summons rather than aninvitation-at one o'clock precisely . <br> Duncan dressed with care in a coat of blue superfine that was neat and elegant but not in the first stare of fashion . He had his valet tie his neckcloth in a smart yet simple knot . He wore a plain fob at his waist and pulled on well-polished Hessian boots over his gray pantaloons , but plain black ones rather than anything more flamboyant . He certainly did not want to give the impression that he lived extravagantly-which he did not . <br> " You do understand , Smith , " he said to his man , " that I will be unable to pay you this week and perhaps will not be able to next week either-or the week after . You may wish to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best place to do it . " <br> Smith , who had remained with him through thick and thin for eleven years-though never before in utter poverty-sniffed . <br> " I understand a great deal , m'lord , " he said , " not having been born an imbecile . I will leave when I am good and ready to leave . " <br> Which would not be immediately , Duncan gathered-a loyalty for which he was silently grateful . <br> He frowned at his image before leaving the room . He did not want to appear obsequious before his grandfather any more than he wished to look expensive , though of course he was desperate . He sighed inwardly , took his hat and cane from Smith 's hands , and left the room and the house . <br> Forbes took Duncan 's things when he arrived at Claverbrook House , scarcely sparing him a glance as he did so , and invited his lordship to follow him . Duncan followed , raising his eyebrows and pursing his lips at the butler 's stiff back . It was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He doubted he would have got past Forbes unless he had been prepared to wrestle him to the ground . <br> The Marquess of Claverbrook was in the drawing room , seated in a high-backed chair he had possessed forever , close to a roaring fire despite the fact that it was a warmish spring day . Heavy velvet curtains were half drawn across the windows to block most of the sunlight . The air was heavy with the smell of the ointment he used for his rheumatism . <br> Duncan made his bow . <br> " Sir , " he said , " how do you do ? I hope I find you well . " <br> His grandfather , who had never been one to indulge in unnecessary chitchat , did not deign to deliver a health report . Neither did he greet his grandson or express any pleasure at seeing him again after so long . Nor did he demand to know why he was back in London when he had fled from it five years ago under the blackest cloud of scandal and disgrace . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed . <br> " Give me one good reason , " he said , his bushy white eyebrows almost meeting over the bridge of his nose , a sharply defined frown line between his brows the only feature that revealed where one ended and the other began , " just one , Sheringford , why I should continue to fund your excesses and debaucheries . " <br> He held a silver-headed wooden cane in both gnarled hands and thumped it on the floor between his feet to give emphasis to his displeasure . <br> There was one perfectly good reason-even apart from the fact that really there had not been a great many of either excesses or debaucheries . But his grandfather knew nothing about Toby and never would , if Duncan had any say in the matter . Nor would anyone else . <br> " Because I am your only grandson , sir ? " Duncan suggested . And lest that not be sufficient reason , as doubtless it was not , " And because I plan to live respectably for the rest of my life now that Laura is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . She had taken a winter chill and just faded away-because , in Duncan 's opinion , she had lost the will to live . <br> His grandfather 's frown deepened , if that were possible , and he thumped the cane again . <br> " You dare mention that name in my hearing ? " he asked rhetorically . " Mrs. Turner was dead to the world five years ago , Sheringford , when she chose to commit the unspeakable atrocity of running off with you , leaving her lawful husband behind . " <br> It had happened on Duncan 's twenty-fifth birthday-and , more to the point , on his wedding day . He hadabandoned his bride , virtually at the altar , and run away with her sister-in-law , her brother 's wife . Laura . The whole thing had been one of the most spectacular scandals London had seen in years , perhaps ever . At least , he assumed it had . He had not been here to experience it in person . <br> He said nothing since this was hardly the time or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocity . <br> " I ought to have turned you out then without a penny , " his grandfather told him . He had not been invited to sit down , Duncan noticed . " But I allowed you to continue drawing on the rents and income of Woodbine Park so that you would have the wherewithal to stay far away out of my sight-and out of the sight of all decent , respectable people . But now the woman is gone , unmourned , and you may go to the devil for all I care . You promised solemnly on my seventieth birthday that you would marry by your thirtieth and have a son in your nursery before your thirty-first . You abandoned Miss Turner at the altar five years ago , and you turned thirty six weeks ago . " <br> Had he promised something so rash ? Of course , he would have been a mere puppy at the time . Was this the explanation for the sudden cutting off of his funds ? That his thirtieth birthday had come and gone and he was still a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , for the love of God . But not married to her , of course . Turner had steadfastly refused to divorce her . His grandfather had expected him to find a bride within the past four months , then , and marry her just to honor a promise made many years ago-by a boy who knew nothing of life ? <br> " There is still time to produce an heir before my thirty-first birthday , " he pointed out-a rather asinine thing to say , as his grandfather 's reaction demonstrated . He snorted . It was not a pleasant sound . <br> " Besides , " Duncan continued , " I believe you must have misremembered the promise I made , sir . I seem to recall promising that I would marry before your eightieth birthday . " <br> Which was . . . when ? Next year ? The year after ? <br> " Which happens to be sixteen days from now , " his grandfather said with brows of thunder again . " <br> Where is your bride , Sheringford ? " <br> Sixteen days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window in order to delay his answer , and stood looking down on the square , his hands clasped at his back . Could he pretend now that it was the eighty-fifth birthday he had named ? He could not even remember the promise , for God 's sake . And his grandfather might be making all this up just to discomfit him , just to give himself a valid excuse for cutting off his grandson from all funds . Woodbine Park , though a property belonging to the Marquess of Claverbrook , was traditionally granted to the heir as his home and main source of income . Duncan had always considered it his , by right of the fact that he was the heir after his father 's death , even though he had not lived there for years . He had never taken Laura there . <br> " No answer , " the marquess said after a lengthy silence , a nasty sneer in his voice . " I produced one son , who died at the age of forty-four when he had no more sense than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponent on a sharp bend in the road . And that one son produced one son of his own . You . " <br> It did not sound like a compliment . <br> " He did , sir , " Duncan agreed . What else was there to say ? <br> " Where did I go wrong ? " his grandfather asked irritably and rhetorically . " My brother produced five lusty sons before he produced any of his daughters , and those five in their turn produced eleven lusty sons of their own , at least two each . And some of them have produced sons . " <br> " And so , sir , " Duncan said , seeing where this was leading , " there is no danger of the title falling into abeyance anytime soon , is there ? There is no urgent hurry for me to get a son . " <br> It was the wrong thing to say-though there probably was no right thing . <br> The cane thumped the floor again . <br> " I daresay the title will pass to Norman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my time and after yours , which will not last even as long as your father 's if you continue with the low life you have chosen . I intend to treat him as though he were already my heir . I will grant him Woodbine Park on my eightieth birthday . " <br> Duncan 's back stiffened as if someone had delivered him a physical blow . He closed his eyes briefly . This was the final straw . It was bad enough-nothing short of a disaster , in fact-that Woodbine and its rents were being withheld from him . But to think of Cousin Norman , of all people , benefiting from his loss . . . Well , it was a viciously low blow . <br> " Norman has a wife and two sons , " the marquess told <br> Continues ...
