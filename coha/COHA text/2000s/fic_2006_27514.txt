Wind rapped against the bedroom window . Ivan Korske stared beyond his reflection , into the shadowy woods that surrounded the family 's farmhouse . November , and its chilly prelude to winter , had long arrived . Ivan stretched a thermal shirt over his back , then pulled long johns up his thighs . A plastic rubber-suit top that crinkled when he slipped it over his head came next . Sweatpants and a sweatshirt followed . Downstairs , a grandfather clock chimed eleven . Ivan vaguely noticed , grabbing a pair of weathered running shoes on the floor of his closet . While most Lennings High School seniors spent Sunday night on the phone , piecing together memories of the weekend 's parties , Ivan prepared for his evening run . Every night , regardless of how tired or hungry he was , Ivan ran . When his running shoes were soaked from rain , he ran . When his fingers were numb from the cold , he ran . The night his mother died last April , he ran . The final judgment of his high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jadwin Gymnasium , site of the New Jersey State Championships , the second Saturday of March . Each run , Ivan was certain , brought him that much closer to the dream of being a state champ and a chance to get away-far away-from Lennings . Anything less would befailure . Ivan sat at the end of his bed in the sparsely furnished room , dog tired from an afternoon of splitting logs behind the shed out back . There was a dresser and bookshelf , a wooden chair to his left , and the red and white of a small Polish flag coloring one of four otherwise bare walls . Ivan leaned over to tie the laces of his running shoes , then looked up at the photograph of his mother as a teenager in the old country-a sturdy young woman with soft , rounded cheeks and bright hazel eyes . Ivan was proud to have the same . The silver frame glinted from his meticulous care , even under the dim light of the bedroom lamp . Ivan imagined his mother sitting beside him , as she often had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chores for you , " she would say . " Your father forgets you are only seventeen . I will speak with him . I know you have other interests ... " She would smile and give a knowing nod toward the house across the street . " Even besides this wrestling sport . " Alone , in the chill of his bedroom , Ivan closed his eyes . He could hear her words , soothing and familiar , and see her face , robust and healthy , as they once were . He remained that way for some time . " Ivan . " His father 's voice bellowed from the first floor . " Are you running now ? " Ivan held back the sadness and hardened his face with unflinching resolve , the same glare he gave opponents before a match . " I 'm going . " " Now ? " " Yeah , Papa , now .

It was a clear night . A crescent moon hung just above the tree line . Ivan looked across the street at the Petersons ' house . In a second-floor corner window , he saw Shelley 's silhouette , head propped on an elbow , at her desk . Finishing her homework , he knew . Ivan breathed in deeply . Cold wind pressed against his body and slipped beneath his clothing . He felt alive , intensely aware of every inch of his skin , nostrils , and the full expansion of his lungs . This is gon na be a good run . With a shiver , Ivan started down Farmingdale Road . His running shoes bounced off the pavement edged by fields of withered grass , beyond which miles of woodlands passed in darkness . Ivan traveled back in time , as he did during every evening run . ... Lennings ' first freshman varsity starter-108-pound weight class . Going against the captain from Westfield-fourth in the state the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always spelling my name wrong ... Scared to death in the locker room before the match ... Forgetting what to do for the fifty-four seconds it took the guy to toss me all over the mat . Struggling to get off my back , while he squeezed the half . So tight my lungs could n't expand . Ca n't breathe ! Ca n't breathe ! Panic scrambling my head until , the nightmare ... I gave up ... Quit ... Never again ... To Ivan 's right , Sycamore Creek snaked its way through the woods before emptying into a pond , a stone 's throw wide , where he and the Scott broth played ice hockey as kids . Six years ago , the township 's new irrigation system began siphoning off water for a nearby corn farm , leaving the pond a bed of damp silt . Not that it mattered to Ivan . Shortly after , the Scotts moved away . He never heard from them again . No letters or postcards , no phone calls . They were just gone .

Quarterfinals of the states-122 pounds . Whipped by some guy from Newton . Hit a switch , and hit it hard . But the guy steps across and catches me . On my back . Fighting to get out . Then finally do . I score a reversal , later a takedown , but nothing else . Time runs out . The humiliation of getting beat 11-4 . Walking off the mat , the crowd staring at me like I 'm some loser . No escape . Freezing-cold nights running . Drilling moves for hours and hours and hours . Thousands of push-ups . Thousands of sit-ups . But I lost ... Losing tastes like crap ... Passing Wellington Farms , Ivan counted 564 steps along the length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had logged so many miles on this road , he could run , eyes closed , and avoid all the potholes and broken pavement . Sweat coated his body , while heat trapped within the layers of his clothing insulated him from the cold . Ahead , a row of street la Street . The center of town was desolate . Ivan passed Mr. Johnston 's Florist Shop , a fixture in town for decades ; Burley 's Automotive ; and the Starlite Deli . In the deli 's front window a poster read : IVAN-BRING HOME THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP ! A little farther , Ivan passed Hometown Hardware , then , at the corner , a neon sign blinked above Evergreen Tavern . The gravel parking lot was nearly full . Drinking away the last hours before another dreary week of life began , Ivan figured . He crossed the intersection , and soon , the center of Lennings was behind him .
