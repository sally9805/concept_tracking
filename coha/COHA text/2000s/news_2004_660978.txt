<p> Few were happier than Ayatollah Imad al-Deen Awadi when Saddam Hussein was deposed . " This was a man so bad that people said they 'd rather be ruled by Satan - the king of hell himself , " says the cleric , who spent 10 years in Mr. Hussein 's prisons . <p> But now Ayatollah Awadi worries that vicious fighting between US Marines and local insurgents in the Sunni triangle city of Fallujah is likely to spread across the country . " This is no longer about Fallujah , " he says . " If they are n't ready for peace , it will spread and be just as hot in Ramadi , Abu Ghraib , the southern provinces , the whole country , really . " <p> Indeed , Iraqi leaders and foreign analysts say the fighting in Fallujah , which has claimed around 700 Iraqi lives and has turned the muddled center of Iraqi public opinion - where people were ambivalent about the occupation but not actively opposed - decisively against the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority and its local allies . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no middle ground any more , " says an adviser to the CPA . " Two weeks ago Iraqis wanted to see us make promises and deliver on them - rebuild , improve - but then they saw pictures of US bombs falling on a mosque in Fallujah . Now they want us out . " <p> Haider Adil Al-Khafaji is a typical example of the hopeful Iraqis the US is losing amid the violence of April . <p> He was one of millions who poured into the streets when Saddam fell last April , and recalls jumping for joy when he caught the first sight of US armor rolling into Baghdad . " I swear to Allah I was happy that they got rid of this man . I was thinking they 'd develop Iraq , make it a better country . " <p> The mood shifts <p> But he recalls that his growing uneasiness with the US occupation turned into something steelier a few weeks ago , when he saw the first images of civilian casualties carried from Fallujah on the Arab satellite channels Al Jazeera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are . " <p> The Governing Council looks to many Iraqis to now be a spent force , its credibility badly damaged by perceived close ties to the Americans . " I 'm sorry to say the Governing Council is now very week and their role limited , " says Awadi . <p> " I would n't say they 're not good . But no one is listening to them anymore . They 're turning to religious figures that they trust . " <p> Compared to a week ago , violence in Iraq is in a lull . Fighting that had erupted in Fallujah , where four American security consultants were murdered , has calmed down somewhat after a temporary cease-fire was put in place . <p> And the Shiite uprising in cities further south , led by followers of Moqtada al-Sadr , has also quieted down . US officials and members of the Iraqi Governing Council say there 's still hope these two fronts could be brought under control by peaceful means . <p> Wednesday , about 2,500 US forces remained in place outside the key Shiite holy city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his militia have been holed up for the past week . US forces have remained on hold outside the city for fear of what could happen across the country if shots are fired there . <p> " Look at this as the Shiite Vatican , " Col. Dana J.H. Pittard , in command of US forces in Najaf , told the Associated Press Tuesday . He said US troops know that firing " a single shot " inside Najaf could inflame broader Shiite resentment . <p> But rhetoric from both sides is as incendiary as ever , with residents of Fallujah and supporters of Sadr alleging human rights abuses by US troops , while Marine press releases dismiss opponents in Fallujah as " terrorists . " <p> In fact , they believe it is possible that Al Qaeda 's Abu Musab Zarqawi may be in the city . <p> President George Bush , in a rare live news conference on Tuesday , characterized violence in Iraq as akin to terrorist attacks on US interests stretching back 20 years - when a suicide bomb blasted marine barracks in Beirut , killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , we 've seen that any concession or retreat on our part will only embolden this enemy and invite more bloodshed , " President Bush said . <p> " No one can predict all the hazards that lie ahead or the cost that they will bring . Yet , in this conflict , there is no safe alternative to resolute action . " <p> Last-minute efforts <p> To be sure , there are behind the scenes negotiations . Preachers like Awadi have been working every backchannel they know to insurgents and US administrators . <p> Members of the Governing Council have traveled to Fallujah to mediate , and the shaky cease-fire there was extended for another 24 hours by the US Wednesday . <p> The US has been hoping that Grand Ayatollah Ali Al Sistani , probably the country 's most respected cleric , will serve as a mediator to the Sadr standoff and convince his men to stand down . <p> Aids to Sadr said Wednesday that they 've made proposals to the US to solve the crisis , but the content of those proposals are not yet clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Najaf Wednesday that Sadr is willing to drop conditions he had set for meeting with mediators - most importantly a demand that US troops immediately move away from Iraq - and that he will accept what top Shiite leaders led by Sistani recommend . <p> While that looks like a key concession , it 's not clear if Sistani will deliver what the US wants . Imam Jawad al-Khalasi , a Shiite cleric close to Sistani , says the cleric has told him that he 's opposed to the arrest of Sadr , but that he 's also opposed to more violence by Sadr 's men . <p> " The only options are to lift the encirclement of Fallujah , to pull troops out from around Najaf , and to cancel the arrest warrant for Sadr , " says Mr. Khalasi . " Otherwise the occupation will continue down this road . " <p> Khalasi spoke after a meeting between Sunni and Shiite clerics at Baghdad 's Abu Hanifa mosque in the Sunni Adhamiya district , the main collection point for emergency medical and food aid being sent to Fallujah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosque was a symbol of the split between Iraq 's majority Shiites and minority Sunnis , who for over 100 years have held domestic political power . Hussein made his last public appearance outside the mosque , and when the US moved into the area , it was the sight of ferocious gun battles between Iraqis and US forces , with a tank taking out the mosque 's main minaret . <p> At the same time , just across the river in the Shiite Khadimiya district , residents danced in the streets and scrawled graffiti denouncing Hussein . Today , it 's a symbol of an unexpected alliance being forged between the two groups by their shared enmity for the US . " What happened in Fallujah made every Iraqi think that the same could happen to their town , and it united us , " says Khalasi . <p> The Marines and coalition officials say they doubt many civilians have been killed in Fallujah and promise that their rules of engagement limit civilian casualties . " My solution is change the channel , " Brig . Gen. Mark Kimmitt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dead Iraqi civilians . <p> " The stations that are showing Americans intentionally killing women and children are not legitimate news sources , that is propaganda , and that is lies . " <p> While the fog of battle makes it difficult to get to the bottom of their differing accounts , the political impact of the television images and of what most Iraqis deeply believe ca n't be denied . <p> " You ca n't remove the picture of graves from the soccer field in Fallujah , " says the CPA adviser . " But we can trying to start shifting the environment in a positive direction by focusing on economic improvements that might win people over . " <p> Awadi says he 's not entirely without hope . He acknowledges the uncompromising rhetoric from both sides , but says he has faith that big compromises will be made , particularly by the US , in the interest of peace . <p> " Do n't believe what they say , " he says . " Inside of me , I feel they 'll make compromises , and my insides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
