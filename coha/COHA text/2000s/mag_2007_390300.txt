Catch more bass by interpreting and perfecting your hook placement . For knowledgeable anglers , pattern fishing does n't end when a bass is hooked and pulled into the boat . In fact , that 's the time to fine-tune a pattern . The definition of " pattern , " as first noted by tournament great Roland Martin back in the early 1970s , is the exact set of water and cover conditions  --  clarity , depth , temperature , proximity to structure , wind direction and barometric pressure  --  that attract fish to a certain spot and other similar spots all over the lake . What most fishermen do n't realize , however , is that the way in which a bass takes the lure  --  particularly the hook placement  --  can provide clues to further perfecting a pattern and catching more fish . " You can really refine your pattern based on how a bass is hooked , " says Skeet Reese , a top performer on the Bassmaster Elite Series . " Hook placement in a fish 's mouth or body tells you a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your presentation . " REACTION LURES A lot depends on which types of bait you 're fishing : slow-moving , bottom-bouncing baits , such as jigs or worms ; or reaction baits , such as crankbaits , spinnerbaits and topwaters . " To me , reaction baits are more critical in fine-tuning a pattern than a jig or a bottom-bouncing bait , " says Reese . " Essentially , when a fish eats a jig or worm , it pretty much engulfs the whole bait . Sometimes it will tail-bite a worm and you have to let it eat the bait a bit longer . But with hard baits and spinnerbaits , it 's a lot more important to pay attention to where the fish is hooked . " According to Reese , one sign that you 're locked into a strong pattern is when the hook is in the back of the bass ' mouth . This indicates that your lure selection , color and presentation are perfectly matched to the activity level and desires of the fish on that particular day . The opposite situation is when a bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a bass is hooked on the outside , it means one of two things  --  your retrieve is off or your bait selection is wrong , " says Reese . " You got a reaction strike out of that fish , but you did n't trigger it enough to engulf the bait . " When that happens , you need to fine-tune your approach . " You 're getting the bites  --  now change either your presentation or the color of your bait , " says Reese . " A lot of times a color change will make a big difference . " SLOW-MOVING LURES Former Bassmaster Angler of the Year Aaron Martens is another big believer in interpreting hook placement , especially with single-hook lures . If a bass is hooked in the upper lip , it could be a sign that the fish did n't have enough time to inhale a jig or soft-plastic . A worm hook impaled in the lower lip could also be a signal to pause slightly , says Martens . Another fix can be to switch to a rod with a softer tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to , " Martens adds . " Ideally , that would be through the cheek . A cheek-hook is best because it means the fish wanted that bait and it will stay hooked . If you get the fish in the area where the teeth are , there 's that tough cartilage that you can hardly penetrate unless it 's with a flipping hook . " Short-striking bass  --  those that follow or even nip at a moving bait  --  often represent fish that are attracted enough to pursue a lure , but do n't take it aggressively . To hook these fish , slow the speed of your presentation and wait just a second longer before setting the hook . Use caution , however : It might have been the speed of the lure that piqued the fish 's interest in the first place . BOX Master Your Hooks Aaron Martens has spent more time thinking about hooks than most bass enthusiasts . That comes with being a die-hard tackle tinkerer and professional angler . Here are some of Marten 's best tips for getting the most out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treble hooks , you 'll often boat a bass that has been snagged on the outside of the mouth . This happens when the fish just slaps at your offering but is n't totally committed to taking the lure . To increase hook-ups with less-than-enthusiastic bass , try bending your hooks out slightly . " I use extra-wide-gap Gamakatsu hooks a lot , but I do n't like how they 're bent inward , so I bend them out just a little bit . That helps snag those fish a little better . " USE YOUR BIGGEST HOOK Use the largest hook size that does n't interfere with the lure 's motion . " If it comes with a size four , put a three or a two on it . Be careful that it does n't change the action of the bait too much . A lot of times it might be too heavy and the bait will sink . " CHECK YOUR BARBS Despite precision manufacturing , not all hooks are created equal . " Check the barbs on your hooks . You would think barbs would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be , and if you happen to hook a fish on that barb , it will throw the hook .
