Golden By Jennifer Lynn Barnes Random House Jennifer Lynn Barnes 1 blue Dark . Looking around , I saw nothing , but I could feel the wrongness of it all in the air , and the hairs on the back of my neck stood straight up . Why could n't I see ? I was blind and terrified , and the ground shook violently beneath me . The earth burst into flames , and with the heat on my neck , images raced through my mind . Three intertwining circles , rings of different colors on a silver shield . Grams and Mom , Lexie and me . Paul . Fire and colors , color and fire , even though it was still dark . Shadows and light . Shadows and light and color , and then , there was nothing . My eyes flew open , and I gasped for air . Where was I ? Why was my face squashed up against a window ? Was I drooling ? And who were those girls staring at me ? My mind still a mess of images from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and quickly checked my chin for drool . E Two days trapped in a car with my family , and I was drooling . " Back to the land of the living , Lissy ? " my mom asked from the front seat . I would have shot her a dirty look ( how hard was it to remember that I wanted to be called Felicity and not Lissy ? ) , but I could n't seem to look away from the window . Or , more specifically , the scene outside the window . You know those mythical creatures that have snakes for hair and if you look at them , theyturn you to stone with their deadly gaze ? Well , the looks the three teenage girls in the car next to us were sending my way had me good and stoned , and not in a Just Say No kind of way . The blonde in the driver 's seat had this soft , sick smile on her face , and she met my eyes as if to clarify that yes , she was laughing at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no , I did n't have a right to be looking back at her . I wanted to look away . I tried to look away , but the best I could manage was shifting my gaze from the blonde to the passenger seat . A girl with long , dark hair arched one eyebrow in my general direction , somehow managing to stare down at me , even though she was in a tiny convertible and I was in an SUV . Impressive . Again , I tried to look away , but I was stone . Stone that still might have had some drool on the left side of her chin . I turned my attention to the last girl in the car . An obvious fake blonde , she snarled at me for a full four seconds and then glanced down at her fingernails . Apparently , I was just interesting enough to merit a snarl , but not more interesting than her French manicure . " What were you dreaming about ? " Lexie 's voice broke into my mind , and finally , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced back a microsecond later , I 'd faded from their radar , and they sped up and passed us on the left . " Were you dreaming about Paul ? " I narrowed my eyes at Lexie , but apparently , my snarl needed a little work . " You were dreaming about Paul , " my little sister declared softly , her eyes wide and her voice sure . " Were n't you ? " Lexie looked earnestly up at me , a lopsided smile on her pixie face . It was impossible to stay mad at my sister , even when I wanted to , much like it was completely impossible not to think about the fact that the only teenagers I 'd come across so far since we 'd entered this " state " had seen me with my nose pressed up against a window . What if they 'd seen up my nose ? As if the drool was n't bad enough . " Lissy ? Dream ? Paul ? " Lexie was nothing if not persistent . " Among other things , " I muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't know about Paul and me , if there was anything to know , and the last thing I wanted to do was spend the final leg of our car ride playing the Probing Questions game . Lexie got the message loud and clear , and she did n't say anything else . I stared out my window , watching the trees and telephone poles fly by and keeping my eyes peeled for blue convertibles . After a while , the trees blurred together , I stopped wondering if anyone had seen up my nose , and I let myself get caught up in memory . Paul Carter : next-door neighbor , partner in crime , best friend . Paul , who called me Weasel and insisted it was a term of endearment . Paul , who laughed with me , even when I was n't funny . Paul , who had held my hand on the first day of kindergarten and sat on the beach with me after our first day of high school . Paul . I could practically see him as he had been when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sand in his dark hair , his eyes locked on mine . He 'd kissed me . I 'd been ubercrushing on my best friend , Paul Carter , ever since he 'd dumped sand down my back when we were four , and right before my parents , Lexie , and I had packed our bags and moved halfway across the country , he 'd kissed me . Actually kissed me . We 'd meant to say goodbye then . We 'd wanted to go out on a high note : s'mores on the beach and then watching horrendous science fiction B-movies , completely without any mention of the fact that I was leaving . Things had been proceeding according to plan , and then boom : he 'd kissed me . In retrospect , it had n't been a boom at all . It was actually more of a whoosh , as my lungs collapsed and my heart stopped beating , followed quickly by an imaginary sound that I could only describe as the accordion noise cartoon characters always made after they 'd been hit with an anvil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who knows how far from civilization , all I had left of Paul was the seashell he 'd given me on my sixth birthday , his last words to me ( " I 'll miss you , Weasel " ) , and a memory of him on the beach . The colored lights around him had stood out , midnight blue against the stark white sand , moving in slow waves as he watched me drive away forever .
