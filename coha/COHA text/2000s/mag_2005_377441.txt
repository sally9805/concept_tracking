What Teachers Hate About Parents <P> " People wonder why children are rude , belligerent and disrespectful . Your article has the answer : they learn it from their parents . " <P> JILL A. GORZE - Pittsburgh <P> I TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH FOR 34 years and can strongly identify with your article " Parents Behaving Badly " Feb. 21 . It is so refreshing to read something from the teacher 's point of view for a change . Most articles note the flaws in the education profession but seldom discuss , let alone blame , parents for any part in the problem . I am pleased that most of the parents I was actually able to reach were cooperative . I did , however , occasionally encounter a mom or dad who displayed a less than realistic view of the adolescent angel taking up space ( and often little else ) in my classroom . <P> ANASTASIA TEROVOLAS - Elmwood Park , Ill . <P> TO TRIVIALIZE PARENTS ' CONCERNS about their children 's education by referring to them as " mama grizzly bears " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools . Educators need to understand that the days of viewing the teacher as " the expert in education " are over . If a parent 's advocacy of a student or school program looks like adversity to a teacher , perhaps it is because the teacher is squirming under the just weight of accountability . <P> SHELLEY L. HOUSTON - Eugene , Ore . <P> I AM THE MOTHER OF TEENAGERS WHO are succeeding in school , and I thank the competent teachers they have had . I know I could not do a better job . Parents who think they can should home-school . <P> NORA MARTIN VETTO - Scottsdale , Ariz . <P> FINALLY ! A PUBLICATION THAT HAS THE guts to call a spade a spade . This behavior of overprotective parents has gone on far too long . Parents , shape up or ship out ! School boards , hire superintendents with the courage to instill some discipline in students . Only when parents stop spoiling their children and administrators stop being " politically correct " will this bad behavior cease . <P> HARRY BRUNDRIDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS WHAT parents hate about teachers.I hate teachers who can not spell or write . I hate the fact that these illiterate underachievers are responsible for teaching and evaluating my children . I hate the fact that these teachers receive the support of a union that makes the Teamsters look like wimps . I hate the fact that teachers apparently wish to claim all the credit for good students but blame parents for bad students . And I hate the mere notion that teachers are even asked what they hate about parents . <P> MARY ENGELMAN - Cherry Hill , N.J. <P> AS A RETIRED HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL with 37 years in education , I thank you for your report . It was balanced and right on target . Teachers will feel gratified that someone understands and sympathizes with their growing plight . Parents who fit the negative paradigms should take a good look in the mirror  --  and reflect . <P> DENNIS NAUGHTON - Foxborough , Mass.
