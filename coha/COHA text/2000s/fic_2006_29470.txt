Chapter One Most people would have done what I did , " I say . " That 's an interesting statement , " the shrink says . " Most people would n't kill a man who was like a father to them . " " He was n't my father . " " I said ' like ' a father . " I nod , because that was true . " I guess , when you think about it , " I say , " he gave me things my father never did . But he also took things away . Money . My wife . My child . Things no father would take from his son . " " What do you mean he took them ? " the shrink asks . " That 's not what really happened , is it ? He did n't take your wife . " " Okay . He moved the pieces on the board in a way that they were taken from me . It 's all the same . " " And he deserved to die for that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any of them deserved it , " I say . " But it happened , and it would have happened that way to most people . All I wanted was to get ahead , to have my wife , my family . " " Do you really think so , Thane ? " he says , looking at his notebook . " That most people would have done what you did ? " " I thought you shrinks are supposed to ask about my mother . What 's all this father stuff ? " " You did n't kill your mother-figure , " he says in his deep rumble of a voice . " Or my wife . " He raises an eyebrow . " Why do you mention her ? Did she deserve what happened ? " I look awayand sigh . " In a way . Maybe . I dream about it . Her . " " Freud said dreams are wishes , " he says . " Look . Let 's just start from the beginning . How about you tell me the story ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I can help . " " You think I need help ? " I say . " I 'm a shell . A couple of weeks and I 'm out of here . This is just going through the motions . I 'll walk out of here and I wo n't even be Thane Coder anymore . Mike Jenkins . That 's the name they 're giving me . They 've got me a job in a metal shop . Fifteen dollars an hour and a little two-bedroom box outside Bozeman . You ever been to Montana ? " " You 're still a person , " he says . " You still need to cope . " Over the past six years , I 've seen other guys like this . Other shrinks with dreams of helping those beyond help , or who did n't have what it takes to have an officeful of books and leather furniture . They never really help . They just dredge up the muck that 's better off left at the bottom . But there 's something about the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk , even about this . " How far back ? " I ask with a sigh . " What about the storm ? " he says , tapping his pen . " Tell me about that . From what I 've seen in your file , that seems to push a button . " On the other side of the brick and bars , I hear the sound of the scum spilling out into the yard below . Hooting in the cold air . Their words drift skyward in smoky puffs . The noise of their obscene banter is muffled by the dirty window of the small square room . I look out and see the wall . At its crest the empty eye of the tower stares down . A guard bent over a book . His rifle nowhere in sight . I think about Jessica , my wife . Pretty dark hair . Sexy in a girlish way . She was a sweet girl . That 's how I 'd describe her , what she was , even after everything . Even though I blame her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " I never thought I could kill anyone , " I say , then I sigh again because I know I 'm going to tell him , even though it wo n't do either of us any good . " I do n't mean in a rage , or in self-defense , or in a war . I mean killing someone to get what you want . That was n't me . But even the best of us has that bad side . I 'm not saying I was the best , but I was n't the worst either . I think I was about where most people are . It was the situation . " He 's taking notes now , the blue Bic rolling across the yellow paper . One fat finger is constricted by a college ring with an orange stone . The gold inscriptions are flattened and worn . I 'm used to the shrinks writing when I talk , but not this way , in big looping letters that list to one side . " What ? " he says . " Nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men too . The ones I killed . You believe that ? But love , hate . Sometimes they 're close , right ? " The shrink smiles like I just figured out that the world is round . He grabs his college ring and gives it a twist . " And , I wanted the money . Real money . Yeah , I know . I had millions coming to me . But the more money you have , the more you want . You own a mansion on the beach in Tortola , you want a private plane to get there . Then your neighbor takes you out on his yacht and you think how nice that 'd be . Maybe a chopper to get there quicker . It never ends . Trust me , when I started out , I thought if I could make a hundred thousand dollars a year with a mortgage-free house I 'd have everything I ever needed . That was before Jessica , though . " " You blame that on her , then ? " he asks . " This greed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass things off on other people , " I say . " But you listen , then you figure out how much of it was me and how much her . You 'll get it . " I take a deep breath and say : " Six years ago , but it does n't seem that long . It was a bad night . " " In what way ? " " In the way that after that , it was all downhill , " I say . " The weather too , this cold rain and wet snow that fell straight down . The sky was black .
