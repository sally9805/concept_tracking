<p> Stephen Portch left his job as chancellor of the University System of Georgia with more than a gold watch and a handshake : He got a deal paying him $450,000 for giving advice to his former employer , employees and successor . <p> And all public college presidents , such as University of Georgia President Michael Adams and Georgia Tech President Wayne Clough , could stay on the state payroll , too , if they resign . <p> The money is part of the deal that helped lure Portch to Georgia in 1994 from the University of Wisconsin System , according to state documents obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . But as Georgia colleges warn of layoffs and enrollment freezes after two years of budget cuts , some legislators are outraged by Portch 's payments . <p> Sen. George Hooks ( D-Americus ) , who was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee when Portch was chancellor , was momentarily speechless when told about the agreement . <p> " That 's incredible , that is off the scale , " Hooks said . " I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University System is talking of massive layoffs , immediate steps should be taken to revise this policy . " Senate President Pro Tem Eric Johnson ( R-Savannah ) said , " I think it 's outrageous we 're paying somebody that much money while we 're cutting pay and reducing educational services . It makes some of their whining about the budget sound like crocodile tears . " <p> Under a little-known policy approved before he was hired to run the 34-school system in 1994 , Portch was paid $272,430 last year , the year after he resigned , while the second-year payment , $181,620 , is being divided over the following three years . <p> In exchange , he is essentially on call to give advice and information to his successor , Thomas Meredith , system staffers and members of the Board of Regents , which governs the University System . He was paid about $300,000 in his last year as chancellor . <p> The 11-year-old policy lets the system retain former chancellors and college presidents in jobs for two years , paying them 90 percent of their previous salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn White , a member of the Board of Regents who was chairman when Portch resigned in 2001 , said the policy gives the state an edge in looking for administrative talent . The policy replaced an earlier one that stripped presidents of their job tenure protections before they assumed office . <p> " You 're trying to compete out there and get the best-quality people , and that is part of the upfront package , " White said . <p> The policy says presidents whose resignation is accepted by the chancellor are awarded a tenure track or nontenure track appointment for two years . The deal was included in the letter the board gave Portch offering him the job . <p> Hours not specified <p> Seven years later , the letter accepting Portch 's resignation and outlining his future pay said he would work for the board as a senior policy adviser . <p> " Your specific duties will be mutually determined by you , the new chancellor and the board and may include assisting with the transition , providing policy advice , and facilitating Board of Regents strategic planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon , " the letter said . " You may devote as much time as reasonably required to other personal and professional business ventures ( including part-time consulting ) , as long as such business ventures do not conflict with your responsibilities to the board . " <p> System officials could n't specifically say how many hours a week Portch works for the system . Portch sometimes comes to Atlanta to perform his duties , and he represents the state on national boards and associations , said Arlethia Perry-Johnson , associate vice chancellor for media and publications . <p> She said Portch had worked on several key system projects . For instance , she said , he helped her shape the research and hire researchers on a highly publicized effort designed to keep African-American males in high school and steer them to college . <p> Portch , who lives in Alabama and works as an education consultant , declined to comment for this article other than saying , " I am pleased to have an ongoing relationship with the University System of Georgia to assist with policy and other matters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is paid about $273,000 by the state and nearly $200,000 more by the system 's foundation , also would be eligible for a position in the system if he resigned . He referred questions about Portch 's compensation package to White . <p> However , when asked what Portch did for the system , Meredith said in a written statement , " I confer with Stephen Portch on a regular basis on a wide variety of issues which call upon his knowledge and history of the University System . " <p> Portch , 53 , came to the University System as a hot property in 1994 . Then-Gov . Zell Miller called him " the most important thing to happen in Georgia in a long , long time . " <p> During his tenure , Portch and the regents toughened admissions standards , making high school students take more core courses to better prepare for college . SAT scores of entering freshmen climbed above the national average , and the number of students being admitted needing remedial help dropped . He sided with the University of Georgia in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting a small percentage of admissions , and he regularly called for more diversity on college campuses . <p> Deals not uncommon <p> But the English-bred Flannery O'Connor scholar also had tense moments with some lawmakers , especially those who helped write state budgets . By switching the system from quarters to semesters , the number of weeks a course lasted increased . But the switch brought complaints and a legislative bailout because students initially took fewer credits , meaning colleges received less state funding . <p> When Portch decided he had served long enough , Miller 's successor , Roy Barnes , asked him to stay . However , Portch said he had told the regents he would n't remain in the job more than seven years . <p> The regents ' deals with Portch and college presidents are similar to those made with top business executives , and they are fairly common at universities across the country , according to Claire Van Ummersen , vice president and director of the Office of Women in Higher Education at the Washington-based American Council on Education . <p> " There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there are others who head up foundations or institutes , " said Van Ummersen , former chancellor of the University System of New Hampshire . " For instance , if a president has been a particularly good fund-raiser , that person may have a special contract with a campus to assist them in that area . " <p> Johnson , the Senate president pro tem , did n't necessarily fault the policy , but he questioned why so few legislators knew about it . Portch 's consulting deal was referred to only as Policy 203 during the public meeting at which the Board of Regents accepted his resignation , board meeting minutes show . <p> " At least it should be out in the open , " Johnson said . " Let 's give the Legislature and taxpayers the transparency on compensation packages . " <p> The policy does n't kick in if a president leaves for an outside job . For instance , when University of Georgia President Charles Knapp left in 1997 to become head of a Washington think tank , he did not receive compensation under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one situation where it applies , and that is when a president or chancellor steps down from their executive position within the University System to accept another position within the system , " she said . <p> Former Savannah State University President John Wolfe resigned in 1997 under pressure from faculty and students . <p> Among concerns cited were declining enrollment , a high turnover rate of top-level administrators , and poor campus conditions , especially of dormitories . <p> Portch brought Wolfe to the University System central office as an associate chancellor for academic affairs , a post he still holds , at a salary of $113,782 , according to system records . <p> Perry-Johnson said former Georgia College &; State University President Edwin Speir returned to teaching after resigning , while former Middle Georgia College President Steve Maradian went to Washington to work on federal grant programs for the state 's University System . <p> Lean times for state <p> Lawmakers said it was difficult to justify paying Portch $450,000 for advice at a time when agencies are worrying about having to close prisons and nursing homes because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 billion . <p> Officials at the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech have warned of layoffs if lawmakers continue to cut their budgets . State funding for the University System has been cut by $211.4 million since 2001 , officials said . <p> An additional 2.5 percent cut for the current fiscal year  --  which Gov . Sonny Perdue required from all state agencies in August  --  will cost the system an additional $41.2 million . Perdue has proposed a 5 percent cut in fiscal 2005 , which begins July 1 . Perry-Johnson said that would cost the University System $80 million more . <p> Any further reductions would have to be approved by the Legislature , which convenes in January .
