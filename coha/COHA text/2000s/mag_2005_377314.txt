After the Iraq Election <P> " We may wonder whether the Iraqis can rule themselves . But remember , the British may have had the same question about American colonists . " <P> PHIL GONZALEZ Houston <P> NOW THAT THE IRAQ ELECTION IS OVER , we Americans should say we have done all we can and get out Jan. 31 . Iraq belongs to the Iraqis , and only they can rule their country . Our staying would give legitimacy to the claim that we are occupying their country . Let 's leave Iraq before it becomes a quagmire for us . <P> ISABELLE CHANG Shrewsbury , Mass . <P> YOUR COVER PHOTOGRAPH OF PRIVATE First Class Christopher Lujan put a haunting , human face on the war in Iraq . Lujan , with his innocent face , seemed out of place in the uniform of war and on the streets of hell . Many of us are unable to comprehend how , at the beginning of a new millennium , we are still sending out our beloved children to kill and maim one another . Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOWE Beaverton , Ore . <P> WHY IS NO ONE DISCUSSING THE POSSIbility of replacing the coalition forces in Iraq with friendly or at least neutral forces from Arab countries ? Egypt and Jordan should assist in the peacekeeping . Muslim countries should help Iraqi Muslims until an Iraqi army is in place . <P> PETER B. SAADEH New York City <P> I SAW THE PICTURES OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE walking to the polls to exercise their right to vote in the face of death threats , bombs and with entire families in jeopardy . To vote in spite of all that takes courage above and beyond what most Americans would show today . The Iraqis expressed the true spirit of democracy . <P> SKIP HALL Columbiana , Ala . <P> Bush 's Brave Words <P> CAN COLUMNIST JOE KLEIN REALLY BE SO naive as to believe the rhetoric in George W. Bush 's Inauguration speech about bringing freedom to the world Jan. 31 ? If spreading liberty around the globe were an authentic goal of this Administration , it would not rely on alliances with Saudi Arabia , Pakistan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPEECH WAS FIRM , positive and optimistic . The President showed great character and strength in the face of adversity . His implied message was that the ongoing war in Iraq does not mean the U.S. can not take on other adversaries or effect change where necessary to promote democracy . Bush is a strong leader . <P> OLABODE MOSES OLUGA Chicago <P> THE PRESIDENT 'S SPEECH WAS ONLY HIS narrow vision of imperialistic dogma . <P> WILLIAM H. WAXMAN Santa Rosa , Calif . <P> BUSH IS A GREAT LEADER . HE SPOKE about freedom , democracy and how the U.S. will promote liberty all over the world . The American people helped Europeans regain freedom and democracy after World War II . They are doing the same thing today in Iraq and Afghanistan . Americans know the cost of liberty , but they wo n't change their ideals . I trust President Bush . I 'm sorry that I could n't vote for him . <P> EMANUELA PRADELLA Arona , Italy <P> Too Much Partying ?              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
