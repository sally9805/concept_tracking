Willy Kunkle dipped his large right hand into the sink and scooped a splash of warm water onto his face , washing away the last of the shaving soap . He straightened , used the edge of a towel hanging to the right of the mirror to mop his cheeks and chin with the same hand , and studied his reflection in the harsh fluorescent light . He was n't looking for flaws in his shaving . And , God knows , there was no narcissism taking place . Willy was the first to acknowledge his was a purely functional appearance . He had what was necessary : a nose , two eyes , a mouth , none of it particularly remarkable . As far as it went , it was just a face . And yet he studied it every morning the same way , carefully , warily , especially watching the eyes for any deepening of the intensity which even he found disturbing . Had he seen them on somebody else , they were eyes that would have given him pause-eyes which troubled him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole truly something to remember , and although he did n't know it , they were the one feature almost everyone remembered about his face . His scrutiny drifted lower , again as usual , to his neck , to his collarbone , and finally to his left shoulder and the useless arm below it . He 'd been symmetrical once-at the very least that . Now he wassomeone who carried an arm as an eccentric might perpetually lug around a heavy stuffed animal . Except that his burden was n't that interesting . It was just an arm , withered , pale , splotchy with poor circulation-something straight out of Dachau but pinned to his otherwise healthy body-put there by a rifle bullet in a police shootout years ago . In fact , the scar marked the dividing line between the alive and the dead of his body the way a ragged and permanent tear identifies where a sleeve has been torn from a shirt . It did draw attention away from the eyes , though . People overlooked them altogether when describing him as " the cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Willy was concerned . He appreciated that a lesser but adequately flamboyant deformity covered for a far more telling one . It suited his personality . And his need . As he 'd watched those eyes every morning-those windows into the workings of his head-he 'd actually become grateful for the arm . It was his own built-in red herring . He reached up and turned off the light . Time to go to work . Winter had passed by at last , even mud season was nearing an end . A year 's worth of weather in Vermont has been called nine months of winter and three more of damned poor sledding , but a quantity of subtleties is lost there . In fact , to those brought up in its midst , Vermont offers as many temperature and mood swings as any moderately complicated marriage , which is also how many natives view their relationship with the state . Willy Kunkle was not a native . A " flatlander " by birth , transplanted from New York almost twenty years before , he did n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either hot or cold to him , dry or wet . And discussing it was n't going to change anything . Still , this was a very pleasant morning , and despite himself , he enjoyed the almost uncomfortably cold air drifting in through the open car window on his drive downtown . Willy lived in Brattleboro , Vermont , a topsy-turvy , nineteenth century , postindustrial town of some twelve thousand residents squeezed into the state 's southeast corner , hard by the Connecticut River and straddling three of Interstate 91 's first exits out of Massachusetts . This was a significant geographical detail . It made of Brattleboro the first taste of small-town Vermont to all those high-speed travelers coming out of the south , which is why a multimillion-dollar , high-tech welcome center had just been erected below Exit 1 , and helped explain the town 's financial survival when other historical mementos , like Springfield , Bellows Falls , and Windsor farther north , complete with similarly picturesque redbrick hearts , had faded to become mere economic ghosts of their former selves . More specific credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back during the sixties , a small army of disaffected social dropouts , dizzy with blurry images of sylvan splendor and a thirst for isolation , barely crossed the state line to set up communes , natural food restaurants , and back-to-the-earth farms . Eventually , once the spiritual glow had either faded or aged , these erstwhile hippies amended enough of their more doctrinaire enthusiasms to become an integral part of an interestingly quirky , often contentious social fabric . To the local police , however , Brattleboro 's proximity to New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and the interstate had been slowly transforming the town from what the chamber of commerce called the gateway to Vermont into its doormat , a magnet for all the ills leaking out of the urban south-a cynical and narrow view , no doubt , but allowable given the source . It also helped explain Willy Kunkle 's presence here . An ex ? New York City patrolman , a Vietnam vet , and a dedicated alcoholic , Willy had ended up in Brattleboro first because he 'd needed gas on his way to someplace-anyplace-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been love at first sight or like having a revelation , but the double discovery of Brattleboro 's busy downtown and a poster advertising openings at the police department had conspired to make him stay . He 'd begun by walking the streets , shunning patrol cars in exchange for the traditional beat , and had honed a talent for making contacts and connections in those parts of town few upstanding citizens cared to acknowledge . In the process , he 'd become the one cop who most reliably could extract information where others came up empty-handed . Thus , a serendipitous stop for gas and a job had led to a personal and professional progression he 'd tried since to forget . Marching less to his own drummer and more as if on autopilot , Willy went through the standard evolutionary motions , watching himself like a spectator at a private parade . He met a local girl more confused than he , married her without much thought from either one of them , got transferred to the detective bureau in reward for his good work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , slow , agonizing period of years , he became like a gambler , his stake eroding to nothing , fully aware that his chances of winning were nil , but unwilling to change strategies and unable to leave the table . The alcohol abuse and disillusion led to self-loathing and anger , to wife abuse and a preordained divorce . He was crippled by a bullet in the line of duty , transferred off the police force , and came within half a step of joining the people he 'd once been paid to arrest . Then , in defiance of the gravitational pull he should have followed straight to the bottom , and with much the same disappointed bewilderment experienced by a drowner miraculously pulled back from a death finally become soothingly seductive , he was put back on the police payroll , told to fill in the proper paperwork , and accepted as a member of a newly created , statewide investigative agency called the Vermont Bureau of Investigation , with five regional offices , including one in Brattleboro . Thus encouraged-almost cajoled-he 'd gone from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sheer willpower , finding himself romantically involved with a female co-worker , and being regarded as one of the elite in his profession . A roller-coaster ride of mixed and paradoxical emotions , and a happy , bittersweet end result entirely due-as he saw it in a typically angry dismissal of his own personal efforts-to a man named Joe Gunther . Willy frowned and sighed heavily at the thought , cresting the top of High Street as it descended to intersect Main downtown , nearby Mount Wantastiquet in neighboring New Hampshire looming over a wall of buildings directly before him like a sleeping giant . Joe Gunther hung on Willy 's mind almost as much as the dead arm now resting in his lap . Willy had read somewhere-unless he 'd seen it at the movies-that in certain cultures , if you saved someone 's life , that poor bastard was stuck having to return the debt and therefore keep you company until the day he could make good . If ever . Well , much as he hated to admit it , Willy probably owed his life to Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department 's detective squad , had hovered sympathetically when he 'd wrestled with booze and the divorce . He 'd threatened to invoke the Americans with Disabilities Act and sue the town to get Willy back on the force after his injury . He 'd cut him slack time and again , had n't taken offense when Willy did his damnedest to give it , and had acted as a go-between when Willy had fallen in love with Sammie Martens-the other detective who 'd made the move from the PD to the Bureau . Finally , after the legislature had created the VBI and the commissioner of public safety had tapped Joe as its field force commander , he 'd made it clear that he would n't take the job unless Willy 's application was given a fair review , after which he 'd persuaded Willy to apply . Why ? Because Joe was a decent guy who acted the same way with everyone , and because , while he might not have been the life of any party , he was like a dog with a bone when it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of times , when Willy raged at this man . He waited at the stoplight , preparing to turn left up Main . There was a shorter route to the office , but driving through downtown every morning had become a ritual . The pedestrian walk sign began flashing , accompanied by an obnoxious chirping sound designed to help the blind cross safely . Willy shook his head . Only in Brattleboro , capital city of granola heads , where nothing ever happened without everyone worrying about how everyone else felt about it . There was enough hot air in this town to pop the Titanic back to the surface like a cork . This cynicism belied Willy 's years of service to this community , and his caring for its vital signs the way a doctor would a patient 's every ache and pain . He drove north , up Main toward the new , modern courthouse , perched on a grassy knoll like a shiny anchored ship , forcing the street to split around it like a current . Across the way , balanced on a second hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . A remodeled high nineteenth century school , all bricks and spires and wrought-iron knickknacks , it was where Willy used to work as a cop and still did as a special agent , since the VBI had a small office located on the monstrosity 's second floor . His morning rounds completed , Willy circled the courthouse , cut around the block , and parked in the lot behind the municipal building . Upstairs , Sammie Martens paused by the window at the end of the central hallway just outside the ladies ' room , holding a pitcher of water intended for the office coffee machine . She saw Willy get out of his car , cross the parking lot , and vanish from view as he entered the building . She waited to greet him , knowing he 'd come straight up , as usual . She preferred seeing him first in private , if possible , especially if they had n't spent the previous night together . It helped prepare her for whatever mood he might be in . Dark to middling was the standard she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays , she was happy to note , there was the occasional suggestion that he was lightening up . She listened in vain for his footsteps coming up the stairs , eventually resting the pitcher on the windowsill . It seemed he 'd run into someone in the lobby . She glanced out the window again , attracted by a sudden movement below , and saw Willy running back to his car , fumbling for his keys . Surprised , she returned to the office , placed the water beside the coffeemaker , and addressed the older man sitting behind one of the four corner desks . " Joe , did we just have a call come in ? My pager did n't go off . " Joe Gunther looked up from what he 'd been reading and gave her a thoughtful look before answering . " Not that I know of . " " I just saw Willy go running back out of the building to his car . " Her boss sat back in his chair and pursed his lips . " Maybe he forgot something at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look like that . I saw him drive up like usual and waited for him at the top of the stairs for almost five minutes . He never made it . " Sue was suddenly struck by her own odd choice of words . Gunther was used to Willy 's ways . In the past , it had usually paid to give him a little leeway , and sometimes much more than a little . Whether Willy was the son Joe had never had or merely possessed by a spirit Joe found perversely irresistible , the bottom line remained that Willy Kunkle was one of the most instinctive police officers Joe had ever worked with , and therefore worth a little more than the usual slack . " Give him half an hour , Sam . That 'll allow for a round trip home and then some . After that , we can start shaking the bushes . If he 's on to something , the first thing he 'll want is to be left alone . " Sammie Martens went back to making coffee , unsatisfied and faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunther again , who merely caught her eye and nodded without comment . Sammie picked up the phone and called Willy 's house . There was no answer . Frustrated , she rose and headed for the door . " I 'm going downstairs-see if I can find out what set him off . " She turned into the radio dispatch area on the first floor and rapped on the bulletproof glass separating the dispatchers from the public . A woman half rose in her seat to peer over the console between them . " Hey , Sam . " Her voice was made metallic by the two-way intercom . " What 's happenin ' ? " " I 'm looking for Willy . You see him this morning ? " The woman 's expression registered surprise , then confusion . " He did n't tell you guys ? " She gestured to the side . " Come around to the door . " Sammie moved down the hallway to a locked door that opened almost as soon as she reached it . The dispatcher took her through the patrol officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PD 's parking enforcement division , calling through the door of her own office as she did so , " Wayne , cover for me a sec , will you ? " " It was kinda funny , " she explained to Sammie . " We got a call from a New York City detective asking if we could send an officer to locate someone named William Kunkle , who supposedly lived in Brattleboro . I started laughing and told him no one went out of their way to dig up Willy if they could avoid it . The guy was dead quiet , so I explained that Willy was a cop who worked upstairs . Which was exactly when Willy walked by the window . So I shouted to him to take the call on the wall phone . I was watching when he answered . He looked really intense for a couple of minutes , and then he hung up and vanished , just like that . " She snapped her fingers . " I figured he was booking it upstairs to see you . " Sammie Martens shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running back to his car . What was the name of the New York cop ? " " Hang on . " The woman crossed the narrow hallway into the dispatch area and retrieved a pad from her console desk . " Detective Ogden . " She handed the pad over . " That 's the number . " Sammie placed her hand on a nearby phone . " This okay ? " The woman nodded before resuming her seat at the console . Sammie dialed and heard a deep , clear , almost radio-quality male voice pick up on the other end . " Detective squad-Ogden . " " Detective Ogden , this is Special Agent Samantha Martens of the Vermont Bureau of Investigation in Brattleboro . You just talked to a colleague of mine , Willy Kunkle ? " " That I did . " " I do n't want to step on any toes here , but could I ask what you talked about ? He took out of here like a jackrabbit and did n't tell us what was up . " There was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could have my supervisor call you . Or you can call him , so you 'd know for sure I am who I say I am . VBI 's in the phone book . " Ogden relented . " It 's nothing that confidential . We were looking for a next-of-kin for a DOA we have down here . " Sammie was stunned and increasingly confused , having had to make a few calls like that herself . " Oh , my God . One of his family ? But why call him ? He has relatives right in New York that could act as next-of-kin . " " It 's not that easy . The woman we have is n't strictly family . In fact , we do n't know who she 's related to . All we found in her apartment were her divorce papers from Mr. Kunkle . That 's why I called him . I was looking for a blood relation and thought he could help . I did n't realize he took it so hard . That did n't come across in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did he give you a name ? " " Her mother 's , but he said it would be a waste of time . And he was right . I just hung up on her . Told me her daughter had been dead to her for years already-that she did n't want anything to do with her . Actually , I 'm kind of glad you called , ' cause we need a definite ID on this woman- " " Mary , " Sammie interrupted . " That was her name . " Ogden was caught off guard . " What ? Oh , right . Sorry . Did you know her ? " " We met once , a long time ago . Department picnic . " " Okay . Well , anyway , we really need someone to ID Mary , and it 's looking like William might be it , if he 's willing . Mary 's mother said that would suit her fine . " Sammie was filled with sadness , anxiety , even a perverse pinch of jealousy . She 'd only met Mary Kunkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their history as a couple , and the guilt that Willy carried for having beaten her once in a drunken rage and bringing the marriage to ruin . Never an emotional brick at the best of times , Willy was going to take this hard . " What did she die of ? " " We 're looking good for an accidental overdose . You think you could help me out ? " Ogden asked . Oh , Christ , Sammie thought , the word " overdose " rising like a snake from hiding . Now she knew for sure what channel Willy was on , which made her all the more fearful . " I do n't think I need to , " she answered . " He 's already on his way . "
