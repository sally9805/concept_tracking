In which Rick Renard , PR hustler par excellence , sets out to save Grimlands gentle giants of the deep . A short story // It had been quite a week . On Monday one of our clients , the leader of a major Eastern European country , was accused of poisoning his opponent in the presidential election . While it may be true that I take on clients that some PR firms avoid , we at Renard Strategic Communications do not , as a rule , seek those who invite their political opponents to dinner and serve them borscht la dioxin . On Tuesday the Professional Curling Association of Northwestern Wisconsin-not a marquee name , I grant , but a client-admitted that its top curler was not only a Canadian national but was also wanted by the Mounties for dynamite fishing . Personally , I think dynamite fishing is a more efficient way of catching fish than standing in cold water for hours , but I acknowledge that local laws were broken . Then , on Thursday , we learned that another client , whose Senate confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a country in Central America-had fifteen years before served as a paid adviser to that country 's government while it was solving a local native problem in a way certain not to impress the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . A tribe of Indians had been harassing the employees of a multinational stripmining company with blow-guns , owing to the fact that the company was strip-mining the tribe 's ancestral lands . Apparently my client had advised the government to resolve the situation by lowering nets from helicopters , scooping up the troublesome Indians , and depositing them on a barren , guano-covered island miles offshore . I like a challenge as much as the next PR person , and it 's not my job to pass moral judgment on clients , but it 's helpful when they at least alert you to the fact that they 've been involved in ethnic cleansing . At any rate , I was not having a particularly good stretch when my assistant , LaMoyne , buzzed to say that the head of something called SPOUT was on the line . " SPOUT ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " LaMoyne , " I said , " what is Rule No. 1 here at Renard Strategic Communications ? " " Which Rule No. 1 ? " LaMoyne is capable of attitude , but I tolerate it because he is so efficient . He more or less runs the dayto-day operation , leaving me free to concentrate on the philosophical aspects . " No whales , " I said . It 's nothing personal . I understand that they are wonderful and warm-blooded . Further , that all those squeaking noises they make are indicative of an impressive vocabulary . I enjoy listening to them while I 'm having a massage . But what they are saying translates in my profession to " nonbillable hours . " " I explained our policy vis -- vis cetaceans to the gentleman , " LaMoyne said . " And doubled the quote on our retainer . " " And ? " " You have a four o'clock with him . " I Googled " whales . " You want to sound up to speed with a client . I learned that a sixty-ton sperm whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in Taiwan had exploded . ( I did n't know that whales exploded . ) And that several dozen whales had recently driven themselves up on a beach in North Carolina and expired . Pro-whale groups said that this act of mass suicide was the fault of the U.S. Navy , which apparently bombards area waters with low-frequency sonar waves to detect foreign submarines . I did n't know if this was true , but if that was the price of keeping the enemy from launching a sneak attack , I was n't going to blubber about it . LaMoyne ushered Mr. Spout into my office promptly at four . He was crisply dressed in a blue suit and black shoes so highly polished I could see my reflection . He had gray buzzcut hair and a trim moustache . When he grinned , his teeth appeared capable of biting through steel cable . He did n't look like an environmentalist . I do n't go in for stereotypes , but in my experience environmentalists do n't smile much . They have this default expression , like they 're expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spilled a half million tons of crude oil into a penguin rookery . " Anders Gansevoort , " he said , giving my hand a squeeze that would have dejuiced a grapefruit . " Rick Renard , " I whimpered . " Are you familiar with our organization , Mr. Renard ? " " Of course . SPOUT is in the vanguard of cetacean conservation throughout the world . Vital work . " " Mr. Renard , are you aware of the current situation in Grimland ? " " Yes . But I 'd be interested to hear your take on it . " Grimland ... the mind raced . I vaguely remembered not being able to locate it during a high school geography test . It 's a place of interest primarily to a ) Grimlanders , b ) geologists , c ) volcano scientists , and d ) planes flying across the North Atlantic and running low on fuel . Gansevoort informed me that the country had just doubled its quota of whales to be harpooned in the coming year . I shook my head . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " On a professional basis . " This was to deflect the dreaded words " pro bono . " If you hear that phrase around the offices of Renard Strategic Communications , it 's probably someone expressing a positive opinion of an Irish rock musician . " We 'd like you to undertake an anti-whaling campaign in Grimland , " he said . " An aggressive campaign . " I silently counted to ten . This gives a client the impression you 're weighing the matter rather than his wallet . " How aggressive ? " " Whatever it takes . " " And what sort of budget did you have in mind ? " He scribbled a figure on a piece of paper and slid it across the desk . I said , " Hmmnnn . " In fact I felt like ripping off my shirt the way those Olympic women soccer players do after scoring the winning goal . He stood . " You 'll undertake this personally , I assume ? " " Certainly . " " Personally , Mr. Renard . You 'll go to Grimland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who- " " Yourself , Mr. Renard . " " I always wanted to see Grimland , " I said . " Good . " His face softened , though you could still see the granite under the topsoil . " Excellent salmon fishing . Do you fish ? " It struck me as strange that someone who wanted me to save whales was urging me to hook salmon . I was going to say , " Only with dynamite . " But Renard 's Second Rule No. 1 is " When a client is dispensing cash , keep your hands out and your mouth shut . " A few days later , as I was about to head for the airport , LaMoyne handed me a thick , neatly bound briefing book full of color-coded tabs . He excels at the briefing book , LaMoyne . Normally he likes to go on the foreign trips , especially when it 's some European capital with great restaurants and art museums and cultural what-have-you . When I did a job for Prince Charles , LaMoyne attached himself to me like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to come along ? " I said . " It 's very busy right now . " " Tell me , LaMoyne , is it the active volcanoes , or the glaciers , or the fact that the sun sets in August and does n't rise again until June ? Or that they consider rotten shark meat a delicacy ? " " Watch out for the local liquor , " he said . " It 's called " Black Death " for a reason . " I was not thrilled to be flying an airline named Grim Air , but you can smoke , the booze flows , and the flight attendants are so good-looking that your eyeballs ache . The women in Grimland are famously beautiful . According to LaMoyne 's briefing book , it comes from Nordic DNA , eleven centuries of keeping out foreigners , and eating raw fish . The country is named for its discoverer , a ninth-century Viking named Grim the Odious . The Vikings were not a warm and fuzzy people , but even by their standards Grim was a handful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a choice . He could be tied to bent pine trees and ripped in two , or exiled . Not being Grim the Stupid , he opted for exile . Grim headed west , intending to discover America . It 's a good thing he didn't-Thanksgiving would be a nightmare . He ran out of food and water and then wind . He and his men were about to start eating one another when a whale happened by . They harpooned it ; it towed them into a fogbank and then to a huge island . It was barren and icy and full of active volcanoes , but still a welcome sight . Grim decided that he had been saved by the Norse sea god Slagfinn . He declared that the only proper way to say thank you was to sacrifice one of his crew . So they rowed back out to sea , tied the end of a harpoon rope to someone 's foot , and harpooned another whale . Grim declared that they 'd do this every year on the anniversary of the discovery . This grotesque tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I now had some insight into why Grimlanders are not sentimental about whales . I probably would n't be either , if my ancestors had been dragged out of warm beds and tied to them . // Grim himself did not die in a warm bed . Eventually his men got fed up with his general odiousness , and in particular with being tied to whales . One night they got him more than usually drunk on fermented fish juice , whacked him over the head , and chucked him into a crevasse . He 's said to be still down there somewhere , chilling out . Every now and then some American billionaire shows up with a camera crew and the latest dead-Viking-locator technology and makes a documentary called something like The Search for Grim . A beautiful flight attendant nudged me awake . We 'd arrived in Kefluvik . It sounds like something you might take for an infection . Looking out the window , I wondered if things in the cockpit had gone very wrong and we 'd landed in the Paleozoic era . Grimlanders speak decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us on the planet do n't speak Grimlandic . It 's one of your more complex languages . You have to be careful . If you stress the wrong syllable , you end up saying " I shall now embed this spike in your skull " instead of " Do you take American Express ? " Grimlanders are a proud people , though I 'm not clear why . They did n't cure cancer or land on the moon . They were neutral in World War II . They did allow our ships to refuel there . Ever since , we 've maintained a military base in Grimland , on leased land , because of the strategic location : Russian submarines frequently pass by . We send out planes to drop buoys on them as they pass-our way of saying " Peek-a-boo , Ivan , we see you . " Relations between the United States and Russia were once again deteriorating , so the base was once again strategic . This fact was not lost on Grimland . It 's a year-to-year lease . At the end of each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to build something-a highway , an electrical grid , whatever . The lease was up for renewal in a few months , and the Grimlanders were hinting that it would be wonderful if someone built them a 500-acre greenhouse so that they could grow their own roughage . Hard to cultivate lettuce on the Arctic Circle . I set up my base of operations at a hotel called the Glummhtt . It sounds awful , but translates to " Friendly Sod Hut . " The clientele consists mostly of wealthy salmon fisherpersons on their way to the interior to spend $1,000 a day to stand in 35 water up to their groins . The dcor reflects this . Practically every wall is adorned with a large dead salmon . The coat hooks are whale teeth , which persuaded me not to announce the purpose of my visit to my fellow patrons at the bar . The second day I was drinking coffee and trying to coax a brainstorm out of the old left brain when a headline in the English-language weekly caught my attention . LOCAL MAN ARRESTED IN PROTEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snaffelsfjord , was arraigned before Magistrate Halverson on the charge of unlawfully interfering with commerce at the Akurvik Number 3 whale-processing plant . Ragnarsson , who has been arrested previously for similar actions , pleaded innocent and was released on his own recognizing for a hearing in three weeks time . Police arrested him after he chained himself to the front gate of the plant , impeding trucks from their normal activities thither and hither the plant . Ragnar exclamated outside the magistrate 's office that he would continue to make problematic the whale commerce . " These are great and noble creatures , " he expostulated . " They were sacred to our ancestors . It is a crime against the patrimonial gods what they are doing . " He would not desist in his effortings , Ragnar vowed , " until Grimland men of good conscience cease in their abominations upon the water . " I thanked the patrimonial gods of public relations for Ragnar Ragnarsson and set off in a taxi for Snaffelsfjord . It 's about an hour 's drive if your vehicle has a front-mounted power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , involve driving through a raging river . Snaffelsfjord consists of about three dozen tin-roofed houses and a similar number of sheep . Ragnar Ragnarsson lived on the outskirts in what looked like an authentic bog hut . He cut an imposing figure : six foot five , with brightred hair and a forked , braided beard . He was dressed in a sheepskin jacket and carried a club in his right hand . This fact and the look in his eyes-that of someone who had not enjoyed a good night 's sleep in , say , ten years-did not make me feel all that welcome . But one of the things I enjoy about public relations is the variety of people you meet . This was my first ninth-century Viking . " Mr. Ragnarsson ? " " Ernh ? " " My name is Renard , sir , and I 'm here to help you save the whales . " I stipulate that this sounded idiotic , but when you are facing a large and menacing Viking , badinage is the first casualty . Actually , Ragnar turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviceable English , and had spent a summer in Los Angeles playing bass guitar for a rock band named Pancreatic Cancer . He told me that he had done " fantastic quantities " of LSD during his U.S. sojourn , and this , along with a brief incarceration in a Mojave Desert jail cell , had brought him back to Grimland resolved to live a simple life in the manner of his ancestors . We drank numerous glasses of Black Death . He recited from memory a good deal of the Grimsaga . After the seventh or eighth glass he put his arm around my shoulders and told me to call him " Forkbeard , " the ancestral name he 'd taken for himself . The next morning I lay on my bed at the Glummhtt praying for a quick death . Whatever else they say , when Rick Renard takes on a client , he gives 110 percent . It 's only fair when you 're charging 150 percent . The client had said he wanted an aggressive campaign , and that 's what I intended to give him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , when I saw the Viking-dragon figurehead that Ragnar had affixed to the bow of the boat ( a boat I-or , rather , Gansevoort-had paid for ) , I demurred . This was not the image we were looking to project . We were standing on the dock , having a frank exchange of views , when a car drove up . The woman who got out was so beautiful she would have induced cardiac arrest in an Egyptian mummy . I stopped caring about how the Viking figurehead would play on TV . She spoke to Ragnar in Grimlandic , and then gave me an ultraviolet smile and shook my hand . " I am Harpa . I am Ragnar 's voman . " It 's been a while since they introduced themselves that way back home . Ragnar and his crew-Johann and Tooki-continued getting the boat ready . Harpa had brought us food for the trip . I put aside my video camera and volunteered to help her bring it aboard . " How you are liking Grimland ? " She had dimples , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were like emeralds-the expensive kind . " Rick , vy you are caring so great for the vales ? " " Magnificent creatures , " I croaked . She shrugged . " Just big fish . " " But Ragnar ... ? " " He 's my fellow . " She had a singsong way of speaking . " But sometimes he 's " - she pointed at her head and rolled her eyes- " hooof " " ' Hooof ? " " " There is a name for . I 'm not know in English . His doctor is giving him medicines . But sometimes he 's not taking them , and then ve haf the big argumenting . I think he like the feeling vidout the medicine . " Ragnar shouted at me to hurry up . But I wanted to get to the bottom of this interesting-sounding aspect of the man I was about to put to sea with . " Sometimes he 's being very happy . Then sometimes very sad . He stay in his hut forever and not come out . I vorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . Sometimes he 's on North Pole , then sometimes-/iooof-South Pole . " Ragnar bellowed at me to get aboard . The engines had started . " What about his medicine ? " I said . " Did he take his pills today ? " " He say he do . But I do n't know . Anyvay , if he start to make like crazy , best you come back quick . " Ragnar insisted on a dedication ceremony . He broke a bottle of Black Death over the bow ( I 'm surprised it did n't take all the paint off ) and grumbled some words in homage to Slagfmn . He insisted that I get it all down on video . I dutifully filmed it , though I had no intention of including it in the final footage . My goal was to create sympathy , not get us all thrown into the local mental asylum . Between the North Atlantic swell and the diesel fumes and the anticipation of finding myself between a whale and a cannon-launched harpoon , I was not feeling totally 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew and then curled up in the fetal position under a tarp . PR is not always the glamorous job it is made out to be . A few hours later my sleep was interrupted by a commotion around the radar set . I felt the engines revving . I struggled to my feet and started filming . Ragnar pointed to a blip on the radar screen . He altered course toward it . You could smell it from a mile off . If you are not feeling tip-top to begin with , the smell of a commercial whaling ship is not going to make you feel any better . // Ragnar got on the radio and began palavering with the captain in Grimlandic . He was grinning . I was not encouraged by this . " What did he say , Ragnar ? " " That he vill shoot never mind ve are in the vay . " " And what did you say ? " " That I vill put harpoon in his behind ! " Just the Gandhi-like note I was hoping to strike . Tooki , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hundred yards off , I saw my first whale spout . Rick Renard is no pushover when it comes to the animal kingdom , but I have to admit it was a stirring sight . Even more stirring , however , is the sound of a 60millimeter Penthrite grenade harpoon penetrating the hull of your boat . I found myself on my back on the deck , covered with shards of fiberglass and Plexiglas . A leftover gene from my days as a TV reporter told me , Keep filming . Ragnar was covered with debris , but still at his station at the wheel . There was something heroic about it . He may have had his weak points , but he had the chops of a true Viking . I only wished he had n't grabbed the hand mike and let loose so many X-rated epithets . Suddenly Ragnar swung the wheel around and aimed straight at the whaler . Somehow I managed to keep shooting . The footage turned out well . It conveys what it 's like to smash into a vessel ten times bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back , which still hurts , but I think Rick Renard showed grace under pressure , especially considering that the crew of the whaler began throwing heavy objects down on us as we scraped and bumped along its hull . Johann was knocked unconscious by an empty oil drum . Tooki emerged from belowdecks covered with oil and dripping wet to report that we were taking on water at a rate deserving immediate attention ; also that the starboard engine was emitting black smoke . A vote was taken to return to shore . I calmed my nerves by shooting footage of Tooki and the bloodied Johann-now conscious again-furiously bailing amid billows of oily smoke . The police were waiting for us at the dock . They were very considerate to me personally . The one who put me in my cell said he had been to Chicago twice and had liked it very much . I gave him the name of my favorite steak place there . The U.S. embassy officer who visited me in jail , a mere five hours after I called for rescue , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa applications . " Nice of you to come so ... promptly . I know how busy you must be in Grimland , here at the epicenter of diplomacy . " " You 've broken locals laws , Mr. Renard , " he said , practically yawning . " All I 'm in a position to do is make sure that you are treated humanely and give you a list of attorneys . " " Thanks so much . I 'll be sure to note at the international press conference I 'll be holding shortly how helpful my government was after I was cast into this hellhole for the crime of trying to save a gentle giant of the deep . " He looked around the cell . It was actually pretty luxurious by penal standards , with a color TV and slippers . " Well , I hope you survive your ordeal . I understand you 're going to be released in an hour or so . Is there anything else I can do for you ? " " Yes : arrange for the repatriation of my remains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They can be supercilious , these State Department types . It probably comes from spending the whole day saying " We have no position on that . " I summoned LaMoyne to assist with the editing and the press conference . When he got his first glimpse of Ragnar on the video , he said , " Please do n't tell me that he is the object of this hagiographical exercise . " He uses these out-of-town words to annoy me . " We 've worked with worse , " I said . " When ? " We started editing . I hired a local actor to dub heroicsounding utterances to replace the forty-six times Ragnar swore on film . We left in the whaleship captain 's radio cursing . A typical snippet : Ragnar : I appeal to you in the name of humanity , spare this harmless creature ! Captain : Fuck your mother ! This is the part of public relations that I most enjoy : not making your client look good but making the other side look terrible . We added some interviews with the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , along with some stock footage of harpooned whales rolling over and dying . To my surprise , I found myself caring about the creatures . This went against Renard 's Third Rule No. 1 of public relations : " Never get emotionally involved . " By the end of the week we had a twelve-minute documentary titled Ragnarsaga : One Man 's Quest to Save His Country 's Soul . With the editing and the soundtrack , the confrontation with the whaleship was thrilling . Harpa waving good-bye from the dock brought tears to my eyes-never mind that I knew she had been yelling , " Ragnar , take your damn lithium pills or I vo n't haf sex vith you ! " After dubbing she was calling " Farewell , my brave man , my only love ! " Ragnar was scheduled to come before the magistrate the following Thursday . We got the film to the media on Monday , along with a press release that made it sound like Ragnar was about to be sentenced to life imprisonment by a corrupt judicial system that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bit of a stretch , but in public relations you sometimes have to swing to the bleachers . Grimland TV ran the tape several times . There 's not that much original programming there . We also streamed video from our Web site , www.ragnarsaga.com . On Thursday the crowd outside the courthouse was the biggest Grimland had seen since a demonstration over falling gravlax prices . LaMoyne had recruited some locals to hold up signs saying RAGNAR MUST BE FREE ! and WHALING = DEATH ! When Ragnar emerged from the car , the crowd began to chant . The perfectionist in me said , If only it could have been at night , with torches . Harpa had been peeved at me for the dubbing , but now she squeezed my hand and said , " You haf made him into hero ! " Looking at her-my gosh , she was beautifulthe thought crossed my mind that it would n't be all that tragic if the magistrate tossed Ragnar into the cooler for a while . Anders Gansevoort had ( covertly ) paid for Ragnar to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound as though the whaleship captain had been the aggressor and it was only by luck that we were attending a hearing , not a funeral . An hour later Ragnar was back on the steps of the courthouse , shaking his fist triumphantly and making a stem-winder of a speech . " What 's he saying ? " I asked Harpa . " He is making challenge to captain of valeship . " " What kind of challenge ? " " To fight vith axes . Is ancient Grimland custom , for insultings . " We hustled him out of there , but not before the challenge was captured on film by Grimland TV , which aired it that night . The captain of the whaleship-his first name was Magnus , and his surname derived from the words meaning " thorax " and " remover " - was shown saying that he would be more than happy to meet Ragnar on the field of honor and crush his skull like an egg . The magistrate thereupon issued a stern warning pointing out that gulfussfarkschnortel- the custom of settling disputes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ragnar was now a hero and Grimland had itself an anti-whaling movement . It was time for me to declare victory and go home . I booked a flight for the following day . That night there was a celebration . Grimlanders love nothing more than to light a big fire and dance and drink around it . It 's called a glugssplatt . Any excuse will do . They 're big on solstices and equinoxes . Every time there 's a solstice or an equinox , they 'll be out there lighting fires and chug-a-lugging Black Death until they pass out . Anthropologists call this atavistic behavior . ( We call it " spring break . " ) I was tired and had to pack , but I felt I should drop in . It was held on the outskirts of Kefluvik , next to a hotsprings lagoon , or hupmalaugar . The air was cold , as usual , but once you 're sufficiently drunk-which happens within minutes-you strip off your clothes and jump into the lagoon , which is not only hot but deliciously muddy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in soft , warm goo as the bottle is passed around and the firelight illuminates the upper torsos of lovely Grimland ladies . Really , when you come right down to it , a gluggsplatt is a pretty darn pleasant way of spending an evening . I was sitting in the mud feeling very mellow , looking up at the stars . LaMoyne was somewhere nearby , having struck up a conversation with a handsome Grimlander . Ragnar was in the next pool over , surrounded by female admirers . I became aware of someone sidling up to me . It was Harpa . In a situation like this , you 're not sure what to do with your eyes . It 's tricky if you have n't grown up in Grimland , where being naked in hot mud is the norm , culturally speaking . I went back to looking over at Ragnar and his entourage and tried to keep the conversation light , with witticisms on the order of " This is the life , huh ? " and " Check out those stars . " Harpa was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ragnar , who was now receiving the romantic attentions of two young women . " He 's the big man now , " she said . " Oh , he 's just enjoying his moment in the limelight . I 'm sure he 's the same old Ragnar . " " So , " she said , sliding right into my lap , " I , too , vill enjoy the limelight . " It was dawn , or what passes for dawn in Grimland , before I crawled out of the goo and went back to my hotel . I missed my flight , but it was one of the better sleeps I 've had , and the dreams were excellent . That should have been the end of it . But the patrimonial gods were not yet finished with Rick Renard . The next flight home was n't for a few days , so I decided to relax , tie up a few loose ends , see a few sights . I did not call Harpa , tempted as I was . Rick Renard may have faults , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she would put it , and I knew that her sudden attraction to me in the lagoon had been nothing more than a passing Black Death-fueled jealous impulse . I was happy to have been of service and to leave it at that . I was contentedly nursing this thought over a mini-bar beer in my room when my tranquillity was interrupted by a furious banging on the door . It was LaMoyne . He brushed past me and gave me that look he uses to convey extreme gravity . " Turn on the TV . " You could get English subtitles if you pressed the right button on the remote . Usually I ended up with French or Italian . The screen showed a dead whale lying on a wharf . I felt a pang for this magnificent creature , indignation rising in my chest . " Murderers , " I muttered . " Shut up and listen . " On came Magnus Thorax-Remover . He was pointing to the whale 's back . The camera closed in on what looked like a wire , maybe ten feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . At the other was something metal , the size and shape of a small sled . The subtitles said , " ... The object appears to be an electronic apparatus that was implanted in the whale previous to its capture ... " " Capture , " I snorted . " Cold-blooded murder of a warm-blooded- " " Rick , will you please just listen ? " The camera showed people-the kind you see on TV shows with " crime scene " in the title-gathering around the device , frowning . " ... Its origin and purposing is not at this point known . It will be taken to the National Laboratory for close examination ... " " Something fishy here , " I murmured . " It 's Grimland . Everything is fishy . " The phone rang . " Mr. Renard ? " " Yes ?

" " Along with two hundred and ninety-six million other people . " " Yes , but you have been here making a propaganda for the whale saving . " " Excuse me . I have been here consulting with Grimlanders of good conscience who feel passionate about ending the senseless slaughter of gentle giants of the deep . And about restoring Grimland to its greatness . " Silence . " So that is your comment ? " " Yes . Please quote it in its entirety . " " Well , I must ask you therefore if you are in any ways connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public relations .

" " There 's no flight for three days . " " There 's one to Aberdeen , Scotland , in four hours . I think we ought to be on it . " " Do you mean run away ? " ' ' " Those who run away today live to run away another day , ' ' " LaMoyne said . " It 's one of my favorite sayings . Suit yourself , but this strategic communicator is am-scraying . I 'll start a Free Rick Renard movement as soon as I get back . " I paced my hotel room wondering what the next step was . Renard 's Fourth Rule No. 1 of public relations is " Be pro-active .

" Ca n't make sense of it myself . But I 'd seriously consider exfiltrating yourself . " Exfiltrating ? " Anders , " I said . " Is there something you want to tell me ? " " You 've done a damn fine job over there , Rick . But it looks like we 've been compromised . " " Who 's " we ' ' ? " " No time to explain . Time to come on in from the cold .

" " Did you explain that ... the lagoon ... that it was n't my idea ? " " How can I tell him that ? He vould kill me . " I reviewed the situation . The media were asking if I was a military agent , and I was being stalked by an ax-toting , bipolar six-foot-five Viking . Not encouraging . My instinct was to get to the airport and crawl into the wheel well of the first airplane taking off . But Harpa said that her sister was out of town and she had a key to her apartment , where I could hide out until I had an evacuation plan . She dropped me off and went to check on Ragnar 's movements . The apartment was above a rave club . The water glass on the bedside table kept vibrating off the edge . It was a long night . Early the next morning I bought a still-warm copy of The Grimsbladderdag . The front page showed a photograph of me next to one of the dead whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Harpa . She 'd spent the night at a friend 's place and had the newspaper in front of her . She sounded shaky . Ragnar had called her cell in a rage several times during the night , demanding to know where I was . He 'd made quite a scene at my hotel . The good news was that he was now in police custody . Embedding an ax in a hotel front desk is , I was relieved to learn , against the law . " The headline-what does it say ? " " One of Their Vales Is Not ... Here . ' ' " Either The Grimsbladderdag did n't go in for catchy headlines , or I was missing something . Missing . " One of Their Whales Is Missing ' ' ? " I said . " Ya , that 's it . " In her halting English , Harpa gave me the gist of the article . The device attached to the whale had been examined by experts , who pronounced it an SSDD , or Sonar Signature Decoy Device-a military-issue gizmo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine . In this instance a U.S. submarine . It was to provide a decoy by fooling Russian submarines into thinking the whale was a U.S. sub , and tracking the whale instead . Then she read how I was a CIA agent who had arrived in Grimland under cover of being a public-relations man and was assigned to foment an anti-whaling movement so that the devices would not be discovered by whalers . " Oy , " I groaned . Gansevoort 's non-environmentalist manner suddenly came into focus . The duplicitous swine was CIA . " Oy ? " " An expression . It 's what some people back home say when they realize that the universe is in a conspiracy against them . Harpa , does the article say anything about the police looking for me ? " " ' He is being searched by the authorities . If you haf seen him , alert to the police . ' ' " I heard a beep on the line . " Vait moment , " she said . She came back on , a new note of alarm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of jail . Someone puts the money for to guarantee he is coming to the courthouse for- " " It 's called bail , Harpa . Not normally granted to ax-wielding homicidal psychopaths , but then I 'm sure Grimland is a model of progressive judicial standards . " So there it was : not yet 8:00 A.M. and the day already a nightmare . " Is n't there a ferry ? " I said . " A boat-the kind that carries cars-to Scotland ? " " Ya . Two times a veek . Sunday and Torsday . " Today was Torsday . It left at noon . I felt the flutter of the wings of the Angel of Hope-probably exhaust from a passing bus . " Harpa . Can you meet me ? Near the ferry dock-by the statue of Grim . Bring some food-anything but shark meat-and some warm clothing . Something to make me look like a Grimlander . Sheepskin jacket , sweater , wool cap . Rubber boots . A pipe-you know , the kind the old sailors smoke . " " You vill escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Make sure no one 's following you . And do n't go home . Do not go homer " Ya , okay , okay . " I made my way inconspicuously to the waterfront . I had a scarf , and I wrapped it around my face , which made me look like a terrorist . The ferry was loading . The boarding process seemed casual . I did n't see any police officers . There was a line of cars . A lot of the drivers had parked and gone off for coffee or , more likely , drinks . My plan-I now had one-was to get into the trunk of a car , hold the lid ajar , get out once aboard , and hunker down somewhere for an enjoyable two-day passage across the North Atlantic . It was at least preferable to freezing to death in the wheel well of a jet . I waited in the shadows of a shed fifty or so yards from the statue of Grim . A few minutes after eleven Harpa drove up . I lit out of the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot out of nowhere , headed right at me : the police , presumably . I did n't want to get Harpa in trouble , so I raced back toward the shed , the sedan in pursuit . In high school I ran the 100 in twelve seconds , but at forty-one I was no match for a Crown Victoria . I was huffing down a wet cobblestone alley that smelled of 900 years of cod guts when I heard a distinctly American voice shout " Mr. Renard ! Rick ! " I looked back , still running . Leaning out the driver 's window was the embassy guy who 'd visited me in jail . I stopped and stood there , doubled over , wheezing . He got out of the car . " Did n't mean to startle you . Come on , we need to get you out of here . " " That 's what I was trying to accomplish . " " Okay . You can stow away on a ferry in the North Atlantic or catch a private plane leaving from the Navy base in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plane , " I gasped . " Get in the back and hold the newspaper in front of your face , just like a real U.S. diplomat . I 'll be the chauffeur . " I was reaching for the door handle when I heard an unnatural roar . Ragnar stepped out of the shadows , swinging a piece of wood-not an ax , thank God . I ducked . I heard State Department shout something in Grimlandic that sounded like " Halt ! " and then the sound of wood on cranium . I swiveled and saw my knight in shining armor out cold . The last thing I remember is a piece of wood approaching the side of my own head at a velocity not recommended by trauma specialists . After I opened my eyes , it took a few minutes to get myself oriented . I was aware of various sensations : A throbbing in my head . The vibration of engines . Being cold . Fourth , being tied up . Fifth , an up-and-down movement , the kind associated with being on a boat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not remember having boarded the ferry . The sixth and final clue took the form of Ragnar , standing over me with a-I 'm using the term clinically-manic expression . He was muttering in his native tongue and , most alarming of all , tying something around my ankles . " Ragnar- " " Shut up . Make yourself vorthy . " " Vorthy ? " " Of the gods . " " Ragnar- " But he 'd disappeared forward . I was in what nautical types would call the stern of the boat . Of my boat , ironically enough . I managed to lift myself up enough to examine what he had tied around my ankles , and saw that it was what nautical types would call a line . I followed the line and saw that it was attached to what even non-nautical types would call a harpoon . I squirmed , but he 'd trussed me like a Christmas turkey . The engines slowed . I heard a muttering from the wheelhouse , and made out the word " Slagfinn " - not at all a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard a distinctive whoosh . If you have ever been on a whale-watching expedition , you may have heard it . People pay good money to experience it . To this day it turns my vertebrae to rubber . " Ragnar- " He hoisted the harpoon . When you 're about to be tethered to a whale , the central nervous system shifts into four-wheel drive . I rolled over like a dropped hot dog and rammed Ragnar in the back of the knees , knocking him off balance . He let out a fearsome growl . It was so fearsome that I entertained hopes it might persuade the whale to vamoose . But when I looked up , Ragnar was in the harpoon-launching position again . // My head was in proximity to his ankle . Normally in the course of conducting public relations I try to refrain from sinking my teeth into the people I 'm working with-though I have been tempted . But desperate times call for desperate measures . He let out an even more impressive roar . I looked up sideways with my choppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone the vivid red of his forked beard . He re-vectored the harpoon so that it was now aimed at me rather than the whale . An improvement in one sense , but on the whole a situational downtick . The moment froze . I sensed that Ragnar did not want to harpoon a fellow human being , even one who had had a little romp in the mud with his girlfriend and was currently gnawing on his lower leg . Everything went quiet in a hallucinatory kind of way . Then a female voice cried out , " Rag-narrr ! " My neurons were a little rearranged at this point . At first I thought , A mermaid ? " Rag-narrrr ! " Ragnar swiveled his head to see what was making this watery ruckus , thus aborting his shish-kebabbing of me . I relaxed my dental grip on his ankle . The voice was now jabbering away at full tilt in Grimlandic , above the sound of an outboard motor . Ragnar lowered the harpoon-an excellent development . I heard another voice , male , and then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harpa and Johann clambered aboard . Harpa was delivering what sounded like a stern lecture on the theme " Ve do not tie foreigners to vales , and ve vill take our lithium , " accompanied by a lot of kissing and hugging . Johann untied me . " Rick , are you okay ? " Harpa asked . " I 'll survive , " I said , which was the truth . We were about halfway back to shore , Harpa and Ragnar carrying on like love-sick teenagers ( I think she was trying to distract him ) when there came a sound like a million gallons of water being shoved aside . If you have not seen the conning tower of a nuclear submarine rise out of the ocean , take it from me : it is a sight . I do n't know if it 's worth the $2 **25;2393;TOOLONG price tag , but that 's another matter . At the time , I considered it worth every cent . It loomed over us like a great black hump . A hatch opened and two frogmen popped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Renard ? " said one of the frogmen , who , I happily noticed , was carrying a machine gun . " That would be me . " " Sir , compliments of Mr. Gansevoort . Will you come aboard ? " " Gladly . " Harpa gave me a big hug . " Ragnar is sorry for vot he do . " Ragnar did n't look in the least bit sorry , but he grunted something that sounded vaguely like **39;2420;TOOLONG . " You must to come back to visit us , Rick , " Harpa said . " Oh , " I said , " for sure . " It took a while to get to D.C. , what with a complicated switch of vessels somewhere off Newfoundland and then a flight off the deck of an aircraft carrier to Norfolk . Back in the office the first thing I said to LaMoyne was " No more whales " - not that I do n't have a whole new respect for blubber .
