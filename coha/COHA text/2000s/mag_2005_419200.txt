MICHAEL J. CREAN holds the record for the longest hole in one with a 517-yard ( 473-meter ) shot into the cup on July 4 , 2002 , at Denver 's Green Valley Ranch Golf Club . The title came under threat , however , on January 25 , 2004 , when the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity scored , according to principal investigator Steven W. Squyres , " a 300-million-mile interplanetary hole in one " by landing in a small equatorial crater on Mars . Teeing off from Cape Canaveral , NASA controlled its slice with a drive that followed the interplanetary fairway all the way to Mars . The bubble-wrapped ball dropped onto the Meridiani Planum apron , where it bounced 26 times , turned 90 , and rolled into the 20-meter-wide cup now known as Eagle Crater ( March issue , page 40 ) . The odds of a hole in one for any given terrestrial swing , according to the US Golf Register , are 1 in 33,000 . Some players beat the odds . In fact , two holes in one came within 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 2004 Masters Tournament in Augusta , Georgia . Norman Manley has the most holes in one with 59 perfect shots . He hit his first in 1964 and even managed four in 1979- Harold Stilson is the oldest person to sink a hole in one . He was 101 on May 16 , 2001 , when he aced the 16th hole at the Deerfield Country Club in Florida . It was his sixth , and he was puzzled by all the media fuss . With records like these , Bill Hilsheimer 's third hole in one in six months , in March 2004 , does n't seem so singular , but his handicap , the loss of his right hand in an accident years before , requires him to shoot under par with one arm . Photograph Although there is plenty of room inside Eagle Crater for the Opportunity lander ( above center ) and rover ( foreground ) , the cup does n't exceed regulation dimensions for a planetwide golf course .

A hole more than 470 yards from the tee is par 5-meaning that an expert player is expected to make the hole in five strokes under perfect playing conditions . Clearly the distance from Earth to Mars must make Eagle Crater at least par 5 . But Opportunity surprisingly hit an eagle ( two strokes under par ) with a hole in one . Perhaps Eagle Crater is par 3 and not so tough after all . Three weeks before Opportunity 's hole in one , the first stroke in NASA 's long game dropped the Spirit rover in Gusev Crater on the red planet . This could have been another ace , but Gusev Crater is the size of Connecticut and hard to miss . Spirit actually landed nearly 400 yards from a more challenging hole , Bonneville Crater , about 200 yards across . By March 11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crater , but it never dropped into the cup . Joined in team play with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , NASA is a robust competitor on the outer-space tournament circuit . More than three decades before its hole in one on Mars , NASA brought golf to the Moon . On February 6 , 1971 , after Apollo 14 commander Alan B. Shepard Jr . and astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell completed experiments and sample collecting on their second extravehicular excursion , Shepard pulled the head of " a genuine six-iron " out of his spacesuit pocket and attached it to the bottom of the long handle of a lunar-sample collector . He then extracted from another pocket a couple of golf balls that he had also smuggled to the Moon . Dropping a ball on the lunar surface for the television audience on Earth ( video stills pictured at lower right ) , but unable to grip his make-shift club with two hands due to his bulky spacesuit , Shepard took a one-armed sand-trap swing at the ball . After a few tries he hit it , but he also kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into a tiny crater about 30 yards away . Although it was an unremarkable hole in one , with it Shepard became the first and only golfer on the Moon . Shepard 's form was better for the second ball . It sailed , he asserted , " miles and miles and miles . " Lunar tournament referees , however , certified that the ball had crossed far less terrain , probably 200 to 400 yards . In a salute to Shepard 's time on the Fra Mauro driving range , the USGA Museum in Far Hills , New Jersey , now displays the space-traveling , Moonstruck six-iron club head . Lunar links are also spotlighted in the Mission Moon Golf Adventure Set , which sells for about $15 and includes a fully posable Apollo action figure , equipped with a wooden golf club and three golf balls , on a playboard that simulates the cratered surface of the Moon .

The game certainly requires skill , but luck also influences the outcome . The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship , Stephen Potter 's 1950 burlesque on winning strategies in competitive play , confirms that " fitness counts for less in golf than any other game , luck enters into every minute of the contest . " So when Opportunity knocked a hole in one into Eagle Crater , luck invaded Mars . Targeting the hematite deposits of Meridiani Planum , Opportunity was searching for evidence of open water in Mars 's past . Hematite is an iron-rich mineral that can form in liquid water , and the selection of Opportunity 's landing zone was influenced by the deposits detected by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft . With luck , NASA 's caddies advised , the rover would pitch and run within a golf cart 's range of bedrock hematite .
