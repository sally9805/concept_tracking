Headnote The manufacturing might of Saugus Iron Works helped the colony of Massachusetts take its first uncertain steps toward independence from England . In 1645 , a group of English investors sent engineer Richard Leader to the Massachusetts Bay Colony to find the ideal location for an iron works that would serve the needs of a growing settlement . Leader surveyed the region and finally settled on a bend in the Saugus River , where conditions seemed likely to guarantee a sizable return for the company . " The site is only two miles from the ocean-between the port cities of Boston and Salem-so it was easy to get raw materials in and finished products out , " says Amy Curry , park ranger and education coordinator at Saugus Iron Works National Historical Site . " Water from the Saugus River powered the waterwheels and machinery and , because the Saugus River is tidal , the change in water level allows for larger boats to come and go at certain times . " Just as important , the location offered access to raw materials like bog iron ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamps , ponds , and riverbeds , yielding a mixture of materials that contained 30-50 percent usable iron . The site was surrounded by forests , which yielded charcoal used to summon iron from the ore and shape the metal it into its final form ; workers had to cut down nearly an acre of trees a day to keep the blast furnace operating at 3,000 degrees . Finally , waterwheels converted the river 's energy into heat by powering the bellows that fanned the flames . A more ideal location for an iron works would have been hard to imagine . Today , steel and aluminum are the most common metals used in building construction , tools , and household goods , but back then iron was king . Axes , saws , garden hoes , nails , pots , and tools were all vital to the growth of the fledgling colony , and they were all made of iron . Although the metal had been forged in China hundreds of years before the creation of the Saugus Iron Works , this site was considered one of the most advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring years of training , so most of the original workers were brought from England , which introduced some challenges for the community . The Puritans had settled in the area to escape religious persecution and create a society with all of the laws and social customs that come with their faith , but the ironworkers did n't welcome these restrictions . When civil war spread throughout England , dozens of Scottish prisoners of war were sent to the iron works as indentured servants , and they often ran afoul of Puritan sumptuary laws , which mandated appropriate dress and language , and prohibited public drinking . Because few of the workers were able to read and write , much of the region 's history comes from court records , which document accusations of ironworkers " sitting and drinking on the Sabbath , from morning until evening " or " scolding and speaking opprobrious words to their neighbors , " all of which were met with suitable punishment . So why did the Puritans endure the conflict ? Simply put , iron was in demand , and iron workers were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cape Cod to England , and shipping products back and forth could take as much as six months , so anything that made life easier and supported your independence from the Mother Country was endured , " says Curry . " There were so few skilled iron workers in the colonies that workers knew they could ask for whatever pay they wanted . " In fact , the high cost of labor would be a critical reason for the ironworks ' eventual failure . With an ocean separating the workers from the investors , there were other challenges : Two sets of accounting ledgers were maintained , and accusations of embezzlement arose . Finally , after 26 years , the ironworks ceased operations . Flash forward 300 years . Archaeologist Rollin Robbins learned of the region 's history and set out to unearth remains of the former industrial giant in 1948 . Rollins found ancient waterwheels buried in mud along with remains from the blast furnace . With the help of the American Iron &; Steel Institute and the First Ironworkers Association , the facilities were reconstructed as faithfully as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service in 1969 . Saugus Iron Works has been closed in recent months for extensive work to meet federal guidelines set out in the Americans With Disabilities Act . But the site is expected to reopen this summer , with demonstrations that illustrate the work performed at Saugus generations ago ; the protective eyewear worn during blacksmithing demonstrations is among the rare detail that differs from years past . As soon as June , park rangers will once again use the same type of charcoal from the same type of trees , and tools similar to those that pounded anvils a century before there was any such thing as the United States .
