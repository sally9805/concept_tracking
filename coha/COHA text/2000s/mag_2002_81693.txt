Like many notable encounters , this one was accidental  --  a simple , unexpected meeting of ... well , rear ends . Really , it was perfect . How many times over the years had they crossed paths and thought of growling , Kiss my ass ? And here they were , Dwight Evans and Willie Randolph , posterior to posterior on one of their old battlegrounds , Yankee Stadium . // This took place last Friday , roughly two hours before the first-place Boston Red Sox and the second-place New York Yankees , baseball 's greatest rivals , were to meet for the ninth of the 19 games that their fans are being blessed with this season . Randolph , the Yankees ' third base coach and their former six-time All-Star second baseman , was standing on the pitcher 's mound , gathering the balls left scattered from his team 's batting practice session . Evans , the Red Sox hitting coach and their former three-time All-Star rightfielder , was strolling toward the hill to begin tossing BP to his club . As he was chatting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph , who was bent over at the waist . The two men turned around , and for an instant their eyes met . Then they spoke . // Evans : " Hey , Willie , how 's it going ? " // Randolph : " Pretty good ... pretty good . " // And that was that . As Randolph jogged toward the home clubhouse , he was stopped by a reporter who had witnessed the scene . Randolph shook his head and sighed . " Man , " he said , embarrassed that there 'd been a witness to the friendly exchange . " You saw that ? " // From 1976 through ' 88 , when Evans and Randolph were principals in the great rivalry at the same time , the two teams detested each other . It was n't just that the clubs were routinely clawing for American League East supremacy . ( Over those 13 seasons , the two combined for six division titles and five World Series appearances . ) No , members of each team had a genuine dislike for the other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sure they thought we all had attitudes , and we felt the same way about them . There was no talking before games , no hanging out by the batting cage . Just snarling . " // As Randolph was speaking , a familiar scene unfolded nearby that curdled his old-school blood . Two Yankees jogged alongside a couple of Red Sox , chatting like long-lost brothers . And in the outfield a gaggle of Boston pitchers exchanged pleasantries with their New York counterparts . There was laughter with backslaps and  --  egads !  --  handshakes , the byproducts of free agency run amok . " I guess it 's O.K. for me to say ' Hi ' to Dwight because he 's a coach now , " says Randolph . " But as a player I would n't even look at him . Nowadays you see Red Sox and Yankees running in the outfield , hugging each other . That bothers me , but what can I do ? Nothing 's the same anymore . Everything 's changed . " // Not everything . // For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , can own what has become one of Boston 's most popular fashion staples . On the front of the blue T-shirt BOSTON is written in large red letters . On the back there is a number 21 , with two words stenciled above the digits : CLEMENS SUCKS . // Hating the Yankees  --  and their ageless righthander , Roger Clemens  --  is still big business in Beantown , where two weeks ago vendors encircled Fenway Park like ants around a soggy apple during a four-game series against New York . In addition to anti-Rocket wear , one could purchase YANKEES SUCK bumper stickers ( $3 ) , YANKEES SUCK pins ( $5 ) and YANKEES SUCK caps ( $12 ) . The latest fashion statement was a tank top that called into question Derek Jeter 's sexuality . Those went for $15 , and they flew out of cardboard boxes . It was a warm Friday evening , and as the Red Sox scurried around their undersized clubhouse before the game , they were routinely stopped by reporters and offered the opportunity to express their contempt for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing pitcher , Clemens . There was no venom to be found . // Nevertheless , to Red Sox fans Clemens is  --  and this is no exaggeration  --  a modern-day Benedict Arnold . First he had the gall to abandon their team . ( After 13 years and 192 wins , he snubbed general manager Dan Duquette 's low-ball offer and signed as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1997 ) Two years later he committed the unforgivable sin of becoming a Yankee . ( Arriving in New York by trade , he happily signed a contract extension in 2000 . ) What 's more , Clemens is as dominant on the mound as ever . That Duquette thought Clemens to be washed up is long forgotten . Clemens is a Yankee , so he must be the villain . // To Boston players , however , Clemens remains an icon . " He 's done everything you could only dream of accomplishing , " says righthander Derek Lowe . " A lot of us are in awe of him . " // " Roger 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's done it all , and he 's done it like a professional . " // The fans and the players also diverge in their attitude toward the rivalry . Thanks to the unbalanced schedule adopted by major league baseball , the 19 meetings between Boston and New York represent the most between the two clubs in a regular season since 1960 , when they played 22 times . ( Expansion in 1961 reduced that figure to 18 , but as recently as 1999 the teams met only 12 times . ) To the dismay of old-timers like Evans and Randolph , this quickens the pulses of current players only slightly more than Playboy presents ... Star Jones . Truth be told , members of both teams would prefer to spend the early part of the season beating up on AL East bottom feeders Baltimore , Tampa Bay and Toronto , and then focusing on each other come September . ( Oddly , with more than two thirds of the season remaining , the rivals have already met 11 times and wo n't square off after a three-game series wraps up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just another series , " says New York reliever Steve Karsay , a Queens , N.Y. , native who grew up a Yankees fan . " It does n't mean that much . " // The fans disagree . After Clemens surrendered seven runs in 3 ? innings on May 24 , in a game Boston would win 9-8 , the boos and chants of " Clemens sucks ! " that accompanied his departure nearly equaled the decibel level at a DMX concert . Unlike the masses at Yankee Stadium last weekend , who jovially mocked the Red Sox with chants of " Nine-teen-eight-teen ! " ( the year the club last won a World Series ) , there is a palpable bitterness to the Boston crowds . Hanging in Fenway 's concourse is a banner celebrating Clemens 's two 20-strikeout games with the Red Sox ; by the completion of the series , it was splattered with ketchup and mustard and spittle . // Boston infielder Lou Merloni noticed the anti-New York hostility building during the second week of the season , when the Kansas City Royals came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck Knoblauch was cut loose by New York after last season , he was greeted with venomous derision every time he stepped to the plate . " Here , they do n't forget who the bad guys are , " says Merloni . " It 's sort of crazy . " // Even so , because of Babe Ruth and Bucky Dent and Bill Buckner and letdown after letdown , Bostonians are no strangers to painful disappointment . That 's why , after the Red Sox took the first two of the four-game series at Fenway , few on hand were surprised when the Yankees stole the momentum by winning the last two . In truth , however , this year 's Boston team matches up well with its counterpart . After going 5-13 versus New York in 2001 , the Red Sox won seven of the first 11 this year . Their most convincing victory came on Sunday , when three Boston players homered and righthander Frank Castillo limited the Yankees to four hits over eight innings of a 7-1 rout . After taking two of three last weekend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a two-game lead in the AL East . Boston 's 21-4 start on the road was the best ever . // While the additions of first baseman Jason Giambi ( .315 , 15 home runs , 41 RBIs ) and third baseman Robin Ventura ( .243 , 13 home runs , 37 RBIs ) , plus the continued emergence of second baseman Alfonso Soriano ( .320 , 14 home runs , 37 RBIs ) , have turned the grind-it-out Yankees into the league 's most thunderous lineup ( 91 homers , best in the majors ) , Boston has countered with a stylistic change of its own . Gone is the club that collected Popeye-armed , neckless righthanded sluggos to pound dents into the Green Monster . These Red Sox have not one but two speedy lead-off hitters ( Johnny Damon and Rickey Henderson ) , the AL 's best double-play combination ( shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and underrated second baseman Rey Sanchez ) and  --  most important  --  a dominant rotation . // Through Sunday , Burkett , Lowe and Pedro Martinez were a combined 21-2 with a 2.65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trio of starters . The shocker has been Lowe , who last year experienced the Fenway faithful 's wrath after losing his confidence , his stuff and the closer 's gig he had held for nearly three seasons . " I was pretty lost , " he says of a season in which he finished 5-10 with a 3.53 ERA . " Sometimes you get so down , you wonder how long it 'll take to return . " // During spring training new manager Grady Little figured Lowe might turn out to be a solid No. 3 or 4 starter . Instead the 29-year-old righthander was 8-2 with a 1.95 ERA , numbers that make him a candidate to start the All-Star Game . His success can be attributed to a renewed mastery of a swan-diving sinker that eats righthanders alive . " With the stuff he has , we always figured he could be a very good pitcher , " says Yankees manager Joe Torre . " But this good ? " // In Boston 's 5-2 win at Yankee Stadium last Friday , Lowe held New York scoreless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boosts a team 's confidence and plays with opponents ' minds . Yet afterward the Yankees were showering and eating and talking as if they had been bitten by a flea . In a sense , the team reflects its fans  --  or vice versa . Since 1996 , when New York went to the first of its five World Series under Torre , the Yankees have n't lost any sleep over the Red Sox , winning 45 of their 78 matchups . " We have a great deal of respect for the Red Sox , " says Yankees lefthander Sterling Hitchcock , " and I believe , because of the fans and the tradition and the geography , they make a great rival . But I would n't say anyone here thinks about it too much . " // Sure enough , the next day New York responded to Lowe 's dandy by beating the stuffing out of three relievers to win 10-2 . In rightfield the famed Bleacher Creatures made life miserable for the fearless few who ventured into enemy territory wearing Boston garb . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after the New Jersey Nets had beaten the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals , and the assaults began early . // " Let 's go , Celtics ! " // " Nine-teen-eight-teen ! " // " Trot Nixon sucks ! " // Louis Mollica , a 34-year-old cable TV technician from Brooklyn , was wearing a Yankees cap and a T-shirt with Clemens 's name and number on the back . The sun was shining . His team was rolling . " There 's no hatred here , only pity , " he said , in between chants . " Boston is like the kid in the neighborhood you used to beat up on , and he could n't fight back . They 've never stood a chance . "
