I do n't think I have an especially creepy house . It certainly ca n't compare to the house I grew up in , in Montreal , with the TV room down in the basement , past the furnace room where the previous owner was said to have hanged himself . ( Impossible to go up those stairs without running ! ) Still , it 's a long , straight staircase up to the second floor , and I suppose to a preschooler that seems pretty far away because none of my kids would spend any time up there alone until they were well into senior kindergarten . I " kept them company " while they sat on the John , and resigned myself to a ground floor full of toys , for playing in their room was not a concept they entertained . Playing underfoot in the kitchen was more what they had in mind . That 's perfectly understandable , says Diane Kashin , a professor in the School of Early Childhood Hclucation at Seneca College in Toronto . " Children this age are very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom or dad , that 's a very good thing because it shows they 've formed a strong attachment . " She goes further : " I think it 's developmentally inappropriate to expect a child this age to stay in a room alone . " Now if it were just a matter of you working away on dinner while your child draws quietly at the kitchen table , there would be no problem . But preschoolers are hungry for approval and parental involvement , and usually they want your participation as well as your company . That 's good for them , says Kashin - in fact , plenty of interaction with loving adults is essential for their development . But for a busy parent , Kashin acknowledges , " it can be very tough to find the time to nurture yourself . You nurture your children day in and day out , and you need that few minutes of peace . " So how do you buy a little peace ? Try negotiating . " You can have a conversation with them and say , " Let 's sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we 'll talk about some ideas of what you can keep doing on your own , while I read my book , ' ' " suggests Kashin . She cautions , though , that at this age children may need a fair bit of help in getting set up with an activity that will last for a while . " A lot of the toys we buy for children do n't have a lot of sustainable play value . " Once your child is able to play well with others , a visit from a compatible little friend can also free you up some , though you will obviously need to supervise and be ready to intervene . While preschoolers often need a fair bit of parental support during playdates with new friends , many can while away a couple of hours with a best buddy , needing nothing from you but a snack and occasional assistance with a cape or doll outfit . Overall , Kashin thinks we should welcome our children 's desire to stay close . " This is an age when you really get the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take that time , " she says . " The day will come when your child does n't want to leave his room . " Sidebar Alone with the Tube ? We all do it when we need a little space in our day . And early childhood education professor Diane Kashin says , as long as the TV is in " small doses , rather than it being the babysitter for three hours , " there 's a place for the 30-minute video . ( Of course , some preschoolers do n't like to watch W alone either ! ) What to watch ? You probably already have videotaped episodes of your child 's favourite TV shows . But there is also a whole world of delightful short children 's videos , from fairy tales to favourite books , just right for a coffee break and a preschooler 's attention span . If your local video store does n't offer much , check your public library , toy shop or children 's bookstore. // <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
