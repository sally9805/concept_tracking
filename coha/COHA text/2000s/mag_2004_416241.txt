More women are directing money to causes they care about , setting the stage for a new women 's movement : philanthropy . BY JOANNA L. KROTZ // American women have a long , honorable tradition of contributing to charities . Dut while mothers , wives and daughters may have nurtured the needy , supported the arts and even endowed institutions , it was fathers , husbands and male trustees who mostly controlled the purse strings . No longer . As women have increasingly earned more , built businesses and taken charge of family bequests , they 've grown both wealthier and more independent . According to the latest 1RS figures , women now make up 39 percent of the country 's 6.5 million top wealth holders , defined as adults with total assets of $625 , OUO or more . That adds up to 2.5 million women , who have combined assets of $4.2 trillion . Significantly , 42 percent of the women in this group are single or widowed . Plus , by 2050 an estimated $41 trillion is expected to pass from the oldest generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women tend to outlive men , more and more wealth every year will be concentrated in female hands . This tilt toward women-controlled wealth is producing seismic shifts in the world of giving . Starting in the late 1990s , women have been shedding the role of volunteer and putting on the mantle of philanthropist . There 's a big difference . " Charity is when you write checks for someone who comes to the door , " says Donna Hall , the executive director of the Women Donors Network ( womendonors.org ) , a group of women who each commit to give away at least $25,000 a year . " Philanthropy is when you set priorities and make a plan over a long period of time . It is venture capital in the nonprofit arena . " Women givers nowadays run the gamut of income and privilege , yet they arc alike in being hands-on and interested in social change . " More women tend to give anonymously than men , and , unlike men , women give based on their values more than their egos , " says Marcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative snapshot of these 21st-century female philanthropists . Each woman puts money where her heart directs . Each has a passion for making her donation count . THE ENTREPRENEURIAL PATRON In 2000 , when Sheila C.Johnson and her then-husband Robert sold Black Entertainment Television , the company they 'd founded , the couple split the $3 billion proceeds , making Johnson one of the richest women in the U.S. In addition to being a board member of and international spokesperson for the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children , to which she gave $500,000 this year , Johnson has established her own foundation . It has assets of $15.5 million and focuses on helping children , the arts and education . A former music teacher and an accomplished violinist , Johnson has donated millions for music , performing-arts and diversity programs in schools and colleges around the country . When Johnson decides to make a donation , she explains , " I do n't just lend my name . I get involved . " Recently she committed $7 million to the Parsons School of Design , in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its physical condition , " she says . " Here were the brightest , most passionate , most talented students and a wonderful , dedicated staff . I felt as though I would be letting those students down if I did n't help . " Johnson recommends tapping outside expertise for advice on implementing a giving plan that will deliver results . She consults with Washington , D.C. , philanthropic adviser Diana Chambers and also insists that her accountant review the financial statements of every organization she considers . THE WORKING HEIRESS Nancy Susan Reynolds , a daughter of tobacco baron R. J. Reynolds , established the Area Foundation in 1952 . Today Nancy Bagley , who is in her thirties and is the editor of Washington Life magazine , is Area 's vice president and the third generation of the family to share her grandmother 's passion for social equity and justice . With assets of $59 million , Area grants about $3 million annually . Most recently , it donated more than $400,000 to grassroots print and broadcast outlets in an effort to promote a more independent media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean air and water , alternative energy and agriculture , " says Bagley . She also personally donates in smaller ways . " It 's hard for me not to write a check for at least $100 to organizations that are grassroots and focused on systemic problems relating to specific issues I care about . I give away at least 10 percent of my annual income . " THE GIVEBACK ARTISTS Best-selling novelists Rona Jaffe ( The Room-Mating Season ) and Sara Paretsky ( Blacklist ) each support struggling women writers and , in Paretsky 's case , girls and women in other endeavors as well . More than ten years old , Jaffe 's New York foundation has a $400,000 endowment , and she makes periodic donations to it . She 'll have given $60,000 in 2004 , with grants of $10,000 apiece going to six women writers . " Most of these women are really stretched and have no time to do work or research , " says Jaffe . " The grant money allows them to write . " The foundation will hire a publicist to create local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York reception , at which they 'll meet literary agents and book publishers . In Chicago , Paretsky decided to create a private foundation in 2001 , after consulting with an adviser , Marcia Festen . " I wanted to address girls and women in the arts , sciences and sports , mostly in Chicago but not limited to that area , " says Paretsky . " Marcia scoured the country for programs I could contribute to but did n't come up with anything quite right . " Paretsky set up her own foundation , " so the money can be drained at any moment . I did n't want it to last forever . " In 2003 she gave away $77,000 . " I try to make grants of $5,000 to $15,000 each to support organizations ranging from sports camps for inner-city girls to a nonprofit publisher of books by and about women . " After once donating money to a group that aided girls but first lectured them against using contraception , Paretsky now requires that grantees be pro-choice . THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER TEAM In 1993 painter Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women artists in the Philadelphia area . She funded it from a fortune she received in the late 1980s , when the company her father founded went public . " When I first got the money , I did n't know how to handle it , " says Alter . " It took me a few years to figure it out . Since I am a woman artist , I thought it would be meaningful to try to level the playing field for other women artists . " Today the Leeway Foundation has a $17 million endowment and donates to arts programs as well as to local women artists . Recently Alter , now sixty-five , stepped aside as board president to make way for her daughter , Sara Becker , age thirty-seven . A yoga instructor , Becker has been actively involved in the foundation for nearly a decade . Over the years , the foundation has twice consulted strategic planners " to make sure that our organizational vision was n't diluted , " says Becker , especially as one generation gave way to the next . Leeway is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists to help make decisions . For organizational advice Alter and Becker recommend such groups as the Women 's Funding Network ( wfnet.org ) and the Council on Foundations ( www.cof.org ) . THE STAY-AT-HOME EXECS On Opposite coasts , Katie Grover and Susan Vlahos each built powerful careers before getting more involved in philanthropy and becoming full-time mothers . In the 1980s , as a $23,000-a-year assistant on Wall Street , Grover began donating $500 to $1,000 annually to the Ms. Foundation , which focuses on health care , economic security and safety for low-income girls and women . " As my pockets deepened , I gave more , " she says . In the mid- ' 90s , after having become a broker , Grover quit to take care of her newborn twins . Today she is a board member of the Ms. Foundation . " I went to a girls ' high school and a women 's college . I was taught to have a voice , " says Grover , now forty-seven . " That informs my giving . " She recently donated $1 million to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-one , left her job as a regional marketing director for Este Lauder in 2002 to spend more time with her children , now seventeen and twelve . Having lost her first child to leukemia fourteen years ago , Vlahos began volunteering one day a week at the children 's hospital that had cared for her son . ( When he was sick , she helped to add names to a national registry of bone-marrow donors . ) Vlahos also donates between $5,000 to $10,000 a year to various causes , mainly the Leukemia &; Lymphoma Society and the Make-A-Wish Foundation . She recently invited several women neighbors to monthly meetings to talk about how they can leverage their giving efforts . " The way people helped when I lost my son taught me to be generous , " she says . " Helping people is like throwing a pebble in a pool and seeing the ripple effect . " THE PIONEER A lawyer and longtime advocate of women 's philanthropy , Sondra Shaw-Hardy is the author , with Martha Taylor , of the field 's bible , Reinventing Fundmising : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaw-Hardy helped found the influential Women 's Philanthropy Institute ( WPI ) at Indiana University . She now promotes the power of women 's giving circles around the country , which have become the philanthropic equivalent of women 's book clubs . Shaw-Hardy has advised many such circles in the U.S. and recently wrote a handbook for the WPI about how to create one ( 317-278-8955 ; www.philan thropy.iupui.ed ) . In Traverse City , Michigan , Shaw-Hardy 's hometown , she and sixty members of a circle each donate at least $1,000 annually . They use their donations to combat domestic violence and fund scholarships . Philanthropy does n't require big bucks , points out Shaw-Hardy . Just care and planning . <p>
