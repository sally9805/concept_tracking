Is it difficult showing such raw emotions as you did in Finding Neverland ? <P> It was really tough doing the funeral scene because it was right under a flight path , so we 'd have to stop everything halfway through and then start up again . But with the other scenes , you just think that your mom 's dead and your dad 's dead , and it 's really upsetting . <P> Are you having fun filming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ? <P> Yes , it 's great because other kids are around . Sometimes you can feel a bit lonely , you know , when you 're just on your own , when you 're the only kid on a set . <P> How does Charlie differ from the character you play in Finding Neverland ? <P> Peter is really a quite unhappy , sad child . Charlie is more lighthearted . <P> How did you hear about the role of Charlie ? <P> I heard the role was coming up , so I read the book again and went along to the auditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream come true because I was quite sad when I left Finding Neverland because I thought I 'd never see Johnny Depp , who 's in both movies again . <P> Any other literary characters you 'd like to bring to life ? <P> I think it would be quite nice to just do some school for a while .  --  By Kristin Kloberdanz
