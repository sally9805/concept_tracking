God gave Norah Vincent A gift : huge feet . She wears a size 11 1/2 . Men 's 11 1/2 . That is not something she has necessarily always felt grateful for . " A lot of times I have to buy men 's shoes , " she says . But those big dogs wound up coming in handy when she spent 18 months dressing , talking , working and dating as a man . <P> Vincent did n't cross the great gender divide for the sheer fun of it . In fact , she found the experience extremely painful . " Looking back on it now , " she says , " I never would have done it if I had known what it really was . I had no idea that it would take this big a toll . " She did it in order to write a book , Self-Made Man ( Viking ; 290 pages ) , about how the other half lives . Kind of like Maureen Dowd but with research . <P> In person , Vincent is affable and articulate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologist for the patriarchy . She 's more like a neutral anthropologist , genuinely curious about what on earth could possibly make men act the way they do . Vincent does n't look especially masculine , although she is on the tall side  --  5 ft. 10 in. and lanky  --  and her voice is somewhat south of the alto range . ( And there 's the feet . ) So she created an alter ego whom she named Ned . <P> Ned looked a lot like Norah but with accessories : a sports bra to keep her breasts under wraps , a manly new flat-top haircut , a weight-lifting routine to bulk out Norah 's girly shoulders , and a prosthetic penis to fill out his/her crotch . And Vincent hired a voice coach to teach her to talk like a guy  --  slowly , with as little expression as humanly possible , keeping those emotions under wraps and the hand gestures to a minimum . <P> Ned also came with a dusting of fake stubble for Vincent 's smooth , pink , ladylike cheeks  --  " I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little hanky . I 'm sure people thought it was really affected . I was always going to the bathroom to check it . " Plus , Ned had a brand-new manly attitude . " One of the things I picked up as a man was projecting a certain confidence and authority and entitlement , " Vincent says . " As a woman , you 're often apologizing for things . " <P> For Vincent , putting on Ned 's costume almost every morning was like descending into the ocean in a bathysphere or hacking her way into the interior of the Amazon jungle , only that jungle is all around us every day . Ned took her places most women do n't go , or ca n't , or would n't if you paid them . She joined an all-male bowling league . She ordered lap dances at strip clubs . She went on an Iron John  --  style men 's retreat . She even spent three weeks in a Catholic monastery , in which she found that the ancient question " Ginger or Mary Ann ? " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you flip to first is the one about dating . Vincent speed-dated . She hit on chicks in singles bars . ( Vincent is gay , so it 's not so big a stretch as you may think . ) She went on dozens of Internet dates . Looking out from behind Ned 's stubble , she was surprised at how much sexual power women have over men , even when women may feel disempowered in other ways , and how icily they wield it . She was also surprised how tough it was to keep up the faade of bluff , jocular arrogance that both sexes demand from men at all times . " Every man 's armor is borrowed and 10 sizes too big , " she writes in Self-Made Man , " and beneath it , he 's naked and insecure and hoping you wo n't see . "
