Section : THIS VIEW OF LIFE A popular , quasi-scientific idea can be a powerful tool for injustice . <p> The Lord really put it on the line in his preface to that prototype of all prescription , the Ten Commandments : <p> for I , the Lord thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ( Exod. 20:5 ) . <p> The terror of this statement lies in its patent unfairness  --  its promise to punish guiltless offspring for the misdeeds of their distant forebears . <p> A different form of guilt by genealogical association attempts to remove this stigma of injustice by denying a cherished premise of Western thought  --  human free will . If offspring are tainted not simply by the deeds of their parents but by a material form of evil transferred directly by biological inheritance , then " the iniquity of the fathers " becomes a signal or warning for probable misbehavior of their sons . Thus Plato , while denying that children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonetheless defended the banishment of a man whose father , grandfather , and great-grandfather had all been condemned to death . <p> It is , perhaps , merely coincidental that both Jehovah and Plato chose three generations as their criterion for establishing different forms of guilt by association . Yet we have a strong folk , or vernacular , tradition for viewing triple occurrences as minimal evidence of regularity . We are told that bad things come in threes . Two may be an accidental association ; three is a pattern . Perhaps , then , we should not wonder that our own century 's most famous pronouncement of blood guilt employed the same criterion  --  Oliver Wendell Holmes 's defense of compulsory sterilization in Virginia ( Supreme Court decision of 1927 in Buck v. Bell ) : " three generations of imbeciles are enough . " <p> Restrictions upon immigration , with national quotas set to discriminate against those deemed mentally unfit by early versions of IQ testing , marked the greatest triumph of the American eugenics movement  --  the flawed hereditarian doctrine , so popular earlier in our century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Singapore 's " great marriage debate , " May 1984 ) , that attempted to " improve " our human stock by preventing the propagation of those deemed biologically unfit and encouraging procreation among the supposedly worthy . But the movement to enact and enforce laws for compulsory " eugenic " sterilization had an impact and success scarcely less pronounced . If we could debar the shiftless and the stupid from our shores , we might also prevent the propagation of those similarly afflicted but already here . <p> The movement for compulsory sterilization began in earnest during the 1890s , abetted by two major factors  --  the rise of eugenics as an influential political movement and the perfection of safe and simple operations ( vasectomy for men and salpingectomy , the cutting and tying of Fallopian tubes , for women ) to replace castration and other obvious mutilation . Indiana passed the first sterilization act based on eugenic principles in 1907 ( a few states had previously mandated castration as a punitive measure for certain sexual crimes , although such laws were rarely enforced and usually overturned by judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it provided for sterilization of afflicted people residing in the state 's " care , " either as inmates of mental hospitals and homes for the feebleminded or as inhabitants of prisons . Sterilization could be imposed upon those judged insane , idiotic , imbecilic , or moronic , and upon convicted rapists or criminals when recommended by a board of experts . <p> By the 1930s , more than thirty states had passed similar laws , often with an expanded list of so-called hereditary defects , including alcoholism and drug addiction in some states , and even blindness and deafness in others . It must be said that these laws were continually challenged and rarely enforced in most states ; only California and Virginia applied them zealously . By January 1935 , some 20,000 forced " eugenic " sterilizations had been performed in the United States , nearly half in California . <p> No organization crusaded more vociferously and successfully for these laws than the Eugenics Record Office , the semiofficial arm and repository of data for the eugenics movement in America . Harry Laughlin , superintendent of the Eugenics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tireless campaign of writing and lobbying for eugenic sterilization . He hoped , thereby , to eliminate in two generations the genes of what he called the " submerged tenth "  --  " the most worthless one-tenth of our present population . " He proposed a " model sterilization law " in 1922 , designed <p> to prevent the procreation of persons socially inadequate from defective inheritance , by authorizing and providing for eugenical sterilization of certain potential parents carrying degenerate hereditary qualities . <p> This model bill became the prototype for most laws passed in America , although few states cast their net as widely as Laughlin advised . ( Laughlin 's categories encompassed " blind , including those with seriously impaired vision ; deaf , including those with seriously impaired hearing ; and dependent , including orphans , ne'er-do-wells , the homeless , tramps , and paupers " ) Laughlin 's suggestions were better heeded in Nazi Germany , where his model act served as a basis for the infamous and stringently enforced Erbgesundheitsrecht , leading by the eve of World War II to the sterilization of some 375,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including nearly 4,000 for blindness and deafness . <p> The campaign for forced eugenic sterilization in America reached its climax and height of respectability in 1927 , when the Supreme Court , by an 8-1 vote , upheld the Virginia sterilization bill in the case of Buck v. Bell . Oliver Wendell Holmes , then in his mid-eighties and the most celebrated jurist in America , wrote the majority opinion with his customary verve and power of style . It included the notorious paragraph , with its chilling tag line , cited ever since as the quintessential statement of eugenic principles . Remembering with pride his own distant experiences as an infantryman in the Civil War , Holmes wrote : <p> We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives . It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the state for these lesser sacrifices .... It is better for all the world , if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime , or to let them starve for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from continuing their kind . The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes . Three generations of imbeciles are enough . <p> Who , then , were the famous " three generations of imbeciles , " and why should they still compel our interest ? <p> When the state of Virginia passed its compulsory sterilization law in 1924 , Carrie Buck , an eighteen-year-old white woman , was an involuntary resident at the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded . As the first person selected for sterilization under the new act , Carrie Buck became the focus for a constitutional challenge launched , in part , by conservative Virginia Christians who held , according to eugenical " modernists , " antiquated views about individual preferences and " benevolent " state power . ( Simplistic political labels do not apply in this case , and rarely do in general . We usually regard eugenics as a conservative movement and its most vocal critics as members of the left . This alignment has generally held in our own decade . But eugenics , touted in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals and numbered among its most vociferous critics groups often labeled as reactionary and antiscientific . If any political lesson emerges from these shifting allegiances , we might consider the true inalienability of certain human rights . ) <p> But why was Carrie Buck in the State Colony , and why was she selected ? Oliver Wendell Holmes upheld her choice as judicious in the opening lines of his 1927 opinion : <p> Carrie Buck is a feeble-minded white woman who was committed to the State Colony .... She is the daughter of a feeble-minded mother in the same institution , and the mother of an illegitimate feeble-minded child . <p> In short , inheritance stood as the crucial issue ( indeed as the driving force behind all eugenics ) . For if measured mental deficiency arose from malnourishment , either of body or mind , and not from tainted genes , then how could sterilization be justified ? If decent food , upbringing , medical care , and education might make a worthy citizen of Carrie Buck 's daughter , how could the State of Virginia justify the severing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of mental deficiency are passed by inheritance in family line , but most are not  --  a scarcely surprising conclusion when we consider the thousand shocks that beset fragile humans during their lives , from difficulties in embryonic growth to traumas of birth , malnourishment , rejection , and poverty . In any case , no fair-minded person today would credit Laughlin 's social criteria for the identification of hereditary **25;782;TOOLONG , the homeless , tramps , and paupers  --  although we shall soon see that Carrie Buck was committed on these grounds . ) <p> When Carrie Buck 's case emerged as the crucial test of Virginia 's law , the chief honchos of eugenics knew that the time had come to put up or shut up on the crucial issue of inheritance . Thus , the Eugenics Record Office sent Arthur H. Estabrook , their crack fieldworker , to Virginia for a " scientific " study of the case . Harry Laughlin himself provided a deposition , and his brief for inheritance was presented at the local trial that affirmed Virginia 's law and later worked its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughlin made two major points to the court . First , that Carrie Buck and her mother , Emma Buck , were feebleminded by the Stanford-Binet test of IQ , then in its own infancy . Carrie scored a mental age of nine years , Emma of seven years and eleven months . ( These figures ranked them technically as " imbeciles " by definitions of the day , hence Holmes 's later choice of words . Imbeciles displayed a mental age of six to nine years ; idiots performed worse , morons better , to round out the old nomenclature of mental deficiency . ) Second , that most feeblemindedness is inherited , and Carrie Buck surely belonged with this majority . Laughlin reported : <p> Generally feeble-mindedness is caused by the inheritance of degenerate qualities ; but sometimes it might be caused by environmental factors which are not hereditary . In the case given , the evidence points strongly toward the feeble-mindedness and moral delinquency of Carrie Buck being due , primarily , to inheritance and not to environment . <p> Carrie Buck 's daughter was then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . As I stated before , we tend ( often at our peril ) to regard two as potential accident and three as an established pattern . The supposed imbecility of Emma and Carrie might have been coincidental , but the diagnosis of similar deficiency for Vivian Buck ( made by a social worker , as we shall see , when Vivian was but six months old ) tipped the balance in Laughlin 's favor and led Holmes to declare the Buck lineage inherently corrupt by deficient heredity . Vivian sealed the pattern  --  three generations of imbeciles are enough . Besides , had Carrie not given illegitimate birth to Vivian , the issue ( in both senses ) would never have emerged . <p> Oliver Wendell Holmes viewed his work with pride . The man so renowned for his principle of judicial restraint , who had proclaimed that freedom must not be curtailed without " clear and present danger "  --  without the equivalent of falsely yelling " fire " in a crowded theater  --  wrote of his judgment in Buck v. Bell : " I felt that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> And so the case of Buck v. Bell remained for fifty years , a footnote to a moment of American history perhaps best forgotten . And then , in 1980 , it reemerged to prick our collective conscience , when Dr. K. Ray Nelson , then director of the Lynchburg Hospital where Carrie Buck was sterilized , researched the records of his institution and discovered that more than 4,000 sterilizations had been performed , the last as late as 1972 . He also found Carrie Buck , alive and well near Charlottesville , and her sister Doris , covertly sterilized under the same law ( she was told that her operation was for appendicitis ) , and now , with fierce dignity , dejected and bitter because she had wanted a child more than anything else in her life and had finally , in her old age , learned why she had never conceived . <p> As scholars and reporters visited Carrie Buck and her sister , what a few experts had known all along became abundantly clear to everyone . Carrie Buck was a woman of obviously normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Law at the University of Virginia , and a leading scholar of the Buck v. Bell case , wrote in a letter to me : <p> As for Carrie , when I met her she was reading newspapers daily and joining a more literate friend to assist at regular bouts with the crossword puzzles . She was not a sophisticated woman , and lacked social graces , but mental health professionals who examined her in later life confirmed my impressions that she was neither mentally ill nor retarded . <p> On what evidence , then , was Carrie Buck consigned to the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded on January 23 , 1924 ? I have seen the text of her commitment hearing ; it is , to say the least , cursory and contradictory . Beyond the simple and undocumented say-so of her foster parents , and her own brief appearance before a commission of two doctors and a justice of the peace , no evidence was presented . Even the crude and early Stanford-Binet test , so fatally flawed as a measure of innate worth ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carrie 's own case suffices ) but at least clothed with the aura of quantitative respectability , had not yet been applied . <p> When we understand why Carrie Buck was committed in January 1924 , we can finally comprehend the hidden meaning of her case and its message for us today . The silent key , again and as always , is her daughter Vivian , born on March 28 , 1924 , and then but an evident bump on her belly . Carrie Buck was one of several illegitimate children borne by her mother , Emma . She grew up with foster parents , J.T. and Alice Dobbs , and continued to live with them , helping out with chores around the house . She was apparently raped by a relative of her foster parents , then blamed for her resultant pregnancy . Almost surely , she was ( as they used to say ) committed to hide her shame ( and her rapist 's identity ) , not because enlightened science had just discovered her true mental status . In short , she was sent away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency ; it was always a matter of sexual morality and social deviance . The annals of her trial and hearing reek with the contempt of the well-off and well-bred for poor people of " loose morals . " Who really cared whether Vivian was a baby of normal intelligence ; she was the illegitimate child of an illegitimate woman . Two generations of bastards are enough . Harry Laughlin began his " family history " of the Bucks by writing : " These people belong to the shiftless , ignorant and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South . " <p> We know little of Emma Buck and her life , but we have no more reason to suspect her than her daughter Carrie of true mental deficiency . Their deviance was social and sexual ; the charge of imbecility was a cover-up , Mr. Justice Holmes notwithstanding . <p> We come then to the crux of the case , Carrie 's daughter , Vivian . What evidence was ever adduced for her mental deficiency ? This and only this : At the original trial in late 1924 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilhelm , social worker for the Red Cross , appeared before the court . She began by stating honestly the true reason for Carrie Buck 's commitment : <p> Mr. Dobbs , who had charge of the girl , had taken her when a small child , had reported to Miss Duke the temporary secretary of Public Welfare for Albemarle County that the girl was pregnant and that he wanted to have her committed somewhere  --  to have her sent to some institution . <p> Miss Wilhelm then rendered her judgment of Vivian Buck by comparing her with the normal granddaughter of Mrs. Dobbs , born just three days earlier : <p> It is difficult to judge probabilities of a child as young as that , but it seems to me not quite a normal baby . In its appearance  --  I should say that perhaps my knowledge of the mother may prejudice me in that regard , but I saw the child at the same time as Mrs. Dobbs ' daughter 's baby , which is only three days older than this one , and there is a very decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two weeks ago . There is a look about it that is not quite normal , but just what it is , I ca n't tell . <p> This short testimony , and nothing else , formed all the evidence for the crucial third generation of imbeciles . Cross-examination revealed that neither Vivian nor the Dobbs grandchild could walk or talk , and that " Mrs. Dobbs ' daughter 's baby is a very responsive baby . When you play with it or try to attract its attention  --  it is a baby that you can play with . The other baby is not . It seems very apathetic and not responsive . " Miss Wilhelm then urged Carrie Buck 's sterilization : " I think " she said , " it would at least prevent the propagation of her kind . " Several years later , Miss Wilhelm denied that she had ever examined Vivian or deemed the child feebleminded . <p> Unfortunately , Vivian died at age eight of " enteric colitis " ( as recorded on her death certificate ) , an ambiguous diagnosis that could mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the preventable childhood diseases of poverty ( a grim reminder of the real subject in Buck v. Bell ) . She is therefore mute as a witness in our reassessment of her famous case . <p> When Buck v. Bell resurfaced in 1980 , it immediately struck me that Vivian 's case was crucial and that evidence for the mental status of a child who died at age eight might best be found in report cards . I have therefore been trying to track down Vivian Buck 's school records for the past four years and have finally succeeded . ( They were supplied to me by Dr. Paul A. Lombardo , who also sent other documents , including Miss Wilhelm 's testimony , and spent several hours answering my questions by mail and Lord knows how much time playing successful detective in re Vivian 's school records . I have never met Dr. Lombardo ; he did all this work for kindness , collegiality , and love of the game of knowledge , not for expected reward or even requested acknowledgment . In a profession  --  academics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless priorities , this generosity must be recorded and celebrated as a sign of how things can and should be . ) <p> Vivian Buck was adopted by the Dobbs family , who had raised ( but later sent away ) her mother , Carrie . As Vivian Alice Elaine Dobbs , she attended the Venable Public Elementary School of Charlottesville for four terms , from September 1930 until May 1932 , a month before her death . She was a perfectly normal , quite average student , neither particularly outstanding nor much troubled . In those days before grade inflation , when C mean " good , 81-87 " ( as defined on her report card ) rather than barely scraping by , Vivian Dobbs received A 's and B 's for deportment and C 's for all academic subjects but mathematics ( which was always difficult for her , and where she scored D ) during her first term in Grade 1A , from September 1930 to January 1931 . She improved during her second term in 1B , meriting an A in deportment , C in mathematics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the honor roll in April 1931 . Promoted to 2A , she had trouble during the fall term of 1931 , failing mathematics and spelling but receiving A in deportment , B in reading , and C in writing and English . She was " retained in 2A " for the next term  --  or " left back " as we used to say , and scarcely a sign of imbecility as I remember all my buddies who suffered a similar fate . In any case , she again did well in her final term , with B in deportment , reading , and spelling , and C in writing , English , and mathematics during her last month in school . This offspring of " lewd and immoral " women excelled in deportment and performed adequately , although not brilliantly , in her academic subjects . <p> In short , we can only agree with the conclusion that Dr. Lombardo has reached in his research on Buck v. Bell  --  there were no imbeciles , not a one , among the three generations of Bucks . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history counts for much , but it is at least satisfying to learn that forced eugenic sterilization , a procedure of such dubious morality , earned its official justification ( and won its most quoted line of rhetoric ) on a patent falsehood . <p> Carrie Buck died last year . By a quirk of fate , and not by memory or design , she was buried just a few steps from her only daughter 's grave . In the umpteenth and ultimate verse of a favorite old ballad , a rose and a brier-the sweet and the bitter  --  emerge from the tombs of Barbara Allen and her lover , twining about each other in the union of death . May Carrie and Vivian , victims in different ways and in the flower of youth , rest together in peace .
