BLACK MOUNTAIN , NORTH CAROLINA , 2:30 EDT <p> <p> John Matherson lifted the plastic bag off the counter . <p> " You sure I have the right ones ? " he asked . <p> Nancy , the owner of the shop , Ivy Corner , smiled . " Do n't worry , John ; she already had them picked out weeks ago . Give her a big hug and kiss for me . Hard to believe she 's twelve today . " <p> John sighed and nodded , looking down at the bag , stuffed with a dozen Beanie Babies , one for each year of Jennifer 's life , which started twelve years ago this day . <p> " Hope she still wants these at thirteen , " he said . " God save me when that first boy shows up at the door wanting to take her out . " <p> The two laughed , Nancy nodding in agreement . He was already enduring that with Elizabeth , his sixteen- year- old , and perhaps for that , and so many other reasons as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag out , just for a few more days , weeks , or months the precious time all fathers remember fondly , when they still had their " little girl . " <p> It was a beautiful spring day , the cherry trees lining the street in full bloom , a light shower of pink petals drifting on the wind as he walked up the street , past Doc Kellor 's office , the antique stores , the new , rather Gothic- looking art gallery that had opened last month , the usual curio shops , and even an old- style ice- cream parlor . . . at a dollar fifty a scoop . Next up the street was Benson 's Used and Rare Books . John hesitated , wanted to go in just for a few minutes , then pulled out his cell phone to check the time . <p> Two thirty . Her bus would be rolling in at three , no time today to go in , have a cup of coffee , and talk about books and history . Walt Benson saw him , held up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head , pointed to his wrist even though he never wore a watch , and continued to walk up to the corner to where his Talon SUV was parked in front of Taylor 's Hardware and General Store . <p> John paused and looked back down the street for a moment . <p> I 'm living in a damn Norman Rockwell painting , he thought yet again , for the thousandth time . <p> Winding up here . . . he never imagined it , never planned for it , or even wanted it . Eight years back he was at the Army War College , Carlisle , PA , teaching military history and lecturing on asymmetrical warfare , and waiting to jump the hoop and finally get his first star . <p> And then two things happened . His promotion came through , with assignment to Brussels as a liaison to NATO , a rather nice posting to most likely end out his career . . . and then Mary had returned from the doctor 's several days after the promotion , her face pale , lips pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast cancer . " <p> The commandant at Carlisle , Bob Scales , an old friend who had stood as godfather for John 's Jennifer , understood the request he then laid before him . John would take the promotion , but could it be to the Pentagon ? It 'd place them nearby to Johns Hopkins , and not too far from Mary 's family . <p> It did n't work . Cutbacks were hitting as it was , oh , there was great sympathy from upstairs , but he had to take Brussels if he wanted the star and maybe a year later they 'd find a slot for him stateside . <p> After talking to Mary 's doctor . . . John resigned . He would take her back home to Black Mountain , North Carolina , which was what she wanted and the cancer treatment center at Chapel Hill would be nearby . <p> Bob 's connections were good , remarkably good , when John first mentioned Black Mountain . A single phone call was made ; the old- boy network , though disdained as politically incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . The president of Montreat College , North Carolina , in Mary 's hometown , did indeed " suddenly " need an assistant director of development . John hated development and admissions work but survived fit until finally a tenure- track professorship in history opened four years back and he was slotted in . <p> The fact that the president of the college , Dan Hunt , owed his life to Bob Scales , who had dragged him out of a minefield back in 1970 , was a definite mark in John 's favor that could not be ignored between friends . Dan had lost his leg , Bob got another of his Bronze Stars for saving him , and the two had been buddies ever since , each looking out , as well , for those whom the other cared for . <p> So Mary got to go home , after twenty years of following John from Benning , to Germany , to Okinawa , sweating out Desert Storm , from there to the Pentagon , then a year , a wonderful year , at West Point and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a history teacher , and maybe whichever bastard in the personnel office at the Pentagon had nixed John 's request to stay stateside had done him a favor . <p> So they came home to Black Mountain , North Carolina . He did not hesitate one second in granting her wish , resigning his commission and promotion and moving to this corner of the Carolina mountains . <p> He looked back down Main Street , frozen for a moment in time and memories . Mary would be gone four years next week , her last time out a slow , exhausting walk down this street , which as a girl she had run along . <p> It was indeed a Norman Rockwell town . That final walk down this street with her , everyone knew her , everyone knew what was happening , and everyone came out to say hi , to give her a hug , a kiss , all knowing it was farewell but not saying it . It was a gesture of love John would never forget . <p> He pushed the thought aside . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling up in twenty minutes . <p> He got into his Talon , started it up , turned onto State Street , and headed east . He did love the view as State Street curved through town , past yet more shops , nearly all the buildings redbrick , dating back to the turn of the century . <p> The village had once been a thriving community , part of the tuberculosis sanitarium business . When the railroad had finally pierced the mountains of western North Carolina in the early 1880s some of the first to flood in were tuberculosis victims . They came by the thousands , to the sanitariums that sprang up on every sunlit mountain slope . By the early twenties there were a dozen such institutions surrounding Asheville , the big city situated a dozen miles to the west of Black Mountain . <p> And then came the Depression . Black Mountain remained frozen in time , and then came antibiotics right after the war and the sanitariums emptied out . And all those wonderful buildings , which in other towns would have given way to shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing Black Mountain by . <p> Now there were conference centers for various churches and summer camps for kids where the sanitariums had been . His own college had been founded at such a site up in what everyone called the Cove . A small college , six hundred kids , most of them from small towns across the Carolinas and a few from Atlanta or Florida . Some of the kids were freaked out by the relative isolation , but most of them grudgingly admitted they loved it , a beautiful campus , a safe place , an old logging trail across the edge of the campus leading straight on up to Mount Mitchell , good white water nearby for kayaking , and plenty of woods to disappear into for partying for some of them , to get around the fairly strict campus rules . <p> The town itself finally revived , starting in the 1980s , but wonderfully , the charming turn- of- the- century look was maintained , and in the summer and fall the streets would be crammed with tourists and day- trippers coming up from Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowlands , joined by hundreds of summer " cottagers " who lived in the Cove , many of the cottages darn near mansions for some of the older wealth of the South . <p> That had been Mary 's family , Old South and wealth . Me-ma Jennie , Mary 's mother and Jennifer 's namesake , still hung on doggedly to their home up in the Cove , refusing to consider moving , even though " Papa " Tyler was now in a nearby nursing home , in the final stages of cancer . <p> John continued to drive east , the traffic on Interstate 40 , coming up through the Swannanoa Gap , roaring by on his left . The old- timers in the town still expressed their hatred of that " darn road . " Before it came in , Black Mountain was a sleepy southern mountain hamlet . With the road had come development , traffic , and the foods of tourists on weekends that the chamber of commerce loved and everyone else tried to tolerate . <p> Staying on the old highway that paralleled the interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , then turned right onto a dirt road that twisted up the side of a hill overlooking the town . The old mountain joke used to be " you know you 're getting directions to a mountain home when they say , ' Turn onto the dirt road . ' " <p> For a kid from New Jersey , John still got a bit of a kick out of the fact that he did indeed live in the South , on the side of a mountain , halfway up a dirt road , with a view worth a million bucks . <p> The home he and Mary had purchased was in one of the first new developments in the area . In a county where there was no zoning , the lower part of the hill had several trailers , an old shack where Connie Yarborough , a wonderful down- the- hill neighbor , still did not have electricity or town water , and next to her was an eccentric Volkswagen repair shop . . . the owner , Jim Bartlett , a true sixties throwback , his lot littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few precious VW Buses and Karmann Ghias . <p> The house ( Mary and John actually named Rivendell , because of their mutual love of Tolkien ) offered a broad sweeping view of the valley below ; the skyline of Asheville was in the distance , framed by the Great Smoky Mountains beyond , facing due west so Mary could have her sunsets . <p> When trying to describe the view he 'd just tell friends , " Check out Last of the Mohicans ; it was filmed a half hour from where we live . " <p> It was a fairly contemporary-looking type of home , high ceiling , the west wall , from bedroom across the living room to the dining area , all glass . The bed was still positioned to face the glass wall , as Mary wanted it so she could watch the outside world as her life drifted away . <p> He pulled up the drive . The two " idiots " Ginger and Zach , both golden retrievers , both beautiful- looking dogs  --  and both thicker than bricks when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stood up and barked madly , as if he were an invader . Though if he were a real invader they 'd have cowered in terror and stained the carpet as they . ed into Jennifer 's room to hide . <p> The two idiots charged through the bedroom , then out through the entryway screen door . . . the lower half of the door a charade , as the screen was gone . Put a new one in , it 'd last a few days and the idiots would charge right through it again . John had given up on that fight years ago . <p> As for actually closing the door . . . it never even crossed his mind anymore . This was Black Mountain . Strange as it seemed , folks rarely locked up , keys would be left in cars , kids did indeed play in the streets in the evening , there were parades for the Fourth of July , Christmas , and the ridiculous Pine cone Festival , complete to the crowning of a Miss Pinecone . Papa Tyler had absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on in their courtship when he proudly pulled out a photo of her , Miss Pine cone 1977 . In Black Mountain there was still an ice- cream truck that made the rounds on summer nights . . . . It was all one helluva difference from his boyhood just outside of Newark , New Jersey . <p> There was a car parked at the top of the driveway . Mary 's mother , Me-ma Jennie . <p> Me-ma Jennie was behind the wheel of her wonderful and highly eccentric 1959 Ford Edsel . Ford . . . that 's where the family money had come from , ownership of a string of car dealerships across the Carolinas dating back to Henry Ford himself . There was even a photo framed in the house up in the Cove of Mary 's great-granddad and Henry Ford at the opening of a dealership in Charlotte back before World War I. <p> Though it was n't polite to be overtly " business " in their strata and Jennie preferred the role of genteel southern lady , in her day , John knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . <p> John pulled up alongside the Edsel . Jennie put down the book she was reading and got out . <p> " Hi , Jen . " <p> She absolutely hated " Ma , " " Mother , " " Mom , " or , mortal sin of all mortal sins , " Me-ma " or " Grandma " from her Yankee son- in- law , who was definitely not her first choice for her only daughter . But that had softened with time , especially towards the end , especially when he had brought the girls back home to Jen . <p> The two got out of their cars and she held up a cheek to be kissed , her height , at little more than five foot two , overshadowed by his six- foot- four bulk , and there was a light touch of her hand on his arm and an affectionate squeeze . <p> " Thought you 'd never get here in time . She 'll be home any minute . " <p> Jen had yet to slip into the higher pitch or gravelly tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she practiced every night reciting before a mirror to keep that wonderful young woman-sounding southern lilt . It was an accent that still haunted him . The same as Mary 's when they had first met at Duke , twenty- eight years ago . At times , if Jen was in the next room and called to the girls , it would still bring tears to his eyes . <p> " We got time . Why did n't you go inside to wait ? " <p> " With those two mongrels ? The way they jump , they 'd ruin my nylons . " <p> Ginger and Zach were all over John , jumping , barking , leaping about . . . and studiously avoiding Jen . Though dumb , goldens knew when someone did n't like them no matter how charming they might be . <p> John reached in , pulled out the bag of Beanies , and , walking over to the stone wall that bordered the path to the house , began to line them up , one at a time , setting them side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she getting a bit old for that ? " <p> " Not yet , not my little girl . " <p> Jen laughed softly . <p> " You ca n't keep time back forever . " <p> " I can try , ca n't I ? " he said with a grin . <p> She smiled sadly . <p> " How do you think Tyler and I felt about you , the day you came through our door ? " <p> He reached out and gave her an affectionate touch on the cheek . <p> " You guys loved me . " <p> " You a Yankee ? Like hell . Tyler actually thought about driving you off with a shotgun . And that first night you stayed over . . . " <p> Even after all these years he found he still blushed a bit at that . Jen had caught Mary and him in a less than " proper " situation on the family room sofa at two in the morning . Though not fully improper , it was embarrassing nevertheless , and Jen had never let him live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped back , eyeballed them , like a sergeant examining a row of new recruits . The red , white , and blue " patriot " bear on the right should be in the middle of the ranks where a flag bearer might be . <p> He could hear the growl of the school bus as it shifted gears , turning off of old Route 70 , coming up the hill . <p> " Here she comes , " Jen announced excitedly . <p> Going back to the Edsel , she leaned in the open window and brought out a . at , elegantly wrapped box , tied off with a neat bow . <p> " Jewelry ? " John asked . <p> " Of course ; she 's twelve now . A proper young lady should have a gold necklace at twelve . Her mother did . " <p> " Yeah , I remember that necklace , " he said with a grin . " She was wearing it that night you just mentioned . And she was twenty then . " <p> " You cad , " Jen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he pretended that it was a painful blow . <p> Ginger and Zach had stopped jumping around John , both of them cocking their heads , taking in the sound of the approaching school bus , the squeal of the brakes as it stopped at the bottom of the driveway , its yellow barely visible now through the spring- blooming trees . <p> They were both off like lightning bolts , running full tilt down the driveway , barking up a storm , and seconds later he could hear the laughter of Jennifer ; of Patricia , a year older and their neighbor ; and of Seth , Pat 's eleventh-grade brother . <p> The girls came running up the driveway , Seth threw a stick , the two dogs diverted by it for a moment but then turned together and charged up the hill behind the girls . Seth waved then crossed the street to his house . <p> John felt a hand slip into his . . . Jen 's . <p> " Just like her mother , " Jen whispered , voice choked . <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinny as a rail , shoulder-length blond hair tied back , still a lanky little girl . She slowed a bit , reaching out to put a hand on a tree as if to brace herself , Patricia turned and waited for her . John felt a momentary concern , wanted to go down to her , but knew better , Jen actually held him back . <p> " You are too protective , " Jen whispered . " She must handle it on her own . " <p> Young Jennifer caught her breath , looked up , a bit pale , saw them waiting , and a radiant smile lit her face . <p> " Me-ma ! And you drove the Edsel today . Can we go for a ride ? " <p> Jen let her hand slip , bent over slightly as Jennifer ran up to her grandmother , the two embracing . <p> " How 's my birthday girl ? " <p> They hugged and Grandma Jen showered Jennifer with kisses , twelve of them , counting each off . Pat looked over at the Beanies lined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Afternoon , Mr. Matherson . " <p> " How are you , Pat ? " <p> " I think she needs to be checked , " Pat whispered . <p> " It can wait . " <p> " Daddy ! " <p> Jennifer was now in his arms . He lifted her up , hugged her with fierce intensity so that she laughed , then groaned , " You 'll break my back ! " <p> He let go of her , watching her eyes as she looked past him to the Beanie Babies lining the wall . . . and yes , there was still that childlike glow in them . <p> " Patriot Bear ! And Ollie Ostrich ! " <p> As she started to sweep them up , he looked over at Jen with a bit of a triumphant smile , as if to say , " See , she 's still my little girl . " <p> Jen , rising to the challenge , came up to Jennifer 's side and held out the . at box . <p> " Happy Birthday , darling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper was now a gift to her , half- swallowed it and ran off as Zach chased her . <p> When Jennifer opened the box her eyes widened . <p> " Oh , Me-ma . " <p> " It 's time my girl had a real gold necklace . Maybe your friend can help you put it on . " <p> John looked down at the gift . My God , it must of cost a fortune , heavy , almost pencil thick . Jen looked at him out of the corner of her eye as if to meet any challenge . <p> " You 're a young lady now , " Jen announced as Pat helped to clasp the necklace on , and then Jen produced a small mirror from her purse and held it up . <p> " Oh , Grandma . . . it 's lovely . " <p> " A lovely gift for a lovely lady . " <p> John stood silent for a moment , not sure what to say as his little girl gazed into the mirror , raising her head slightly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sweetie , I think you better check your blood sugar ; you seemed a bit winded coming up the hill , " John finally said , and his words came out heavily , breaking the moment . <p> " Yes , Daddy . " <p> Jennifer leaned against the wall , took off her backpack and pulled out the blood-sugar test monitor . It was one of the new digital readout models . No more finger pricking , just a quick jab to the arm . She absently fingered the necklace with her free hand while waiting for the readout . <p> One forty- two . . . a bit high . <p> " I think you better get some insulin into you , " John said . <p> She nodded . <p> Jennifer had lived with it for ten years now . He knew that was a major part of his protectiveness of her . When she was in her terrible twos and threes , it tore his heart out every time he had to prick her finger , the sight of his or Mary 's approach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctors had all said that , as quickly as possible , Jennifer had to learn to monitor herself , that John and Mary needed to step back even when she was only seven and eight to let her know her own signs , test , and medicate . Mary had handled it far better than John had , perhaps because of her own illness towards the end . Jen with her strength had the same attitude . <p> Strange . Here I am , a soldier of twenty years . Saw some action , but the only casualties were the Iraqis , never my own men . I was trained to handle things , but when it came to my daugher 's diabetes , a damn aggressive type 1 , I was always on edge . Tough , damn good at what I did , well respected by my men , and yet complete jelly when it comes to my girls . <p> " There 's a few more gifts inside , " John said . " Why do n't you girls go on in ? Once your sister gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " <p> " Oh , Dad , did n't you get Elizabeth 's message ? " <p> " What message ? " <p> " Here , silly . " <p> She reached up and . shed the cell phone out of his breast pocket , tucked in behind a pack of cigarettes . She started to pull the cigarettes out , to stomp on them or tear them up , but a look from him warned her off . <p> " Someday , Daddy , " she sighed , then taking the phone she punched a few keys and handed it back . <p> " Home late . Out with Ben , " the screen read . <p> " She texted you and me during lunch . " <p> " Texted ? " <p> " Yes , Daddy , text message , all the kids are doing it now . " <p> " What 's wrong with a phone call ? " <p> She looked at him as if he were from the antediluvian period and then headed inside . <p> " Texted ? " Jen asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jen smiled . <p> " Better start keeping a sharper watch on Elizabeth , " she said . " If that Ben Johnson has any of his grandfather 's blood in him . " <p> She chuckled as if remembering something from long ago . <p> " I do n't need to hear this . " <p> " No , you do n't , Colonel . " <p> " Actually , I kind of prefer ' Doctor , ' or ' Professor . ' " <p> " A doctor is someone who sticks things in you . A professor , well , they always struck me as a bit strange . Either rakes chasing the girls or boring , dusty types . Down here in the South , ' Colonel ' sounds best . More masculine . " <p> " Well , I am no longer in active ser vice . I am a professor , so let 's just settle for ' John . ' " <p> Jen gazed up at him for a moment , then came up to his side , stood on tiptoes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why my own little girl once fell for you , John . You 'll lose both of them soon enough to some pimply- faced boys , so do hang on to her as long as you can . " <p> " Well , you sure as hell did n't help , draping that gold necklace on her . What did it cost , a thousand , fifteen hundred ? " <p> " Roughly , but then again , no lady tells the truth when it comes to her buying jewelry . " <p> " Until the bill comes in and the husband has to pay . " <p> There was a pause . He knew he had misspoken . If he had said such a thing around Mary , she 'd have lit into him about a woman being independent and the hell with a husband handling the bills . . . and in fact she did handle all the family finances right up till the last weeks of her life . <p> As for Tyler , though , he no longer even knew what a bill was , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . <p> " I best be going , " Jen said . <p> " Sorry , I did n't mean it that way . " <p> " It 's all right , John . Let me go up to the nursing home to spend some time with Tyler and I 'll be back for the party . " <p> " Jennifer was expecting a ride in that monstrous car of yours . " <p> " The Edsel , my dear young man , was a generation ahead of its time . " <p> " And the biggest . op in the history of Ford Motors . My God , look at that grille ; it 's ugly as sin . " <p> She lightened up a bit with the banter . There were half a dozen cars in her huge garage , several newer ones but also an actual Model A , up on blocks , and , beauty of beauties , a powder blue 1965 Mustang convertible . A lot of bad memories , though , were tied to that Mustang . When John and Mary were dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car for a cruise up the Blue Ridge Parkway to Mount Mitchell and John , driving it , had rear- ended an elderly couple 's Winnebago . <p> No one was hurt , but the car was totaled and Tyler had poured thousands into getting it restored . . . and swore that no one other than him or Jen would ever drive it again . And Jen still lived by that ruling . <p> " This Edsel will run forever , my dear , and just check on eBay to see how much it 's worth . I bet a heck of a lot more than that SUV thing you 've got . " <p> He settled back against the stone wall as Jen maneuvered " the monster " around and cruised down the driveway at breakneck speed . The wall was warm from the afternoon sun . The Beanies were still there , and oh , that did hurt a bit ; at least she could have carried Patriot Bear or the ostrich in . <p> Inside he could hear Jennifer and Pat chatting away about the necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds . Britney Spears ? No , she was old stuff now , thank God . What it was he could n't tell , other than the fact that he did n't like it . Pink Floyd , some of the old stuff his parents listened to like Sinatra or Glenn Miller , or , better yet , the Chieftains were more his speed . He picked up one of the Beanies , Patriot Bear . <p> " Well , my friend , guess we 'll soon be left behind , " he said . <p> Leaning against the wall , he soaked in the view , the tranquility of the moment , broken only by the distant rumble of traffic on I-40 and the noise inside the house . <p> Ginger and Zach came back from their romp in the field behind the house and flopped down at his feet , panting hard . <p> The scent of lilacs was heavy on the air ; if anyone wanted to truly see spring , they should live in these mountains . Down in the valley below , the cherry trees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his home they were just beginning to blossom , but the lilacs were already blooming . To his right , ten miles away , the top of Mount Mitchell was actually crowned with a touch of snow , winter was still up there . <p> " When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed . . . " <p> The scent always triggered in his mind Whitman 's lament for Lincoln . It reminded John that to night , the second Tuesday of the month , was Civil War Roundtable night in the basement of the Methodist church . It 'd be another fun round of the usual raucous debate , the other members all needling him as their one and only Yankee , whom they could pick on . <p> And then the phone rang . He pulled it out of his pocket , expecting it to be Elizabeth . There was going to be hell to pay if it was . How she could stand up her kid sister on her birthday to sneak off with that pimple- faced , horny , fast- handed Johnson kid . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John recognized the next three numbers . . . the Pentagon . <p> He opened the phone and clicked it on . <p> " Hey , Bob . " <p> " John , how you doing ? Where 's my goddaughter ? " He said it doing a halfway decent imitation of Marlon Brando as Don Corleone . <p> Bob Scales , now three stars , John 's former boss at Carlisle and a damn good friend , had stood as Jennifer 's godfather , and though Irish Catholic rather than Italian , he took the job seriously . He and his wife , Barbara , usually came down three or four times a year . When Mary died they had taken a couple of weeks off and stayed to help . They never had children and thus they considered Jennifer and Elizabeth to be their surrogates . <p> " Growing up , " John said sadly . " Her grandmother gave her a gold necklace that must of cost a grand or more , which counted a helluva lot more than the Beanies , and the stack of Pokemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney World for once school lets out that I 'll give her at dinner , but I wonder now if it will be the same . " <p> " You mean when you took her there when she was six and Elizabeth ten ? Hell , yeah , it will be different , but you 'll still see the little girl come out down there , even with Elizabeth . How 's Elizabeth doing , by the way ? " <p> " I 'm thinking of shooting her boyfriend later today . " <p> Bob roared with laughter . <p> " Maybe it 's best I did n't have daughters , " Bob finally replied . " Sons , yeah . . . " <p> His voice trailed off for a moment . <p> " Hey , let me speak to Jennifer , OK ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> John walked into the house , shouting for Jennifer , who came dashing out of her bedroom , still wearing that damn necklace , and grabbed the phone . <p> " Hi , Uncle Bob ! " <p> John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your insulin ? " he asked . <p> She nodded her head ; then chattering away , she walked around the house . John looked out the window across the valley to the mountains beyond . It was a beautiful , pristine spring day . And his mood began to lighten . Several of Jennifer 's friends would be over soon for a small party . He 'd cook up some burgers on the grill out on the side deck ; the kids would then retreat to Jennifer 's room . He had just opened the pool in the backyard over the weekend , and though the water was a chilly sixty-eight , a couple of the kids might jump in . <p> He 'd flush them out around dark , go to his Roundtable meeting , and maybe later this eve ning he 'd dig back into that article he was committed to for the Civil War Journal about Lee versus Grant as a strategic commander . . . a no- brainer but still an extra five hundred bucks when done and another vita builder for tenure review next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't until eleven in the morning tomorrow . <p> " Dad , Uncle Bob wants you ! " <p> Jennifer came out of her bedroom , holding up the phone . John took it , gave her a quick peck on the top of her head and a playful swat as she ran back off . Seconds later the damn stereo in her room doubled in sound . <p> " Yeah , Bob ? " <p> " John , I got ta run . " <p> He could sense some tension in Bob 's voice . He could hear some voices in the background . . . shouting . It was hard to tell , though ; Jennifer 's stereo was blaring . <p> " Sure , Bob . Will you be down next month ? " <p> " Look , John , something 's up . Got a problem here . I got ta  --  " <p> The phone went dead . <p> At that same instant , the ceiling fan began to slowly wind down , the stereo in Jennifer 's room shut down , and looking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saver disappear , the green light of the on button on the nineteen- inch monitor disappearing . There was a chirping beep , the signal that the home security and . re alarm system was off- line ; then that went silent as well . <p> " Bob ? " <p> Silence on the other end . John snapped the phone shut . <p> Damn , power failure . <p> " Dad ? " <p> It was Jennifer . <p> " My CD player died . " <p> " Yeah , honey . " Thank God , he thought silently . " Power failure . " <p> She looked at him , a bit crestfallen , as if he were somehow responsible or could snap his finger to make the CD player come back on . Actually , if he could permanently arrange for that damn player to die , he would be tempted to do it . <p> " What about my party ? Pat just gave me a CD and I wanted to play it . " <p> " No worry , sweetie . Let me call the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picked up the landline phone . . . silence , no dial tone . <p> Last time that happened some drunk had rammed into a telephone pole down at the bottom of the hill and wiped everything out .
