DESIGN Headnote Sunset 's Flora awards honor our favorite role-players Photograph // Nearly every profession publicly honors its top performers with an award . Journalists get Pulitzers . Musicians receive Grammys . The advertising industry gives out Clios . Broadway awards Tonys ; television , Emmys . And then , of course , there 's the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ' Oscars , the most glamorous awards of all . That is , until now . We think plants that consistently put on exemplary performances should receive their own public acknowledgment . So in honor of Hollywood 's Academy Awards ceremony this month , we 're declaring our own awards : the Floras . We surveyed Sunset staffers , gardening friends , nursery experts , and landscape architects to find the best plants in each category . May we have the first envelope , please ? Best dramatic performance Angel 's trumpet ( Brugmansia ) Hollywood likes to give this award to actors like Meryl Streep who have the knack of disappearing into their roles . But we wanted the horticultural equivalent of Marilyn Monroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of attention . This stout-stemmed South American shrub has large , tropical-looking leaves , but its awesome pastel flowers are its main attraction . They 're huge ( up to 15 in. long ) , shaped like Gabriel 's trumpet , and dangle from the shrub 's branches like giant pendants . They 're also powerfully fragrant . " One plant will perfume a 50-foot-diameter space , " says garden designer Scott Spencer of Fallbrook , California . The plant can also be grown in a large container . Sunset climate zones 12 , 13 , 16-24 , H1 , and H2 . Best supporting role Pittosporum tenuifolium ' Silver Sheen ' The job of evergreen shrubs is to provide a quiet contrast to the center-stagers , and they 're content with their background role . P. tenuifolium is taller than wide ( 15 to 25 ft. tall , 10 to 15 ft. wide ) . ' Silver Sheen ' is more open than the species ; its silvery leaves are smaller . They tremble in the slightest breeze and seem to dance in the light , says landscape designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 14-17 , and 19-24 . Best visual effects ' Tropicanna ' canna In today 's movies , the most dazzling visual effects are usually generated by computers . In the garden , though , the wow power usually comes from brightly colored leaves . There has been a mini explosion of colorful subtropical foliage plants in recent years , but our favorite is a veteran player . The tiger stripes on this big-leafed canna are definitely in the Technicolor range-red , pink , yellow , and green on a purple background . The result is so visually powerful , you hardly notice that the plant also sports hot orange flowers in summer . " If you want to take someone 's breath away , plant it en masse , " designer Scott Spencer says . " It 's stunning . " Perennial in zones 6-9 , 12-24 , H1 , and H2 ; elsewhere , enjoy until frost , then dig up and store . Photograph Photograph // Best costume design Calla lily Has the Academy ever given out an award for a costume that was n't gorgeous ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they ? It is outfits like Vivien Leigh 's emerald-velvet number in Gone with the Wind that stick in the memory . Or , for that matter , Charlize Theron 's champagne sequins at last year 's Oscars . Calla lily ( Zantedeschia aethiopica ) is a plant of equal glamour . The lustrous colors and smooth texture of calla flowers are coolly elegant . But their curvy cornucopia shape and generous size ( to 8 in. deep ) are frankly voluptuous . This sophisticated combination makes callas seem high maintenance , but they 're tough as nails . " You would n't think they could handle the desert , " says Phoenix landscape architect Greg Trutza , " but give them a cool , eastern exposure , and they 're indestructible . " Callas grow from rhizomes into 2- to 5-foot-tall clumps of long-stalked , arrowhead-shaped leaves . Zones 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , /2-24 , H1 , and H2 . Photograph // Best art direction Bougainvillea A good set design conveys such a strong sense of place that viewers imagine they 're part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See them and you know you 're in the West . Bougainvillea is such a plant-forever associated with Mediterranean climates and Spanish-style homes . Bougainvillea is tough , vivid , and has a don't-mess-with-me attitude , says landscape architect Greg Trutza . Like Westerners . This vigorous ( to 30 ft. ) evergreen subtropical vine loves heat-the more the better-needs little water , and actually prefers alkaline soil . It comes in bright colors that look good in strong light , and it is thorny enough to make a great barrier plant . If frost-damaged , established plants usually grow back from their roots quickly . Reliably hardy in zones 22-24 , H1 , and H2 , but widely grown in zones 5 , 6 , 12-17 , and 19-21 in large containers that can be moved to a protected location for winter . Photograph // Best soundtrack Quaking aspen Just as music enhances a movie , sounds can make the garden experience more pleasurable . Splashing water features contribute , of course , but some plants generate their own sound effects . Quaking aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 15 to 30 ft. wide ) , is rarely silent . Its dainty leaves tremble with the slightest breeze , creating a pleasant rustling sound . Planting in small groves within enclosed spaces amplifies the rustle , says Santa Fe landscape designer Richard Wilder . Zones A1-A3 , 1-7 , and 14-19 . Lifetime achievement award Matilija poppy Hollywood hands out laurels to performers who keep producing year after year ; we decided to do the same for a flower . " Mary Elizabeth Parsons author of the 1897 book The Wild Flowers of California called the matilija poppy ' the queen of all our flowers , ' and I concur , " says Mike Evans of Tree of Life , a wholesale nursery in San Juan Capistrano , California . With huge , diaphanous white flowers atop 6- to 8-foot-tall stems , Romneya coulteri is regal , indeed . " We tell people , not entirely tongue-in-cheek , not to plant it close to busy intersections , " Evans says , " because matilija poppies definitely get attention . " Plant on slopes or isolated borders where it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and H1 . <p>
