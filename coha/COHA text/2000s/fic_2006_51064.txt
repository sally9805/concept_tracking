At the very northern edge of the Soviet Union , just west of the Kara Sea , there 's a city called Dickson , which is exactly the spot I used to focus on on the map on my bedroom wall when I was trying to fall asleep . By the time I was twelve the map had been moved to the ceiling above my bed to make room for my little sister 's posters on the more visible wall space , and then I could see even more of the details that surrounded Dickson-its neighbors , Vorontsovo and Ust ' Tareya , and the spider web of pink that I thought I could see moving along the map . Cities where I lived had names like Morrissville , Kent , and Radford . Dickson sounded to me like a place that belonged more in my world than in a northern bulge of Siberia . <p> Eventually we studied the Soviet Union in school : We talked about St. Petersburg and the czars and that woman who was wandering around claiming she was the daughter that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks we talked about the Soviet Union , and we colored in maps of Siberia , and always I 'd draw a thick blue circle on Dickson , a crumbling turquoise Crayola dot throbbing on the top of Siberia . <p> Geography became my favorite subject . History was similar , and I did well in it , but I was n't as concerned with what happened in a certain place as where exactly that certain place was . I figured out that Dickson was about eleven thousand five hundred miles from where I lived , if you went on a direct route through Quebec , went over the Atlantic and part of the Norwegian Sea , and clipped part of the green swab of Norway . <p> Johannesburg was about ten thousand miles southwest of me , according to the globe in my seventh-grade classroom . Karachi , a Pakistani city on the Arabian Sea , was just eleven thousand miles past the southeastern post of my bed . <p> Looking at maps I 'd find cities I 'd never heard of and practice spelling them to myself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the verge of waking up and having a tantrum . Maps covered my half of the room , the doors of the bathroom cabinet , my notebooks , and my locker . <p> Not long after I turned seventeen my mother scheduled a doctor 's appointment for me . October leaf mush flapped and fell off the wheel wells of the car next to us in wet brown piles on the street as we drove to the office . Pressed against the window glass , my forehead felt steamy and wet . Quiet and warm inside my mom 's car , I quizzed myself on capitals of states and foreign countries . Reading license plates provided material for my game-Minnesota , St. Paul . South Dakota , Pierre . <p> Turning off the engine when we got to the doctor 's office , my mom turned and looked at me wet-eyed and sad-like before she slung her purse over her shoulder . <p> Under fluorescent lights in the waiting room , she conferred quietly with the nurses while I read National Geographic in a corner . Violet carpeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . White walls all in the waiting room and along the hallway the nurse led me through without my mother were covered with posters of babies and women . X-ray machines , stethoscopes , tongue depressors , lollipops-these were the things I expected to see as I followed the starched white back and dark hair into a small , metallic room . <p> " You 'll need to remove all of your clothing including your brassiere and put this on with the opening in the back and put this over your lap , then please have a seat on the table here-your feet will go down here-just make yourself comfortable , and we 'll find out what 's wrong with you then , okay , sweetheart ? " <p> Zemlya George is an island north of Dickson that belonged to the U.S.S.R. , and at that moment it seemed closer and more familiar than this slab I was lying on with my feet in metal clamps and my knees begging to be reunited , unaware until a few minutes before that anything was wrong with me but remembering my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disturbed by the empty white mapless walls and the posters of women , and for the first time in my life at that moment I had no idea where in the world I was . <p> Author Affiliation
