<p> IOWA CITY  --  Brad Banks leans forward , scans the slip of paper in front of him , and wrinkles his brow in thought . <p> " Let 's see here . . . " <p> It 's a blank Heisman Trophy ballot , one of 921 that was due in New York by late Wednesday afternoon . Iowa 's senior quarterback showed up on enough of them to get an invitation to Saturday 's presentation at New York 's downtown Yale Club . But the field of contenders is so full and the race so tight that the outcome is impossible to call . <p> " If it happens , it happens , " Banks says of winning college football 's highest individual honor . " I 'm just leaving it in the hands of the Lord . " <p> Say , though , that the Lord is looking for guidance . <p> " Well , you 've got to put Brad Banks in there , " he finally offers . <p> First , second or third ? <p> " First . " <p> And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's something special . " A long pause . " And Larry Johnson . " <p> Banks leans back . When the season started , he acknowledges , neither he nor anyone could have envisioned himself in such fast company . McGahee is a star running back at Miami ( Fla. ) , which is one win from repeating last season 's national championship run . Johnson rushed for 2,000-plus yards for another glamour program , Penn State . A couple of celebrated quarterbacks , Miami 's Ken Dorsey and Southern California 's Carson Palmer , also are in the Heisman picture . <p> Banks had n't started a major-college game before taking the field Aug. 31 against Akron . He was all but anonymous another month . Now he 's the nation 's top-rated passer and cornerstone of an Iowa team that has surged with him  --  to an 11-1 record , Big Ten Conference co-championship and berth against Palmer and USC in the FedEx Orange Bowl . <p> " I think about it , and I just giggle , " Banks says . " It 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardscrabble sugar cane swamps of Belle Glade , Fla. , the youngest ( by six years ) in a melded family of 15 that includes six stepbrothers and six stepsisters . He was a hot college prospect in high school , saw his options dwindle when he failed to post high enough test scores and landed at Central Florida . <p> He never played there , let his grades slip , left after just a year and wound up in junior college . He spent a season as a receiver , was reinserted at quarterback but remained resigned to catching passes at the major-college level . That is , until Iowa got a look at him on tape . <p> A year ago Banks threw 61 passes as the Hawkeyes backup to Kyle McCann . <p> " We had a great feeling about Brad , but we did n't have a lot of evidence , " Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz says . " How 's he going to handle things in the fourth quarter ? He had n't played in a fourth quarter when it counts . Then when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bounce back ? <p> " What happens when we go into Penn State ? What happens when we go into Ann Arbor ? What happens when we go down to Purdue and it 's our last drive and we 've got to make it or we 're done ? Until you 've seen a guy operate in that arena , you 're never quite sure . " <p> They know now . Banks has thrown 25 touchdown passes this season and only four interceptions . Factor in his 60.1% completion rate and 197.4 yards a game and that 's a 166.1 passing rating , better than Palmer 's , better than Dorsey 's , better than any other quarterback 's in NCAA Division I-A . It 's the best ever at Iowa . <p> Only one Heisman-winning quarterback has finished with a higher efficiency rating : Florida 's Danny Wuerffel ( 170.6 ) in 1996 . <p> Banks also is the Hawkeyes ' third-leading rusher , with 387 yards and five touchdowns . His 30 combined touchdowns are another school record , one more than quarterback Chuck Long totaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1985 Heisman balloting . <p> That was Long 's fourth season as Iowa 's starter . <p> Banks , in the Orange Bowl , will be starting just his 13th game . " I 've said all along that I 'd not seen a player come ( from obscurity ) into his senior year as he has , " Northwestern coach Randy Walker says , " and have such a great season . " <p> Chuck Hartlieb , the former Iowa great who held the 15-year-old pass-efficiency record broken by Banks , saw him play four times . <p> " He understood when he needed to be patient in the pocket and let the play develop , and he understood when he needed to flush out and make a play on his own , " Hartlieb says . " He made great decision after great decision . <p> " I think Brad 's one of those guys who 's probably more a game-day type of player than maybe a practice player . Because if he practiced anything like he played in the games , I think the coaching staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . " <p> Surmounting the ' hump ' <p> Banks lost two costly third-quarter fumbles in Iowa 's only loss , 36-31 , to Iowa State on Sept. 14 . The Hawkeyes blew a 24-7 halftime lead . Both quarterback and team have been unassailable since . <p> At Penn State two weeks later , Banks threw for a then-career-high 261 yards and four touchdowns , including a 6-yard TD pass to C.J. Jones on the opening drive of overtime . Iowa won 42-35 . <p> Perhaps Banks ' and the Hawkeyes ' defining moment came the following Saturday against Purdue . Down 28-24 , Iowa got the ball at its 13-yard line with 2:18 left and no timeouts . Banks started an 87-yard drive with a 44-yard quarterback draw and ended it with a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Dallas Clark on fourth-and-goal  --  thrown by Banks as he was being hit . Hawkeyes win 31-28 . <p> " It told us , ' Hey , we can do anything if we want to , ' " Banks says . " I think that was our hump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Iowa then swaggered into Michigan Stadium and , in front of more than 111,000 , handed the Wolverines a 34-9 loss that was their worst at home in 35 years . Banks threw three TD passes and began a season-ending string of four games without an interception . He was 10-for-10 passing in a 62-10 rout of Northwestern on Nov. 9 , throwing and running for a total of five touchdowns . <p> With a win at Minnesota the next week , he and Iowa closed out the Hawkeyes ' first perfect Big Ten season ( 8-0 ) since 1922 . They 're No. 3 in the USA TODAY/ESPN coaches ' and Associated Press media polls and are looking at a potential No. 2 if they can beat USC in the Orange Bowl . Not since 1960 has Iowa ended a season that high . <p> Granted , it 's not all Banks ' doing . He 's operating behind one of the nation 's best offensive lines and beside a 1,200-yard rusher in Fred Russell . Complementing them is a defense allowing just 68.2 yards on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game . <p> Still , Ferentz says , " Going 11-1 and undefeated in the conference , I just ca n't imagine doing that without great quarterback play . Brad has certainly given that to us and then some . " <p> Chasing dreams into the NFL <p> Suddenly , there 's much at stake for Banks . He 'll likely get a draft-day call from the NFL in April , although when is as much a mystery as the Heisman voting . He has touch , accuracy and a good head on his shoulders , but he 's small for most pro tastes . Iowa lists his height at a modest 6-1 , which Ferentz admits is generous . <p> Banks will be a low-round pick , at best , although Ferentz predicts that via the draft or free agency " somebody is going to invest some time and see where it takes them . " <p> Ferentz points to two years ago when he stumbled across Banks . Iowa assistant Ron Aiken was recruiting a defensive lineman at Hinds ( Miss . ) Community College and was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our quarterback . <p> " Ron brought the tape in . We looked at it . And it was , ' This guy is pretty good , ' " Ferentz says . " He threw the ball well . He could run . He clearly was a good athlete . Probably the only knock you could really give him is he 's not a 6-3 guy , but in Iowa we 're not really concerned about that . We do n't have those ( height ) bars like you have at amusement parks . <p> " The bottom line is he 's a football player . If you look around the NFL right now , Drew Brees is doing pretty well . Jeff Garcia has done pretty well . There 's more to being a quarterback than being tall . " <p> Banks never had doubts . <p> " I 've always believed that I could do whatever I wanted to do , " he says , " especially when it came to sports . " <p> Even after biding his time a year ago , sitting on the Iowa bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to go out and show who 's the man , " he says . " But there was a lot said before the season , that our team was n't this and was n't that . Everybody on the team knew what we were capable of doing . And we all just sat around and talked about it and laughed  --  ( at predictions of finishing ) 10th in the conference and all that . <p> " There were a lot of people saying things about me , too . But I knew what I could do . " <p> He has left perhaps only one question , to be answered Saturday : Could he get enough of the Heisman electorate to vote with him ? <p>  --  <p> Steve Wieberg , a Heisman voter , had Palmer first , Banks second and McGahee third .
