Headnote A tiny urban backyard finds creative uses for space and materials OPEN AREAS and intimate nooks : That was what landscape architect Tomi Kobara wanted from a makeover of her Oakland garden . Part of the challenge of the transformation was the backyard 's tiny size-barely more than 1,500 square feet . As a wise first step , she created an overall plan including structure , flow , and focal points ; from there , the garden evolved . " Some areas I completed right away , others developed later , " Kobara explains . When she bought her property 6V2 years ago , a shed that served as a studio sat in the far corner of the wedge-shaped backyard . In front of it lay a concrete patio surrounded by a large lawn . Kobara wanted to further define the space but preserve play areas for her 8-year-old daughter , Izumi . She began by creating a private sanctuary at the back of the property , off the existing studio . She also cut the lawn down to roughly half its original size , leaving just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swath of green sets off the surrounding richly textured beds filled with desert spoon , euphorbias , honey bush , salvias , sedum , yucca , and a variety of other colorful perennials . Kobara then analyzed which areas still were n't working . " If you pay attention and are patient , you get a sense for what needs to happen next , " she says . The concrete pad formed a useful outdoor patio , but Kobara realized it needed more color and warmth , so she tore out the concrete and replaced it with recycled brick set in sand . Blue-green pots on the patio provide a cool counterpoint to a red trellis on the shed wall . A raised vegetable bed spans the outside edge of the brick patio . Sustainability is a theme in Kobara 's garden . Much of the material is recycled , which has led to some happy surprises . When a neighbor offered her an old playhouse , Kobara dismantled it and carried it wall by wall down the street to her backyard . The playhouse inspired her to create a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down pieces of her former concrete driveway as steppingstones . " The more we reuse and recycle , the fewer resources we deplete , including fuel to transport the goods , " she explains . Now complete , Kobara 's garden works perfectly for her family . " On the lawn , we have picnics , play catch , or set up the hose with a whirling sprinkler for Izumi and her friends , " Kobara says . " When guests come over , I set up a table for meals on the brick patio . " Judges for Sunset 's 2007 Dream Garden Awards found the backyard so appealing that they gave it an award for best use of a small space .
