Marjane Satrapi is a typical headstrong girl on the cusp of adolescence : she questions her teachers , her parents and her society . It just happens that society is a misogynistic theocracy . Persepolis ( Pantheon ; 153 pages ) is Satrapi 's memoir of growing up in a well-off progressive family in the wake of Iran 's Islamic revolution . Marjane 's mother tapes their windows ( to guard against bombs ) and covers them in black curtains ( to guard against their devout neighbors ' prying ) . Drawn in simple , bold lines with wide , inquisitive eyes , Marjane is precocious and passionate , and her small rebellions ( sneaking a cigarette ) mirror those of her liquor-drinking , dance-party-throwing parents .  --  J.P .
