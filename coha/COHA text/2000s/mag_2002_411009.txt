Section : Health &; Medicine Physicians brace for the coming siege on body and mind <p> What would have been a simple diagnosis for doctors at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital has suddenly become murky . Are the fatigue , respiratory distress , and insomnia symptoms of a viral infection that has been sending Bostonians to bed ? That 's what physicians would have assumed a month ago . But now it 's equally plausible that these same symptoms are signs of the profound psychological stress people are feeling after the recent terrorist attacks  --  attacks that involved flights out of nearby Logan Airport . Both virus and stress are going around . It 's unclear which is more virulent . <p> The terrorist acts at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are already resulting in a wave of physical and psychological complaints among Americans . For some people , the events , combined with ongoing fears about physical security , may lead to disorders ranging from ulcers and hypertension to irritable bowel syndrome , gum disease , and psoriasis . And those who are more emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trauma studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute , " are having powerful and disabling problems . We are seeing a relapse  --  in panic , in depression , in psychosis . " <p> These relapses , whether physical or emotional , appear to begin with the brain 's response to serious life stress , a response that researchers are only beginning to unravel . Danger signals coming into the body are fed into the limbic system , the brain 's emotional center , which in turn activates regions involved in the body 's fight-or-flight response . In some cases , when all systems are responding in healthy proportion , this can result in quick responses and saved lives . But the body is wired to sustain this physiological reaction for only a brief time . It 's ideal for a bear attack , or even a hurricane , but not , says James Griffith , professor of psychiatry and neurology at the George Washington University Medical Center , for this kind of threat . Because many people are n't yet confident of their own safety , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years of stress . The combination of trauma and persistent stress could lead to the exacerbation of many existing conditions , both physical and emotional . Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis may experience more pain ; asthmatics may start wheezing more . Blood pressure is also highly sensitive to chronic stress . Studies show that people who lived through traumatizing events  --  from World War II bombardments to the Three Mile Island nuclear accident  --  had higher blood pressure and elevated levels of some stress-related hormones for several years after the danger passed . <p> In many cases , the physical and psychological responses are inextricably tied together . For example , a study of teenagers who experienced the worst of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 showed that they perceived both their physical and mental health as declining , and in direct proportion to how severely their communities were damaged by the storm . Other research has shown that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder had twice as many physical ailments , such as gastrointestinal problems , as other veterans . Researchers now believe that PTSD may be a risk factor for physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rap singer used to show up in the ER 10 times a week feeling dizzy , breathless , and nauseous , as if he were having a heart attack . And 10 times a week he would be told that he was fine . In fact he was suffering from PTSD , the consequence of his mother 's and little sister 's killings by a hit-and-run driver four years before . With counseling , drugs , and ongoing support , McLeer no longer needs to race to the emergency room . Still , when he saw the World Trade Center collapse , his haunting memories returned in force . <p> Even in the best of times , it is estimated that only half of those with diagnosable mental disorders  --  22 to 23 percent of adults in America  --  seek treatment . Since the terrorist attacks , there is heightened concern about people developing full-blown mental disorders . Research in Oklahoma City after the 1995 bombing bears this out . One study found that more than half of those who became depressed had no previous history of depression ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous diagnosis . <p> Ulcers . It 's not just the heart and mind that react to stress . Fear and anger associated with loss trigger major changes in the way the stomach and colon function , what scientists now call the " brain-gut interaction . " Peptic ulcer is a leading cause of hospital admissions after a traumatic event . Most ulcers are caused by a bacterium that multiplies rapidly under high-acid conditions . " If people experience anger , as we often find after a disaster , " says Emeran Mayer , professor of medicine at UCLA , " there is stimulation of acid secretion and contractions in the stomach , and stimulation of the colon , which leads to ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome . " Mayer 's work with California earthquake victims in 1994 showed that the most severe health effects occurred later , when people were dealing with insurance companies or having to move  --  the most anger-provoking parts of the trauma . Man-made disasters , like the terrorist attacks , trigger more disease than do natural disasters . <p> Given all this bad news about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who appear to be resistant to stress 's ravages . Consider Mary Scullin , a Staten Island nurse . Her youngest brother , Stephen Siller , was one of the firefighters killed in the first hours at the World Trade Center . He left behind a wife , five children ages 9 months to 9 years , and a sprawling extended family . Scullin visited the World Trade Center with 14 family members to see where her brother was killed . " If anyone had told me that I would go and see where my brother 's body was pulverized and not fling myself to the ground , I would not think it was possible , " she says . " But it was . " <p> Among the many traits that Scullin demonstrates with these words is one that psychiatrists are particularly interested in when looking at the effects of trauma . Called resilience by some and hardiness by others , the trait appears inherent in some people . For many , the experience of a brother disappearing in flames and leaving a large young family could lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suicide . But Scullin and her family , instinctively , are responding with what researchers call " self-righting capacities "  --  strengths that individuals , families , and communities call upon to heal . With optimism , a strong support system , and a " self narrative "  --  which psychologists have found is a central component of resilience  --  their grief is not likely to become crippling in the months to come . Their brother 's life and death have become a shared family story . " I am not going to allow myself to stay in a state of powerlessness and senselessness over this event , " Scullin says . " You have to rise above it , you have to live because this horrible thing has to have a meaning . " <p> And within that statement , within these lives , are all the ingredients for becoming not the future victims of the tragedy , but survivors in the deepest sense .
