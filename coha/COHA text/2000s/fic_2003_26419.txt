Savannah Blues The rapping at the front door of the carriage house was unmistakable . Her . I could see Caroline DeSantos 's slender profile through the frosted glass inset of the front door . She had started by ringing the bell , once , twice , three times , then she began rattling the doorknob with one hand and banging at the brass knocker with the other . " Eloise ? Open up . I mean it . That beast of yours did it again . I 'm calling the dogcatcher right now . You hear me ? I 've got my cell phone . I 'm punching in the number . I know you hear me , Eloise . " She did indeed have something that looked like a phone in her hand . Jethro heard Caroline too . He raised his dark muzzle , which has endearing little spots like reverse freckles , his ears pricked up , and , recognizing the voice of the enemy , he slunk under the pine table in the living room . I knelt down and scratched his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really pee on the camellias again ? " Jethro hung his head . He 's just a stray , but he almost never lies to me , which is more than I can say for any other male I 've ever been involved with . I patted his head as a reward for his honesty . " Good dog . Help yourself . Pee on everything over there . Poop on the doorstep and I 'll buy you the biggest ham bone in Savannah . " The banging and door rattling continued . " Eloise . I know you 're home . I saw your truck parked on the street . I 've called Tal . He 's calling his lawyer . " " Tattletale , " I muttered , putting aside the box of junk I 'd been sorting . I padded toward the front door of the carriage house . The worn pine floorboards felt cool against the soles of my bare feet . Caroline was banging so hard on the door I was afraid she 'd break the etched glass panel . " Bitch , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw his tail wagging in agreement . " Slut . " More wagging . We were both gathering our resolve for the coming barrage . Jethro crawled out from under the table and sat on his haunches , directly behind me . His warm breath on my ankles felt oddly reassuring . I threw the front door open . " Sic her , Jethro , " I said loudly . " Bite the bad lady . " Caroline took half a step backward . " I heard that , " she screeched . " If that mutt puts a paw in my garden again , I 'm going to ... " " What ? " I demanded . " You 're going to what ? Poison him ? Shoot him ? Run him over in that sports car of yours ? You 'd enjoy that , would n't you , Caroline ? Running over a poor defenseless dog . " I put my hands on my hips and did a good imitation of staring her down . It was n't physically possible , of course . Caroline DeSantos stands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's without the four-inch spike heels she considers her fashion trademark . She flushed . " I 'm warning you . That 's all . For the last time . There 's a leash law in this town , as you well know . If you really loved that mutt of yours , you would n't let him run around loose all the time . " She really was quite lovely , Caroline . Even in Savannah 's ungodly summer heat , she was as crisp and fragrant as a just-plucked gardenia . Her glossy dark hair was pulled off her neck in a chignon , and her olive skin was flawless . She wore lime green linen capri slacks and a matching linen scoop-neck blouse that showed only a tasteful hint of dcolletage . I could have gone on living a long time without seeing her that way , that day . " Oh , " I said . " Jethro is running around . Is that what 's bothering you about my poor little puppy ? But you 're an expert at running around , are n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on me for at least six months before I finally wised up and kicked him out . " I 'd kicked Tal out , but he had n't gone far . The judge in our divorce case was an old family friend of Tal 's daddy , Big Tal . He 'd given our 1858 townhouse to Tal in the property settlement , and only after my lawyer raised the god-awfullest ruckus you ever heard , had he tossed me a bone  --  basically  --  awarding me the slim two-story carriage house right behind the big house . Tal installed Caroline in the big house the minute the paperwork was completed , and we 've had a running back-fence spite match ever since . My lawyer , who also happens to be my uncle James , talked himself blue in the face trying to persuade me to sell out and move , but he knows better than to try to make a Foley change her mind . On Charlton Street I 'd make my stand  --  to live and die in Dixie . Move ? Me ? No sirreebob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked me up and down and gave me a supercilious smile . It was Thursday . I 'd been up at dawn cruising the still-darkened lanes of Savannah , trying to beat the trashmen to the spoils of the town 's leading lights . I looked like hell . My junking uniform , black leggings and a blue denim work shirt , was caked in grime from the Dumpsters I 'd been digging through . My short red hair was festooned with cobwebs , my nails were broken , and peeling paint flakes clung to the back of my knuckles . The day 's pickings had been unusually slim . The two huge boxes of old books I 'd pounced on behind an Italianate brownstone on Barnard Street had yielded up mostly mildewed , totally worthless Methodist hymnbooks from the 1930s . A carton of pretty Occupied Japan dishes rescued from a pile of junk at a house on Washington Avenue had n't turned up a single ...
