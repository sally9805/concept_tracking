The future of U.S. health care must involve some form of rationing , argue a former governor and a medical-policy scholar . The problem is not simply how to control costs , but how to achieve social justice . Photograph // One of the great challenges in America 's future is to retire the baby boomers without bankrupting the country or unduly burdening future generations . This crisis could soon overwhelm American public policy , as yesterday 's baby boom becomes tomorrow 's grandparent boom . This demographic revolution raises some awesome challenges : * How can we continue to fund present programs for the elderly and also expand those programs for the aging baby boomers ? * How can we fund retirement as well as general health-care programs in an America with ever more older citizens and ever fewer children ? * How do we provide the social infrastructure for an aging society ? * And finally , how can we do politically what needs to be done while being fair to both the present generation and the future generations who will fund these programs ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepare for our future , and avoid steep economic decline . But if we wait , the decisions we will be forced to make will be truly draconian . Age could well be as divisive in the next 40 years as race and sex have been for the last . There are basically two ways to provide health care and retirement benefits for the elderly : Society can prefund these programs , much as most private-sector retirement programs are funded today , or it can develop a social-insurance scheme . The United States chose social insurance , and it has worked well so far , but how long can it continue ? The U.S. retirement system is now actuarially unsustainable , and health-care expenditures in the nation have grown over the past 40 years at about two and one-half times the rate of inflation , now consuming more than 15% of GDP . Thoughtful people are coming to realize that , given science 's seemingly endless production of new miracle treatments , the efforts expended to maintain our own aging bodies can bankrupt our children and our grandchildren . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet they get more than 60% of all federal social spending . Americans spend about three times more taxpayer funds on the elderly than on children ; the federal government 's spending is even more disproportionate . It is not a workable nation-building strategy to spend significantly more on the last generation than we do on the next generation . We must rethink many of our basic public-policy assumptions , because the status quo in health care and retirement spending is no longer an option . The only question is how much and what type of reform we need . Photograph Caring for the elderly will become a public-policy challenge to future societies with limited resources , warn authors Lamm and Blank . // The Next New Deal To admit that the current system of funding health care is unsustainable requires us to give up a cherished dream : the dream of total , universal care for any ailment freely available on demand . Like the " take backs " some employers now demand from union members , many Americans find it unacceptable to even consider renouncing benefits they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason . Reform will thus require leadership-strong bipartisan leadership , which so far has been lacking . The public already distrusts the political process , and individual citizens are wrapped up in their own needs and lives . With the nation now politically split almost down the middle on many issues , it will be hard to prepare the public for the type and magnitude of change necessary . The dominant issue in American medicine for the immediate future will be how we adjust to the demographic realities of an aging society . It will be politically and professionally painful . It will cause much agony in a medical profession trained to assume that there are virtually unlimited resources available and that cost is never a consideration . It will be a seminal issue , causing as much unsettling change as did the reform of medical education early in the twentieth century . It raises issues of limiting expectations in a society that has prided itself on setting no limits to potential in any area of life . Yet , it must be done . We simply have invented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging society can afford . We now are on the threshold of the bionic body , where medicine can have some positive impact on practically every organ . Modern medicine has outrun the ability of any nation , even a rich nation , to pay for everything beneficial to everyone within its borders . We have created a Faustian bargain , where our aging bodies can and will divert resources that our children and grandchildren need for their own families and that public policy needs for other important social goods . Americans now spend an average of more than $6,000 a year per capita on health care . For most Americans today , the largest purchase in life is no longer a house but health care . Thoughtful people may worry that we are unbalancing our economy and that it 's not wise national policy to spend $1 out of every $7 on health care , but polls show Americans believe health care to be a top priority . Most say they want to see more , not less , public spending on health care . This attitude is politically important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . But do we truly realize how our wishes impact our society and its institutions , or how they may affect our nation 's future ? seeing the Big Picture : An Expanded Vision Americans must look at today 's new demographic realities with new eyes . We must look fully and honestly at what it means to run " a nation of 50 Floridas . " British philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch wrote , " seeing is a moral art , " noting that our " moral quality functions in what we see and remember and know . " We have to morally open our eyes and gain a new moral vision for health care . This new moral vision challenges long-held assumptions of unlimited resources and ever-rising standards of living . Especially disconcerting in America 's individualistic culture is the vision 's requirement that collective societal interests be placed above the perceived interests of individuals . This new moral vision for health care must be built on the recognition that there are distinct moral duties at each of four levels of health care , and that at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four levels of moral duty are : 1 . Personal responsibility of the patient . 2 . The physician-patient relationship . 3 . Insurance company or health plan . 4 . The state and/or nation . Each of these levels in health policy has a different moral radius-i.e. , each has distinct yet overlapping moral roles . In order to address the problems facing health policy , we must examine each level of health care and how they relate to one another . All levels owe a duty to the individual patient , but not the same duty . The moral radius of a physician is almost solely to his or her patient . The moral radius of an insurance company or HMO is broader , and includes all its subscribers . The moral radius of the state or nation extends to all its citizens and must balance the good of one against the good of all . In effect , its geographic jurisdiction becomes its moral jurisdiction . The physician 's role will most likely stay substantially as it has been for 2,000 years , but neither the insurance company/HMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers . Insurance companies and governments owe a duty to the individual patient , but they also have much broader responsibilities toward a much larger group of stakeholders . It is therefore their duty to always consider costs as well as benefits-and sometimes refuse to pay-when a physician recommends a certain procedure for a specific patient . The moral radius of the plan/group requires it to maximize the health of all its members . This means saying no to marginally effective medicine . Instead , there must be fair and understandable rules and regulations that clearly aim to maximize the health of the group . Further , these rules must be intellectually sound , procedurally valid , evidence based , and well publicized to physicians and subscribers alike . Similarly , the state or nation has a duty it can not avoid : to provide basic health care for every citizen . We must start by enlarging our concept of justice to embrace the interests of all generations , including those yet to come . One great step forward taken by the New Deal was to see clearly the plight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what the solutions to past problems are doing to the future . Since World War II , many of the social policies Americans have consistently supported have encumbered the next generation . However successful and however popular our entitlement programs are , they have become unjust to our children who are paying into them . This applies with special urgency to our health-care programs . Universal Coverage : seeing The Forgotten Uninsured One often-heard argument for not changing the present U.S. healthcare system is that change would require rationing health care . In fact , the United States already does ration health care , and probably denies more people more needed care than any other industrial country . We tell ourselves that , because we are not denying specific procedures to specific individuals , we are not rationing medicine , but a health-care system rations when it fails to deliver needed services to any citizen within its jurisdiction . The sad fact is , we do n't mind people falling out of the lifeboat , so long as we do n't personally have to throw them overboard or listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " forgotten men , women , and children " who do n't have health coverage , and often , even if they are given charity treatment , receive only inadequate care . Studies show that the uninsured are less able to get adequate care , and their health statistics in virtually every category are below ( often far below ) those who have insurance . Those who must pay out of pocket often pay more than the same service would cost an insured patient , because third-party payers are able to negotiate discounted rates . Oregon sailed into terra incognita in 1989 , when it decided to limit state-funded health-care benefits rather than leave indigent Oregonians with no health coverage at all . If governments provide subsidized health care to some medically indigent citizens but not to others , they are rationing . A sustainable , publicly funded health-care system must look beyond what might be best for a single individual to ensure the justice of the system as a whole . Inevitably , this effort will require trade-offs , priority setting , and rationing-all three . In health-care policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethic . You can not build a modern health-care system one person at a time . Some institution must ask , " How do we keep a society healthy ? " We need a method of assessing health needs that looks not at individuals , but at the broader health producing possibilities . Public policy must quantify " need " cumulatively and relate that need to the real world of affordable/sustainable resources . In short , we need a public policy that values universal health-care coverage . Infinite Needs , Finite Resources Setting limits may have a strange sound to American ears , but we must have the maturity to recognize that limits are necessary . A government can not and should not allow health care to crowd out all other important social spending . The predominant characteristics of state and federal health programs , almost a unifying factor , is that they have ended up costing far more than was anticipated . We are a compassionate society and can afford a lot , but not everything . From the myriad of things medical science can do , governments must select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee for all , and provide these reliably . The price of modern medicine is honestly admitting that all health-care systems ration . Once we admit that we must set limits , the whole nature of the health-care problem changes . Limited funds must be budgeted and prioritized because every individual in the system is entitled to his or her just share of the common resources , and not only for health care , but also with regard to other necessary social goods . Today , nearly half of health care is funded by taxpayer money . Yet , just as no one person or family feels responsible for the air or water pollution of the community , people seldom consider the cumulative impact of their individual demands on public-service expenditures . Reforming American health care is a two-front war . Just as we have to restrict , we must also broaden care to improve the total health and well-being of society . Total health for any segment of society , particularly among the elderly , involves much more than we now cover under Medicare . It is imperative that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical intervention to provide services aimed at improving quality of life for seniors , not just postponing death . Examples might include programs like Meals on Wheels , health education , physician information and referral services , resource centers for elders , telephone reassurance providers , personal emergency response systems , homemaker services , transportation , and wellness programs . The challenge of providing health care to an aging society is particularly difficult because it involves downsizing citizens ' expectations ; more importantly , it also involves moral and ethical issues about life and death on which there is no national agreement . In fact , even a preliminary discussion on these issues has hardly begun . A New Framework : What It Means In Practice The proliferation of expensive medical technology and treatments today is forcing us to adopt a new moral vision . The aging of America merely accelerates this problem . With that in mind , we would suggest the following moral visions to shape a new and vigorous debate over the future of health care in the United States . A nation 's health goal can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum total of all its citizens ' individual needs . Public policy should seek a healthy public and recognize that medical care is an important part of that search , but only a part . It must find policies that maximize the health of the public , not merely respond to the medical need of certain individuals . No health-care-funding system can cover every possible treatment for every stakeholder 's ailments and anxieties . Nor is it in the public interest to fund everything that might possibly benefit a patient . The question for health-care funders is not , " What do we want ? " but " What do we need most and what can we reasonably afford ? " We do not maximize health by maximizing health care . Society must better analyze and study the factors that produce health . There is substantial evidence that medical technology is far down the list of determinants of health , behind socioeconomic and lifestyle factors . It is also clear that a number of other countries do a considerably better job in health outcomes while spending considerably less than does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending the health-care floor ( i.e. , maximizing coverage ) than raising the research ceiling . Public policy makers should be encouraged to care about the health of the total society as passionately as health-care providers care about the health of individual patients . When these conflict , it is the public health , not individual need , that must be maximized , so far as public expenditures are involved . To some degree , a two-level health-care system is inevitable since individuals have the right to spend their own money as they see fit . Thus , whatever basic level of health care that government or health plans may provide , some patients may choose to supplement that benefit by spending their own funds . This fact should not negate efforts to ration collective resources . The right to health care , then , is what philosophers refer to as a negative right to do what you will with your own resources-not a positive claim to unlimited expenditures by others . Since more than 80% of health care is paid out of commonly collected funds , and not by individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to optimize the health of all those in the group . The doctor-patient relationship is thus not the only one to consider . Doctors are good patient advocates , but they are imperfect agents to maximize the health of a group of patients , let alone society as a whole . Furthermore , when people pool funds , they can not reasonably expect to generate unlimited benefits for every member of that pool , and cost-effectiveness must be considered when distributing those funds . To that end , the U.S. legal system must be amended to recognize these realities and limit grounds for claiming malpractice when tests or treatments judged not to be cost-effective are denied . Likewise , those in health plans who distribute pooled resources have an independent ethical duty to prioritize and budget funds to maximize the overall health of the group . As former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber demands , we must pay attention to the " hydraulic relationship " among coverage , benefits , and cost . All are important ; all are interrelated . An ethical public policy must find ways to prioritize benefits covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uninsured and containing costs are not separate problems , but inextricably intertwined and must be solved together . What might ideally be considered unethical if infinite resources were available becomes ethical in the real world of finite resources . Many concepts must be reevaluated and debated anew , such as whether a society owes a greater moral duty to a 10-year-old than to a 90-year-old . To what degree must individuals bear responsibility for their own health , and when is it acceptable to deny public resources to people who cause or contribute to their own ill health ? For instance , should not people 's smoking and drinking habits over a lifetime be considered in deciding their eligibility for a high-cost rescue procedure in old age ? Life is always precious but it can not be priceless . Death always involves loss , but that loss often includes extensive public subsidy . No matter how brilliant our medicine , there will always be " ten leading causes of death . " The battle against death should not be permitted to hijack a disproportionate share of finite public resources needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Postponing death must take its place among other desirable social goals . Rebuilding the House of Health Goethe warned , " If you are going to live in your father 's house , you must rebuild it . " We have not adequately structured the house of health policy or ethics to prepare ourselves for our increasingly aging society . We have overbuilt and overfurnished the doctor/patient floor of health care and amassed an imposing economic configuration that has high stakes in maintaining it . But most of the rest of the structure remains not only unfinished but practically unframed . There are many levels of ethical analysis to consider as we frame a new health policy . Legislators , health-plan administrators , doctors , patients , and family members all have moral duties-different moral duties-and require different levels of ethical analysis that reflect their different obligations and priorities . Health policy is only one element within a social landscape of many needs . Our aging society faces three overriding public policy issues if it is to have a just and adequate healthcare system . First , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term care . second , it must balance spending for prioritized health needs , while also providing the full spectrum of other government-funded social services . Third , because rationing of some sort is inescapable , we need a rational , transparent , and workable framework within which to make our rationing decisions . The United States is not the only Western nation facing this challenge , though we are very likely in the worst position to deal with it , due to our traditional individualistic medical culture and the high public expectations it has produced . Rather than despair , however , we should view the problems raised here as a challenge . We must use the same ingenuity that gave us the New Deal and fashion a fundamentally more equitable and sustainable health-care system-one that addresses the moral needs at all levels . If we fail to adopt a broadened vision along these lines , the outlook for health care in America 's long-term future is ominous indeed . // U.S. Health Expenditures Per Capita How Americans Pay for Personal Health Care Photograph Author Affiliation About the Authors Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. presidential candidate ( Reform Party ) , is director of the Center for Public Policy and Contemporary Issues at the University of Denver , 2199 South University Boulevard , #107 , Denver , Colorado 80208 .
