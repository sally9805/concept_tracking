Democracy , as a regime type , has both structural and procedural characteristics . Structural democracy typically is rooted in constitutional guarantees or ( where there is no legally binding document on the rules of state-society relations in governance ) in common law , as is the case in the United Kingdom . Procedural democracy involves adherence to the " rules of the game , " so to speak , and at a minimum , according to Robert Dahl , involves inclusion and contestation. ( n1 ) Inclusion refers to political enfranchisement or universal suffrage  --  upholding the cardinal democratic principle that state sovereignty is vested with its citizenry . Competition simply refers to the holding of regular , free , and fair elections in the appointment of public officeholders . The regularity of competition is meant to allow for changes in accordance with the electorate 's desires . That democratic procedural minimum normally is augmented by other " soft " characteristics , which usually include civil liberties , such as freedom of expression and association , and parapolitical organizations or individuals who perform a watchdog or guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The operation of democratic governance has taken three general forms . The first , liberal democracy , is practiced widely in North America and Europe and is aimed at individual self-fulfillment within a democratic framework . The second , social or welfare democracy , is a mutation of the first and raises the importance of communal well-being over that of the individual . The third , consociational democracy , is a form of proportional representation that caters to the requirements of deeply segmented societies , in which ethno-linguistic , and often religious , pluralism is deeply embedded , as in Belgium and Switzerland. ( n3 ) Traditionally , Western political scientists have concluded that both the invocation and the operation of democracy derive from the citizenry and , in particular , from the middle classes rather than from institutional changes introduced from above . Accordingly , meaningful political participation is not viewed as a necessary derivative of institutional changes . <p> The regime-specific characteristics of democracies ( inclusion , contestation , and guarantees of civil liberties ) encountered resistance from indigenous elites in the newly independent countries of Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature on political development typically links democracy with modernization , rational-legal governance , and free-market economics , it was criticized as Western-centric , biased , and teleological and was said to ignore the specific historical and contextual circumstances of newly independent states . The literature became considerably less value laden in the 1970s , and by the 1980s broad-based developments in Eastern Europe and Asia suggested seemingly contradictory remedies . The developments that led to the collapse of communist authoritarian governments in Eastern Europe and the publication of Samuel Huntington 's work on the " third wave " of democratization revitalized the study of democracy. ( n4 ) However , the equally astounding successes of the " soft authoritarian " or semidemocratic model in parts of Asia left many perplexed. ( n5 ) Accordingly , the nature of the linkage between economic development and political liberalization was widely studied. ( n6 ) <p> The Asian economic crisis of 1997 , among other developments , led to the collapse of authoritarian government in Indonesia . Earlier , in 1992 , Thailand experienced similar events . Both countries are currently institutionalizing democratic governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach is structural institutionalization of democracy , together with an attempt to reduce the political involvement of the military . The Indonesian approach is much more procedural . The reason for the difference is embedded in the political histories of the two countries . Thailand needs to evolve structures that accommodate democratic governance ; Indonesia , having experienced democratic governance before the onset of authoritarianism , needs to correct the subversion of earlier practices . <p> In this article I examine and appraise the evolution of postauthoritarian governance in Thailand and Indonesia . The similarities between the two countries that make comparative work useful are their common location in Southeast Asia and a common historical experience of authoritarian government , as well as their recent evolution toward democracy within the last decade . A comparison of their different routes to democratic governance yields the conditions underlying the two approaches . For both procedural and substantive democracy to evolve , structural features of democracy must first be positioned so that the rules of the game become legally binding and mature. ( n7 ) It is the realization of structural deficiencies that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , which used to be all-pervasive in both societies , is addressed simultaneously . However , Thailand has generally been more responsive to pressures from below . Indonesia 's reforms appear to be of the top-down , institutionalist variety . <p> In this article I first provide a brief historical overview of developments pertaining to democratic governance in Thailand and Indonesia , culminating in the overthrow of their authoritarian governments . Next , I look at the various structures and practices that have been established to facilitate democratic governance in the two countries , and I discuss the various measures undertaken simultaneously to depoliticize the military . I then appraise the democratic developments in each country and posit that Thailand offers much brighter prospects for democratic governance than does Indonesia . Historical Background <p> Military authoritarianism as a regime type has deeper roots in Thailand than in Indonesia . The military regime in Thailand originated with the 1932 coup staged by an elite group of army officers and bureaucrats against the monarchy ; in Indonesia the military regime is a legacy of President Suharto 's New Order government , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially after World War II , was directly correlated with the emergence of the Cold War and the success of revolutionary communism on the Indochinese peninsula , which allowed for moral and material support for the military regime , as well as legitimation , from the United States . In Indonesia , on the other hand , the influence of the military in domestic politics originated with the anticolonial struggle against the Dutch before independence in 1949 . Thus the Indonesian military 's involvement in domestic politics is rooted in pre- and postindependence developments that were internally derived . <p> The early architect of military authoritarianism in Thailand was Colonel Phibun Songkram , who returned to power in 1948 after a brief period of disgrace for allowing Japanese occupation troops to use Thailand as an entry point in the war effort against British territories in Burma and Malaya . Phibun reinvigorated the military and established extensive linkages with the United States , which was concerned about the rapid spread of communism in Asia , particularly in China , Korea , and Vietnam. ( n8 ) The United States , as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used its allies in the Philippines and Thailand to forestall revolutionary communism . Thailand 's role was central to the Indochinese conflict because it was near Vietnam and also bordered on Laos and Cambodia , where communist insurgency was a potent domestic political force . Direct American involvement in the Second Indochina War , which lasted until 1975 , made Thailand a valuable strategic ally and logistical hub during the war effort. ( n9 ) <p> In view of Thailand 's strategic location and willingness to ally itself with the United States , leading figures in the military developed extensive and cordial interpersonal relations with the American political elite , which in turn offered an external basis for legitimacy as well as financial and military assistance . In addition to Phibun , Marshal Sarit Thanarat ( 1958-63 ) and Field Marshal Thanom Kittickachorn ( 1963-73 ) enjoyed such relations with the United States . Because threats to security were ideologically defined , domestic communist insurgency in the Communist Party of Thailand was also suppressed . The Thai military eventually evolved to manifest the classic characteristics of a military authoritarian regime whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n10 ) <p> During a brief democratic interlude from 1973 to 1976 , a plural multiparty democracy existed . In October 1976 the military staged a coup to return to power , citing a leftward drift in domestic politics , labor unrest , and an unfavorable external environment  --  the Communist victory in Vietnam the preceding year . Succeeding Thai governments maintained authoritarianism , although there was a significant difference in the cases of General Kriangsak Chomanand ( 1979-80 ) and General Prem Tinsulanonda ( 1980-88 ) , who preferred to step down from their military appointments before assuming a caretaker prime ministership . Political parties were allowed to emerge gradually during this period , although they generally had little bearing on the distribution of political power . This " semidemocratic " period led to the onset of democracy in the elections of August 1988 , when Chatichai Choonhavan , of the Chart Thai Party , won the prime ministership. ( n11 ) <p> The situation appeared to have stabilized in favor of democratic governance until the military , under General Suchinda Krapayoon , citing widespread corruption and the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the civilian government . The invocation of a new basis for legitimacy and intervention was surprising , although acknowledgement of rampant corruption was widespread . The king , who had a history of judicious political interventions , appointed a senior bureaucrat , Anand Panyarachun , to head a caretaker government for a year before elections were called . The military attempted to appropriate political leadership again in 1992 , leading to political violence and , ultimately , to defeat . Since then , democratic practices have been largely upheld and the military dislodged from its political role. ( n12 ) <p> By contrast , in Indonesia the traditional basis for intervention by the military ( Angkatan Bersenjata Republic Indonesia , or ABRI ) is rooted in the country 's independence struggle against the Dutch . As a result of its legitimate formation , ABRI began with a certain independence because it was not a creation of the state. ( n13 ) Its independence enabled ABRI to appropriate a political role , which it consolidated during the struggle for independence against the Dutch , from 1945 to 1949. ( n14 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parallel government in parts of Java that were not under Dutch control after the Japanese surrender . Accordingly , with time , ABRI acquired a sense of entitlement to intervene in the domestic political process and viewed itself as the embodiment of Indonesian nationalism. ( n15 ) <p> During the early period of political independence , from 1950 to 1957 , Indonesian democratic politics was intensely factional . In addition , the system of democratic representation sidelined ABRI , although leading commanders always emphasized ABRI 's legitimate role in governance. ( n16 ) When parliamentary democracy collapsed in 1957 and Indonesia was faced with regional uprisings in Sumatra and Sulawesi , ABRI had an opportunity to reclaim its lost political role . With the declaration of martial law by the Sukarno government , which lasted for the next two years , the fortunes of the military rose again , especially because the regional uprisings had to be subdued by force . During that period of political turbulence , Sukarno opted for a return to the 1945 , as opposed to the 1950 , constitution . The decision worked in ABRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional groups proscribed by statute. ( n17 ) ABRI was identified as such a group and could claim democratic political representation both ideologically and functionally . It was in this context that ABRI evolved its dwifungsi ( dual-function ) role as protector of Indonesian sovereignty and territory on the one hand and participant in domestic politics on the other . <p> The second major outbreak of political violence spanned the period from 1965 to 1967 , in the aftermath of an abortive coup attributed to the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) . After six leading generals were assassinated on 30 September 1965 , units under ABRI 's Strategic Reserve Command , led by Suharto , secured Jakarta and restored order . However , the military , aided and abetted by Muslim youth groups , systematically hunted and killed PKI members and their sympathizers who were mainly ethnic Chinese . It is estimated that as many as a half-million lives were lost during that period . The New Order government led by Suharto emerged out of this violence in 1967 . <p> With his power base firmly located within ABRI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . Structurally , this was accomplished by giving ABRI 20 percent representation ( 100 seats of 500 ) in the Legislative Assembly ( the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat , or DPR ) . The military established its own political party  --  GOLKAR ( Golongan Karya )  --  with an emasculated opposition comprising two other contenders : the United Development Party ( Partai Pembangunan Persatuan , or PPP ) and the Indonesian Democratic Party ( Partai Demokrasi Indonesia , or PDI ) . ( n18 ) With virtually no political challenge , Suharto was elected unopposed for five-year terms from 1972 until his resignation in 1998 . The territorial deployment of ABRI and the placement of senior military officers in the bureaucracy created the synergy for overwhelming influence. ( n19 ) Periodic threats to Suharto 's position were skillfully deflected through the promotion , deployment , and movement of loyal adjutants . By the 1990s , the presidency had acquired a power base independent of the military , resulting in disquiet within ABRI. ( n20 ) <p> A number of other instances of violence helped to entrench ABRI during the postindependence period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupation of East Timor in 1975 also enhanced the status of the military . Constant skirmishes with a number of separatist movements in Aceh , Timor , and West Irian further consolidated ABRI 's prestige and territorial functions . Access to lucrative contracts and monopolies allowed for economic independence as well in the resource-rich archipelago. ( n21 ) Evolution of Democratic Structures and Practices <p> Compared with Indonesia , Thailand has had certain advantages in its evolution toward democracy . Chief among those was the transition from authoritarianism in the 1970s to semidemocracy in the 1980s . The lengthy tenure of the Prem government facilitated the consolidation of certain important features of democracy , including political parties and a functioning House of Representatives . In accordance with the traditional role of interest aggregation and articulation , the political parties began to expand their spheres of interest , intruding into areas traditionally dominated by the military : foreign affairs , national security , and economic planning . Accordingly , it could be argued that Thailand had a head start vis-a-vis the evolution of democratic politics during the period immediately before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic norms was not undergirded by constitutional and rational-legal rules . When the Democratic Party 's Chuan Leekpai became the country 's prime minister after the downfall of authoritarianism , the 1991 constitution , drafted by the Suchinda government 's National Peace Keeping Council , was in place . Thus a new constitution , along with other reforms , was required to formalize the functioning of democracy . Agitation by academics , politically conscious citizens , the mass media , and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) mounted as the succeeding governments of Banham Silpa-Archa in 1995 and Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh in 1996 gravitated toward political corruption and traditional money politics . <p> Previous constitutions had simply been abrogated and rewritten by the military . As a result , there were no conventional procedures for drafting a new constitution . However , in 1996 the National Assembly , which is democratically empowered to amend the constitution , endorsed a Constitution Drafting Assembly . For the purpose of gaining well-informed yet democratic support , the 99-member assembly was constituted of 76 members representing the provinces and 23 drawn from among " political scientists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n22 ) The new constitution , which was eventually passed in October 1997 , introduced extensive amendments to existing practices , including ( a ) a mixed electoral system for selecting 500 members of parliament ( MPs ) to the Legislative Assembly ; ( b ) direct election to the Senate of nonparty candidates , who were limited to a single six-year term of office ; ( c ) the requirement that MPs resign from the assembly if appointed to the cabinet ; ( d ) the establishment of a new National Counter Corruption Commission empowered to impeach politicians and high-ranking civil servants ; and ( e ) administrative autonomy for local government . Among the softer features were guarantees of press freedoms and of civil and political rights , " including the right of the people to protect the natural resources and the cultural heritage of their communities . " ( n23 ) <p> The structural changes in the Thai constitution were meant to undergird existing democratic practices . The democratic principles of inclusion and contestation both have been maintained since 1992 ; the clearest indication of that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to represent military interests . Likewise , when Chaovalit ran for prime minister in 1996 , he did so under the banner of the New Aspiration Party . Both events clearly reflect the entrenchment of the party system for political contests , even for the military establishment . Fundamental freedoms continue to be observed , and the mass media have retained their editorial independence . Similarly , NGOs have thrived and , together with the mass media , are agents of change . <p> Unlike the Thai constitution , the existing Indonesian constitution , which was drafted in the immediate postindependence period , established the DPR and the MPR ( Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat ) , the equivalent of an electoral college . Similarly , the Indonesian state ideology of Pancasila is sufficiently accommodating to absorb and cope with diverse interests while maintaining the integrity of the state . As a result , the postauthoritarian transition has been characterized by the implementation of proper procedures that were previously subverted by Suharto . <p> The announcement and conduct of the Indonesian national election in June 1999 met with an overwhelming response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing a total of 48 registered political parties . The main contenders for power , however , were from just a few political parties . PDI-P ( Partai Demokrasi Indonesia-Perjuangan , or Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle ) , led by Megawati Sukarnoputri , took first place with some 35 percent of the total votes cast , followed by GOLKAR with 20 percent . The reformist Muslim political parties led by Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais won 16 percent and 7 percent of the vote , respectively. ( n24 ) The overall strong showing by Islamic political parties and the formation of the Muslim Axis in parliament later allowed for Abdurrahman Wahid 's election to the presidency in November 1999 . The disturbances and violence associated with the elections and the ongoing ethno-religious conflict , which continued beyond the elections , were often attributed to " dark forces "  --  invariably a reference to the maneuvers of pro-Suharto elements or to disenchantment within the military. ( n25 ) <p> It is too soon to tell whether democratic practices in Indonesia will continue in the long run . Nonetheless , political parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after having been displaced from the political scene for approximately four decades . The leading parties , however , galvanize around charismatic personalities rather than identifying themselves on the basis of political or policy preferences . Nonetheless , such gravitation is a natural feature in the evolutionary process of political parties and should perhaps be judged with restraint . Existing parties will certainly not give up the political role that they have won unless authoritarianism returns . <p> Fundamental liberties have indeed been restored by the post-Suharto government . Large numbers of political detainees , some imprisoned since 1967 , have been released , and the restrictions imposed on freedom of speech and association have been lifted . Publications that were banned in the early 1990s are back in circulation , and NGOs have begun to establish a greater presence . The National Commission on Human Rights and the attorney general 's office are now important in curtailing corruption and restraining extrajudicial processes . The socioeconomic impact of the Asian financial crisis , however , continues to linger , and the difficulties deriving from structural economic adjustments have denied Indonesia the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Along with the introduction of measures to entrench democracy in Thailand and Indonesia , the political elites of both countries have attempted to return the military to a more professional role , away from involvement in domestic politics . Those attempts are commensurate with the desire to establish " objective civilian control " of the military  --  a cardinal feature of the restoration of proper equilibrium to civil-military relations as identified by theorists of democratic governance. ( n26 ) Arguably , Thailand has had certain geostrategic as well as time advantages : Revolutionary communism has dissipated in the Indochinese peninsula , and the last abortive coup took place some eight years ago . Indonesia has had less time to control military involvement in politics , although Suharto 's attempts to distance the presidency from the military in the 1990s also contributed indirectly to the weakening of ABRI 's involvement in domestic politics . <p> In Thailand the threats of revolutionary communism originating in Vietnam and of domestic communist insurgency constituted the primary basis of legitimacy for military involvement in domestic politics . The dissipation of the threat  --  reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Soviet aid to Vietnam ) and in Vietnam 's decision to withdraw its occupation forces from Cambodia in September 1989  --  effectively denied the military that basis for legitimacy . A year earlier ( in August 1988 ) , the Prem government had collapsed and Chatichai Choonhavan had been democratically elected as prime minister . The interactive effect between those domestic and external developments not only deprived the Thai military of political legitimacy but , more important , allowed for gradually increasing civilian control over foreign policy and defense  --  two areas that traditionally impinged on state sovereignty . In addition , Thailand , unlike Indonesia , has a functionally discrete Ministry of the Interior responsible for the administration of the country . As a result , the territorial and administrative legitimacy that ABRI has maintained in Indonesia has no corollary Thailand . <p> Over and above these developments , Thailand has undertaken a series of political and administrative reforms aimed at weakening the military . The gravitation of power from the Senate to the Legislative Assembly is one such reform . Previously , active and retired military officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speaker of Parliament was often drawn from the Senate . The new constitution prevents the military from exercising such discretionary privilege . The appointment of senior military officers to lucrative directorships in state agencies has also been discontinued . For example , in the past , leading officers from the Royal Thai Air Force were automatically appointed to the board of the country 's civilian air carrier , Thai International . <p> Other areas in which the Thai military has lost control are budget allocation , arms procurement , and senior military appointments . The military previously had access to budget allocations , including a secret budget that was not subject to civilian audit . In addition , lucrative kickbacks were obtained through equipment procurement . That source of revenue has been significantly weakened , and procurements are subject to greater scrutiny and severe reductions . As a result of the Asian financial crisis , a number of intended procurements have been shelved indefinitely , including the purchase of F-18 fighter aircraft , submarines , and air-to-air missiles. ( n27 ) Finally , civilian governments , especially those led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward , have been actively involved in the appointment of senior military commanders . The most recent appointees have vowed to professionalize the military and to refrain from involvement in domestic politics . The current armed forces commander , General Surayud Cholanont , and his predecessor , General Cheta Thanajaro , have made such commitments publicly . <p> In the case of Indonesia , the initial attempts to weaken ABRI actually were undertaken by Suharto in the 1990s . Early attempts to weaken the military 's political role included the evolution of a certain strategic distancing and independence from the military and increased support for the Islamic constituency , as evidenced by Suharto 's performance of the haj to Mecca and the establishment of the Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals ' Association with B. J. Habibie as its patron. ( n28 ) The appointment of a civilian head in Harmoko for ABRI 's functional political party GOLKAR was another such initiative . Moreover , ABRI 's representation in the DPR was reduced from 100 to 75 seats before the 1998 elections . Finally , Suharto allowed Habibie to make major decisions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entire former East German navy . Heavy state expenditures on the manufacture of a domestic passenger aircraft through IPTN ( Industri Pesawat Terbangan Nusantara ) , which was headed by Habibie , also irked ABRI . <p> Because of the political violence involving ABRI associated with the downfall of Suharto 's government , ABRI changed its name to Tentera Nasional Indonesia ( TNI ) in October 1998 . Since then , a number of other measures have significantly weakened the political status of TNI , such as the separation of the National Police Force from TNI in April 1999 . As a result of the separation , matters pertaining to internal security are now handled by the police rather than by the military . In addition to depriving the military of control over domestic issues , the measure was meant to reduce the likelihood of intensified political violence during difficult times and the use of such situations for strategic political gain . <p> The military 's role and representation in domestic politics has also been significantly reduced . In January 1999 , TNI 's representation in the DPR was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual phasing-out of its presence in the DPR altogether . TNI 's share of seats in the provincial legislatures has also been reduced from 20 to 10 percent . In addition , TNI announced a policy of neutrality regarding the 1999 elections and did not endorse GOLKAR as its party of choice . Earlier , the TNI faction within the MPR had even agreed to eventually phase out its dual-function role , although no specific timetable for that move was offered. ( n29 ) Abdurrahman Wahid 's government also broke the army 's control over the appointment of the PANG TNI ( commander of the armed forces ) through the initial appointment of Widodo as the replacement for Wiranto . Likewise , the MENHANKAM ( minister of defense and security ) was , until recently , a civilian appointee ( Juwono Sudarsono ) . ( n30 ) <p> Further reductions of TNI 's political role include the removal of DOM ( Daerah Operasi Militer , or Military Operations Area ) status from Aceh , which has been racked by separatist violence over the past decade. ( n31 ) TNI 's policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acer Movement , had led to widespread abuses of power in the form of killing , rape , and torture . The negative publicity associated with TNI activities in Aceh came at a time of widespread publicity surrounding evidence of TNI collusion in the arming and training of the pro-integration militias in East Timor , who were involved in atrocities against ethnic Timorese before and after the independence referendum in August 1999 . The removal of DOM status from Aceh was meant to indicate the Indonesian government 's willingness to arrive at an acceptable political settlement . The highly publicized trials of TNI soldiers implicated in military brutality in Aceh and the powers granted to the National Human Rights Commission headed by the outspoken activist Marzuki Darusman also helped to restore faith in the government . However , secessionist and ethno-religious riots have broken out with such rapidity and intensity in Kalimantan , Maluku , and Sulawesi that restoring civilian control over such areas will take much time and reconciliation . Comparing Democratic Developments in Thailand and Indonesia : Problems and Prospects <p> From this examination of the manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian political supremacy over the military , it is evident that Thailand is off to a better start . Among the reasons are the gradual evolution of parliamentary democracy in Thailand , the assertiveness of reformist elements in the country , the agreement of the military to accept a role reduction in domestic politics , and the noninvolvement of the military in territorial administration . The Indonesian reforms clearly require much more time to mature and refine themselves . They are more difficult to implement , given the extensive linkages between TNI on the one hand and GOLKAR , the DPR , the MPR , and the provincial legislatures on the other . The territorial administration of TNI and the violence in many parts of post-Suharto Indonesia also present TNI with immense opportunities to appropriate political roles in the future . Finally , the shadowy nature of the violence and of its subsequent suppression make pinpointing perpetrators difficult . The noncontiguous nature of the state and the distances between the capital in Jakarta and some of the outer islands make administration and enforcement of compliance extremely difficult . Nonetheless , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger budget allocations to the provinces . <p> It is clear that Thailand has progressed much farther than has Indonesia in the development of democratic politics . From the outset , Thailand 's greatest disadvantage lay in structural impediments . Many of those impediments have been removed , and formal structures and practices associated with democracy have been implemented , including a new constitution and changes in the electoral rules to ensure greater fairness and openness and hence more democratic outcomes . Elections have been extended even to the Senate , while political power is firmly retained in the Lower House . Measures to prevent political corruption have also been instituted , and the military 's political role has been simultaneously reduced . Moreover , Thailand had a head start in the gradual evolution of democratic practices from the 1980s through almost a decade of finetuning of implementation procedures . Pressures for democratization were locally generated and coincided with the military 's significant loss of legitimacy following the collapse of communism as a global force and the disbandment of the domestic Communist Party of Thailand . Almost two decades of socioeconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic rights and practices , hold promise for the evolution of a participant political culture. ( n32 ) The growing popularity of political parties and the general acceptance  --  even by both serving and retired members of the military  --  that political legitimacy comes from competitive multiparty elections enhance the prospects for democracy in Thailand . <p> In Indonesia , on the other hand , although there is a commitment to the process of democratic reform , evidenced by the general election of 1999 and the emergence of multiparty competition for political legitimacy , a number of problems remain . To achieve a smooth and orderly transition toward democracy in the midst of economic hardship and widespread sectarian violence will be a challenge . Strong centrifugal tensions have tended in the direction of secessionism since the referendum in favor of Timorese independence in August 1999 . As a result , the Indonesian government faces the difficult challenge of maintaining the state 's territorial integrity and subduing sectarian violence while promoting greater corporate responsibility and transparency , improving socioeconomic development , fulfilling the requirements of international donor agencies , weakening the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extreme heterogeneity of the Indonesian population makes governance that much more difficult. ( n33 ) Its status as an archipelagic state of more than fourteen thousand islands , spanning more than 5,000 kilometers from Sumatra to West Irian , encourages the dissipation of state power away from the center . These difficulties encourage the military 's continued claim to political involvement . Moreover , the willingness of the previous elite to sow discord leading to violence exacerbated the problems of democratic governance . Nonetheless , the current Indonesian government was democratically elected , and reformist elements are eager to take advantage of this historic opportunity . Amid overwhelming difficulties , there is a push for more transparent and accountable government . <p> The differences between Thailand and Indonesia should not be exaggerated . Thailand , although substantially ahead of Indonesia in the movement toward democracy , faces its own set of problems . These include a rather splintered and fragile party system that is often based on personalities . Both majority and minority coalition governments have been unstable in the past , and defections of leading personalities to bring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite increased vigilance against political corruption , vote buying is still rampant , especially in the poorer regions of the northeast . The large number of voters in that region alone is sufficient to annul democratic gains in the urban centers , as evidenced by Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh 's ability to lead the New Aspiration Party to victory in 1996 . Provincial warlords ( jao pho ) are also often able to deliver block votes. ( n34 ) <p> The onset of democracy in both countries is also contingent on the ability of their governments to cope with antidemocratic forces , especially those associated with the military . Thailand is more fortunate than Indonesia in this regard , despite the Thai military 's economic interests in radio , television , logging , and banking . Indonesia 's TNI is much more difficult to deal with , given the military 's extensive linkages with the state and provincial bureaucracies and legislatures , its economic interests and monopolies in the mining and extractive industries and in imports and distribution of foodstuffs , and its territorial control of state resources . The TNI continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has attempted to weaken the power and influence of senior commanders . Conclusion <p> Both Thailand and Indonesia witnessed the collapse of authoritarian government in the 1990s . Concurrently , both countries embarked on a process of democratization . They show progress in a number of important distinguishing features of democratization : structural changes in the political system in favor of democracy , the invocation of multiparty politics , transparent and accountable policy making , and the preservation of fundamental liberties of expression and association . Mass media and NGOs representing plural and independent interests have also come into being . <p> The evidence thus far clearly favors Thailand 's chances for democracy over those of Indonesia . Thailand has advantages in the evolutionary nature of its democracy , an independent bureaucracy , and a military that has indicated a certain willingness to return to the barracks . The situation in Indonesia is complicated by the size and noncontiguous nature of the country ; by the military 's deep permeation of state institutions and its territorial deployment ; by widespread sectarian violence , sponsored by disenchanted elites ; and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer than most developing countries in establishing democratic governance . Finally , it may be noted that both countries have attempted to establish democracy through a top-down institutionalist approach rather than a popular approach that emphasizes inclusion and contestation . The process and the product may become interactive over time , but it is too early to determine if the ongoing efforts will indeed yield a permanent democratic culture . <p>
