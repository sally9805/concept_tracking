The Virtual Jock <P> AN ELECTRONIC ALL-STAR <P> When your parents told you that playing video games would never lead to anything , they should have hedged their warning : video games wo n't lead to anything unless you 're really , really good at them . Johnathan Wendel , better known on the Internet by his gaming handle , Fatal1ty ( note the 1 for extra cybercred ) , is that good . He 's so good that at 22 he is among the first people in the history of civilization to make a living as a professional video-game player . <P> Wendel grew up in Kansas City , Mo. , where he was nothing like the quintessentially nerdy mouse jockey you 're probably picturing . He was actually kind of a jock : he played baseball , football , golf , hockey , tennis , whatever . But it was in video games that he stood out . " When I was 12 to 15 years old , I went to arcades a lot and played Mortal Kombat 2 religiously , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the big dogs , and I usually took home about $50 a night . For a 13-year-old , that 's a lot of money . " <P> When Fatal1ty got involved with Quake , an ultraviolent action game you can play online , his price tag got bigger . Quake had an active , organized Internet community that held real-world tournaments . By 1999 , when Wendel was 18 , he was splitting his time among gaming , attending school and waiting tables . Wendel 's parents were n't quite as excited about his career as he was  --  " I think I spent most of my teenage life grounded from the computer , " he says  --  but he convinced them the old-fashioned way : with cold cash . When he placed third at a major tournament in Dallas , he went home , slapped a check on the table and said , " I won $4,000 playing a video game ! " Since then , Wendel has been world champion of the Cyberathlete Professional League ( CPL )  --  the gamer 's equivalent of the NBA  --  three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in tournaments in Brazil , Britain , Sweden , Germany , France and Finland , and all over the U.S. and Asia . Outfits like the CPL are bent on becoming big-time spectator-sports leagues like the NFL or the NBA . After all , Wendel says , football and basketball " used to be just games too . But now they 're a way of life . "  --  By Lev Grossman
