<p> Washington  --  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales rebuffed calls for his resignation Tuesday as lawmakers demanded answers about the White House 's role in the firing of U.S. attorneys across the country . <p> His admission in a hastily called news conference that " mistakes were made " came as scores of newly released documents detailed a two-year campaign by the Justice Department and White House to purge federal prosecutors . <p> Gonzales acknowledged his department mishandled the dismissals of eight U.S. attorneys and misled Congress about how they were fired . He said he was ultimately to blame but stood by the firings . <p> " I believe in accountability , " said Gonzales . " I acknowledge that mistakes were made here . I accept that responsibility and my pledge to the American people is to find out what went wrong here , to assess accountability , and to make improvements so that the mistakes in this instance do not occur again in the future . " <p> It was the latest in a series of events that have rocked the administration . Last week : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency improperly used surveillance techniques . <p> * The administration dealt with the fallout from the federal conviction of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , former chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney , for lying to FBI agents investigating the disclosure of a CIA operative 's identity . <p> * The administration scrambled after reports of squalid conditions at an outpatient facility at Walter Reed Army Medical Center that resulted in the resignation and firing of several top military officials . <p> Gonzales ' apology Tuesday did little to stave off congressional Democrats and Republicans concerned that the firings of the U.S. attorneys were politically motivated , undermining confidence in the justice system . <p> Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) demanded Gonzales ' ouster as Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , called for open hearings with White House and Justice Department officials . <p> Key Republicans agreed that hearings are in order , including Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) , a long-time friend of Gonzales from their days in Texas . <p> " We ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This should not be a partisan issue . It should be one of oversight , and I support Senator Leahy to get to facts . " <p> Leahy said he was " angered " to learn in news reports Tuesday that internal e-mails and documents show there was collusion between the White House and the Justice Department in the dismissal of the U.S. attorneys . He vowed to hold hearings as soon as possible , saying testimony in the matter so far " has not been complete . " <p> Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty and other Justice Department officials have told Congress under oath that the decision to fire eight U.S. attorneys was made by the Justice Department without intervention by the White House . But the newly released documents show that Harriet Miers , the White House legal counsel , suggested two years ago that the Justice Department fire all 93 U.S. attorneys across the country . <p> " Obviously , I am concerned about the fact that information  --  incomplete information  --  was communicated or may have been communicated to the Congress , " Gonzales said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreed with Miers ' proposal and instead approved the dismissal of a smaller group of prosecutors . <p> He assigned D. Kyle Sampson , his chief of staff , to handle the matter . Sampson resigned on Monday , reportedly after admitting he had not told his bosses about the extent of his many discussions with the White House about removing the prosecutors . That led to incomplete testimony before Congress  --  a fact that lawmakers seized upon . <p> " Time and time again , we 've heard falsehoods , " Schumer said in a floor speech immediately after Gonzales held his news conference . <p> In a Sept. 13 , 2006 , e-mail to Miers , Sampson listed one dismissed prosecutor , Bud Cummins of Arkansas , as " in the process of being pushed out . " He said there were five other prosecutors  --  in Arizona ; Nevada ; Grand Rapids , Mich. ; San Diego ; and Seattle  --  " we should now consider pushing out . " <p> Miers responded : " Kyle , thanks for this . I have not forgotten I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . " <p> Nearly three months later , Sampson wrote to another aide that he was still waiting for White House approval . The White House deputy counsel responded that there was " a go for the US Atty plan . " <p> At the time of their dismissal , five of the eight attorneys were involved with political corruption investigations of Republicans . Another has testified before Congress that he had been contacted by Republicans in Congress wanting to know whether he would deliver indictments against Democrats before the November 2006 elections . <p> Bush , in Mexico to meet with President Felipe Calderon , had no comment Tuesday . But White House spokesman Tony Snow said Bush remains supportive of Gonzales , his long-time friend and aide . <p> The episode began , according to Snow , with Miers wanting to bringing in " fresh blood " after Bush 's 2004 re-election . But he said her suggestion to ask all 93 U.S. attorneys to resign " was quickly rejected by the Justice Department . " <p> " Nobody at the White House was involved in suggesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not a firm recommendation that you 're firing everybody . " <p> Bush , Gonzales and other Justice Department officials discussed the matter in a White House meeting last October , Snow said . <p> The contact was appropriate because it dealt with administration concerns over whether reports of voter fraud were being pursued with sufficient vigor , he said . <p> No specific U.S. attorneys were discussed during the session , according to Snow , who said Bush was unaware of Miers ' proposal to fire all of them . <p> " We do n't have anything to indicate the president made any calls on specific U.S. attorneys , " Snow said . <p> The Associated Press and The New York Times contributed to this article .
