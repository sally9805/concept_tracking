Section : ECONOMICS " An improved living standard is a potent antidote to the discontent that frequently fuels fanaticism . " <p> THE ROOTS OF RADICALISM in the Middle East are as tangled as the tales of Scheherazade , but one particular branch of the tree that is feeding the terrorist mentality is the dismal state of the economy in the countries that are spawning the Mohamed Attas of the world . Unemployment exceeds 50% in Iraq , 25% in Egypt , and 26% for males 20 to 24 years old in Saudi Arabia  --  the birthplace of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden . Moreover , nine out of 10 Egyptians searching for jobs have college diplomas . <p> American businesses hold the key to defusing this particular aspect of the terrorist scourge . Over the long term , putting the vast jobless population of the Middle East to work has the potential to help dispel some of the anti-American sentiment that has placed our country on a perpetual terror alert . Seeing Americans and American companies up close and personal will help plant the seeds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hate the adversary you know than the one you do n't . <p> Coincidentally , U.S. enterprises that invest in these developing Middle East countries will be able to avail themselves of a young , educated , highly motivated , and relatively inexpensive pool of labor . This is a case where being a good corporate citizen also can amount to smart business . <p> As a native-born Syrian , an American citizen , and a longtime U.S. businessman , I can see the value of this strategy . I grew up in Damascus and still have family in Syria . I came to the U.S. to attend college in 1982 and have lived here ever since . However , for the first 17 years of my life , I saw the U.S. through Middle Eastern eyes . My own house was an island of neutrality  --  my father is a French-educated physician who instilled in his offspring a broad tolerance for the ways of the West  --  but my friends , teachers , and , particularly the media , conveyed a different message . In retrospect , I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that literally exploded before our eyes on Sept 11 . <p> In Syria and elsewhere around the Middle East , particularly in countries with a government-controlled press , the U.S. traditionally has been demonized as a power-and money-hungry empire bent on taking over the world and remaking it in its own capitalist , materialistic image . In some places today , those views finally are being tempered by a more open press , without such an overtly political and/or religious agenda . Yet , it will be difficult to undo the years of conditioning caused by this drumbeat of America-bashing . <p> Because of my heritage , I also understand the more rational origins of the hostility toward the U.S. in the Middle East . Fairly or unfairly , in the corner of the world where I was born , American foreign policy is perceived to be driven purely by economic interests . Syria sends soldiers into Lebanon ? No U.S. intervention . Civil war and ethnic cleansing in Rwanda ? Hands off . Iraq invades Kuwait ? Oil is at stake ; send in the troops . <p> In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the most repressive regimes in Arabia , from the Shah of Iran to deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . All these factors and more have combined to create a breeding ground for mistrust of the West in general and America in particular . As we now know , Islamic fundamentalists have seized on this rancor and resistance to American-style modernization to unleash spasms of terror directed , in part , against symbols of U.S. power such as the World Trade Center and Pentagon . <p> Given this deep-seated distrust of all things American , it is imperative that we mend fences with the Middle East in ways that will have an impact on the average citizen . The road to peaceful coexistence must be paved with economic development . If we can equip our jobless brethren in the hotbeds of religious extremism with a livelihood , it is logical to assume that they will be much less vulnerable to propaganda proclaiming that the U.S. and the West is conspiring against them . <p> The economic challenge behind this proposition is not as daunting as it sounds . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry for capital , and quite a few already have free trade zones that attempt to lure foreign investors by offering incentives such as corporate tax holidays , tax breaks , simplified money exchange , and a variety of other regulations that reduce trade barriers . <p> Free trade zones have been established in Egypt , Jordan , and elsewhere in the Gulf of Arabia . Three years ago , for example , Jordan formed the Aqaba Special Economic Zone to turn the picturesque , strategically located port of Aqaba on the Red Sea into a duty-free center for tourism , manufacturing , and recreational and services activities . Hotels , resorts , shopping centers , and the foundations for an industrial park are among the projects currently under construction . <p> Incentives in the Aqaba Zone include a five percent flat income tax rate and no annual property taxes , capital gains taxes , or social security charges . Privileges for foreign investors include full exemption from custom duties and tariffs , and 50-year land leases that can be extended to 100 years under certain circumstances . Bureaucracy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect in a free zone that Jordan operates in Zarqa , near the capital in Amman . <p> While U.S. participation in Jordan 's free trade zones has been facilitated by the Jordan U.S. Free Trade Agreement signed in October , 2000 , U.S. investment in most free trade zones to date has been minimal . With the laws and the groundwork already in place to support foreign enterprise , American businesses have a golden opportunity to open new outlets in these markets and begin reversing the destabilizing effects of unemployment in the area . The labor force is educated . Many speak English as a second language , while reasonable wages as well as the economic environment are business-friendly . AU that remains is to take advantage of the broad incentives to invest . <p> For countries without special enterprise zones , the challenge is different , but not insur-mountable . Let 's look at Iraq . In June , 2003 , the top U.S. official stationed in that country announced the formation of a Business Support and Information Center in Baghdad designed to help Iraqis start businesses as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , said the center would be a joint project of the U.S.-led occupation government , the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the United Nations Development Program . <p> While it remains to be seen how much investment will come from the U.S. , as well as whether this country will lift 13 years of economic sanctions to pave the way for American commerce in Iraq without obtaining Washington 's approval , this initiative is one sign that new doors are opening for Western businesses . <p> There also is the postwar restoration being performed in Iraq by the likes of Bechtel Corporation , the San Francisco , Calif. construction company tapped by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) as the primary contractor to rebuild Iraq 's damaged infrastructure , and Halliburton Company , the Houston , Tex. - based energy services firm formerly run by Vice Pres. Dick Cheney that won a controversial , no-bid contract to make emergency repairs to Iraq 's oil fields and refineries . <p> If history is any guide , these efforts will put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosovo and Bosnia in the 1990s largely employed local labor . To that end , the $680,000,000 Bechtel contract stipulates that the company " engage the Iraqi population and work to build local capacity . " Although USAID lacks the ability to enforce that provision , in May , 2003 , Bechtel announced its first subcontract with a Baghdad-based firm for a small project involving the construction of a bypass around a war-damaged bridge in the western part of the country . <p> Cliff Mumm , program director for Bechtel 's project team , said at the time that the subcontract was " the first of many agreements we will have with Iraqi firms , " and maintained that it represented Bechtel 's commitment to " developing a work program that maximizes use of Iraqi contractors and workers . " This could be an important step in beginning to reshape Arab attitudes toward America and American companies . <p> The Administration appears to be solidly behind this strategy . In a commencement address at the University of South Carolina , Pres. Bush climbed on the bandwagon with a long-range plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belief that prosperity is the key to democracy and stability , the President proposed working toward a free trade zone across the Middle East that would help promote trade with the U.S. ' The combined Gross Domestic Product of all Arab countries is smaller than that of Spain , " he noted . " Their peoples have less access to the Internet than the people of Sub-Sahara Africa . The Arab world has a great cultural tradition , but is largely missing out on the economic progress of our time . Across the globe , free markets and trade have helped defeat poverty , and taught men and women the habits of liberty . So I propose the establishment of a U.S.-Middle East free trade area within a decade , to bring the Middle East into an expanding circle of opportunity , to provide hope for the people who live in that region . " <p> The free trade area would be built step-by-step , with the U.S. gradually combining countries reaching bilateral free trade agreements with Washington into a regional accord . The U.S. then would help member countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase their exports and attract foreign investment . Whether or not Arab nations embrace the concept the fact that Bush has floated this particular trial balloon confirms that his policy advisors believe that commerce can play an important role in combating the conditions that have helped give rise to terrorism . <p> Ultimately , the decision of whether to invest in the Middle East rests with American corporations themselves , and on that score the business community typically cites two stumbling blocks . One is that employees and executives who are dispatched to countries with extremist tendencies will be put in harm 's way . The other is that the business risk is too great because both the economies and the governments in these areas are unstable . <p> These are valid concerns , but they must be placed in perspective . As to the safety issue , relatively few Westerners have been abducted or killed in the Middle East in recent history , even amid the suicide bombers ' reign of terror in Israel . Stories like the horrific 2002 kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rightly so . These types of tragedies , though , are infrequent . Besides , Sept. 11 showed us that there is no immunity from terrorism anywhere in the world , even on American soil . <p> In terms of business risk , American capital is less in jeopardy than one might think , particularly in free trade zones . In order to attract investment , these zones have instituted a variety of policies and regulations specifically designed to protect foreign businesses , frequently including a prohibition on the socialization of private enterprise . Careful research and long-term planning by American businesses preparing to enter the Middle East can help mitigate the hazards even further . <p> Here again , history provides a precedent . Many of the same objections were voiced about India when foreign businesses began to invest there in the 1980s and 1990s . Sikh extremists were a concern , particularly after the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Sikh members of her bodyguard in retaliation for her suppression of radicals seeking autonomy for the state of Punjab . <p> Yet , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most coveted areas for American businesses , both as a place to operate and as a marketplace for American goods . Anxieties about safety and stability have fallen by the wayside , and the foreign investments have paid off handsomely . There is every reason to believe that similar success can be achieved in the Middle East . <p> Unquestionably , any effort by U.S. businesses to expand into this troubled area of the world will be easier in some countries than others . In Afghanistan , for instance , the majority of the population is illiterate . With the exception of infrastructure improvements , there is little business opportunity there . Years of education and other spade work will be required to bring the beleaguered nation into the global economy , and it may be a full generation before the effort begins to pay off . <p> Vision is what matters here , not rapid return on investment . By helping these countries win the war against rampant poverty and unemployment  --  much of which affects the young men who are particularly susceptible to the fire and brimstone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden from gaining a foothold and marshaling a new generation of angry extremists . An improved living standard is a potent antidote to the discontent that frequently fuels fanaticism . <p> This is not simply a question of shielding America from further terrorist trauma . It also is a matter of corporate responsibility . Not so long ago , it was enough for a business to be a good corporate citizen by supporting local causes and refraining from dumping toxic waste into the community it called home . In today 's era of globalization , corporations no longer exist solely in the cities  --  or even countries  --  where they operate . They have become citizens of the world , and they should act accordingly . <p> We never will eradicate extremism completely , but we have the ability to lessen the influence of demagogues who prey on the disaffected and desperate . If American businesses are willing to invest in the Middle East , they not only will open new markets for themselves , but also play a crucial role in making the world a safer place . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take the entire planet to create a climate to allow that child to live in peace . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Rudian Arafeh <p> <p> Rudian Arafeh is the chief executive officer of Configure Inc. , a computer network consultancy headquartered in San Jose , Calif . <p>
