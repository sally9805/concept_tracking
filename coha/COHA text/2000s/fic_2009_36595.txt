Ivy Peterman <p> Eighteen months later <p> Fight or flight ? Until recently , it 's never been a question . Not for me . <p> Whenever I feel frightened or threatened , my first instinct has always been flight . I do it pretty regularly . <p> I was six years old when my father had a heart attack and died . The news sent me running into the woods in the back of our house . I could hear my mother calling for me , her voice raspy with tears and shock and anger , but would n't budge from my hiding place in the branches of a half-dead oak . Finally , she sent our neighbor , Pete , out to find me . <p> Just after my sixteenth birthday , Mom was killed in a head-on collision and Pete , who was by then my stepfather , also became my legal guardian . He and I had never gotten along , but then again neither had he and Mom , not since about ten minutes after their wedding . After Mom died , Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran away again . Farther this time , buying a one-way train ticket to the city . So far that Pete would never be able to find me , though now I realize he probably never tried . <p> And , of course , when I was twenty-four , I ran away from my husband . This time I took my two babies with me . <p> My escape was n't exactly well-planned . <p> The day began normally enough , with a trip to the department store and a new tube of lipstick , but by that night I was running . I had to . I was afraid , not just for my life but for the lives of my children . All I took were some clothes , a file with some personal papers , the kids ' baby books , some jewelry I sold later , and about $288 in cash , fifty-six of it from the spare change jar we kept on the kitchen counter . That 's all . I had credit cards , but I did n't take them . I was worried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used them . <p> When we could find an opening , we lived in emergency shelters . When we could n't , we lived in the car . That was the hardest time . The kids were cranky , and so was I. The things I 'd taken for granted while living in a nice house in the suburbs , like being able to keep clean and warm , using a toilet whenever we wanted to , or eating hot food , were concerns that occupied my every waking moment . I had no reserve of time or energy to consider how I was going to get us out of that mess , only enough to survive the day . <p> One night , I was asleep on the front seat and heard a noise . I woke up to see a figure , a man , pressed up against the passenger side window of the backseat , where my kids were sleeping , trying to slide a hanger wire into the space between the window and the door . I did n't think , just jumped out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't touch them ! Get away ! " <p> Somewhere along the line I must have grabbed the metal flashlight from the side storage compartment in the door . Still screaming , I flung it at the intruder and it hit him in the head . He swore and ran off into the alley . The kids woke up and started crying . A tall , scruffy man with a four-day growth of beard-the clerk from the twenty-four-hour mini-mart where I 'd decided to park that night , stupidly thinking it was a safe spot-heard the commotion and came outside to investigate . <p> He took one look at me , tears in my eyes while I tried to quiet Bethany and Bobby 's sobbing , and decided to call the police . Over my protests , he went inside the store to make the call . I got in the car and told the kids to buckle up . There was no way I was going to stick around and answer a bunch of questions from the police . If Hodge had filed a report saying I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids away from me forever . That 's what Hodge said would happen if I ever even thought about leaving him . He did n't say that out of any kind of love , but just to make me believe that no matter what I did or where I went , he would still be in control . And I did believe it . I 'd put hundreds miles of road between us , but even so I could feel his power , the menace of his presence , just like I always had . We had to get out of there . <p> My tires squealed as I peeled out of the parking lot , my mind racing . Did it made more sense for me to get on the freeway and go to another town ? Or better to find a dark alley and park there until the coast was clear ? I decided on the freeway . <p> In the backseat the kids were still crying . I swore under my breath , cursing traffic engineers who were too cheap or too stupid to put up any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later I was still lost . Bethany had stopped crying , but Bobby was still going strong . <p> I looked in the rearview mirror and saw his face , his chubby baby cheeks flushed and hot , his black lashes clumped and glistening with tears . " Bobby . Calm down , baby . Mommy is going to find a quiet place to park and then you can go back to sleep , all right ? " <p> " Go home ! " he wailed . " Go home ! " <p> And for the first time , I wondered if I was doing the right thing . A few weeks before , my children had been living the relatively normal , scheduled lives of children in the suburbs ; three meals a day , playing on the swing set in our fenced backyard , watching cartoons , baths at seven , bed at eight . Of course , when it was time for Hodge to come home , they 'd get clingy and quiet , feeling my fear , perhaps , as I listened for the grind of gears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assess the level of force Hodge used to slam the door of his BMW , a clue as to his mood and what the rest of the evening would bring . <p> But , I told myself as I drove through the darkness , he was n't violent every night . Only when I 'd done something , or not done something , that made him mad . After all , I was the one he took his anger out on . Not the kids . Maybe they 'd be better off if we went back . At least they 'd be safe . <p> But a voice in my head reminded me that it was n't true anymore . <p> I remembered that last day , Hodge screaming and swearing and pounding on one side of the locked bathroom door , while we huddled on the other side . I remembered the swelling of my left eye , pain shooting through my bleeding hand , but worse , so much worse , was the memory of the angry red mark on Bethany 's pale cheek . <p> Bethany was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice packs on my bruises , or trying to cover up the marks of his fury with extra makeup , but he 'd never hit her before . That day , he considered her fair game and I realized that from then on , he always would . <p> In the backseat , Bethany tried to calm her baby brother . " Bobby , do n't cry . We ca n't go home . Daddy 's there . " <p> She was right . I could n't take them back . Not now . It was n't safe to go back to Hodge . Not for me and not for my children . But we could n't go on like this , either . We could n't keep running . I was tired , and scared , and broke . Somehow or other I had to come up with another plan . But what ? <p> To say that I have n't had a lot of experience with praying in my life would be an understatement , but that night , driving around in the middle of the night without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do when we arrived , I prayed silently , asking God for a sign or at least a hint . <p> Lost in uncharted territory , I accidentally turned onto the northbound freeway entrance instead of the southbound . By the time I figured it out , I was crossing the state line into Connecticut . And that 's how I ended up in New Bern . <p> After three weeks living in a tiny studio apartment in the emergency shelter , we moved into a much larger two-bedroom unit in the Stanton Center . The counselor talked to me about putting down roots , finding a job , and putting Bethany in school . I nodded , mutely assenting to everything she suggested , but in my heart , I knew we 'd stay in New Bern only as long as it felt safe to do so . That was more than a year ago and , believe me , nobody is more surprised than I am that we 're still here . If not for Evelyn Dixon and a log cabin quilt , I 'd have put New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Evelyn owns Cobbled Court Quilts in New Bern . She runs a free quilting class for the women at the shelter . Initially , I did n't want to take the class and had suitcase full of good excuses for not doing so : <p> 1 ) With two kids , I was too busy for hobbies . <p> 2 ) I 'd never liked crafts , anyway , and any spare time I had really should be spent looking for a job . <p> 3 ) And was n't quilting something people 's grandmas did ? Maybe I 'd lived long and hard , but I 'm not exactly ready for bifocals and a rocking chair , you know what I mean ? <p> But , none of those were the real reason I did n't want to take Evelyn 's class . The truth is ; I just did n't want to find one more thing to fail at . There had been so many already . <p> But Abigail decided to change my mind for me . That 's Abigail Burgess Wynne , a volunteer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who insisted that they find room for us at the shelter . Abigail is something of an oddball . Beautiful , in a nineteen fifties movie-star kind of way , all long legs and perfect diction , but an oddball . <p> She comes off as a snob but , for some reason , she took a liking to Bethany . Out of the blue , Abigail made this gorgeous pinwheel quilt for Bethany and they 've been fast friends ever since . She 's become not quite an adopted grandmother to my kids , but more of an indulgent great aunt . And I have to say she 's grown on me . Anybody who loves my kids is okay in my book and when she gave that quilt to Bethany , I was so grateful that I started to bawl . I could n't help myself . <p> Anyway , Abigail is really very sweet deep down-way deep down-but she 's also used to getting her own way . She would n't listen to any of my excuses about passing on the quilting class , just knocked them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out words like " Nonsense ! " and " Rubbish ! " like the big , bad wolf on a mission , not stopping until your little house of sticks is lying in a heap and there you stand with nothing left to hide behind . Next thing I knew , I was sitting in a room with six other students , listening to Evelyn Dixon explain the techniques for constructing our first project , a log cabin quilt . <p> It 's an easy pattern , just row after row of rectangular strips nesting round and round a center square , stacking one upon the other like those wooden log toys I used to play with when I was a little girl . A simple pattern , maybe the simplest of all . I never expected it to change my life . <p> Evelyn brought a selection of light and dark fabrics for us to use for the " shady " and " sunny " sides of the house , but for the center of each block , the " hearth , " she told us to find our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had a special meaning for us . I chose the outgrown clothes the kids had worn in their pictures with Santa the year before , a red cowboy shirt for Bobby and the red corduroy jumper for Bethany , and cut out little squares , making them as even and perfect as I could , to place in the center of each block . <p> And then , something strange happened . As I sewed that quilt , stitching strip after strip around those red squares that had lain next to my children 's skin and hearts , I started imagining each sunny and shady strip as a piece of a protective wall that was guarding my little ones and somehow , in a way that all my counselor 's repeated affirmations never could , the idea that I could keep us safe , that I could make a real home for all of us , started to sprout in my mind . As I sewed , the idea became a belief and the roots of that belief pushed their way through all my doubts and muck to take root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , no matter what . And we would have a home , a real home , not sleeping in a car , or bouncing from shelter to shelter and town to town like a bad check , not continually looking over my shoulder , ready to pack up and run every time I had a bad dream or heard a grinding of gears that sounded like a garage door opening . We 'd be a family . Everything would be all right . I would make it happen . <p> As this ... this torrent of conviction flooded my heart , my eyes began to flood , too . I sat at the sewing machine , not sewing , scissors open in my hand , a silent baptism bathing my cheeks . <p> Across the room , Evelyn was bent over another student 's machine , helping adjust a too-tight tension . She saw me but made no move toward me , just looked at me for a long moment , as if trying to see into my real meaning , questioning the reason for my tears but not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a little straighter in my chair , and gave her one quick nod . She smiled , as if knowing and approving that there , among the soft , steady whir of needles passing through fabric and the silent concentration of other women crouched over their sewing machines , bent on making something beautiful and useful out of the discarded scraps of their lives , I had made my decision . <p> I was done running . <p> Chapter Two Evelyn Dixon <p> Walking out my front door , down the porch steps , through the garden gate and onto the sidewalk on a perfect late spring day in New England , I was reminded again what a great commute I have . Just three blocks from the cozy , two-bedroom cape where I live at a very reasonable rent , to my shop , Cobbled Court Quilts . <p> My shop ! I love saying that . In a week 's time , it will have been my shop for two years , but sometimes I still have to pinch myself to believe it 's true . Less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painful divorce and a general upending of everything I 'd thought was sure in my life , I got in my car and drove from Texas to Connecticut to see the fall colors . <p> On its face , there 's nothing too remarkable about that , but anyone who knows me knows that spontaneous gestures are not my strong suit . I am a big fan of lists , not just to-do lists but the kind where you write down all the pros and cons of doing something and mull it over for days , weeks , or even months before taking action ... or not . If you do n't believe me , ask Charlie Donnelly , the owner of New Bern 's finest restaurant , The Grill on the Green , and my boyfriend . <p> Boyfriend . At fifty years of age , it feels silly to say I have a boyfriend , but what else can I call Charlie ? He 's more than my friend and less than my fiancT , which is what he 'd like to be , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Charlie and I became " a couple " ( are there any words for a romantic relationship between two mature people that do n't sound so ridiculously precious ? ) right after my double mastectomy , I was n't sure I was ready for a relationship . Now , I 've worked through a lot of those issues in my mind , but ... how do I explain it ? After a lifetime of being someone 's daughter , wife , mother , of defining my existence in terms of who I belonged to , I 'm enjoying being just me by myself for a while , steering my own ship . Charlie knows that and he 's willing to be patient . In fact , I think he 's kind of proud of what I 've accomplished . And the truth is , so am I. Not that I got to this place alone , far from it , but none of it would have happened if I had n't finally decided to tear up my list of lists and take a chance on life and on myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were supposed to do something , even though , on the face of it , that thing you wanted to do made no sense to anyone else ? That 's the way it was with me with the quilt shop . <p> Window-shopping at the end of an absolutely picture-perfect fall day in New Bern during my unplanned escape from Texas to New England , I happened upon an alley paved with old cobblestones that lead into a spacious , square courtyard and found a dilapidated storefront that had been empty for about twenty years . The windows were cracked , the wood casings were eaten away by termites and rot , and the roof was leaky , but , for reasons beyond understanding , I was absolutely sure that my destiny lay in renting this ramshackle ruin and opening it as a quilt shop . So , throwing caution to the winds twice in one week , that 's what I did . <p> Everybody , and I mean everybody , said we would n't last six months . They were almost right . In a turn of cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host Cobbled Court 's first Quilt Pink event to benefit breast cancer research , my doctor informed me that I had breast cancer myself . I was sure it was all over , that the predictions of the naysayers would prove true : Cobbled Court Quilts would be forced to close its doors and the door to my dreams would close along with it . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
