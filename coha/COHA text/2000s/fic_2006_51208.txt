Ysabeau Wilce introduced us to Hardhands , Tiny Doom , and their fabulously baroque environs with " Metal More Attractive " in our Feb. 2004 issue . It has taken more than two years for us to get a new story from her , but that 's only because she has been working on novels for young readers ; the first book , entitled Flora Segunda , or the Magickal Mishaps of a Girl of Spirit , Her Glass-Gazing Sidekick , Two Ominous Butlers ( One Blue ) , a House with Eleven Thousand Rooms and a Red Dog , is due out in the Fall . These days , Ms. Wilce lives in Chicago . <p> " Abstinence sows sand all over <p> The ruddy limbs &; flowing hair <p> But Desire Gratified <p> Plants fruit of life &; beauty there . " <p> - William Blake <p> I : STAGE FRIGHT <p> Here is Hardhands up on the stage , and he 's cheery cherry , sparking fire , he 's as fast as a fox-trotter , stepping high . Sweaty blood dribbles his brow , bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzsaw whines , its whirling outer edge black enough to cut glass . The razor in his hand flashes like a heliograph as he motions the final Gesture of the Invocation . The Eye of the Vortex flutters , but its perimeter remains firmly within the structure of Hardhands ' Will and does not expand . He ululates a Command , and the Eye begins to open , like a pupil dilating in sunlight , and from its vivid yellowness comes a glimpse of scales and horns , struggling not to be born . <p> Someone tugs at Hardhands ' foot . His concentration wavers . Someone yanks on the hem of his kilt . His concentration wiggles , and the Vortex wobbles slightly like a run-down top . Someone tugs on his foot , and his concentration collapses completely , and so does the Vortex , sucking into itself like water down a drain . There goes the Working for which Hardhands has been preparing for the last two weeks , and there goes the Tygers of Wrath 's new drummer , and there goes their boot-kicking show . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking down , prepares to smite . His lover is shouting upward at him , words that Hardhands can hardly hear , words he hopes he can hardly hear , words he surely did not hear a-right . The interior of the club is toweringly loud , noisy enough to make the ears bleed , but suddenly the thump of his heart , already driven hard by the strength of his magickal invocation , is louder . <p> Relais , pale as paper , repeats the shout . This time there is no , mistaking what he says , much as Hardhands would like to mistake it , much as he would like to hear something else , something sweet and charming , something like : you are the prettiest thing ever born , or the Goddess grants wishes in your name , or they are killing themselves in the streets because the show is sold right out . Alas , Relais is shouting nothing quite so sweet . <p> " What do you mean , you can not find Tiny Doom ? " . Hardhands shouts back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and there are so many of them , and most of them have huge big hair and huger bigger boots . A tiny purple girl-child and her stuffy pink pig have no hope in this throng ; they 'd be trampled underfoot in a second . That is exactly what Hardhands had told the Pontifexa earlier that day ; no babysitter , he , other business , other pleasures , no time to take care of small children , not on this night of all nights : The Tygers of Wrath 's biggest show of the year . Find someone else . <p> Well , talkers are no good doers , they say , and talking had done no good , all the yapping growling barking howling in the world had not changed the Pontifexa 's mind : it 's Paimon 's night off , darling , and she 'll be safe with you , Banastre , I can trust my heir with no one else , my sweet boy , do your teeny grandmamma this small favor and how happy I shall be , and here , kiss-kiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful evening , good luck with the show , do n't set yourself on fire , cheerie-bye my darling . <p> And now see : <p> Hardhands roars : " I told you to keep an eye on her , Relais ! " <p> He had too , he could n't exactly watch over Tiny Doom ( so called because she is the first in stature and the second in fate ) , while he was invoking the drummer , and with no drummer , there 's no show ( no show damn it ! ) and anyway if he 's learned anything as the grandson of the Pontifexa of Califa , it 's how to delegate . <p> Relais shouts back garbled defense . His eyes are whirling pie-plates . He does n't mention that he stopped at the bar on his way to break the news and that there he downed four Choronzon Delights ( hold the delight , double the Choronzon ) before screwing up the courage to face his lover 's ire . He does n't mention that he ca n't exactly remember the last time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been about the time when she said that she had to visit El Casa de Peepee ( oh cute ) and he 'd taken her as far as the door to the loo , where she had insisted haughtily she could do alone , and then he 'd been standing outside , and gotten distracted by Arsino Fyrdraaca , who 'd sauntered by , wrapped around the most gorgeous angel with rippling red wings , and then they 'd gone to get a drink , and then another drink , and then when Relais remembered that Tiny Doom and Pig were still in the potty and pushed his way back through the crush , Tiny Doom and Pig were not still in the potty anymore . <p> And now , here : <p> Up until this very second , Hardhands has been feeling dandy as candy about this night : his invocation has been powerful and sublime , the blood in his veins replaced by pure unadulterated Magickal Current , hot and heavy . Up until this very second , if he clapped his hands together , sparks would fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . If he tossed his hair , fans would implode . Just from the breeze of the Vortex through his skin , he had known this was going to be a charm of a show , the very pinnacle of bombast and bluster . The crowded club still hums with coldfire charge , the air still sparks , cracking with glints of magick : yowza . But now all that rich bubbly magick is curdling in his veins , his drummer has slid back to the Abyss , and he could beat someone with a stick . Thanks to an idiot boyfriend and a bothersome five-year-old , his evening has just tanked . <p> Hardhands ' perch is lofty . Despite the roiling smoke ( cigarillo , incense , and oil ) , he can look out over the big big hair , and see the club is as packed as a cigar box with hipsters eager to see the show . From the stage Hardhands can see a lot , his vision sharpened by the magick he 's been mainlining , and he sees : hipsters , b-boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such nighttime luminaries . He does not see a small child or a pink pig or even the tattered remnants of a small child and a pink pig or even , well , he does n't see them period . <p> Hardhands sucks in a deep breath and uses what is left of the Invocation still working through his veins to shout : " x0 ! " <p> The syllable is vigorous and combustible , flowering in the footlights like a bruise . The audience erupts into a hollering hooting howl . They think the show is about to start . They are ready and geared . Behind Hardhands , the band also mistakes his intention , and despite the lack of drummer , kicks in with the triumphant blare of a horn , the delirious bounce of the hurdy-gurdy . <p> " x6 ! " This time the shout sparks bright red , a flash of coldfire that brings tears to the eyes of the onlookers . Hardhands raises an authoritative hand toward the band , crashing them into silence . The crowd follows suit and the ensuing quiet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time his words provide no sparkage , and he knows that his Will is fading under his panic . The club is dark . It is full of large people . Outside it is darker still and the streets of South of the Slot are wet and full of dangers . No place for a Tiny Doom and her Pig , oh so edible , to be wandering around , alone . Outside it 's the worst night of the year to be wandering alone anywhere in the City , particularly if you are short , stout , and toothsome . <p> " x0 ! " This time Hardhands ' voice , the voice which has launched a thousand stars , which has impregnated young girls with monsters and kept young men at their wanking until their wrists ache , is scorched and rather squeaky : <p> " Has anyone seen my wife ? " <p> II : HISTORICAL NOTES <p> Here is a bit of background . No ordinary night , tonight , not at all . It 's Pirates ' Parade and the City of Califa is afire - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , bucket brigades are out in force , for the Pontifexa does not wish to lose her capital to revelry . Wetness is stationed around the things that the Pontifexa most particularly requires not to burn : her shrines , Bilskinir House , Arden 's Cake-O-Rama , the Califa National Bank . Still , even with these bucket brigades acting as damper , there 's fun enough for everyone . The City celebrates many holidays , but surely Pirates ' Parade ranks as Biggest and Best . <p> But why pirates and how a parade ? Historians ( oh fabulous professional liars ) say that it happened thusly : Back in the day , no chain sealed off the Bay of Califa from seafaring foes , and the Califa Gate sprang wide as an opera singer 's mouth , a state of affairs good for trade and bad for security . Chain was not all the small city lacked : no guard , no organized militia , no bloodthirsty Scorcher Regiment to stand against havoc , and no Navy . The City was fledgling and disorganized , hardly more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine day , Pirates took advantage of Califa 's tenderness , sailed right through her Gate , and docked at the Embarcadero , as scurvy as you please . From door to door they went , demanding tribute or promising wrath , and when they were loaded down with booty they went well satisfied back to their ships to sail away . <p> But they did n't get far . While the pirates were shaking down the householders , a posse of quiet citizens crept down to the docks and sabotaged the poorly guarded pirate ships . The pirates arrived back at the docks to discover their escape boats sinking , and then suddenly the docks themselves were on fire and their way off the docks was blocked , and then they were on fire too , and that was it . <p> Perhaps Califa had no Army , no Navy , no Militia , but she did have citizens with grit and cleverness , and grit and cleverness trump greed and guns every time . Such a clever victory over a pernicious greedy foe is worth celebrating , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus was born a roistering day of remembrance when revelers dressed as pirates gallivant door to door demanding candy booty , and thus Little Tiny Doom has muscled in on Hardhands ' evening . With Grandmamma promised to attend a whist party , and Butler Paimon 's night off , who else would take Tiny Doom ( and the resplendently costumed Pig ) on candy shakedown ? Who but our hero , as soon as his show is over and his head back down to Earth , lucky boy ? <p> Well . <p> The Blue Duck and its hot dank club-y-ness may be the place to be when you are tall and trendy and your hearing is already shot , but for a short kidlet , big hair and loud noises bore , and the cigarillo smoke scratches . Tiny Doom has waited for Pirates ' Parade for weeks , dreaming of pink popcorn and sugar squidies , chocolate manikins and jacksnaps , praline pumpkin seeds and ginger bombs : a sackful of sugar guaranteed to keep her sick and speedy for at least a week . She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - trendy people look up their noses , not down . The potty is filthy and the floor yucky wet ; Tiny Doom and Pig slither out the door , right by Relais , so engaged in his conversation with a woman with a boat in her hair that he does n't even notice the scram . Around elbows , by tall boots , dodging lit cigarettes and drippy drinks held low and cool-like , Tiny Doom and Pig achieve open air without incident and then , sack in hand , set out for the Big Shakedown . <p> " Rancy Dancy is no good , " she sings as she goes , swinging Pig , who is of course , too lazy to walk , " Chop him up for firewood ... When he 's dead , boil his head and bake it into gingerbread ... " <p> She jumps over a man lying on the pavement , and then into the reddish pool beyond . The water makes a satisfying splash and tho ' her hem gets wet , she is sure to hold Pig up high so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad cold and has to care for his health , silly Pig , he is delicate , and up past his bedtime , besides . Well , it is only once a year . <p> Down the slick street , Tiny Doom galumphs , Pig swinging along with her . There are shadows ahead of her and shadows behind , but after the shadows of Bilskinir House ( which can sometimes be grabby ) these shadows : so what ? There 's another puddle ahead , this one jump over , rather than in . The puddle is wide , spreading across the street like a strange black stain . As she gears up for the leap , a faint rippling begins to mar the mirror-like surface . <p> " Wah ! Wah ! " Tiny Doom is short , but she has lift . Holding her skirt in one hand , and with a firm grip upon Pig , she hurtles herself upward and over , like a tiny tea cosy levering aloft . As she springs , something wavery and white snaps out of the stillness , cracking toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and keeps scooting . Six straggly fingers , like pallid parsnips , waggle angrily at her , but she 's well beyond their grip . <p> " Tell her , smell her ! Kick her down the cellar , " Tiny Doom taunts , flapping Pig 's ears derisively . The scraggly arm falls back , and then another emerges from the water , hoisting up on its elbows , pulling a slow rising bulk behind it : a knobby head , with knobby nose and knobby forehead and a slowly opening mouth that shows razor sharp gums and a pointy black tongue , unrolling like a hose . The tongue has length where the arms did not , and it looks gooey and sticky , just like the salt licorice Grandmamma loves so much . Tiny Doom cares not for salt licorice one bit and neither does Pig , so it seems prudent to punt , and they do , as fast as her chubby legs can carry them , farther down the slickery dark street . <p> III : IRRITATING CHILDREN <p> Here is Hardhands in the alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , which chills but does not calm . Inside , he has left an angry mob , who 've had their hopes dashed rather than their ears blown . The Infernal Engines of Desire ( opening act ) has come back on stage and is trying valiantly to suck up the slack , but the audience is not particularly pacified . The Blue Duck will be lucky if it does n't burn . However , that 's not our hero 's problem ; he 's got larger fish frying . <p> He sniffs the air , smelling : the distant salt spray of the ocean ; drifting smoke from some bonfire ; cheap perfume , - his own sweat ; horse manure . He closes his eyes and drifts deeper , beyond smell , beyond scent , down down down into a wavery darkness that is threaded with filaments of light which are not really light , but which he knows no other way to describe . The darkness down here is not really darkness either , it 's the Magickal Current as his mind can envision it , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . The Current bears upon its flow a tendril of something familiar , what he qualifies , for lack of a better word , as a taste of obdurate obstinacy and pink plush , fading quickly but unmistakable . <p> The Current is high tonight , very high . In consequence , the Aeyther is humming , the Aeyther is abuzz ; the line between In and Out has narrowed to a width no larger than a hair , and it 's an easy step across but the jump can go either way . Oh this would have been the very big whoo for the gig tonight ; musickal magick of the highest order , but it sucks for lost childer out on the streets . South of the Slot is bad enough when the Current is low : a sewer of footpads , dollymops , blisters , mashers , cornhoes , and others is not to be found elsewhere so deep in the City even on an ebbtide day . Tonight , combine typical holiday mayhem with the rising magickal flood and Goddess knows what will be out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And not even regular run-of-the-mill niblet , but prime grade A best grade royalty . The Pontifexa 's heir , it does n't get more yummy than that - a vampyre could dare sunlight with that bubbly blood zipping through his veins , a ghoul could pass for living after gnawing on that sweet flesh . It makes Hardhands ' manly parts shrivel to think upon the explanation to Grandmamma of Tiny Doom 's loss and the blame sure to follow . <p> Hardhands opens his eyes , it 's hardly worth wasting the effort of going deep when everything is so close to the surface tonight . Behind him , the iron door flips open and Relais flings outward , borne aloft on a giant wave of disapproving noise . The door snaps shut , cutting the sound in a brief echo that quickly dies in the coffin narrow alleyway . <p> " Did you find her ? " Relais asks , holding his fashionable cuffs so they do n't trail on the mucky cobblestones . Inside his brain is bouncing with visions of the Pontifexa 's reaction if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say is the least of his worries ; it is what she might do that really has Relais gagging . He likes his lungs exactly where they are : inside his body , not flapping around outside . <p> Hardhands turns a white-hot look upon his lover and says : " If she gets eaten , Relais , I will eat you . " <p> Relais 's father always advised saving for a rainy day and though the sky above is mostly clear , Relais is feeling damp . He will check his bankbook when they get home , and reconsider Sweetie Fyrdraaca 's proposition . He 's been Hardhands ' leman for more than a year now : blood sacrifices , coldfire-singed clothing , throat-tearing invocations , cornmeal gritty sheets , murder . He 's had enough . He makes no reply to the threat . <p> Hardhands demands , not very politely : " Give me my frockcoat . " <p> Said coat , white as snow , richly embroidered in white peonies and with cuffs the size of tablecloths , well , Relais had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague memory of hanging it over the stall door in the pisser , where hopefully it still dangles , hut prohahly not . <p> " I 'll get it - " Relais fades backward , into the club , and Hardhands lets him go . <p> For now . <p> For now , Hardhands takes off his enormous hat , which had remained perched upon his gorgeous head during his invocation via a jeweled spike of a hairpin , and speaks a word into its upturned bowl . A green light pools up , spilling over the hat 's capacious brim , staining his hand and the sleeve below with drippy magick . Another commanding word , and the light surges upward and ejects a splashy elemental , fish-tail flapping . <p> " Eh , boss - I thought you said I had the night off , " Alfonso complains . There 's lip rouge smeared on his fins and a clutch of cards in his hand . " It 's Pirates ' Parade . " <p> " I changed my mind . That wretched child has given me the slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfonso grimaces . Ever since Little Tiny Doom trapped him in a bowl of water and fed him fishy flakes for two days , he 's avoided her like fluke-rot . <p> " Why worry your good luck , boss - " <p> Hardhands does not have to twist . He only has to look like he is going to twist . Alfonso zips forward , flippers flapping , and Hardhands , after draining his chapeau of Current and slamming it back upon his grape , follows . <p> IV : WHO 'S THERE ? <p> Here is The Roaring Gimlet , sitting pretty in her cozy little kitchen , toes toasting on the grate , toast toasting on the tongs , drinking hot ginger beer , feeling happily serene . She 's had a fun-dandy evening . Citizens who normally sleep behind chains and steel bolts , dogs a-prowl and guns under their beds , who maybe would n't open their doors after dark if their own mothers were lying bleeding on the threshold , these people fling their doors widely and with gay abandon to the threatening cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rush . " <p> Any other night , at this time , she 'd still be out in the streets , looking for drunken greenhorns to roll . But tonight , all gates were a-jar and the streets a high tide of drunken louts . Out by nine and hack by eleven , with a sack almost too heavy to haul , a goodly load of sugar , and a yummy funtoy , too . Now she 's enjoying her happy afterglow from a night well-done . The noises from the cellar have finally stopped , she 's finished the crossword in The Aha Califa , and as soon as the kettle blows , she 'll fill her hot water bottle and aloft to her snuggly bed , there to dwell the rest of the night away in kip . <p> Ah , Pirates ' Parade , best night of the year . <p> While she 's waiting for the water to bubble , she 's cleaning the tool from whence comes her name : the bore is clotted with icky stuff and the Gimlet likes her signature clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , the Gimlet 's daddy always said . Above the fireplace , Daddy 's flat representation stares down at his progeny , the self-same gimlet clenched in his hand . The Roaring Gimlet is the heir to a fine family tradition and she does love her job . <p> What 's that a-jingling- She glances at the clock swinging over the stove . It 's almost midnight . Too late for visitors , and anyway , everyone knows the Roaring Gimlet 's home is her castle . Family stays in , people stay out , so Daddy Gimlet always said . Would someone ? No , they would n't . Not even tonight , they would not . <p> Jingle jingle . <p> The cat looks up from her perch on the fender , perturbed . <p> Heels down , the Gimlet stands aloft , and tucks her shirt back into her skirts , ties her dressing gown tight , bounds up the ladder-like kitchen stairs to the front door . The peephole shows a dimly lit circle of empty cobblestones . Damn it all to leave the fire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances again , jangling her into a surprised jerk . <p> The Roaring Gimlet opens the door , slipping the chain , and is greeted with a squirt of flour right in the kisser , and a shrieky command : <p> " Give us the Candy or we 'll give you the Rush ! " <p> The Gimlet coughs away the flour , choler rising , and beholds before her , knee-high , a huge black feathered hat . Under the hat is a pouty pink face , and under the pouty pink face , a fluffy farthingale that resembles in both color and points an artichoke , and under that , purple dance shoes , with crisscrossy ribands . Riding on the hip of this apparition is a large pink plushy pig , also wearing purple crisscrossy dance shoes , golden laurel leaves perched over floppy piggy ears . <p> It 's the Pig that the Gimlet recognizes first , not the kid . The kid , whose public appearances have been kept to a minimum ( the Pontifexa is wary of too much flattery , and as noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kid , but there is only one Pig , all Califa knows that , and the kid must follow the Pig , as day follows night , as sun follows rain , as fortune follows the fool . <p> " Give us the CANDY or we 'll GIVE YOU THE RUSH ! " A voice to pierce glass , to cut right through the Gimlet 's recoil , all the way down to her achy toes . The straw-shooter moves from present to fire ; while Gimlet was gawking , reloading had occurred , and another volley is imminent . She 's about to slam shut the door , she cares not to receive flour or to give out yum , but then , door-jamb held halfway in hand , she stops . An idea , formed from an over-abundance of yellow nasty novellas and an underabundance of good sense , has leapt full-blown from Nowhere to the Somewhere that is the Roaring Gimlet 's calculating brain . So much for sugar , so much for swag : here then is a price above rubies , above diamonds , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty price a pretty piece could fetch . On such proceeds the Gimlet could while away her elder days in endless sun and fun-toys . <p> Before the kid can blow again , the Gimlet grins , in her best granny way , flour feathering about her , and says , " Well , now , chickiedee , well now indeed . I 've no desire to be rushed , but you are late and the candy is- " <p> She recoils , but not in time , from another spurt of flour . When she wipes away the flour , she is careful not to wipe away her welcoming grin . " But I have more here in the kitchen , come in , tiny pirate , out of the cold , and we shall fill your sack full . " <p> " Huh , " says the child , already her husband 's Doom and about to become the Roaring Gimlet 's , as well . " GIVE ME THE CANDY - " <p> Patience is a virtue that the Roaring Gimlet is well off without . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people about but they are : drunken people , or burning people , or screaming people , or carousing people , or running people . None of them appear to be observant people , and that 's perfecto . The Gimlet reaches and grabs . <p> " Hey ! " says the Kid . The Pig does not protest . <p> Tiny Doom is stout , and she can dig her heels in , hut the Gimlet is stouter and the Gimlet has two hands free , where Tiny Doom has one , and the Pig is too flabby to help . Before Tiny Doom can shoot off her next round of flour , she 's yanked and the door is slammed shut behind her , bang ! <p> V. BAD HOUSEKEEPING <p> Here is Hardhands striding down the darkened streets like a colossus , dodging fire , flood , and fighting . He is not upset , oh no indeedy . He 's cool and cold and so angry that if he touched tinder it would burst into flames , if he tipped tobacco it would explode cherry red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , which is happy because the list of Hardhands ' blame is quite long . <p> Firstly : the Pontifexa for making him take Cyrenacia with him . What good is it to be her darling grandson when he 's constantly on doodie-detail ? Being the only male Hadraacfa should be good for : power , mystery , free booze , noli me tangere , first and foremost , the biggest slice of cake . Now being the only male Hadraada is good for : marrying small torments , kissing the Pontifexa 's ass , and being bossed into wife-sitting . He almost got Grandmamma once ; perhaps the decision should be revisited . <p> Secondly : Tiny Doom for not standing still . When he gets her , he 's going to paddle her , see if he does n't . She 's got it coming , a long time coming and perhaps a hot hinder will make her think twice about , well , think twice about everything . Did n't he do enough for her already ? He married her , to keep her in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty daddy , who otherwise would have the prior claim . Ungrateful kidlet . Perhaps she deserves whatever she gets . <p> Thirdly : Relais for being such an utter jackass that he ca n't keep track of a four-year-old . Hardhands has recently come across a receipt for an ointment that allows the wearer to walk through walls . For which , this sigil requires three pounds of human tallow . He 's got a few walls he would n't mind flitting right through and , at last , Relais will he useful . <p> Fourthly : Paimon . What need has a domicilie denizen for a night off anyway ? He 's chained to the physical confines of the House Bilskinir by a sigil stronger than life . He should be taking care of the Heir to the House Bilskinir , not doing whatever the hell he is doing on his night off which he should n't be doing anyway because he should n't be having a night off and when Hardhands is in charge , he wo n't , no sieur . <p> Fifthly : Pig . Ayah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plush toy , and can hardly be blamed for anything , but what the hell , why not ? Climb on up , Pig , there 's always room for one more ! <p> And ire over all : his ruined invocation , for which he had been purging starving dancing and flogging for the last two weeks , all in preparation for what would surely be the most stupendous summoning in the history of summoning . It 's been a stellar group of daemons that Hardhands has been able to force from the Aeyther before , but this time he had been going for the highest of the high , the loudest of the loud , and the show would have been sure to go down in the annals of musickoly and his name , already famous , would become gigantic in its shadow . And now .... <p> The streets are full of distraction but neither Hardhands nor Alfonso are distracted . Tiny Doom 's footprints pitty-patter before them , glowing in the gloam like little blue flowers , and they follow , avoiding burning brands , dead horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an impromptu cravat party and , because of their glowering concentration , they are avoided by all the aforementioned , in turn . The pretty blue footprints dance , and leap , from here to there , and there to here , over cobblestone and curb , around corpse and copse , by Cobweb 's Palace and Pete 's Clown Diner , by Ginger 's Gin Goint and Guerrero 's Helado , and other blind tigers so blind they are nameless also , dives so low that just walking by will get your knickers wet . The pretty prints do n't waver , do n't dilly-dally , and then suddenly , they turn toward a door , broad and barred , and they stop . <p> At the door , Hardhands does n't bother knocking , and neither does Alfonso , but their methods of entry differ . Alfonso zips through the wooden obstruction as though it is neither wooden nor obstructive . Hardhands places palm down on wood , and via a particularly loud Barbarick exhortation , blows the door right off its hinges . His entry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having blown off also in the breeze of Barbarick , but once it is firmly stabbed back on his handsome head , onward he goes , young Hardhands , hoping very much that something else will get in his path , because , he ca n't deny it : exploding things is Fun . <p> The interior of the house is dark and dull , not that Hardhands is there to critique the dcor . Alfonso has zipped ahead of him , coldfire frothing in his wake . Hardhands follows the bubbly pink vapor down a narrow hallway , past peeling paneling and dusty doorways . He careens down creaky stairs , bending head to avoid braining on low ceiling , and into a horrible little kitchen . <p> He wrinkles his nose . Our young hero is used to a praeterhuman amount of cleanliness , and here there is neither . At Bilskinir House even the light looks as though it 's been washed , dried , and pressed before hung in the air . In contrast , this poky little hole looks like the back end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ear . Smashed crockery and blue willow china crunches under boot , and the furniture is bonfire ready . A faint glow limns the wreckage , the after-reflection of some mighty big magick . The heavy sour smell of blackberries wrinkles , in his nose . Coldfire dribbles from the ceiling , whose plaster cherubs and grapes look charred and withered . <p> Hardhands pokes at a soggy wad of clothes lying in a heap on the disgusting floor . For one testicle-shriveling moment he thought he saw black velvet amongst the sog ; he does , but it 's a torn shirt , not a puffy hat . <p> All magickal acts leave a resonance behind , unless the magician takes great pains to hide : Hardhands knows every archon , hierophant , sorceress , bibliomatic , and avatar in the City , but he does n't recognize the author of this Working . He catches a drip of coldfire on one long finger and holds it up to his lips : salt-sweet-smoky - oddly familiar but not enough to identify . <p> " Pigface pogo ! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide and almost gone face down in a smear of glass and black goo - mashy blackberry jam , the source of the sweet stench . Flailing unheroically , he regains his balance , but in doing so , grabs at the edge of an overturned settle . The settle has settled backward , cockeyed on its back feet , but Hardhands ' leverage rocks it forward again , and , hello , here 's the Gimlet - well , parts of her anyway . She is stuck to the bench by a flood of dried blood , and the expression on her face is doleful , and a little bit surprised . <p> " Pogo pigface on a pigpogopiss ! Who the hell is that ? " <p> Alfonso yanks the answer from the Aethyr . " The Roaring Gimlet , petty roller and barn stamper . You see her picture sometimes in the post office . " <p> " She do n't look too roaring to me . What the hell happened to her ? " <p> Alfonso zips closer , while Hardhands holds his sleeve to his sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sickening sweet smell of the crushed blackberries , and together a pleasuring perfume they do not make . <p> " Me , I think she was chewed , " Alfonso announces after close inspection . " By something hungry and mad . " <p> " What kind of something ? " <p> Alfonso shrugs . " Nobody I know . Sorry , boss . " <p> As long as Doom is not chewed , Hardhands cares naught for the chcwyness of others . He uneasily illuminates the fetid shadows with a vivid Barbarick phrase , but thankfully no rag-like wife does he see , tossed aside like a discarded tea towel , nor red wet stuffy Pig-toy , only bloody jam and magick-bespattered walls . He 'd never admit it , particularly not to a yappy servitor , but there 's a warm feeling of relief in his toes that Cyrenacia and Pig were not snacked upon . But if they were not snacked upon , where the hell are they , oh irritation . <p> There , in the light of his sigil - sign : two dainty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then headed up the back stairs , the shimmer of Bilskinir blue shining faintly through the rusty red . Whatever got the Gimlet did not get his wife and pig , that for sure , that 's all he cares about , all he needs to know , and the footprints are fading , too : onward . <p> At the foot of the stairs , Hardhands poises . A low distant noise drifts out of the floor below , like a bad smell , a rumbly agonized sound that makes his tummy wiggle . <p> " What is that ? " <p> A wink of Alfonso 's tails and top hat and here 's his answer : " There 's some guy locked in the cellar , and he 's - he 's in a bad way , and I think he needs our help - " <p> Hardhands is not interested in guys locked in cellars , nor in their bad ways . The footprints are fading , and the Current is still rising , he can feel it jiggling in his veins . Badness is on the loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Goddess Califa knows what else , and Tiny Doom is alone . <p> VI : SUGAR SWEET <p> Here is Hardhands , hot on the heels of the pretty blue footsteps skipping along through the riotous streets . Hippy-hop , pitty-pat . The trail takes a turning , into a narrow alley and Hardhands turns with it , leaving the sputtering street lamps behind . Before the night was merely dark : now it 's darkdarkdark . He flicks a bit of coldfire from his fingertips , blossoming a ball of luminescence that weirdly lights up the crooked little street , broken cobbles and black narrow walls . The coldfire ball bounces onward , and Hardhands follows . The footprints are almost gone : In a few more moments they will be gone ; for a lesser magician they would be gone already . <p> And then , a drift of song : <p> " Hot corn , hot corn ! Buy my hot corn ! <p> Lovely and sweet , Lovely and Warm ! " <p> Out of the shadow comes a buttery smell , hot and wafting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot Corn Dolly , out on the prowl . The perfume is delightful and luscious and it reminds Hardhands that dinner was long since off . But Hardhands does not eat corn ( while not fasting , he 's on an all meat diet , for to clean his system clear of sugar and other poisons ) , and when the hot Corn Dolly wiggles her tray at him , her green-ribboned braids dancing , he refuses . <p> The Corn Dolly is not alone , her sisters stand behind her , and their wide trays , and the echoing wide width of their farthingale skirts , flounced with patchwork , jingling with little bells , form a barricade that Hardhands , the young gentleman , can not push through . The Corn Dolly skirts are wall-to-wall and their ranks are solid and only rudeness will make a breach . <p> " I cry your pardon , ladies , " he says , in feu de joie , ever courteous , for is not the true mark of a gentleman his kindness toward others , particularly his inferiors ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Buy my hot com , deliriously sweet , <p> Gives joy to the sorrowful and strength to the weak . " <p> The Dolly 's voice is luscious , ripe with sweetness . In one small hand she holds an ear of corn , dripping with butter , fragrant with the sharp smell of chile and lime , bursting up from its peeling of husk like a flower , and this she proffers toward him . Hardhands feels a southerly rumble , and suddenly his mouth is full of anticipatory liquid . Dinner was a long long time ago , and he has always loved hot corn , and how can one little ear of corn hurt him ? And anyway , do n't he deserve some solace ? He fumhles in his pocket , but no divas does he slap ; he 's the Pontifcxa 's grandson , and not in the habit of paying for his treats . <p> The Dolly sees his gesture and smiles . Her lips are glistening golden , as yellow as her silky hair , and her teeth , against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A kiss for the corn , and corn for a kiss , <p> One sweet with flavor , the other with bliss , " she sings , and the other dollies join in her harmony , the bells on their square skirts jingling . The hot corn glistens like gold , steamy and savory , dripping with yum . A kiss is a small price to pay to sink his teeth into savory . He 's paid more for less and he leans forward , puckering . <p> The dollies press in , wiggling their oily fingers and humming their oily song , enfolding him in the husk of their skirts , their hands , their licking tongues . His southerly rumble is now a wee bit more southerly , and it 's not a rumble , it 's an avalanche . The corn rubs against his lips , slickery and sweet , spicy and sour . The chile burns his lips , the butter soothes them , he kisses , and then he licks , and then he bites into a bliss of crunch , the squirt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tasted anything better , and he bites again , eagerly , butter oozing down his chin , dripping onto his shirt . Eager fingers stroke his skin , he 's engorged with the sugar-sweetness , so long denied , and now he ca n't get enough , each niblet exploding bright heat in his mouth , his tongue , his head , he 's drowning in the sweetness of it all . <p> And like a thunder from the Past , he hears ringing in his head the Pontifexa 's admonition , oft repeated to a whiny child begging for hot corn , spun sugar , spicy taco or fruit cup , sold on the street , in rnarvelous array but always denied because : you never know where it 's been . An Admonition drummed into his head with painful frequency , all the other kidlets snacked from the street vendors with reckless abandon , but not the Pontifexa 's grandson , whose turn was deemed too delicate for common food and the common bugs it might contain . <p> Drummed well and hard it would seem , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than never . Hardhands snaps open eyes and sputters kernels . Suddenly he sees true what the Corn Dollies ' powerful glamour have disguised under a patina of butter and spice : musky kernels and musky skin . A fuzz of little black flics encircles them . The silky hair , the silky husks are slick with mold . The little white corn teeth grin mottled blue and green , and corn worms spill in a white wiggly waterfall from gaping mouths . <p> " Arrgg , " says our hero , managing to keep the urp down , heroically . He yanks and flutters , pulls and yanks , but the knobby fingers have him firm , stalk to stalk . He heaves , twisting his shoulders , spinning and ducking : now they have his shirt , but he is free . <p> IMG
