Section : THE BEST OF THE BOWL SEASON WIDE RECEIVERS Mark Clayton , Oklahoma <p> Before the map : Oklahoma uses multiple sets for Clayton , looking for mismatches in man coverage . Depending on the play and formation , he can play outside or in the slot OU uses him in motion to detect man or zone coverage and uses option routes to get the best possible matchup . <p> Getting off the line : Clayton has the best first step of any receiver in the country . He uses a variety of moves , hand swipes and deception to create separation at the line . Once he gets by the comer , the damage is done . <p> Locking hima down : The dilemma for every defensive coordinator : Crowd Clayton or give him room ? If a defense plays zone , it better have a safety who is fast enough to cut off Clayton after his release from the comerback , bracketing Clayton and keeping him from turning a 10- to 12-yard pattern into something much bigger . If a defense plays man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 5 to 7 yards of the route and force quarterback Jason White to go to his next read . The safest play is a zone because it keeps Clayton in front of the defense and eventually surrounds him . But that also means letting Clayton catch a pass in space , where he can get significant yards after the catch with his speed and moves . <p> Getting to his head : Clayton gets agitated and thrown off his game when the ball is n't coming his way early . OU invariably presses to get him the ball - usually on streak routes - and takes him away from what he does best : making catches in traffic and making defenders miss . <p> Advance scoring : Says one Big 12 defensive coordinator " Clayton can turn a 5-yard out into a 60-yard touchdown before you blink . He has incredible balance and hips like Elvis . You 've got to have your strong safety hit him early and hard and make him think about what 's going to happen once he catches It Then get as many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Height : 5-11 <p> Weight : 187 <p> Class : Junior 79 catches , 1,393 yards , 17.6 yards per catch , 15 touchdowns Michael Claton , LSU <p> Before the snap : Clayton is the split end , usually lining up wide of the line . But the Tigers occasionally line him in the slot - the goal is to keep him from getting double-teamed , and there 's a greater possibility of that happening outside . <p> Getting off the line : The tall , lanky Clayton Is not necessarily intimidating at the line . But he 's superb technically and uses his size as leverage to fend off cornerbacks in the early stages of the route , then uses his long stride to gain separation . Any comer who ca n't stay close early will pay seconds later . <p> Locking him down : Forget about zone coverage . Clayton can leap and go after the ball as well as anyone this side of Larry Fitgerald , and his M frame plays like 6-11 when the ball Is In the air . The best chance to disrupt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keiwan Ratliff pushed , pulled and held dayton nearly every snap and limited him to five catches for 60 yards . The more he 's knocked off his route , the more the shaky accuracy of quarterback Matt Mauck comes into play . Play tight and force Clayton to stay outside the hash marte and away from the middle of the field - where there 's space to work and too many opportunities for Clayton to adjust to a poor throw . <p> Getting in his head : It wo n't be easy - he 's very even-tempered and patient in the Tigers ' run-oriented offense . LSU knows teams want to get physical , and coordinator Jimbo Rsher usually responds with crossing routes and picks that take advantage of the speed of Clayton and receiver Devery Henderson in the middle of the field and force safeties to choose earlier on double-coverage checks . <p> Advance scoring : Says one SEC defensive coordinator " They 're very good at finding ways to get him Involved . They want him going over the middle because he catches anything dose to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those intermediate curls and crosses , then hit you with a stop-and-go and take advantage of aggressive coverage . Once they get you in that spot all Mauck has to do is throw it up ( deep ) , and Clayton will go get it . " <p> Height : 6-4 <p> Wright : 197 <p> Class : Junior 74 catches , 1,041 yards , 14.1 yards per catch , 10 touchdowns QUARTERBACKS Jason White , Oklahoma <p> Presnap read : Oklahoma spreads the field and frequently uses the shotgun for two key reasons . Its line is more of a pass-blocking unit and can employ less physical zone techniques when running out of the shotgun . More important , the shotgun enables White to find mismatches In coverage . <p> Under pressure : Some teams like to play zone and force White to make good decisions ( they 'd better be able to tackle after the catch ) ; others think he 's susceptible to a rush and will force poor throws ( they 'd better be able to deal with his accuracy ) . In the Big 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles with some blitzing in front of the coverages to fool White . But its defensive line did a majority of the damage and allowed the Wildcats to drop anywhere from five to eight in coverage in pass situations . <p> Advance scoring : Says a Big 12 defensive coordinator . " If you can pressure him and bracket Mark Qayton , he has to follow his progressions . He wants to throw to Clayton . If you have the speed , you Witz from Clayton 's side and roll coverage behind it . Then he has to look elsewhere or make a bad decision . <p> Height : 6-2 <p> Weight : 221 <p> Class : Senior 265-of-414 passing , 3,744 yards , 40 touchdowns , 8 interceptions , 168.0 rating Matt Mauck , LSU <p> Presnap read : LSU wants to run early and follow with play-action to force the defense 's back seven to respect the pass . Mauck will run out of the shotgun , but he 's not nearly as effective when the defense knows he has to throw . Successful play-action usually guarantees at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure : Mauck Is mobile and can hurt opponents If he breaks containment He 's also a tough runner who wo n't go down easily . But he 's not a particularly accurate passer , and pressure only compounds the problem . OU 's zone biltzes will confuse LSU and force turnovers if the Tigers do n't first establish the run and slow the pressure . <p> Advance scouting : Says an SEC defensive coordinator : " I love his intangibles . He 's 24 years old . he 's smart , he 's not going to get rattled . But he has problems reading zone coverages . He has gotten better about moving and sliding in the pocket and waiting for routes to come open , but there are times when he still leaves too early . Make him think ; force him into quick decisions .

The Sooners use twists and stunts to get him free . <p> Do n't lose slight : He 's basically a big linebacker with speed and athleticism and the ability to chase down plays beyond the point of attack . <p> Advance scouting : Says one Big 12 offensive coordinator : " He gets doubled - he still makes plays . You slant toward him to take him out of the play - he still makes plays . The key is to make him overpursue . " <p> Height : 6-3 <p> Weight : 289 <p> Class : Junior 34 tackles , 9 tackles for loss ( 4 sacks ) , 19 quarterback hurries Chad Lavalas , LSU <p> Better get help : Good upper-body strength allows him to split doubleteams , particularly in key situations . As one SEC coach says , " He hits overdrive when it 's third-and-long . " <p> Do n't lose sight : The Tigers have so much speed and dynamic ability at the other spots on the line that Lavalais can freelance with twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Advance scouting : An SEC offensive coordinator says : " There are times on tape when he looks like he 's tired , then he drags himself to the line and - boom ! - his initial burst at the snap is insane . " <p> Height : 6-3 <p> Weight : 292 <p> Class : Senior 57 tackles , 16 tackles for loss ( 7 sacks ) , 23 quarterback hurries DEFENSIVE ENDS Dan Cody , Oklahoma <p> Off the edge : A quick first step and dosing speed make him difficult to block in man situations . His moves still are limited , but the few he has work consistently . <p> Neutralizing factor : Play him to the outside and force him to run past the quarterback drop . He does n't have much of an Inside swim move . <p> Advance scouting : A Big 12 offensive coordinator says : " He 's a lot stronger than you think he is , but If you can chip with a tight end or fullback , you can take him out .

Strong technique - footwork , arm and waist alignment - works if there 's time to set up . " Oklahoma Defining games <p> September 6 at Alabama . Playing on the road against a dangerous Crimson Tide team that had nothing to lose because it was on probation , Oklahoma got its closest victory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason White made big plays and showed he was healthy after having his previous two seasons ended by knee injuries . <p> October 11 vs . Texas . A fourth consecutive win over the Longhorns solidified Oklahoma 's status as the premier national title contender . In dismantling the Longhorns , 65-13 , the Sooners took advantage of myriad Texas blunders , showing an opportunistic style that would benefit the team later in the season . Also , wideout Mark Clayton had a schoolrecord 190 receiving yards and emerged as a valuable big-play threat . <p> October 25 at Colorado . This contest taught Oklahoma to keep its guard up . The Sooners built a 27-7 third quarter lead , only to watch the Buffaloes storm back . But instead of crumbling on the road after CU pulled to within 27-20 late in the game , White hit Clayton for a 41-yard touchdown strike to seal the 34-20 victory . TABLE LSU Defining games <p> September 20 vs . Georgia . LSU displayed the bigplay ability it would need later in the season in downing the Bulldogs , 17-10 . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the Bayou Bengals ' last score that proved the biggest , as quarterback Matt Mauck hit Skyler Green from 34 yards out with 3:03 remaining for the deciding score . Credit also was due the LSU defense , which continually hounded Georgia quarterback David Greene . <p> October 11 vs . Florida . The game taught LSU it ca n't take any opponent for granted . The Tigers entered the matchup 5-0 and ranked No. 6 in the nation . Florida arrived limping , its season on the brink at 3-3 . But the Gators ' strong defense and timely passes downfield - and many LSU penalties - were the difference in Florida 's 19-7 upset victory . LSU has n't lost since . <p> November 22 at Mississippi . Mauck overcame three interceptions and helped the Tigers to a 17-14 win , but it was defense that won this game for LSU . Rebels quarterback Eli Manning was held to just 16of-36 passing for 200 yards and an interception . It also helped LSU that stellar Ole Miss kicker Jonathan Nichols missed field-goal attempts from 47 and 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be lucky to be good . TABLE Key match ups : OU offense vs . LSU defense <p> C Vince Carter vs . Dt Chad Lavalis . Carter , who wont't get Lavalais every snap but often will provide help , may be the most athletic center in the nation . He 's able to execute the reach block as well as anyone . good thing , because dealing with the quickshifting , high-energy Lavalais will be a chore . The nam who stays lowest most often wins , and it 's hard to burrow out Lavalis . <p> WR Mark Clyton vs . CB Corey Webster . Clayton has a sprinter 's speed and a burglar 's fearlessness to go with proper mechanics . Webster ca n't be passive . He must bump clayton at the line while keeping an eye on the ball . Playing a safety over the top may be a good idea . If Clayton gets an inch of daylight , he turns it into a mile of pasture . <p> RB Kejuan Jones vs . FS LaRon Landry . Landry , a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a physical nature that belies his age . He 'll have to keep close tabs on Jones , a shifty sort who gets lost behind the big gallots up fron . The Sooners may try to make Landry pay for being overaggressive by going up over top of him . Once Landry backs off the lines , Jones could strike for a big gain . <p> QB Janson White vs . LB Lionel Turner . White is n't prone to take off and run after two knee injuries , but he still must be accounted for . Once out of the pocket , he 's able to draw defensive backs toward the line . That 's when a Sooners wideout can slip behind the defense . Turner needs to spy White 's eyes and look for keys and tendencies . Most of all if White does cros the line of scrimmage , Turner has to hit him hard . <p> OT Jammal Brown vs . DE Marcus Spears . Brown grades out as one of the Sooners ' top linemen this season . He 's an athletic tackle strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long arms to keep Spears at bay . To counter , Spears must keep Brown guessing by alternating between a wide speed rush and quick countermove inside . He even may be able to overpower Brown against the run . Key matchups : LSU offense vs . OU defense <p> G Stephen Peterman vs . Dt Tommie Harris , . Like most guards , Peterman is n't very athletic , but be excels at using his strength to battle in small spaaces . Harris must avoid getting swallowed up while using his muscle to combat his lack of mammoth grith . His combination of athleticism and initial burst often confounds lumbering guards . Peeterman may be overmatched . <p> WR Michael Clayton vs . CB Derrick Strait . Clayton lacks great jets , but he 's fealess over the middle . That 's why many believe he 'd be a good defensive back . he also has sticky mitts . Strait is physical enouth to knowk receivers of their routes and fast enough to make up ground lost by being aggressive . He needs to gets in Clayton 's way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan Cody . <p> Whitworth is a man-child who started as a freshman in 2002 . He has the body to engulf defenders but he must stay low . Cody needs to be smart and rely on his relentless motor to get to Whitworth 's outside shoulder and on his great strength to knock Whitworth off-balance . RB Justin Vincent vs . SS Donte Nicholson . <p> Vincent is a threat to go the distance each time he touches the ball . Nicholson has to contain Vincent and not let him get the edge . Nicholson , a former junior college player , is a hard hitter who has drawn comparisons to former Sooners saftey Roy Williams . A few hard knocks may temper Vincent 's enthusiasm for running hard . <p> QB Matt Mauck vs . LB Teddy Lehman . Mauck is n't a great athlete , but the former minor league catcher is nifty enough to make the first guy miss . Lehman has unparalleled speed for his position , exceling at forcing action inside , where pursuit can clean up . It 's vital that Lehman and conpany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good decisions .
