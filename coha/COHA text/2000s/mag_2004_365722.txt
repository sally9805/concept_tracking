ELTON JOHN is starting to remind us of that curmudgeonly relative who blurts out what everyone else is really thinking at the family reunion . While accepting a songwriting award in London last week , the elder rocker , 57 , griped that he could n't believe Madonna had been nominated for best live act . " Since when has lip synching been live ? " John asked . " Madonna , best expletive live act ? Expletive off . " Last month John called a group of Taiwanese paparazzi who ambushed him " rude , vile pigs . " And last spring he called the reality show American Idol " racist " after two black contestants were eliminated . The Rocket Man 's recent sounding off could be a publicity stunt , or his cheekiness magnified by age and wealth  --  or an audition for Andy Rooney 's spot on 60 Minutes .
