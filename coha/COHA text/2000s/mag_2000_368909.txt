Sooner or later we all discover that our arms just are n't long enough to read anymore . You know the problem . You ca n't focus on the small type in books and magazines and on aspirin bottles at your normal reading distance , and so you start moving the print farther and farther away . If you have n't already experienced this trombone effect , do n't worry , you will . Starting around age 40 , the lenses in most people 's eyes start to weaken . You begin to lose the ability to focus on things close up and have to resort to bifocals or reading glasses to make out the fine print . ( The moderately nearsighted can often make do until age 50 by taking off their corrective lenses . ) <P> Since a pair of prescription glasses in stylish frames can cost $100 or more , you may have considered picking up a pair of drugstore reading glasses . These are essentially magnifying glasses of varying strengths that often cost $15 to $20 . For once , this is a shortcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , under the right circumstances , drugstore glasses can be just as effective as prescription reading glasses . <P> There are , however , several things you need to keep in mind . Reading glasses are not the same as the glasses used to correct nearsightedness ( the ability to see nearby objects better than those that are far away ) , farsightedness ( the ability to see objects that are farther away somewhat better than those that are nearby ) or astigmatism ( a kind of warping of the outer layers of the eye ) . Because of the more complicated optics involved , you need prescription lenses or contacts to compensate for any of the three conditions . Drugstore reading glasses , which contain two lenses of identical magnification , wo n't help if one eye is significantly weaker than the other . Nor will they help you drive better or see a movie screen . <P> For other uses , if the cheap glasses work for you , go ahead and use them . " I have some over-the-counter reading glasses myself , " says Dr. Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California at Irvine . " They can be very convenient . " <P> So what , besides attractive frames and a comfortable fit , should you look for ? Mostly it 's a process of trial and error . Bring some of your typical reading material to the store to see which magnification you need . ( If you do a lot of computer work , you may want a separate , slightly weaker pair of glasses , since most computer screens are n't placed within normal reading range . ) Probably the trickiest part of selecting the right pair of reading glasses is making sure the lenses are correctly centered over the eyes . Misalignment can cause headaches and eyestrain . Any qualified eye-care provider can check this for you . Many will even tell you which magnification to look for . <P> And it never hurts to use a little common sense . If you ca n't find a pair of drugstore glasses that work for your eyes , you probably need to give up and pay for a prescription pair . Even if you find a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use that as an excuse to skip regular eye exams . There are other conditions  --  such as glaucoma  --  for which you should be checked . Consider the money you save on drugstore glasses as partial payment for your next trip to the eye doctor . <P> For more on reading glasses , focus on our website at
