<p> Gilbert Arenas was standing in a hallway outside the Warriors ' locker room Wednesday when he was bombarded with more attention than the Lakers ' defense had paid him minutes earlier . <p> " Please stay , Gilbert , " a supporter wearing Arenas ' No. 0 jersey said . <p> " Playoffs next year , Gil , " another fan said , drawing cheers from those around him . " It 's going to happen with you here . " <p> If only the formula were that easy : Re-sign Arenas , the 21-year-old with All-Star potential , and end an NBA-high nine-year playoff drought . <p> Leaping into the playoffs in a conference so loaded it should be featured in Forbes magazine will require more than bringing back the Warriors ' starting point guard and second-leading scorer . The Warriors must improve defensively and have their young players continue to develop , and even then they could struggle to break into the top eight in the West . <p> That they are entertaining questions about taking the next step results from a season in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an entertaining style of play and fulfilled one of rookie coach Eric Musselman 's main objectives by earning the opposition 's respect . The Warriors even received the NBA commissioner 's seal of approval for their most successful season since 1993-94 . <p> " The fans in the Bay Area are great fans , " David Stern said Thursday on Jim Rome 's radio show . " They have supported our teams there through the thick and the thin . And finally , after what they probably think are so many broken promises . . . and finally , the players who are probably wondering whether they are all going to put it together , just come together this year . <p> " I just know that going into next year , they are going to believe in themselves and they 're going to say , ' We can compete . ' I love to see that turnaround situation . " <p> Despite losing their final four games and going 8-14 after reaching the .500 mark at 30-30 , the Warriors closed with 17 more victories than last season with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidence . The Warriors jelled so well under Musselman that general manager Garry St. Jean sees no reason for significant change . <p> " I really believe we have a lot of quality pieces in place , " St. Jean said . " If everyone takes care of business , we 're at the point now where we add a little here , add a little there , and that 's terrific . If you said to me that we came back next year and had this roster and a draft pick , would I be disappointed ? Not at all . With that said , we 'll do everything we can , if we can better it , we will . " <p> Any upgrade starts on the defensive end , where the Warriors permitted a league-high 103.6 points a game and tied for 22nd in opponents ' field-goal percentage , the latter category widely considered a more accurate measure of performance . <p> The Warriors overcame those shortcomings many nights with the NBA 's second-highest scoring offense . When they failed to score at least 100 points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consist of shot-blocking centers Erick Dampier and Adonal Foyle and hard-nosed backup guard Bob Sura . <p> " You have to have the mind-set of wanting to shut people down , not just going out there and trying to outscore people , " Sura said . " That 's something some guys need to work on if we 're going to get better . " <p> " The overwhelming response to the question " of how the Warriors build on a 38-win season , St. Jean said , " is that we have to become a better defensive team . It is n't done with one person or the coach making a statement . It 's going to be a collective effort , a collective commitment by everybody . <p> " We 'll be in quest , if it will better the club in transactions , focusing on anybody who might have a defensive presence about him . And we 'll be working with the guys we have . " <p> That work yielded results last offseason when Troy Murphy , with the help of director of athletic development Mark Grabow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power forward . The Warriors will need similarly dramatic improvement this offseason from players such as shooting guard Jason Richardson and small forward Mike Dunleavy to set up a playoff run . <p> As much as they progressed with second-year players Arenas , Murphy and Richardson starting and rookie Dunleavy at the back end of the rotation , the 11th-place Warriors finished ahead of only three teams in the West . They were 11-29 against the 10 in front of them , including sweeps to Sacramento , Dallas and Portland , and ended six games behind eighth-place Phoenix . <p> " This playoff stuff , the topic is coming up . But we still have ( three ) teams ( No. 10 Seattle , No. 9 Houston and the Suns ) we have to jump to even make it , " Musselman said , not to mention having to contend with the New Orleans Hornets , who are expected to switch conferences in 2004-05 . <p> " We have our work cut out for us . We 're not going to sneak up on anybody next year . We sneaked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . Next year , opening tip , teams are going to be ready for us , because the Golden State Warriors players have gained the respect of other people around the league . Once people respect you , it becomes even tougher to win games . " <p> Tougher still without a point guard . As Musselman said , the Warriors have " two open blocks " at the position because Arenas is set to become a restricted free agent and backup Earl Boykins will be an unrestricted free agent July 1 . <p> The Warriors are allowed to match an outside team 's offer to Arenas up to the midlevel exception , which is expected to be in the $4.6 million to $5 million range . Arenas said he wants to resolve his status as quickly as possible ; free agents can begin signing contracts July 16 . <p> " Yeah , I would love that , " Arenas said . " It would be easier for me , easier for the team . Hopefully , I can get it done the first day of free agency .

The Warriors ( 38-44 ) matched their win total from the previous two seasons combined and stayed alive in the playoff race for 79 games . Eric Musselman , the franchise 's eighth coach since 1995 , guided the Warriors to the NBA 's biggest improvement ( 17 more victories than last season ) . <p> 2 . Four starters played all 82 games while the fifth , power forward Troy Murphy , missed two games with a bruised right knee and one because of an NBA suspension . No need for the likes of Bill Curley , John Coker and Chris Garner this season . <p> 3 . The Warriors finished 19-11 against the Eastern Conference , including 13-2 at home . They were 24-17 overall at the Arena in Oakland . " I think we got to the point where if we lost in our building , we felt like we missed a chance for a win , " Musselman said . <p> The Bad <p> 1 . GM Garry St. Jean envisioned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up playing behind Antawn Jamison , the team 's leading scorer and highest-paid player , instead of with him in the starting frontcourt . Dunleavy 's minutes ( 15.9 per game ) and opportunities to work through mistakes were limited . One issue that could surface is how the Warriors will make room for Dunleavy if he proves ready for starter 's minutes next season . <p> 2 . Danny Fortson did not attend a mandatory exit interview with Musselman on Thursday , a fitting ending to a season in which he either was not around  --  he did not play in 20 games for reasons other than a coach 's decision , including the final four because of a team-imposed suspension  --  or not on the court ( 45 DNP-CDs ) . <p> 3 . Second-round pick Steve Logan has not signed . The Warriors still own his draft rights . <p>  --  Brad WeinsteinE-mail Brad Weinstein at **26;775;TOOLONG
