Their Son // * * * // His birth at home , on October 14 , 1894 , was not easy , as his mother 's meticulous journal entries testify : // Held on to Edward and tugged-About 5 towels were arranged and I tugged as hard as possible-Later part of P.M. took lots of gruel-Miss McMahon saw child 's hair at 4-Tug of war till 6 then very reluctantly took ether as Dr. Hildreth said it would be bad for the child to wait longer-Dr . Taylor gave the ether ( 20 minutes ) . Then Dr. Hildreth delivered the child with forceps-Boy born at 7-weighed 8 3/4 + pounds ... I was torn and so Dr. Hildreth sewed me up-not more than 8 stitches-no ether . // For ten days , " the boy was fed on milk and water-Persistent efforts of Miss McMahon to put boy on breast &amp; with help of Phoenix nipple shield finally succeeded .

" Even this milestone did not elicit a formal recording of the child 's name ; his mother simply began to use her son 's middle name , Estlin , in her subsequent diary notes . Apparently , neither she nor her husband ever called their son Edward , his actual first name . No , Edward was clearly Edward the father , Harvard instructor in sociology , eminent man of learning and accomplishment . The child , Edward Estlin Cummings , should never be confused with his father , despite their shared first names . // Indeed , Edward Cummings was a formidable figure . At the time of his son 's birth he was , at thirty-three , a largely self-made man , descended from a long line of New England farmers , tradesman , and shopkeepers-people who valued skill with one 's hands over formal education . His earliest American ancestors were Isaac Cummings from Ipswich , Massachusetts , who in 1638 purchased land in Topsfield , Massachusetts , and on his mother 's side , Nathaniel Merrill , who settled in Newbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cummingses and Merrills eventually made their way to Colebrook , New Hampshire . In the late 1840s , Sherburn Rowell Merrill became the owner of grist and starch mills . In the late 1850s , he went into the general store business with Edward Norris Cummings , the young son of an enterprising local tavern-keeper . Not long after forming their partnership , Merrill 's oldest daughter , Lucretia Frances Merrill , married Edward Norris Cummings . In 1861 , in Colebrook , their son Edward Cummings was born . // Estlin 's grandfather , Edward Norris Cummings , was a stern Congregationalist of the " hellfire variety " who ruled over his household with an iron fist . He took much less interest in his son 's education beyond that of learning how to use tools . As a consequence , Edward did not attend school until he was eight , and then only at Lucretia 's insistence . // Around 1870 Edward Norris Cummings moved his family to Woburn , Massachusetts . Though Edward was allowed to attend school , he was also expected to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carpenter , and throughout his years at Woburn High School held down a variety of carpentry jobs . But all that changed when , in 1879 , he was admitted to Harvard , becoming the first in his family to pursue higher education . He excelled in his undergraduate studies in economics , philosophy , and political science , graduating magna cum laude in 1883. // After graduation he enrolled in Harvard Law School , but changed direction after one term and entered Harvard Divinity School , where he hoped to combine his interest in social work with the ministry . He received his AM in Divinity in 1885 . By this point , however , he was somewhat disillusioned with his course of study , for he found that his interest in ministering to the poor and oppressed did not fit particularly well with the school 's program that emphasized theology and pulpit studies over social issues . And while he could have obtained a position in one of the local Boston or Cambridge churches , his attraction to learning led him to continue his studies of the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was also employed as a graduate assistant in the English department , and from 1887-88 served as Instructor in English . // Perceived by his professors as a rising star , he was awarded , in 1888 , the first six hundred dollar Robert Treat Paine Fellowship " to study ethical problems of society and the efforts ... to ameliorate the lot of the masses of mankind . " He chose to study in Europe . This was not the only honor he received that year . One of his teachers , William James , thought so highly of the young bachelor that he took it upon himself to introduce him to a young Bostonian named Rebecca Haswell Clarke , the rather shy twenty-nine-year-old granddaughter of a family friend , John Jones Clarke , former mayor of Roxbury , Massachusetts , and at that time a member of the Massachusetts State Legislature . Miss Clarke made quite an impression on Edward Cummings . Though he went on to Europe , they exchanged numerous letters during his three years abroad . // During Edward 's residency in Europe , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers in England , France , Germany , and Italy . In London , he worked under Reverend Samuel Barnett at the Toynbee Hall settlement house , and at Oxford , studied under Professor J. Estlin Carpenter . Carpenter , a professor of social work and religion , was a pioneering thinker in the new field of sociology , and quickly became a mentor so important that Edward would not only later give his child the middle name of Estlin , but also ask Professor Carpenter to be the child 's godfather . // After studies at the University of Berlin and the University of Paris , he returned to Cambridge , Massachusetts , ( and Rebecca ) in 1891 . After securing an appointment at Harvard as Instructor in Political Economy , he felt worthy to ask Rebecca Clarke to marry him . She happily agreed , and on June 25 , 1891 , they were married in Boston . That fall he began teaching the college 's first course in sociology . The following year , with the establishment of sociology as an area of study , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time his son was born in 1894 , he was well on his way to becoming an eminent Harvard professor . // In Cummings 's eyes , his father was , of course , not just the sum of his resum ? or ancestry . His own description focuses on other aspects of the man : // He was a New Hampshire man , 6 foot 2 , a crack shot &amp; a famous fly-fisherman &amp; a first rate sailor ... &amp; a woodsman who could find his way through forests primeval without a compass &amp; a canoeist who 'd stillpaddle you up to a deer without ruffling the surface of the pond &amp; an ornithologist &amp; taxidermist &amp; ( when he gave up hunting ) an expert photographer ( the best I 've ever seen ) &amp; an actor who portrayed Julius Caesar in Sanders Theatre &amp; a painter ( both in oils and watercolours ) &amp; a better carpenter than any professional &amp; an architect who designed his own houses before building them &amp; ( when he liked ) a plumber who just for the fun of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well suited to become the wife of such an important man . Descended on her mother 's side from a long line of distinguished forebears , she was quite at home in the cultural and social milieu of upperclass Cambridge . Among her more illustrious ancestors she could count her great-great-great aunt , the English-born Susanna Haswell Rowson , author of one of the first American novels , Charlotte Temple , published in 1794 . Anthony Haswell , a cousin of Susanna , was a political balladeer during the Revolutionary War and the editor and printer of Haswell 's Massachusetts Spy or American Oracle of Liberty . Her great-grandfather , Reverend Pitt Clarke , was an early leader of the Unitarian Church , and pastor in Norton , Massachusetts . His son , John Jones Clarke , was not only a major political figure , but also a noted lawyer . // The impressive lineage , however , ended with her grandfather . Her own father , John A. Hanson , forged his father-in-law 's name to a check , and J. J. Clarke , so aggrieved by what he perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jail but also " obliterated his name from the family archives . " Disgraced by the incident , Rebecca 's mother , Mary Clarke Hanson , sought and received an annulment to the fifteen-year marriage ; reclaimed her maiden name for herself and her children , George and Rebecca ; and moved back to her parents ' house . The effect of this family disaster on fourteen-year-old Rebecca is hard to gauge as she was fairly reticent about the matter . She did later confide to her son that " during her childhood she supposed that her father had been hanged . " ( He had not , but after his release from jail , he disappeared . ) Also , according to her son , " she grew up a shy-or ( as we now say ) neurotic-girl ; who had to be plucked from under sofas whenever friends came to call . " // She also wrote poetry , read widely , and though she did not attend college , was a well-educated young woman , fluent in French and knowledgeable about classical languages and literature . Unitarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her son 's words , " it was an integral part of herself , she expressed it as she breathed and as she smiled . " He also reflected that " never have I encountered anyone more joyous , anyone healthier in body and mind , anyone so quite incapable of remembering a wrong , or anyone so completely and humanly and unaffectedly generous . " // According to Cummings , he could not have been born into a better family : " I was welcomed as no son of any king or queen was ever welcomed . Here was my joyous fate and my supreme fortune . " The record bears this out . His mother 's journal charts with enormous affection and pride baby Estlin 's development on an almost daily basis . Among the more interesting aspects of these entries , in which nearly every movement , gesture , or incident seemed worthy of chronicling , is the involvement of Edward Cummings , who , unlike many fathers of that era , was an obvious and important presence in his son 's life . Or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my earliest remembered life ; when he cradled me in his arms , i reposed in the bosom of God Himself ; &amp; when i rode on God 's shoulder i was king of the world . His illimitable love was the axis of my being . " // Rebecca Cummings 's diary detailed every event , large and small , in her son 's first months of life . Among the entries are notations such as " Boy shed his first real tear ; " " Boy 's first real smile-Boy circumcised by Dr. Hildreth-Bore it very well-Cried lustily till Edward spoke to him telling him to bear it bravely . Then the boy actually stopped crying ; " and " Shows great tenacity in holding things and puts things in his mouth with no hesitation and with excellent aim-watches moving objects in the street from his window . " By early 1895 , she described with great pleasure that " the boy " " Articulates ' ah ' very clearly and in a deep voice , " and " Converses at length : " By April she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehemently in his own language . " And there is , of course , physical description . On June 17 , 1895 , she made this entry : " 14 1/4 lbs .... hair long and silky , a light yellow color-His eyes are still the most beautiful dark blue they were when he was born-and he has a dimple in his right cheek . " The journal continues throughout Estlin 's infancy . Duly recorded are daily rides on his father 's shoulders , his delight in smelling the roses in his father 's garden , the date at which he was fully weaned ( April 17 , 1895 ) , his love of animals , his first word ( " hurrah , " uttered in response to his father 's singing him " Marching through Georgia " ) , and his first steps at fifteen months . Estlin 's acquisition of language was a matter of great interest to his parents for his mother devoted a number of entries to this topic . Not long after his first birthday , for instance , she noted that her son " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself perfectly understood . " By his second birthday Estlin " sings ' Yankee Doodle , ' ' Lohengrin Wedding March , ' ' Daisy bell , ' ' Marching through Georgia , ' ' Only One Girl , ' ' John Brown 's Body ' but makes up words , keeps tune . " On February 16 , 1897 , Rebecca Cummings wrote , " for more than two months Estlin has known all his letters . " // In the eyes of his parents , Estlin was clearly destined for great things . Such a notion was not kept from their son , either . As a baby , Estlin sported a white sweater on which his mother had embroidered a crimson " H " for Harvard . His father frequently took him for strolls across the Harvard campus . An entry for October 14 , 1897 ( Estlin 's third birthday ) reads : " He is very fond of John Harvard the statue then in front of Memorial Hall and says ' when I get a ' ittle bigger Mullah , I 'm going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " The " decidedly lefthanded " Estlin was also encouraged to develop his motor skills , as an entry for April 14 , 1896 testifies : " Father lets him saw wood in mitre saw . " // His artistic talents were in evidence at an early age . Rebecca preserved scores of drawings , which she dutifully dated , from his early childhood on . Most are of animals-dogs , cats , elephants , and giraffes seem to have been his favorite subjects-that for a child of three or four are rendered rather remarkably . Each figure is recognizable as what it is intended to be , and there is already a hint of perspective . The putting together of words into " poetic " form came early , too . When Estlin was three and a half , Rebecca , acting as scribe , recorded " Estlin 's Original Poems : " // Oh , my little birdie oh , with his little toe , toe , toe ! Next comes : There was a little Fader and he made his Moder harder . // And , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book his parents gave Estlin two months before his first birthday , and followed rapidly by volumes ranging from poetry to children 's stories to classics and adventure tales . As Cummings later recalled , " I read or was read , at an early age , the most immemorial myths , the wildest animal stories , lots of Scott and quantities of Dickens ( including the immortal Pickwick Papers ) , Robinson Crusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson , Gulliver 's Travels , Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , poetry galore , The Holy Bible , and The Arabian Nights . " // By the time Estlin was four he was reading , and writing his name on his sketches . When he was five his mother gave him a diary , instructing him on how to keep it . Initially , Estlin dictated the entries to her . //
