<p> In an era when cable cars were first climbing the streets of San Francisco and railroad barons were building mansions on Nob Hill , Gustav Niebaum established a landmark of a different sort . <p> In 1879 , the Finnish sea captain founded the Inglenook estate in Napa County , and it grew to become a huge name in California wine . <p> Today , though , the huge name at the Inglenook estate is one associated more often with film than with wine : Francis Ford Coppola . <p> The Oscar-winning director purchased a part of the property in 1975 , and the rest in 1995 , establishing the Niebaum-Coppola winery . Visitors come from around the world to taste the wine , but an afternoon on the estate offers a lot more than just a lesson in viticulture . With museumlike exhibits and guided tours of the estate , a visit is fascinating , even before the first sip of wine . <p> " Originally I was looking for a summer house in the Napa Valley with a few acres of grapes , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the mid-1970s , he and his wife , Eleanor , were looking for a peaceful place to settle down with their children , and the Inglenook estate was up for grabs . <p> Inglenook had been taken over by a large conglomerate more interested in making cheap jug wine with grapes from the Central Valley than in continuing its tradition of making fine wines . The brand name had been tarnished , the property divided and the chateau was in disrepair . <p> The Coppolas used profits from the first two " Godfather " movies to buy a house on the Inglenook property and about 100 acres of vines . <p> " We seemed to have desirable grapes that people wanted , so I thought we 'd make a little wine of our own , " Coppola said . For a few years he ran a home operation , making wine for friends and family . <p> Then the taste caught on , and in 1978 Coppola launched the winery as a business . When the rest of the Inglenook property went up for sale in 1995 , Coppola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niebaum 's original estate while expanding his own business . <p> From top to bottom , the estate is drenched in historical luxury . Before entering the 1880 chateau  --  built with stone quarried from the hillside by Chinese laborers  --  visitors pass through a courtyard with fountains , pools and park benches modeled after Paris ' Luxembourg Gardens . <p> Then , they walk into the grandiose foyer of the main building , where the exhibits begin . Among them is a display of the precursors to the movie camera . Those 19th century mechanisms include the stereoscope , zoetrope , and praxinoscope . All are devoted to creating the impression of a moving image , and both the images and the machines are on display . <p> The zoetrope works on a concept similar to a flip book ; drawings that vary only slightly are laid out next to each other in a cylinder that spins . As it moves , the viewer gazes through thin slots to the drawings on the inside of the cylinder . Viewed at the proper angle , it appears as if the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in motion . Unfortunately , the zoetropes are stored in glass cases , so visitors ca n't actually see them in motion . But the gadgets themselves are interesting relics and the panels of hand-drawn cartoons are delightful . <p> Also on display is a history of the Coppola family , including a detailed family tree and family photos  --  such as the one of Nicolas Cage ( Coppola 's nephew ) receiving an Oscar for his performance in " Leaving Las Vegas . " Also exhibited are pages from Coppola 's boyhood notebooks , and other ephemera from his youth . <p> The rest of the first-floor foyer is devoted to the history of the Inglenook estate and the Niebaum wines under that name . Exhibited here are the prize medals that Inglenook wines won in the Paris Exposition of 1889 , along with estate guest logs from the 1930s . In the middle of the page in faded ink , one can make out " Jean Harlow and Clark Gable of Hollywood , California . " <p> Do n't miss the restored original tasting room of the 19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing the intricately carved hardwood staircase , visitors enter a museum of movie memorabilia . The second floor is filled with Coppola 's Oscars and film awards as well as props from his films . Don Corleone 's desk from the " Godfather " movies , a surfboard from " Apocalypse Now , " the car from " Tucker : A Man and His Dream , " and elaborate costumes from " Bram Stoker 's Dracula " are on display . The watercolor storyboards from " Apocalypse Now " are interesting pieces of the behind-the-scenes art that goes into movie making . <p> All of this sightseeing is available for free . For those who opt for the $20 historical tour , the original bottling room  --  with its massive redwood casks  --  is the next stop . The room is no longer used for bottling , but for entertaining . Passing olive trees on the way out of the bottling room , the guided tour then climbs a small knoll to look out over the vineyards . <p> The informative tour concludes with a tasting of four Niebaum-Coppola wines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , wine tasting is available for $7.50 ( includes four wines ) in the wine bar and boutique . <p> On and off the tour , there are ample opportunities to buy the Niebaum-Coppola wines , olive oils , salad dressings , pastas and tomato sauces that Coppola has added to his empire in recent years . In the same **29;0;TOOLONG style that permeates the Inglenook estate , Coppola appears to be taking the same route as actor Paul Newman with one exception : While the proceeds from Newman 's food products are donated to charity , Coppola 's business is a for-profit enterprise . <p> If there is one drawback to visiting the Niebaum-Coppola winery , it is the commercial push . Not only does the boutique carry the house products , it is almost a shopping mall , selling everything from crystal and ceramics to T-shirts and sweatshirts . Coppola explains his entrepreneurial endeavors by saying that he 's " trying to earn the money that it costs to be an artist . . . I have been using the income I earn on ( my ) businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can make personal films . " <p> While Coppola spends much of his time in his offices in San Francisco 's North Beach , he does make occasional appearances at the winery , where he 's known to settle himself in a sunny corner and sign wine bottles for the guests . <p> The director takes a major role in the development of all of his businesses , and is proud of the wines he 's created . Although some critics might see the moviemaker selling his celebrity appeal , Coppola believes that he has maintained his integrity in the wine market . <p> " We made Rubicon for 20 years before we publicized my role in it , " he said . " Our wine is one of America 's great wines due to the heritage of the land it comes from . " <p> NIEBAUM-COPPOLA WINERY <p> 1991 St. Helena Highway , Rutherford , CA 94573.
