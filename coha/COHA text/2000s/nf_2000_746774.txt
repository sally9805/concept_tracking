In 1678 , Samuel Shaw , a late Renaissance schoolmaster , published a play called Words Made Visible : or Rhetorick Accommodated to the Lives and Manners of Men . Written earlier for performance by his scholars at Ashby-de-la-Zouch grammar school , this allegorical play brings the figures and tropes on stage to explain and illustrate their functions . Turning the schoolboys ' " toil " in rhetoric into a " pastime , " it provides humorous instruction in the arts Of style and delivery . Although its purpose is pedagogical , not literary , this relatively unknown Renaissance text deserves scholarly attention . Presenting a view of the tropes and figures that stands in stark contradistinction to generally accepted assessments of Renaissance understandings of style , Shaw 's play can also serve as theoretical explication of Shakespeare 's practice eighty years earlier in Titus Andronicus . Such remarkable congruency between Shaw 's theory and Shakespeare 's practice provides persuasive evidence that scholarly conclusions regarding both Renaissance instruction in elocutio and Shakespeare 's rhetorical sophistication in this early play need revision . <p> Shaw 's drama presents Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delivery ) in debate over who has succeeded best at " propagating " their father Rhetoric 's " Dominions " ( 101-02 ) . With Affection a silent onlooker , Ellogus orders Invention to call forth the Tropes and Figures , who argue for their ubiquity , but the debate ends when Eclogus , in spite of Voice and Gesture 's obvious servitude to the figures , declares his equal power : " But before we part I do here declare that Prince Elocution with all his Tropes and Figures signifies nothing without Pronunciation " ( 187 ) . This avowed inseparability between figure and behavior , both of which are connected to thought ( invention ) and emotion ( affections ) , is also announced at the beginning of the play when Prologus states that " men live Tropes and Figures as well as speak them : and this is the thing that is principally design 'd to be represented to you " ( 99 ) . Trope repeats the point , and explicitly extends the domain of figures to thought , ideology and action , when he boasts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babbling things call 'd words ... but in manners and minds , in practices and principles too " ( 109 ) . <p> Not only does Shaw make explicit that tropes and figures are thought patterns or arguments reflected in speech , action , and ideology , but also that all human activity is figure , language . Despite Eclogus 's accusation that the figures and tropes draw language from a plain and honest style to an artificial and deceptive manner of speaking ( Shaw is familiar with the common charges brought against rhetoric ) , the figures each reply in turn that they are as necessary for virtue as for vice and that they exercise power everywhere . Figure explains that " Tropes and Figures do indifferently serve the designs of Vertue and honesty , as well as their contraries , as we hope to make evident to you before you go hence " ( 109 ) . Trope says to his son Metonimy , " It is plain the World hath but two parts , good men and bad , and I see you have got them both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can shew him a man , that is neither good nor bad nor both , nor neither , he shall confess him to be an Alien to his Dominions " ( 115 ) . Metonimy has introduced himself as " the great Nomenclator of the World , " but excuses himself from an account of all his conquests since " what is most signal , where every thing is signal , it is hard to say " ( 113 ) . Invention mentions that the four sons of Trope ( metaphor , metonymy , synecdoche , irony ) could be called by the " four parts of the World " or " the four quarters of the Heavens " ( 112 ) , the claim signifying their ubiquity . Irony too claims that " dissimulation and deceit are as necessary to the practice of Vertue as to the propagation of Vice . Can any man wisely manage the office of a King , a Captain or a Master of any kind , that does not sometime pretend to a displeasure , which he has not really conceiv 'd , assume a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink at a fault which yet he sees plain enough ? " ( 118 ) . Even Gnome or Plain Speech is a figure , whose " greatest glory lies in making Men to live Gnomically , as all just and righteous men do , who by keeping their words , make good their bargains , paying their Debts , and such like things " ( 138-39 ) . He also gains , however , " the more ingenuous and rational part of the World , " for he " invents nothing , adorns nothing , applies nothing , but nakedly propounds what is solid and useful ; whereby he ... tacitely appeals to the Reasons and Judgments of Men " and persuades those who , in believing adornment an " Artifice , " pride themselves on only believing the " Truth itself " ( 137-38 ) . For Shaw , the important distinction in stylistic analysis , then , is not whether an utterance is figurative , but whether its figures have been ill or well used . <p> Shaw 's primary purpose in this play is not merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but more importantly to correct errors in thought , speech , and behavior in order to improve judgment and morals . He does so by pointing out the vices that result from a misuse of the figures and the virtues that result from their proper use . The misuse of figures ( tropic violence ) results from one of two errors , either a purposeful or unpurposeful violation of the figures ' innate assertions about relationships . The first error , a deliberate turning of figures into mere devices by ignoring their relational arguments , Shaw mentions as he announces that his design is <p> an innocent Satyre to promote Morality , and by a surprizing kind of raillery Tax the grave fopperies and beloved vices of the doting world ; when men have made the most serious things dwindle into meer words ; and Vertue and honesty , ( not to say , Religion and Conscience it self ) are esteem 'd or made use of , but as Terms of Art to deceive the ignorant , and serve the turns of interest , faction , or ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naivete  --  an ignorance of the figure and hence of its status as a device and an argument , the character Trope mentions when he boasts that " we have set up ... Dominions ... in the very constitutions of mens minds , and made their conversations voluntary tributaries thereunto " ( 109 ) . The solution to both errors is instruction in the arguments of the tropes and figures so that readers and speakers will be aware of both the device ( artifice ) and its argument ( nature ) . Such instruction makes possible choice and judgment regarding a figure 's use and prevents uncritical , rote adoption of viewpoints or blindness to the unexamined meanings of one 's own thoughts and behaviors . Consequently , as the tropes and figures appear on stage to explain and model their functions , they make reference to both their proper and improper uses . Because figures make both universal ( transferable ) and particular ( nontransferable ) arguments , the figures first define themselves according to the kinds of idea relationships they always assert , and then illustrate themselves in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains that he asserts causal or adjunctive relations between ideas : " if I please to put the cause for the effect , or the effect for the cause ; the Subject for the Adjunct , or the Adjunct for the Subject ; so they must stand ; and if I please to use the contrary method , they must again stand to that too " ( 114 ) . Because figures in use always exist within an irreducible context , including a speaker addressing an audience on a particular occasion in a given historical moment using signs in order to communicate a message and achieve various purposes , figures necessarily reflect the choice and judgment of users who through speech and action necessarily assert relations between not only ideas , but also themselves and others . Figures make both dialectical and moral arguments . " Metonimy " then characterizes his particular uses in terms of good , evil , or naive motives , the ethos determined by whether the relationships the figure asserts are congruent with the relations inhering in the rhetorical context : <p> It is by a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Creator , where others see nothing but the Creature ; and that Idolatrous , and covetous , and proud men , put the Creature in room of the Creator ; that all Hypocrites present us with the sign instead of the thing signif 'd ; ... and indeed in all ill-order 'd Common-wealths , that true Subjects are respected as Adjuncts , and meet Adjuncts are embrac 'd as the best Subjects . ( 115 ) <p> Synecdoche too follows the same pattern of self-disclosure . Emphasizing his ability to be misused , Synecdoche ironically introduces himself as one " who whensoever I please make a part to pass for the whole , and at another time make the whole to signifie no more than the part " ( 120 ) . The ironic frame signals that the proper use requires the part to represent the whole or the whole to represent the part . In its proper use , both part and whole must be seen in relationship . When so seen , " the religious poor man possesseth the whole World " ( 121 ) . By implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its underlying relationship is ignored , creating egoism and either foolishness or maliciousness : <p> " By me a single Monarch makes himself a multitude , and the Parson as if he had a Parish in his belly , cryes We at every word , By me a whole Kingdome fits in Parliament at once ; and the whole World is in a general Councel . ... By my means ... the covetous Muck-worm loseth the whole for a little part . " ( 120-21 ) <p> In sum , Shaw teaches that tropes and figures structure all thought , speech , and action , and that their uses always and of necessity point to motive and character . <p> How widespread this stylistic insight was in Renaissance England remains yet to be explored ; nevertheless , eighty years earlier Shakespeare 's practice in Titus Andronicus indicates he shared it . In this very violent play wherein much of the violence is a literal dismembering , Shakespeare shows both the " civilized " Romans and the " barbaric " Goths habitually performing mental dismemberments that mirror physical dismemberments . Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly defined in the Renaissance as a substitution of part for whole , species for genus , singular for plural , or material ( form ) for essence , and vice versa. ( n1 ) Its inappropriate use , the cognitive act of taking the part to be the whole , Shakespeare suggests , is by nature an act of severance , violence motivating the physical acts of severance , violence . These misused synecdoches also point to egoism , for making the narrow perspective be reality is an act of imposition against either a recognized or an unrecognized " other . " Shakespeare not only places perverted synecdoches in the speech of these characters , but self-consciously draws attention to the figure in speech , action , ideology , and symbol , making the figure a unifying motif in the play and thereby pointing out that the destructive thought pattern propelling the revenge cycle is at base the inappropriate synecdoche . <p> There is not direct mention of the misused synecdoche 's connection with violence or egoism in the British rhetorical handbooks of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's play . But there are instead both cautions about the figures ' misuses and explicit acknowledgments that a speaker 's uses of these devices reflect his or her purposes and judgment . Henry Peacham , for example , warns in The Garden of Eloquence that the synecdoche " ought not to be used in iudiciall pleadings , for there a part may not stand for the whole , nor the whole for a part , without some wrong to the one partie or to the other . " He also warns that " the use of this figure is very unfit among ignorant hearers , which for lacke of knowledge may mistake it , and likewise among cavilling and captious persons , which of wilfull perversenesse may easily pervert the true meaning , either by malice or mockerie " ( fol . C 1 v ) . It is also commonplace in the English Renaissance rhetoric textbooks that one 's speech reveals one 's character . George Puttenham in his rhetoric , The Arte of English Poesie , calls style " the image of man " : <p> And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter and disposition of the writers minde , more than one or few words or sentences can shew , therefore there be that haue called stile , the image of man mentis character for man is but his minde , and as his minde is tempered and qualified , so are his speeches and language at large , and his inward conceits be the metall of his minde , and his manner of vtterance the very warp and woofe of his conceits . ( 160-61 ) I <p> This view of style differs significantly from and calls into question the traditional scholarly account of stylistic theory in the British Renaissance . Typically , scholars have considered Renaissance rhetoric an art of speech , not of reason , of the written word , not of performance or behavior . Whether the rhetoric was Ciceronian , encompassing the five canons of invention , arrangement , style , memory and delivery , or Ramist , with its two divisions of style and delivery  --  the two primary rhetorical systems in the British Renaissance , critics have treated delivery as an " added on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral way with either matter or style . For example , Donald Lemen Clark discounts the role of pronuntiatio in the Renaissance : " It has much less to do with the rhetoric of the Renaissance than with the rhetoric of Greece and Rome , because in Greece and Rome words were spoken to be heard and in Renaissance Europe words were written to be printed and to be read " ( John Milton 12 ) . ( n2 ) Also style , in either system , entailed speech only , which was " clothing for the thought , " with the tropes and figures being " deviations " from plain , ordinary language , but " ornaments " adding pleasure and emotion . Wilbur Samuel Howell , who has written the standard history of British Renaissance rhetoric , Logic and Rhetoric in England , 1500 - 1700 , has helped establish this traditional view. ( n3 ) Eloquence , he explains , " became the study of the forms of speech , wisdom having already guaranteed that the substance of speech was present as raw material " ( 134 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That theory consists in the assumption that good style is a deliberate and systematic repudiation of the speech of everyday life . In other words , good style results from word orders that stand opposed to the patterns of common speech " ( 117 ) , from variations that prevent speech 's " accurate correspondence to states of reality " ( 128 ) . Consequently , " when these departures from the ordinary are made , the motive is often ornament rather than necessity " ( 130 ) . <p> Marion Trousdale reiterates these characterizations in Shakespeare and the Rhetoricians , but appreciates , where Howell does not , the pleasure and emotion the figures add to the text : " By definition such figures were syntactic and semantic turnings of language away from the literal and the commonplace toward patterns and forms that were consciously artful , causing the listener both to admire the art or skill of the conveyance and to be moved by delight in the artifice " ( 82 ) . He goes on , <p> A metaphor , a metonymy , an anaphora are essentially transformations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not provide the means by which meaning is discovered or altered . Rather , they provide the means by which the " bare and naked body " is " attired in rich and gorgious apparell " so that it " seemeth to the common vsage of th ' eye much more comely &; bewtifull then the naturall . " What can be said by figures , then , theoretically can be said without figures . They provide in the strictest sense , albeit in small compass , the poetic means of variation . ( 83 ) <p> But even though " ornament is added onto matter , it is not thereby to the Elizabethan mind synonymous with the frivolous or the useless " ( 88 ) ; rather figures " express a state of mind , " the " feeling of the speaker in relation to some particular event " ( 90 ) . Brian Vickers , a foremost scholar of Renaissance elocutio , even more explicitly than Trousdale emphasizes that figures create a specialized language that represents in the speaker and creates in the audience emotional states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " an attempt to classify emotional states and the resulting speech forms , both being regarded as deviations from normal behaviour , signalling a loss of balance " ( Defence 296-97 ) and that these speech forms have the " power to control will and feelings " ( " Practicalities " 138 ) . <p> Yet some overlaps between figures and the dialectical topics of invention have been noted in the studies of such Renaissance scholars as William G. Crane , Rosemund Tuve , and Sister Miriam Joseph . Crane comments in Wit and Rhetoric in the Renaissance , " It is confusing to discover in an epitome of tropes and figures much the same material as in a treatise which purports to deal with logic " ( 5-6 ) ; in Elizabethan and Metaphysical Imagery , Tuve points out the logical basis of images in metaphysical poetry ( 260,278,334 ) ; and in Shakespeare 's Use of the Arts of Language , Joseph demonstrates in great detail that handbooks , whether Ciceronian , stylistic or Ramistic , logic or rhetoric , impart the same general theory of composition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all discourse . She concludes , <p> First , that the general theory of composition and of reading current in Shakespeare 's England is to be found in one form in the contemporary works on logic and rhetoric combined ; second , that it is to be found in another form in the work of the figurists which , surprisingly , treats of approximately the same matter as do the logic and rhetoric texts combined ; third , that these two forms , although outwardly different , are fundamentally alike . ... All of them take account of the three modes of persuasion , logos , pathos , and ethos ; all build on the topics of invention and recognize the same forms of reasoning and disputation . Logic was clearly regarded as the most important factor in composition . ( 4,398 ) <p> As James J. Murphy has recently pointed out , however , the implications of this overlap between style and argument have not yet been sufficiently explored . Indeed , Murphy calls for a re-examination of the relationships between figures and topics ( 239-53 ) . Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between figures and oral performance , a lacuna I have demonstrated elsewhere ( " Rhetoric as Character-Fashioning " ) . Nor has Shaw 's play been taken into account , except by Vickers , who reads it as a warning against using figures to persuade toward evil ends , rather than as a warning that figures simply are well or ill-used and point fundamentally to motive , judgment , and character . Vickers misses the standard of decorum Shaw teaches because Vickers does not see that Shaw assumes artifice is inherent in all human discourse , not just " artificial " and persuasive , as opposed to " natural " and non-persuasive discourse , that this artifice consists of epistemic structures , which are present either intentionally or unintentionally , and that these structures are figures , which make arguments about dialectical and moral relationships , are either appropriate or inappropriate to the context , and motivate thought , speech and action ( " Some Reflections " 81-102 ) . Shaw assumes that the greater the conscious control one has over one 's figures , choosing appropriately , the greater one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms synonymous . These indications that some Renaissance rhetoricians may have understood close connections between matter , style and delivery more so than scholars have typically thought invite further research on the question of how style and rhetoric were viewed in the Renaissance . II <p> Just as Shaw 's rhetorical instruction and , as we shall see , Shakespeare 's rhetorical practice in Titus Andronicus invite a re-examination of Renaissance notions of style , so reading Shakespeare 's play for his assumptions about style , rather than for the assumptions of critics , invites a re-assessment of critical interpretations of Titus Andronicus . Seeing the synecdoche as a purposive unifying motif in this play makes possible a new explanation for one of the longstanding critical issues in Titus Andronicus  --  the well-noted discrepancy between the highly ornate language and the play 's grotesque , violent action . Until Eugene M. Waith 's attempt in 1955 to resuscitate the play 's reputation , scholars viewing figures as ornaments only had found this discrepancy a sign of Shakespeare 's youthful stylistic exuberance , but immature artistic judgment . Muriel C. Bradbrook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 99 ) . Wolfgang Clemen complains that " the images ' run wild , ' they are not yet organically related to the framework of the play , just as all the other means of expression are but little disciplined in Titus " ( 22 ) . Though agreeing that figures are merely decorative , Waith , however , suggests that the style accomplishes an artistic purpose : through this decorative , refined style , Shakespeare , like his model Ovid , makes his hero " an object of admiration , " pointing up the strangeness of " the man so worked upon that by sheer intensity of passion he ultimately transcends the normal limits of humanity " ( " Metamorphosis " 111-12 ) . <p> Some respondents to Waith have provided alternative artistic justifications for the discrepancy between the ornamented style and the violent action . D. J. Palmer and Grace Starry West argue that the discrepancies belong not to Shakespeare 's style , but to the style of the dramatic personae . Palmer argues that the detached , ornamental style is appropriate for characters ' articulations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite : the decorated style shows " people who are unable to fit their thought to their speech and actions in any appropriate way " ( 73 ) . Considering rhetoric speech only , Lawrence N. Danson suggests that " the paradoxical ineffectuality of the play 's rhetoric "  --  the stately set speeches unintegrated into the dramatic action  --  represents the problem both characters and playwright must face : how to break out of rhetoric and achieve the proper tragic action . That action is death after madness ( 42 ) . S. Clarke Hulse makes a similar argument , but suggests that actions ground meaning : " Titus learns a new language of action that supplants the old Roman oratory , because it alone can simultaneously probe the inner wounds of the spirit , and inflict outer wounds on his enemies " ( 108 ) . Jane Carducci goes further , proposing that neither speech nor gesture is adequate , reflecting " the failure of the Roman masculine ideal to provide adequate expression for internal states " ( 8 ) . Jane Hiles , by contrast , argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " characters mistake the rhetorical context in which they are speaking " ( 62 ) . <p> Other respondents to Waith have found congruencies between the play 's figurative language and violent action . Albert H. Tricomi , for example , points out that Shakespeare literalizes the play 's metaphors ( one being the synecdoche , evidenced in the sixty references to the word " hands " and eighteen more to " head " ) in order to overgo his source , Ovid , by heightening the horror ( 17,19 ) . Whereas Tricomi attributes this technique to Shakespeare 's artistry , other critics , however , have found in the play evidence for their own views about language . Taking a deconstructive approach , Gillian Murray Kendall suggests that the play 's tendency to literalize metaphors reveals that language is violent , detached from reality , because of the inherent " distance between word and thing , between metaphor and what it represents " ( 299 ) . Mary Laughlin Fawcett claims that because of this literalization , the play " displays " words , and combined with images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " encourages ... speculations about the nature of language . ... It ought to be used , more often than it is , as a primary text to evolve a theoretical account of the relationship between the body , signs , speech , and writing " ( 262-63 ) . With her feminist lens , she recognizes body parts in the play serving as symbols of language and finds the depiction of language and interpretation herein to include , along with speech and action , the body as text . She , however , believes that such a reading will define neither Shakespeare 's nor Renaissance ideas about language . Katherine Rowe views the symbol of the dismembered hand within the context of the Renaissance emblem tradition and a Freudian interpretation of fetishism in order to suggest that the symbol is " a kind of false physiological synecdoche , ... one that should be understood as part of a fetishizing tradition that makes the capacity for effective action contingent on disability " ( 280 ) , a cultural tradition Shakespeare unquestioningly passes on ( 284 ) . <p> An analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reveals that while there is a discrepancy between the characters ' language and the reality of the play world , there is a congruency between their speech and their action . Such congruency shows , on the one hand , an inappropriateness in their styles , but , on the other , in Shakespeare 's style an appropriateness and rhetorical self-consciousness . Taking the part for the whole , a habit learned from a corrupt tradition , Titus and Aaron not only mistake contexts , but , worse , they fail or refuse to see complete contexts . Yet Shakespeare 's art , appropriately mirroring the representational relationship between part and whole , overgoes Titus ' s , Aaron ' s , and Ovid 's art , not merely to heighten the horror , but also to provide a psychological analysis of violence in order to instruct audiences not only in its evils , but also in its causes and preventions . Inasmuch as Shakespeare 's symbol-making in Titus Andronicus pulls together into the domain of style the linguistic , rational , behavioral and material dimensions of human discourse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , as Kendall and Fawcett suggest , can be used to derive a theory of language . But the rhetorical theory evident herein  --  that style ( which includes thought , speech , action , and material sign ) constitutes character  --  contradicts Kendall 's assertion that all language is inevitably violent , Danson 's that rhetoric excludes action , and Fawcett 's and Rowe 's that the play corroborates a kind of Freudian and cultural determinism unreflective of Shakespeare 's guiding rhetorical assumptions . III <p> Even though several critics have noted synecdoche as a figure of speech in this play ( Tricomi 16 ; Kendall 299 ; and Rowe 280 ) , none has argued that the fundamental thought pattern lying behind Titus 's or Aaron 's construction of reality , as seen in their speech and actions , is perverted synecdoche . Yet Heather Dubrow has argued that Shakespeare has shown the perverted synecdoche to characterize both Tarquin 's and Lucrece 's perspectives in The Rape of Lucrece , a poem written about the same time as and with close affinities to Titus . She says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lucrece , its etymological sibling synecdoche also assumes an important role throughout the poem . ... By now we should not be surprised to discover that the presence of this trope signals Shakespeare 's interest in the visions and viewpoints it may be said to represent . ... Slynecdoche in turn can symbolize what renders those characters ' responses to their world so tragically inadequate . ( 166 ) <p> She recognizes that Shakespeare places the proper use of synecdoche in both the narrator 's description of the painting that depicts the Trojan War and in the painting itself , wherein it is a sign of artistic achievement ( 167 ) : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Through this contrast , Shakespeare draws attention to the figure and invites the reader to recognize as " a sign of moral failure " ( 167 ) that instead of seeing the part as representative , Tarquin and Lucrece take the part for the whole . Shakespeare 's purpose , Dubrow implies , is to teach readers to avoid " miming the errors he is exposing "  --  to see that in order to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values synecdoche expresses in the depiction of Troy " ( 168 ) . <p> Indeed , having the same pedagogical aim and method in Titus , Shakespeare draws attention to contrastive uses of synecdoche . One inappropriate use characterizes Titus 's speech , wherein either reductive or overly-expansive synecdoches appear frequently . In mental acts of reduction , Titus refers to the villain who has raped and removed the tongue and hands of his daughter as " an accursed hand " ( III.i.66 ) . He will exact revenge upon those responsible " even in their throats " ( III.i.274 ) , and when he taunts the guilty Goth brothers , Chiron and Demetrius , before he dismembers them , he reduces them to their " guilty blood " and " shameful heads , " their mouths , their throats , their bones ( V.ii.183 ) . In a mental act of over-extension , Titus tells Tamora , the mother of these Goth brothers , that they are both with her at the feast : " Why , there they are , both baked in this pie ; /Whereof their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely because Titus makes them literal , these synecdoches are revealed to be inappropriate . In acting out the figurative dismemberment , Titus demonstrates that he has never seen these two Goths as human beings . Showing Titus 's actions mirroring his thoughts , Shakespeare suggests that literal dismemberment results from mental dismemberment and reveals murder to be the ultimate expression of mistaken synecdoche  --  of dismemberment , depersonalization , egotism . <p> That mistaken synecdoche and incipient violence characterize Titus 's fundamental perspective on the world , not merely his view of the enemy , becomes apparent because he also customarily views fellow Romans and himself " in parts " without awareness of his thought process . He will restore to Saturninus , the deceased emperor 's eldest son , " Ithe people 's hearts " ( I.i.211 ) . He asks for the people 's " voices " in support of his vote ( I.i.218 ) . He calls his daughter Lavinia " dear heart " ( III.i.210 ) . He thinks of himself as a head and Rome , without an emperor , as headless . To his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head on headless Rome , " Titus responds , " A better head her glorious body fits/Than his that shakes for age and feebleness " ( I.i . 186-88 ) . <p> In these instances , Titus reduces emotions , qualities , and identities to material reality and then dismembers the material into pieces . Synecdochic processes are more fundamental here than metonymic ones , then . That Titus has reduced Lavinia 's chastity to the material and considers it a part of her can be seen from the way he lists her virtue among the body parts she has lost : " Both her sweet hands , her tongue , and that more dear/ Than hands or tongue , her spotless chastity " ( V.ii.175-76 ) . That he has equated his own emotions with physical responses can be seen as he imaginatively divides his body into parts to express his complaints : " my bowels can not hide her woes " ( III.i.230 ) , and " my heart , all mad with misery , /Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh " ( III.ii.9-10 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what become for him all-encompassing symbols . The hand , a symbol of action and thereby of language , becomes a symbol of his identity . The hand " writes " ( III.i.167-69 ) his service , loyalty , and honor  --  his character and identity . Bassianus comments that by means of his hand , Titus " hath express 'd himself in all his deeds/A father and a friend to ... Rome " ( I.i.421-2 ) . Such symbolization also appears in Titus 's lament over Lavinia 's dismemberment ; there , the personification of the hand hints at how easily Titus can reduce himself to his hand : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Titus too reduces people to material symbols in which he then sees his whole world . To Titus , his children represent the family honor , his raison d'etre . Since Titus is family head , the children then represent Titus himself . But it is the bodies , whether alive or dead , that Titus fixes on . He refers to the bodies of his sons who have died honorably in war as " my joys " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cordial of mine age " ( I.i . 166 ) , " my dear " ( punning on " deer " ) ( III.i.91-92 ) , and my " welkin " ( III.225-26 ) , it is her body 's purity that gives her value . With his children reduced to material icons , these figures , though suggesting his love , reflect his dehumanization , and because his children lose their value when they are associated with dishonor , Titus reveals that he never sees them as more than symbols . ( n4 ) <p> Such a perspective motivates and is corroborated by his violence . He says when he kills Mutius for disobedience , " Nor thou , nor he , are any sons of mine , / My sons would never so dishonor me " ( I.i.294-95 ) . He thinks nothing of sacrificing the lives of his fellow Romans in order to wreck revenge upon all of Rome . He slays Lavinia in order to remove the father 's " shame " and daughter 's " sorrow " ( V.iii.46-47 ) . He can even willingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and context , Titus reveals his unawareness of his thought process and his blindness to his own resulting egoism and barbarity . For example , as Kendall has also pointed out ( 300-02 ) , Titus mixes inappropriately the figurative and literal uses of the same word even within sentences . He is logically inconsistent when he places his own literal head on the figurative body of Rome , and insensitive when punning on hand in handless Lavinia 's presence : " What accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy father 's sight ? " ( III.i.67 ) . He also can not match his figures to the reality of the situation he faces . In reducing himself to his hand , he fails to see that he incongruously , but necessarily , separates his hand from himself . The reality of Lavinia 's bleeding , maimed , anguishing body stands in grotesque contrast to his beautiful , but depersonalizing description of her sorrow : " then fresh tears/Stood on her cheeks , as doth the honey-dew/Upon a gath'red lily almost withered " ( III.i.111-13 ) . That his view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the heaven and himself to sea and earth : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> On the one hand , Titus expresses here his compassion for Lavinia ' s suffering . She and he are so inextricably bound together that he feels her pains and sorrows . Being like a goddess to him , she receives his adoration . On the other hand , as a tyrannical divinity , distant and oppressive , she forces him to suffer woes and shame . In either case , however , she is a symbol , and focusing here on her dismembered body , which has become a synecdochic icon of all the injustices that have rained upon him , he feels an animosity toward her implied by the sea 's waxing " mad , /Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoll'n face " ( 11. 222-23 ) . Combined with the synecdoche of himself as the world , which makes his unacknowledged egoism explicit , Titus 's expression of love appears not insincere , but unbelievable . He further undermines this " love " because " trimm 'd " Lavinia , as a symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occurring during Titus 's justification for unbounded retaliation , these comparisons permit him both to spew forth his grief sickness so that others suffer the effects of his woes and to insist that he be allowed to do so : " Then give me leave , for losers will have leave/To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues " ( 11. 232-33 ) . The argument , the insistence , the impersonalization  --  all point to both egoism and violence ; the synecdoches reveal the thought pattern motivating the behaviors ; the contradictions point to Titus 's lack of self-understanding . Without self-awareness , Titus is trapped within a thought process that is self-perpetuating , that both reflects and determines what he sees . <p> This tendency to take the part for the whole , to dehumanize , also motivates and characterizes Titus ' s larger reading patterns . Titus favors " rites " over " rights . " In taking reified social practices as the standard for decorum , Titus objectifies the forms , severs them from contexts , and acts by rule rather than by interpretation . Blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires , he heeds only the universal , not the contingent , dimension of reality . Defining the universal at too specific a level , however , he thereby turns contingencies into universal algorithms . For instance , Titus supposes Tamora , the conquered queen of the Goths , can not object to the martyring of her son , Alarbus , because as a religious sacrifice he dies honorably . Such words should be enough to comfort her : " Patient yourself , madam , and pardon me. /These are their brethren , whom your Goths beheld/Alive and dead , and for their brethren slain/Religiously they ask a sacrifice : /To this your son is mark 'd , and die he must , /T'appease their groaning shadows that are gone " ( I.i.121-26 ) . In giving his daughter to the newly-crowned Saturninus , Titus ignores not only her preferences in marriage and the legal right Bassianus , her betrothed , has to her , but also any justification Titus 's own sons have in defending that right . <p> By reducing moral behaviors to formalized rites , one reduces identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine expressions of emotion or individuality . The first entrance of Titus , the war hero 's triumphal return , shows this posturing . It is replete with epic simile , classical allusions , direct address to oneself , and a formal pageantry that Robert S. Miola claims " threatens to turn the entire scene into melodrama " ( 197 ) . Such posturing is also evidenced when Titus pleads before Saturninus and the tribunes for his wrongly-accused sons , laments his sorrows , comforts Lavinia , vows revenge , and exacts punishment upon his enemies through public spectacle . In these stylized actions and formulaic speeches , Titus bears out Aaron 's observation that these Romans express " conscience , /With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies , /Which I have seen thee careful to observe " ( V.i.75-77 ) . ( n5 ) <p> Just as Titus reads " rites , " so he reads precedents . Because he divorces stories from authors , his precedents , whether historical or mythical , become to him facts , not interpretations of reality . Tereus and Philomela are for him as real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Virginius . Art ( tradition ) is reality , and life becomes an imitation of art . By showing how the preexisting patterns of stories dictate what Titus sees , Shakespeare emphasizes this reversal , of art being reality and life imitation . Titus discovers what has happened to Lavinia by reading Ovid 's Philomela myth and then concludes that nature imitates art : " Ay , such a place there is where we did hunt/ ( O had we never , never hunted there ! ) / Pattern 'd by that the poet here describes , /By nature made for murthers and for rapes " ( IV.i.55-58 ) . Furthermore , Titus sees the characters of myths as symbols , but then the symbols as reality . Titus knows himself as Piety because he models his acts upon those of the " Pious . " He compares himself to Priam : " Romans , of five and twenty valiant sons , /Half of the number that King Priam had , /Behold the poor remains , alive and dead ! " ( I.i.79-81 ) . He reenacts Aeneas 's conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n6 ) showing he compares himself to Aeneas , who was surnamed " Pious . " He identifies Lavinia in the part of Philomela and Lucrece , or " Chastity Defiled , " and Chiron and Demetrius as Tereus and Tarquin , or " Rape . " <p> Certain of his own piety because he religiously observes Roman ceremonies and traditions , Titus reveals his blindness to the barbarity  --  the perverted synecdochic structure  --  of the Roman honor code he embodies . Civilization means ensuring the peaceful cohabitation of individuals within a cooperative community through dialogue , shared meaning , mutually beneficial agreements . In the ritualistic Roman world of this play , however , the rites and precedents that supposedly enshrine these values , because prohibiting some acts of violence while inconsistently sanctioning others , instead promote monologue and produce victimizers and victims , dehumanizing roles each Roman alternately plays . These contradictions at the center of the Roman honor code , Tamora sums up aptly as " O irreligious piety " ( I.i . 130 ) . Of them , Miola has similarly noted : " Roman heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet they also force Romans to lead lives that are increasingly at odds with human instincts and needs " ( 196 ) and point to " fundamental weaknesses in Rome and basic paradoxes in its values " ( 200 ) . <p> Indeed , if Titus has been a victimizer , he also becomes a victim . First , in judging honor by external markers only , Titus can not read character accurately and so opens himself up to violation . He becomes subject to a tyrant because in showing loyalty to the tradition of primogeniture , he believes Saturninus , the eldest son of Ceasar , is most fit to rule : " his virtues will ... /Reflect on Rome as Titan 's rays on earth , /And ripen justice in this commonweal " ( I.i.225-27 ) . Titus becomes the victim of Tamora 's vengeance , because in believing that once conquered and subjected to Roman rule the enemies of Rome become civilized , he supposes he can treat Tamora with courtesy and weave permanent peace : " Now , madam , are you prisoner to an emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , /Will use you nobly and your followers " ( I.i.258-60 ) . Because Romans show gratitude to those who do one service ( I.i.448 ) , Titus expects to receive honor from the newly married and elevated Saturninus and Tamora , who are " beholding to the man/That brought them for this high good turn so far " ( I.i.396-97 ) . <p> Second , since Roman rites ignore rights , Titus has accepted as proper a kind of masochism , a willingness to inflict self-violence in order to " belong . " This willingness appears in Titus 's effort to comfort Lavinia by offering figuratively to take her wounds upon himself : " Or shall we cut away our hands like thine ? /Or shall we bite our tongues , and in dumb shows/Pass the remainder of our hateful days ? " ( III.i. 130-31 ) . Angered by his wrongs , he beats upon himself both literally and figuratively : " This poor right hand of mine , /Is left to tyrannize upon my breast , /Who , when my heart , all mad with misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus I thump it down " ( III.ii.7-11 ) . Such self-victimization , along with the dehumanization it implies , is also seen as Titus willingly , even gratefully , sacrifices his hand at the emperor 's request in order to save his sons ' lives . In his unself-conscious mixing of figurative and literal , he again reveals his naivete : " O gracious Emperor ! O gentle Aaron ! /Did ever raven sing so like a lark/ That gives sweet tidings of the sun 's uprise ? /With all my heart I 'll send the Emperor my hand. /Good Aaron , wilt thou help to chop it off ? " ( III.i. 157-61 ) . Titus turns even this sacrifice , this giving up of his own rights , into a rite in order to show his honorable participation in community . But this rite , ironically , also makes obvious that such participation is itself an act of dismemberment . <p> Third , believing postures to be reality , Titus is blind to his detachment from the emotions he supposes he is showing and to the contradictions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " dishonorable " son , a dishonored daughter , or an enemy for a sacrifice without remorse , but on his victorious return to Rome will shed " tears of true joy " ( I.i.76 ) , " bitter tears " ( III.i.6 ) to plead pardon for his innocent sons , and " wretched tears " ( III.i.207 ) to enact his consuming sorrows . Titus feels neither grief nor compassion , but instead self-pity and anger-emotions that spring from self-division . <p> Fourth , detached from others and himself , Titus can not introspect , but projects images of himself onto the world  --  images that then reflect what he is . Like Narcissus , he sees himself in the fountain that then mirrors back sympathy . He sees himself in the fly Marcus kills : " Out on thee , murderer ! thou kill'st my heart ! " ( III.ii.54 ) . This self-projection , his egoism , both is and produces madness . This retreat into his own world , where all he sees is the story of his woes , mirrors what Titus has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mad Titus , obsessed with his suffering and his revenge , " says S. Clarke Hulse , " looks at every object around him for the reflection of his personal state " ( 113 ) , in order that even as Titus ' s house becomes " the spatial extension of himself , " so his study ( the room ) becomes " the object of his contemplation  --  his grief and revenge " ( 116 ) . IV <p> At the mid-point of the play , Shakespeare draws attention to synecdoche through the pivotal hand-chopping scene wherein Titus 's unself-conscious misuse of the figure contrasts sharply with Aaron 's conscious misuse . Whereas Titus turns dismembered limbs and bodies into symbols he then reads as reality , Aaron turns real dismemberment into mere symbol . As the hand , so the act of giving one 's hand symbolizes service , brotherhood , mutual agreement , the giving of oneself , emphasized in the preceding act as Quintus had given his hand to help his brother Martius out of the pit . Titus expresses the sentiment : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underscores Titus 's propensity to see the hand and the act , not as symbols , but as himself . Pointing to Titus 's characteristic self-detachment , the hand becomes a whole with a life of its own . When Titus offers his hand , mixing unself-consciously the figurative and literal in the expression , " Lend me thy hand , and I will give thee mine " ( III.i.187 ) , he agrees to the violation because he is blinded by his own language . <p> When Aaron , speaking supposedly for the emperor , asks for the sacrifice of a hand ( a part ) in exchange for Titus 's two sons ( two wholes ) , he not only presents Titus with a material parody of synecdoche , but also makes obvious Titus 's customary habit of thought . Because the hand is not a literal part of this whole ( the sons ) , Aaron emphasizes the figurative dimension of this relationship in spite of its materiality . In further emphasis , Aaron follows up this synecdoche with another . Saying to Titus , " Look by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he then says to himself , " Their heads , I mean " ( III.i.201-02 ) . By explicating the second synecdoche through his aside , Aaron reveals his use of this figure to be an intentional mockery of Titus 's unself-awareness and resulting gullibility . By literalizing the act of giving a hand , Aaron perverts the act 's meaning , for service is impaired , loyalty scorned , mutual agreement violated , communication severed , and the individual dismembered . Aware of the violence and violation , with no intention of returning Titus 's sons , Aaron delights in the perversion and in his own superior wit . Aaron , then , recognizes the figure , but ignores its universal arguments . <p> When the two heads and hand are returned to Titus , both Aaron 's and Titus 's synecdoches are revealed as figures . Titus 's hand is only a hand ; the heads are only heads . As Tricomi notes , " Aaron does engineer the return of Titus 's sons in that he returns the part for the whole . Like a literary artist Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons he has returned a metaphor ! " ( 16 ) . These body parts  --  hand and heads  --  make obvious not only that parts have been standing for wholes , but also that the parts are not wholes and that without the wholes they are useless , lifeless . <p> It is at this moment that Titus , the naive literalist , recognizes for the first time a discrepancy between word , act , and meaning . Titus becomes aware that his utterances are figures whose contingent meanings , because dependent upon multiple congruencies , not a monadic , absolute correspondence , can be twisted , ignored , blown away as " Sibyl 's leaves " by " the angry northern wind " ( IV.i. 10406 ) . When applied to his daughter who has no hands , the synecdoche " to lay violent hands upon her life " ( III.ii.25 ) becomes absurd and figurative . Nor are the contingent meanings of his acts absolute ; they too can be misread or disregarded . As Kendall also argaes , Titus comes to realize a separation between word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ' ) is no longer linked directly to ' tongue ' or ' hand ' but to a range of words and gestures . Titus attempts not to impose readymade tropes on the world around him ... rather he will ' wrest ' a language out of the world " ( 304 ) . But rather than see that words and actions , because figures , automatically point to universal mental processes , to ways of viewing reality , Titus believes instead that words and postures must be consciously literalized in the material in order to have unmistakable meanings . Although now aware of the gap between thought , word , and act , Titus can not escape completely from trying to make contingencies be universals because he still considers the material outside the realm of figure . Copying Aaron 's literalization , Titus now creates a public processional : with his sons ' severed heads , his severed hand and his daughter 's mangled body , he parades " real " evidence of his miseries in order to justify his revenge . Whereas he had earlier complained that Saturninus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I.i.313 ) , he now sends Chiron and Demetrius weapons wrapped in the quotation from Horace to ensure they understand that the words are weapons ( IV.ii.26-28 ) . He makes permanent and real his lesson in revenge by literally writing in brass and blood , sending the knife with his oration to the emperor , and dismembering Chiron and Demetrius . Ironically , he never sees these acts as symbolizations he has created through synecdoche . <p> Robbed of his hand , Titus finds himself denied certain postures . At first , he believes he has been denied self-expression , since he has conceived of language only in terms of the body parts that produce it . Frustrated by this loss , Titus angrily chides his brother : " Marcus , unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot ; /Thy niece and I , poor creatures , want our hands/And can not passionate our tenfold grief/With folded arms " ( III.ii.4-7 ) . But Titus learns that neither Lavinia nor he has been silenced , for gestures need not be prescribed , but can be self-derived . He says to Lavinia : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if actions can be self-derived , they need not be postures . <p> Seeing how Chiron and Demetrius ( following Aaron 's advice ) have overgone Tereus 's silencing of Philomela in their dismembering of Lavinia , Titus also comes to see that precedents can be transformed to suit one 's own purposes . He can now become emulative , freed from blind , rote imitation . That he is self-conscious of this ability we see as Titus chooses to overgo Procne 's revenge : " For worse than Philomel you us 'd my daughter , /And worse than Progne I will be reveng 'd " ( V.ii.194-95 ) . In his transformations , Titus plays the part of both Pandion , the father , and Procne , the sister ; he transposes Chiron and Demetrius from the role of Tereus to that of Itys ; and he serves up two sons instead of one to Tamora , also in the part of Tereus , calling her the " tigress " instead of himself , Procne 's replacement . Like Procne , he kills his own child . But , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing the less-known version of the Virginius story , but one more relevant to his own case . Kendall believes that Titus 's choice of this version " would almost certainly make a Renaissance audience more aware that Titus is engaging in an act of textual choice " ( 313 ) . Also unlike Procne , he kills his Tereuses . <p> Yet , even in his inventiveness , Titus remains fundamentally imitative , because he perpetuates only the violent reading practices in which he has always engaged . He copies Procne 's violent acts of retribution and self-justification because , in failing to recognize the incongruencies between revenge and justice , he fails to read these acts 's characters . Because unaware that utterance , action , and imitation are by nature arguments , he fails to see that Ovid 's version of the myth includes a perspective contrastive to Procne 's own  --  a perspective that in the Renaissance was read as a warning that unbridled passion results in barbarity. ( n7 ) Because Titus reads in pieces , he dismembers the myth through his literal imitation . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies its significance in laughingly encouraging the Goth brothers to overgo its barbarity , his imitation too is an act of dismemberment . V <p> Shakespeare , in contrast to Titus or Aaron , models the appropriate use of synecdoche in several ways . First , in placing the improperly used figure in the language of Titus and Aaron in order to show the motivation for their vengeance and violence , he appropriately connects thought pattern with speech , behavior , and character . <p> Second , his own symbol-making , because not reductive , shows the whole by means of a part . The severed limbs , which serve as symbols of dismemberment , also come to serve as symbols of truncated synecdoche , suggesting synonymity between the barbarous act and the barbarous thought . Because these limbs are material signs , also representing symbol , gesture , speech , and thought , they make explicit the connection between style and these other domains of human discourse . But because these severed limbs represent truncations of language ( postures , literalizations ) , while still mirroring the unity among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is violent , but rather that partial views of language are violent . They suggest that whenever misreading or mis-speaking occurs , a misapplication of synecdoche has also occurred  --  that synecdoche , as one of the fundamental tropes , is always ever-present in language and used either appropriately or inappropriately . Because these limbs represent the individual , the family , the community , and communication , Shakespeare shows in one image the multiple contexts simultaneously mutilated by barbarousness . With this multi-layered overlap , the rape , dismemberment , and execution of Lavinia come to represent the rape , dismemberment , and dissolution of female and male subjectivity , of the Andronici , of Rome , and of human discourse. ( n8 ) Equally well , however , serve the symbols of the hand and severed heads in representing the same themes . But , in making these mutilations symbols , Shakespeare does not forget , nor let the audience forget , how the parts relate to the wholes . Because Lavinia 's literal wounds cause her visible suffering , they attest to a humanness that contrasts with how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for communication , she is not silenced . Her gestures , tears , and " scrowls " still communicate her emotions and intents . She can still reveal her assailants ' identities , and she still reveals her own values as those of her father as she participates in family rituals , assists in seeking revenge by holding the bowl that catches Chiron and Demetrius 's blood , and stands as a willing accomplice in her own " heroic " martyrdom . Her death shows her assent to the self-victimization and violence of the corrupt Roman tradition . <p> Third , because Shakespeare uses signs to point to mental constructs that in turn point to both ideologies and characters , his own acts of imitation , unlike those of Titus and Aaron ( or Demetrius and Chiron ) , are not violent , inappropriately synecdochic . Aware of texts as arguments , he does not dismember his literary precedents by extracting or transforming quotations , images , plots , and roles without regard for their original contexts , characters . Rather , by adopting or correcting their arguments within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philomela myth as a warning against the violence resulting from excessive passion , but sees that the argument can be better made by correcting Ovid 's style . Ovid , who describes his characters in a detached and elegant manner , makes them symbols of passions and transforms them materially into things nonhuman . About this style in the Metamorphoses Waith says : <p> The seemingly illogical combination of emotional excitement and psychic distance contributes to the effect of impersonalization . The metamorphosis of the character is of absorbing interest ; the individual who is transformed is only interesting as an example of metamorphosis . ... In the story of Philomela , the tongue , when it has been cut out , is compared to the severed tail of a snake , still twitching ( VI , 557-60 ) . In every case the visual image is exact and thus the horror more vivid , yet at the same time our minds are turned away from the individual as a whole to a minute contemplation of what has happened to one part of his body . Looking thus through the microscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the overwhelming reality of the wound ... The comparisons are often extended , usually unexpected , sometimes even fanciful , always neatly phrased . What may seem at first an incongruous elegance is perfectly suited to the process of transforming a character into an emotional state . Violence , as Ovid describes it , is an emblem of the transformation . In a sense , it is itself transformed in the process into an object of interested but somewhat detached contemplation . ( " Metamorphosis " 104 ) <p> <p> Actually working against any judgment about these characters ' barbarity , this style shows instead Ovid 's tendency to dehumanize and dismember . Because he turns his characters into interesting objects of contemplation , represented by their transformation into birds , Ovid maintains a detachment from the tragic behaviors and consequences and encourages more materializations of the symbolic . Even if readers take these physical metamorphoses to represent moral changes , as Renaissance allegorizers commonly interpreted them , ( n9 ) the myth can not persuade against violence , dehumanization , as long as it dehumanizes . <p> In Titus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not reduce his characters to types , symbols , body parts , or objects of contemplation . Titus and Aaron , though making similar arguments and sharing similar character traits , are not mirror images of each other , nor merely allegories of Revenge and Deceit . Since Titus and Aaron both develop because of experience , Shakespeare draws attention to how their motives  --  which turn out to be those of this Ovidian style  --  account for the connections among thoughts , actions , and consequences . In this way , Shakespeare maintains engagement with the tragic suffering depicted on stage , but at the same time creates repulsion to it ; thereby he dissuades his audience from rote imitation and teaches them how to correct their own styles ( thoughts , characters ) so as to prevent themselves from becoming trapped by vengefulness . Moreover , Shakespeare reveals his own text as an argument . He does not derive the story of Titus from Roman history , but rather conflates many time periods into a fictional " summary of Roman politics , " as T. J. B. Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedent , his drama can not be read as fact . By bringing Ovid 's Metamorphoses on stage , not only literally in book torm , but also figuratively in the imitations of Titus and the Goth brothers , he also shows literature being used for instructional purposes . This open acknowledgment of his own didacticism and his own debts to source-material further highlights the emulative nature of his imitative practice . By presenting four differing versions of the Philomela myth in an intertextual debate , Shakespeare does not silence alternate perspectives , but through the contrast overgoes them by emphasizing his more mimetic and hence more moral portrayal . Such a contrast , when noticed , also entails the audience in a critical process that prevents synecdochic dismemberment . <p> Unfortunately , until now scholars have failed to notice this intertextual debate and have treated Shakespeare 's imitation in Titus as dismemberment . Barbara A. Mowat claims that " one of the problems with Titus Andronicus is that often the overlapping myths pull against each other . At the play 's end , for instance , both Tamora and Titus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dupe the child-killing tyrant . Further , Titus at this point is also Procne , preparing the banquet for Tereus , a role transferred here confusingly to Tamora while the actual Tereuses are being baked in pasties . Little but confusion and fragmentation can result from such superpositions and role duplications " ( 65 ) . Heather James believes that Shakespeare dismembers literary authorities just as Titus has done , replicating " the tragedy 's patterns of competition , mutilation , and digestion " ( 285 ) . Jonathan Bate characterizes Shakespeare 's literary borrowings as allusion and paradigma , rather than imitatio : since the pieces of various sources seem merely woven together , Shakespeare has not yet fully digested his classical exemplars ( Shakespeare and Ovid 197 ) . <p> These interpretations result , in part , from common misunderstandings about the role of imitatio in the rhetorical tradition  --  a subject that in its own right needs further examination . Shakespeare 's portrayal of improper and proper imitation does put him squarely in the tradition of the humanist educational reformers , who were influenced by Quintilian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as a mere copying of textual fragments or conventions , but as agreement or disagreement with literary precedents . These educators attribute all learning to a happy mix of nature , art , and practice ( application ) , the last called " imitation . " Imitation entails seeing how masters have used the art and then following their examples . Rote imitation is foolish , however ; emulation , the striving to surpass , is what produces the good and wise discourse . For example , in Ciceronianus through Bulephorus , his mouthpiece , Erasmus speaks favorably of emulation : " But why is it necessary to imitate exactly and always , when often it is better to rival and sometimes easier to surpass ? " ( 44 ) . Johannes Sturm declares that no imitation " is worthie prayse , which doth not bestowe in the place of that which wee imitate , a thing eyther as good or better : or if it seeme baser , yet it may appeare to be done not without some purpose and reason " ( A Ritch Storehouse G7r-v ; qtd. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as had Quintilian , counsels the pupil " to striue and contend " with " the best latin authors " ( 246 ) . <p> In order to emulate , the student can not merely see " texts as collections of segments " to be memorized and recirculated , as Eugene R. Kintgen and many others believe the Renaissance practice of imitation encourages ( 25,40 ) ; ( n10 ) rather , the pupil must view a text as an author 's purposed argument and must both identify strategies and evaluate their effectiveness within the context of not only the whole text , but also the text 's kairos ( the discursive situation ) . Only in this way can the new author appropriately transfer the model 's subject , form , style , sentences , strategies , or principles of judgment to the new occasion . Juan Luis Vives explains , <p> the zealous imitator will study , with the greatest attention , the model he has set up for himself , and will consider by what art , by what method , such and such was achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar artifice may accomplish his own intention in his own work . ( 195 ) <p> Since every new text has a new kairos , rote imitation will always be inappropriate . Erasmus ( Bulephorus ) suggests that to speak well , one must make one 's speech <p> consistent with the persons and conditions of present day life . ... What effrontery then would he have who should insist that we speak , on all occasions , as Cicero did ? ... Then , since on every hand the entire scene of things is changed , who can today speak fittingly unless he is unlike Cicero ? ( 61-62 ) <p> It is when one does not consider authorial intentions and judgment that one imitates blindly and inappropriately . Thus , Angel Day reminds his would-be scriveners : <p> Nothing is more disordered , fonde , or vaine , then for anye one , of a thinge well done , to take forth a president , and thinke to make vnto him selfe thereof a common platforme for euery other accident , who without consideration of the grauity or lightnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vnto a foolish Shoemaker , that making his shoes after one fashion , quantitye and proportion : supposeth the same forthwith of abilitie fitte to serue euery mans foot ) includeth in like sort a common methode vnto euery matter . Such imitators who rather by rote than reason make hauocke of wit with purchase of small discretion , by such unnecessary capitulations , beeing often times farre different from their owne intended purposes , are better prepared to deliuer unto viewe the ridiculous pike of Horace with an Asses heade monstrouslye shaped , whereat the Readers may laugh , ... then certainely to manifest their argument with such correspondent speaches as thereunto may be deemed incident . ( 4-5 ) <p> Yet , Erasmus reminds his readers that in speaking appropriately , one is most like Cicero , since Cicero strove to speak fittingly on every varied occasion ( 61 ) . Proper imitation , then , requires that one imitate primarily the exemplar 's judgment ( the true art ) , not necessarily the text 's superficial , contingent , and changeable features . But emulation encourages the imitator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exemplar 's judgment and decorousness . <p> Because of the imitator 's new contexts , imitation necessarily involves the transformation of models ; such transformation characterizes the various schoolboy exercises of double translation , paraphrase , metaphrasis ( turning prose to verse and vice versa ) , epitome ( reducing texts to aphorisms ) and imitatio proper . Furthermore , imitation often requires the schoolboy to evaluate poor models in order to learn what to eschew in his own writing and speaking . It also encourages noticing how the model authors imitated not only the rules of the art , but also their own models . Erasmus ( Bulephorus ) advises , " What conclusion then , except that we may learn from Cicero himself how to imitate Cicero ? Let us imitate him as he imitated others " ( 81 ) . Applying Erasmus 's counsel , Ascham suggests the following as the proper reading method to prepare for composition : <p> Erasmus , the ornament of learning , in our tyme , doth wish that som man of learning and diligence , would take the like paines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Virgill , that is , to write out and ioyne together , where the one doth imitate the other ... after this sort . Tullie reteyneth thus moch of the matter , thies sentences , thies wordes : This and that he leaueth out , which he doth wittelie to this end and purpose . This he addeth here . This he diminisheth there . This he ordereth thus , with placing that here , not there . This he altereth and changeth , either , in propertie of wordes , in forme of sentence , in substance of the matter , or in one , or other conuenient circumstance of the authors present purpose . <p> In theis fewe rude English wordes , are wrapt vp all the necessarie tooles and instrumentes , wherewith trewe Imitation is rightlie wrought withall in any tonge. ( 267-68 ) <p> Inasmuch as model texts in the Renaissance classroom span the genres of history , philosophy , oratory , and poetry , this practice promotes the recognition of all texts as arguments , the development of the student 's judgment , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a kind of intertextual dialogue or conflict " ( 36 ) . <p> Because of his own imitative practice in Titus , Shakespeare seems not to be dismissing wholesale a classical learning based on imitation , then , as scholars , such as Bate ( Shakespeare and Ovid 108-09 ) and Mihoko Suzuki ( 104 ) have argued , but rather its inappropriate use stemming from mistaken synecdochic perspectives . Such a misuse , Shakespeare suggests , led not only to the fall of Rome , but will lead to the fall of any civilization . West concurs on this point : " Although everyone in the play , whether Roman or Goth , is evidently educated in the best Roman books , the moral excellence which one would expect to be the fruit of such study is missing . On the contrary , Roman education , which seems to stand for Roman tradition in general , has been twisted to become the teacher and rationalizer of heinous deeds " ( 65 ) . Inasmuch as revenge is an act of improper imitation  --  a failure to fully digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestation of a mistaken synecdochic perspective . In this context , Titus 's macabre feast becomes a literalization of this narrow reading process and both a symbol of and argument against this unpalatable banqueting on ever-escalating violence . Finally , Shakespeare 's own act of rhetorical imitation ( argument )  --  correcting his source by better imitating " nature " ( appropriateness )  --  is also an act of literary imitation ( figural or psychological mimesis ) , the identity between the genres suggesting that rhetoric and poetic are essentially alike , both grounded in mimesis , itself a synonym for decorum . Shakespeare 's self-conscious treatment of imitation in Titus enables the play to function , then , as a rhetorical handbook , one that instructs in the arts of reading and speaking  --  in a word , living  --  well . VI <p> Shakespeare gives no indications in this play that its revenge cycle will end . Also followers of this corrupt Roman tradition , Marcus , Titus 's brother , and Lucius , Titus 's last remaining son , exhibit the same language and reading habits as Titus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same figures of speech and symbols as those used at the beginning . Rome , as the body politic , has suffered , like Troy , a " civil wound " ( V.iii.87 ) : her " limbs " have been " broken " ( Il . 72 ) . But these limbs are like stalks of corn that can somehow be gathered again " into one mutual sheaf " ( 11.70-71 ) . They were broken by the barbarous Goths ( 11.96-105 ) , not the pious Andronici ( 11.129 ) . Titus 's was " that true hand that fought Rome 's quarrel out " ( 11. 102 ) , and Lucius himself the true body , who has " preserv 'd Rome 's welfare in his blood , /And from her bosom took the enemy 's point , /Sheathing the steel in his advent'rous body " ( 11. 110-13 ) , where his " scars can witness , dumb although they are , /That his report is just and full of truth " ( 11. 114-15 ) . Lucius also makes it a point to teach his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 11.159-60 ) . But Shakespeare 's own practice as playwright makes the inappropriate thought patterns lying behind this cycle obvious to his audience and models the appropriate patterns . Helping us in a way the Romans and Goths in this play were not helped , Shakespeare shows us the problem , its cause , and solution . <p> As Brian Vickers has suggested , " the challenge facing students of rhetoric is to integrate the appreciation of stylistic detail into a response to the whole " literary work ( " Shakespeare 's Use of Rhetoric " 92 ) . In Titus Andronicus , Shakespeare himself has shown the way to do so by connecting synecdoche in speech to thought patterns also underlying ideology , action , and art . As Vickers has also argued , the rhetorical practices in literary works need to be as much a part of the evidence considered in writing the history of rhetoric as technical handbooks . He has said : <p> To write the history of music merely on the basis of the printed theory , manuals of harmony and counterpoint , is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music also . To write the history of rhetoric merely from the text-books may be deeply misleading : the plays of Shakespeare , the poetry of Donne and Sidney , are better guides to the potentialities of rhetoric than all the text-books put together . Yet they could not have been written without those text-books . A full history will involve both theory and artefact . ( " Rhetorical and anti-rhetorical tropes " 108 ) <p> <p> Even if the artistry in Titus Andronicus is uneven , Shakespeare 's stylistic self-consciousness at the beginning of his career shows that a sophisticated rhetorical understanding guides his craftsmanship and corroborates this need for literary works to be included with rhetorical handbooks in our studies of Renaissance beliefs about imitation and style . As T. W. Baldwin has convincingly documented in his two volume Shakspeare 's Small Latine &; Lesse Greeke , Shakespeare received the standardized grammar school education of his time , an education based in the classical trivium of grammar , logic , and rhetoric . Consequently , his practice of the language arts can give us important clues as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary periods . <p>
