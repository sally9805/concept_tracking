Section : Nation &; World With its tail broken off , a fully loaded airliner crashes in Queens <p> It was too soon , too close , and far too awful . Barely two months after a pair of hijacked planes plowed into the World Trade Center , another fiery crash stunned New York City  --  this time an Airbus 300 plunging into a residential Queens neighborhood . But instead of the stunned silence and haze of confusion that followed the September 11 holocaust , within minutes firefighters were dousing burning homes and federal officials , too , were moving with alacrity and authority . Within an hour , the Federal Aviation Administration had issued an advisory saying there was no evidence of terrorist involvement , and by the following day the National Transportation Safety Board was reading snatches from pilot recordings that indicated the aircraft had hit the wake of a preceding plane . And although it insisted it would not rule out foul play , the NTSB , too , said at every opportunity that it found no evidence criminal activity had caused the crash that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Instead , in seeking why the American Airlines flight went awry soon after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport , the NTSB made clear its focus was on the baffling loss of the aircraft 's tail and the wicked air currents it encountered in another flight 's wake . <p> High alert . The initial findings may have quelled terrorism fears , but they kicked the nation 's air-safety system into high alert . The FAA ordered an immediate inspection of all 90 Airbus A300 planes in service in the United States , focusing especially on the tail assembly  --  a mandate that affects American Airlines , Federal Express , and UPS . Yet despite the wealth of information investigators gleaned last week  --  the plane was not submerged and large portions were intact  --  plenty of questions remain . The flight appeared to have encountered strong wake turbulence from a Japan Airlines 747 that took off about two minutes earlier . But few industry experts believe such rough air currents alone could have caused the accident . Instead , attention in coming weeks is sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft 's tail , which sheared cleanly from the plane 's body and was found floating one half mile from the crash site in Jamaica Bay . " This is really the tip of the iceberg , " said Marion Blakey , a former top federal highway safety official , who took over as NTSB chair in late September . " It will be many months before we really will have a complete and clear picture . " <p> Still , it was not surprising that the crash of the Dominican Republic-bound flight that shattered a clear Veterans Day morning initially spelled terror to many . " They 're looking for the terrorists now , " grumbled one man staring past the police barrier into the crash site three blocks away . Bridge and tunnel traffic halted throughout New York , the United Nations was locked down , and the Empire State Building was evacuated . The three major airports in the area were shut down for five hours while officials checked whether jet fuel had been contaminated  --  either deliberately or accidentally . <p> The fuel turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have been left by a bomb  --  nor were there signs of failure in the two massive engines , which landed largely intact . Instead , attention turned to the vertical tail fin of the jetliner . Its location suggested that it was the first part to break off the aircraft  --  an event that most likely sealed the flight 's fate . Without the tail fin , the airplane would have rolled uncontrollably . Even though there are exceptions  --  in the early 1960s , a U.S. B-52 lost a major portion of its tail and somehow landed safely  --  most experts agree with the judgment of David Evans , editor of Air Safety Week : " If the tail goes , it 's a death sentence . " The force of the ensuing spin would have been sufficient to dislodge the engines . <p> The cockpit recording showed that the pilots remarked on a " wake encounter , " that is , rough air currents caused by the wake of a flight ahead . Those currents , which trail like two tightly wound tornadoes from the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more and linger as long as 15 minutes . Federal regulators have set standards separating flights to avoid these vortexes ; Flight 587 's takeoff was spaced as the rules require . The " black box , " or flight data recorder , recovered at the crash scene suggests the flight encountered two such wakes . Then the plane experienced three jolts  --  two to one side , one to the opposite side  --  that preceded loss of control . The rudder on the tail fin moved at the same time as those shoves , but it is unclear whether the pilot or a malfunction moved the rudder so sharply . Next , data from the rudder became muddled  --  some think this was when the tail came off  --  and the aircraft rolled and plunged , with passengers feeling at least twice the force of gravity . " What we have is a confusing picture and a very wild ride on the aircraft , " said former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall . <p> Tongues . NTSB member George Black said that the vertical fin probably broke without the pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearview mirror . " It sheared at the six tongues , or attachments , which mount fin to fuselage . These tongues were made of carbon-fiber-reinforced , high-strength plastic  --  one of the man-made composites increasingly substituted for metal in aircraft because they are considered stronger , noncorrosive , and light . Airbus Industrie , in fact , intends to construct much of the fuselage of its new generation of A380 luxury superjets out of composite . But experts say the Flight 587 crash is sure to prompt a harder look at how composites perform under stress and over time . " Composite material is basically a new science , " says Greg Feith , former lead investigator for the NTSB . " This is where the FAA is going to be spending a lot of money . " <p> Of special concern are the composites on this particular jet : One of the tongues had been repaired in 1988 after the layers of graphite had begun to separate from each other , or " delaminate . " Feith says an improper repair may have created a weakness that lay dormant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 turbulence incident in the Caribbean , severe enough to injure 47 passengers , damaged the tail . The plane 's most recent inspection was 1999 . Regulators will certainly consider whether new materials require different inspection procedures , such as greater use of ultrasound . <p> Even so , as in most crashes of modern , highly engineered planes , pinpointing a cause will not be simple . Especially vexing is the question of whether the sharp rudder movements were the result of pilot error , autopilot malfunction , or a structural failure never before seen . Rudy Kapustin , a former NTSB investigator who handled one of the agency 's most important wind-vortex investigations in 1972 , says a combination of factors surely was at play . " In almost every accident , one thing happens that in and of itself would not create a life-threatening situation , " he says . " But you add one ingredient to the mixing bowl , and something else happens , and it 's like a domino effect . You have a catastrophic result .
