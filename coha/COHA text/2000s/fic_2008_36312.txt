He was five feet one inch tall in street shoes , bearlike in his round and jowly face , hulking in his chest and shoulders , nearly just as stout around the middle , but hollow in the hips , and lacking a proper can to sit on ( though he was hardly ever known to sit ) , and wee at the ankles , and girlish at his tiny feet , a man in the shape of a lightbulb . He was faintly green-skinned , psoriatic about the elbows and the backs of the knees , his shaven cheeks untouched by scars of any sort , faithful to a fault to his daily labors , grudgeless against the wicked world , thankful for it , even ; a baker of breads with and without seeds , modest cakes , seasonal frosted treats ; supplier to all the neighborhood and occasional passers-through ; a reader of the p.m. papers , as all of his vocation are , born on the feast of Saint Lucy , 1895 ; a prideful Ohioan ; a sucker of caramel candies when cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a broad and seamless brow and a head of sleek black undulant hair , the eyes goonish , unnaturally pale and blue , set deep in the skull in swollen rain-cloud pouches , the eyes of one poisoned with lead , who had not in all his days addressed a piece of speech to more than two persons at once ; a looker-right-through-you if he pleased , as old cats look , accustomed to suffering the company of others but always in need of privacy ; the baker of Elephant Park ; an unambitious businessman ; a soul liberated from worry by luck and self-conquest ; a weak hearted sparer of the rod with his boys ; a measured drinker of spirits who prayed daily for the salvation of his sons and wife ; a smoker nevertheless immune to colds and grippes ; an ignorer of the weather ; a lover of streaks , content and merciful ; an unremarkable Christian . <p> The day 's fifteen hours of labor he divided into three parts : six in the kitchen , solitary ; six at the register in front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of others not his own ; three again in back , solitary once more unless one of his boys attended him . He was the father of three sons . <p> Of these it was never the first or last who pried open the back-alley bakery door , the hickory-dickory-dock door , it was called , and came inside to sit post school with his father while he worked . It was the middle one , unfriended , while the others were lost to the streets . It was Mimmo only ever who came and kept company with him , a boy mute , imperious , sweetly piss-smelling , stool-top observer of things spectral and material , who instead of football and coal-thieving from the rail yards opened the alley-oop door , as it was also called ( there was n't any handle and the lock was long busted , but a stick wedged in the bottom right corner would send it swinging ) , and unlonesomed the hottest hours in the back of the bakery afternoons , when the ovens smoldered for the night and the glass doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In truth the baker wished his first or last would come instead , the two that owned their mother 's talent for flattery , chin-wagging , exuberant high-pitched singing of patriotic songs , not to say of scrubbing and sweeping . <p> Despite all his thrift and provide a private room for their sleeping-all three shared a Murphy bed in the parlor-or , in truth , at times , to furnish the Sunday table with meat or poultry ; or to purchase decorator items to enliven the parlor walls , or flounces for the curtain hems , or a sign of any kind to label the bakery storefront ; or to pay an assistant 's wage , so that all the bakery 's many chores he did himself . The boys he kept in school . Their mother rolled counterfeit Cuban cigars at the kitchen table . <p> D'Agostino , the usurer that owned the consignment store , one of his clientele , told him it was the superstition that you could n't spend what you did n't yet have that had kept the serfs in the fields . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons and shell your almonds , which goes to show , " he argued . <p> No , but it went to show instead the limit of what the baker should hope to own . He understood that America had become great by extending the right to earn money even to money itself , but this was to his mind a practice of the uttermost corruption , since out of whose hands was the first money taking the second money but those of the man who had made it in the sweat of his brow ? And therefore no account at any bank bore his name , since where would the interest have come from ? Usury ! Although he otherwise felt toward his chosen country a tenderness only such as he had seen young girls struggle to conceal for their fathers . <p> His hopes instead were unpurchasable and plain . He knew what they were-well , he knew what one of them was , he could describe it in words but would n't tell you if you asked because it was not for your ears . He was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his clientele , even the children among them , did not use his family name but called him Rocco , as though he were their servant or cousin . <p> He was susceptible to dread . <p> At the least expected time of sweet lonesomeness , in the earliest of morning hours , while he bumbled down the bepuddled alleys beneath the tenement balconettes , where in summer months the caged-in children snored beneath the washing , under the yellow-dark clouds of coal smoke , dread leapt from the shadows and pounded him in his face . Or later , at four in the a.m. , while he filled the proofing shelves with the day 's 180 oblong loaves , slowly but slowly rising all around him , all white ( picture a colossus in a mausoleum of innocents ) ; or while he was coaling the oven , the dread descended and clocked him . At such times , what could he do to protect himself but name the dread and hope that that would sap its force ? So he spoke inwardly the Biblical warning that described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and described as well what his role was in the universal scheme and the consequences of failing in that role . The first time he heard it was at the mass for the last one 's baptism . Monsignor read it in Latin , and he did n't follow ; then in Italian , and he was n't paying any attention ; then in English , and it did its terrible work : " Behold , I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord : And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse . " <p> He was the father of three sons . He loved them so , as the Lord required . Mrs. Loveypants , their mother , also called Luigina , was beloved of him , too , but collaterally , as the vessel by which his boys had blessed him . <p> They were boys , and therefore their souls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating of salt with watermelon , and the middle and last took the habit up shamelessly , imitating also the first 's wincing and puckering , and shot the seeds off their tongues like savages at passing dogs . They ran away from home and yet came back . They were innocent of resolve . They were as vulnerable to their surroundings as mold . For this he might have congratulated them : They were Americans after all , who felt nerves where older nations felt fear , and a million possible nervous selves crowded around them , clamoring to be chosen , and his eager boys looked perpetually in all directions for the one they most desired to be , always in a state of becoming . He himself , on the other hand , had long since finished becoming and therefore faced fewer , more concentrated , and infinitely more terrifying uncertainties-the hour of his death , the resilience of his faith in the Lord . He might have congratulated them if only he could have assured himself that all of their becoming would at some point in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become : the ease of physical comportment , the directness of gaze and speech , the freedom from the desire to seem , also the ability to pray without requesting something for oneself . His own father had a word that described this , and here was Rocco 's hope , the thing he would n't have told you because it was n't yours and he did n't want to dishonor it by explaining . It was something he wanted for his boys , whom he loved as himself-he hoped that the boys , once men , would harden . Think of a brick in a kiln . His father had achieved this , his grandfather more so , and it was evinced by the rain-cloud pouches about their eyes . " Do n't associate with people who touch their faces while they talk to you , " said his father . " That 's not what the hands are for . " <p> Now , take his boys . He did not understand why they must always be smiling ! They were taught in the schools to shake hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were horses offered for inspection . They were not horses ! They were Christian persons , but they laughed at what was n't funny because they desired above all things not to become hard but to become liked , and it made Rocco 's blood boil because they were putting themselves up for sale . And in his eyes , as in the eyes of the Lord , they were beyond price . <p> Three boys , one two three , and him their father , and Loveypants . <p> One of his cousins had had a cousin he wanted Rocco to meet , and that was Loveypants ( although yet to acquire the name ) , and they had gotten married . All right , it was marginally more complicated than that . This was in the city of Omaha , in the Nebraska , where he had immigrated at first and found work goading steers onto and off the trains . Woodrow Wilson had just had his stroke , and Rocco was in grief on account of Edith , the young bride who had rescued Wilson from his widowerhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , where was Rocco 's place of work but a rail yard , among trains that had come from far-off infected ports in the east , south , and west . It was like the heat of a furnace , this dread , like the hot breath of the Lord blowing on him , saying , Harden . So he said to Loveypants , with whom he 'd been sharing insufficiently reserved boxcar liaisons , " I guess we 'd better get married . " To which she responded , " We agree . " And due to his already having shamed her , he received no dowry , which was not unjust . <p> Loveypants , Luigina , drove a spear through the heart of the Rocco of becoming and watched it beat its last . Once he was hardened , his father had prophesied , the things of his softness would look shameful to him , and so they did . And he abandoned salooning , urinating from high windows , weekly letters home to Mother in Catania , and finally the Nebraska itself , and bought two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What remained of the life of the Rocco of becoming was little else but Loveypants , who herself had hardened admirably , and to whom the name Loveypants ( her boxcar name , her own invention , which she preferred ) did not apply anymore in the same degree , but a word is a harder thing to spear and kill than a person . <p> In December 1919 , Loveypants and Rocco reached their destination and disembarked from the train . Her hair was in tangles . Snow caught in the fuzz of her limp cloth coat . The tin reinforcing cups on the corners of her trunk hissed on the ice as she dragged it by a belt tied to its handle , while the other baggage she carried in a tarpaulin bundle on her back . Down the Ohio road she pulled her things , pregnant , singing to him . <p> Four and a half years later , which would be three years into his apprenticeship under the baker Modiano , the old man , anticipating retirement , offered to lease the bakery to Rocco until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he to raise the money ? For a day , he considered , and then , in a flash , his plan came to him : He would simply open the store every day . Without exception . The Sabbath be damned , and Christmas and Pentecost . Loveypants was not the only one to express skepticism about this plan , but he proceeded in the teeth of doubting Thomases and Tomasinas . <p> Therefore his streak began , and his fidelity to it was absolute down the many years , and labor coursed continually over his willing shoulders as though he had determined to build his house under a waterfall . <p> " But now begins a journey in my head , to work my mind , when body 's work 's expired , " recited the green-eyed first one , standing atop the down-folded Murphy bed in the parlor while Loveypants prompted him from a school reader ; and Rocco , despite his own best efforts , saw his focus go slack , and splayed himself on the rug , the bag-of-bones last one that would not eat his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle one , the Buddha , his legs crossed , watching from his accustomed perch within the armoire . From Rocco consciousness began to take its nightly four-hour leave . What he would give to forswear sleep ! If God was good , on the other side he 'd give Rocco back such hours that sleeping took , post supper in the parlor , the spit of the papoose on his sleeve . <p> Loveypants applauded . The armoire hinges complained as the middle one shut himself inside . And Rocco slept . <p> And trouble came . <p> No sooner had he finally bought the old man out , after fifty-two months of leasing , than the store began to sink . It was the beginning of the panic . Free enterprise was bunk after all . For example : A child needs milk for his bones but his father ca n't afford any ; a certain Swede of the father 's acquaintance , a dairy farmer on the South Side , dumps fifty gallons daily of whole cow 's milk that nobody can afford to buy into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is demand , but there is no money . And yet money does n't exist , really ; it 's more a theory ; and so the root cause of so much waste was the lack of something that did not exist . For example : The loaf that Rocco slides from his peel onto the cooling rack has a splendidly chewy crumb , holes of many sizes and shapes , a light crust that shatters against the teeth . It has , at the moment he opens his store , just reached room temperature and is at its peak of texture and taste . In comes his clutch of clients who neglect entirely this living object of his art for yesterday 's dead leavings , available to them at half price . Today 's will sell tomorrow . God bless us . <p> He had no debts but his boys were n't fed so his streak endured . <p> With Roosevelt came relief , and Rocco was nearly ruined . Bread they gave for free to anybody willing to wait in line . Cotton wool , he should say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half ( he asked one of the miserable scabs employed to bake it ) and cooked in a lukewarm gas-fired oven . Now the bread that issued from Rocco 's oven on a Wednesday morning was the fulfillment of dough he 'd started Sunday night . Look at the blistery , bark like surface of the thing he made . Put it in your mouth and press it with your tongue . He asked the Lord what had become of shame . Meantime , agents of the federal government were buying piglets and sows and incinerating them in a starving nation because they were not expensive enough . In the winter , to save on coal , Rocco and the boys and Loveypants slept in cots in the bakery kitchen . The last boy got scurvy . Briefly , Loveypants believed that she was pregnant again , but malnutrition had merely made her monthly irregular . Then her mother , living in the New Jersey now and widowed , wrote on a postcard that through the intercession of a certain Alfred , step brother of the deceased father , Loveypants could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This uncle offered as well a bed in his home-there , in the New Jersey-that could sleep two in one direction and perhaps a third crosswise at the foot , if this third , the postcard concluded , was shorter than four feet tall . <p> This is the tale of the man whose bucket leaked on his way home from the well . <p> Here is what they did . She took the first and last with her and the middle stayed with Rocco . Once the store prospered again they would regroup themselves . <p> Mimmo , the middle one , Mimmino , now the baron unchallenged of all the parlor , was no longer called upon to share the water in his bath . When a chicken could be found , both drumsticks were his , and the fat gleamed on his great teeth . Within a year he overgrew his father . He undressed himself while standing on the furnace grate , a suit of white flesh , immaculate , grown from Rocco 's meager seed , and Rocco pulled the bed down from the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . He could not bake or add or sew or read and would not learn . Mornings , five hours after Rocco had left him mid sleep in the house , he stumbled into the bakery for his breakfast . He sat and ate an egg and ate a roll . Rocco dripped some oil upon his comb and pulled it through the boy 's unruly , nigrous hair . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
