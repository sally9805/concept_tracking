Karl Lagerfeld on th Mystique of Coco Chanel On the eve of the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's Costume Institute exhibition , Karl Lagerfeld , the heir to fashion s most enduring icon , opens up to Bazaar on his predecessor s legacy and why the archive is a constant source of inspiration . By Kristina O'Neill // For the house that made the number five an international symbol of chic sophistication , it 's fitting that an exhibition examining Chanel 's history would open in the fifth month of the year 2005 . Five , of course , was Gabrielle " Coco " Chanel 's lucky number , and it seems to have played favorably for the house she founded in 1913 and designed for until her death in 1971 . In 1983 , long before it became trendy to install new names at storied brands , Karl Lagerfeld took the reins and galloped the house into the 21st century . In the much-anticipated Met show , the curators , with Lagerfeld 's input , will juxtapose the two designers ' work , revealing their mutual fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason they both , in real time , captivated not only their customers but their peers as well . Chanel : A lucky house indeed . Harper 's Bazaar : Tell me about the Met exhibition and why you refuse to call it a retrospective . Karl Lagerfeld : I hate retrospective . People like Chanel , Balenciaga , Vionnet-they never had an exhibition in their lifetimes like the ones people want to have now . Now they all want exhibitions . They Chanel , Balenciaga , Vionnet dressed people , and that 's what 's interesting . Dressing is a reflection of a moment , a period , a time . It 's not interesting to have a retrospective of somebody who 's dead just to show old dresses . That would be very depressing . The Met exhibition is something to inform people how it was through the clothes . HB : What do you think of all the designers who have paid homage to Chanel over the years ? KL : I also hate homage . They call it homage , but you can call it copying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same thing , no ? Everybody copies the uniform , and Chanel suits are a kind of uniform . HB : What makes up this uniform ? What is its eternal appeal ? KL : It 's the easiest look . But you know , what we call the Chanel suit was something she Coco Chanel invented only in the ' ' 50s . The jacket she took from a lift boys uniform in an Austrian hotel . So she found that by putting it on with a skirt , she discovered for women what the two-button suit was for men . It 's very simple . Hers was in fact the easiest and most comfortable way to wear clothes , so it 's normal that people like to copy that idea , because you do n't have an idea like that every week yourself . HB : Most are lucky to come across , what , 10 great ideas in a lifetime ? Except you , that is . KL : Yes , but that 's another story . I 'm a machine ; I 'm not human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so many designers come back to what Coco did so long ago ? KL : Because she was the first to be considered the modern woman . There are not so many ways to dress bodies because they have two arms and two legs and it 's a limited theme . It 's like music : There is only a certain number of notes with which to make it . She found a good tune-and some tunes , like looks , are copied .... So you have to make your own music but put the notes together in a new way so that they look like something from today , like they 've been HB : Sampled . KL : Yes , exactly-sampled . It 's what I call a flea-market pickup . But now we even get lessons from people who buy at the flea market , redo it and then tell us how intellectual they are as designers . HB : What are you interested in preserving of Coco 's legacy ? KL : I do n't preserve anything . I try only to adapt it to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it 's such a strong identity . But identities have to follow fashion . Styles have to follow fashion , too . HB : What do you think made Coco Chanel modern in her time ? KL : She was free . She was n't married . She was not the victim of family life , husband , children ; she could do what she wanted . She was a success very quickly . As a businesswoman , she could say to everybody , " F you . " Which for women was not that common then . HB : Of the women designers working today , who do you think has the essence of Coco ? KL : You know , it 's not because you 're a woman that you get the essence of the clothes of Chanel . You do n't get to say , " I 'm a woman designer ; that essence belongs to me . " Chanel is a trademark . The look belongs to a company that has an identity . It 's beyond just her . So the women designers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prada . KL : She 's very good at the flea market , no ? But she also does it well . I mean , she does it in a more clever way than other people do because she has a kind of talent for that . Yet you can not say that she invents new shapes and new things . She puts old things in another context and makes something new , but it 's very good , too , so I do n't criticize her . Chanel did more or less the same thing , too , in the ' ' 2Os . She was more of a stylist ; Madeleine Vionnet was the couturiere . HB : Many people love Phoebe Philo , the designer of Chloe , because she 's a great stylist . Having once designed for the house , what do you think about her ? KL : I have not seen her collection , but I think it 's quite charming what she does , no ? Phoebe and Stella McCartney are women from another generation , and I think it 's right ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phoebe , I know her less , but she seems quite charming . Chlo is about the way of today . HB : What do you think of designers who are n't afraid to make unflattering clothes-designers who put comfort first ? KL : I can not answer the question ; I have never had their clothes on my back . But , yes , part of what Miuccia came to make was unflattering middle-class-housewife dresses . Yet this is the game , and she is strong enough to impose the emperor 's new clothes on women who think that 's intellectual . HB : What do you think of Rei Kawakubo ? KL : She copies , too , but in her own way . She also picks things up , and she takes them and makes them her own . But I think the interesting thing about Rei and Yohji Yamamoto is that 25 years ago , when they first came to Europe , they broke the image of what is pretty and becoming , and this is what is interesting about them . Now I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all accepted , copied and redone . HB : If you were n't designing for Chanel , would you find her legacy relevant today ? KL : It depends on what kinds of hands it would have fallen into and what the person would have made of it . That is a question with no answer , because I did it . HB : While you were preparing for the exhibition and looking back at Coco 's life , was there anything that you did n't know or that you 're seeing for the first time now ? KL : No . I think I know it quite well , better than curators and editors and everybody else , because I was the one who built the archives . When I arrived , there was no archive . I 'm working on a book of sketches where I sketch an inventory , from the first dress , in the way the clothes were designed by decade and by year . I can sketch well enough to give the attitude of the teens , the ' ' 20s , the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 60s , so people can understand how it evolved . And there are so many misunderstandings , even about the suits , that I think it would be quite interesting to make this kind of inventory . HB : What kinds of misunderstandings ? KL : People think that Chanel did Chanel all her life . She did n't . She was known as the inventor of the little black dress , but in the ' ' 20s , she was also called the Queen of Beige . Now it 's Armani-not the queen , but the beige . HB : What about the other things credited to her : the spectator , the quilted chain-handle handbag ... ? KL : Yes , but she did n't really invent them . The handbag with the chain existed . People forget that . But Chanel put her stamp on it . HB : Do you feel pressure to design modern " icons " ? KL : Yes , but , you know , making an instant icon is very difficult . Today icons are built with advertising . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want it , not because they see it advertised . It 's a very difficult question because we are so into marketing that the marketing people think they are the creators , that they know what the consumer wants . The whole thing is a little out of control , if you ask me . HB : What will be in the Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel archive ? KL : I have no archive . HB : Why not ? KL : I personally think the archive should be your mind , but you should n't dive too deeply into that ; you should go ahead , look , do and forget about archives ! People have archives because they want to have retrospectives . I do n't care , you know . I want a bright future . And I think in fashion you should not remember too well , as I can remember for you . HB : If we had to boil down the essence of Chanel into one word , what would it be ? KL : Coco !
