<p> ' Green ' Gingrich : Responses to " For green solutions , Earth needs a right turn , " @issue , May 6 <p> Self-regulation is only a dream <p> Regarding Newt Gingrich 's so-called Green Conservative approach to the issue of global warming : I believe that industry regulating itself and relying on the ephemeral " market " to lead us to the proper result of clean air and water is naive and ignores how we 've gotten in this mess . <p> As a history buff , Gingrich should know that much of the regulation he rails against ( Clean Air Act , Clean Water Act ) was implemented because industry and the market could not and would not do it themselves . <p> Instead of being good corporate citizens and complying with regulations , industry elected to buy off Congress and the statehouses ( just look at developers here in Georgia ) . <p> The citizens of these United States continue to wait for leadership while watching industry spend money on lawyers and lobbyists to avoid regulation and on studies to prove what anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem with the air . <p> For some reason , history has shown that there was very little conservatism in Gingrich 's conservative revolution so why should we let history repeat itself ? <p> PATRICK J. O'CONNOR , Avondale Estates <p> Do n't drink from this cup <p> Why on earth would anyone trust Newt Gingrich and the Republicans with the environment ? Their previous Contract with America produced 12 years of staggering debt , deceit and governmental incompetence . Their contributions to the Earth included more pollution , fossil fuel dependency and a hysterical denial of global climate change . <p> Gingrich still spews the same toxic rhetoric that brought him to power in the 1990s , but I doubt he will find many people willing to drink his poisoned Kool-Aid this time . <p> It 's painfully clear that we need more respect for science , more maturity and most of all , more love for the Earth and its many inhabitants  --  qualities than extremists such as Gingrich either can not understand or will not embrace . <p> GARY R. MOSS , Atlanta <p> Republicans gutted policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric he introduced for the 1994 election , permanently debasing the political discourse in this country . <p> The fact is that the Republicans ( not to be confused with conservatives ) were in charge of the White House and Congress for the past six years , and systematically gutted regulations protecting our environment while doing absolutely nothing to provide any incentives for industries to " go green . " <p> CLARE DUCEY <p> Atlanta <p> Money and power <p> Newt Gingrich 's Green Conservatism has everything to do with the color of money and nothing to do with the environment . It 's yet another pretty name for maintaining massive corporate incomes that fund dirty political power , and anyone that has paid the slightest attention during the last several years knows it . <p> HEATHER HUNTER , Atlanta <p> Businesses must step up to responsibilities <p> Newt , of course , missed the point on being green . The focus of his diatribe concerns a mythical free market " solution " for a healthy environment . He fails to state why we are now in this mess . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ethical basis for acting in environmentally responsible ways . We live here , we must be responsible stewards of our planet . <p> According to Newt , conservatives think : How can I make money by embracing environmentally responsible behavior ? In the gospel according to Newt , the basic conservative premise is : What is in it for me ? Can I score a buck ? <p> If conservatives had a moral sense , they would have been championing environmentally responsible behavior from the get-go . But all that drives Newt and his pals is money . Had the mythical free market not created these problems , we would not need solutions . But people focused solely on profit are one dimensional . <p> Yes , we live in a great country . But there needs to be more to life than just money . Businesses and individuals need to take leadership roles because it is the moral and ethical thing to do . Period . <p> HARRY HAFF , Alpharetta <p> Immigration : Responses to Cynthia Tucker 's column " U.S. ca n't risk a return to McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on voter records <p> Cynthia Tucker wo n't honestly debate 10th Congressional District candidate Jim Whitehead 's accusations of illegal immigrant voting . She just viciously smears him with name-calling and simply dismisses the issue of noncitizen voting . <p> There are many examples of noncitizen voting . The most notorious involved a 1996 California congressional race narrowly won by Democrat Loretta Sanchez . A secretary of state 's probe found at least 748 illegal aliens voted ( and more would have been discovered but they stopped counting ) . A congressional probe confirmed it occurred because the Hermandad Mexicana Nacional group committed fraud during its voter registration drive . <p> A 2005 review by Harris County , Texas  --  the third largest county in the country  --  found at least 35 cases in which noncitizens received a voter card . Bear in mind , the registrar noted , that " we regularly have elections decided by just a handful of votes in any one of our more than 400 local government jurisdictions . " <p> A congressional candidate has a responsibility to make noncitizen voting a campaign issue  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a driver 's license , and states by law must offer voter registration to people who apply for a license . <p> PHIL KENT <p> Kent , of Atlanta , is national spokesman for Americans for Immigration Control . <p> McCarthyism is already present <p> Cynthia Tucker 's column on the risk of the United States returning to the McCarthyism of the 1950s is another sign on how out of touch she is with reality . We already are in the process of McCarthyism right now . It 's called " political correctness . " <p> The passage of HR 1592 in the U.S. House on a federal " hate crimes " legislation is nothing more than thought control and an effort to criminalize Christianity in this country . <p> President Bush should veto this bill , but I fear if the Democrats take control of the White House in 2008 , we will be seeing the Christian version of " The Night of The Long Knives " of June 30 to July 2 , 1934 , or the Christian version of " Kristallnacht " of Nov. 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covington <p> Why repeat failed legalization scheme ? <p> Wow ! This is rich : On illegal immigration , Cynthia Tucker writes about " McCarthyism " and " smear tactics " while she advocates  --  again  --  for a repeat of the failed legalization scheme of 1986 . Then she uses fellow traveler Tom Crawford as a source . <p> " Jingoists , " " nativist , " " demagoguery , " " whipping up worst instincts " and " no lie is too shameful . " Oh , my ! <p> Tucker , the queen of smear , is ever ready to justify the crime of illegal immigration in the name of diversity and has once again demonstrated her total lack of shame in attacking Americans who oppose her . <p> SUE KING , Marietta <p> Terrorists do seek to register to vote <p> Cynthia Tucker 's accusations against state Sen. Jim Whitehead were unfair and poorly researched . Tucker first likens Whitehead to the infamous U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy  --  no small charge . She then claims that a statement on terrorists registering to vote by Whitehead was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , but she failed to do so . Is n't this exactly what she 's accused Whitehead of doing ? However , Whitehead can reference where his claim originates  --  a Oct. 24 , 2004 , in the Columbus Dispatch by Jon Craig , which reports illegal alien Nuradin Abdi , the shopping mall bomb plotter from Somalia , was registered to vote in the state of Ohio . <p> In light of this , I hope Tucker affords her readers a little fact checking in the future . <p> HOLLY CROFT , Evans <p> Cooking hardly just recreational <p> I think that Meghan Daum makes some interesting points about the stats and reality that are worth considering ( " A woman 's work " @issue , May 6 ) . <p> I must , however , take exception to her cooking example . Cooking may be viewed as a recreational activity . If so , what would you categorize the planning , purchasing , prep and clean-up ? <p> My husband , fortunately , has become involved in the whole process , which makes it much more pleasant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals just do n't appear . <p> I have an elderly friend who confided in me that she has been making breakfast , lunch and dinner for 60 years . She wondered when she will get to " retire " ? <p> JUDY O'REILLY , Stockbridge <p> Vegans enjoy nutritious diets  --  not type associated with baby 's death <p> Please stop identifying Jade Sanders and Lamont Thomas as the " vegan " parents who starved their baby to death ( " Mom fears son 's veganism is death sentence in prison , " Metro , May 10 ) . They are not vegan in any accurate sense of the word , and using that term in relation to this awful crime misrepresents and maligns true vegans . <p> There are thousands of vegans and vegetarians in Georgia and worldwide who lead robust , normal lives and who usually enjoy better-than-average health because they do n't eat the meat and dairy foods that are strongly linked to cancer , heart disease , diabetes and other deadly ailments . A vegan diet is a positive lifestyle , and one that many would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know little about nutrition , regardless of what diet they claim to follow , and their ignorance and negligence led to the tragic death of an innocent child . They deserve the punishment that comes with that , but true vegans do not deserve to be painted with the same brush . <p> JILL HOWARD CHURCH <p> Church , of Atlanta , is president of the Vegetarian Society of Georgia . <p> Costly rush after oil <p> We shell out millions of dollars trying to buy the favors of untrustworthy warlords in Afghanistan , but when U.S. soldiers kill 19 innocent civilians , we apologize and pay " about $2,000 for each death " ( " U.S. ' sorry ' for killings of civilians by Marines , " News , May 9 ) . <p> Is it any wonder that our heavy-handed actions in Afghanistan as well as Iraq are losing us the support of the people ? <p> Had we stayed in Afghanistan from the get-go and pursued Osama bin Laden with vigor instead of pulling out the bulk of our forces to attack a county that had not attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job he now holds  --  king . But there 's oil in Iraq . <p> DOLPH HONICKER , LaGrange <p> To drive down prices , cut demand for gas <p> I read with interest the May 10 letter " Gas prices : Start a boycott " that recommends a boycott of Exxon Mobil to drive gasoline prices down to 87 cents per gallon , a level not seen here for nine years . <p> It 's a stupid , simplistic idea . Boycotting Exxon Mobil  --  or any other oil company  --  will not make the price of gasoline fall one iota . The only way to cause the price of gasoline to come down is to buy less gasoline . Period . <p> Gasoline and the crude oil from which it is produced are commodities , and refiners constantly buy and sell product from each other to balance supply and demand . <p> Assuming you do n't trim your gasoline usage , if you buy less from Exxon Mobil , you 'll buy more from some other refiner . Overall market demand will stay the same , and the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon on one side , it 'll just pooch out more on the other side , unless you shrink the balloon . That means buying smaller , more fuel-efficient cars and carpooling . <p> STEVE KRODMAN , Marietta <p> Iraq war : It 's time to leave , save our troops <p> Adding the publication of former CIA Director George Tenet 's new tell-all tome " At the Center of the Storm " to overwhelming evidence already known , it has become abundantly clear that someone lied and started a war . Who did the deed , and who irresponsibly considered the lie ample justification for killing more than 3,000 of our brightest and best , and tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens , is a question that can be answered in due course . <p> The unforgivable tragedy is that we 're endlessly debating whether to continue this abomination . Congress authorized the war , and the squabble over funding is wrongheaded . The most effective method of ending this American tragedy of epic proportions is to withdraw authorization . Supply all funding necessary to keep our troops safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no longer play in their deadly sandbox at the expense of our finest young men and women . <p> America used to be a beacon of freedom , but now we 've become a nation that kills without provocation , tortures without mercy and lies to keep it all going . <p> ROY JAMES STEWART , Avondale Estates Photo : Jade Sanders/ImageData* ImageData* Photo : To curb global warming , Newt Gingrich touts " Green Conservatism , " instead of big bureaucracy. /ImageData* ImageData* Photo : BEN GRAY / StaffState Sen.
