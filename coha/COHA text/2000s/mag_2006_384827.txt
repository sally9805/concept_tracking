Even in a world of dire need , it 's still possible : one person with one idea can improve the lives of many . // WHEN disaster strikes and shocking scenes flood our screens , thousands of us are moved to respond . We donate time , money and services . We send along blankets , prayers and toys . Across the country , charitable giving rose 5 percent in 2004 , to nearly $250 billion . With its horrific calamities , 2005 is likely to top that . As the images ebb , most of us retreat , comforted by the feeling that we stepped up . But in the breach that remains , some unusual people step forward rather than back . They journey right into the path of disaster . These dedicated few share our compassion , and they do something more . They keep working for change . In this special issue of Town &; Country , we report on six people who exemplify the rare power of one : lone individuals who make an extraordinary difference in alleviating the fears and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than look on . Facing a Goliath of need in their chosen arenas , they have rewritten the rules of what 's possible . Little by little , day by day , these are people who harness the power of one to beat back the tide of need . Each leans forward , right into the storm . The Advocate ANTHONY KENNEDY SHRIVER Founder and chairman , FIRST BUDDIES INTERNATIONAL , bestbuddies.org , Miami His uncles were President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy . His dad , Sargent Shriver , was the first director of the Peace Corps . So in 1988 , after graduating from Georgetown University , Anthony Kennedy Shriver had his pick of privileged paths . " In the back of my mind , I figured I 'd study for the LSATs in the fall and head for law school , " he says . But that summer , Shriver decided to travel to look into state funding for a small organization he had formed at Georgetown . The group , called Best Buddies , fostered one-on-one friendships between students and people with intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits his childhood relationship with his mentally disabled aunt , Rosemary , for giving him an appreciation for the talents of intellectually challenged people . " I used to think how disabled she was , how she could n't do simple tasks by herself or do anything you need to do to be considered successful in America , " he recalls . " Then one day she jumped in the pool , and she could swim better than anyone else in the family . Every person has a skill set . " If his aunt was a guiding spirit-later in her life she spent two months every winter with Shriver 's family-it was his mother who offered the model . Shriver got the idea for Best Buddies from attending the Special Olympics , the international athletic competition for mentally disabled people , founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver . At SO events on campuses , he noted that the athletes did well when local students looked after them . On their own , afterward , the athletes had a more difficult time . Back at Georgetown , Shriver set up Best Buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled friends . He never did make it to law school . " I met some people in Tallahassee who offered to provide funding for the program statewide , and that 's how I wound up in Florida , " says Shriver . " Students at different schools would hear what a great experience Best Buddies was and want to form a chapter . I never had a plan . It took on a life of its own . " Working fifteen-hour days and leveraging trademark Kennedy traitsunfailing courtesy and charm , high-level access , the charismatic grin , those cheekbones-Shriver has built Best Buddies into a worldwide nonprofit with programs in all fifty states and twenty-two countries . Annual donations now exceed $20 million . The organization provides opportunities for the intellectually disabled at any age and serves a quarter of a million people . Highprofile fundraisers , some attended by supporters like Shriver 's uncle Senator Edward Kennedy and sister , Maria Shriver , help fuel growth . " I 'd like to go beyond friendships and jobs and move into housing , " says Shriver , who turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Cubanborn former ballerina who is now an artist 's representative , have four kids . Everyone in the family except the four-year-old has a Best Buddy . " Most of the problems fade when one human being gets to know someone , " explains Shriver . " So in twenty years , I hope I wo n't have to be doing this , because people will find out what people with intellectual disabilities can offer without getting matched up or filling out forms . " The Healer ASTRID HEPPENSTALL HEGER , M.D. Founding executive director , VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM , **31;1290;TOOLONG , Los Angeles It seems unthinkable today . But in 1983 , when pediatrician Astrid Heppenstall Heger volunteered to work at Los Angeles County Hospital + USC Medical Center , children who had been sexually abused were examined not once but over and over so that experts could testify about the injuries at every court hearing . Heger was outraged by the additional and unnecessary trauma . She was incensed by how often such cases were lost anyway because the " evidence " was so subjective . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual abuse was happening , and many cases were n't prosecuted , " says Heger , whose cool blonde looks belie her fiery determination . " There was no science . Anybody could say anything . " In reaction , Heger pioneered the use of photo documentation and rigorous methods of evaluation so that kids would be physically examined only once . In 1984 her efforts paid off , setting legal precedent in California and creating new standards across the country . " Scientific documentation brought authenticity to the investigation and allowed cases to go forward , " she explains . From there , with only a trickle of funding and no salary or staff , Heger began treating vulnerable children in a temporary clinic , an abandoned trailer located on the center 's parking lot . Authorities kept warning her off . " One administrator told me to cease and desist because building programs to deliver services for women and children was not a priority . " Heger 's soft voice gets even quieter . " It amused me to drive my truck around that guy , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police officers kept bringing her victims of family violence . There was nowhere else for them to go . " Against all odds . " Heger says , " I decided to methodically build a system that would deliver quality care and demonstrate to bureaucrats that keeping families together could create an economic model that would save money . " In 2001 Heger 's programs officially became the LAC+USC Medical Center 's Violence Intervention Program ( VIP ) , which raised $2 million and moved into a renovated facility in 2003 . Today , with an $8 million operating budget from government contracts , VIP is a care center that annually evaluates more than 5,000 victims of family violence , sexual assault and elder abuse . Recently divorced and with three grown sons , Heger runs VlP , teaches , writes , testifies as a medical expert and has been showered with awards . But she 's far from satisfied . For Heger , success is measured only by how effectively VIP stops violence and helps victims . " You 're not allowed to use Medicaid to pay for things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids can smile again after their faces have been beaten to a pulp for years , " she says . In response , VIP supporters have launched H.E.A.R.T . ( Helping Ease Abuse-Related Trauma ) , a group that raises about $100,000 a year privately for such family needs . " We 're the only center that does this . " There 's no question that I work in a very dark place , " Heger continues . " But there are people who get it and make it possible to grow new programs . I hear about acts of horrible meanness , violation and abuse every day . But it 's the acts of kindness that really make me weep . " The Coach DAKRYL LESTER Founder , HINDSIGHT CONSULTING , hindsightconsulting.org ; cofounder , NEXT GENERATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PHILANTHROPISTS , ngaapfund.org , Raleigh , North Carolina After years as an administrator of student affairs at universities and as a program director for community foundations , Darryl Lester got the message . " Whenever people talked about who was philanthropic , it was always folks in a certain part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never on the supply side of philanthropy . They were only on the demand side . I struggled with that . " In 2001 Lester walked away from big institutions to work on changing that image . " I deal with the mind-set that philanthropy is what someone else docs , " he says . " But the motivations for giving are the same for everyone . When you break philanthropy into its three tenets-time , talent and treasure-that resonates with people . You have to be willing to ask . " Nowadays , Lester , forty-three , who is based in Raleigh , North Carolina , travels around the South , putting his mouth and livelihood where his heart and mind ended up . " I was raised in a small rural community that understood that sacrifices come with the things you inherit . I realized that organizing and talking to friends about making a change in the world is something I actually believe in . " Another part of Lester 's motivation comes from his four-yearold daughter , Danielle , who was born with a disorder of the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an electrical engineer , shifted career priorities to spend more time with Danielle and to work with groups that raise funds for therapeutic horseback riding , which helps kids like her . Lester 's key tool to develop philanthropy in black communities has been organizing giving circles . A fast-growing charitable model found across the economic spectrum in some forty states , giving circles are small groups of neighbors and friends who pool contributions and make collective decisions about grant giving . His initial circle , Next Generation of African American Philanthropists , founded in 2003 , now has about twenty-five members and has spawned similar circles in five other Southern cities . The required annual donation is $250 , though many give more . " It was a little tough at first , " says Lester . " But by now people have seen the difference they 've created . In the philanthropic world , a small grant does n't have major impact . But when grassroots organizations receive grants of $500 to $1,000 to support staff development or to earn matching gifts from a foundation , the ripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his circle gave out grants totaling $11,000 , which helped support a residence for African-American women with AIDS and a group that offers a range of computer classes for single moms and their kids . " Giving circles change the face of what a donor looks like in the community , " says Lester . " I want philanthropists to look like Darryl Lester . " The Activist HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Cofounder , WOMEN 'S FUNDING NETWORK , wfnet.org , San Francisco ; founder , NEW YORK WOMEN 'S FOUNDATION , nywf.org ; founder , DALLAS WOMEN 'S FOUNDATION , **26;1323;TOOLONG " When you bring women and money together , you create a lot of tension and new power , " says Helen LaKelly Hunt . She should know . As an heir and the second-youngest daughter of Texas oil billionaire H.L. Hunt , the man who supposedly inspired the TV show Dallas , Hunt was raised as a Southern belle who was expected to please others . " Men handled money , and women did n't , " she says . " It kept women from being whole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like my father 's bigamy and my mother 's unspoken pain , " as she puts it in her recent book , Faith and Feminism . Her father had children with three women and , for a while , was married to two of them at the same time . After moving to New York as a young divorced mother of two in the 1970s , Hunt was galvanized by the rising women 's movement . " When Betty Friedan talked of the ' feminine mystique " that buried hundreds of American women alive , she was talking about me , " Hunt has said . She decided to put her own wealth to strategic work . Two decades ago , scarcely 3 percent of total annual foundation grants went to women 's causes . " Women suffer the burden of poverty around the world , yet the philanthropic flow tends to be controlled by white men on boards . They do n't think of funding women , " says Hunt . In 1984 she cofounded and subsidized the Women 's Funding Network ( originally the National Network of Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private foundations , individual donors and other allies that leverage resources and tools for women 's causes . Hunt went on to create and fund two women 's community foundations-in Dallas , in 1985 , and New York , in 1987-both of which are WFN members . Today , with 113 members worldwide , WFN has collective assets of nearly $275 million and annual member grants totaling $50 million . These grants help women build job skills , start businesses , leave violent homes and gain access to health care . Funding goes to rape crisis centers , domestic-abuse shelters and groups trying to stem the international human-slave trade . Still , twenty years later , only 7 percent of foundation grants flow to women 's causes . WFN reports that the nation has four times more shelters for animals than for battered women . Overall , Hunt , now fifty-seven , has donated several million dollars , helped raise millions more and dedicated thirty years to bolstering women 's rights to prosper and feel safe . That includes the $5 million she has given away through her private foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters and an executive director . Married to couples therapist and author Harville Hendrix , with whom she works . Hunt has six children altogether from her two marriages . With increased money and more independence , says Hunt , women who give today are coming from a wider range of incomes and backgrounds . " There 's now a committed stream of women with the impulse and the passion to give , " she adds . " WFN is just hitting its stride . " The Mentor CARLA ANN HARRIS Managing director , MORGAN STANLEY ; singer-songwriter , Carlo 's First Christmas , Joy Is Waiting , New York City Managing directors at prominent hanking firms such as Morgan Stanley do n't often look like Carla Harris . At forty-three , Harris is invariably the only black woman in the room when the firm 's biggest deals get done . In 1999 she steered the bonanza $5.5 billion public offering for UPS , which at the time was the largest in U.S. history . Among dozens of honors , she has been named by Fortune magazine as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a drive for education , " says Harris , who grew up an only child in Jacksonville , Florida . Her mother was an assistant dean at a middle school , and her father captained a commercial fishing ship ; both are now retired . " They stressed that you should achieve the highest goals you could and then go above and beyond . " Just what Harris has done . With a partial scholarship , she mostly worked her way through Harvard , graduating magna cum laude in economics . A Wall Street summer internship arranged by Sponsors for Educational Opportunity ( SEO ) , a nonprofit that mentors students of color , put her on the financial-services track . She went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School , with distinguished second-year honors , and has been setting records at Morgan Stanley ever since . Asked if she finds all of these hard-charging accomplishments a wee bit wearying , Harris just laughs : " I have the brains and the energy to do well . I feel like I 'm doing what I was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator and childhood friend , Harris still finds time to speak to young students around the country . " There are n't a lot of women or folks of color doing what I do , so it 's important to show young people an example , " she says . She also uses her expertise to build nonprofits . Harris 's commitments include serving on the boards of the Food Bank for New York City , A Better Chance and SEO , the group that set up her internship . Yet Harris 's drive to excel hardly stops there . After thirteen-hour days on Wall Street , she frequently heads up to Harlem to pursue her second passion : gospel singing . Evenings and weekends , Harris sings with the choir at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church . She 's been billed at the Apollo Theater , Lincoln Center and , last November , Carnegie Hall 's Zankel Hall . She has also funded and coproduced two CDs of her performances , Carlo 's First Christmas and Joy Is Waiting . Like any astute investment banker , Harris has a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alma mater . Bishop Kenny High School , in Jacksonville . " Many African-American parents who send their kids to private Catholic elementary schools ca n't afford high school because the tuition goes up four or five times , " Harris says . So as her singing career gains traction . Harris is lipping the ante on her giving . " If you can change someone 's life by providing access to education , it has a multiplier effect , " she says . Harris recently pledged to raise $500,000 through her singing for two schools : half for Bishop Kenny and half for the school run by St. Charles Borromeo . " Hopefully , I motivate the people I 'm helping , " she says . " This is what you must do . It 's the rent you pay for being here . It 's as necessary as breathing . " The Pioneer MITCHELL S. ROSENTHAL , M.D. Founding president , PHOENIX HOUSE , www.phocnixhuuso.org , New York City Forty years ago , drug addiction was considered hopeless . " The dictum at the time was , once an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who helped reverse that grim life sentence . In 1965 , as a young clinical psychiatrist and navy lieutenant commander , Kosenthal was assigned to the Oakland , California , naval hospital . While there , he met lots of marines and sailors who had become addicted to drugs while in Vietnam . In treating them , Rosenthal noticed that group dynamics made a big difference . " When harnessed in a disciplined way . the peer group was a powerful therapeutic force , " he says . In 1967 , back in New York , where he was raised , Rosenthal began treating six addicts who had moved temporarily into a broken-down apartment-the original Phoenix House . " The methodology came out of what I saw in the military . When several people you live with speak to you about the way you talk to people , your table manners or the fact that you do not help in a situation like cleaning-and these things come up every day-suddenly you start to see yourself and get feedback that you might not ordinarily get , " he explains . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage one another 's recovery , has set a standard for drug rehabilitation around the world , and Phoenix House has become the nation 's leading nonprofit substance-abuse service provider . With a tight $100 million budget , mostly from government contracts , the organization cares for about 6,000 teens and adults every day at nearly 100 programs in nine states . Residents usually spend twelve to eighteen months in a structured setting , where they are treated by mental-health professionals and participate in peer-therapy groups made up of a dozen or so addicted users . The results are unprecedented . Phoenix House reports that three out of every four graduates remain drug-free and that it has directly touched about 150,000 lives since it began . The emphasis is on emotional education . " My training and orientation as a child psychiatrist focuses on the hurt child , and that 's woven into the fabric of Phoenix House , " says Rosenthal .

As he sees it , " people give because of relationships . " At this point , Rosenthal could command any number of public platforms and megaphones , but he 's exactly where he wants to be . " There are so many myths about drug abuse , " he says . " People come to Phoenix House expecting to find some sort of depressing mental institution full of people withdrawing . Instead , you find smart , creative , compassionate people , and once their energies are harnessed to change their lives , they 're just a joy to be with . That 's why I can do this kind of work for all these years . " Sidebar " I 'm in enormous believer in one person 's ability to change the world , " says Anthony Shriver .

" He would certainly be proud of his daughter ( opposite , with a few young fans ) .
