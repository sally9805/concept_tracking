<p> Admit it , guys . You forgot to buy your sweetie a Valentine 's Day present . <p> Fret not . Take her to Daredevil , the most romantic movie opening this weekend . It also stars the sexiest man alive  --  besides you , of course . He even comes in holiday-appropriate gift-wrap : muscle-hugging red leather . <p> Yes , the plot is ripped from the pages of a comic book . But it 's time to come clean about comics-inspired movies , especially those drawn from the Marvel Universe , and expose them for what they really are  --  grandiose soap operas that bubble over with passion and heartache . Who needs pre-fab Hallmark sentiments when an earnest superhero can say it for you ? <p> These hellbent roller-coaster rides , which include this summer 's X-Men 2 ( May 2 ) and The Hulk ( June 20 ) , often detour into the tunnel of love as the action becomes tangled in romance . After all , the signature image in last year 's Spider-Man was n't a showdown with villain Green Goblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , wet one that Tobey Maguire 's costumed Peter Parker laid on Kirsten Dunst 's dish-next-door Mary Jane while provocatively dangling upside-down . <p> The lip smack heard round the world had enough of a ripple effect to attract not just Spider-Man 's young male fan base in record numbers , but also women whose youthful comic-book reading habits probably consisted of the occasional flip through Archie . As a result , the love affair between filmgoers and masked avengers vaulted to new emotional and box-office heights , and Spider-Man grossed an amazing $ 404 million . <p> Spidey 's audience " broke down to about 53% male , 47% female , " says Robert Bucksbaum of box office tracker Reel Source Inc . The lesson learned for other comic spinoffs : " The young adult male is a given . So why not go after the date crowd ? That 's the key to exceeding box office potential . " The film also succeeded in attracting as many ticket buyers above age 25 as under . <p> Laura Ziskin , a producer of Spider-Man and its sequel , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May 2004 , came late to the comic-book party but now proudly proclaims herself " an official geek . " <p> " Many women said to me that they did not think they would like Spider-Man and ended up loving it . As Peter says , it 's ' all about a girl . ' We had to deliver on the love story . That 's the universal element . " <p> Daredevil , which just happens to have its own downpour-drenched smooch , attempts to do the same . Early in the film , blind attorney by day , vigilante by night Matt Murdock uses his other ultra-acute senses to trail the hard-to-impress Elektra , a dazzling practitioner of martial arts . <p> Inside a city playground , she engages the handsome stranger in feverish hand-to-hand foreplay , matching him flip for flip and kick for kick . They smile all the while , panting with pain and pleasure . <p> " Does every guy have to go through this to get your name ? " inquires a breathless Matt , played by the aforementioned sexy title holder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my number , " taunts Elektra , embodied by Jennifer Garner , the spy gal from TV 's Alias . <p> These two just do n't meet cute . They combat cute . " It 's our version of the ' getting-to-know-you ' scene , " Daredevil director/writer Mark Steven Johnson says . " Most movies would have them walk and talk after a dinner date . We have two people fighting on a seesaw . " It 's the start of a beautiful relationship with plenty of emotional ups and downs . <p> The teasing continues in X-Men 2 , the more romance-heavy sequel to 2000 's mutant-warrior hit . " The last movie touched on that Wolverine had a crush on Jean Grey , " says Famke Janssen , who plays the telekinetic brainy babe . Although Jean is engaged to laser-eyed Cyclops , " this one takes it a little further . " In other words , " Wolverine makes a move , animal that he is . " <p> The affection could grow even more intense with The Hulk , the comic world 's answer to Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is action in Ang Lee 's world , " writer/producer James Schamus says of the director who also was behind Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . " Jennifer Connelly 's character , Betty Ross , finds herself in love with somebody she does n't know who or what he is . Her quest to find the truth is also a quest to fully realize her love . " <p> Meanwhile , Aussie hunk Eric Bana , whose scientist Bruce Banner develops a raging alter ego after being exposed to gamma radiation , gets to show his stuff as well . As Schamus notes , " One aspect of Hulking out is that your clothes do n't fit you anymore . " <p> These crime-fighters pack a mean punch , but they also pitch woo with a vengeance . Avi Arad , the chief of Marvel Studios , is n't kidding when he compares the doomed lovers Daredevil and Elektra to a Puccini opera such as Madama Butterfly . <p> " On paper , Elektra is too much for any man , " Arad says . " Too rich , too smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating a rich adventurer with two yachts . Instead , she falls for a storefront lawyer with no interest in money or success . Both know that good things do n't happen for them . " <p> Little wonder Stan Lee , co-creator of the most famous of Marvel 's tormented titans , rivals only Hugh Hefner when it comes to stoking libidinous male fantasies . <p> But unlike the Playboy founder , Lee also is pro-commitment . Notes Arad : " Stan has been married over 50 years , and he and Joan are still on their honeymoon . " <p> Lee did n't pay his dues toiling on pulpy romance comics in the ' 40s and ' 50s for nothing before he imagined the likes of Spider-Man and Daredevil . He invested the same real-life emotions in his often-flawed superheroes who existed not in a made-up Gotham , such as rival D.C. 's Batman , but in the actual world . Who could n't relate to the shy Queens teen behind the Spidey mask ? <p> " I 'm Mr. Emotion , " the 80-year-old Lee admits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you be oblivious to it ? My taste in music is old love songs from shows like Gigi and My Fair Lady . I 'm a sucker . Half of the movie of Spider-Man was romance . I loved it . The best part was the relationship with the girl . I was n't expecting the personal stuff to be so compelling . " <p> Today , when comic books mainly are sold in tucked-away specialty shops that cater to collectors instead of corner grocery stores , the male readership tends to be older teens and twentysomethings , and plots have matured . But for several generations of impressionable lads , comics served as colorful primers on the birds and the bees . <p> That includes Affleck , a longtime Daredevil devotee who would pore through comic books with his childhood pals in Cambridge , Mass. , seeking clues to the mysterious opposite sex . <p> " When you 're 12 or 13 and a boy , comic books are the only way to see how relationships might work between men and women , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours at a time . It was more than just seeing women in scant clothing and these unbelievable bodies . In some comic books like Daredevil , there was a real element of romance . " <p> Of course , a superhero 's approach to courtship is as unique and as defining as his superpowers . Daredevil may be second tier compared with the massively popular Spidey . But while Peter Parker wrestles with his sense of duty and his adolescent desires for Mary Jane , Matt Murdock has no such qualms . Director Johnson says Daredevil is a real devil when it comes to flirting with danger . <p> " He attracts all these sexy women , " he says of the crimson-suited Romeo whose Juliets all too often meet untimely fates . " He always had these great , messed-up relationships . Typhoid Mary . This hot , punk chick Maniac . Ben and I were laughing that Elektra was the first woman we fell in love with . She and Daredevil have the best love story in the comics . " <p> One criticism that gets hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . " Most jarring to me is almost every single woman is a babe , " says X-Men 's Janssen , a former model . " If this is what young boys are going to expect in life , they are going to be hugely disappointed . " <p> Still , male fans see themselves in these masquerading do-gooders . " The genius of Stan Lee is he invested his heroes with human attributes , " says Rob Worley of Web site Comics2Film . " You realize , ' They are like me . I have trouble with girls and my job , too . ' Spider-Man is the ultimate geek success story , and he married a gorgeous model . He gives you hope . " <p> Hey , if a comic-book geek like Affleck can attract a catch like Jennifer Lopez , anything is possible . In fact , Daredevil 's exploits could have given him the courage to propose . <p> Says Johnson : " My wife , Susie , and I got married right out of high school 18 years ago . Ben said he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cut to the end of the movie . Now he 's engaged . " Even Stan Lee could n't concoct a more romantic ending . <p>  --  <p> Contributing : Scott Bowles
