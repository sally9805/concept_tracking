The Dream Thief By Shana Abe Random House Shana Abe Darkfrith , Northern England 1768 In the dream , she was always blind . That 's what would come first , the utter darkness , settling over her like a soft , soft blanket . But it was n't a hopeless or desperate kind of blindness . In fact , it always seemed absolutely normal . Because the dream was never about what she could see , but all about what she could hear . " Lia . " " Yes , " she would answer . It was a man speaking to her in the dream . A man 's voice , one she knew as well as she knew the flow of water over the rocks of her favorite streambed , dark and familiar and smooth . " Lia , " he would say , an imperative . " I 'm here . " " Come to me . " And she would , because in the dream there was nothing she wanted more than to obey that voice . It was her only ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still so smooth . " The peaches are ripening . The wheat is hip-high . The Dartmoor ruby has a buyer in Brussels . He wants the emeralds as well . " " Good . " And , oh , how it pleased her , that one single word . How it shimmered through her like warm , sunlit honey , filling her with sweetness . " Where is the marquess ? " the man asked . " Kimber is in the drawing room , awaiting you . " That part was wrong . Even in the dream Lia knew it was wrong , because Kimberwas n't the Marquess of Langford yet . Their father was . Kimber was just a boy . But the man never noticed . " And tonight , my heart ? " the man asked , his voice stroking . " Tonight is the Havington dinner party . The viscountess will wear sapphires and silk . " She did not know anyone named Havington . She did not know how she knew about the sapphires , or the silk . But she knew that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A necklace of one hundred thirty-two stones , set in gold , the center stone round , twenty-nine carats , with a spray of opals all around . A bracelet of thirty-five stones : twenty sapphires , fifteen opals . An anklet of eleven sapphires , twenty-one opals " " Very good . That 's enough . " In the dream , she expanded with that sweetness once more . " What time will the viscountess be removing her jewelry , Lia ? " " Twelve thirty-seven . Eleven minutes after the last guest leaves . The necklace is heavy , " she added . " And you 're going to have to kill the second footman . He sees you on the way out . " The man said nothing . His presence broke the darkness around her like a prism of pure , humming joy . Like a song . Like a reverie . " Lia . " " Yes ? " " Twelve-thirty is n't late . Wait for me in bed . " " Yes , Zane , " she would always answer . And then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that she was n't ready , even though they had waited the requisite fifteen days and sixteen nights for that one perfect June dusk without sun or moon or even stars . The sky above them was smoke and purple-blue , framed by the black cathedral of oaks and willows that made a rough enclosure around their circle of five . Her face was still visible , pale , elfin-sharp , very clear to him even through the fading light . Lia did n't share the famous beauty of their sisters , Audrey 's regal walk or Joan 's silver-bell laugh . Fourteen years old , both earnest and shy , the essence of Lady Amalia Langford was all contradictions : elbows and a bumpy grace , wheat-gold hair and almond dark eyes , and a face that appeared close to ordinary until she smiled . Even then , she was n't beautiful . She was , he considered , trying to be fair . . . arresting . In fact , despite her powerful bloodlines , Lia did n't look like anyone else in the tribe . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too thin , even as a little girl . He 'd been back from Eton only a few days . Kim would have thought that by now his youngest sister would have grown into her heritage , but to him she still seemed like a changeling stuffed into someone else 's shawl and lacy pink gown . She felt his stare . From her seat on the forest floor her head turned . She met his lookher braids fraying loose from their pins , her cheek smooth with the last glow of twilight , no capthen glanced quickly away . The corners of her lips pulled back into a faint , unhappy line . That was how Kim knew she was n't going to finish the ritual . She returned to watching the pair of wrens in the scrolled metal cage near her feet . They fluttered from bar to bar , breathing in small , impassioned notes . It was the only noise that broke the forest silence . There were no crickets sawing . There were no mice or badgers or moles rummaging through the fallen leaves . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed too hard against the wires . Kim caught the flicker of emotion that crossed Lia 's face , so fleet he doubted any of the others noticed . But he was the eldest . He 'd had the most experience reading hearts . That flicker had been pain , and sympathy . She 'd always longed for a pet . Hell . She 'd be useless tonight after all . Something dark scored the sky above their heads , something serpentine . None of them bothered to look up . The highest fingers of the oaks shivered in its wake . " Daughter of the tribe , " Kim intoned , going on with it anyway . By God , the carriage ride alone back home had taken over a week ; he was n't going to let her off easily . " What dare you offer us ? " But his sister was distracted again . This time her head cocked , her chin lifted , as if she could hear something the others could not . " Lia , " muttered Rhys , the third oldest , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your part . " " I , daughter of the tribe , " said Lia , her chin lowering obediently , " bring unto you . . . bring unto . . . " The wrens flipped back and forth and back in their prison . " . . . this dire offering , " hissed Joan , prompting . " This dire offering . " " What is the offering ? " Kim asked in his gravest voice , because it was ritual , and because he 'd been practicing that voice for some while . Lia lifted her hand to the cage . The birds pressed back against the far side . " Heart and feathers , " she said , but turned her head againand then broke the circle by climbing to her feet . " Li-a , " said Audrey , exasperated . " Does n't anyone hear that ? " " No , " answered Rhys . " And neither do you . Sit down , so we can finish this . It took me a bloody fortnight to catch those wrens . " " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carriage . " " It 's not " Kim began , but then he stopped , because , actually , he heard it too . Not just a carriage , a post chaise , rattling down the graveled drive from the distant manor house . He sent his sister a new , keener glance . " You heard that from here ? It 's at least a mile away . " Audrey had come to her feet as well , brushing out her skirts . " Who 's expected ? " " No one . " Rhys shrugged . " Just Zane , and he 's leaving . " All three sisters swiveled to face him , and in that instant they looked remarkably alike . " What ? " he said , scowling . " Zane ? " echoed Joan . " Zane 's here ? " " Not any longer . Apparently . " " Why did n't you tell us ? " " I beg your pardon . I did n't realize I was employed as your majordomo . " Lia dropped her shawl . It slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curving ghost against the brown leaves and dirt . " Hold up . " Kim caught her arm before her third step . " You ca n't leave . We 've only just begun . " She glanced up at him but it was darker now , so he could n't quite read her face . But he was irritated to have come so far for naught ; he tightened his grip and gave her a shake . " Oh , let her be , " said Joan . " She 's too young for this anyway . We all knew it . " " I did it younger than she , " Kim countered . " Yes , and you had something to prove , did n't you ? " This from Audrey , his twin . " Eldest son , future Alpha of the tribe . You wanted to impress us . " She lifted a shoulder , nonchalant . " Do n't poker up . I would have done the same if I were you . It was clever to think up a ritual . " Rhys sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moment 's gone . They 're right , you know , she 's just too young . She 's always too young . And she has n't shown any of the Gifts , anyway . " Beneath his hand , Lia twitched . But Audrey had reminded him of who he was , and who he was someday going to be , and so Kim said , " You know what this means , Amalia . You wo n't be one of us , truly one of us , until the ritual is complete . Your Gifts wo n't come . Or if they do , they wo n't be as good . " " Yes , " she said flatly . " I know . " She shook free of his grip , turned to the birdcage , and snapped open the door . There came a flurry of peeps and rustling ; when she straightened again , there was a dark lump in her fist . " To the drkon , " Amalia said , and broke the wren 's neck . Her fingers opened . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an angel fan across the tassels . " You have to do both , " managed Rhys , into the sudden hush . Without a word , Lia stuck her hand into the cage and retrieved the other wren . Another rush of invisible wind sliced over them , clattering the leaves . She flung the second bird up after it , where it flapped and fluttered and skimmed off in a drunken line , vanishing into the night . Lia shot a look at Kimber , chin tilted . " I suppose I 'll only ever be half as good as you , after all , " his little sister said , and with her skirts in her hands she pelted down the path that led back to Chasen Manor . Changeling , Kim thought , watching her go . Definitely . *** Once , years ago , Lia had asked her mother if she heard the song . " The supper chime ? " Rue Langford had asked , tucking her daughter into bed . " No , Mama . The other song . The quiet one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father ? " " No . The other song . " And Mama had gazed down at her with her lovely brown eyes , her head tilted , a smile on her lips . She and Papa were hosting a fte that evening for the members of the council and their wives . Her skirts were ivory and cream ; she smelled of flowers and soap and the silvery dust of hair powder . She wore pearls that thrummed with a low , gentle melody , simple , like a hymn . Lia reached out and ran her fingers over the bracelet . " I 'm afraid I do n't know what song you mean , beloved . " " That one . . . " Audrey was already out of the nursery , but Joan was in the bed against the other wall , sulking because she was n't yet old enough to attend the fte . " She says she hears a song all the time , " said Joan in a very bored , grown-up voice . Mama 's look sharpened . " What sort of song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . like the wind in a meadow . Like the ocean . " Rue 's expression relaxed . " Oh . Yes , I hear that sometimes too . " " You do ? " " I do . Nature plays a wonderful symphony for us . " " No , not nature . It 's a song . " Rue placed the back of her fingers upon her daughter 's forehead . Her skin felt very cool . " Can you hum it ? " " No . " " Does it bother you ? Does it hurt your head ? " " No . . . " " It 's not even real , " said Joan loudly in her bored voice . " If it was real , we 'd all hear it . We can hear everything . " " It is real to your sister , " answered Mama , firm , and looked back at Lia . " You must tell me if it ever starts to fret you . Come to me , and I 'll fix it . " Lia sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , the most powerful female of the tribe , but Lia had no idea her mother 's Gifts were that strong . " How , Mama ? " " Why , I 'll love it away , just like this , " said Rue , laughing as she caught Lia by the shoulders and pressed rose-petal kisses all over her cheeks . That was how Amalia knew that her mother did n't believe her either . When the dreams began to surface a few years after that , Lia did n't bother to tell anyone . The song , for all its persistence , held a certain sadness and distance that made it seem almost innocent . But there was nothing of innocence in the blind dreams . In them she was another person . . . older . Enigmatic . She woke from them flushed and panting , guilty and excited and miserable at once . She would n't share those feelings with anyone , not even her mother . At first they were fragments , just voices and sentences that seemed strung together without reason . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sense . She could hear the man 's voice , but it was as though he was far away from her , talking through a rainstorm . She caught only snatches of words . Yet the dreams had grown clearer . And clearer . And with them , a rising sense of danger , a warning that pushed down on her chest and prickled the hair on her arms . Nothing truly terrible ever happened in the blind dreams . At the same time , she knew that somehow they meant everything terrible . She spoke of stealing and killing and the loss of her parents as if reciting a list for the village market . It was not pretend . But in that humming , welcome dark , Lia felt nothing wrong at all . A few months past , in the gray morning hours of her fourteenth birthday , the dream had revealed for the first time who the man was . Zane . Zane the Other , Zane the criminal . Zane , former apprentice of the Smoke Thief herself , now the tribe 's hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world beyond Darkfrith. &lt; Continues ... by Shana Abe Excerpted by permission .
