Graph Not Transcribed Helping kids grow up strong , straight and smart takes more than love . It also takes child care for working parents , recreation for kids and families at all income levels , safe communities , parks and libraries , healthy physical environments , and strong health care and education systems . It takes money  --  both personal income and government spending . Plus it takes a connection to the community . With these ideas in mind , we crunched the numbers on 12 major Canadian cities to see how they measure up . We found that it 's Canada 's tortoises  --  our slow and steady smaller cities  --  that have the best track records for providing what kids and families need most . Our hares  --  the huge , fast-growing cities  --  have n't done nearly as well , even in provinces where child care , education and health care are well funded . BOB GLOSSOP , executive director of programs and research for the Vanier Institute of the Family in Ottawa , says it only makes sense : In smaller cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lower . They also tend to suffer less crime and poverty , and possess a stronger sense of community . So Glossop was n't surprised that Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver , our three largest cities , ended up with the lowest ratings of all those we examined . " The challenge is bigger for any large city to become family-friendly , " he observes . " The preoccupations of those large cities are predominantly commercial . That 's why they 're big cities . That 's what drives them . And those commercial interests are not necessarily what serve families well . " The best cities for families , he adds , are big enough to provide needed services , but small enough that residents feel connected and , therefore , inclined to get involved in their neighbourhoods . That description fits all five of our top-rated cities : Quebec City ( population 670,000 , according to the 1996 census ) , Ottawa-Hull ( just over a million ) , Halifax ( 330,000 ) , Winnipeg ( 670,000 ) and Calgary ( 820,000 ) . Quebec City captured top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provincial government committed to nurturing families , in part through a child care system that  --  if you can get a spot  --  charges just $5 a day , no matter what the family income . " Everything you could want to do is within half an hour , " says Quebec City resident Jennifer Hobbs-Robert  --  from near-wilderness areas to the Old World culture and charm of the city 's Vieux-Port . Hobbs-Robert has lived in half a dozen Canadian cities , but has settled here with her husband , Jean Robert , and their two kids , Marisa , 15 , and Justin , 13 . " We go on the bicycle paths , " she says , " and visit the arboretums and botanical gardens , the summer festival and the medieval festival . " The city has a palpable pride , she says , and little crime compared to Toronto or Montreal . That description also fits Ottawa , where Patti Murphy now lives with her husband , Jeff Adams , and Sam , seven , Joe , five , and new baby Claire . Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but moved to Vancouver to follow a good job for Adams , a high-tech engineer . The couple loved Vancouver , but when baby number two came along , they could n't afford decent housing closer than a couple of hours ' drive from the city . So they returned to Ottawa , settling in a neighbourhood Murphy describes as " 70 or 80 years old with the shops at the end of the street , 15 minutes from the Gatineaus . " Moving east , Laurel Rath says she 's noticed a certain quality everywhere she 's visited in the Maritimes : " People are so friendly , " says the Halifax mother of ten-year-old Ariel and eight-year-old Maris . " In a grocery store queue , you find yourself chatting with total strangers . " The family " spends a lot of time hanging around the waterfront . One of our missions is to find the best fish and chips in Halifax . " Rath and her husband Alain Vezina recently moved here from Rimouski , Quebec . They had done postdoctoral studies here and determined even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return one day . " Nature all around , parks everywhere in the city , and we live on 1.9 acres on a natural lake , " she marvels . David Northcott has an expression for what nurtures families . He calls it " that small-town attitude " and says Winnipeg has it . Northcott runs Winnipeg Harvest , the city 's biggest food bank . " One of the things statistics do n't measure  --  that we 're not very good at measuring  --  is the spirit of families and the spirit of kids . Last year , we had over 220,000 volunteer hours at the food bank . " Of our top five cities , only Calgary racked up more points for community involvement than Winnipeg . There 's something else our top cities share : a stable economy . The experts say this lessens poverty and crime , eases family financial stress with steady jobs that pay decent wages , and makes it easier for a city to provide services . Historically , the top five cities on our list have exhibited relatively slow economic growth , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and population growth . Apparently , the tortoises can beat the hares  --  where it matters most . For a full explanation of our methodology and point system , see " How the Numbers Add Up , " p. 62. 1 QUEBEC CITY ( 552 POINTS ) Graph Not Transcribed The province of Quebec scores high marks for health care , its active Ministere de la Famille et de l'Enfance , and the most progressive child care system in Canada . Quebec City reflects that family focus , with the highest per capita spending on its countless parks , recreation areas , museums , activities and festivals . But this historic city took the winning slot with family economics : the second-lowest child poverty rate for kids under five , the lowest housing costs ( relative to income ) , and the smallest percentage of families in need of core housing ( 10 percent ) . 2 OTTAWA - HULL ( 515 POINTS ) Graph Not Transcribed First , a clarification : We used civic statistics that combined Ottawa and Hull , but provincial numbers for Ontario only , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ontario outperforms all other provinces on health care , with short waiting lists for treatment and fewer childhood injuries , and records the second-best per-child spending on child care ( $238.40 versus Quebec 's $255.77 ) . Ottawa-Hull scores well with plenty of civic attractions and parks , not surprising since the National Capital Region is our political , cultural and historical showcase . Ottawa-Hull also boasts low crime numbers , making it one of our four safest cities . Only Victoria , Quebec City and Halifax have lower child poverty rates  --  Ottawa-Hull tied for fourth spot with Calgary at 25 percent . 3 HALIFAX ( 445 POINTS ) Graph Not Transcribed When graffiti ranks among major crime concerns , you know you 're living in a safe city . That 's one of Halifax 's many strong points : the second-lowest crime rate next to St. John 's . This city has also made the most of its maritime environment , with a multitude of beaches and fishing and sailing opportunities , and has begun addressing a long-standing harbour pollution problem . On land , it shares with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hiking trails , all topped with clean air . Halifax did n't perform quite as strongly in education , chalking up the second-lowest high-school completion rate , or in child care and economic factors , even with one of the lower child poverty rates among our surveyed cities . 4 WINNIPEG ( 427 POINTS ) Graph Not Transcribed This Prairie city tallied the highest positive score of all  --  994 out of 1800 . While not taking top marks in any category , Winnipeg performs solidly all around on the positive measures , scoring above mid-range in environment and community involvement , third-best in per capita charitable donations , and comfortably above mid-point in education and child care . The city also benefited from Manitoba 's third-place rank among the provinces for volunteering . But what would have been a hands-down winning city was down-graded by high poverty and violent youth crime . 5 CALGARY ( 275 POINTS ) Calgarians are giving souls : The United Way raises more money per person in Calgary than in anywhere else in our survey . The city basks in the glow of Alberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less business for its food banks than any city we examined except Saskatoon . Assaults , property crimes and drug offences are less prevalent in Calgary than in most other cities . But Alberta 's health care , despite having the lowest infant mortality rate , was below the middle mark in other respects , as was education . Both shaved points off Calgary 's standing , as did little spending on civic attractions . The Runners-Up 6 ST . JOHN 'S ( 229 POINTS ) Graph Not Transcribed Economic difficulties plague this small maritime city : the lowest spending on libraries and child care , lowest percentage of elementary school kids with Internet access , and the highest food bank usage ( 5.9 percent ) . Yet St. John 's did n't appear to suffer the crime levels usually associated with poverty ; assault , property crime and drug offence rates are the lowest , and youth crime levels are less than half of Winnipeg 's . As well , Newfoundland residents share with Ontario and Quebec the shortest average waits for medical treatment ( less than 12 weeks ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Prairie " scored comfortably in most categories , and had the best record for civic awareness and for spending on libraries . More school kids have Internet access here than anywhere else , and Saskatchewan spent more on education than any other province , has the best high-school completion record , and the lowest rate of food bank use . So why did n't Saskatoon rank higher ? The second-poorest ranking on child poverty ( 31 percent ) , the fourth-worst crime rate , and the poorest in health care  --  including the highest rate of hospital admissions. 8 EDMONTON ( 195 POINTS ) Despite being one of Canada 's wealthiest provinces , Alberta spends less on child care ( $102.02 per child ) than financially challenged Nova Scotia ( $103.19 ) and far less than Quebec . Education and health care numbers fared similarly . Edmonton 's showing was also hampered by relatively low spending on libraries , attractions and parks . Not surprisingly , economic numbers were quite solid here , but they tell an ironic tale : The third-strongest overall showing ( Quebec City and Calgary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty rate . 9 VICTORIA ( 116 POINTS ) Victoria tied for the fourth-best score in child care , and has the second-best ratio of parks to people , next to Vancouver . Seaside walking paths and lush public landscaping give Victoria rich natural beauty , and its downtown has developed a cosmopolitan image . But community spirit is n't as strong here , and poverty 's a bigger problem than in most cities . Housing costs are high as well ; behind Toronto , Victoria and Vancouver rang up the highest shelter-cost-to-income ratio ( 26 percent ) . The Also-Rans 10 TORONTO ( 75 POINTS ) Graph Not Transcribed Crime rates , poor air quality and economics damaged Toronto 's standing . The city did well in health care , with the shortest waiting list for treatment and least number of bone-breaking kids ' accidents . It also scored high in child care , through Ontario 's best-trained caregivers and near-top per-child spending . But dramatic , second-worst Canadian rates in drug offences and Canada 's worst assault rate ( 32,843 per 100,000 population ) garnered " Toronto the Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( gasp ) the worst of any city we studied . Finally , despite being the commerce capital of Canada , Toronto 's housing is beyond the reach of far too many families ; the city registered Canada 's worst level of core housing need for families with kids ( 20 percent ) , and the stiffest shelter-cost-to-income ratio ( 27 percent ) . 11 VANCOUVER ( 67 POINTS ) Plenty of upsides  --  including the lowest hospitalization rate for asthma and the most parkland per person  --  gave Vancouver the top score in the environment category . But the city 's underbelly of crime and poverty did it in . Only Montreal and Toronto scored worse on assault rates , and Vancouver has the worst rate of property crimes ( Montreal is only slightly better ) and drug offences ( Toronto is close ) . Vancouver also suffered the second-worst core housing need ( 19 percent ) and third-highest under-18 child poverty rate ( 26 percent ) . BC has the lowest ratio of university graduates in its population , which did n't help Vancouver 's below mid-range education showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose negative tally outweighed positives , Montreal scored poorly in environment and community . But the city 's second-worst property crime rate , third-worst drug offences rate and troubled economic numbers hurt its ranking the most . Vibrant and cultured for economically advantaged adults , Montreal matches Winnipeg 's under-six child poverty level ( 32 percent ) , and has the worst under-18 child poverty rate in Canada  --  a whopping 27 percent . And although Montreal and Quebec City spend similarly high amounts per capita on civic attractions , Montreal has the smallest number of attractions and parkland , and spends relatively little on its libraries . HOW THE NUMBERS ADD UP WE CHOSE 12 CITIES with the aim of representing all the regions of Canada  --  two in the Maritimes , four in Ontario and Quebec , four in the Prairies and two on the west coast . ( We excluded the North simply because of its small population . ) After much deliberation , we settled on St. John 's , Halifax , Montreal , Quebec City , Ottawa-Hull , Toronto , Winnipeg , Saskatoon , Edmonton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading social policy experts and researchers , we selected several categories and identified the factors most important to families . For example , in the crime category , we did not use homicide statistics ; instead we looked at property crimes , which are more likely to affect ordinary families . We then ranked each city against the others and assigned a score from zero to 100 . For instance , the city with the best air quality scored 100 , the worst garnered zero , a city in mid-range scored 50 . Where there was occasional missing data for a city , we assigned a mid-range score . We learned early in our research that consistent , reliable statistics are hard to come by . In some categories , notably child care and health , only provincial data enabled us to make valid comparisons , so the cities were ranked based on these numbers . Similarly , the quality of a city 's education and health care largely depends on the weight the province attaches to the service . Finally , there are always inexplicable statistical skews or local differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate will certainly have neighbourhoods with almost no crime . CITIES COLLECTED POINTS IN THESE CATEGORIES : ENVIRONMENT : air quality , asthma hospitalization rates , number of civic attractions and parks per 100,000 people , civic spending on attractions . ( 500 points ) COMMUNITY : library materials spending , library circulation per borrower , United Way contributions , participation level in civic awareness activities , participation rate in intensive volunteer commitments . ( 500 points ) EDUCATION ( BY PROVINCE ) : total spending per capita , teacher-pupil ratio , percentage of Internet use in elementary schools , percentage of high-school completion , ratio of university graduates . ( 500 points ) CHILD CARE ( BY PROVINCE ) : spending per child , percentage of daycare centre revenues derived from subsidy , percentage of staff with at least two years ' ECE training . ( 300 points ) POINTS RACKED UP IN NEGATIVE CATEGORIES WERE SUBTRACTED FROM THE CITY 'S TOTAL : ECONOMY : food bank use , child and overall poverty rates , housing costs and families in need of core shelter . ( - 500 points ) CRIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offences , and youths charged with violent crimes . ( - 400 points ) POOR HEALTH CARE : waits for treatment , neonatal/infant mortality , hospitalization rates , and bicycle accident and fracture rates among kids . ( - 500 points ) A PERFECT SCORE WOULD BE 1800 POSITIVE POINTS AND NONE OF 1400 POSSIBLE NEGATIVE POINTS .
