Edge of Fear By Cherry Adair Random House Cherry Adair San Francisco Monday , January 16 15:15:47 " What does it matter what she looks like ? " Caleb Edge said into the phone , hoping like hell the dark , primal lust drumming through his veins did n't bleed into his voice . He frowned absently at his control 's odd question as he shifted the compact sat phone between chin and shoulder , and the binocs left an inch for a better view . A San Francisco street and a shitload of swirling fog separated the two apartment windows . The lights over there were on . The lights here were n't . Desire tightened his body and clogged his throat . His heart , which was normally as steady as a rock , still pounded uncomfortably sixty seconds after he 'd lifted the binoculars to his eyes and taken his first look at her . Bam ! Caleb felt as though someone had punched him in the solar plexus , grabbed his heart , and squeezed . Hard . That 's what Heather Shaw looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his control , Lark Orela . She was like a frigging dog with a bone if she thought her people were n't focused . Unfortunately he was plenty focused . " Earth to Edge ? " " She looks . . . I do n't know . " Classy . Beautiful . " Deluxe , expensive , " he told Lark smoothly . His heart was racing , he assured himself , because his goddamned knee hurt likehell . He leaned a little more of his weight on the shoulder he had propped against the wall . Heather had pushed the sleeves of the soft-looking purple sweater up her creamy forearms while she worked on something at the table . The fabric draped over her tall slender body as if it had been custom-made . Probably had . Heather Shaw had more money than many third-world countries . " Interesting location for her to hide out , " Caleb dragged his gaze from the gentle swell of Miss Shaw 's breasts back to the top of her head . Look up again , honey , let 's see those gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Were her eyes green ? Brown ? Hard to tell from this distance . " About six months , " Lark told him . " Why ? " Reluctantly Caleb shifted the binocs . " Place 's pretty stark . Chair . Bed . Table . Nothing personal that I can see . " " She 's been moving around . " " Yeah . " And not easy to track down , according to Lark . Finding Heather 's father first would 've expedited this op , and made it a lot more interesting , Caleb thought . Unfortunately , Brian Shaw had been missing for the better part of a year . Not surprisingly , he 'd completely obliterated his trail , so he was a little freaking hard to find at the moment . Which left his delectable daughter to the wolves . Caleb figured he 'd been in physical rehab for too damn long if just looking at the tango 's daughter gave him a hard-on . Long , elegant bones . Pale slender fingers . Silky- looking hair that would feel like sunlight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mission . Anywhere . Any damn thing to escape the hospital . This had been the best Lark claimed she could come up with at short notice . Bullshit . Fact was : She did n't think he was ready to go back into the field . This was n't an op . A simple question needed answering . Hell , someone could call it in . But here he was . Because anything was better than being stuck in a rehab center for months on end . Boredom seemed to be a family trait this week . His older brother , Gabriel , had visited him a couple of days ago on his way to Arizona to get intel from some scientist there . He 'd been uncharacteristically cranky and out of sorts . Clearly needing a little action himself . His younger brother , Duncan , was secretly lobbying to become head of the wizard council and was off somewhere , totally focused on his goal . And when Duncan focused he was pretty frigging single-minded . So Caleb did n't even have his brothers to spar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind a kick-ass , sweaty workout with Gabriel and his claymores , or Duncan and his knives -- or both -- right now . Instead he was in San Francisco watching the daughter of the banker to some of the world 's most lethal tangos . Surprisingly , Caleb 's reaction to the woman he 'd been sent to find had been visceral and immediate . He liked women just fine . No , he loved women . But he 'd never had such an instantaneous , energizing , chemical . . . jolt looking at a woman before . Adrenaline junkie that he was , his physical reaction on seeing her -- blood pressure up , libido up , temperature up -- intrigued him . Pheromones were one thing , but he was n't even in sniffing distance of her . His reaction was so immediate , so primitive it shocked the hell out of him . Why her ? Why here ? Why now ? " Okay , then let me ask you an easy question , " Lark said in his ear . Caleb braced himself . Lark was an empath , and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's the leg ? " she asked , throwing him . Yeah . Concentrate on something that made sense . The new knee still hurt . Which annoyed the hell out of him . One of his unique powers was the ability to heal , but the only person 's injuries he could n't fix were his own . Pissed him off no end . Caleb considered his body another tool in his arsenal against tangos . He needed to be in tip-top condition to do his job well , and he worked to keep himself in the peak of physical performance at all times . He was rarely ill , and this knee injury was the first time in his career that he 'd been stuck in the hospital for so long . " One hundred percent A-okay , " he assured Lark . He 'd been pathetically grateful when he 'd gotten the call an hour ago during his hopefully final physical therapy session in San Jose . Hell yeah , he was only an hour from San Francisco , he 'd talk to Shaw 's daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going stir-crazy . He 'd commandeered an apartment across the street , one whose windows looked directly into hers . A typical winter 's day in San Francisco . Damp , misty fog eddied in gossamer ribbons between the tall , narrow buildings in an ever-changing screen that made it difficult to maintain a clear view into Heather 's apartment , even with her lights on . Caleb had seen enough . " Liar , " Lark told him . " Dr. Long just told me you 're still favoring that knee . " " Then why did you ask ? " He 'd had his knee replaced , but there 'd been some nerve and muscle damage . It would heal . Eventually . These things usually did . He had plenty of scars to prove it . Watching Heather Shaw was more interesting than discussing his knee . Which in turn made him bad tempered . Which in turn made him even more antsy to get back to work so he could forget about it . Based on photographs , Shaw 's daughter had changed some during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lark informed him . Lying was the least he 'd do to get back to work . " I have a medical release from the doctor and the therapist . So , quit torturing me , honey . Find me something . Anything . I beg you . This lack of activity has made me a basket case . " " You 're a workaholic , Middle Edge . " " You say that like it 's a bad thing . Come on , Lark , help me out here . Send me to some exotic hellhole to kick some terrorist butt . " " Can you run ? " " Better than most . " No . But he did n't want his control to know that his doctors were right . He was n't fully back up to speed yet . But he 'd get back into shape on the job . " And since when does an Edge need to run ? We show up and take names . " " That may be , but you should still take some downtime until you 're fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want a vacation . I do n't need a vacation . " Lark had a pretty laugh , even if it was mocking . " You sound like a truculent five-year-old . But I agree . You can do your job just fine limping . Your trigger finger 's just fine . Your brain was n't damaged -- much -- by that beating you took . " " Heartless , Lark . I 'm sharp as a tack . " Was she going to send him back in ? Caleb imagined the young woman who was his control . Lark Orela looked like a cross between a biker chick and a Goth rocker . With spiked black-and-fuchsia hair , and half a dozen silver rings in each eyebrow , and one in her nose for God 's sake . But behind that pale face and scary black eye makeup lived the brain of a brilliant tactician . " Tell me what you see . " She 'd circled back to Heather Shaw . This was a " look see . " He wanted to get back to real work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observations , Edge ? " Lark was like a particularly friendly pit bull . Caleb shifted to do a quick scan of Shaw 's one-room apartment . " How the mighty have fallen . Like I said , it 's almost empty . The walls are bare . No pictures . No knickknacks . Nothing whatsoever to personalize her living space . " The covers on the narrow single bed behind her were thrown about haphazardly . Restless night or lover ? His insides clenched at the thought of a lover , and his reaction surprised him . Good thing he would be with Kris-Alice in Germany within the hour . That was one of the benefits of being who he was . What he was . He could teleport with ease . Caleb worked for T-FLAC/psi . T-FLAC was a privately funded counterterrorist organization . Psi was the psychic phenomena offshoot . This was n't a psi op . He 'd been in Silicone Valley undergoing forced physical therapy on his knee -- it had been just a small bullet hole -- when Shaw 's prints had been ID 'd . Since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . Intel they sorely needed if they had a hope in hell of tracking down her father , Brian Shaw . " She live alone ? " " Looks like . " Caleb found downtime redundant . Unlike his laidback younger brother , Duncan , Caleb liked to be on the go all the time . But they 'd insisted . Getting shot in the knee was a pain in his ass . Technically , he was supposed to be off duty for another three weeks . He 'd never been real big on technicalities . All he needed was to be sent on an op now , and he 'd prove to the team and control that he was in top form . And this was n't an op . It was a frigging conversation . And a short one at that . No action to prove he could still outrun , outjump , outshoot the best of them . Right now even watching a woman through binocs beat lying around on a sun-drenched beach somewhere doing nothing . Give him action and he was a happy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ op made him sleep at night like a baby . Watching Heather should have been a step in that direction . But instead his body grew even more coiled and tight . He needed to get a grip . And not -- he thought with a mental thump on the head -- on that perfect body of hers . Still , the mere thought of running his fingers through her honey-colored hair , of allowing his palms to slide over the gentle curve of her hip , was interfering with his assignment . Time to focus . Yeah . That . He finished checking out Heather 's living quarters . The kitchen occupied one corner , an open door led to the bathroom , another door led , he presumed , to the stairwell . The bed and folding table where she now sat were the sum total of her furnishings . The small , sterile accommodations , after living the high life , must really cramp the socialite 's style . She was seated at the table , some sort of small tool in her hand . Prying a stone out of a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold her own jewelry to local jewelers . That 's how she 'd been found . Her fingerprints had been lifted from a jewelry store after a robbery there yesterday . The local cops had run them with all the other prints they 'd found at the scene . Her prints had n't been in their database . They were in T-FLAC 's . Not under the name Hannah Smith , but Heather Shaw . The jewelry store had a current address for her . She 'd filled out some . In the last photograph they 'd had of her -- some high-society thing in Hong Kong a year ago -- she looked almost skeletal . Now she had more meat on her bones . Not that Caleb could see much of her , dressed as she was in jeans and a purple sweater . But her face looked softer , more appealing now . His heart , which had started a peculiar erratic beat when he 'd first set eyes on her , picked up more speed as he took in the creamy curve of her cheek , the silky sweep of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to her was . . . weird . The accelerated pounding was the staccato beat of fear . Or was it excitement ? Or some sort of premonition ? Damn , he did n't know what . Nor did he want to find out . Lark was the one with precognitive powers , not him . But every instinct in him flashed a big neon warning to keep the hell away from Heather Shaw . And in his line of work , Caleb trusted his instincts . They had n't failed him yet . " Earth to Middle Edge ? Humor me , " Lark said smoothly in his ear , snapping him out of his reverie . " Expensive does n't exactly tell me what she looks like . " Touchable . Dangerous . Trouble . " She 's not a blonde anymore . " In all the pictures , Shaw 's daughter was a golden , California blonde with about fifteen pounds of curls . Now the woman 's thick , stick-straight , honey-brown hair hung to her shoulders in a shiny curtain . A nice improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not pretty , Caleb thought , stunning . Appealing as sin . Her even features , and lack of makeup , made her appear younger , more . . . vulnerable , than her publicity shots had done . He did n't believe in tarring the offspring with their parents ' brush , but the delectable Miss Shaw had run in her father 's very fast , very public social circles .
