Deep inside the Pentagon , past hallways that still reek of burned metal , a windowless first-floor conference room has been transformed into a fully operational command center . Color-coded floor plans and organizational charts of key personnel adorn the walls , and teams of sturdy men and women wearing fatigues swing in and out , ready to be deployed . Air Force Lieut . Colonel Steven Vieira oversees the operation , dispatching troops swiftly but carefully . His goal is " 100% contact and saturation . " The enemy is not human but ghostly , flickering here and there on the faces of the nearly 20,000 Pentagon employees who once thought their building was untouchable and now walk by the west wall 's football-field-size hole and its 189 people dead or missing . <P> Before Sept. 11 , the Pentagon did not have a single full-time working psychologist . Today there are almost 100 , working around the clock to make sure anyone who suffers stress , anxiety and depression knows at the very least where to find help . The military has little practice at being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a shield against vulnerability , as a constant reminder of a mission far greater than individual sorrows or insecurities . Since the end of the cold war , old-line soldiers have grumbled that the military 's warrior ethos has been lost . In the 1990s the Navy was ridiculed for giving " blue cards " to basic-training recruits to help them deal with stress . ( When a recruit was beginning to feel a bit blue , he would hand the card to a trainer . ) <P> So Vieira 's teams do their best to look and talk like normal soldiers , not shrinks . They introduce themselves not as therapists but as part of the " critical-incident stress-debriefing team . " Even the Pentagon 's new mental-health wing , located inside the main health clinic , has a generic name : the Life Skills Center . Vieira 's handouts emphasize that getting emotional " is not weakness . " Says Army Major Rick Keller , a psychiatric nurse-practitioner from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington : " We know we ca n't get them with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going door to door , to every room in the building , and by sending out e-mails and posting flyers listing the mental-health resources available . On one day last week , Vieira 's teams met with nearly 500 people  --  some one on one , some in groups . During these meetings , the psychologists hear the same message again and again : " For the first time in our lives , we feel vulnerable . It 's as if our house had been robbed . " <P> But despite the 100% saturation , many at the Pentagon have no desire to undress their feelings . " The line community  --  the trigger pullers  --  these guys handle it differently , " Keller says . " They have a unique ability to compartmentalize . When we approach them , they 'll say , ' Give me your handout . I 'll read it , and I 'll call you if I want to . ' "
