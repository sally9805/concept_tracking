Easy ways to actually get your toddler to listen , without losing your cool // A homework assignment for anyone with a toddler : As you go through the day , count the number of times you say no to your child . If you 're like me ( 15-plus ) , it 's way more often than you 'd prefer . Why are toddlers such magnets for trouble ? " They 're at an inquisitive phasenot to mention newly mobile , " points out Marilyn Gootman , author of The Loving Parents ' Guide to Discipline and a mom of three . The result : Anything those dimpled arms can reach-the CD player , Mom 's lipstick stash-is fair game . Toddlers are also struggling to establish their independence , so they test limits by heading toward forbidden objects and activities . While you need to keep your little rascal safe , too many " no 's " can backfire . " It 's like crying wolf . If you say it too often , children will tune it out , " says Gootman . That means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when they 're about to dart into the street . Since toddlers are expert mimics , you 'll also be dismayed to find that the more you say no , the more they 'll say it back to you . Some will react to flat-out refusals by throwing tantrums , and if you 're constantly telling your kids what not to do , you risk putting a negative spin on the relationship . You ca n't forgo discipline altogether , though . If you do n't establish rules , your kids will be ill-mannered-and no fun to be around . It 'll also chip away at their confidence . " Kids grow up to be more secure if they know someone cares enough to set limits . Otherwise , the world seems scary and chaotic , " says Gootman . To help you get tough-without turning tyrannical-clue in to these reality-tested , " no " - free tactics . Disaster-proof your house . Stash Great Grandma 's vase and the marble chess set . Toddlers like to explore , and they need to be able to get into things . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter was eighteen months , she 'd climb the shelves in the pantry to get to the paper towel rolls . We 'd put them higher and she 'd just climb right up ! Finally , we set them on the floor so she could stack and play with them without hurting herself , " recalls Gwenn O'Keeffe , M.D. , a pediatrician at North Shore Children 's Hospital , in Salem , Massachusetts , and a mother of two . Distract/redirect . Toddlers have an extremely short attention span-so use it to your advantage . It worked like a charm for Betsy Stoeber of South Orange , New Jersey , who could stop almost any unruly behavior by excitedly showing her son , Rarsten , what she calls a " wow-whee ! " item . " I would gasp and say , " Look over there ! " and smile really big and run over to some box with Buzz Lightyear on it or point to it and put it in his hands . That would get the focus away from whatever was causing the disturbance . " Rarsten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think if you yell " No , put that down ! " it just directs that energy into his being upset . If you focus that energy on something else , everyone leaves happy . " In order for this to work , you need to know your child 's temperament-a happy child is less likely to bristle when you direct him away from an activity . If he 's grouchy in the afternoon , schedule potentially troublesome trips-to the mall or the grocery store-for the morning . Substitute . Another simple solution is to replace an unacceptable toy/activity with a similar one . When your 2-year-old reaches for a hammer , gently take it away and guide him toward his toy toolbox . This allows him to continue whacking away without injuring himself . Explain your position . When you 're telling your child what to do , mention why she should listen . Ivor Horn of Alexandria , Virginia , keeps her kids from dangerous objects by telling her 3-year-old daughter , Sydney , and her 15-month-old son , Christian , that it 's " not for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If it 's something that 's going to be dangerous , we say , " That 's going to be an owie , " or if it 's hot , we say , " It 's hot . " They know that hot is not something they want to touch . " Giving explanations makes demands seem reasonable and encourages kids to internalize the rules . If they understand the consequences , they may think twice before doing it again-whether or not you 're watching . Do n't overexplain . Toddlers ca n't grasp such complicated concepts as fairness , so keep solutions simple . If your son snatches his playmate 's prized dump truck , return the toy and hand him a fire engine instead . " If you start talking about sharing , he 'll look at you like you have two heads , " says Dr. O'Keeffe . Say yes ... but . When Ann Lindblad 's three boys were toddlers , the Rutland , Massachusetts , mom said yes to their requests-within reason . " I valued their opinions , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd say , " That sounds like fun . We ca n't today , but let 's plan a backward day on Saturday , ' ' " she recalls . Couch your request in the positive . Tell your child what you want him to do , not what you do n't want him to do . " I was at a party where a two-year-old was shooting water in his mom 's face with a squirt gun . She said no , but he did n't listen , " says Jody Johnston Pawel , author of The Parent 's Toolshop . She could have told him to " squirt the grass and help it grow . " Be a goofball . Your child 's angling to eat a bunch of Oreos ? Instead of saying " No ! That 's not healthy , " try being silly : Laughingly ask him , " Would n't it be great if cookies were as good for you as broccoli ? " He 'll know you heard him , but the limits are clear . Ignore . Sometimes , the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , says his 2-year-old son , Theron , used to bang his head on the floor to get attention . " Saying no encouraged the behavior , " he says . " So once we determined that he was n't doing any physical harm , we ignored it , and he stopped . " Recognize feelings . It 's easier for kids to hear " I know you really wanted the stuffed dog , but you have six already " than a flat-out rejection . They may not be happy , but if they think you understand their disappointment , they 'll have an easier time accepting your decision . Give in-Sometimes . Trying to discipline ( or outwit ) a toddler is exhausting . So give yourself a break-let her have her way on occasion . Who cares if your child wears a Batman costume to the grocery store ? See the humor in it and you 'll both have more fun . 4 strategies for getting your way " No " is best saved for times when your child is in danger-she 's gotten hold of a kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire situations : * Perfect " the look . " often , kids sta re right at you when they 're a bout to do something wrong , as if they 're daring you to stop them . Flashing a warning look ( though not one that 's mean or threatening ) can often register more quickly than words , says Vicki Folds , vice president of education for Tutor Time Learning Systems , in Boca Raton , FL * Develop a " stop " sound- " tsk tsk , " a whistle , " uh uh . " It 's amazing how quickly they 'll add it to their burgeoning vocabulary . * Say " bye-bye " or " night-night " to things you want them to put away : for example , " bye-bye to the glue stick " or " night-night to the tape player . " It can smooth the transition from one activity to another . * Keep them in the loop .
