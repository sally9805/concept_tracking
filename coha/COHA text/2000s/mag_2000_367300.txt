Why do some people succeed , and some not ? The answer may seem obvious . Jim Hightower , the liberal humorist from Texas , said the elder George Bush " was born on third base , and thought he 'd hit a triple . " A funny crack , but captious . Teddy Roosevelt and his brother Elliott were born to the same privilege . Sickly Teddy overcame and gloriously prospered . Elliott , the golden boy ( and father of Eleanor ) , died an alcoholic disgrace at 34 . <P> When you apply the question to entire societies , you enter into a conundrum that may be approached as a sort of cultural-genome project . What is our social and economic DNA ? A fascinating new book , Culture Matters : How Values Shape Human Progress ( Basic Books ; $35 ) , proclaims the secret in its title and , in a series of 22 essays by scholars , journalists and global-business experts , studies the record of societies ' successes and failures in the light of their cultural inheritances and internalized mental models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in international affairs who co-edited the book with Lawrence E. Harrison , begins by wondering why , say , South Korea and Ghana , which had roughly the same GNP in 1960 , went on to such different economic destinies  --  South Korea becoming an industrial giant , Ghana remaining pretty much unchanged . " It seemed to me , " writes Huntington , " that culture had to be a large part of the explanation . South Koreans valued thrift , investment , hard work , education , organization and discipline . Ghanaians had different values . In short , cultures count . " <P> So , of course , do such potent variables as geography ( coastline , access to rivers , ports ) , climate , religious heritage , sponsorship by superpowers and luck . Political explanations ( imperialism , colonialism , racism ) have passed out of fashion , if only because , true or not , they represent a protest without a program , a righteousness ultimately feckless . <P> One of my favorite lines of speculation comes from Harvard historian and economist David Landes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of Argentine savings , for example , or the intense communal focus of the Japanese ) , returns unexpectedly to a conclusion of such radiant common sense that one wants to put him up for the Nobel Prize . His conclusion : optimism pays . <P> " Today , " Landes writes , " we condescend to such verities , dismiss them as platitudes . But why should wisdom be obsolete ? " Dependency cripples . " No empowerment is so effective as self-empowerment . In this world , the optimists have it , not because they are always right , but because they are positive . Even when wrong , they are positive , and that is the way of achievement . " <P> Anyone campaigning for optimism runs the risk of sounding like Ronald Reagan in his fable of the invincibly sunny child who searched for a Christmas pony in the manure pile . A person must have access to optimism  --  not often an available grace in areas of great poverty and disease ( the African AIDS belt , for example ) . And it depends what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to start a flourishing small business is different from an optimist who hopes to blow himself to heaven by driving a car bomb into the Great Satan 's military barracks . <P> Let 's define it as optimism rightly understood  --  not a mindlessness but an enabling faculty . Nothing possesses more kinetic energy in a globalizing world .
