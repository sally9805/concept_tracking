Jada Pinkett Smith is Gloria the Hippo in the upcoming film Madagascar and the singer in her band Wicked Wisdom , which tours this summer . <P> You 're not the first actress I think of to voice a massive amphibious mammal . <P> I just thought Gloria had a great attitude . She 's very loyal . She 's a take-charge kind of a girl . She can handle herself with all the boys . That would describe certain aspects of who I am . <P> How did you feel when a gay student group at Harvard called you " hetero-normative " for saying women can have both a devoted husband and a great career ? <P> That 's what college students are supposed to do , raise questions . <P> You 're in movies and a band , you wrote a book , and your husband Will Smith is always gushing about you . I kind of want to throw something at you . <P> I still have my days of doubt . <P> Bad habits ? <P> I do n't eat very pretty or drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <P> You and Tom Cruise are pals . Is he looking for his own Jada ? <P> Tom is looking for someone to love him as hard as all the love he has inside . Tom knows me very well . I 'd be very shocked if he was looking for his own Jada . Nooooo.
