Which world did you watch last week ? <P> Do you live in the world where President Bush , whose bold wartime leadership has made America safer , survived an ambush from that liberal lion Dan Rather , who tried to swing the race with a bunch of phony documents trashing Bush 's National Guard service , only to have the charges blow up in his face ? <P> Or do you live in the world where Rather , the Tiffany network 's honored heir to Walter Cronkite , spoke truth to power , made a true if perhaps flawed case that Bush shirked his duty more than 30 years ago , and is by implication unfit to serve as Commander in Chief today ? <P> Red Truth holds that Rather has at last taken his place alongside other disgraced liberal icons , who have recklessly disregarded the standards of journalism to try to bring this President down .

" Within hours of the 60 Minutes broadcast Sept. 8 , skeptical bloggers were spitting challenges to the authenticity of the CBS documents on Internet sites like
