Few bicycle companies need to measure the size of an aircraft door when designing a new model . But Montague Corp. , based in Cambridge , Mass. , did exactly that when the Pentagon said it needed a lightweight , foldable bike that special-operations forces could carry as they jumped out of airplanes into enemy territory . In 1999 Montague came up with the Paratrooper , which has a hardened aluminum frame and wheels , and beefy pedals . It weighs only 29 lbs . and can fold in less than a minute to a manageable size ( 3 ft. by 3 ft. by 1 ft . ) . The market for parachutists ' cycles being small , Montague 's sales languished until the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001 . U.S. forces found the bikes ideal for moving quietly and without using scarce fuel . Word spread throughout the world 's tightly knit military community ; Montague has sold several thousand bikes to the military and other government agencies as well as to a number of foreign armies . Civilians should n't despair : they too can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at specialty shops . The only thing missing from the peaceful version : a gun rack .  --  By Sally B. Donnelly
