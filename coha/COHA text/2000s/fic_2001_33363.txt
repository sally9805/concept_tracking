Carnation , Lily , Lily , Rose Dear Mary ( if that is your name ) , I bet you 'll be pretty surprised to hear from me . It really is me , by the way , although I have to confess at the moment that not only can I not seem to keep your name straight in my head , Laura ? Susie ? Odile ? but I seem to have forgotten my own name . I plan to keep trying different combinations : Joe loves Lola , Willy loves Suki , Henry loves you , sweetie , Georgia ? , honeypie , darling . Do any of these seem right to you ? All last week I felt like something was going to happen , a sort of bees and ants feeling . Something was going to happen . I taught my classes and came home and went to bed , all week waiting for the thing that was going to happen , and then on Friday I died . One of the things I seem to have misplaced is how , or maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that we lived together in a house on a hill in a small comfortable city for nine years , that we did n't have kidsexcept once , almostand that you 're a terrible cook , oh my darling , Coraline ? Coralee ? and so was I , and we ate out whenever we could afford to . I taught at a good university , Princeton ? Berkeley ? Notre Dame ? I was a good teacher , and my students liked me . But I ca n't remember the name of the street we lived on , or the author of the last book I read , or your last name which was also my name , or how I died . It 's funny , Sarah ? but the only two names I know for sure are real are Looly Bellows , the girl who beat me up in fourth grade , and your cat 's name . I 'm not going to put your cat 's name down on paperjust yet . We were going to name the baby Beatrice . I just remembered that . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that does n't like me . Did n't like me . Did she come to the funeral ? I 've been here for three days , and I 'm trying to pretend that it 's just a vacation , like when we went to that island in that country . Santorini ? Great Britain ? The one with all the cliffs . The one with the hotel with the bunkbeds , and little squares of pink toilet paper , like handkerchiefs . It had seashells in the window too , did n't it , that were transparent like bottle glass ? They smelled like bleach ? It was a very nice island . No trees . You said that when you died , you hoped heaven would be an island like that . And now I 'm dead , and here I am . This is an island too , I think . There is a beach , and down on the beach is a mailbox where I am going to post this letter . Other than the beach , the mailbox , there is the building in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly pleasant resort hotel with no other guests , no receptionist , no host , no events coordinator , no bellboy . Just me . There is a television set , very old-fashioned , in the hotel lobby . I fiddled the antenna for a long time , but never got a picture . Just static . I tried to make images , people out of the static . It looked like they were waving at me . My room is on the second floor . It has a sea view . All the rooms here have views of the sea . There is a desk in my room , and a good supply of plain , waxy white paper and envelopes in one of the drawers . Laurel ? Maria ? Gertrude ? I have n't gone out of sight of the hotel yet , Lucille ? because I am afraid that it might not be there when I get back . Yours truly , You know who . The dead man lies on his back on the hotel bed , his hands busy and curious , stroking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to him at all . One hand cups his testicles , the other tugs hard at his erect penis . His heels push against the mattress and his eyes are open , and his mouth . He is trying to say someone 's name . Outside , the sky seems much too close , made out of some grey stuff that only grudgingly allows light through . The dead man has noticed that it never gets any lighter or darker , but sometimes the air begins to feel heavier , and then stuff falls out of the sky , fist-sized lumps of whitish-grey doughy matter . It falls until the beach is covered , and immediately begins to dissolve . The dead man was outside , the first time the sky fell . Now he waits inside until the beach is clear again . Sometimes he watches television , although the reception is poor . The sea goes up and back the beach , sucking and curling around the mailbox at high tide . There is something about it that the dead man does n't like much . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cara ? Jasmine ? It smells like wet upholstery , burnt fur . Dear May ? April ? Ianthe ? My room has a bed with thin , limp sheets and an amateurish painting of a woman sitting under a tree . She has nice breasts , but a peculiar expression on her face , for a woman in a painting in a hotel room , even in a hotel like this . She looks disgruntled . I have a bathroom with hot and cold running water , towels , and a mirror . I looked in the mirror for a long time , but I did n't look familiar . It 's the first time I 've ever had a good look at a dead person . I have brown hair , receding at the temples , brown eyes , and good teeth , white , even , and not too large . I have a small mark on my shoulder , Celeste ? where you bit me when we were making love that last time . Did you somehow realize it would be the last time we made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall , angry . I remember your expression now , Eliza ? You glared up at me without blinking and when you came , you said my name , and although I ca n't remember my name , I remember you said it as if you hated me . We had n't made love for a long time . I estimate my height to be about five feet , eleven inches , and although I am not unhandsome , I have an anxious , somewhat fixed expression . This may be due to circumstances . I was wondering if my name was by any chance Roger or Timothy or Charles . When we went on vacation , I remember there was a similar confusion about names , although not ours . We were trying to think of one for her , I mean , for Beatrice . Petrucchia , Solange ? We wrote them all with long pieces of stick on the beach , to see how they looked . We started with the plain names , like Jane and Susan and Laura . We tried practical names like Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We dragged our sticks through the sand and produced entire families of scowling little gifts named Gudrun , Jezebel , Jerusalem , Zedeenya , Zerilla . How about Looly , I said . I knew a girl named Looly Bellows once . Your hair was all snarled around your face , stiff with salt . You had about a zillion freckles . You were laughing so hard you had to prop yourself up with your stick . You said that sounded like a made-up name . Love , You know who . The dead man is trying to act as if he is really here , in this place . He is trying to act in a normal and appropriate fashion . As much as is possible . He is trying to be a good tourist . He has n't been able to fall asleep in the bed , although he has turned the painting to the wall . He is not sure that the bed is a bed . When his eyes are closed , it does n't seem to be a bed . He sleeps on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lies on the floor with nothing over him and pretends that he is n't dead . He pretends that he is in bed with his wife and dreaming . He makes up a nice dream about a party where he has forgotten everyone 's name . He touches himself . Then he gets up and sees that the white stuff that has fallen out of the sky is dissolving on the beach , little clumps of it heaped around the mailbox like foam . Dear Elspeth ? Deborah ? Frederica ? Things are getting worse . I know that if I could just get your name straight , things would get better . I told you that I 'm on an island , but I 'm not sure that I am . I 'm having doubts about my bed and the hotel . I 'm not happy about the sea or the sky , either . The things that have names that I 'm sure of , I 'm not sure they 're those things , if you understand what I 'm saying , Mallory ? I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it , I do . I only think about it because it 's too quiet when I 'm not . Did you know , Alison ? that up in those mountains , the Berkshires ? the altitude gets too high , and then real people , live people forget to breathe also ? There 's a name for when they forget . I forget what the name is . But if the bed is n't a bed , and the beach is n't a beach , then what are they ? When I look at the horizon , there almost seem to be corners . When I lay down , the corners on the bed receded like the horizon . Then there is the problem about the mail . Yesterday I simply slipped the letter into a plain envelope , and slipped the envelope , unaddressed , into the mailbox . This morning the letter was gone and when I stuck my hand inside , and then my arm , the sides of the box were damp and sticky . I inspected the back side and discovered an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to sea . So I really have no idea if you , Pamela ? or , for that matter , if anyone is reading this letter . I tried dragging the mailbox further up the beach . The waves hissed and spit at me , a wave ran across my foot , cold and furry and black , and I gave up . So I will simply have to trust to the local mail system . Hoping you get this soon , You know who . The dead man goes for a walk along the beach . The sea keeps its distance , but the hotel stays close behind him . He notices that the tide retreats when he walks towards it , which is good . He does n't want to get his shoes wet . If he walked out to sea , would it part for him like that guy in the bible ? Onan ? He is wearing his second-best suit , the one he wore for interviews and weddings . He figures it 's either the suit that he died in , or else the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing it ever since he woke up and found himself on the island , disheveled and sweating , his clothing wrinkled as if he had been wearing it for a long time . He takes his suit and his shoes off only when he is in his hotel room . He puts them back on to go outside . He goes for a walk along the beach . His fly is undone . The little waves slap at the dead man . He can see teeth under that water , in the glassy black walls of the larger waves , the waves farther out to sea . He walks a fair distance , stopping frequently to rest . He tires easily . He keeps to the dunes . His shoulders are hunched , his head down . When the sky begins to change , he turns around . The hotel is right behind him . He does n't seem at all surprised to see it there . All the time he has been walking , he has had the feeling that just over the next dune someone is waiting for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the other hand if it were his wife , she 'd be dead too , and if she were dead , he could remember her name . Dear Matilda ? Ivy ? Alicia ? I picture my letters sailing out to you , over those waves with the teeth , little white boats . Dear reader , Beryl ? Fern ? you would like to know how I am so sure these letters are getting to you ? I remember that it always used to annoy you , the way I took things for granted . But I 'm sure you 're reading this in the same way that even though I 'm still walking around and breathing ( when I remember to ) I 'm sure I 'm dead . I think that these letters are getting to you , mangled , sodden but still legible . If they arrived the regular way , you probably would n't believe they were from me , anyway . I remembered a name today , Elvis Presley . He was the singer , right ? Blue shoes , kissy fat lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marilyn Monroe too , white dress blowing up like a sail , Gandhi , Abraham Lincoln , Looly Bellows ( remember ? ) who lived next door to me when we were both eleven . She had migraine headaches all through the school year , which made her mean . Nobody liked her , before , when we did n't know she was sick . We did n't like her after . She broke my nose because I pulled her wig off one day on a dare . They took a tumor out of her head that was the size of a chicken egg but she died anyway . When I pulled her wig off , she did n't cry . She had brittle bits of hair tufting out of her scalp and her face was swollen with fluid like she 'd been stung by bees . She looked so old . She told me that when she was dead she 'd come back and haunt me , and after she died , I pretended that I could see not just herbut whole clusters of fat , pale , hairless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a scary fun game I played with my friends . We called the ghosts loolies , and we made up rules that kept us safe from them . A certain kind of walk , a diet of white foodmarshmallows , white bread rolled into pellets , and plain white rice . When we got tired of the loolies , we killed them off by decorating her grave with the remains of the powdered donuts and Wonderbread our suspicious mothers at last refused to buy for us . Are you decorating my grave , Felicity ? Gay ? Have you forgotten me yet ? Have you gotten another cat yet , another lover ? or are you still in mourning for me ? God , I want you so much , Carnation , Lily ? Lily ? Rose ? It 's the reverse of necrophilia , I supposethe dead man who wants one last fuck with his wife . But you 're not here , and if you were here , would you go to bed with me ? I write you letters with my right hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to do with my left hand , ever since I was fourteen , when I did n't have anything better to do . I seem to recall that when I was fourteen there was n't anything better to do . I think about you , I think about touching you , think that you 're touching me , and I see you naked , and you 're glaring at me , and I 'm about to shout out your name , and then I come and the name on my lips is the name of some dead person , or some totally made-up name . Does it bother you , Linda ? Donna ? Penthesilia ? Do you want to know the worst thing ? Just a minute ago I was grinding into the pillow , bucking and pushing and pretending it was you , Stacy ? under me , oh fuck it felt good , just like when I was alive and when I came I said , " Beatrice . " And I remembered coming to get you in the hospital after the miscarriage . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , neither of us was really sure that we wanted a baby and part of me , sure , was relieved that I was n't going to have to learn how to be a father just yet , but there were still things that I wish I 'd said to you . There were a lot of things I wish I 'd said to you . You know who . The dead man sets out across the interior of the island . At some point after his first expedition , the hotel moved quietly back to its original location , the dead man in his room , looking into the mirror , expression intent , hips tilted against the cool tile . This flesh is dead . It should not rise . It rises . Now the hotel is back beside the mailbox , which is empty when he walks down to check it . The middle of the island is rocky , barren . There are no trees here , the dead man realizes , feeling relieved . He walks for a short distanceless than two miles , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In front of him is a flat expanse of water , sky folded down over the horizon . When the dead man turns around , he can see his hotel , looking forlorn and abandoned . But when he squints , the shadows on the back veranda waver , becoming a crowd of people , all looking back at him . He has his hands inside his pants , he is touching himself . He takes his hands out of his pants . He turns his back on the shadowy porch . He walks along the shore . He ducks down behind a sand dune , and then down a long hill . He is going to circle back . He is going to sneak up on the hotel if he can , although it is hard to sneak up on something that always seems to be trying to sneak up on you . He walks for a while , and what he finds is a ring of glassy stones , far up on the beach , driftwood piled inside the ring , charred and black . The ground is trampled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , waiting and pacing . There is something left in tatters and skin on a spit in the center of the campfire , about the size of a cat . The dead man does n't look too closely at it . He walks around the fire . He sees tracks indicating where the people who stood here , watching a cat roast , went away again . It would be hard to miss the direction they are taking . The people leave together , rushing untidily up the dune , barefoot and heavy , the imprints of the balls of the foot deep , heels hardly touching the sand at all . They are headed back towards the hotel . He follows the footprints , sees the single track of his own footprints , coming down to the fire . Above , in a line parallel to his expedition and to the sea , the crowd has walked this way , although he did not see them . They are walking more carefully now , he pictures them walking more quietly . His footprints end . There is the mailbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hotel itself has left no mark . The other footprints continue towards the hotel , where it stands now , small in the distance . When the dead man gets back to the hotel , the lobby floor is dusted with sand , and the television is on . The reception is slightly improved . But no one is there , although he searches every room . When he stands on the back veranda , staring out over the interior of the island , he imagines he sees a group of people , down beside the far shore , waving at him . The sky begins to fall . Dear Araminta ? Kiki ? Lolita ? Still does n't have the right ring to it , does it ? Sukie ? Ludmilla ? Winifred ? I had that same not-dream about the faculty party again . She was there , only this time you were the one who recognized her , and I was trying to guess her name , who she was . Was she the tall blonde with the nice ass , or the short blonde with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she was smiling all the time ? That one looked like she knew something I wanted to know , but so did you . Is n't that funny ? I never told you who she was , and now I ca n't remember . You probably knew the whole time anyway , even if you did n't think you did . I 'm pretty sure you asked me about that little blond girl , when you were asking . I keep thinking about the way you looked , that first night we slept together . I 'd kissed you properly on the doorstep of your mother 's house , and then , before you went inside , you turned around and looked at me . No one had ever looked at me like that . You did n't need to say anything at all . I waited until your mother turned off all the lights downstairs , and then I climbed over the fence , and up the tree in your backyard , and into your window . You were leaning out of the window , watching me climb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your breasts , I almost fell out of the tree , and then you took off your jeans and your underwear had a day of the week embroidered on it , Holiday ? and then you took off your underwear too . You 'd bleached the hair on your head yellow , and then streaked it with red , but the hair on your pubis was black and soft when I touched it . We lay down on your bed , and when I was inside you , you gave me that look again . It was n't a frown , but it was almost a frown , as if you had expected something different , or else you were trying to get something just right . And then you smiled and sighed and twisted under me . You lifted up smoothly and strongly as if you were going to levitate right off the bed , and I lifted with you as if you were carrying me and I almost got you pregnant for the first time . We never were good about birth control , were we , Eliane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the backyard , right under the elm I 'd just climbed , yelling " Tree ? Tree ? " I thought she must have seen me climb it . I looked out the window and saw her directly beneath me , and she had her hands on her hips , and the first thing I noticed were her breasts , moonlit and plump , pushed up under her dressing gown , fuller than yours and almost as nice . That was pretty strange , realizing that I was the kind of guy who could have fallen in love with someone after not so much time , really , truly , deeply in love , the forever kind , I already knew , and still notice this middle-aged woman 's tits . Your mother 's tits . That was the second thing I learned . The third thing was that she was n't looking back at me . " Tree ? " she yelled one last time , sounding pretty pissed . So , okay , I thought she was crazy . The last thing , the thing I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while to figure that out . I 'm still not sure what I did n't learn , Aina ? Jewel ? Kathleen ? but at least I 'm willing . I mean , I 'm here still , are n't I ? Wish you were here , You know who . At some point , later , the dead man goes down to the mailbox . The water is particularly unwaterlike today . It has a velvety nap to it , like hair . It raises up in almost discernable shapes . It is still afraid of him , but it hates him , hates him , hates him . It never liked him , never " Fraidy cat , fraidy cat , " the dead man taunts the water . When he goes back to the hotel , the loolies are there . They are watching television in the lobby . They are a lot bigger than he remembers . Dear Cindy , Cynthia , Cenfenilla , There are some people here with me now . I 'm not sure if I 'm in their placeif this place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage . Maybe it 's some of one , some of the other . They 're people , or maybe I should say a person I used to know when I was little . I think they 've been watching me for a while , but they 're shy . They do n't talk much . Hard to introduce yourself , when you have forgotten your name . When I saw them , I was astounded . I sat down on the floor of the lobby . My legs were like water . A wave of emotion came over me , so strong I did n't recognize it . It might have been grief . It might have been relief . I think it was recognition . They came and stood around me , looking down . " I know you , " I said . " You 're loolies . " They nodded . Some of them smiled . They are so pale , so fat ! When they smile , their eyes disappear in folds of flesh . But they have tiny soft bare feet , like children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one said . It had a tiny soft voice . Then we talked . Half of what they said made no sense at all . They do n't know how I got here . They do n't remember Looly Bellows . They do n't remember dying . They were afraid of me at first , but also curious . They wanted to know my name . Since I did n't have one , they tried to find a name that fit me . Walter was put forward , then rejected . I was un-Walter-like . Samuel , also Milo , also Rupert . Quite a few of them liked Alphonse , but I felt no particular leaning towards Alphonse . " Tree , " one of the loolies said . Tree never liked me very much . I remember your mother standing under the green leaves that leaned down on bowed branches , dragging the ground like skirts . Oh , it was such a tree ! the most beautiful tree I 'd ever seen . Halfway up the tree , glaring up at me , was a fat black cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You pulled me away . You 'd put a T-shirt on . You stood in the window . " I 'll get him , " you said to the woman beneath the tree . " You go back to bed , mom . Come here , Tree . " Tree walked the branch to the window , the same broad branch that had lifted me up to you . You , Ariadne ? Thomasina ? plucked him off the sill and then closed the window . When you put him down on the bed , he curled up at the foot , purring . But when I woke up , later , dreaming that I was drowning , he was crouched on my face , his belly heavy as silk against my mouth . I always thought Tree was a silly name for a cat . When he got old and slept out in the garden , he still did n't look like a tree . He looked like a cat . He ran out in front of my car , I saw him , you saw me see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscarriage , your husband sleeps with a graduate student , then he runs over your catI was trying to swerve , to not hit him .
