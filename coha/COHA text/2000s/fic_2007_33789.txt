Chapter One Cassandra Devine was not yet thirty , but she was already tired . " Media training , " they called it . She 'd been doing it for years , but it still had the ring of " potty training . " Today 's media trainee was the chief executive officer of a company that administered hospitals , twenty-eight of them throughout the southeastern United States . In the previous year , it had lost $285 million and one-third of its stock market value . During that same period , the client had been paid $3.8 million in salary , plus a $1.4 million " performance bonus . " Corporate Crime Scene , the prime-time investigative television program , was doing an expos and had requested an interview . In her negotiations with the show 's producers , Cass had learned that they had footage of him boarding the company jet ( $35 mil ) wearing a spectacularly loud Hawaiian shirt and clenching a torpedo-shaped-indeed , torpedo-size-cigar in his teeth while hefting a bag of expensively gleaming golf clubs . Unfortunate as it was , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was video of the company 's recent annual " executive retreat " at a Bahamas resort of dubious taste . It showed the client , today 's trainee , along with his fellow executive retreatants-doubtless exhausted after a hard day of budget cutting andcrunching numbers-drinking rum punch dispensed from the breasts of anatomically correct female ice sculptures , to the accompaniment of a steel drum band , a limbo bar , and scantily clad waitresses dressed as-oh dear-mermaids . It would all make for a spirited discussion on the upcoming episode of CCS , especially when juxtaposed against the footage they were also running of patients parked like cars in an L.A. traffic jam in litter-strewn corridors , moaning for attention , some of them duct-taped to the wheelchairs . " So they do n't fall out , " the client explained . Cass took a sip from her seventh or eighth Red Bull of the day and suppressed a sigh , along with the urge to plunge her ballpoint pen into the client 's heart . Assuming he had one . " That last one was a lot better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , with Cass pretending to be the interviewer from the television program . " If you have the energy , I 'd like to do just one more . This time , I 'd like you to concentrate on smiling and looking straight into the camera . Also , could you please not do that sideways thing with your eyes ? It makes you look ... " Like a sleazebag . " It works against the overall tone of you know ... transparency . " The man was as transparent as a bucket of tar . " I really do n't know why we 're even agreeing to the interview . " He sounded peeved , as though he 'd been frivolously talked into attending a performance of The Marriage of Figaro when he 'd much rather be at the office , helping humanity , devising new and more cost-effective methods of duct-taping terminal patients to their wheelchairs so they could be parked in corridors all day . " Terry feels that this is the way to go . In cases like this ... " The client shot her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " glance of defiance . " That is , where the other side has a strong , uh , visual presentation , that it 's best to meet them in the center of the ring , so to speak . We 're looking to project an image of total ... up-frontness . " The client snorted . " That no one is more upset at the " - she glanced at her notes to see what artful term of mendacity they were using at the moment- " ? ' revenue downtick . ' And that you and management are " - she looked down at her notes again , this time just to avoid eye contact- " working around the clock to make the , uh , difficult decisions . " Like where to hold next year 's " executive retreat . " Vegas ? Macao ? Sodom ? The client generously consented to one final practice interview . He left muttering about persecution and complaining of the indignity of having to fly back to Memphis via commercial aircraft . Terry had sternly forbade him the company jet . Tomorrow , the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faux humanity to Memphis 's wretched , an act of conspicuous compassion that would be inconspicuously video-recorded by one of his aides . If Corporate Crime Scene declined to air it , perhaps it might come in handy down the line-say , during sentencing deliberation . Cass sent him off with a DVD of his practice interviews . With any luck , they 'd cause him to jump out his corner office window . Cass wanted to go home to her apartment off Dupont Circle , nuke a frozen macaroni-and-cheese , pour herself a goldfish bowl-size glass of red wine , put on her comfy jammies , get under the covers , and watch reruns of Law &; Order or Desperate Housewives or even the new reality show , Green Card , in which illegal ( but good-looking ) Mexicans had to make it across the U.S. border , past the Border Patrol and minutemen and fifty miles of broiling desert , to the finish line . The winner got sponsorship for a green card and the privilege of digging ditches in some other broiling-or , if he was lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely , she thought , then realized with a pang that she had n't posted anything on her blog since before work that morning . There was an important Senate vote on Social Security scheduled for that day . She had n't even had time to glance at CNN or Google News to see how it had turned out . The light was on in Terry 's office . She entered and collapsed like a suddenly deflated pool toy into a chair facing his desk . Without turning from his computer screen , Terry said , " Let me guess . You had a wonderful , fulfilling day . " He continued to type as he spoke . Terry Tucker had built a successful PR firm , Tucker Strategic Communications , on the premise that those with a debatable claim to humanity will pay through the snout to appear even a little less deplorable . Terry had represented them all , from mink ranchers to toxic waste dumpers , dolphin netters , unzipped politicians , makers of obesity-inducing soft drinks , the odd mobster , and pension fund skimmers . Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now defunct Tobacco Institute . Cass had been with the firm for eight years . Terry had promoted her quickly , given her regular raises , and promoted her to partner . He 'd never once made a pass at her . He treated her like a kid sister or niece . " Jesus , Terry . Where do you find these clients ? In Dante 's Inferno ? " He kept typing . " Huh ? " " The man 's ... I 've seen more sympathetic people on the E ! Channel 's True Hollywood Stories . " Terry 's fingers went on clickety-clicking . " This ' war criminal , ' as you put it , is a client of Tucker Strategic Communications . Someday , if all the crap we learned in Sunday school is correct , he will answer to a higher authority . Higher even than a morally superior twenty-nine-year-old PR chick . In the meantime , our job as strategic communicators is to- " " Yeah , yeah , yeah . I just-could n't we find like maybe just one client who was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well ... yeah . Basically . " Terry stopped typing , leaned back in his leather chair , massaged the bridge of his nose with thumb and forefinger , exhaled pensively . Theatrically , the gesture was just shy of a sigh . " Do you know what I 'm working on right now ? What I was working on , before you came in to do an existential download ? " " Let me guess . Raising money , pro bono , for juvenile diabetes ? " " The only time , young lady , you 'll hear the phrase pro bono around this office is if someone is expressing a favorable opinion of an Irish rock star . No , I was doing talking points . For our Brazilian client . " " The one who wants to relocate the Indian tribe to make room for the gold mine ? " " Uh-hum . Were you aware that in 1913 , this same tribe-I ca n't pronounce the name-killed two Mormon missionaries ? " " Well , in that case , obviously they deserve whatever they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , needs work . Maybe if they fed them to piranhas or something . I 'll massage it . Want to get a pop ? Defaming indigenous people always makes me thirsty . " Ordinarily , Cass loved going out for a drink with Terry . Listening to his war stories about defending the tobacco industry with Nick Naylor . " Ca n't tonight . Got ta go back and blog . " " Got ta go back and blog . " Terry shook his head . " I 'm offering martinis and mentoring . But if you want to go home and blog ... " He looked at Cass with his " kind uncle " expression . " Excuse me for asking , but do you by any chance have a life ? " " It 's important , what I do . " " I did n't say it was n't . " He reached out and typed . Onto the screen came the blog 's home page . Concerned Americans for Social Security Amendment Now , Debt Reduction and Accountability " How many hours did it take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , bit of a mouthful . " " She was a goddess of something . " " Daughter of the king of Troy . She warned that the city would fall to the Greeks . They ignored her . " " And ? What happened ? " " You 're kidding , right ? " " Just educate me . " " Troy fell . It was on the news last night . Cassandra was raped . By Ajax the lesser . " " Is that why they called the other one Ajax the major ? He was n't a rapist . " " Whatever . She was taken back to Greece by Agamemnon-you remember him , right ? - as a concubine . They were both killed by his wife , Clytemnestra . In revenge for his sacrificing her daughter , Electra . " " A heartwarming story . No wonder Greeks look unhappy . " " Cassandra is sort of a metaphor for catastrophe prediction . This is me . It 's what I do . During my downtime . When I 'm not media-training our wonderful clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever you say , ' It 's none of my business , ' I know I 'm in for a five-minute lecture . " " Just listen . Your generation , you 're incapable of listening . It 's from growing up with iPods in your ears . I was going to say , Kid , you 're young , you 're attractive-you 're very attractive . You should be out , you know , getting ... you know ... " " Laid ? Thank you . That 's so nurturing . " " You look so , I do n't know , oppressed . You work your butt off here-by the way , I 'm giving you a bonus for the Japanese whaler account , good work , sales of whale meat in Tokyo are up six percent-and then you go home and stay up all night blogging with people who look like the Unabomber . It 's not healthy . " " Finished ? " " No . Instead of staring at a computer screen all night and railing against the government and shrieking that the sky is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest of your generation . " " Earth to Terry . The sky is falling . You saw about the Bank of Tokyo ? " " No . I 've been working on the Brazilian thing . " " It led the news this morning . For the first time in history , the Bank of Tokyo declined to buy new-issue U.S. Treasury bills . Do you realize what that means ? " " They already have enough of our debt ? " " Precisely . Do you get the significance of that ? The largest single purchaser of U.S. government debt just declined to finance any more of it . As in our debt . Meanwhile , and not coincidentally , the first of your generation have started to retire . You know what they 're calling it ? " " Happy Hour ? " " Boomsday . " " Good word . " " Mountainous debt , a deflating economy , and seventy-seven million people retiring . The perfect economic storm . " Not bad , Cass thought , making a mental note to file it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? Raising taxes-on my generation-to pay for , among other things , a monorail system in Alaska . " Cass realized suddenly that she was standing , leaning forward over his desk , and shouting at him . Terry , meanwhile , was looking up at her with something like alarm . " Sorry , " she said . " I did n't mean to ... Long day . " " Listen , kiddo , " Terry said , " that resort in the Bahamas where our client Albert Schweitzer threw the party with the ice sculptures ... why do n't you go down there and check it out ? We 'll call it research , make Albert pay . Least he could do . Take your time . Stay for a few days . Bring a bathing suit and a tube of tanning oil and a trashy paperback . Take a load off . Get ... you know ... " He waved his hands in the air . " Laid ? " " Whatever . " " You use that word more than I do . It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's useful . It may actually be your generation 's major semantic contribution so far . It 's pure Teflon . " " What 's Teflon ? " " They coat frying pans with it so stuff does n't stick . Spin-off of the space program . Like Tang . " " Tang ? " " Never mind . Look , go home . Go to the Bahamas . Hang an ' Out to Lunch ' on the blog or something . " He was already back to typing by the time she reached the door . On her way out , he shouted , " If you get any brainstorms on how to make my Brazilian Indian tribe look like bloodthirsty savages , e-mail me . " The computer screen was glowing at her in the dark of her apartment . A prior generation would have called it psychedelic ; to hers it was just screen saving . She showered , changed into comfy jammies , ate a peanut-butter PowerBar , and washed it down with Red Bull . She unscrewed the safety cap of her bottle of NoDoz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to sleep until at least four . Unless she popped a Tylenol PM at three . She wondered about the long-term effects of this pharmaceutical roller-coaster ride . Early Alzheimer 's , probably . Or one of those **25;251;TOOLONG heart attacks like Japanese salarymen have . She popped the NoDoz . She could sleep in tomorrow . Terry was n't expecting her in the office . She wanted a cigarette but had given them up ( this morning ) . She chomped down on a piece of Nicorette gum and felt her capillaries surge and tingle . Shock and awe . She flexed her fingers . Showtime . She logged on . There were 573 messages waiting for her . Her Google profile had searched for reports on the Senate vote and auto-sent them to her inbox . She read . They 'd voted in favor of Social Security payroll tax " augmentation . " Jerks . Could n't bring themselves to call it a " tax increase . " She felt her blood heating up . ( Either that or the effects of the pill . ) Soon energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her fingers were playing across the keyboard like Alicia de Larrocha conjuring a Bach partita . She typed : " The buck has been passed to a new generation-ours ! " She stared at it on the screen , fiddled with the font color and point size . It occurred to her that as most of her readers were in their twenties and thirties , they would have no idea it was a steal from John F. Kennedy 's 1961 inaugural speech , " The torch has been passed to a new generation . " Even fewer would know that she 'd grafted it onto Harry Truman 's famous slogan " The buck stops here . " Whatever . Cassandra was starting to get hits from older readers . And the mainstream media were also starting to take notice . The Washington Post had called CASSANDRA " the bulletin board for angry , intelligent Gen-W 's . " Gen-W being short for " generation whatever . " Even one or two advertisers were starting to come in , feigning interest . In a moment of weakness , she 'd posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might bring in a few male viewers . It did . A third of the 573 messages were from men who wanted to have sex with her . She was , as Terry had put it , an attractive girl or , to use the word of her generation , " hot " - naturally blond , with liquid , playful eyes and lips that seemed always poised to bestow a kiss , giving her a look of intelligence in contention with sensuality . She had a figure that , when displayed in a bikini or thong at the resort in the Bahamas , would draw sighs from any passing male . All in all , it was not the package you 'd expect to find sitting in front of a computer screen at three a.m. , wired on over-the-counter speed and railing at the government for-fiscal irresponsibility ? Girl , she thought , get a life . (
