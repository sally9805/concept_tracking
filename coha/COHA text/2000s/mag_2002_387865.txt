WANT TO LIGHTEN UP WITHOUT SACRIFICING WEATHER PROTECTION ? THESE THREE-SEASON TENTS PUT A RELIABLE ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD WHILE TAKING A LOAD OFF YOUR BACK . // When it comes to lightening up , you can count me in-unless saving weight means compromising the quality of my backcountry shelter . I 've seen enough bad weather to know that I want the security and comfort of a reliable tent , preferably one with a spacious interior , good ventilation , and solid protection from the elements . Thanks to the evolution of tent design and materials , my dream shelter-one that 's both lightweight and weatherproof-is becoming reality To see how today 's slimmed-down shelters would fare in demanding backcountry conditions , we gathered four of the lightest twoperson , three-season tents on the market . Five BACKPACKER editors ( Executive Editor Jonathan Dom , Southwest Editor Annette McGivney , Northwest Editor John Harlin , Midwest Editor Jeff Rennicke , and myself ) logged nearly 200 testing nights in conditions ranging from downpours in the Pacific Northwest to steamy summer weather in Arkansas . Our conclusion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pounding wind and rain . No , they 're not mansions , but the best make efficient use of space . As our biggest tester , 6 ' 6 " Jon Dorn , said after sharing one of the tents during a 36-hour snowstorm , " Space is a luxury you can learn to live without . In the future , I 'm much more likely to accept a tight squeeze if there 's substantial weight savings . " More than a pound separates the lightest and heaviest tents . That 's a significant difference , but one that often correlates to weight-boosting factors like vestibule space , venting elements , and living space . We naturally favored the models that deliver the best of all worlds , but you should consider your personal headroom and climate requirements when choosing . The reviews follow in order of overall performance . For direct comparisons of the tents ' prices , specs , and field ratings , see the chart on page 65 . For those interested in lessexpensive options , we also tested two sub$200 , sub-51/2 pound shelters ; see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our evaluations . SIERRA DESIGNS ORION AST FINAL GRADE : 3.8 For a few extra ounces , this sturdy shelter will let you sleep comfortably in any weather . The Orion AST ( $225 ) offers a lot of muscle when it comes to protection , but tips the scales as the heavyweight in the test . As the final score indicates , however , testers still appreciated the Orion 's allweather security . Annette reported the freestanding tent shrugged off wet snow , powerful downcanyon gusts , and nights of nonstop rain in the Grand Canyon , thanks to a taut pitch and a short third pole , which enhanced stability over the two-pole competition . It has more guying options than the other models , which I appreciated on windy nights in Idaho 's Pioneer Mountains . After 5 muggy nights on Arkansas ' Ozark Highlands Trail , Jeff raved about the ventilation-aided by lots of mesh . Rain guards cover each of the single door 's two-way zippers . Ample headroom allowed us to sit up comfortably inside , though the vestibule is small in comparison . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tents we tested , it pops up nearly as quickly as most . The Orion sports Sierra Design 's 11 stash door , " a 360degree zipper that lets you open the door as much as you want and in any direction  --  plus stuff the entire door into 14 nifty wall pocket . To save more than a pound on a traverse of Washington 's Ptarmigan Trail , John carried only the rainfly , poles , and the 10-ounce Fastpack Footprint ( $38 ) instead of the canopy . He said the modified tent weathered a light rain just fine . Contact : Sierra Designs , ( 800 ) 635-0461 ; www. sierradesigns.com . Reader service #112 . THE NORTH FACE SLICKROCK FINAL GRADE : 3.8 This superlight tent is ideal for minimalists who want big views and great ventilation . I discovered the Slickrock 's ( $239 ) finest attribute before hitting the trail for a solo 3day trip in Idaho 's Sawtooth Wilderness : It disappeared inside my pack and added precious little weight . A hybrid of single- and double-wall designs , its rainfly covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid wall comprises the bottom half . This saves ounces , and permits great ventilation when the two waterproof door panels are zipped open to the ground , providing superior air flow in fair weather . Still , I experienced condensation on below-freezing nights when the doors were shut tight . While Annette stayed dry through 4 nights of showers , the partial rainfly coverage opens you up to blasts of wind-driven rain that can sneak in . As Jeff remarked , " The wind shifts too often in the backcountry to just set up a tent into the prevailing winds and hope for the best . " We rated this freestanding tent the easiest to pitch because pole pockets sewn shut at one end of the sleeves mean one person can set it up in a flash . You can sit up at either end , but it 's on the cramped side for big and call folks like Jon . The modified rainfly , which proved a weakness in wild weather , was a boon in mild conditions . It enabled us to enjoy big campsite views from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 800 ) 535-3331 ; www.thenorthface.com . MSR ZOID 2.0 FINAL GRADE : 3.6 A featherweight with two doors and decent ventilation , this tent has everything but elbowroom . It 's the second-lightest tent we tested , yet 12 days of southeastern Alaska rain convinced Jeff that the Zoid = ( $200 ) can handle a drench , ng , thanks to its tight pitch , fill-coverage rainfly , and double vestibules . We loved the twin doors end vestibules , which can be rolled up completely on clear nights for cool breezes and sweeping views of the stars . On the downside , the outer doors allowed some rain inside when opened for going in and out in a storm . This nonfreestanding , hoopstyle tent goes up quickly and holds up well to wind once staked out . Testers had a love/hate relationship when it came to the Zoid 's weight-to-space ratio . Three of us liked the shelter 's trade-off of minimal living quarters for minimal weight and solid weather protection . But you better check the dimensions if you 're anywhere near as tall as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cramped to justify the weight savings . A ceiling vent and mesh canopy aid airflow , although with the rainfly doors closed the tight quarters got predictably clammy . While acknowledging that they can be a source of leaks , Jon wished for hook-and-loop strips for fixing the rainfly to the poles to tension the tent better . Still , if the tent fits , the affordable price , solid construction , and all-around good performance make an attractive combination .

MOUNTAIN HARDWEAR APPROACH This sturdy shelter delivers reliable protection for the weight , but we wanted more for the price . Gale-force winds on the shores of Lake Powell could n't shake the rock-solid Approach ( $315 ) , Annette reported . The two crossing poles settle into side-by-side grommets at the tail , a design both sturdy and efficient for pitching , which I appreciated when setting it up in rain along Idaho 's West Fork Rapid River . A short third pole elevates the foot end for space and ventilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fly kept us dry , with a waterproof zipper over the door and no flap to snag it on . However , we all wished for buckles instead of grommets for fixing fly to tent for greater speed and ease . Testers liked the front and skylight windows , but the good views did n't make up for inadequate space . With a sloped ceiling and close walls , tall testers could n't stretch out and even the shorter among us had little sitting headroom. experienced heavy condensation after a rainy night alone , and again after a cool , dry night with my wife and our baby , when the walls drooped in ; the pitch could be more taut . I cooked in the " just large enough " vestibule , but its zipper opens Over the inner tent , letting rain in , and the entryway requires a limbo dancer 's flexibility . In the end , we concurred with JefFs frank assessment : " A bit pricey for what it delivers . " Though the Approach suffered no damage , the lightweight rainfly did n't inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 800 ) 953-8375 ; www.mountainhardwear.com . Reader service #114 . WHEN LESS IS MORE WE ALSO TESTED TWO LESS EXPENSIVE LIGHTWEIGHTS THAT ARE WORTH CONSIDERING BOTH EARNED OUR CREW 'S THUMBS-UP AS EXCELLENT VALUES AND STRONG THREE-SEASON SHELTERS . REI HALF DOME PLUS 2 $149 * Weight ( mfr. /BP ) : 5 lbs. /5 lbs . 1 oz . Ample space , great weather protection , reasonable weight , and an unbelievable price earned this surprising tent an Editors ' Choice Award . No , $149 is not a typo . We blinked a few times , too , and that was before we saw how well the Half Dome performed in the field . After a surprise tempest in the Tetons forced Jon and John to hole up for 36 hours , John reported , " In 8 inches of overnight snow , as well as wind and dewy cold , the tent was a dry and comfortable sanctum . " With two crossing poles , setup of the freestanding Half Dome is easy , even in the dark . We loved the spacious twin vestibules and tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully extended . The mesh walls , roof vent ( which closes up ) , and double side doors combine to deliver the best ventilation among all the test tents . Hook-and-loop patches on the vestibule doors permit protected venting in all but the foulest weather . The Half Dome is not the lightest or fastest  --  pitching tent , and we found a few holes in the mesh after a summer of hard use . But if you 're willing to trade a few ounces for great performance and price , this is your tent . That 's why we gave it an Editors ' Choice Award ( April 2002 ) .

This value-priced tent delivers dependable protection , comfortable elbowroom , and one of the biggest vestibules in its weight class . After encountering lashing rains in Colorado 's San Juan Mountains and warm desert nights on the shores of Utah 's Lake Powell , Annette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a great value for a relatively light , weatherproof , freestanding tent . The Tao 2 provides just what you need without the frills . " We found this two-pole , freestanding tent simple to erect-John pitched it in the dark and rain one night in Oregon 's Columbia Gorge . Jeff called the interior space " generous-all the floor space is useable and the vestibule is one of the biggest in this weight category . " Added John , " The high ceiling allows two people to sit up without bumping elbows or tempers . " We also liked the airiness of the two big mesh windows , as well as the clear window in the fly . The fly 's small awning/vent allows decent ventilation , though it does n't protrude far enough to keep out rain when the fly 's door is open . We liked the big vestibule , which accommodates two packs , but its low angle makes it a long reach to unzip the door . Still , these are small complaints . Our main concern was the Tao 's extra ounces , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Kelty , ( 800 ) 423-2320 ; www.kelty.com . Reader service #116 .

BEST FOR HARD , FIRM SOIL 3 MSR ULTRALIGHT NEEDLE STAKES:These thin needle stakes , made from 7001-T6 aluminum , are included with the MSR Zoid 2.0 .
