<p> His three-year , three-continent basketball odyssey still lacks a firm destination , and Kene Obi sometimes resembles a man stuck sprinting on a treadmill . No matter how hard he tries , he goes nowhere . <p> In his first nine months in the United States , the 7-foot-2 , 18-year-old Nigerian with NBA dreams has worked exhaustively to assimilate . He has improved his English during a semester at Edison High School in Fairfax County . He bought an iPod and , on teammates ' advice , loaded it with almost the entire discography of rappers Tupac and DMX . <p> Obi 's basketball development has impressed even the coaches who orchestrated it . The center has learned to channel anger into aggressiveness . He 's an improved rebounder and intimidating shot-blocker . On offense , he bellows when he wants the ball , then charges toward the basket . <p> So much progress , and yet the general circumstances of Obi 's life  --  detailed in an article in The Washington Post in January  --  remain essentially the same as when he arrived here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first high school basketball game . He still considers transferring to a handful of Washington area private schools . He still copes with the same uncertainty that has long ruled his life . <p> " I never know what will happen , " Obi said after a summer league game last weekend . " I ca n't do anything , so I just keep waiting and waiting . " <p> Obi 's long journey to Virginia  --  through Senegal , France and Belgium  --  taught him patience , and he tries hard not to dwell on the logistics of his future . He leaves the complicated details of his basketball life in the hands of his closest supporters : Ugo Udezue , a Nigerian-born NBA agent who helped Obi reach the United States ; Melvin Coles , Obi 's guardian and the owner of several American Basketball Association teams ; and Franklin McMillan , Edison 's varsity basketball coach . <p> The Virginia High School League considers Obi ineligible to play for Edison next season because it believes Obi 's foreign transcripts indicate he 's already spent four years taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to appeal that decision with the help of a Richmond lawyer later this summer . They contend Obi actually missed a year of high school because of a " hardship out of his control , " McMillan said . Obi spent most of 2004 and 2005 training with a basketball team in France , and he could not attend classes there because no local school taught in English , Obi said . He will present that argument to the VHSL executive council , probably in August . <p> Until then , Obi 's summer will continue to revolve around basketball . He has furthered his reputation as a tantalizing prospect while playing for Edison 's summer league team ( which does not have to follow VHSL eligibility rules ) and various Amateur Athletic Union programs over the last two months . <p> Obi attracted attention from college and professional scouts because of his prototypical NBA body even before he reached the United States , and he 's continued to sculpt his physique . Weightlifting has defined his chest and biceps . Running has fortified his legs . He now weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October  --  and stays in games for stretches of 10 or 15 minutes before requesting a break . He participates in summer agility drills with the Edison football team , improving his footwork and coordination . <p> His greatest basketball flaw is also his best personal asset . He 's friendly and easygoing , a disposition that coaches have worked hard to change . Obi tends to compliment his opponents easily , sometimes marveling at their dunks in pregame layup drills . He lacks the nastiness necessary to be a fierce defensive stopper , so his own coach now works to provoke him . <p> Before Edison played in a tournament at a team summer camp in late June , McMillan chided and berated Obi for his timidity . Obi , in turn , demanded the ball . He averaged about 12 points , 12 rebounds and 6 blocks during the 10-game tournament . " I realized I was going to have to get him mad every time , " McMillan said . " When he gets mean , nobody can stop him . " <p> Said Coles , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to score a basket in his whole life to be successful . He was built to be a defensive master . Only a few people in the world have his sort of potential . " <p> Coaches and scouts believe Obi possesses attributes unique even amongst 7-footers . He has a soft shooting touch and makes more than 60 percent of his free throws . Tough passes sometimes slip out of his hands , but he 's improved his hand-eye coordination by playing catch with a tennis ball . " I will try anything to get better , " Obi said . <p> One afternoon in June , McMillan walked to his mailbox at Edison and grabbed two letters addressed to Obi , one from Clemson and the other from the University of Connecticut . It had become something of a daily routine for McMillan , managing the recruitment of a player who  --  at that time  --  had never played in an officiated game in the United States . " Everybody wants to know about Obi , " McMillan said , and he 's talked about the Nigerian with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgetown , Old Dominion and Virginia . <p> Even though most elite basketball players visit  --  and sometimes select  --  a college before their senior season , Obi has hardly considered that process . Colleges will continue to pursue Obi even if he never plays in high school , but Obi and his mentors believe a full senior season is crucial in his development . <p> If the VHSL denies his appeal , he may well have to worry about selecting another high school before he considers colleges . He had never watched NCAA basketball until last season , and he still lacks a firm understanding of the college basketball hierarchy . He has played summer league games on Georgetown 's campus and enjoyed it , so that school is his current favorite . <p> When Obi plays for Edison 's summer team , he enjoys the same quasi-celebrity status he earned in school hallways during spring semester . Most people recognize him , and strangers approach him because they are intrigued by his height and his accent . The attention sometimes overwhelms him . He jokes that he has too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obi 's Edison teammates regard him , respectfully , as something of a loner . They enjoy spending time with him at practice  --  he 's funny and goofy , they said  --  but they rarely see him on weekends . Because Obi enrolled at Edison from outside of the district , he lives 20 minutes away from most of his teammates . He has yet to obtain his driver 's license . " He ca n't get over here , so he kind of does his own thing , " Edison rising junior Chad Rogers said . <p> When Edison 's entire team went to camp last month , Obi often napped instead of playing video games with his teammates . Every Edison player shared a room with a teammate except for Obi . His height necessitated two beds , pushed together in a room of his own . <p> Solitude fits Obi , he said , and he rarely feels lonely in Virginia . Since he moved away from his family 's apartment in the Nigerian city of Enugu in 2001 , Obi has never felt so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . It 's a quiet neighborhood , but he 's developed strategies for staving off boredom . <p> He likes to take walks " just to leave the house , " and his favorite destination is a Marshalls less than a mile away . He likes to spend a few hours wandering the aisles and browsing the bargain racks . It 's a good way to pass the time , with only one persistent drawback . <p> He rarely finds anything that fits him .
