HEY , DO N'T I KNOW YOU ? FIRST LOOK <P> Look closely at this picture . It shows something you have never seen before : Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman occupying the same piece of celluloid . Although the two wily veterans were roommates way back in their struggling-actor days , they have never shared the big screen . Runaway Jury , a legal thriller that opens Oct. 17 , will be their first co-starring gig . " Gene 's always had the ability to be extremely , almost criminally , honest and natural in his work , " says Hoffman . Says Hackman : " Dustin takes big chances , a big bite out of something , which I love . " Well , now he does . Probably it was different back when they shared a fridge . <P> JOKERS WILD <P> It used to be that to make it in Hollywood you needed talent , a pretty face and a lot of luck . Now they 'll give you a break on the talent part if you 're willing to videotape yourself getting shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KNOXVILLE , of Jackass infamy , has no fewer than five movies in the works , and he just scored the lead in the upcoming Farrelly brothers ' flick The Ringer , about a guy who pretends to be retarded so he can enter the Special Olympics . If that does n't make you want to give up on Western culture , consider ASHTON KUTCHER , host of the MTV prank show Punk 'd and Knoxville 's heir aberrant . Not only is Kutcher a gossip-page staple thanks to his dalliance with Demi Moore , but he is also morphing into a legitimate thespian ( stop that giggling ! ) . He has half a dozen movies on the way , including The Woods , from Signs auteur M. Night Shyamalan . Rumors even have him starring in a big-screen remake of that other ' 70s show , The Dukes of Hazzard , with Britney Spears mentioned to fill the short-shorts of Daisy Duke . Dude , where 's the General Lee ? <P> FROM RUSSIA WITH SEX <P> Let 's be clear : Carrie Bradshaw , the character played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally different from Candace Bushnell , who wrote the columns on which the show is based . There 's no connection . None . So when Carrie needed a love interest for the show 's final season , someone who could make fans forget about her enigmatic ex Mr. Big , it was just by chance that HBO tapped bedroom-eyed ballet dancer and international superhunk MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV . Never mind that Bushnell is married to Charles Askegard , a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet . It was all sheer coincidence . Or maybe it was those nice dancer 's legs . <P> THEY MET IN THE MOVIES ; WILL THEY MAKE IT LAST ? <P> Ben and Jen got jiggy on the set of Gigli , but will their romance last now that the credits have rolled ? Onscreen passion does n't always make for great marriages . Or great movies ... <P> THE COUPLE Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon <P> THE MOVIE Bull Durham , a baseball comedy so deft it manages to make even Kevin Costner hilarious <P> THE MARRIAGE A home run . Although Robbins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stayed together through 15 years ( and two kids ) and counting <P> THE COUPLE Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman <P> THE MOVIE Days of Thunder . Horrible : it 's like a car crash , except you can look away <P> THE MARRIAGE Mediocre , even by show-biz standards : they split after 11 years <P> THE COUPLE Tom Green and Drew Barrymore
