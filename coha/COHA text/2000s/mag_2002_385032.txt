The trend among MEDIA BARONS lately has been to push the idea that they do n't need control . They 're happy to share . That " ll work . . .. Photograph Redstone , left , and Diller. // AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE from the Hollywood stage late last year , the little-lamented Edgar Bronfman Jr. - outgoing executive vice-chairman of Vivendi Universal-made a statement that helps explain why the industry takes such a dim view of him . He sold the company his grandpa built in 1928 to the French , he said , because " I made a fundamental decision ... to prize value over control . " Nice try . But rare is the mogul who values anything over control ; it 's simply not the nature of the beast . " Nobody wants to leave the table here , " says the head of a rival entertainment company apropos of Bronfman 's remark . " You think Queen Elizabeth will shut the monarchy down and just be a rich old broad in London ? " Call it the mogul imperative . Take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry tell a different story from the ones that the players had hoped to sell to the public and perhaps even to themselves . At Bronfman 's old playground , Vivendi Those who thought Barry Diller was dead have found out that , like Bobby Ewing , he 's alive-and undoubtedly kicking . He who said he would never work for anyone else is now paired with Vivendi Universal chief Jean-Marie Messier , who 's got an ego that looms like the Eiffel Tower . On the question of value , Diller 's up by a few billion , having gotten the French to pay north of $10 billion to buy back the assets that the enterprising Bronfman sold him for $4.1 billion in 1997 . But when it comes to control  --  well , this should be more fun to watch than a World Wrestling Smackdown pitting the Rock against the Rattlesnake . Meanwhile , at AOL Time Warner , retiring chief Gerald Levin would have us believe that he has chosen quality of life over control . His departure raises the question of who will really control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the person of Richard Parsons , the charming new chief executive , or AOL , in the form of Bob Pittman , the hungry chief operating officer who insists he 's thrilled to be number two . They contend that they 're happy to share . But , with few exceptions , that 's not the mogul way . At Viacom , Summer Redstone dismisses the widely held perception that he rues the day he merged his company with CBS and hitched himself to Mel Karmazin . But many in the industry wonder whether Redstone was bested recently when Karmazin took the money-losing UPN away from Redstone 's guy at Paramount and gave it to his own guy at CBS , Les Moonves . Redstone says stories of his rift with Karmazin are " bullshit . " Does that mean he foresees turning over the reins to Karmazin ? " I 'm not going anywhere , " he declares . At seventy-eight , still a mogul through and through . SO FAR , Barry Diller and his new ... associate , Messier , have been very cautious about their union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold back Universal television assets that include the USA cable network and the production company that makes Law Et Order . As part of the bargain , Messier got bragging rights to Diller himself . Diller is hardly infallible-he 's been through a lot of strategies in recent years-but he lays claim to some powerful achievements : pioneering the miniseries at ABC , the fourth network at Fox , and more . Wall Street is greeting him as a savior , not just of the company , but perhaps of the industry itself Aside from the vision thing , there 's hope that he 'll be tough enough to draw the line on costly , profit-gobbling deals . Meanwhile , executives at the studio-which has been red-hot with hits like Erin Brockovich , The Mummy Returns , and The Fast and the Furious-are scared senseless and joking that they 'll keep rubber bands on their desks , since Diller likes to play with them and that might keep his hands off their windpipes . Certainly Diller stirs strong emotion . It 's almost as though Satan and the Messiah had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications , you did n't catch Messier putting him in a position to seize the wheel . Instead , Diller is running the studio with no contract , for no pay . These two seem to have worked out a strong prenuptial for a pair that are n't legally hitched . Since Messier and Diller are both driven by the mogul imperative , there is much skepticism about how they 'll get along . The industry is also waiting to see how things go with the popular Universal president , Ron Meyer , and his studio chief , Stacey Snider . Up until now , Universal has been a relatively pleasant place to work , and Meyer set the tone . A high school dropout and former marine , Meyer spent many years as a top agent but never acquired a veneer of sophistication in the manner of Diller ( who went to the William Morris mail room instead of college ) . He was a casual dresser , a sharp pool player , and a devoted ladies ' manin other words , the anti-Diller . One thing Meyer has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured out in a great way , early on , who he was and what he 's good at , " says a former colleague at Creative Artists Agency . " The returning of the phone calls . The Saturday- and Sunday-night screenings at his house . " While Michael Eisner and other moguls in suits lunched on a recent afternoon at the restaurant Michael 's in Manhattan , this agent says , " There was Ronnie in his flannel shirt and his blue jeans and his socks and sandals . " Meyer did acquire some mogul trappings , though . He built himself a multimillion-dollar Charles Gwathmey  --  designed dream house in Malibu-white , modern , and immaculate . His Julian Schnabel hangs in the foyer . Still , when Entertainment Weekly named him the most powerful executive in Hollywood lastyear , he was so emphatically embarrassed that DreamWorks principal Jeffrey Katzenberg told him he was overdoing his shtick . But Meyer 's shtick has worked awfully well . When Bronfman sold Universal to Vivendi , Meyer made an apparently seamless transition . " Ronnie is whoever 's agent he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he 's Messier 's agent . " Presumably , he will be Diller 's agent , too . But Diller is a difficult client , and Meyer 's seemingly happy-go-lucky attitude might not play that well with him . " Ronnie 's represented many difficult clients , " says the head of an entertainment company . " Do n't think he is n't going to understand how to handle Barry . " Others are n't so sure Diller can be // handled . " I do n't think he 'll kill him right away , " muses a leading producer . " He 's going to punish Ronnie for the house first . " Meyer will have help . Powerful allies-including Katzenberg , who was Diller 's assistant many years ago-will make it clear that they like having him around . And he has another factor that is perversely in his favor . Coming off a red-hot year , the studio has no place to go but downhill . " Next year , we do n't have a Jurassic Park sequel , a Mummy sequel , an American Pie sequel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Diller has every reason to keep his distance for now . " Barry knows you do n't get too close to a movie company , " says a top Universal executive . " We 've had too good a streak ... and it wo n't be like this next year . " So Diller has every incentive to focus elsewhere . But is that his nature ? He 's been a mogul-in-waiting trying to cobble together an empire for years now . For that reason , many expect him to make his presence felt . But the one they worry about most is not Meyer . If Meyer does n't fare well with Diller , they say , he 'll retreat-far richer and more successful than even he expected to be . " Ronnie 's already won , " says a leading agent . But studio head Stacey Snider still has plenty of career ahead of her . " She has her weaknesses that he will grind into , " says an executive close to the situation . " She wants everybody to like her and get along . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting that Diller loves to engender . But maybe , this executive muses fancifully , Diller will prove to have mellowed since his marriage to Diane Von Furstenberg . " If I were Stacey , " the executive says , " I would immediately start buying those wrap dresses to wear every day to work . " UNTIL DILLER roared back , the industry had been suffering from a severe shortage of outsized mogul personalities . That 's why it was so sad when Gerald Levin squeezed Ted Turner out of Time Warner two years ago . Turner gave the company a little sex appeal . But he made a bad marriage when he sold his company in 1996 , as he acknowledged in a November speech . " Jerry thought he bought me ; I thought I bought them , " Turner lamented . " I guess I got a little overconfident . " Turner apparently likes to think that his recriminations helped nudge Levin out the door . That 's fanciful , but it would still be interesting to ask Turner what he thought when the born-again Levin told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " passionate , philosophical , moralistic purpose . " After all , Turner is the longstanding environmentalist , not to mention the one who committed $1 billion to the United Nations-a passionate gesture if ever there was one . Levin has always played a double game , presenting himself as a guy who set out to be a rabbi but accidentally became a corporate hit man . It was n't so easy to believe when Levin told CNN , " There is a real human being locked inside here , and , you know , I want the poetry back in my life . " He made more sense-perhaps inadvertently-when he told another interviewer , " I am not all that I appear . " New CEO Richard Parsons is the perfect Levin antidote . As he ascended to his new job , he all but broke into a rendition of " Kumbaya . " " I love Ted , " he told the trade publication Electronic Media , marveling at Turner 's insight into the television business . Then Parsons extended Turner 's contract . As for AOL chairman Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . All indicators suggest that Parsons is a man not entirely driven by the mogul imperative . The audience is supposed to believe that his ascent represents the triumph of Levin 's old guard , but the head of a rival entertainment company says there 's another interpretation : " It 's an AOL sandwich-Case on top , Pittman underneath , and Parsons is the baloney . " This is how Hollywood talks about people with nice manners . But this triple-decker could make good eating for everyone . Levin creates the impression that he won . Parsons gets a great job , presents a face beloved by Wall Street and the press , and-as a connected Republican-sells the company 's plan for world domination in Washington . As for Pittman , he gets a lot of power , and eventually , who knows ? At forty-eight , he can afford to be patient . So maybe it 'll work-at least so long as no one has to be sacrificed because of fading corporate fortunes . If they stay focused , Parsons and Pittman could even be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started their run at Disney in 1984 . AS FOR THE WWF ... few would argue that Viacom 's decision to shift control of UPN was anything but a rational move : UPN has lost buckets of money . But this is n't about what makes sense , after all . It 's about the mogul imperative . In December , Karmazin took UPN from Jon Dolgen , the head of Paramount 's film and television studios , and gave it to CBS Entertainment chief Les Moonves . Moonves is a hungry fellow who seems to have had a longtime craving for UPN . But the timing was awkward . The network has improved with the acquisition of wrestling and Buffy the Vampire Slayer . And only a few weeks earlier , Redstone had told the Los Angeles Times that Dolgen and his top TV executive , Kerry McCluggage , were doing " a great job " and that it would n't do to hurt their feelings by taking away UPN . Having lost UPN , McCluggage promptly quit-a development that suited Moonves fine . But did it suit Redstone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the UPN switch and railed about Karmazin 's gall . Redstone is even said to have expressed an intention to fire him . Dumping Karmazin would n't be an easy sell ; Wall Street loves him , and analysts had already celebrated the UPN move as long overdue . Redstone insists the story is bogus . " First , the idea that I would fire him is absurd , because I do n't have the power to , " he says . " Second , I would never do it even if I could . " It 's true that Redstone does n't have the power to rid himself of Karmazin now . When Viacom acquired CBS , Karmazin cut a deal that made him bulletproof until 2003 . Karmazin 's job status can not change without the approval of a supermajority of the board-that is , without the support of fourteen of the eighteen board members . Since half the board comes from the CBS side of the marriage , it 's unclear whether Redstone could even get a simple majority . As for McCluggage , Redstone acknowledges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt badly for him , " he insists . " He 's been a great executive . But I did say , Kerry , I can not argue with the decision . ' ' " It 's possible that Redstone never raged to McCluggage or that he did so only out of politeness . But even if he approved the UPN switch , it 's safe to say that he and Karmazin have different styles . For instance , there 's the matter of the lavish holiday party that Viacom used to throw for employees and their spouses . " Last year , Mel eliminated that because he was trying to save money , " Redstone says . " He at least had a legitimate reason in his mind . We had a party , but it was n't as it used to be . " So this past December , Redstone paid for his own bash . Tony Bennett sang , and Redstone says he took particular pleasure in bringing together the old Viacom guard with the CBS side of the family . " Jon Dolgen and Les Moonves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I saw no sign of anything but friendship . What 's in their minds ? ... I ca n't tell you .... All I can tell you is I saw no sign of friction between them . " As for Karmazin , he stopped by for drinks but did n't stay for dinner . Whether that foreshadows the next act at Viacom remains to be seen . But the mogul imperative dictates that Redstone will be patient and stay healthy-at least until 2003 . <p>
