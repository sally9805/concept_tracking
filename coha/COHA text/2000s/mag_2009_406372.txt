The digital revolution has changed the way we communicate , work and see the world . In his new book , Grown Up Digital , Toronto media consultant Don Tapscott - whom Al Gore describes as " one of the world 's leading cyber gurus " - argues that technology has also changed the very nature of family . Laura Bickle spoke to Tapscott about parenting in the digital age . You classify those born between 1977 and 1997 as the Net Generation . What does that mean ? They are the first generation to be surrounded by digital media from birth . They have grown up totally immersed in an interactive , hyperstimulating digital environment . Using the Internet is second nature to them . They are causing a Generation Lap - they are lapping their parents on the information track . I was an authority on model trains when I was 11 . Today the 11-year-old is an authority on the digital revolution and it 's changing every institution in society . What do you see as the misconceptions about the Net Generation ? People argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Net addicted ; they 're glued to the screen ; they 're losing their social skills ; they 're overcoddled ; and they 'll make lousy employees . None of this is actually supported by data . I think it 's just a question of fearing what we do n't understand . When I give speeches - these are business audiences typically - at the end of my talk , people come up to me and I would say two-thirds of them do n't want to talk about any technology 's role in business . They come up to me and they say , " Thank you . You 've helped me understand my kid better . " Around the world , this generation is flooding into the workplace , marketplace and every niche of society . They are bringing with them their demographic muscle , media smarts , purchasing power and new models of collaborating and parenting , entrepreneurship and political power . They have strong values and care deeply about our planet . In many countries , including the United States , volunteering by young people is at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this civic involvement morphing into political involvement ; witness the critical role the Net Generation played in the election of US President Barack Obama . So how are they different from previous generations ? Take multi-tasking . Parents have said to me : " How can my kid be doing homework , while he 's also listening to M files , he 's texting on his phone , he 's got three windows open on the computer - one of them Facebook and he 's petting the dog ? How is this possible ? " Well , it turns out they have different brains . There 's a critical period of brain development called adolescence , ages eight to 18 . These kids grow up interacting and collaborating , thinking and organizing , scrutinizing , having to remember things , managing information . And that affects the actual wiring , synaptic connections and structure of kids ' brains . So they have better switching abilities and better working active memory . If I 'm doing several things at once , I ca n't keep track of what the heck is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation that thinks , works and learns very differently . What are the challenges of parenting the Net Generation ? Parenting matters more than ever . It 's way more complicated and it requires a new kind of sophistication . The first thing you , as a parent , need to do is use this technology . Sit down with your kids and say , " Hey , this Facebook thing . Show me . " Rather than viewing the Internet as a source of mistrust and conflict in the family , why not view it as a wonderful medium of communication that can build trust and open things up ? For instance , my kids , now 23 and 25 , are a huge source of knowledge and insight . Every day I get some kind of communication from one of them about something I might want to look into . And I try to give them whatever wisdom I 've got that only experience can tell you . So they got me onto Facebook , but I forced them to make sure their privacy settings were effective because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to protect your personal information . Rather than having some big generational divide , there is a wonderful opportunity here . That 's why I call it an open family . How does an open family work ? You sit down as a family and you decide : What are the values on which we are going to run this family ? How is the family going to operate ? You design your family . And then when you have choices , like what do we do with blocking software , you apply these values and principles to the choices you make . And you make deals with one another . So we made a deal with our children . It was a social contract and they had to sign it . There were safety rules - they could never meet someone in person whom they had met on the Internet without first talking to us , and having us there at their first meeting . They could not go to inappropriate places on the Internet . And , in exchange , we would not spy on them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had another contract for how they would behave with their friends at our cabin on the lake . It included a no-tolerance policy on drug use , no swimming after dark , and all teenage guests doing their share of chores . We trusted one another , and we all kept up our side of the bargain . Of course , as in any family , there were problems and breakdowns . But we worked hard to build that trust by making sure information flowed freely in our home . Are filters and blocking software effective ways to keep kids safe on the Internet ? Here 's the effect of trying to put blocking software on the computer of a 13-year-old boy . First of all , it 's stupid because he can hack it . Secondly , it says , " I do n't trust you . " Third , you are denied or can avoid an opportunity to talk about something important with your kid , whether it 's porn and its role in society , or cyberbullying . Fourth , it 's illusory because the computer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to on any given day . There 's also the one in his pocket , the one in his friend 's home , the one at the community centre and the one at the school . In my family , I sat down with my son , Alex , and I said , " Listen , pornography is not a good thing . It 's an industry , it exploits women , it hurts people and , for that matter , it teaches unhelpful attitudes about sex . Sex is best with someone you really care about ; you 're going to fall in love and you 're going to have sex with somebody , and it will be a totally amazing thing . And do n't let an industry mess that up . " We had a conversation where I gave my views in a full and firm way . He said he agreed with my views , and that was that . The reality is that we ca n't screen out the world from our children . The only way to protect them is for them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
