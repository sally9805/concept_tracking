In an excerpt from her new book , The Opposite of Fate , Amy Tan reflects on her embattled relationship with her mom-and how time and loss finally drew them closer // When I was in my 20s , at a time when my mother and I were not getting along that well , she asked me , in her Shanghai-inflected English , " If I die , what you remember ? " Here we go , I thought , the old Chinese-torture routine . I answered something like : " Come on , you 're not going to die . " She persisted , " What you remember ? " I struggled to come up with an answer . " You know , all kinds of things . Like , well , you know , you 're my mother . " And then my mother said , in a voice both sad and angry : " I think you know little percent of me . " Those words came back to me a few years later when , during a vacation in Hawaii , I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an apparent heart attack . As I waited to be connected to the hospital , I made a vow to God and whoever was listening , " If my mother lives , I will get to know her . I will ask her about her past , and this time I 'll actually listen to what she has to say . I 'll even take her to China , and , yes , I 'll write stories about her .... " All at once , I heard my mother 's voice . " Amy-ah ? " " Oh ... Mom ? Are you OK ? " " Yes , fine , fine . Where you ? " " Hawaii . " " Hawai-hee ? When you go Hawai-hee ? " " Listen . I thought you had a heart attack- " My mother cut me off with a huff . " Heart attack . No , no , no , no . I go to fish market , and the fishmonger he try cheating me . Make me so mad . All sudden got a pain in my chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital . Turn out I have angina , cause by stress ! So you see , that fishmonger , he wrong . Stress me out .... " I let out an audible sigh . Then she asked , " You worry ? That 's why call ? Yes ? Ha , ha ! You worry for me ! " She was enormously pleased . So there I was , in a phone booth at a shopping center in Hawaii , crying and laughing at the same time . After I hung up , I heard a voice saying , " Hey , do n't forget now . You promised .... " So I did take my mother to China . I endured three weeks of being with her 24 hours a day . Three weeks of her giving me her expert advice , criticizing my clothes , my eating habits , the bad bargains I made at the market . I hated it and I loved it . And when I returned home , I began to write stories about her life . I began to see how much my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her regrets , all of the mistakes she vowed never to repeat . What I know about myself is related to what I know about her , including her secrets , or in some cases fragments of them . I found the pieces both by deliberate effort and by accident , and with each discovery I had to reconfigure the growing whole . FOUR YEARS AFTER OUR TRIP TO BEIJING , IN 1995 , MY mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease . She was several months shy of her 80th birthday . The plaques on her brain had likely started to accumulate years before . But we never would have recognized the signs . " Language difficulties , " " gets into arguments , " " poor judgment " - those were traits my mother had shown her entire life . How could we distinguish between a chronically difficult personality and a demented one ? She had always been tiny . When she came to the United States from China in 1949 , my mother recorded that she was five feet tall , stretching the truth by at least two inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five feet three and three quarter inches . Although my brother John and I quickly grew bigger than our mother , she 'd never seemed fragile to us-that is , not until she began to lose her mind . I began to look back on those times when I might have seen the clues . I recalled an evening when we had all gathered at the home of family friends to watch a televised interview of my mother , which had been taped earlier that day . The subject was the opening of the movie The Joy Luck Club , based on my novel . The interviewer wondered whether watching the film had been difficult for her given how much of it was true to her life : " Did you cry like everyone else in the audience ? " Her words were rendered into better English through subtitles . The son of family friends called out to her , " Hey , Auntie Daisy , why are they translating what you 're saying ? Do n't they know you 're speaking English ? " He had the misfortune of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livid . Forever after , she would speak about this young man , whom she had always treated like a dear nephew , with only the bitterest of criticisms . Now I wondered : Was her grudge toward him a sign that she was already ill ? Yet my mother had always borne grudges . She never forgot a wrong , even an accidental one , but especially not an arrogant one . If we , her children , did anything to suggest we were not 100 percent in her camp , if we tired of listening and suggested with weariness-or rather , genuine concern-that she try to " calm down for your own sake , " she would become even more furious . " Not my sake , " she 'd retort , " your sake . " Her face stiffened , her jaw quivered as she shouted and punched herself . Who cared what happened to her ? Nobody ! Her life was nothing . She was worthless . Anger inevitably blended with anguish and with the helpless sorrow she had felt years earlier , when she lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later my father , both of them succumbing to brain tumors . This double tragedy was so horrific that the neurosurgeon himself , in trying to soothe my mother as she poured out endless questions of why and how can this be , simply said : " Mrs. Tan , it 's just bad luck , I 'm afraid . " That official pronouncement of bad luck then set my mother into a protracted search for the reason we were cursed . Were the rest of us doomed as well because of this bad luck ? She believed so . Thereafter , my brother John and I , both in our teens , learned to hide our headaches and to curb ourselves from saying we were " tired . " Tiredness had been Peter 's earliest symptom that something was wrong . After my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's , I , too , was obsessed with wanting to know why . When did the disease begin ? When had her logic become even more impaired than usual ? It was important to know exactly when , for in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her tirades that had inconvenienced and pained us , her family , could now be viewed as illness and thus with a more sympathetic eye . I recalled a Thanksgiving at her house when my husband , Lou , and I had arrived late . It was my fault . I have always had a propensity for running behind schedule . " Why so late ? " my mother said when I stepped in the door . She took my tardiness as a personal insult , a sign of disrespect , tantamount to saying I did not think she was worth the time of day . She was sitting in her dining room , refusing to speak . This was the deadly silence we had known all our lives . The dark clouds were practically visible above her steaming head . Static was in the air we breathed . We told her to calm down-big mistake-and her silence exploded into threats to kill herself . There would be no Thanksgiving that year . My brother John and I had heard similar threats all our lives . My mother 's usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating dinner in a restaurant , and she was obsessing about a family member whom she believed did not respect her . Lou , John , and I did n't exactly disagree with her ; the trouble was , we did n't wholeheartedly agree . Her anger mounted until she leaped up from the table and ran out of the crowded restaurant with us chasing after her . Just as she dashed into a busy six-lane street , screaming that she wanted to die , my husband grabbed her , threw her over his shoulder , and carried her , kicking and sobbing , back to safety . My brother and I commiserated in anger and frustration over the fact that our mother could still make us feel manipulated , guilty , and fearful . It was n't until I was in my 30s that I learned that my mother , at age nine , had seen her own mother kill herself . I felt sorry for that nine-year-old child . I could now see that in many respects my mother had remained stuck at that age of her abandonment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year attempt suicide , and 300,000 succeed . And , in contrast to any other country , more women than men in China kill themselves . I pondered this . Life in China today may not be egalitarian , but is it really so bad that women are willing to down a bottle of rat poison ? China as a society is loath to make shameful events public , so the real number is probably much higher . I found this all strangely comforting . In Western terms , we were a dysfunctional family . From a Chinese perspective , however , my mother 's urge to kill herself was understandable . It was part of a larger legacy passed from generation to generation , grandmother to mother to daughter . In lieu of the family silver , what was inherited was a suffering silence followed by sudden implosion , an urge to blot out all memory of existence . My mother had always bragged about her memory . She never forgot anything . It was n't that she remembered just dates or facts and figures . When she remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was as though she had boarded a time machine and been transported to the moment she was remembering . But , as she grew older , she seemed to forget how to finish things . There were half-knit sweaters . Bills she opened but had not paid . Food she had defrosted but had not cooked . Her apartment was becoming untidy , not just cluttered but dirty . She forgot to lock her door and the security elevator . She forgot how to go in reverse and dented her car backing out of her garage . She later bashed it again , running into the back of a truck . And even stranger , she did n't seem that concerned that her car was full of dings . I also noticed that my once fastidious mother was looking disheveled . Sometime later , our family was gathered around the dining table for a Thanksgiving different from the disastrous one of a few years before . We were with my husbands family . The conversation touched on sports , the weather , politics , and then eventually on O.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make there . " Oh , that man kill his wife , " she said with great authority . " I there . I see it . " " You mean you saw it on television , " I corrected . " No ! " my mother insisted . " I there . He hide in bush , jump out , cut the knife on that girl 's throat . So much blood , you can not believe so much . Awful . " That was the moment I could no longer deny to myself that something was terribly wrong . She was certainly at an age when Alzheimer 's could be a possibility . On the way home , my husband and I agreed we needed to take her to the doctor . To get her there would require subterfuge . I told her we were going for a checkup . " I already checkup this year , " she said . " We need another one , " I said , and then I took the plunge : " I think we should check out this problem with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , sometimes you forget things .... It could be due to depression . " And my mother shot back : " Nothing wrong my memory . Depress " cause can not forget . " Then she started to recount the tragedies of losing her mother , my brother , my father . She was right . Nothing was wrong with her memory . " Well , let 's just go to the doctor to check your blood pressure . Last time it was high . You do n't want to have a stroke , do you ? " A week later , we were in her internist 's office . He asked her a few questions . " How old are you ? " " Oh , I already almost 81 . " The doctor glanced at my mother 's chart . " She might mean her Chinese age , " I said . The doctor waved away my explanation . What I wanted to tell him , of course , was the problem with her age , how my father had put the wrong year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , and it had always been a source of massive confusion and exasperation in our family . The doctor posed another question : " How many children do you have ? " " Three , " she said . I puzzled over her answer . The doctor , of course , had no idea what the correct answer was , but neither did I , unless I knew what context my mother was using . Maybe the three referred to the children she had had with my father : two sons , one daughter , though one son had died in 1967 . " What about Lijun , Jindo , and Yuhong ? " I gently prodded , reminding her of my half sisters-her daughters from her first marriage . She had been separated from them from 1949 until 1978 , so in some ways they had been lost to her as children . When they reappeared in her life , they were " old ladies " by her estimation , not children . My mother recalculated her answer . " Five children , " she decided . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living children , three from her first marriage and two from her second . The doctor went on : " I want you to count backward from one hundred and keep subtracting seven . " My mother began to count . " Ninety-three . " " And seven from that ? " the doctor asked . My mother paused and thought hard . " Ninety-three . " I remember feeling bad that my mother , the one who scolded me for anything less than straight A 's , was now failing miserably . While I knew she had a problem , I was not prepared to see how bad it truly was . The doctor did a brief physical , testing my mother 's reflexes , tapping her tiny knees , running his stethoscope over her doll-like body . The test was almost over when the doctor made an innocuous remark , which I can no longer recall . Perhaps he apologized to my mother for putting her through so many questions , as if she were on trial . Whatever it was , my mother began to talk about O.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had been right there when he killed his wife . The doctor gave me his diagnosis that day , although I did not really need to hear it . Some months later , I decided to throw a black-tie dinner in a nightclub for my mothers 80th birthday . I invited family and all her friends . I hired a professional ballroom dancer because my mother adored dancing . In the invitation , I enclosed a note about my mother 's diagnosis and said the best present anyone could give her was continued friendship . I did not know the term for Alzheimer 's disease in Chinese , nor did my sisters . They described it to my aunt and uncle in Beijing as " that malady in the head that affects old people , " in other words , benign forgetfulness . I could tell by my sisters ' attitude that they had no idea how serious this disease really was . To them , it was an illness of guilt , their guilt for having been inattentive , that had caused our mother to become inattentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My auntie Su said that her sisterin-law 's mind had slowed because she did n't have enough people to speak to in Shanghainese , her native tongue . She promised she would take my mother out to lunch more often and talk to her . My sister Jindo sent Wisconsin ginseng , the best kind , she said . " She will get better , " she assured me . None of my sisters felt the numb shock I did in recognizing our mother 's brain was dying and , with that , she would disappear even before her death . Yet , as I discovered , her memory losses were not always a bad thing . For instance , she no longer dwelled on what had happened to my father and older brother . Instead , she began to talk about happier days , the trips she and I had taken together and my bad behavior as an adolescent . " So much headache you give me , " she would claim proudly . It was astonishing how much she remembered . She could summon the past better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she talked about the first time she met my father . What a joyful day that was . " You remember ? " she said . " You with me . " " Tell me , " I said . " Your memory is better than mine . " " We in a elevator , " she reminisced . " All a sudden , door open . You push me out and there your daddy on a dance floor , waiting . You smiling whole time , tell me go see , go dance . Then you get back in elevator , go up . Very tricky , you . " Instead of being saddened by her delusion , I was choked with happiness . She had placed me in her memory of one of the best days of her life . Then , a new stage of my mother 's illness began . More delusions took hold . One day , she told me she believed my husband was having an affair with a Chinese woman at Lake Tahoe . She had gone there and seen the whole sordid mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Lou had taken care of her as lovingly as any Chinese son . He had purchased her home , had taken care of all her financial needs , had served her first at every meal , and was always available to take her to the hospital or to search for solutions for her care . But now , at our twice-weekly dinners at her favorite restaurant , she glared at him the entire time . Back home , day and night , she called me every 20 minutes to tell me I had to leave him . After two weeks , I figured out what I had to do to make her stop . I could not argue with delusions . I had to acquiesce to them . When the phone rang next , I answered with a sad voice . I informed her that I had kicked Lou out of the house . ( Lou , who was standing nearby , looked at me with a puzzled face . ) " So now you believe me , " she said . " You 've always been right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only you can protect me from everything bad . " Yes , my mother said . " Everyone else , they do n't care . But you do , because you are my mother . Only you are this good to me that you would worry this much . You know me better than I know myself . You know what can hurt me . You are the best mother . " " Now you believe , " she whispered in a grateful voice . Then she said what every good mother would say . " OK , go get something eat now . " " I ca n't , " I answered . " There 's nothing to eat in the house . Lou used to go to the store to get food . But now he 's not here . And I ca n't go out at night ' by myself . Someone might rob me . " " But you hungry ? " " Well , only a little , but really , it 's OK . I wo n't starve between now and morning . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good mother can not bear to think her child 's stomach is empty . " You scared , all alone ? " she asked . " A little , " I replied . " The house is so big now that I 'm by myself . But I'll. check the doors often to make sure no burglars can get in . Good thing I 'll be moving to a smaller place . " " Moving ? Why ? " " You know , with the divorce , Lou will get half of everything . We 'll have to sell the house and cut up the money . And if I marry someone else and divorce that man , he 'll get half of that half , so then I 'll be left with one quarter of what I have now . That 's how it is when you divorce your husband . " My mother began to recall Lou 's better qualities . He bought me groceries , he drove me around , he was strong . She advised me to forgive him . Of course , I should punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow I should take him back . " What good advice , " I told her . " Only you know how to save my marriage and my house so I wo n't be poor . " What had started as subterfuge on my part grew into an epiphany . I began to see how much I actually knew about my mother and myself . She was losing her mind , yes , but I was losing the defenses I had built up and fortified from childhood . The scars were dissolving and our hearts were becoming transparent . How could I have been so stupid not to know this all these years ? It had been so simple to make my mother happy . All I had to do was say I appreciated her as my mother . I now knew the answers to my mothers impossible questions . " When you coming home ? " was a common one when I was traveling and would call to check on her . If I gave her an actual date , she would ask five minutes later , " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would say over the phone , no matter how long Lou and I would be gone . " Because we 've missed you so much . We love you so much we ca n't wait to come home and see you . You are the most important person to us in the whole world . " And she would stop asking . That was all she needed to know . In the last week of my mother 's life , she began to talk to ghosts . " Nyah-nyah , " she moaned in Shanghainese , and waved to someone she saw above her . Then she motioned to me , indicating that I should invite this ghost to come in . She spoke gibberish in a shaky voice , yet I could still translate : " Sit , sit . Tea . Quick , quick . Coat , coat , best coat . " And I fetched the mink out of her closet and placed it where the ghost might have sat down . I finally thought to ask what Nyah-nyah meant . " A Shanghainese nickname for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . And then I remembered a story my mother had once told me , of her being four years old , delirious and near death as she called to her grandmother to stop the pain . My mother had been horribly injured when a pot of boiling soup fell across her neck . Nyah-nyah had sat by her bedside , day and night , telling her that her funeral clothes had already been made but were very plain because she had not lived long enough to deserve anything more elaborate . She told the little girl that everyone would soon forget her because she had lived too short a time for them to remember much . That was how Nyah-nyah , who loved my mother very much , scared her back to life . Now my mother was calling for Nyah-nyah once again . This time I think Nyah-nyah was telling my mother that her funeral clothes had already been made , and not to worry , they were fancy beyond belief . Shortly afterward , my mother fell into a coma . Ten to 20 family members-real ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day and night . We played poker and mah-jongg . We ate pizza and Chinese takeout . We played videos of her favorite movies , Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals , including one she used to call " Southern Pacific . " I put on a CD of Chopin piano music and whispered in her ear : " That 's me playing . I 've been practicing harder . " For four days my mothers breathing kept us in suspense . During the last hour of her life , as my mother 's skin turned gray , our family murmured that we loved her very much and were sad to see her go . We whispered to her all the things we would miss : her dumplings , her advice , her humor . To myself I mourned : Who else would worry about me so much ? Who else would describe in explosive detail what might happen to parts of my body if I was careless ? Who would be frank enough to warn that my husband might exchange me for a younger woman unless I forced him to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave both me and the gems behind ? My mother did not speak during chose last four days , but with her final breath , a long release of an exhalation , she uttered a faint sound , a single sustained note . I had to bend my ear to her mouth to hear . I was the only one who heard it , but I do n't think it was my imagination . It was as if our mother , this woman who had been so full of surprises up to the last day of her life , had just said , " Ah ! " to signal that she had gone on to her next surprise . In the opening chapter of The Joy Luck Club , I imagined a young woman whose mother has just died . They are now separated by death , seemingly without reconciliation . There was never any one great fight that divided them , just life itself over the years , petty misunderstandings , and the desire of the mother to give her daughter advice and the daughter 's desire to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? At the end of that story , the daughter learns something , realizes something , something obvious that has been there all along , and she is ready to take her mother 's place at the mah-jongg table , on the east , where things begin .
