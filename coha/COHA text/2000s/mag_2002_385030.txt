The Screen Headnote COMEDY CENTRAL 'S goofball irrelevance-embodied in its low-rent " stars " - is very nearly a metaphor for what makes this country great // COMEDY CENTRAL is where the hip and cheesy sides of cable programming come together . It 's a T-shirt cart in the shopping mall , the Beav to parent network HBO 's Eddie Haskell . Since Haskell Box Office predictably keeps the A-list comedy stuff for itself-the marquee-name specials , like Jerry Seinfeld 's , that get promoted like heavyweight-boxing matches at which only the champion has shown up-nothing on the Beav 's schedule will ever look like event TV . Still , you 've got to have agimmick , so Comedy Central cannily touts fecklessness as its stock in trade . No other network is so proud of helping America fritter away its time . Close to twenty years after David Letterman first turned cynicism about the medium into his version of relishing life , that kind of knowing attitude has gotten fairly corny itself . It 's another hand-me-down , like the venerably slobby SNL-alum movies ( Caddyshack again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heavy rotation to give today 's young people a sense of cultural roots . But the awareness that even its cheekiness is old hat keeps the channels shtick likable . Like so many specialty cable outlets , it invites viewers to join a fake subculture-one whose assumed virtue , impudence , is actually no more at odds with convention than being into model trains . Because the style of hype that 's now in vogue elsewhere on the tube , from HBO to Bill O'Reilly , is to act stunned by your own impact , even an affectation of genial inconsequentiality has its benefits . Daily Show host Jon Stewart is the closest thing Comedy Central has to a star , but what makes him perfect for the gig is that his whole demeanor signals just what a modest category that is . The key to Stewart 's sanguine charm is that he 's smart enough to communicate how unlikely his wiseacre takes on the news are to make waves or nettle anybody this side of Lynne Cheney . Instead , as if to prove that irony can be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up providing exactly the same service as the real-life anchors his act parodies do . To fans , he 's a soothing presence-someone they can count on to stay unfazed , just like Peter Jennings . Comedy Central does have its Little Network That Could side , starting with the only one of its shows to actually offend people : South Park , still scatologizing away well after the buzz has turned into just another burp . Probably to its own surprise , the channel was also the stateside venue for one of the epitomizing shows of the nineties , the Brit import Absolutely Fabulous , whose vodka-swilling heroines delighted American bobos fed up with the age of abstinence . Because the satire 's targets were too entertaining to seem reprehensible , nobody paid any heed to the fact that the show was supposed to be a slam at narcissism , not a brochure for it . Besides opening the door to Sex and the City , which not only bought the brochure but mistook it for a self-help manual , AbFab gave American drag queens their gaudiest new icons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't really . I 'm just trying to see if I can start a panic . While both those series also sparked the kind of intense fandom that can turn fake subculture into the real thing , it 's probably telling that the channel 's attempts to parlay them into more than flukes have gone nowhere . South Park honchos Trey Parker and Matt Stone tried to up the outrageousness ante with the live-action sitcom That 's My Bush ! and last fall , Comedy Central prevailed upon AbFab creator Jennifer Saunders to crank out six new episodes . But Bush got canceled before depicting George W. as bubble wrap in a suit turned into yesterday 's idea of satire , and even SUVs do n't run out of gas as fast as the new AbFab did . // Patsy and Edina aside , though , nobody 's ever goingto watch Comedy Central to feel chic . It 's always goingto be the place where you channel-surf for your kazillionth sampling of ten choice minutes of Airplane !  --  the greatest movie ever made , and I wish Julie Hagerty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're so sophisticated that you prefer the UK 's Whose Line Is It Anyway ? to ABC 's Drew Carey-ized version . And if you 're me , you also tune in because you ca n't get enough of Ben Stein . Actually , I can . Suspecting I 'd be forced against my will to remember that he 's a putz , I never did check out the man 's talk show , Turn Ben Stein On-one more of Comedy Central 's fizzled attempts to crank up the in-house talent 's star power from 40 watts all the wayto 60 . But Win Ben Stein 's Money , his mock game show , has been doing a swell job of helping me turn my gray matter into Play-Doh practically since its debut It 's a series that should have been on public TV twenty years ago and looks as if , in a more skewed universe , it was . Cluttered with bric-a-brac that 's at once pompous and infantile , the set resembles across between the environment an imaginative kid might have pictured while listening to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of a cultivated drunk 's hangover . It 's Pee-Wee 's Playhouse for people who wish they 'd gone to Columbia when Lionel Trilling was in flower . Everything about the show is parodic . Even by pre-Reege standards , the money 's aj oke ; next to the lucky wights who win a measly five grand for trumping Ben 's trivia knowledge , three-time Jeopardy ! champs make out like robber barons . Dumb rituals proliferate : When the host departs from formula by merely announcing that he 's going to switch roles and " become a contestant " instead of saying " common contestant , " as is his wont , it 's enough to make you feel deprived of some tiny but mysteriously vital part ofyour well-being . The questions are more arcane than Jeopardy ! ' s , with pop culture getting short shrift compared with politics , science , and bigbusiness-though not literature , an area Ben appears to know like the back of his head . But the names devised for the categories are terrible puns and snarky double entendres , which are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth grader in you chortles . Because the show is designed to jokily play up Stein 's alienation along with his obnoxiousness , he continually bemoans the childish salaciousness that surrounds him . It also stands next to him in human form , since his cohost-pop-eyed , divinely slatternly Nancy Pimental , who writes for South Park and talks like it too-is as uninhibited as Ben is uptight At once Gracie Allen turned tramp and the street-smart , saucily indifferent Lolita to Stein 's grumpily beleaguered Humbert , Pimental is such a delirious wonder that I 'd give up Allison Janney for her ; she acts as if she started sleeping around mostly so she 'd have more things to make fun of . On Win Ben Stein 's Money , she 's the one prize Stein ca n't have . Already granted minor league immortality by his turn as the droning teacher in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off , Stein is amore genuine egghead than John Houseman ever was , which is what makes his apotheosis here so fetchingly bizarre . His progress from inside-the-Beltway economist 's son and junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central trivia maven is the stuff of a Kurt Vonnegut novel , albeit one whose narrator is a bore . That he was the Nixon White House 's token representative of sixties youth leaves you wondering which ofthem to weep for , but these days he 's one lucky dog ; not many people get to be themselves and caricature themselves simultaneously . I 'm fonder of the caricature than I am of the real Stein , who 's a walking quaalude in his other roles as Republican gadfly , sentimental memoirist , and tireless op-ed flack for capitalism 's glories . In his quiz-show incarnation , though , he 's the missing link between Henry Kissinger and Portnoy . Among other things , you should take that as a hint that Stein 's Jewishness is n't exactly beside the point in this context . In fact , he 's gotten flak for giving ammo to anti-Semitic stereotypes ; not only is his TV persona that of a gratingly arrogant know-it-all , the premise is that he 's moneygrubbing . But all game shows are allegories , including this parody version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti-Defamation League-and maybe Mensa , too-to rueful recognition , not picketing . The show is really all about Stein as an exotic-a figure as odd and unworldly as E.T. , plunked down amid heartland America 's alien corn . That 's partly because , Stewart aside , Comedy Central is one goyish network . And game shows are one goyish format , which is why it 's fascinating to watch the interplay between Ben the brainy Jewish fella and the predominantly Anglo-Saxon , generally less cerebral contestants who go up against him . He 's amused and so are they , but what tickles everybody is a slightly wary , slightly titillated sense of incongruity . Since Stein thinks they 're every bit as strange as they think he is , both host and guests act as if they 're at the zoo , and nobody can say for sure who 's on which side of the bars ; they 're just mutually aware of how unlikely it is that they 'd encounter each other in any other setting . It 's like the famous scene inA nn ie Hall when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are picturing him in Hasidic garb , except that Woody left out how he pictured them . Forget Vonnegut , though . Win Ben Stein 's Money really is something Philip Roth should have dreamed up . Stein 's role on the show is to act out the folk wisdom that Jews are smarter than most people . But what befalls him even when he bests his challengers confirms the Anglo-Saxon prejudice that they 're smarter only because goys have more enjoyable things to do . His symbolic comeuppance , which also transforms Ben the imperious intellectual into an appealingly forlorn figure , consists in the audience 's satisfied recognition that no matter how smart he is , he 'll never get to sleep with the shiksa-Pimental , of course . She replaced original sidekick Jimmy Kimmel , whose carefree frat-boy act made him almost as good a foil to Stein 's persnickety streak . But Kimmel was n't an object of desire . Once sex got added to the mix , the subliminal conflicts that the show hides in plain sight became more acute and much funnier . ( Tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenwriter , Pimental 's splitting in late March . ) None of that makes Win Ben Stein 's Money one bit less silly . But I swear that it 's almost as rich in metaphor as Buffy the Vampire Slayer-all about intellectuals as freaks , and Jews as outsiders , and America as a land where brains will get you everything except nooky . No other medium can put across the kind of stylized comic insights these constructs amount to the way TV can , because only TV can turn them simultaneously humdrum and attractive . And yes , I know , that does n't mean that Comedy Central is n't wasting my time . But the way they do it sure does keep me interested .
