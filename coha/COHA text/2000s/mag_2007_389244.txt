Headnote THE PILL PIPELINE Jerry 's your quintessential streetwise New Yorker , Midnight Cowboy 's Ratso Rizzo come to life . He lost most of his front teeth years ago when he stumbled off a subway platform while nodding out on heroin , but his smile remains wide and boyish , and it is on nonstop display as we stalk the city 's Ninth Avenue drug corridor , the last vestige of pre-gentrification Hell 's Kitchen . The midday sun is bright as Jerry solicits strangers and old buddies- " You seen noncontrol ? " - while conspicuously clutching his pharmacy bag . " Noncontrol " is shorthand for dealers who specialize in a reverse drug trade : Rather than selling illegal narcotics to addicts , they buy prescription medications from them- " noncontrolled substances " in legal parlance-and aids medications are at the core of their business . Jerry ( who , like ? other aids patients in this story , has been given an alias ) tested HIV-positive a decade ago , after half a lifetime bouncing in and out of lockup for various burglaries , thefts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his first opportunity to feed his drug habit without going right back to prison . He 'd use his New York state Medicaid card to buy prescriptions worth hundreds of dollars , then turn around and sell them on the street for as little as $20 a bottle . " You 'd take it , out of desperation , " he sighs . These days he 's clean and not as desperate for cash , so on this particular foray he 's just unloading some painkillers and the Marinol his doctor prescribes to help his appetite . When we finally track down the noncontrol man , Jerry nets $80 . AIDS drugs are among the world 's most expensive pharmaceuticals , and the noncontrol man can resell them for astronomical profits . No estimate exists of the size of the black market in AIDS drugs , but experts agree that it 's grown exponentially as these medications have become widely available in the industrialized world while remaining out of reach in the Third World . In the United States , some black-market pills are bought by pharmacists who turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illicit supply line leads to the Caribbean , particularly the Dominican Republic , where AIDS rages with an intensity second only to that of sub-Saharan Africa , and where the drugs ' prohibitive pricing has fueled a hodgepodge trade in pills bought on the streets of New York , and underwritten by the state 's Medicaid program . The AIDS drug trade has attracted the attention of officials-including the Medicaid fraud unit of the state attorney general . One doctor told me that for the past three years she 's had to notify Medicaid each time she writes a prescription for any of her 300-plus mv-positive patients . Doctors worry that a crackdown will affect the already tenuous relationship they have with patients , many of whom are distrustful-if not paranoid-at the best of times . Patients who can get Medicaid to pay for their legal drugs but ca n't get into treatment for their addiction to illegal ones ( according to a 2000 federal study , 57 percent of Americans who need drug treatment ca n't get it ) will peddle whatever prescription meds they can to feed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going away . To follow the AIDS drug trail , I headed to Santo Domingo , the capital of the Dominican Republic , where I met Dr. Carlos Adon , an AIDS doctor at one of the city 's busiest clinics . Adon studied both drama and medicine , and his manner is as much theatrical as diagnostic . Insatiably social , with a bright smile radiating from an open face , he moves with a youthful fluidity . That 's essential to his work , because he is in constant motion : In between conferring with patients , his receptionist , a mother desperate to get her Hiv-positive son out of jail , and a man on the phone who is fruitlessly working him for information about a girlfriend ( " She 's coming to see you , is n't she ? She has AIDS , does n't she ? " ) , he 'll cut me off mid-sentence when he hears a pleasing riff in the merengue that constantly ricochets around Santo Domingo : " Shhhh ! Listen . That 's niiice . " Much of Adon 's clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both depressingly common and often kept secret . Officially , the national infection rate is just under 2 percent ( which would still mean almost 90,000 Dominicans are HIV-positive ) , but studies suggest that in some regions the real rate is closer to 15 percent . One-sixth of the Dominican Republic 's population is unemployed , and in a country with an $8,000 per capita GDP , AIDS drugs that start at around $200 to $300 for a month 's supply of even one of the cheaper pills are utterly out of reach . So Adon 's patients get creative . New York dealers sell the medications to the Dominican Republic via middlemen in pharmacies and bodegas , or through family members ; some patients are lucky enough to have doctors ' prescriptions to guide them , while others simply take whatever medications their relatives can scrounge up . " People think that , " Well , if it worked for Juanita in New York , it will help Maria in Santiago , ' ' " Adon sighs . " They do n't understand the drug interactions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of his patients : He goes to great lengths to avoid getting involved in the black market directly , but will slip patients a name or a phone number , if that 's the only way they 're likely to get on medication . " It is something I can not fight , " he declares resolutely . " People want to live . " Carlos , a slight , soft-spoken man who makes a living ferrying tourists around the town of Boca Chica , arrived in Adon 's office in 2000 , near death . He 'd tested positive a few years before but had been unable to afford the 30,000 pesos , or roughly $1,000 , a month for black-market meds . " I do n't even make 8,000 pesos in my good job , " Carlos laughs . Adon started him on an older , cheaper drug combination , and then Carlos " brother-in-law in the Bronx began buying meds from the noncontrol man-so often , in fact , that Carlos now supplements his $300 monthly income by reselling pills he does n't need for about $80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Adon , holding out his hands to cup an imaginary treasure , " like diamonds for somebody , because they see their life in there . And it is in there . " - Kal Wright Author Affiliation Kai Wright ( " Psst , Got Antiretrovirals ?
