<p> Rasheen Leggett stood on the Bronx side of the Willis Avenue Bridge , squinting , craning his neck and relishing the unending tide of marathoners . With a proud smile , he shouted his official welcome to the United States mainland . <p> " Yeah , baby ! " he yelled . " Welcome to the South South Bronx ! " <p> As the only leg of the race that is not on an island , this one-mile stretch of Mott Haven makes up in pain what it lacks in distance . Between two bridges and one Bronx mile is the Wall , where legs become leaden , eyes glaze over and pain becomes all-encompassing . <p> Yet it is somehow fitting that this test at the 20-mile mark snakes through this South Bronx neighborhood , where generations of immigrants and working stiffs have confronted their own walls . Manhattan may have the crowds , but Mott Haven has heart . <p> Although the borough 's official motto is Ne Cede Malis  --  Yield Not to Evil  --  on marathon day in Mott Haven it becomes Yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leggett , a carpenter by trade and race fan by inclination , walk from his nearby apartment to offer encouragement ? <p> " I 'll give them support , " he said yesterday . " I 'm a working man , myself . And these people are working . They 're really working , you know what I 'm saying ? " <p> He looked at the runners , their faces tinged with exhaustion and gratitude . <p> " Yeah , baby ! " he shouted . " Keep it going . That 's what I 'm talking about ! " <p> Manhattan is but a memory here , a distant scrim of high-rises , restaurants and shops . Mott Haven 's towers are massive housing projects , and the shops along 138th Street specialize in home-cooked food that only serves to remind the latest arrivals from Mexico that they are far from home . <p> Mexican flags lined the course on Alexander Avenue , where the Rev. John Grange tends to his immigrant flock at St. Jerome 's Roman Catholic Church . On race day , he says the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This church has been part of his life since he was born in this neighborhood 65 years ago . He and his five siblings grew up in a series of railroad flats near the church , when the neighborhood was solidly Irish . <p> " Everybody ran in the neighborhood , " he said . " You ran away from the cops . You ran away from your parents . You ran away from somebody wanting to beat you up . As kids , we were always running somewhere . " <p> Eventually the Irish just ran away . But he stayed and ministered to a congregation for whom poverty is a day-to-day  --  sometimes hour-to-hour  --  struggle . <p> The onslaught of reporters , motorcycle escorts and helicopters that precedes the runners reminds him of the time 25 years ago when Pope John Paul II visited the neighborhood . <p> " He said at Mass , ' Do not forget the Lazarus at your door , " ' Grange recalled . " Do not forget the poor in America . " <p> Outside the church , over the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come and you will see , " among the first words Jesus said to his disciples in the Gospel of John . <p> " Everyone runs past it , but nobody sees it , " Grange said . " Everyone runs past it . I always thought they were the kind of people who could do something good . " <p> Some of the marathoners have noticed and are grateful . Kent Fullenweider remembers the lift he got when he ran through here a few years ago . He said the warmest welcomes were in the poorest neighborhoods . <p> " There was such a generosity of spirit , " he said . " People who might not have eaten last night out there cheering you . You know , anyone who has racial issues should run this marathon . They 'll see some of the most beautiful people . " <p> The biggest Bronx crowds are outside the church , past the woman selling tamales from a cart , near the entrance to the No. 6 train  --  where a few runners have vanished over the years  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry into Central Park a la Rosie Ruiz . Tables and people line the wide , sloping street , which by midafternoon is a crunchy , slick green carpet of tossed paper cups . A band plays off-key , but frantically . Even the little old ladies from the retirement home come out to watch . <p> " You go , girl ! " a young woman shouted to the runners . " Go , Papi ! " <p> Her shouts were drowned out by an earth-shaking sound system . <p> " Ahhhhh , freak out ! " went the disco-era blast . " Le freak , c'est chic . " <p> Mary Engelhardt swayed to the sound . She held a sign aloft that read " George and Williams , " a reference to her marathon-running son and the New England college he attended . She likes this part of the course , which is not too far from where she , a schoolteacher , used to live . If she had her way , more of the race would traverse the Bronx . <p> " They have to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too short now . Is Staten Island even counted , except for that bridge ? We should have them run up the Concourse . All the way up , not just to the courthouse on 161st Street . " <p> The Africans who swooshed by at the head of the men 's pack gave way to runners from every corner of the globe . The race may now be an international event , but it is not the first one in this neighborhood . Twenty-nine years ago , a group of mostly black and Latino high school runners met at the nearby Patterson housing project to start a track team . They called themselves the Bronx International Athletic Club , a grand name chosen to acknowledge an Irish runner from Bainbridge Avenue who was the lone white runner in the group . <p> Roberto Vives , a lanky sprinter whose parents let the fledgling group meet at their apartment , made a life out of track . He directs the track and field program at the State University of New York at Albany . His runners have been named to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride not only at that , but also at the less-heralded sacrifices he saw in the South Bronx . <p> " You know what it 's like to struggle when you see your mother working in a factory and your father working in a grocery store 16 hours a day , " he recalled last week . " It is an enormous struggle , but they made sure I got an education . " <p> One mile . Many lives . <p> " There is no better place than the Bronx for that Wall , " Vives said . " You hit it , leads change . Who can handle the struggle ? What you learn to overcome there leads you to the finish line . People do not understand the struggle in the South Bronx . But we saw it . " <p> Johnadam Haridopolous , a banker whose daily world is far from Mott Haven , remembers his personal struggle from last year 's race . He had hauled his tired body over the Willis Avenue Bridge , ready to drop out , when he saw a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never Give Up . " <p> Yesterday , he stood at the same spot , holding a sign with those same words . <p> " This is where the test is on , " he said . " This is where you start losing it . But this sign got me through to the end . " <p> Welcome to the South South Bronx . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Rasheen Leggett was one of the many vocal fans who lined the marathon 's milelong path through the Mott Haven section of the Bronx . Johnadam Haridopolous , who is a banker , greeted runners coming off the Willis Avenue Bridge to reach Mile 20 of the New York City Marathon . His sign and its message were the same as the one he read when he struggled to cross the same bridge into the Mott Haven section of the Bronx during the 2003 marathon .
