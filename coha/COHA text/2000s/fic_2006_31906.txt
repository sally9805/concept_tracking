The Penderwicks By Jeanne Birdsall Random House Jeanne Birdsall A Boy at the Window For a long time after that summer , the four Penderwick sisters still talked of Arundel . Fate drove us there , Jane would say . No , it was the greedy landlord who sold our vacation house on Cape Cod , someone else would say , probably Skye . Who knew which was right ? But it was true that the beach house they usually rented had been sold at the last minute , and the Penderwicks were suddenly without summer plans . Mr. Penderwick called everywhere , but Cape Cod was booked solid , and his daughters were starting to think they would be spending their whole vacation at home in Cameron , Massachusetts . Not that they did n't love Cameron , but what is summer without a trip to somewhere special ? Then , out of the blue , Mr. Penderwick heard through a friend of a friend about a cottage in the Berkshire Mountains . It had plenty of bedrooms and a big fenced-in pen for a dog-perfect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was available to be rented for three weeks in August . Mr. Penderwick snatched it up , sight unseen . He did n't know what he was getting us into , Batty would say . Rosalind always said , It 's too bad Mommy never saw Arundel-she would have loved the gardens . And Jane would say , There are much better gardens in heaven . And Mommy will never have to bump into Mrs. Tifton in heaven , Skye added to make her sisters laugh . And laugh they would , and the talk would move on to other things , until the next time someone remembered Arundel . But all that is in the future . When our story begins , Batty is still only four years old . Rosalind is twelve , Skye eleven , and Jane ten . They 're in their car with Mr. Penderwick and Hound . The family is on the way to Arundel and , unfortunately , they 're lost . " It 's Batty 's fault , " said Skye . " It is not , " said Batty . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be lost if Hound had n't eaten the map , and Hound would n't have eaten the map if you had n't hidden your sandwich in it . " " Maybe it 's fate that Hound ate the map . Maybe we 'll discover something wonderful while we 're lost , " said Jane . " We 'll discover that when I 'm in the backseat for too long with my younger sisters , I go insane and murder them , " said Skye . " Steady , troops , " said Mr. Penderwick . " Rosalind , how about a game ? " " Let 's do I Went to the Zoo and I Saw , " said Rosalind . " I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater . Jane ? " " I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater and a buffalo , " said Jane . Batty was between Jane and Skye , so it was her turn next . " I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater , a buffalo , and a cangaroo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Skye . " It does not . It starts with a c , like cat , " said Batty . " Just take your turn , Skye , " said Rosalind . " There 's no point in playing if we do n't do it right . " Rosalind , who was sitting in the front seat with Mr. Penderwick , turned around and gave Skye her oldest-sister glare . It would n't do much , Rosalind knew . After all , Skye was only one year younger than she was . But it might quiet her long enough for Rosalind to concentrate on where they were going . They really were badly lost . This trip should have taken an hour and a half , and already they 'd been on the road for three . Rosalind looked over at her father in the driver 's seat . His glasses were slipping down his nose and he was humming his favorite Beethoven symphony , the one about spring . Rosalind knew this meant he was thinking about plants-he was a professor of botany-instead of about his driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you remember about the map ? " " We 're supposed to go past a little town called Framley , then make a few turns and look for number eleven Stafford Street . " " Did n't we see Framley a while ago ? And look , " she said , pointing out the window . " We 've been past those cows before . " " Good eyes , Rosy , " he said . " But were n't we going in the other direction last time ? Maybe this way will do the trick . " " No , because all we saw along here were more cow fields , remember ? " " Oh , yes . " Mr. Penderwick stopped the car , turned it around , and went back the other way . " We need to find someone who can give us directions , " said Rosalind . " We need to find a helicopter that can airlift us out of here , " said Skye . " And keep your stupid wings to yourself ! " She was talking to Batty , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . " They 're not stupid , " said Batty . " Woof , " said Hound from his place among the boxes and suitcases in the very back of the car . He took Batty 's side in every discussion . " Lost and weary , the brave explorers and their faithful beast argued among themselves . Only Sabrina Starr remained calm , " said Jane . Sabrina Starr was the heroine of books that Jane wrote . She rescued things . In the first book , it was a cricket . Then came Sabrina Starr Rescues a Baby Sparrow , Sabrina Starr Rescues a Turtle , and , most recently , Sabrina Starr Rescues a Groundhog . Rosalind knew that Jane was looking for ideas on what Sabrina should rescue next . Skye had suggested a man-eating crocodile , who would devour the heroine and put an end to the series , but the rest of the family had shouted her down . They enjoyed Jane 's books . There was a loud oomph in the backseat . Rosalind glanced around to make sure violence had n't broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car seat-she was trying to twist herself backward to see Hound . Jane was jotting in her favorite blue notebook . So they were both all right . But Skye was blowing out her cheeks and imitating a fish , which meant she was even more bored than Rosalind had feared . They 'd better find this cottage soon . Then Rosalind spotted the truck pulled over by the side of the road . " Stop , Daddy ! Maybe we can get directions . " Mr. Penderwick pulled over and Rosalind got out of the car . She now saw that the truck had TOMATOES painted in large letters on each of its doors . Next to the truck was a wooden table piled high with fat red tomatoes and , behind the table , an old man wearing worn blue jeans and a green shirt with Harry 's Tomatoes embroidered across the pocket . " Tomatoes ? " he asked . " Ask if they 're magic tomatoes , " Rosalind heard . Out of the corner of her eye , she saw Skye hauling Jane back in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Rosalind apologetically to the old man . " Had six of ' em myself . " Rosalind tried to imagine having six younger sisters , but she kept coming up with each of her sisters turned into twins . She shuddered and said , " Your tomatoes look delicious , but what I really need is directions . We 're looking for number eleven Stafford Street . " " Arundel ? " " I do n't know about any Arundel . We 're supposed to be renting a cottage at that address . " " That 's Arundel , Mrs. Tifton 's place . Beautiful woman . Snooty as all get-out , too . " " Oh , dear . " " You 'll be fine . There are a couple of nice surprises over there . You 're going to have to keep that blond one under control , though , " he said , nodding toward the car , where Skye and Jane were now leaning out of the window together , listening . Muffled complaints could be heard from Batty , who was being squashed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rosalind . " I can always spot the troublemakers . I was one myself . Now , tell your dad to go down this road a little ways , take the first left , then a quick right , and look for number eleven . " " Thank you , " said Rosalind , and turned to go .
