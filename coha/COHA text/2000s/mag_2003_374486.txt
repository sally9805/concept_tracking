TIME 's Jeffrey Ressner quizzed SARAH JESSICA PARKER ( Carrie Bradshaw on TV 's Sex and the City ) on something that any celebrity  --  and especially she  --  really knows : shoes . <P> Q : What 's most important : quality , comfort or looks ? <P> A : It 's a tight race between quality and looks . If a shoe designer can manage both , great . Comfort is , in my life , secondary . <P> Q : Why are so many great women's-shoe designers male ? <P> A : Maybe they have more appreciation of ladies ' feet than women do ; they see something beautiful about the silhouette . We 're literally looking down at our feet . Men have a different perspective . <P> Q : How high is too high for high heels ? <P> A : For me , practicality stops at about 4 1/2 in . Other things come under aesthetics : I 'm not particularly fond of a high wedge . But I think a high heel is one of the prettiest things imaginable . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I count on a nice high heel . <P> Q : Last year you had your first child . Any thoughts on shoes and pregnancy ? <P> A : I grew to appreciate a flat shoe toward the last couple of weeks . There were occasions where I had to put on heels , but I wished I had a lifestyle that could afford a bunch of Manolo Blahnik flats . <P> Q : Any favorite baby shoes ? <P> A : I vividly remember the shoes I wore growing up , and I do n't know where I 'm going to find them . There was a standard shoe for spring-summer  --  a T-strap white sandal with the holes poked out in front  --  and also a classic saddle fall-winter shoe . Buster Brown made good ones ; so did Stride Rite . <P> Q : Sneakers ? <P> A : The split-toe Nike . Love it . It 's all I wear when I wear sneakers . They 're really easy to slip off and on ; they 're very light ; they come in great colors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they 're washable . <P> Q : Is there a perfect shoe ? <P> A : It depends on the environment and the circumstances . Manolo makes the perfect heel . There 's something about what his heel does for the slightly forward pitch of a woman 's body that is really superior . He just makes you look sexier . Podiatrists all over America will say I 'm encouraging foot problems , but it 's still a free country . <P> Q : How many " wears " do you get out of a nice designer shoe ? <P> A : A lifetime . I say that not proudly but because I have so many shoes , I do n't wear any of them out . <P> Q : How many do you own ? <P> A : I honestly do n't know . A hundred ? It depends if you 're talking about the pairs in circulation , because I have an archive too . In circulation , about 50 to 60 pairs . <P> Q : Why do n't husbands and boyfriends understand a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , but whatever gene it is , I 'm really glad they do n't have it . It 's one of the nice things that separate the sexes .
