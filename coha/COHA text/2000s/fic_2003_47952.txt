One day , waiting for a bus , standing on a street corner in Lower Manhattan , somewhere near Canal , having completed jury duty , having in fact judged another human being and found him guilty , she thought of justice , that heavy word . As a member of the general worldwide mothers ' union , she had watched the man 's mother . She leaned on the witness bar , her face like a dying flower in its late-season , lank leafage of yellow hair , turning one way then the other in the breeze and blast of justice . Like a sunflower maybe in mid-autumn , having given up on the sun , Faith thought , letting wind and weather move her heavy head . <p> Still the man had held a real gun to the head of the old grocer and taken his half-day 's profit of about twenty-seven dollars . Immediately Faith thought as she often did of the great gun held at the world 's head and the cheaper guns pointing every which way at all the little nations that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit or even Fuck . Many people , some friends , really hated the way she moved from daily fact to planetary metaphor . Others thought she was absolutely right . <p> She leaned against someone 's car , looked up and around , and saw the high six-story wall of a building whose old companion had been torn down , leaving a pale green New York imprint of old staircases , landings , some mysterious verticals and horizontals . She sighed not cosmically this time , but with an appreciation for the delicate but extraordinary designs of time and decadence . A man , passing , stopped , watched her looking and sighing . Well , he said , what do you think , lady ? It 's like the rest of us . It 's going to deteriorate any minute , right ? <p> At home she was surprised by Anthony visiting . It was the middle of the workweek . Here 's Judy , he said . Remember her ? Of course , she said . Then she told him that she was exhausted and thought she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own wintry visage . <p> But Ma , he said , your visage is n't wintrier than it was last week . Right , said Judy . It 's more late October or early November , do n't you think , Anthony ? He smiled to encourage her . She was shy but sometimes made good sentences . Anthony rolled his eyes round and round . When they rested , he said , Honest , folks , that was n't a comment , it was only yoga . <p> Okay , okay , Faith said , there 's some good stuff in the fridge . She wanted to go to her room and sit on the nice chair she 'd recently bought for herself so as to be comfortable when writing things down . She needed to think more about the jury system , mainly her companion jurors . Also the way that capitalism was getting to be a pain in the world 's neck . She thought she might try to make a poem out of that opposition . <p> After about an hour Anthony knocked on the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and have some tea with us . We have some really bad news for you . This was n't true , but if he 'd said , Let 's have tea and pie , and we have some wonderful news for you , she 'd never leave her room . <p> Okay , she said , coming to the door . I 'm ready , I guess . For God 's sake , tell me . <p>
