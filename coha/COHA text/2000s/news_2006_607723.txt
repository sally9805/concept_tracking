<p> Troy Perkins has almost reached the bank of elevators before he remembers the good news . It 's Thursday . Doughnut Day . <p> It 's yet another reason D.C. United 's starting goalkeeper is happy to be arriving at his second job in a Tysons Corner office park , where the many perks include a crash course on the mortgage industry , a bit of extra money to supplement his soccer income and , on Thursdays , doughnuts that Perkins promises are " unbelievable . " <p> Perkins , 24 , has the lowest goals-against average in MLS . He has played every minute of every game for a United side in the midst of its best streak in franchise history . The previous afternoon , he had been named to his first MLS all-star team . <p> Now , he walks into his office at the First National Bank of Arizona , greets his co-workers , logs on to his computer and settles in for his initial task of the afternoon : an employment verification phone call . <p> " It 's very weird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a budding United fan . " You 're like the bad-ass starting goalie  --  it 's like being the quarterback for the best team in the NFL . Ask that guy to do a verification of employment , and he 'd freaking shove it down my throat . But he has no arrogance about him at all . " <p> To be sure , there are financial incentives behind the 20 to 25 hours a week Perkins spends creating customer files , verifying information about borrowers and collecting W-2 forms , bank statements and Social Security cards . Just two years removed from a developmental contract that paid him $850 a month , Perkins earns a base MLS salary of $29,400 . Many of the Chelsea players Perkins will face in the All-Star Game next month earn more in a week . <p> But there are plenty of underpaid MLS players and few mortgage loan processors , and so there are other motivations that send Perkins on his daily commute in a bright red Mini Cooper . He wants to be prepared in case an injury prematurely ends his athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer ; last year he coached a youth team and was turned off by overly competitive parents with unrealistic expectations for their children . He wants to understand the mortgage market , which is why he now speaks easily about debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-value ratios and forms 1003 and 1008 . <p> And what do his teammates make of all this ? <p> " He 's definitely his own breed of guy , " said forward Alecko Eskandarian , Perkins 's former roommate . " He 's just out there , man . He 's different . " <p> Want proof ? Perkins finished his humanities degree at South Florida by doing independent research on the lives of Venetian women during the Renaissance . He currently is studying the poet Robert Bly in his spare time ; " kind of diving into the male psyche and all that kind of stuff , " he said . He reads and discusses the Wall Street Journal with fellow goalkeeper Ryan McIntosh , and offers advice on home electronics and cellphones and mortgage rates to teammates , who consider him the ultimate font of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own meals , specializing in Southern food with the help of an autographed copy of " Good Grits : Southern Boy Cooks . " <p> And then there 's the yachting thing . <p> " I mean , sometimes he comes in here with boating attire , Velcro-strap shoes with some khaki pants and a polo shirt , like he 's coming from the yacht club , " midfielder Brian Carroll said . <p> " If he had the brim hat you could actually call him Gilligan , " agreed goalkeepers coach Mark Simpson . <p> Perkins , who had never been on a boat before college , fell in love with the water and now socializes with friends on the waterfront nearly every weekend . He 's pricing used 50- to 55-foot yachts , hoping to buy one within the next six months and live on it with his wife , Betsy , who is working toward an advanced pharmaceuticals degree at Auburn . In preparation for living on the water , he 's currently tackling a 1,500-page book on watercraft navigation . <p> He had always applied a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters and motivational sayings . When he transferred to Evansville for his senior season because of a coaching change at South Florida , he immediately became a team captain , asking coaches to stay with him after practice and pretty much moving into the weight room . <p> " We could n't keep him out of there , " then-coach Dave Golan said . " I mean , the guy 's a machine . " <p> Perkins was not chosen in the 2004 MLS draft and signed with United , where he began the same routine , pestering Eskandarian to take extra shots on him after practice . <p> " And I remember his first month or two on the team it was so easy for me to score on him , it was hilarious  --  I almost felt bad , " Eskandarian said . " And I 'd be like , ' Dude , have you had enough ? ' and he was like , ' No , 10 more . ' And we kept shooting , kept shooting every day after practice , and sooner or later a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not as easy to score on him anymore . ' " <p> Because of injuries to United 's other two goalkeepers that year , the 6-foot-2 , 190-pound Perkins assumed the starting role while working part time at a sporting goods store . He performed well as a starter , although he eventually ceded the job back to Nick Rimando , who remained the first-string keeper last year . But Perkins had a strong preseason this spring and was pushing for the starting role even before Rimando was injured again . <p> Perkins was shaky in United 's opener , after which he apologized to coaches and asked for another chance . Since then , he has had scoreless stretches of 338 and 247 minutes and has recorded a league-leading seven shutouts , tied for second in franchise history . <p> " His play has been absolutely rock solid , " said Simpson , who said he thinks Perkins could be in the pool of U.S. players invited to future national team training camps . " He has earned his spot , he 's kept his spot and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> All the while Perkins was pursuing his second career . His mother , Debbie , has been in the mortgage industry for more than 25 years , but she did n't encourage her sons to follow suit . Older brother Travis is a golfer on the Nationwide Tour , and Troy never had expressed an interest in mortgages before a friend arranged for his interview in December . <p> " He told me he had a job interview with a mortgage company , and I said , ' Oh Troy , you do n't want to do that , ' " Debbie Perkins said . " He called me back and said , ' I 'm going to start working next week , ' and I 'm like , ' You 've got to be kidding me ! ' " <p> In his interview , Perkins promised to work until 8 or 9 p.m. if necessary , but he 's settled into a less draining routine . He arrives at RFK Stadium around 9 a.m. and leaves at 1:30 or 2 , packing his lunch and heading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working slightly less in weeks when United plays on the road , which he notes on a large office calendar . <p> His co-workers describe Perkins as humble and serious and hardworking ; one supervisor said he has to persuade Perkins to take short breaks to socialize . His office mates only gradually learned about Perkins 's soccer career ; when they found out , several asked what it was like to be a backup . <p> " And I 'm going : ' You know what , I 've been playing , guys . I 've been starting , ' " said Perkins , who did n't tell co-workers about the all-star game , saying it made him uncomfortable and that he does n't like drawing attention to himself . <p> But he signs balls and jerseys for co-workers ' children , was featured in the company newsletter last month and has became a popular target of workplace jokes .

" I did n't care about his soccer , because really that does n't help me . It was about his attitude and his ability . He 's a pretty gifted kid . "
