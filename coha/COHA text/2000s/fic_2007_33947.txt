The interrogation began like any other . Kathryn Dance entered the interview room and found the forty-three-year-old man sitting at a metal table , shackled , looking up at her closely . Subjects always did this , of course , though never with such astonishing eyes . Their color was a blue unlike sky or ocean or famous gems . " Good morning , " she said , sitting down across from him . " And to you , " replied Daniel Pell , the man who eight years ago had knifed to death four members of a family for reasons he 'd never shared . His voice was soft . A slight smile on his bearded face , the small , sinewy man sat back , relaxed . His head , covered with long , gray-black hair , was cocked to the side . While most jailhouse interrogations were accompanied by a jingling soundtrack of handcuff chains as subjects tried to prove their innocence with broad , predictable gestures , Daniel Pell sat perfectly still . To Dance , a specialist in interrogation and kinesics  --  body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also confidence and , curiously , amusement . He wore an orange jumpsuit , stenciled with " Capitola Correctional Facility " on the chest and " Inmate " unnecessarily decorating the back . At the moment , though , Pell and Dance were not inCapitola but , rather , a secure interview room at the county courthouse in Salinas , forty miles away . Pell continued his examination . First , he took in Dance 's own eyes  --  a green complementary to his blue and framed by square , black-rimmed glasses . He then regarded her French-braided , dark blond hair , the black jacket and beneath it the thick , unrevealing white blouse . He noted too the empty holster on her hip . He was meticulous and in no hurry . ( Interviewers and interviewees share mutual curiosity . She told the students in her interrogation seminars , " They 're studying you as hard as you 're studying them  --  usually even harder , since they have more to lose . " ) Dance fished in her blue Coach purse for her ID card , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's Halloween , that either twelve-year-old Wes , his younger sister , Maggie , or possibly both conspirators had slipped into the bag that morning as a practical joke . She thought : How 's this for a contrasting life ? An hour ago she was having breakfast with her children in the kitchen of their homey Victorian house in idyllic Pacific Grove , two exuberant dogs at their feet begging for bacon , and now here she sat , across a very different table from a convicted murderer . She found the ID and displayed it . He stared for a long moment , easing forward . " Dance . Interesting name . Wonder where it comes from . And the California Bureau ... what is that ? " " Bureau of Investigation . Like an FBI for the state . Now , Mr. Pell , you understand that this conversation is being recorded ? " He glanced at the mirror , behind which a video camera was humming away . " You folks think we really believe that 's there so we can fix up our hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide cameras and witnesses  --  there are far better high-tech ways to do so  --  but because people are less inclined to lie when they can see themselves . Dance gave a faint smile . " And you understand that you can withdraw from this interview anytime you want and that you have a right to an attorney ? " " I know more criminal procedure than the entire graduating class of Hastings Law rolled up together . Which is a pretty funny image , when you think about it . " More articulate than Dance expected . More clever too . The previous week , Daniel Raymond Pell , serving a life sentence for the 1999 murders of William Croyton , his wife and two of their children , had approached a fellow prisoner due to be released from Capitola and tried to bribe him to run an errand after he was free . Pell told him about some evidence he 'd disposed of in a Salinas well years ago and explained that he was worried the items would implicate him in the unsolved murder of a wealthy farm owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water system . This had jogged his memory and he 'd grown concerned that the evidence would be discovered . He wanted the prisoner to find and dispose of it . Pell picked the wrong man to enlist , though . The short-timer spilled to the warden , who called the Monterey County Sheriff 's Office . Investigators wondered if Pell was talking about the unsolved murder of farm owner Robert Herron , beaten to death a decade ago . The murder weapon , probably a claw hammer , was never found . The Sheriff 's Office sent a team to search all the wells in that part of town . Sure enough , they found a tattered T-shirt , a claw hammer and an empty wallet with the initials R.H. stamped on it . Two fingerprints on the hammer were Daniel Pell 's . The Monterey County prosecutor decided to present the case to the grand jury in Salinas , and asked CBI Agent Kathryn Dance to interview him , in hopes of a confession . Dance now began the interrogation , asking , " How long did you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't immediately begin to browbeat . " A few years . " " Where ? " " Seaside . " A town of about thirty thousand , north of Monterey on Highway 1 , populated mostly by young working families and retirees . " You got more for your hard-earned money there , " he explained . " More than in your fancy Carmel . " His eyes alighted on her face . His grammar and syntax were good , she noted , ignoring his fishing expedition for information about her residence . Dance continued to ask about his life in Seaside and in prison , observing him the whole while : how he behaved when she asked the questions and how he behaved when he answered . She was n't doing this to get information  --  she 'd done her homework and knew the answers to everything she asked  --  but was instead establishing his behavioral baseline . In spotting lies , interrogators consider three factors : nonverbal behavior ( body language , or kinesics ) , verbal quality ( pitch of voice or pauses before answering ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first two are far more reliable indications of deception , since it 's much easier to control what we say than how we say it and our body 's natural reaction when we do . The baseline is a catalog of those behaviors exhibited when the subject is telling the truth . This is the standard the interrogator will compare later with the subject 's behavior when he might have a reason to lie . Any differences between the two suggest deception . Finally Dance had a good profile of the truthful Daniel Pell and moved to the crux of her mission in this modern , sterile courthouse on a foggy morning in June . " I 'd like to ask you a few questions about Robert Herron . " Eyes sweeping her , now refining their examination : the abalone shell necklace , which her mother had made , at her throat . Then Dance 's short , pink-polished nails . The gray pearl ring on the wedding-band finger got two glances . " How did you meet Herron ? " " You 're assuming I did . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear . " The last sentence was a deception flag , though his body language was n't giving off signals that suggested he was lying . " But you told the prisoner in Capitola that you wanted him to go to the well and find the hammer and wallet . " " No , that 's what he told the warden . " Pell offered another amused smile . " Why do n't you talk to him about it ? You 've got sharp eyes , Officer Dance . I 've seen them looking me over , deciding if I 'm being straight with you . I 'll bet you could tell in a flash that that boy was lying . " She gave no reaction , but reflected that it was very rare for a suspect to realize he was being analyzed kinesically . " But then how did he know about the evidence in the well ? " " Oh , I 've got that figured out . Somebody stole a hammer of mine , killed Herron with it and planted it to blame me . They wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still relaxed . The body language was n't any different from his baseline . He was showing only emblems  --  common gestures that tended to substitute for words , like shrugs and finger pointing . There were no adaptors , which signal tension , or affect displays  --  signs that he was experiencing emotion . " But if he wanted to do that , " Dance pointed out , " would n't the killer just call the police then and tell them where the hammer was ? Why wait more than ten years ? " " Being smart , I 'd guess . Better to bide his time . Then spring the trap . " " But why would the real killer call the prisoner in Capitola ? Why not just call the police directly ? " A hesitation . Then a laugh . His blue eyes shone with excitement , which seemed genuine . " Because they 're involved too . The police . Sure ... The cops realize the Herron case has n't been solved and they want to blame somebody . Why not me ? They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops planted the hammer themselves . " " Let 's work with this a little . There 're two different things you 're saying . First , somebody stole your hammer before Herron was killed , murdered him with it and now , all this time later , dimes you out . But your second version is that the police got your hammer after Herron was killed by someone else altogether and planted it in the well to blame you . Those 're contradictory . It 's either one or the other . Which do you think ? " " Hm . " Pell thought for a few seconds . " Okay , I 'll go with number two . The police . It 's a setup . I 'm sure that 's what happened . " She looked him in the eyes , green on blue . Nodding agreeably . " Let 's consider that . First , where would the police have gotten the hammer ? " He thought . " When they arrested me for that Carmel thing . " " The Croyton murders in ninety-nine ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Seaside . " Dance 's brows furrowed . " I doubt that . Evidence is accounted for too closely . No , I 'd go for a more credible scenario : that the hammer was stolen recently . Where else could somebody find a hammer of yours ? Do you have any property in the state ? " " No . " " Any relatives or friends who could 've had some tools of yours ? " " Not really . " Which was n't an answer to a yes-or-no question ; it was even slipperier than " I do n't recall . " Dance noticed too that Pell had put his hands , tipped with long , clean nails , on the table at the word " relatives . " This was a deviation from baseline behavior . It did n't mean lying , but he was feeling stress . The questions were upsetting him . " Daniel , do you have any relations living in California ? " He hesitated , must have assessed that she was the sort to check out every comment  --  which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my aunt . Down in Bakersfield . " " Is her name Pell ? " Another pause . " Yep ... That 's good thinking , Officer Dance . I 'll bet the deputies who dropped the ball on the Herron case stole that hammer from her house and planted it . They 're the ones behind this whole thing . Why do n't you talk to them ? " " All right . Now let 's think about the wallet . Where could that 've come from ? ... Here 's a thought . What if it 's not Robert Herron 's wallet at all ? What if this rogue cop we 're talking about just bought a wallet , had R.H. stamped in the leather , then hid that and the hammer in the well ? It could 've been last month . Or even last week . What do you think about that , Daniel ? " Pell lowered his head  --  she could n't see his eyes  --  and said nothing . It was unfolding just as she 'd planned . Dance had forced him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and proceeded to prove it was n't credible at all . No sane jury would believe that the police had fabricated evidence and stolen tools from a house hundreds of miles away from the crime scene . Pell was now realizing the mistake he 'd made . The trap was about to close on him . Checkmate ... Her heart thumped a bit and she was thinking that the next words out of his mouth might be about a plea bargain . She was wrong . His eyes snapped open and bored into hers with pure malevolence . He lunged forward as far as he could . Only the chains hooked to the metal chair , grounded with bolts to the tile floor , stopped him from sinking his teeth into her . She jerked back , gasping . " You goddamn bitch ! Oh , I get it now . Sure , you 're part of it too ! Yeah , yeah , blame Daniel . It 's always my fault ! I 'm the easy target . And you come in here sounding like a friend , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rest of them ! " Her heart was pounding furiously now , and she was afraid . But she noted quickly that the restraints were secure and he could n't reach her . She turned to the mirror , behind which the officer manning the video camera was surely rising to his feet right now to help her . But she shook her head his way . It was important to see where this was going . Then suddenly Pell 's fury was replaced with a cold calm . He sat back , caught his breath and looked her over again . " You 're in your thirties , Officer Dance . You 're somewhat pretty . You seem straight to me , so I guarantee there 's a man in your life . Or has been . " A third glance at the pearl ring . " If you do n't like my theory , Daniel , let 's come up with another one . About what really happened to Robert Herron . " As if she had n't even spoken . " And you 've got children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that . Tell me all about them . Tell me about the little ones . Close in age , and not too old , I 'll bet . " This unnerved her and she thought instantly of Maggie and Wes . But she struggled not to react . He does n't know I have children , of course . He ca n't . But he acts as if he 's certain . Was there something about my behavior he noted ? Something that suggested to him that I 'm a mother ? They 're studying you as hard as you 're studying them .... " Listen to me , Daniel , " she said smoothly , " an outburst is n't going to help anything . " " I 've got friends on the outside , you know . They owe me . They 'd love to come visit you . Or hang with your husband and children . Yeah , it 's a tough life being a cop . The little ones spend a lot of time alone , do n't they ? They 'd probably love some friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never flinching . She asked , " Could you tell me about your relationship with that prisoner in Capitola ? " " Yes , I could . But I wo n't . " His emotionless words mocked her , suggesting that , for a professional interrogator , she 'd phrased her question carelessly . In a soft voice he added , " I think it 's time to go back to my cell . "
