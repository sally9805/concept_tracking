<p> In major league baseball and tennis , " playing hurt " may mean slugging away despite a pulled muscle or sprained ankle . In NASCAR , it 's racing at top speed with a broken bone and no pain-killer . <p> Defending champion Tony Stewart intends to do just that Sunday at Dover International Speedway , where he 'll strap into his No. 20 Chevrolet with a broken shoulder blade and race at more than 150 mph , for a few laps at least , before yielding to a relief driver  --  assuming he surrenders the wheel at all . <p> Gutsy in the eyes of some , foolhardy in the eyes of others , Stewart 's race-day plan has reignited debate over NASCAR 's rule requiring drivers to start a race and complete at least one lap in order to collect points toward the season 's championship  --  a rule that , in effect , has forced drivers over the years to race with broken bones , impaired vision and concussions despite risks to themselves and others on the track . <p> It has also raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to race in the hands of injured drivers who may not be clear-headed enough to make a prudent choice . <p> Thoroughbred racehorses may know instinctively to pull up after a calamitous injury ; stock-car racers are n't necessarily as intuitive . <p> " Whether you 're a driver , whether you 're a crew chief or a tire-changer , you do n't want to see anybody else do your job , " former crew chief Larry McReynolds says . " And if they tell you any different , they 're totally lying to you : There 's always that fear , ' Is he going to do it a little better than I can do it ? ' " <p> Finally , Stewart 's injury has become the latest platform for debating the wisdom of NASCAR 's stars dabbling in stock-car racing 's Busch series , the sport 's developmental ranks . That 's where Stewart 's trouble started , with a hard crash during a May 27 Busch race that left him with a badly bruised right shoulder . The next night he crashed again , slamming a concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder blade in the process . <p> Almost immediately the squawking started over whether Stewart should have entered the Busch race at all , considering he was in the thick of the hunt for a third Nextel Cup championship . Why expose himself to additional risk by dropping down to NASCAR 's minor leagues to compete against a less experienced field ? <p> Team owner Jack Roush , for one , understands Stewart 's yen to enter both races , sharing his passion for the sport . <p> " If there 's a race going on , I want to have my feet in it some way , " said Roush , who owns five Nextel Cup teams and four Busch teams . <p> As for the risk , Roush , an accomplished pilot , believes drivers are better served by getting more experience on tracks rather than less . <p> " As a pilot , when you 're at greatest risk is when you 're flying the least , and when you 're flying unfamiliar equipment , " Roush said . " I 'm not concerned about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earnhardt Jr . also defended Stewart . <p> " Who is anybody to tell Tony Stewart what to do with his time ? " Earnhardt said . " If he wants to race , he should race . If he wants to fly a kite , he can fly a kite . Whatever he wants to do , he ought to be able to make that choice himself . " <p> That said , Earnhardt revealed his contract limits him to competing in just a few Busch races . That 's not so much out of concern for his safety , however , as it is Budweiser 's interest in promoting its association with NASCAR 's most popular driver . <p> " They want consistency for the fans seeing me in a red Budweiser car , " Earnhardt said . " They really do n't want to see me in a Taco Bell or KFC car . " <p> For Stewart , the priority is salvaging his quest for the 2006 championship . That means keeping his No. 20 Chevy among the top 10 in the standings , the cutoff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 42nd-place finish dropped him from second to fourth in the standings . <p> If Stewart does n't start Sunday 's race at Dover , he 'll miss out on anywhere from 34 points ( awarded to the last-place finisher ) to 190 points ( the most possible ) . With just 180 points separating fourth and eighth place in the current standings , it 's essential Stewart complete a lap before letting his relief driver , veteran Ricky Rudd , take over . <p> To minimize lost track position , Stewart plans to drive at least until the first caution flag before pulling into the pits for the complicated switch , in which he 'll have to dismount the steering wheel and unhook his safety harness , neck restraint and radio connection before three team members gingerly pull him through the driver's-side window ( racecars do n't have doors ) . <p> Rudd , 49 , is the ideal substitute . He has a good feel for Dover , with four victories on the one-mile oval known as the " Monster Mile " for its bone-jarring , concrete surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for as long as needed . And at 5-feet-8 , he 's just about Stewart 's height , though leaner . Size is a critical factor because racecar seats are custom-made for each driver , encasing them like body armor . <p> In three decades of racing , Rudd recalls yielding to a backup driver just once . <p> " Once you get in that racecar , the adrenaline kicks in and you can drive with a lot of pain and a lot of injuries and actually hamper that injury from healing , " Rudd said . <p> Others have raced with broken shoulder blades ; still others have raced with worse . <p> After breaking his sternum and collarbone in a violent crash at Talladega ( Ala. ) in 1996 , the late Dale Earnhardt notoriously refused to get out of his racecar two weeks later on the grueling road course at Watkins Glen , N.Y. , even though a relief driver was standing by , and finished sixth . <p> McReynolds wonders if Stewart might try a similar stunt . <p> " Trust me , if his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to get him out of it , " McReynolds said . " I go back to Earnhardt at Watkins Glen : His car was great . He was n't about to get out of that thing , no matter what ! If his car had been bad , he probably would have got out the first caution . The biggest thing for Stewart 's team is making that driver understand : ' It 's not how you 're doing ; it 's not how you feel . It 's the possibility of hitting that wall again . ' " <p> But should Stewart be behind the wheel at all ? <p> Some argue that NASCAR should let drivers drop their worst result or two from their final points total each year , making it possible for them to sit out without penalty if injured . <p> According to NASCAR spokesman Ramsey Poston , giving drivers the chance to opt out of one or two races would open the door to potential abuse or manipulation . <p> Others , such as Roush , believe NASCAR should take the onus off injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're fit to race . Instead , NASCAR relies on drivers to produce their own doctor 's medical clearance . <p> " There 's all this pressure that says , ' Get well soon ! We need you ! And , by the way , it 's hurting our effort that you 're not there ! ' " Roush said . " As long as that 's left to the team , as long as that 's left to the judgment of the drivers , as long as it 's left to a doctor that may be a friend or enough of a friend that 's closer than he might be , then it 's hard . " <p> Note : Jeff Burton had the biggest comeback win ever in a Busch Series race at Dover International Speedway , overcoming a 36th-place starting position for his second victory of the season . Burton 's win made Nextel Cup regulars a perfect 14 for 14 in Busch races this season .
