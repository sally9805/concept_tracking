" I 'm a restaurant critic , " I told the woman in the wig shop , " and I need a disguise that will keep me from being recognized . " // " That 's a new one on me , " she said . " Do you have a special restaurant you 're working on at the moment ? " // " Yes , " I said , remembering the fragrant aroma of the soup I had eaten on my last visit to Lespinasse . When I dipped my spoon into the broth shimeji mushrooms went sliding sensuously across my tongue with the lush texture of custard . I tasted lemongrass , kaffir lime , mushroom and something else , something that hovered at the edge of my mind , familiar but elusive . I took another taste and it was there again , that sweetness , hiding just behind the citrus . It came whirling into my consciousness and then slid maddeningly away before I could identify it . // " The food was wonderful , " I told her , " but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too perfect . So I want a foolproof disguise . " // " Try this , " she said , opening a drawer and pulling out a cascade of hair the color of Dom Perignon . As the wig caught the light the color changed from pearl to buttercup . // The hair fell across my face as gently as silk . I squeezed my eyes tight , not wanting to look until it was seated right . I could feel it settle into place , feel the soft strands graze my shoulders just below my ears . // " Wait ! " she cried as my eyes started to open , and she leaned forward and tugged at the wig , adjusting it . " Okay , " she said at last , " you can open your eyes now . " // The champagne blonde in the mirror did not seem to be wearing a wig . The hair looked real , as if it were growing out of the scalp . Even the dark eyebrows looked right , as if this woman had so much confidence she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mouth dropped open . " Oh ! " I said stupidly , " oh my . " // I do n't think I would have recognized myself if we had met walking down the street , and I had yet to put on any makeup . Somehow this cut , this color , made my cheeks pink , my eyes almost violet , my lips seem redder than they had ever been . I felt new , glamorous , bursting with curiosity . What would life be like for the woman in the mirror ? // " You were meant to be blonde ! " cried the saleswoman , packing the wig into an old-fashioned hatbox . She looked wistfully at the hair and said , " You 'll come back and tell me what happens , wo n't you ? " // " You mean whether I 'm recognized at Lespinasse ? " // " Well , " she said , " that too . But what I mostly want to know is-do blondes really have more fun ? " // ( Continues ... ) //    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
