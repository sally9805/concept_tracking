" I 'm sorry about my parents , Mike . " Tom gave the two people in question a look of resentment . " I 'd hoped " He broke off , sighing faintly . " I 'm sorry , I really am . You spent a lot of money on all this . " Mike Stearns followed his gaze . Tom Simpson 's mother and father were standing near the far wall of the cafeteria , some fifty feet away . Their postures were stiff ; their faces , sour . Their very expensive clothing was worn like suits of armor . They were holding the cups of punch in their hands by thumb and forefinger , as if determined to make as little contact with the surrounding festivities as possible . Mike repressed a smile . Ah , yes . The dignitaries from civilization , maintaining their savoir faire among the cannibals . They 'll hold a cup of blood , but damned if they 'll drink it . " Do n't worry about it , Tom , " he said softly . Mike 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed the crowd . The gaze was filled with satisfaction . The cafeteria was a very large room . The utilitarian gray and cream walls had been festooned with an abundance of decorations , which made up in cheerfulness and festive abandon whatever they lacked in subdued good taste . Many of the cafeteria 's plastic chairs had been moved against the walls , providing a bright orange contrastthose few of them that were not holding someone . Long tables ranged near the kitchen were laden with food and drink . There was no caviar , and no champagne . But the crowd which packed the room would n't have enjoyed thefirstfish eggs , yuk ! and the second was prohibited by high-school regulations . Mike was not concerned . He knew his folk . They would enjoy the simple fare which was piled on the tables , thank you , even if it was beneath the contempt of wealthy urban sophisticates . That was true of the adults , even , much less the horde of children swarming all over the place . Mike gave the younger man standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like patting a slab of beef . Tom was the first-string nose guard for West Virginia University 's varsity squad , and looked the part . " My sister married you , not your parents . " Tom scowled . " Does n't matter . They could at leastWhy did they even bother to show up at my wedding , if they were going to act like this ? " Mike glanced at him . For all Tom 's immense size , Mike did n't have to look up . Tom was barely over six feet tall , about Mike 's own height , even if he outweighed him by a good hundred pounds . Tom was back to glaring at his parents . His own face was as stiff as theirs . Unobserved , Mike studied his new brother-in-law . Very new brother-in-law . The wedding had been held not two hours earlier , in a small church less than a mile away from the high school . Tom 's parents had been just as haughtily rude at the church as they were being now at the reception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony in a proper Episcopalian cathedral , notnot This yahoo preacher ! In this yahooshack ! Mike and his sister had abandoned the stark faith of their ancestors in favor of quiet agnosticism . Years ago , in Mike 's case . But neither of them had even once considered having Rita married anywhere else . The pastor was a friend of the family , as his father and grandfather had been before him . The Calvinist fundamentalism of the ceremony had bothered them not in the least . Mike choked down a laugh . If nothing else , it had been worth it just to see the way the pastor 's fire and brimstone had caused obvious constipation in Tom 's sophisticated parents . His humor faded quickly . Mike could sense the pain lurking within Tom 's eyes . An old pain , he thought . The dull , never-ending ache of a man whose father had disapproved of him since he was a smallboy . Tom had been born into one of the wealthiest families in Pittsburgh . His mother was old Eastern money . His father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large petrochemical corporation . John Simpson liked to brag about having worked his way up from the ranks . The boast was typical of the man . Yes , he had spent a total of six months on the shop floor , as a foreman , after he retired from the Navy 's officer corps . The fact that his father owned the company , however , is what accounted for his later advancement . John Chandler Simpson had fully expected his own son to follow in those well-worn footsteps . But Tom had never fit his family 's mold and expectations . Not when he had been a boy , and not now when he was of age . Mike knew that John Chandler had been furious when his son chose WVU over **25;811;TOOLONG given the reason . Football ? You 're not even a quarterback ! And both his parents had been well-nigh apoplectic at their son 's choice for a wife . Mike 's eyes scanned the room , until they fell on a figure in a wedding dress , laughing at something being said by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharing quips with one of her bridesmaids . The contrast between the two girls was striking . The bridesmaid , Sharon , was attractive in a slightly heavy and buxom sort of way . She was very dark complected , even for a black woman . Tom 's sister was also pretty , but so slender that she bordered on being downright skinny . And her complexionvery pale skin , freckles , blue eyes , hair almost as black as her brother'sbetrayed her own ethnic origins . Typical Appalachian mongrel . The daughter and sister of coal miners . Poor white trash . Yup . That 's what we are , all right . There was no anger in Mike 's thought . Only contempt for Tom 's parents , and pity for Tom himself . Mike 's father had a high school education . Jack Stearns had worked in a coal mine since he was eighteen , and had never been able to afford more than a modest house . He had hoped to help his children through college . But the mine roof-fall which crippled him and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quintessential nobody . On the day he finally died , Mike had been like a stunned ox . Years later , he could still feel the aching place in his heart where a giant had once lived . " Let it go , Tom , " he said softly . " Just let it go . If it 's worth anything , your brother-in-law approves of you . " Tom puffed out his cheeks , and slowly blew out the breath . " It is . Quite a bit . " Abruptly , he shook his head , as if to clear his mind for other concerns . He turned to face Mike squarely . " Give it to me straight , Mike . I 'm graduating in a few months . I 've got to make a decision . Do you think I 'm good enough to make it in the pros ? " Mike 's reply came instant and firm . " Nope . " He shook his head ruefully . " Take it from me , buddy . You 'll be right where I wasthe worst possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping , but ... " Tom frowned , still hoping . " You made it . In a way . Hell , you retired undefeated . " Mike chuckled . " Sure did . After all of eight professional fights as a light heavy . " He reached up and stroked the little scar on his left eyebrow . " My last fight I even made it to the second card at the Olympic Auditorium . Pretty big time . " The chuckle came againmore of an outright laugh . " Too big ! I wonbarelyon points . The kid demanded a rematch . And that 's when I finally had enough sense to quit . A man 's got to know his limitations . " Tom was still frowning . Still hoping . Mike placed a hand on his thick arm . " Tom , face it . You 'll get no farther than I did . Realizing that you only beat the kid in front of you because you were a little more experienced , a little savvier , a little luckier . " He winced , remembering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrifying . " But that kid 'll learn , soon enough . And the fact is that he 's a lot better than you 'll ever be . So I quit , before my brains got scrambled . You should do the same , while you 've still got healthy knees . " Again , Tom puffed out his cheeks and , again , blew out a slow breath . He seemed on the verge of saying something , but a motion caught his eye . His brand-new wife was approaching , with people in tow . Tom was suddenly beaming like a child . Watching that glowing smile , Mike felt his own heart warming . Hell of a sweet kid , to come from such cruddy parents . Rita arrived with her usual thermonuclear energy . She started by embracing her new husband in a manner that was wildly inappropriate in a high-school cafeteriaspringing onto him and wrapping both legs around his thighs . Wedding dress be damned . A fierce and decidedly unvirginal kiss accompanied the semi-lascivious embrace . Then , bouncing off , she gave Mike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as vigorous . The preliminaries done , Rita spun around and waved forward the two people lagging behind her . Outside of the accompanying grin , the gesture resembled an empress summoning her lackeys . Sharon was grinning herself . The man next to her wore a more subdued smile . He was a black man somewhere in his fifties , dressed in a very expensive looking suit . The conservative , hand-tailored clothing fit the man perfectly , but seemed at odds with the smile on his face . There was something a bit rakish about that smile , Mike thought . And he suspected , from the man 's poised stance , that the body beneath the suit was far more athletic than its sober cut would suggest . " Mike , this is Sharon 's father . I want to introduce you . " She reached back , more or less hauled the parent in question to the fore , and moved her hand back and forth vigorously . " My brother , Mike Stearns . Doctor James Nichols . Be very polite , brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five scalpels tucked away somewhere . " An instant later she was charging off , hauling Tom and Sharon toward a cluster of people chattering away in a corner of the cafeteria . Mike and Dr. Nichols were left alone . Mike eyed the stranger , unsure of how to open a conversation . He opted for low humor . " My new brother-in-law 's in for a long night " he said dryly . " If I know my sister . " The doctor 's smile widened . The hint of rakishness deepened . " I would say so , " he drawled . " Is she always this energetic ? " Mike shook his head fondly . " Since she was a toddler . " Having broken the ice , Mike took the time to examine the man next to him more carefully . Within a few seconds , he decided his initial impression was correct . Sharon 's father was a study in contradictions . His skin was very dark , almost pure black . His hair was gray , kinky , cut very short . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a longshoreman than a doctor . Yet he wore his fine clothing with ease , and the two rings on his fingers were simple in design and very tasteful . One was a plain wedding band , the other a subdued pinky ring . His diction was cultured , but the accent came from city streets . Then James Nichols was not a big man . No more than five feet , eight inches tall and not particularly stocky . Yet he seemed to exude a certain physical presence . A quick glance at the doctor 's hands confirmed Mike 's guess . The faint scars on those outsized hands had not come from working in the medical profession . Nichols was returning Mike 's examination with one of his own . There seemed to be a little twinkle in his eyes . Mike guessed that he would like the man , and decided to probe the possibility . " So , Doc . Did the judge give you a choice ? Between the Army and the Marines , I mean . " Nichols snorted . There was a twinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Nichols . ' " Mike shook his head . " You poor bastard . He let me pick . Since I was n't crazy , I took the Army . I wanted no part of Parris Island . " Nichols grinned . " Well ... You were probably just up for assault and battery , I imagine . One brawl too many . " He took Mike 's smile for an answer . His own headshake was rueful . " They could n't prove it , since I fumbled the thing like a Laurel and Hardy routine , but the authorities had their dark suspicions . So the judge was hard as stone . Marines , Nichols . I 'm sick and tired o ' you . Either that or six years downstate . ' " The doctor shrugged . " I admit , that judge probably saved my life . " His expression became filled with mock outrage . The accent thickened . " But I still say it ai n't armed robbery when the dumb kid drops the gun on the way into the liquor store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ? Maybe he was just looking for its rightful owner . Not realizing , the poor cherub , that it was a stolen piece . " Mike burst into laughter . When his eyes met those of Nichols again , the silent exchange between them was warm and approving . The way two men , meeting for the first time , occasionally take an instant liking to each other . Mike glanced toward his new in-laws . He was not surprised to see that his riotous gaiety had drawn their disapproving eyes . He met their stern frowns with a smile whose politeness barely covered the underlying mockery . Yeah , that 's right , you rich farts . Two scapegraces , right before your eyes . As close to outright ex-cons as you can get . Heavens ! Nichols ' voice broke into Mike 's silent test of wills with the Simpsons . " So you 're the famous brother , " the doctor murmured . Startled , Mike 's eyes left the Simpsons . " I was n't aware that I was famous , " he protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I imagine . From what I can tell , listening to them gabble over the last couple of days , every one of your sister 's college friends has a crush on you . You 're quite a romantic figure , you know " Again , Mike was startled . And , again , it must have showed on his face . " Oh , come on , Mike ! " snorted Nichols . " You 're still in your mid-thirties , and look younger than that . Tall , handsomewell , handsome enough . But , most of all , you 've got that glamorous history . " " Glamorous ? " choked Mike . " Are you nuts ? " Nichols was grinning , now . " Give me a break . You ca n't fool me . " He made a little sweeping gesture with his hands , indicating himself . " What do you see here ? A very prosperous-looking black man in his mid-fifties , right ? " His dark eyes glinted with humor and knowledge . " And what else ? " Mike eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were n't always a proper doctor . " " Certainly was n't ! And do n't think , when I was your age , that I did n't take full advantage of it . " Nichols ' wide grin changed to a gentle smile . " You 're a classic , Mike . It 's that old tale which always tugs at sentiment . The reckless and dashing black sheep of the family , leaving town before the law could nail him . An adventurous lad . Soldier , longshoreman , truck driver , professional boxer . Disreputable roustabout , even if he did manage to tuck away three years in college . Then " The smile faded away completely . " And then , when your father was crippled , you came back to take care of your family . And did as good a job of that as you 'd done scaring them to death earlier . Quite respectable , now . Even managed to get yourself elected president of your local miners ' union a couple of years back . " Mike snorted . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for his sister , ready to glare at her , when his eyes fell on the Simpsons . They were still frowning at him , so he bestowed the glare on them . " See ? " he demanded . " My new in-laws do n't seem to feel any romantic attraction ' Merespectable ? Ha ! " Nichols ' own gaze followed Mike 's . " Well ... Respectable ' in an Appalachian sort of way . Do n't think Mr. Blueblood over there is mollified that his new daughter-in-law 's brother is a stone-hard union man as well as a damned hillbilly . Not hardly . " The Simpsons were still maintaining the stare . Mike was matching it , and adding a grin to the bargain . The grin was purely feral . A sheer , brazen , unyielding challenge . Nichols would remember that savage grin , in the years to come . Remember it , and be thankful . The Ring of Fire came , and they entered a new and very savage world .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
