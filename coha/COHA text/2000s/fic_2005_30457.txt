Lost Lake LP Chapter One Portland , Oregon  --  The Present The organizers of the Portland Spring Art Fair had lucked out . It had been a very wet March in Oregon and the weather seers were predicting rain through most of April . But Mother Nature had redecorated in the nick of time , storing away the endless precipitation and gloomy black clouds for another day and setting out sunshine and clear blue skies for the weekend of the fair . Ami Vergano had dressed in a multicolored peasant skirt and a white blouse with short puffed sleeves to celebrate the pleasant weather . Ami was just over five-four and still had the solid build of the gymnast she 'd been until she grew in high school . She kept her brown hair short because it was easy to care for . Her big brown eyes dominated her face . Circumstances had turned Ami serious , but her wide , bright smile could light up a room . Ami was delighted at the large crowds that were taking advantage of the first sunny days of spring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth had attracted people since the fair opened , and three of her oils had sold already . She was putting the money from her most recent sale into her purse when someone spoke . " I like that . Is it imaginary or did you paint a real scene ? " Ami turned and found a broad-shouldered man admiring one of her landscapes . His face had the tanned , leathery look of someone who spends a lot of time outdoors . Ami figured him for five-ten and in his mid- to late forties . He was dressed in jeans , moccasins , and a plaid long-sleeved shirt . His long hair was gathered in a ponytail , and he had a scraggly mustache and goatee . He brought to mind the hippies of the peace and love generation in the 1960s . " That 's a forest glade not far from my house , " Ami said . " I love the way you 've captured the light . " Ami smiled . " Thanks . You have no idea how long I worked to get it just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offering his hand . " I have the booth next door . I saw how many people have been going in and out of yours and decided to see what the fuss was all about . " " Ami Vergano , " she said as she took Morelli 's hand . It was large and comforting , like his smile . " What are you showing ? I 've been so busy that I have n't had a chance to look around yet . " " I build custom-made furniture . Take a peek if you get a chance . " " I will . Are you from around here ? I have n't seen you at our shows before . " " First time in Oregon , " Morelli said . " Where 's home ? " " No place , really . I was an army brat . We moved from town to town . I 've been living in Arizona , but it 's too dry . I like the woods , the ocean . " " There 's not much of that in Arizona . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about the fair and thought I 'd see if I could get a few orders . " " How 's it going ? " " Good . One fellow who stopped by just opened an accounting office and he wants a desk , bookshelves , and some other stuff . That should keep me busy for a while . Now I just have to find somewhere to stay and a place to work . " Ami hesitated . She did n't know a thing about Morelli , but he seemed nice . She made a snap decision . " You might be in luck . I have an apartment over my garage that I rent out , and my studio is in a barn behind the house . It has plenty of room for carpentry . There 's even a workshop and power tools . A student was renting but he had to leave school early because of an illness in the family , so the apartment is empty . " " I have my own tools , but that does sound just right . Can I drive out after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . " " What 's the rent ? " She told him and Morelli smiled shyly . " I can make that . " He stepped out of Ami 's booth and looked over at his own . " Got to go . Looks like I have customers . I 'd better sell something now that I have to pay rent . " Ami laughed and waved . " See you around five . " Morelli ducked out , and Ami wrapped her arms around herself . Finances had been tight since her tenant left . She could use the extra money . And it would be fun to have another artist around the place . Morelli seemed nice . She hoped it would work out . Ami Vergano closed the screen door as quietly as she could and stood on the front porch watching Daniel Morelli teach her ten-year-old son how to throw a curveball . They were in the front yard under the aged oak tree that Ami called Methuselah . Morelli was squatting beside Ryan and gently adjusting his fingers on the seams of a badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son 's prize possession . Ryan 's brow wrinkled as he concentrated on getting the grip right , oblivious of the darkness that was descending at the end of a perfect spring day . Morelli was wearing jeans and a black T-shirt advertising a local microbrew . When he stretched out his arm , his biceps , triceps , and forearm looked like coiled rope . For someone approaching fifty , Morelli was in good shape . Ami knew that he ran for miles in the morning because she 'd seen him returning to his apartment lathered in sweat when she was leaving for work . Once she 'd seen him with his shirt off and had been impressed by the etched perfection of his physique . She had also been surprised to see more than one long scar cutting across his back and stomach . " That 's right , " Morelli said , and Ryan grinned with pride . Her son was an energetic , gawky towhead who played Little League with a passion and loved anything to do with baseball ...       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
