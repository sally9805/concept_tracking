Chapter One Who 's the Lucky Bride ? " Guess what , Pete ? " my brother , Fudge , said . " I 'm getting married tomorrow . " I looked up from my baseball cards . " Is n't this kind of sudden ? " I asked , since Fudge is only five . " No , " he said . " Well ... who 's the lucky bride ? " " Sheila Tubman , " Fudge said . I hit the floor , pretending to have fainted dead away . I did a good job of it because Fudge started shaking me and shouting , " Get up , Pete ! " What 's with this Pete business ? I thought . Ever since he could talk , he 's called me Pee-tah . Then Tootsie , my sister , who 's just a year and a half , danced around me singing , " Up , Pee ... up . " Next , Mom was beside me saying , " Peter ... what happened ? Are you all right ? " " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And he just fell over . " " I fell over when you told me who you were marrying , " I said . " Who are you marrying , Fudge ? " Mom asked , as if we were seriously discussing his wedding . " Sheila Tubman , " Fudge said . " Do n't say that name around me , " I told him , " or I 'll faint again . " " Speaking of Sheila Tubman ... " Mom began . But I did n't wait for her to finish . " You 're making me feel very sick ... " I warned . " Really , Peter ... " Mom said . " Are n't you overdoing it ? " I clutched my stomach and moaned but Mom went right on talking . " Buzz Tubman is the one who told us about the house in Maine . " " M-a-i-n-e spells Maine , " Fudge sang . Mom looked at him but did n't even pause . " And this house is right next to the place they 've rented for their vacation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " I said . " What house ? What vacation ? " " Remember we decided to go away for a few weeks in August ? " " Yeah ... so ? " " So we got a great deal on a house in Maine . " " And the Tubmans are going to be next door ? " I could n't believe this . " Sheila Tubman ... next door ... for two whole weeks ? " " Three , " Mom said . I fell back flat on the floor . " He did it again , Mom ! " Fudge said . " He 's just pretending , " Mom told Fudge . " He 's just being very silly . " " So I do n't have to marry Sheila tomorrow , " Fudge said . " I 'll marry her in Maine . " " That makes more sense , " Mom said . " In Maine you can have a nice wedding under the trees . " " Under the trees , " Fudge said . " Tees ... " Tootsie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's how it all began . Chapter Two Pete and Farley That night we went to Tico-Taco for supper . I was n't very hungry . The idea of spending three weeks next door to Sheila Tubman was enough to take away my appetite . I wish the Tubmans would move to another planet ! But until that happens there 's no way to avoid Sheila . She lives in our apartment building . We go to the same school . I kind of groaned and Dad looked at me . " What is it , Peter ? " " Sheila Tubman , " I said . " What about her ? " Dad asked . " We 're getting married , " Fudge said , his mouth full of chicken and taco shell . " I 'm not talking about your wedding , " I said . " I 'm talking about spending three weeks in Maine next door to the Tubmans . " " It wo n't be as bad as you think , " Mom said . " You do n't know how bad I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's finished sixth grade , same as you . " " What 's age got to do with it ? " I said . " She 'll still be the Queen of Cooties . " " What 's cooties ? " Fudge asked . When I did n't answer he tugged on my sleeve . " What 's cooties , Pete ? " " Since when am I Pete ? " I asked , shaking him off . " Since today , " he said . " Well , I prefer Peter , if you do n't mind . " " Pete is a better name for a big brother . " " And Farley is a better name for a little brother ! " I figured that would shut him up since his real name is Farley Drexel Hatcher and he 's ready to kill anybody who calls him that . " Do n't call me Farley ! " he said . Then he really let go and yelled , " I 'm Fudge ! " The waiter , who heard him from across the room , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't have any tonight . But we do have mud pie , which is almost the same thing . " Dad had to explain that we were n't talking about dessert . And Mom added , " We never eat dessert until we 've finished our main course . " " Oh , " the waiter said . But before he had a chance to get away , Fudge looked up at him and said , " Do you have cooties ? " " Cooties ? " the waiter asked . " For dessert ? " He looked confused . Especially when Tootsie banged her spoon against the tray of her baby seat and sang , Cootee ... coo-tee ... " I could tell Fudge was about to ask the same question again , but before he had the chance I clamped my hand over his mouth . Then Dad told the waiter we did n't need anything else right now . The waiter walked away shaking his head and I took my hand away from Fudge 's mouth . As soon as I did , he was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the people at the next table looked over at us . " They 're like nits , " Mom told him , quietly . " What 's nits ? " Fudge asked . " Head lice , " Dad said , almost in a whisper . " Head mice ? " Fudge asked . " Not mice , Turkey Brain , " I told him . " Lice . Little creepy , crawly bugs that live in hair . " I snapped my fingernails at his head the way Sheila Tubman used to do to me . Fudge yelled , " I do n't want creepy , crawly bugs in my hair ! " Now everyone in the restaurant looked over at us . " That 's enough , Peter , " Dad said . " Well , he 's the one who wanted to know . " " That 's enough , " Mom said . It came out sounding like eee-nuff , which got Tootsie going . " Eee-eee-eee-eee ... " Tootsie shrieked , banging her spoon . This is the way it 's going to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down my taco and said , " Maybe I should go to camp in August . " Dad got this really serious look on his face . " We do n't have the money this year , Peter . We would n't be going away at all if it were n't for Grandma , who 's paying more than her share . " " But if you want , you can bring a friend , " Mom said . " A friend ? " I asked . " You mean like Jimmy Fargo ? " They both nodded . Jimmy is my best friend in New York . We 've always wanted to spend the summer together . " What about me ? " Fudge asked . " Can I bring a friend , too ? " I held my breath . " You 'll find a friend in Maine , " Mom told him . " Suppose I do n't ? " Fudge asked . " You 're getting married , " I reminded him . " Does that mean I do n't get a friend ? " Fudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I 'm married and I have friends . Daddy 's married and he has friends . " " What about Uncle Feather ? " I said . Uncle Feather is Fudge 's myna bird . " He 's your friend , is n't he ? " " I ca n't play with Uncle Feather , " Fudge said . " He 's not that kind of friend . And I ca n't marry him either . If he was a girl bird it would be different . " " People do n't marry birds , " I told him . " Some people do . " " Name one , " I said . " The guy who 's married to Big Bird on Sesame Street . " " Big Bird 's not married , " I said . " That 's how much you know ! " Fudge shouted . He 's learned to say that every time someone disagrees with him . It 's a real conversation stopper . " I give up ! " I said , going back to my taco , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out her arms . " Up ... up ... up . " Dad lifted her out of the baby seat and she squirmed until he put her down . Then she took off , toddling through the restaurant , stopping at every table . Fudge scrambled off his chair and ran after her . Eating out with my family is not exactly relaxing . " Here , girl ... " Fudge said , as if he were calling a dog . " Here 's something just for you . " He lured her back to our table and dropped some of his taco on her tray . " Yum ... " he said to her . " Yum ... yum ... yum ... " Dad put Tootsie back into her seat . She stuffed the chicken pieces into her mouth . " I always know what Tootsie wants , " Fudge said . " That 's why I 'm her favorite brother . " " Tootsie does n't have favorites , " Mom told him . " She loves both her brothers . " " But she loves me best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed . When he did , half the food in his mouth wound up on my shirt . I called Jimmy Fargo as soon as we got home . I asked him to come to Maine with us . " Three weeks next door to Sheila Tubman ? " " The houses are really far apart , " I said . Nobody told me this but I was hoping it was true . " You wo n't even be able to see her house . There 'll probably be a forest separating us . " When he did n't say anything I added , " And do n't forget ... Sheila 's scared of dogs so we can get Turtle after her anytime she tries to give us trouble . " Turtle is my dog . He 's big enough to look scary but he 'd never hurt anybody . Lucky for us , Sheila does n't know that . Jimmy laughed . " Maybe I can come for a week . " " A week is n't long enough ! " " Hey , Peter ... no offense ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . " That 's because Jimmy 's the only kid in his family . His parents are divorced . He lives with his father , Frank Fargo , who 's a painter . " How about two weeks ? " I said . " Is your brother bringing his bird ? " " Yeah ... Uncle Feather 's part of the family , " I told him . " Same as Turtle . " " So it will be your mother , your father , Fudge , Tootsie , Turtle , Uncle Feather and you ? " " Right , " I said . " And my grandmother 's coming too . " " The one who taught you to stand on your head ? " " Yeah . " Grandma Muriel is Mom 's mother . She ran a gymnastics camp before she retired . " You think she could teach me ? " Jimmy asked . " Maybe , " I said . " I 'll talk to my father , " Jimmy said . " I 'll let you know tomorrow . " He called back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine . He liked it so much he said he 'd drive Jimmy up and camp out in the area himself . " That 's great ! " I said . Maybe three weeks in Maine would n't be as bad as I 'd thought . Chapter Three The Most Disgusting of Them All It took ten hours to drive to Southwest Harbor , Maine . Ten hours in the backseat of an old Blazer with Fudge , Tootsie , Turtle and Uncle Feather , who would n't shut up . Some myna birds do n't talk at all but Uncle Feather 's not one of them . He 'll repeat anything you say . Finally , I dropped the cover over his cage , hoping he 'd think it was nighttime . " Go to sleep , stupid ! " I told him . Stupid is one of his favorite words . But that did n't work either . " Go to sleep , stupid ... " he chanted , until even Turtle lost patience and started barking . Grandma is really smart , I thought . She 's flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination , Mom started reading to us from a guidebook . " Southwest Harbor is on an island called Mount Desert . " She pronounced it de-sert . " Ice cream , cookies , brownies , pudding ... " Fudge sang . Mom kept right on reading . I do n't know why she thinks Fudge pays any attention to her lectures on history . He hears only what he wants to hear . Everything else goes right by him . " Founded in 1905 , the town of Southwest Harbor ... " You call this a town ? I thought , as we drove through it . There was one street with a couple of shops . And that was about it . But I could tell Mom was really excited . She put down her guidebook and smiled at my father . " Oh , it 's so quaint , " she said . " Is n't it quaint , Warren ? " And my father smiled back and said , " It 's perfect , honey . " Fudge chucked Tootsie under her chin . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Then Uncle Feather started . " Honey ... honey ... honey . " For some reason Tootsie thought that was wildly funny , and she laughed until she got the hiccups . Mom passed a bottle of water to the backseat and I stuck it in Tootsie 's mouth . " Take a left here , Warren , " Mom said to Dad . We turned onto a dirt road , then pulled into a gravel driveway and parked in front of an old , weathered wood house . The first person I saw was the Queen of Cooties herself . She was standing on the seat of a rope swing . It hung from the branch of a big tree in the front yard . She was swinging pretty high when I opened the back door of the Blazer and Turtle jumped out . It had been almost four hours since I 'd walked him and he really had to go . He raced for the woods behind the house but Sheila thought he was heading straight for her . " Help ! " she screamed , wobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lost her balance and fell to the ground . What a dork ! Mom jumped out of the car and ran to her rescue . " It 's all right , " she said , helping Sheila to her feet . " Turtle just had to wee-wee . " How could Mom have used such an embarrassing expression ? By then Mr. and Mrs. Tubman , who had also heard Sheila 's screams , came running out of the house . " Are you okay ? " Mrs. Tubman asked Sheila . " I 'm fine , " Sheila said , brushing herself off . " It was just that disgusting dog ! " Before I had the chance to tell her who was really disgusting , a man with white hair called , " Lemonade ... " We all headed for the house and gathered around the table on the porch . " I 'm Buzz Tubman 's father , " the white-haired man said . He poured each of us a glass of lemonade . " Call me Buzzy Senior . " I polished off my drink really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . " Long trip up here , is n't it ? " he asked . " Ten hours , " I said , wiping my mouth with the back of my hand . He filled my glass again . I did n't even notice Fudge watching until then . " You must be really thirsty , Pete . " " Yeah , " I said . " Remember that time you drank too much Island Punch and you ... " I clamped my hand over his mouth . He still does n't get the difference between stories you tell to strangers and stories you keep to yourself . I looked at Buzzy Senior . " Fudge knows a lot about dinosaurs , " I said , hoping to change the subject . But as soon as I took my hand away from his mouth Fudge laughed . " And Pete knows all about cooties . " " Well , you ca n't know too much about cooties , can you , Pete ? " Buzzy Senior said , smiling at me . " And guess what else ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . " " Do I know the bride ? " Buzzy Senior asked . " It 's Sheila Tubman ! " Fudge said . " Oh , my granddaughter , " Buzzy Senior said . ( Continues ... )
