On the morning of April 14 , 1912 , Annabelle Worthington was reading quietly in the library of her parents ' house , overlooking the large , walled-in garden . The first signs of spring had begun to appear , the gardeners had planted flowers , and everything looked beautiful for her parents ' return in the next few days . The home she shared with them and her older brother Robert was a large , imposing mansion , at the northern reaches of Fifth Avenue in New York . The Worthingtons , and her mother 's family , the Sinclairs , were directly related to the Vanderbilts and the Astors , and somewhat more indirectly to all the most important New York families . Her father , Arthur , owned and ran the city 's most prestigious bank . His family had been in banking for generations , just as her mother 's family had been in Boston . Her brother Robert , at twenty-four , had worked for her father for the past three years . And of course , when Arthur retired one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their history , was predictable , assured , and safe . It was comforting for Annabelle to grow up in the protection of their world . <p> Her parents loved each other , and she and Robert had always been close and gotten along . Nothing had ever happened to upset or disturb them . The minor problems they encountered were always instantly buffered and solved . Annabelle had grown up in a sacred , golden world , a happy child , among kind , loving people . The past few months had been exciting for her , although tempered by a recent disappointment . In December , just before Christmas , she had been presented to society at a spectacular ball her parents had given for her . It was her debut , and everyone insisted it was the most elegant and extravagant debutante ball New York had seen in years . Her mother loved giving beautiful parties . The garden had been covered over and heated . The ballroom in their home was exquisite . The band had been the most coveted in the city . Four hundred people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her look like a fairy princess . <p> Annabelle was tiny , elfin , delicate , even smaller than her mother . She was a petite blonde , with long , silky golden hair , and huge blue eyes . She was beautiful , with small hands and feet , and perfect features . Throughout her childhood her father always said she looked like a porcelain doll . At eighteen , she had a lovely , well-proportioned slim figure , and a gentle grace . Everything about her suggested the aristocracy that was her heritage and that she and all her ancestors and relations had been born into . <p> The family had shared a lovely Christmas in the days following the ball , and after all the excitement , parties , and nights out with her brother and parents , in flimsy evening gowns in the winter weather , in the first week of January , Annabelle had fallen ill with a severe case of influenza . Her parents had been worried about her when it turned rapidly to bronchitis , and then nearly to pneumonia . Fortunately , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had been sick and had run fevers in the evenings for nearly a month . Their doctor had decided finally that it would be unwise for her to travel in her weakened condition . Her parents and Robert had planned a trip for months , to visit friends in Europe , and Annabelle was still convalescing when they left on the Mauretania in mid-February . She had traveled on the same ship with them many times before , and her mother offered to stay home with her this time , but by the time they left , Annabelle was well enough for them to leave her alone . She had insisted that her mother not deprive herself of the trip she 'd been looking forward to for so long . They were all sorry to leave her , and Annabelle was severely disappointed , but even she admitted that although she felt much better by the time they left , she still did n't feel quite up to a long journey abroad for two months . She assured her mother , Consuelo , that she would take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . <p> Annabelle was not the sort of girl one had to worry about , or who would take advantage of their absence . They were just very sorry that she could n't come with them , as Annabelle was herself . She was a good sport when she saw them off at the Cunard dock in February , but she returned home feeling a little dejected . She kept herself busy reading and taking on projects in the house that would please her mother . She did lovely needlework , and spent hours mending their finest bed and table linens . She did n't feel well enough to go out socially , but her closest friend Hortense visited her often . Hortense had also made her debut that year , and the two girls had been best friends since they were children . Hortie already had a beau , and Annabelle had made a bet with her that James would propose to her by Easter . She 'd been right , as it turned out , and they had just announced their engagement the week before . Annabelle could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home soon . They were due back on the seventeenth of April , having set sail four days before from Southampton on a new ship . <p> It had been a long two months without them and Annabelle had missed them . But it had given her an opportunity to regain her health , and do a great deal of reading . After she finished her chores around the house , she spent every afternoon and evening in her father 's library , poring over his books . Her favorites were the ones about important men , or science . She had never had much interest in the romantic books read by her mother , and even less so in the ones loaned to her by Hortense , which she thought were drivel . Annabelle was an intelligent young woman , who soaked up world events and information like a sponge . It gave her lots to talk about with her brother , and even he admitted privately that the depth of her knowledge often put him to shame . Although he had a good head for business , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , whereas Annabelle appeared gregarious on the surface , but had a deep serious nature and a passion for learning , science , and books . Her favorite room in the house was their father 's library , where she spent a great deal of her time . <p> On the night of the fourteenth , Annabelle read late into the night in her bed , and slept unusually late the next morning . She brushed her teeth and combed her hair when she got up , put on a dressing gown , and made her way slowly down to breakfast . She thought the house was strangely silent as she walked downstairs , and she saw none of the servants . Venturing into the pantry , she found several of them huddled over the newspaper , which they folded quickly . She saw in an instant that their faithful housekeeper Blanche had been crying . She had a soft heart , and any sad story about an animal or a child in distress easily reduced her to tears . Annabelle was expecting one of those stories as she smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butler began crying and walked out of the room . <p> " Good lord , what happened ? " Annabelle looked at Blanche and the two undermaids in amazement . She saw then that all of them were crying , and without knowing why , her heart skipped a beat . " What 's going on here ? " Annabelle asked , instinctively reaching for the newspaper . Blanche hesitated for a long instant and then handed it to her . Annabelle saw the banner headlines as she unfolded it . The Titanic had sunk during the night . It was the brand-new ship her parents and Robert had taken home from England . Her eyes flew open wide as she quickly read the details . There were very few , only that the Titanic had gone down , passengers had been put in the lifeboats , and the White Star Line 's Carpathia had hastened to the scene . It said nothing of fatalities or survivors , but only that one could assume with a ship that size and that new that the passengers had been taken off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newspaper reported that the enormous ship had hit an iceberg , and although thought to be unsinkable , it had in fact gone down several hours later . The unimaginable had happened . <p> Annabelle flew into action immediately , and told Blanche to have the car and her father 's driver brought around . She was halfway out the pantry door to run upstairs and get dressed , as she said that she had to go to the White Star office immediately , for news of Robert and her parents . It did n't even occur to her that hundreds of others would do the same . <p> Her hands were trembling as she dressed haphazardly in a simple gray wool dress , put on her stockings and shoes , grabbed her coat and handbag , and ran back down the stairs again , without even bothering to pin up her hair . She looked like a child with her hair flying , as she dashed out the front door and it slammed behind her . The house and everyone in it already seemed frozen in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took her to the White Star Line 's offices at the foot of Broadway , Annabelle was battling a wave of silent terror . She saw a newsboy on a street corner , calling out the latest news . He was waving a more recent edition of the paper , and she made the driver stop and buy one . <p> The paper said that an unknown number of lives had been lost , and that reports were being radioed from the Carpathia about survivors . Annabelle could feel her eyes fill with tears as she read . How could this have happened ? It was the largest , newest ship on the seas . This was her maiden voyage . How could a ship like the Titanic go down ? And what had happened to her parents , her brother , and so many others ? <p> When they reached the White Star offices , there were hundreds of people clamoring to get in , and Annabelle could n't imagine how she could push her way through the throng . Her father 's burly chauffeur helped her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She explained that her brother and parents were first-class passengers on the ill-fated ship . A frantic young clerk took her name , as others went to post lists of survivors on the walls outside . The names were being radioed by the radio operator of the Carpathia , assisted by the surviving radio man from the Titanic , and they had boldly written at the top of the list that at present it was still incomplete , which gave many hope for the names they did not see . <p> Annabelle held one of the lists in her trembling hands , and could hardly read it through her tears , and then near the bottom she saw it , a single name . Consuelo Worthington , first-class passenger . Her father and brother were nowhere on the list , and to steady her nerves , she reminded herself it was incomplete . There were startlingly few names on the list . <p> " When will you know about the others ? " Annabelle asked the clerk as she handed it back to him . <p> " In a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called out behind her . People were sobbing , crying , arguing , as more outside fought to come in . The scene was one of panic and chaos , terror and despair . <p> " Are they still rescuing people from the lifeboats ? " Annabelle asked , forcing herself to be hopeful . At least she knew her mother was alive , although who knew in what condition . But surely , the others had survived too . <p> " They picked the last ones up at eight-thirty this morning , " the clerk said with somber eyes . He had already heard tales of bodies floating in the water , people screaming to be rescued before they died , but it was n't up to him to tell the story , and he did n't have the courage to tell these people that lives had been lost by the hundreds , and maybe more . The list of survivors so far was just over six hundred , and the Carpathia had radioed that they had picked up over seven hundred , but they did n't have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant over a thousand passengers and crew members had been lost . The clerk did n't want to believe it either . " We should have the rest of the names in the next few hours , " he said sympathetically , as a man with a red face threatened to hit him if he did n't hand over the list , which he did immediately . People were frantic , frightened , and spiraling out of control in their desperation for information and reassurance . The clerks were handing out and posting as many lists as they could . And finally , Annabelle and her father 's driver , Thomas , went back to the car , to wait for more news . He offered to take her home , but she insisted she wanted to stay , and check the lists as they updated them over the next few hours . There was nowhere else she wanted to be . <p> She sat in the car in silence , some of the time with her eyes closed , thinking about her parents and her brother , willing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on the list so far . She did n't eat or drink all day , and every hour they went back to check . At five o'clock , they were told that the lists of survivors were complete , with the exception of a few young children who could not yet be identified by name . But everyone else that had been picked up by the Carpathia was on the list . <p> " Has anyone been picked up by other ships ? " someone asked . The clerk silently shook his head . Although there were other ships recovering bodies from the freezing waters , the crew of the Carpathia were the only ones who had been able to rescue survivors , mostly in lifeboats , and a very few from the water . Almost all of those in the icy Atlantic had died before the Carpathia arrived , although the rescuers had been on the scene within two hours after the Titanic went down . It was just too long for anyone to survive the frigid temperature of the ocean . <p> Annabelle checked the list one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's name again , but there were no other Worthingtons on the list , neither Arthur nor Robert , and all she could do was pray that it was a mistake . Maybe an oversight , or they were unconscious and could n't say their names to those who were checking . There was no way to get more news than they had . They were told that the Carpathia was due into New York in three days , on the eighteenth . She would just have to keep faith until then , and be grateful for her mother 's survival . She refused to believe that her father and brother were dead . It just could n't be . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
