Denise Fairchild was artificially inseminated in 1997 . She raised her son with her lesbian partner Therese Leach until the couple split in 2001 . Now Fairchild wants to deny her former partner visitation rights , and she 's citing Ohio 's new constitutional ban on gay marriage . Since they were never legally married under Ohio law , Fairchild claims , Leach does not have the rights of a former spouse . Leach 's attorney argues that the amendment does n't apply to parent-child relationships . " I 'm using a piece of legislation that will deny me rights later in life , " Fairchild says . " But before I am a lesbian and a member of the gay community , I am his mother . " <P> Last November Ohio passed one of the nation 's most far-reaching gay-marriage bans . It prohibits not only gay marriage but also any relationship that " intends to approximate " marriage . Now that broad language is being used in an array of unlikely legal cases . Dozens of Ohio men charged with domestic abuse , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which carry stiffer penalties than standard assault charges , no longer apply to them , since they are not married to the women they 're accused of beating . Legal experts fear they may be right . " It 's very clear that this amendment applies to unmarried heterosexual couples as well as homosexual couples , " says Lewis Katz , a criminal-law professor at Case Western Reserve University . " These defense lawyers will try anything to win , " counters Phil Burress , president of the conservative Citizens for Community Values and sponsor of the amendment . But just in case they are successful , Burress is working with lawmakers to draft new domestic-violence laws .  --  By Chris Maag
