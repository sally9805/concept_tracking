This Month 's Mailbox NAME CALLING Thank you for the March " Social Graces " column , " Way Too Familiar ? " by Joan Caraganis Jakobson . When my children were small , some of their friends ' parents assumed that such familiarity was okay with me . However , I 'll never forget how jarring it was to have my daughter 's kindergarten classmate bawl " Hey , Mary " at me . One way to deal with it within the family is to say something like " Anyone can call me Steve , but you are the only one in the world who can call me Grandpa . " MARY W. , Arlington , VA OVATIONS FOR AUDREY After reading the special tribute to Audrey Hepburn in your May issue " Forever Audrey " , I felt completely satisfied . I expected to find another standard tribute that I would gloss over and then pass along for someone else to skim . To my surprise , I found an insightful and perceptive article by Pamela Fiori and was actually moved to tears when I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Robert Wolders.Thank you , Town &; Country , for such a memorable piece on one of the world 's most memorable people . This issue is a keeper ! LlNDA I . , San Francisco , CA A while ago , we indulged in an afternoon of Champagne , pate and Audrey Hepburn movies . As we watched , we were enchanted by her world-one of elegance , culture and enduring beauty . We sat smiling , visiting a friend we never knew . Those smiles resurfaced when we saw the cover of your May issue . As we read , we got to know her even better : as a star , a mother , a humanitarian and a legend . Our thanks to her family and to T &C; for sharing her story with us . Please continue to give us the beauty , the people and the culture that only your magazine can provide . DANIELE G. AND FREDRICK C. , Charlotte , NC Congratulations to Pamela Fiori for the lovely feature on Audrey Hepburn . Unlike Ms. Fiori , I did get to meet her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she passed away , Ms. Hepburn was in Dallas with Robert Wolders for a UNICEF/USA Film Festival benefit . I 've dealt with numerous celebrities , from politicians to entertainers , throughout my twenty-five-plus-year public-relations career , and Ms. Hepburn and Mr. Wolders could not have been more gracious . With all the belly buttons seen among today 's celebrities , finding a touch of class is hard to do . How nice to see true elegance , style and grace . MARTHA T. , Dallas , TX Kudos to Town &; Country for including the photo of Audrey Hepburn in Africa . I 'm sure you could have found an attractive picture from her UNICEF work , but to show her face , distraught and wrinkled , as she holds a dying child reveals so much about her remarkable spirit . RlCK B. , Nashville , TN Hepburn was one of the finest people to come along in Hollywood in many years , and your keeping her memory alive was very special to me . In case you are interested in learning one of the possible stories behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercer , who wrote the lyrics for " Moon River , " lived on Burnside Island , located in coastal Savannah . Like other little boys , Abraham Famble , Jr. , who now works at our church , sold huckleberries to island residents . The boys would ring the doorbell , and neighbors who came to the door would announce , " Here 's our huckleberry friend " - thus , the expression Johnny used in his lyrics.Today I often call Abe my " huckleberry friend " and get a big grin from him . Savannah is very proud of Johnny Mercer.The performing-arts theater at our civic center is named for him . I cross Moon River while driving into Savannah every day and recall Audrey singing that song in such a winsome way . LOBENTA J. , Savannah , GA T &C; and Audrey go hand in hand . What better publication than yours to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of Audrey 's passing . I can sum it up in a single word : class ! I am still mesmerized by her courage and beauty .

QUINN-TESSENTIAL STYLE My heart skipped a beat when I saw the dream house Sally Quinn created " Grey Gardens , " June . For Quinn to have seen past its facade of neglect and lost dreams is astonishing . God bless her for saving a house with a soul from a bygone era . I wish more people would save these beautiful fixtures of time ; until then , there is Grey Gardens .
