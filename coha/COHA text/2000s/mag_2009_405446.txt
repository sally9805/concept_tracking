Published in the July 13 , 2009 issue : SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT : In a story on mental illness , a statistic -- 80% of those who meet criteria for early signs of illness end up with a diagnosis of schizophrenia within 30 months -- should have been credited to a study by Dr. Thomas McGlashan at Yale June 22 . Psychological woes are not your fault . But if there are ways you can keep your body from breaking down , then why not your mind ? . ? We tend to view the brain like an alien that happens to reside in the skull . We see it as unpredictable , ungovernable in ways that other organs are n't . Proper diet , exercise , no smoking -- these will help prevent heart and lung disease . But diseases of the mind ? They strike at will , right ? You just ca n't keep yourself from going crazy . And yet -- what if you can ? The most exciting research in mental health today involves not how to treat mental illness but how to prevent it in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade collectively suggest that the brain is n't so different from , say , the arm : it does n't simply break on its own . In fact , many mental illnesses -- even those like schizophrenia that have demonstrable genetic origins -- can be stopped or at least contained before they start . This is n't wishful thinking but hard science . Earlier this year , the National Academies -- an organization of experts who investigate science for the Federal Government -- released a 500-page report , nearly two years in the making , on how to prevent mental , emotional and behavioral disorders . The report concludes that pre-empting such disorders requires two kinds of interventions : first , because genes play so important a role in mental illness , we need to ensure that close relatives ( particularly children ) of those with mental disorders have access to rigorous screening programs . Second , we must offer treatment to people who have already shown symptoms of illness ( say , a tendency to brood and see the world without optimism ) but do n't meet the diagnostic criteria for a full-scale mental illness ( in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early-detection programs will identify as candidates for mental illness some people who are merely persnickety or shy or eccentric . Some prevention programs even prescribe psychiatric medications , including antipsychotics and antidepressants , to people who are n't technically psychotic or depressed . " This is a big concern , " says Joseph Rogers , founder of the Philadelphia-based National Mental Health Consumers ' Self-Help Clearinghouse . " Because , gee , if you miss , you can really do more harm with some of these drugs than good . " But those who contributed to the National Academies report say preventing the suffering of people with mental illness is worth the risk of some false positives , partly because of the enormous cost of treating mental illness after it 's struck . The National Academies estimates that the total economic cost of mental disorders just among Americans under 25 was $247 billion in 2007 ( There are no such recent figures for all adults , but one 2000 study estimated that in 1992 , the total cost of adult mental illness was $161 billion . ) Another 2007 study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people are incurred in the education and juvenile-justice systems , which must deal with illnesses that , in many cases , could have been prevented . But how do you predict and stop disorders as capricious and varied as depression and schizophrenia ? Though treatment of mental illness is far more costly over time , prevention is n't without up-front costs . In a health-care system already overburdened , who pays ? More fundamentally , what kind of country will we have if we attempt to " cure " various odd behaviors and quirky traits -- qualities that can sometimes look like symptoms of a coming illness and other times look like evidence of a lively mind ? Prevention Pioneer In the early 1970s , before Dr. William McFarlane was one of the world 's top authorities on preventing mental illness , before his hair had thinned and receded to a salt-and-pepper pouf , back when he was a student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City , few psychiatrists talked about prevention . At the time , the U.S. had half a million psychiatric beds ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to move inpatients quickly to outpatient care . Many people spent years on locked wards , their brains slowly gelatinizing from the combination of underlying illness and the blunt-instrument antipsychotic drugs of the day . After he finished school and began seeing patients and teaching , McFarlane , like a few other pioneers , started to wonder if you could do something to stop the cycle before it began . But there was little research at the time on the early stages of mental illness . A key break came in the late 1970s , when a UCLA team began to publish the results of an influential long-term study called the UCLA Family Project . The study found that you could predict , with remarkable accuracy , which 16-year-olds would develop schizophrenia later in life based on only a few characteristics . The teenagers whom the Family Project tracked had already sought treatment for a psychological problem , although the study excluded actively psychotic teens , since it would not have been a surprise if they had developed schizophrenia . Studying such kids for more than a decade , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from families that , when first interviewed , displayed " communication deviance " ( unclear , unintelligible or fragmented speech ) and highly critical and intrusive parenting . These were n't merely families that argued with difficult sons and daughters ; they were families that had lost all ability to cope . McFarlane and others began working with some of the families to address their interactions and teach them how to communicate better -- more slowly , with less anger and intrusion . Even after they are on medication , people with schizophrenia have a difficult time tracking rapid , highly emotional speech , yet that 's the kind they often hear from frustrated family members . These patients would improve in hospitals but relapse once they got home , even when they continued to take antipsychotics . For several years , McFarlane developed and tested the Multi-Family Group approach , which brought several families together at a time to learn from one another how they sounded to outsiders . In twice-monthly sessions , the families modeled greater clarity and compassion and troubleshot daily-living problems like kids ' marijuana use or sexual activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with antipsychotic drugs , worked to reduce schizophrenic relapse rates significantly more than the drugs alone . McFarlane wondered if the treatment could work even earlier , to help prevent the illness in largely asymptomatic kids who were at risk for schizophrenia . Such prediagnosis would not be easy , but McFarlane knew that once a patient 's perception of reality has cracked for the first time , it becomes exceedingly hard to walk back to normality . Indeed , a major study just published in the journal Neuropsychology shows that the signature cognitive problems of schizophrenia -- deficits in verbal learning and memory along with processing speed -- actually begin days or weeks before a first psychotic episode , making the earliest possible detection all the more urgent . And so in the 1980s , McFarlane began canvassing schools in the New York City area to try to get the staffs excited about preventing schizophrenia among their students . A number of the superintendents " practically threw us out the window , " he says . " They just kept saying , ' We do n't have mental illness in our high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , McFarlane knew that each year about 12 in 10,000 young people suffered a first episode of psychosis . Some of the kids were clearly in those schools , but if he could n't get through the door to screen them , he could n't prevent any illness . A Theory Goes Wide Even as McFarlane was exploring his schizophrenia-prevention idea , other researchers were having similar what-if moments with respect to other , more routine conditions . Suppose irritable infants who become fearful toddlers who become shy children somehow could be stopped from becoming adults with anxiety disorders . Suppose men and women who go to war or become cops in inner cities could be helped before developing posttraumatic stress disorder . Could you , similarly , identify the children of depressed parents early and give them skills to prevent their own first depressive episode ? In any given year , approximately 17% of Americans under 25 have a mental , emotional or behavioral disorder . ( Over our lifetime , 46% of us will receive such a diagnosis . ) If we reduce the proportion of young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean about 3.8 million saved each year from what can turn into a lifelong struggle . But if most mental illnesses have a genetic origin , is n't even that modest 25%-reduction goal unlikely ? The science can get tricky here , but the simple answer is that genes are n't destiny . You ca n't do anything to change your genome , but your environment and experiences have powerful effects on the way those genes are expressed . A susceptibility to cancer may remain just a susceptibility -- until you start smoking and kick the disease process into motion . Similarly , change a child 's emotional experiences for the worse and you can trigger mental illness ; change them for the better and you may hush the problem genes . One concrete example of this : in 2003 , a study in Science found that the larger the number of copies an individual carries of a serotonin-transporter gene called 5-HTTLPR the greater the risk of developing major depressive disorder and suicidality -- but only if the individual suffers stressful early-life experiences like abuse . How long is the window between first symptoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several mental illnesses -- including obsessive-compulsive disorder , depression and substance dependence -- we have about two to three years to intervene and keep short-term symptoms from becoming long-term afflictions . Depression offers particularly good evidence of this idea at work . Currently , about 5% of adolescents experience an episode of clinical depression in any given year . Rates of depression are three to four times as high among the children of depressed parents as among those whose parents are n't depressed . Dr. William Beardslee of Children 's Hospital Boston , one of the authors of the National Academies report , has spent more than 25 years studying how some kids of depressed parents avoid the illness , and he has found that resilience is key . The kids who do n't develop depression are " activists and doers , " Beardslee says . Even growing up in the darkness of a depressed home , they muster the capacity to engage deeply in relationships . They also are likelier than other kids to understand that they are n't to blame for their parents ' disorder -- and that they are free to chart their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent depression ? Over the past 17 years , Beardslee 's team has developed an early intervention that targets kids from families in which at least one parent is depressed . Like McFarlane , he uses a family-based approach because a bad home environment tends to be more predictive of adolescent mental illness than dysfunctional peer relationships are . Beardslee 's Family Talk Intervention includes both separate meetings with parents and kids as well as family meetings with social workers or psychologists that focus in part on demystifying depression -- explaining that it is a treatable illness , not a beast that will necessarily crush a family . In a randomized trial , Beardslee found that just seven sessions of this intervention decreased predepression symptoms among the kids and improved the parents ' behavior and attitudes . All this makes kids more resilient . Tackling Schizophrenia McFarlane had n't gotten far with the New York City schools in the 1980s , and his prevention work waned for a few years as he taught at Columbia University and wrote articles on his Multi-Family Group approach to treating psychosis . Eventually , he moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairmanship of Maine Medical Center 's psychiatry department . There , he settled into quieter , less paradigm-changing work . It was n't until 1996 that his prevention work resumed . That year , a team of researchers in Norway -- one that included Dr. Thomas McGlashan of Yale -- approached McFarlane about training therapists to use the Multi-Family Group approach with patients who had just suffered a first psychotic episode . These patients already had the illness , so it was too late for prevention . But the Norwegians had succeeded where McFarlane had failed in New York : they had connected with schools and other local institutions to identify the first signs of psychosis and refer patients to the team immediately . In October 1998 , the picture grew still more promising when NATO sponsored a major psychotic-disorders conference in Prague , where McFarlane learned that several groups around the world , including one in Australia , had also been trying to prevent first episodes of psychosis . He returned from Prague and tried again to set up an early-detection system with schools , this time in Portland . By now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen a dramatic rise in emotional and behavioral problems during the ' 90s . Unlike their New York counterparts , Portland school superintendents welcomed McFarlane . At about the same time , McGlashan 's team at Yale was working on a screening interview that might distinguish kids who would become psychotic from those who would n't . McGlashan tested his questions at various sites in North America , including with teens who sought treatment in McFarlane 's department in Portland . By 2001 , McGlashan and his team had completed their " Structured Interview for Prodromal pre-disease Symptoms " ( SIPS )  - -  a two-hour assessment involving various oral tests and a family history . Those who meet SIPS criteria for risk are about 30 times as likely as the general population to develop a diagnosable psychotic disorder . SIPS allows for the careful scoring of warning signs , some of which are obvious ( hearing mumbling that is n't there ) and some of which are less so ( changing your behavior because of a superstition ) . McFarlane and his team connected with most of Portland 's principals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids who seem slightly off -- prone to jumbled thoughts , maybe even hearing voices -- send them our way . Among those referred to him , McFarlane found that 80% of those who met SIPS criteria for prodromal psychosis would receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia within 30 months . He put kids who met a certain SIPS threshold into Multi-Family Group psychoeducation . At first , he intended not to use drugs with these prediagnosis kids , particularly since the meds can cause side effects like weight gain , acne and uncontrollably shaky legs . But McFarlane found that once symptoms like auditory hallucinations started , he could n't correct them with only psychosocial interventions . ( Today , virtually everyone enrolled in his Portland Identification and Early Referral prevention program is prescribed psychiatric medication . ) The combination of the family approach and drug support seems to be working well . The National Institute of Mental Health is funding a trial of McFarlane 's work , and while he is still writing up his data for publication , his anecdotal results are promising : most of the kids are so far avoiding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly dropped out of high school are going to college and getting jobs . But this approach does n't come cheap . The kids who are enrolled are bombarded with care : social workers help them at school or work ; therapists guide them and their families in individual and group sessions ; a psychiatrist or nurse practitioner carefully calibrates their medication based on response rates and side effects . When members of McFarlane 's clinical team gather each day to discuss cases , they know virtually everything about their kids : they know about boyfriends , girlfriends and summer plans . They know the kids ' grades in English class , how much pot they smoke , what they did on a recent trip to Disneyland . They know whether Dad just lost his job and if Mom 's grandmother killed herself . This is what prevention of mental illness looks like : unwavering , sweeping , complicated . But it works . One Family at a Time The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is so impressed with McFarlane 's program that it has devoted $15 million to its national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative . McFarlane 's approach costs about $3,500 per patient per year , but compare that with the $150,000 a year to care for a hospitalized schizophrenic or severely bipolar patient . Still , not all the kids McFarlane sees can be helped . Patti White is a plainspoken 47-year-old Mainer who works for McFarlane as an administrative coordinator . She has a son who began experiencing psychotic symptoms a few years ago , and he might have seemed like a perfect fit for her boss 's program . He was n't ; prevention is n't that easy . Instead , White 's son Tyler , who turns 20 this month , was too far along in his illness -- eventually diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder , a relative of schizophrenia -- to benefit from prevention therapy . A social worker on McFarlane 's team helped Tyler get into treatment , and he is doing better and holding down a job in food service . But White has another son , Jacob , who causes her to worry . A few months ago , Jacob , 10 , started to withdraw . He was getting paranoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none existed . And even though White works for one of the world 's leading prevention experts , she at first resisted having Jacob take the SIPS test . " If his brother had had diabetes , I would n't have thought twice about having Jacob screened for diabetes , " she says . " But I just could n't deal with the idea that another one of my kids would have "  - -  she pauses --  " this enormous thing . " Three weeks ago , Jacob took SIPS . The good news : he showed no red flags for psychosis . He does have depressive symptoms and is now taking a low dose of Prozac to help prevent a full-blown depression . But for Jacob -- and millions of other Americans with all manner of mental ills -- intervention can now come in time . Stopping Mental Illness Before It Even Starts . Most psychological conditions do n't strike overnight . Staying mindful of the warning signs -- and taking smart prevention steps -- may keep you well This article contains a table .
