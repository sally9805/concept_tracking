INSPIRED BY HIS FATHER 'S AFFINITY FOR ANIMALS , CALIFORNIA WINEMAKER SAM SEBASTIANI FLOODED A HAYFIELD AT HIS SONOMA VINEYARD AND BROUGHT A WETLAND BACK TO LIFE . One winter day in 1988 , Sam Sebastiani climbed a hill in California 's wine country and searched the horizon for a new beginning . He was prospecting for a winery site , having lost control of his wine business in a family power struggle . The Sonoma County hilltop looked promising . The property had a run of the red soil Sebastiani wanted for his vines , and he liked the view : Westward stood the Carneros Hills . Eastward lay the Sonoma floodplain . Directly beneath the hilltop was the yellow stubble of a marginal hayfield . The hayfield was a fossil marsh that possessed the hydric soil characteristic of former wetlands . Had Sebastiani descended with a shovel , he would have uncovered the seeds of marsh sedges and the rhizomes of bulrushes and cattails , dormant here for a century . Sebastiani saw a kind of mirage . The field flooded in his imagination , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bulrushes , with swans and geese and mallards and pintails swimming beneath the reeds . The mirage was refracted light from Sams childhood . Growing up , his life was equal parts vines and birds , for those had been the passions of his father , August Sebastiani . " You either have an affinity for animals , or you do n't , and my father had it . Especially for birds , " says Sam Sebastiani . " When he was little , he would catch birds , raise them for a while , then let them go . When he was 15 or 16 , he read about the passenger pigeon going extinct . To have millions of birds that darken the sky go to zero ! It focused his passion for birds . " As vocation , August built Sebastiani Vineyards into one of the biggest wine producers in the United States . As avocation , he became a savior of birds . He started with waterfowl , which were the species at hand . When Sonoma Valley farmers came across duck nests while harvesting , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , who would take the eggs home for incubation by chickens in pens of his own design . August would rear the ducklings and release them into the wild . Sam Sebastiani 's job as a boy was to clean the pens . By 16 , he was driving a harvester in the summer and bringing eggs to his father , who had built a duck pond at the vineyard . August then expanded to geese , then to swans , then back full circle to his inspiration , the Columbidae , the family of the passenger pigeon . Endangered pigeons and doves from all over Oceania and Asia , after 45 days of quarantine in Hawaii , streamed from Honolulu to aviaries at Sebastiani 's vineyards . " If there were any birds going extinct and you needed someone to care for them , my father was your man , " says Sam . " By species count , he was the world 's largest dove breeder-more than 80 species . In fact , he overshot it a bit . It turns out that a lot of the doves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out 80 cages worth of grain , but if you have to put out fruit , too , it becomes much more complicated . My mother was always cooking for the birds . " Finally Sylvia Sebastiani put her foot down , and August was forced to phase out the fruit eaters . Word went out across the tiny islands of Oceania and the rain forests of Indochina : Send me your weak , your endangered , but grain eaters only . Many years later , Sylvia put her foot down again . When August died , Sam became president of Sebastiani Vineyards . Embarking on a campaign to gentrify his company 's jug-wine image and modernize the Sebastiani plant , Sam invested in expensive new equipment from France , but he failed to keep his 80-year-old mother  --  who was chairwoman of the board-up to date . On New Year 's Day 1986 , she fired him . Two years later he found himself on that Sonoma hilltop , looking to begin all over again . Sam built a facsimile Tuscan villa on the hilltop-a little Italian hill town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian marketplace run by his wife , Vicki . With bulldozers , he raised a 1,700-foot-long levee on the northern border of his land . Winter rains fell and ponded behind the levee . Cattails , bulrushes , and sedges sprang from the dormant seed bank . Pondweed and the seeds of spike rushes and other marsh vegetation washed in on high water or hitched rides in the plumage of birds . Viansa Wetlands , as Sebastiani calls his little reserve , was born . To date , 156 species of bird have been recorded in or around the wetlands . On a single winter day , 10,000 waterfowl were counted on its 90 acres . Nearly every North American duck species has paid a visit . There are two casts of characters in Sebastiani 's marsh . The first , a small local repertory group , lives there yearround , or nearly so . Coots , common moorhens , pied  --  billed grebes , ruddy ducks , gadwalls , cinnamon teal , avocets , black-necked stilts , and killdeer all court , nest , and rear their young in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has built around the margins of his marsh , and red-tailed hawks and three species of owl nest there . On the hillside above the marsh , coyotes sometimes dig dens . Opossums , raccoons , skunks , and badgers live here , too . The second , much larger cast of characters is composed of itinerant players : white pelicans , osprey , harriers , kites , falcons , arctic ducks , and legions of shorebirds that march , spindle-legged and in quick time , along the marsh margins . Today Sam Sebastiani gives talks to growers and to waste-water  --  management people , showing slides of his marsh . He advises his colleagues against building tank farms to clean their water . " Make a wetland to clean it instead ! " he tells them . " Because then you 've created more life . When you get in your car to go home and you see a bird fly by , you 'll know that there 's a good chance you helped put that bird on the planet .
