Zanesville By Kris Saknussemm Random House Kris Saknussemm He crashed back into himself and felt the Easter evening damp . Dolls and chains hung in ritual fashion from the branches surrounding him , and through the knife-hacked oak trees he could make out great luminous spires and domes , and older , grim , but luxuriant blocks of apartments sealed with steel-plate louvers as if against attack . Beside these rose skeletal scaffoldings on which , judging from the hives of lights , whole families perched on open-air platforms while resourceful or desperate individuals dangled in slings and sacks suspended from guy wires . Across the sky , as though projected from behind the sulfur-tinged clouds , flashed pictograms and iridescent banks of hypertext . The word vitessawas repeated often . . . and slogans like efram-zev . . . the right mood at the right time.He felt hypnotized by the messages , information raining down like some new kind of radiation .

It reminded him of a childhood story but he could n't pin it down . Then he realized that of much greater concern was that he could n't remember where he was . It was a park of some kind , a vast shadowy garden in some siren-filled city . But which one ? He heard a voice . . . garbled and yet unnaturally clear , seeming to come from inside his head . I 'll take Manhattan . It was a man 's voice , both far away and far too close . What did that mean . . . to takeManhattan ? He tried to shake himself out of his haze . Something terrible had happened . Drugs , head injury . " I do n't remember my name ! " he said aloud , and felt his heart pound at the implication . Even his clothes seemed strange . . . navy cotton drawstring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been to wall drug , and a cream-colored windbreaker with a logo on the chest that showed a wheelbarrow with flames rising out of it . Judging from the grime and odor he might have been sleeping in the bushes for several nights . But Manhattan meant New York , that much he did think was right . Was that where he was ? All he could bring to mind was waking with a start with some intuition of danger . Then he heard what he could n't decide was the same voice or another and glanced around frantically . It said , For I came down from heaven , not to do mine will , but the will of him who sent me . Shit , he thought . I 'm hallucinating . Then a sudden deep sense of alarm brought his whole being alive . There was another sound in the outer darkness . Someone or something was approaching . Seeking him out .

Out of the black maw they emerged at last , one on a large chestnut horse , the other on a bay . The horses were shielded with synthetic face and chestplates , while the riders wore old-fashioned NYPD uniforms . When the figures stopped , he could see that they did n't have faces . Just flat sheets with scanner slits . Up close , in the sodium lights , the scan masks were scraped and cloudy . From the south came bursts of gunfire and thudding low-frequency music , but here it was quiet enough to hear their echolocation sonar . His heart bounced as he smelled the tense , strangely sweet animal scent of the horses . At last a flare of static passed between the two mounted shapes . Then , just as they 'd appeared , they moved on , the horses ' hooves striking the asphalt with a timeless Roman rhythm , their imposing silhouettes fading into the trees . The moment they were past , from behind one of the spraypainted boulders , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt out . " Yer ass is lucky , " the shadow said , grabbing one of his hands in a neoprene fighting glove -- weaving through a labyrinth of stripped cars and barbed-wire effigies . They looked like origami contrasted with the turrets rising above the park , armorguard facets gleaming like reptilian crystals . " Hurry , " his guide called out . " Meter says you gon na have a meltdown . " The darkness became a membrane of endlessly falling slowmotion snow , only the flakes were like glass faces , painfully intricate but beautiful to behold . " This way ! " the figure called , and it was like stepping through a wall of cool white light . Suddenly , all around were people . He felt a dart of warmth hit his arm . Then he fell , and he seemed to keep falling , or rising , as if he 'd been taken up inside a whirlwind , faces and disintegrated memories orbiting around him . A whirlwind , he remembered . I came here by whirlwind . When at last the spinning stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him was a large black woman who , as his eyes began to focus , he came to see was in fact a man , wearing makeup , an aqua wig , and a long African-style robe over sheepskin boots from which a Beretta Cheetah was just visible . " We 've given you some ZENO , " the vision informed him . " Try not to move fast . " He was lying in a tent on an old cot . Candles glowed . Through a gelpane window he could see people passing between radomes and tepees . He heard an accordion and smelled marsala . Sparks rose from oil drums . " Yo , " a voice behind him said , and he saw it was the tape-mailed figure who 'd found him minus the night-vision helmet -- a Puerto Rican girl of about sixteen with a pigskin face graft that suggested a dark market burn ward . " Who are you ? " the large black woman/man asked . He tried to focus . He could n't get over his long blond hair . There was n't an ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscle , his skin was smooth . Except for the terrible burning he felt now on his back . That 's what made me black out , he realized . Pain . Pain from the skin of my back . There was something there but he could n't bring himself to think of it . Voices rustled in his brain . . . Last hope . . . Psyche War . . . beneath the sadness of a blues guitar drifting in on the night wind from somewhere far away -- or deeper inside himself . " Do you know who you are ? " the large black woman/man repeated , but he could n't answer . Who were these people and what did they want ? Where had he been going when he fell out of the whirlwind ? To meet someone , he thought . To find someone . There 's somewhere I have to be . There 's someone I have to be . " That 's all right , " the dark-skinned giant said .

" So saying , the speaker brought over a psykter of purified water and poured a cup for him , carefully considering the man 's whiteblond hair and tomorrow-staring eyes . There was something intriguingly familiar and at the same time deeply foreign about this night visitor . He was of average height and certainly less than average weight , but he radiated a presence that filled the tent . The man drank some water and said , " You 're a --  " " A drag queen ? That 's right , honey , I am ! " In fact the speaker looked like a former linebacker trying very hard to imitate some forgotten disco singer like Donna Summer . " Used to be a lawyer .

" Is someone after you ? " Aretha asked , noticing again how long and blond the odd man 's hair was , how outwardly strained and yet internally resilient he appeared . " I do n't know . . . I ca n't . . . " Aretha picked up a detector and ran it over him . The device recorded an electromagnetic disturbance of an unknown kind . " So do you have any idea who you are ? " " N-no . I . . . do n't . . . , " the man said , staring around at the walls of the tent , which he saw through the gloom were decorated with chintzy Chinese fans , kimonos , and ostrich feathers . " And you do n't know how you got here ? " Aretha prodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy idea of falling out of a whirlwind all he remembered was staring at the syringes in the fountain and then being seized with a scorching pain across his back .
