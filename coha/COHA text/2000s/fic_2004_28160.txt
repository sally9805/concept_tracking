THE DAY started to go a little crazy when Keith Duffy and his young daughter brought that poor crushed doe to the Inn-Patient , as I call my small animal hospital in Bear Bluff , Colorado , about fifty minutes northwest of Boulder along the " Peak-to-Peak " highway . Sheryl Crow was singing ever so raucously on the tape deck . I flipped saucy Sheryl off when I saw Duffy walk inside carrying that poor doe , standing like a dolt in front of Abstraction , White Rose II , my current favorite Georgia O'Keeffe poster . I could see the badly injured doe was pregnant . She was wild-eyed and thrashing when Duffy hefted her onto the table . Half-thrashing , in truth , because I suspected her spine was broken at midpoint , where she 'd been clipped by the Chevy 4x4 that Duffy drives . The little girl was sobbing and her father looked miserable . I thought he was going to break down , too . " Money 's no object , " he said . And money was no object because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fawn , however , was a maybe . If the mother was close to term . If it had n't been mashed too badly by the four-thousand-pound truck . And a few more ifs besides . " I ca n't save the doe , " I said to the girl 's father . " I 'm sorry . " Duffy nodded . He was a local builder , and also one of the local hunters . A real knucklehead , in my humble opinion . Thoughtless probably described him best , and maybe that was his best quality . I could only imagine how he must be feeling now , this man who usually bragged on his kill , with his little girl begging to save the animal 's life . Among his other bad habits , Duffy occasionally stopped by and brazenly hit on me . A sticker on his 4x4 bumper read : Support Wildlife . Throw a Party . " The fawn ? " he asked . " Maybe , " I said . " Help me get her gassed down and we 'll see . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kicked at the pedal and the halothane hissed through the tube . The doe 's brown eyes showed terror , but also unimaginable sadness . She knew . The little girl grabbed the doe around the belly and started crying her heart out . I liked the girl a lot . Her eyes showed spunk and character . Duffy had done at least one good thing in his life . " Damn , damn , " the father said . " I never saw her until she was on the hood . Do your best , Frannie , " he said to me . I gently peeled the little girl off the deer . I held on to her shoulders and made her face me . " What 's your name , sweetie ? " " Angie , " she sobbed out . " Angie , now listen to me , sweetheart . The doe does n't feel anything now , understand ? It 's painless for her . I promise you . " Angie pushed her face into my body and held me with all of her little-girl strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to euthanatize the doe , but if its baby could be saved , there would be a lot of work to do . " Please , please , please , " said Angie . " You 're going to need a goat . For milk , " I said to Duffy . " Maybe two or three of them . " " Not a problem , " he said . He would have acquired nursing elephants if I 'd told him to . He just wanted his little girl to smile again . I then asked both of them to please get out of the exam room and let me work . What I was about to do was a bloody , difficult , and ugly operation . Chapter Two IT WAS SEVEN in the evening when the Duffys came to the Inn-Patient , and maybe twelve minutes had already gone by . The poor doe was out cold and I felt so bad for her . Frannie the Sap  --  that 's what my sister , Carole , calls me . It was my husband David 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and a half ago , David was shot and killed in the physician 's parking lot at Boulder Community Hospital . I still had n't recovered from that , had n't grieved enough . It would have helped if the police had caught David 's murderer , but they had n't . I cut along the abdominal line with my scalpel . I exteriorized the uterus , flipping it out intact onto the doe 's open belly . I cut again , this time through the uterine wall . I pulled out the fawn , praying I was n't going to have to put it down . The fawn was about four months , nearly to term , and as best as I could tell , uninjured . I gently cleaned the babe 's air passages with my fingers and fitted a tiny mask over its muzzle . Then I cranked on the oxygen . The fawn 's chest shuddered . It started to breathe . Then it bawled . God , what a glorious sound . New life . Jeez , Louise , the whole magical thing still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood had spattered on my face during the surgery , and I wiped it off with my sleeve . The fawn was crying into the oxygen mask and I let the little orphan snuggle up against its mother for a few moments , just in case deer have souls , just in case ... let mother say good-bye to her child . Then I clamped off the cord , filled a syringe , and euthanatized the doe . It was fast . She never knew the moment she passed from life into death . There was one can of goat 's milk in the fridge . I filled a bottle and popped it into the microwave for a few seconds to warm . I removed the oxygen mask and slipped the nipple into the baby deer 's mouth , and it began to suck . The fawn was really beautiful , with the gentlest brown eyes . God , I love what I do sometimes . Father and daughter were huddled close together on my antique daybed when I came out into the waiting room . I handed the fawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a girl . " I walked the family of three out to their creased and dented 4x4 . I gave them the can of goat 's milk , my phone number , and waved good-bye . I briefly considered the irony that the fawn was riding home in the same vehicle that had killed its mother . Then I was thinking of a steaming hot bath , a cool glass of Chardonnay , maybe a baked potato with Wisconsin Cheddar  --  life 's little rewards . I was feeling kind of proud of myself . I had n't felt that way for a long time , not since David 's death changed just about everything in my life . I was about to go inside when I realized that there was a car in the lot , a shiny black Jeep Cherokee . The door opened and a man slowly got out . Headlights hit him from behind and for a moment he was haloed in light . He was tall , slender , but muscular , with lots of blond hair . His eyes quickly took in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a couple of wind socks . My trusty-dusty mountain bike . Wildflowers everywhere  --  mountain lupine , daisies , Indian paintbrush . Now this part is more than a little weird . I 'd never seen him before . But my limbic brain , a dumb little organ so primitive it bypasses logical thought , locked on to his image and stayed there . I stared at him , and I felt a rush of something akin to recognition . And my heart , which has been stone-dead for the past few years , sputtered , caught , and jumped into life for at least a couple of seconds . That kind of ticked me off , actually . I figured that whoever he was , the mystery man was lost . " We 're closed for the night , " I said . He stared at me , unapologetic about the intrusion into my front yard . Then he called me by name . " Dr. O'Neill ? " " Does she owe you money ? " I said . It was an old Comedy Store line , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke after the euthanasia of the doe . He smiled , and his light blue eyes brightened , and I found that I could n't look away from them . " Are you Frances O'Neill ? " " Yeah . It 's Frannie , though . " I took in a face that was cool yet had a touch of warmth . The directness of his eyes sort of nailed me to the spot . He had a fine nose , a strong chin . His features held together too damned well . A dash of Tom Cruise , maybe even a little Harrison Ford . Something like that , or so it seemed that night in the bloom of the Jeep 's headlights . He brushed off his slouchy hat , and a lot of sandy-blond hair shifted and gleamed . Then he was standing in front of me , all six two of him , like a glossy photo from an L. L. Bean catalog , or maybe Eddie Bauer 's . Very serious-looking , though . " I 've come from Hollander and Cowell . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did I catch you at a bad time ? " he asked . " Sorry . " At least he was polite . " What makes you think that ? " I asked . I was all too aware that my jeans were soaked in blood . My sweatshirt looked like a Jackson Pollock painting . " I 'd hate to see the guy who lost the fight , " he said , surveying my appearance . " Or do you dabble in witchcraft ? " " Some people call it veterinary medicine , " I said . " So , what 's this about ? Why did Hollander and Cowell send you at this time of night ? " He hooked a thumb toward Bear Bluff 's center , where the real estate office is . " I 'm your new tenant . I signed the papers this afternoon . They said you left everything in their capable hands . " " You 're kidding . You rented my cabin ? " I 'd almost forgotten I 'd put the cabin on the block . It 's a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it used to be a hunting shack until David and I moved in . After David died , I started sleeping in a small room at the clinic . A whole lot of things changed for me back then , none of them good . " So ? Can I see the place ? " L. L. Bean said . " Just follow the footpath behind the clinic , " I told him . " It 's a four- or five-minute walk . It 's worth it . Door 's not locked . " " I do n't get the guided tour ? " he asked . " Much as I 'd love to , I 've still got a couple of chickens to kill and some spells to cast before I sleep . I 'll get you a flashlight  - -  -  " " I 've got one in the car , " he said . I lingered in the doorway as he crunched back to his Jeep . He had a nice way of walking . Confident , not too cocky . " Hey , " I called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked back  --  hesitated for a half second . " Kit , " he finally said . " I 'm Kit Harrison . " Chapter Three I WILL NEVER FORGET what happened next . It was such a shock for me , a hard kick in the stomach , or maybe even the side of my head . Kit Harrison reached into the Jeep  --  and he did the unspeakable  --  he pulled a hunting rifle off a silver-metallic gun rack . That son of a bitch . I could n't believe what I was seeing . My flesh crept . I yelled at him , loudly , which is so unlike me . " Wait ! Hey ! You ! Wait right there , mister ! Hold up ! " He turned to face me . The look on his face was serene , cool as it had been . " What ? " he said . Was he challenging me ? Did he dare ? " Listen . " I let the big screen door bang shut behind me and marched fast and hard across the gravel beachhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hunting rifle on my land . No way ! Not in his or my lifetime . " I 've changed my mind . This is no good . It 's not going to work . You ca n't stay here . No hunters . No how , no way ! " His gaze returned to the Jeep 's interior . He snapped the glove compartment shut . Locked it . He did n't seem to be listening to me at all . " Sorry , " he said without looking at me . " We made a deal . " " The deal 's off ! Did n't you just hear me ? " " Nope . A deal 's a deal , " he said . He grabbed a torch lamp from inside the car door , a reddish duffel bag , then he took up the hideous rifle in his other hand . I was apoplectic , kept sputtering , " Look here . " But he ignored me , did n't seem to hear a word . He kicked the Jeep door shut , flicked on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . The woods sucked up the light and the sound of his retreating footsteps . My blood was knocking hard and fast against my eardrums . A goddamn hunter was staying in my house .
