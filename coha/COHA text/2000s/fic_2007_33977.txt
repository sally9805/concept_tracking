Cate Madigan had mentally stripped the guy across the table from her , and he 'd come up short in every possible way . Cate had n't actually wanted to see him naked . The image had just popped into her head . One of those awful moments of too much information ! The guy 's name was Patrick Pugg , and he was the Madigan family 's pick of the week for a boyfriend for Cate . Cate and Pugg were seated at the Madigan 's chaotic dinner table , where the rule had always been every man for himself . Things had calmed down some since Cate 's brothers Matt and Tom had moved out , but dinner here was still a harrowing experience . . . in a good Boston Irish kind of way . There were eight people at the table tonight . Cate , Patrick Pugg , Cate 's parents Margaret and Jim Madigan , Cate 's older brother Danny , Danny 's wife Amy , and their six-year-old twin girls , Zoe and Zelda . The Madigans were all stereotypical Irish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with length , brown eyes , a stubborn streak , and a natural bent toward practical jokes . The men were chunky and fought flat-footed . The women were slim and preferred getting even to getting mad . Amy was the single frosted cupcake in the box of jelly doughnuts . She did n't look at all like aMadigan . Amy was the all-American cheerleader with blond hair , blue eyes , and smiley personality . Amy grew up half a block away and , from what Cate knew , Amy and Danny had been together since they were two years old . " You look all wrinkle-head , " Zoe said to Cate . " What are you thinking about ? " " I was thinking about work , " Cate said . " I need to go in early tonight . " This was a big fat lie , of course . Cate had been unconsciously grimacing at the thought of a naked Pugg . At five foot six inches he looked eye to eye at Cate . He was n't bad looking , but he was n't great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hair crept from the cuffs of his shirt and spilled over his collar . He had long sideburns and a pompadour on the top of his head with a single curl pasted to his forehead . He was a car-crash cross between Elvis Presley and Squiggy from Laverne and Shirley . And he had a horrifying habit of referring to himself as Pugg . " Pugg likes this pot roast , " Pugg said to Cate 's mother . " Pugg would like to find a woman to marry who could make a pot roast like this . " Cate 's mother beamed at Cate . " Cate makes a wonderful pot roast , " she said . " Do n't you , Cate ? " Cate blew out a sigh and forked up some mashed potatoes . She 'd gouge out her eye with a rusted spoon before she 'd make a pot roast for Pugg . " Green beans , " Cate 's father said at the head of the table , and an arm reached across Cate for the bean bowl . Food was circulating at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner rolls , the butter dish , the green beans , the meat platter , the monster bowl of mashed potatoes . This was normal behavior at the Madigan dinner table , and over the years Cate had perfected the technique of passing with her left hand and simultaneously eating with her right . " I heard the Sox are trading five guys , " Danny said . Cate 's dad shoveled pot roast onto his plate . " Bull crap . " " I got something brown on my dress , " Zelda said . " It smells like dookey . " " It 's gravy , " Amy said . " Do n't worry about it . " " I do n't like it . Make it go away . " " Dookey dress , dookey dress , dookey dress , " Zoe said . " Patrick sells tires , " Cate 's mother said to Cate . " He 's the top salesman at his dealership . " Patrick Pugg winked at Cate . " Pugg is good at selling . Pugg is good at lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " Cate said . " What do you mean ? " Danny was seated next to Cate . You 're baiting him , " Danny said . " This is going to get ugly . " " Pugg 's wounded , " Pugg said . " Cate doubts Pugg 's romantic virtuosity . " Danny stared openmouthed at Pugg for a beat . " Wounded ? Romantic virtuosity ? Who the heck are you ? What are you ? " " I 'm Pugg . " " Oh boy , " Danny said . He slid an arm across the back of Cate 's chair and leaned toward her . " Do n't worry . I have a banker I want you to meet . I have it all set . " Patrick Pugg did a little finger wag at Danny . " Pugg would n't like that . Pugg is committed to making this relationship work . " Danny narrowed his eyes . " Did I miss something ? I thought you just met Cate tonight . " " Yes , but Cate likes Pugg , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone stopped eating and looked at Cate . For the past six years Cate had been tending bar and working her way through college , inching closer to her goal of teaching grade school . Cate had always thought teaching second graders would be easy after living with three volatile brothers and tending bar . It was her observation that her older brothers , men in bars , and very young children had many things in common . . . for instance , they all from time to time exhibited inappropriate behavior , and they were all easily distracted . If Cate told Pugg she wanted nothing more to do with him , he 'd sulk through the rest of the dinner . If she told Pugg she liked him , Danny would sulk through dinner . So Cate did the only sensible thing . . . she accidentally on purpose tipped her water glass and jumped out of her seat when the water splashed everywhere . " Shoot , " Cate said . " Just look at this mess . I 'm so sorry . " And she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , " Danny whispered when she returned . " It 's a classic . " " It 's all your fault . You caused that confrontation . " " Did not . " " Did so . " " Did not . Anyway , wait until you see the banker . He 's light-years away from this moron . You 're gon na like the banker . " " No . No more fix ups . I hate fix ups . " " I would n't have to get you fixed up if you were better at getting dates . " " I do n't have time for dates right now . " " You 're not getting any younger , " Danny said . " I 'm twenty-six ! " " I worry about you , " Danny said . " We all worry about you . We do n't like you working in the bar , coming home at all hours , dealing with drunks all night long . You should be married to some nice boring guy who takes care of you and keeps you safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a nice boring guy . I want to teach school , and I want to marry an exciting guy who rides in on a big black horse and sweeps me off my feet . " " I 'd feel better if he could ride in on a white horse , " Danny said . " Why do n't you at least get a better job ? Something that does n't dump you out at midnight . " " The bar is perfect . It pays well . It allows me to go to school during the day . And I 'm good with the drinks and the customers . All those years of listening to everyone talk at once at the table are finally paying off . " Not to mention Cate was getting cheap rent because she was subletting a room from Marty Longfellow . Marty was a South End drag queen who sang at the bar and single-handedly pulled it out of economic disaster . Not only was Marty a fascinating oddity . . . she was also good . She had a voice like velvet and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of makeup , a half hour to strap herself down and squirm into her dress , she was every woman 's envy and every man 's dream ( at least on the surface ) . Marty sang at the bar two nights a week and traveled the other five , mostly doing private parties . Sometimes she would leave on an extended tour and be gone for a week or two . This was why Cate got the cheap rent . Cate guarded the castle . Cate watered Marty 's plants , retrieved the mail , answered the phone , and made sure things were spiffy for Marty 's return . The perfect living arrangement , Cate thought . It allowed her to go through school without education loans . It got her out from under her parents ' overprotective wings . And she had a big strong roommate who was n't interested in women . Cate mixed two mojitos . It was late summer and that meant exotic-drink season . Lots of margaritas and pia coladas and mojitos . A man at the end of the bar caught Cate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mojitos off to a waiter and sailed a Sam Adams draft down the polished mahogany bar . ESPN played on the television hanging over Cate 's head . Conversation rose and fell in the dark room . Eyes occasionally flicked to the small , empty stage . Marty was expected to start another set in just a few minutes . Sunday night at Evian 's Bar and Grill . Packed with regulars , plus one new guy at the end of the bar , staring at Cate . " Okay ? " Cate mouthed to him . He nodded and moved his hand in the hold sign over his draft . Marty took the stage and there was a lot of hooting and clapping and yelling . " Are n't you the shit ? " Marty said to the crowd . That led to more hooting and clapping . Marty was six foot in heels . She was wearing a red sequined dress and a matching feather boa . She had a bunch of wigs , and tonight she 'd chosen to have short black hair . Her red glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and fluttery and exaggerated for effect . Gina Makin sidled up to Cate . Gina worked nights when Marty performed and extra help was needed . She had a husband and a one-year-old at home , and she was a primo bartender . " She 's wearing the Judy Garland wig tonight , " Gina said . " I 'll bet you five bucks she opens with Over the Rainbow . ' " Marty 's keyboard wrangler , Slow Joe Flagler , banged out " The Wicked Witch is Dead " and Marty gave him the finger . Slow Joe grinned and went into " Over the Rainbow . " " The hot guy nursing the beer at the end of the bar is staring at you , " Gina said to Cate . " Do you know him ? " " No . He 's new . " " You should go flirt with him . He looks like fun . " " Think I 'll pass on that . I 've had about all the fun I can handle for one night , " Cate said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to kiss me when I left for work , I instinctively kneed him in the groin , and he said he liked a feisty woman . " " Obviously you did n't knee him hard enough . " " Seemed pretty hard to me . He went down to the floor and rolled around some before he said I was feisty . " Gina 's attention was fixed on the hot guy . " Did he look like him ? " " Not even a little , " Cate said . The guy at the end of the bar was fine . Black hair , styled short , but long enough from its last cut to wave a little over his ears and fall onto his forehead . Nice mouth , dark eyes , broad shoulders . He had his button-down shirtsleeves rolled to his forearms . Clearly he had some muscle . He caught her looking and his face creased into a full-on smile showing big-bad-wolf-perfect white teeth . Cute , Kellen McBride thought , readjusting his former opinion of Cate Madigan . She looked like she should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing dress of emerald green , waiting for a knight in shining armor . He 'd been watching her refill glasses and mingle with the regulars and had reached the conclusion that she was confident , spirited , and in control . This dragged a mental sigh out of Kellen . Cate Madigan was not the type who would ever need rescuing . She would make the dragon into a pet , defeat the villain , and use the moat of fire to bake cookies . Cate was , in a single word , enchanting . And the second word that came to mind might be intimidating . Not that any of this mattered . Kellen had a plan , and he was sticking to it until something better came along . He was going to finesse himself into Cate Madigan 's life . Kellen did a little come here crook with his finger , aimed at Cate . " Me ? " Cate mouthed . " Lucky you , " Gina said . " He 's delicious . " Cate added to the tab for one of her regulars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do for you ? " Cate asked . " Another draft ? Bar menu ? " " It 's what I can do for you , " he said . " Tai mina fhear chun tusa a thogail on gnathsaol . " This got a bark of laughter from Cate . " Okay , I 'm impressed . This is the first time I 've had a guy try to pick me up in Gaelic . " " Seemed appropriate . Do a lot of men try to pick you up ? " " No . I look like everyone 's little sister . Mostly people try to get Marty 's attention . And I know the translation to your Gaelic pickup line . You said I 'm the man to take you away from everyday life . I appreciated the sentiment , but I actually like my everyday life . . . and sorry , I do n't date customers . " Plus her mother 's words echoed in her ears . If a man is too easy on the eyes , he 's likely to be hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma . Was she supposed to actually look for an ugly man ? " I have very good references , " Mr. Hot Guy told her . " And my name is Kellen McBride . Your Irish father would love me . " " You are n't the banker , are you ? " " If I said yes what would it get me ? " Cate did an eye roll and moved to the other end of the bar to refill a wine glass .
