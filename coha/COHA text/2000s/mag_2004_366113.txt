In When Nothing Else Matters : Michael Jordan 's Last Comeback ( Simon &; Schuster ; 435 pages ) , Michael Leahy , who spent two years covering His Airness 's disappointing tenure as player  --  general manager with the Washington Wizards , argues that Jordan 's on-court performance in D.C. wo n't taint his legacy . ( At 40 , he averaged 20 points a game . ) But in the locker room and executive suite , explains Leahy , the game 's greatest player tossed an airball . Jordan ran the Wizards from distant Chicago and hired cronies . And once , after Jerry Stackhouse hit a buzzer shot to give the Wizards a win , Jordan credited himself for drawing the defense 's attention . Wan na be like Mike ? Not when it comes to management .  --  By Sean Gregory
