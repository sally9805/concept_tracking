Headnote Use this guide to create a beautiful and well-kept yard that 's safe for kids and pets , inviting to wildlife , and free of risky chemicals , yet still no worry to your neighbors . A manicured lawn punctuated by a few common evergreen shrubs and accessorized with an orderly planting of all-too-familiar annual flowers : That 's the look of most yards you see , is n't it ? But as an organic gardener , you 'd like a different kind of landscape-one that uses few resources and no toxic treatments , provides food and habitat for wildlife , is adapted to the natural forces of wind and water , demands little time for maintenance , and truly connects your home to its natural environment . Yet you also must beware of drawing the ire of your neighbors or even , in many suburbs , violating the residentsassociation rules . So we asked landscapers in different parts of the country who are creating natural-looking properties about small but significant changes you can make to transform your yard into an organic oasis . Lawn Reduction Improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate your lawn and allow weeds to grow out of control . Instead , take these steps to establish and care for a low-maintenance , ecofriendly lawn . Hold the lawn-care chemicals . Weed-killing herbicides and synthetic lawn fertilizers are as much of a contributor to environmental degradation as the chemicals used on farms , if not more . And these toxic treatments have been linked to increased risk of cancer in dogs that romp on lawns where they are used . If that 's not reason enough to kick the lawn-chemical habit , consider that they are expensive and cause the grass to grow faster , sucking up your time as well as your money . Diminish the size of your lawn . " Minimizing a lawn and creating a more natural yard is n't an all-or-nothing proposition , " says Michael Nadeau , co-owner of Plantscapes , a landscape design and build firm in Fairfield , Connecticut . " Just do a little bit at a time . Keep the lawn where it is needed-as a play area or around a pool , for instance . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low-maintenance planting regimes . When the kids grow up , convert the play areas , too . Build a buffer . A visible way to demonstrate to your neighbors that you are still caring for your yard is to keep 20 feet of manicured lawn along the road and any properties adjacent to yours . Plant better grass . Reseed the most " public " areas of your lawn with low-maintenance grasses that are suited to your conditions . Turf-type fescues and perennial rye grass , for instance , require less care than Kentucky bluegrass . Buffalo-grass is a slow-growing option where summers are hot and dry . Bermudagrass and zoysia thrive in Southern landscapes . If your lawn has been plagued by surface-feeding insects , such as chinch bugs , sod webworms , or fall armyworms , look for grass seed that is " endophyte enhanced " - it contains fungi that are naturally toxic to the pests but harm nothing else . Replace grass out of sight . Where your lawn is more private than public , seed it with birdsfoot trefoil and Dutch white clover , low-growing plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " fixing " it in the Rhizobium-filled nodules on their roots . Go with the Flow " In the next few decades , water conservation will not be optional , " warns Dan Eskelson , owner of Clearwater Landscapes , in Priest River , Idaho . Lawns typically absorb only 15 percent of the rainfall they receive - the rest is runoff . For these reasons , Eskelson and other natural-landscape experts recommend that you carefully observe how and where water flows on your property and adapt your landscape to it . Use these ideas to get started . Get ready for rain . In low areas where water accumulates , establish " rain gardens , " or islands of plants and trees that tolerate periodic inundation . Generally , the more biomass a plant has , the more water it soaks up . Guide the gushing . On slopes where rainfall gushes down , fill the gullies the water carves out with small stones to slow and direct the flow . Prepare for drought . In the Southwest and other areas where rainfall is sparse , plant drought-tolerant species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulch to hold moisture in the soil . Rocks used as mulch hold up to the conditions better than the organic matter recommended as mulch in other places . Beds to Meadow The next steps you can take in transforming your yard into a natural landscape are more dramatic . They will be more noticeable to your neighbors , so do this gradually if they are likely to take issue with what you are doing . Soften the edges . Squared-off flowerbeds and borders make your landscape look rigid and formal . Reshape them to have gentle curves and to become asymmetrical . Contour your beds and borders to fit the naturally graceful topography of your land . Go native . Replace high-maintenance annual and perennial flowers with those that have adapted to your region 's conditions . You can find natives in colors and forms similar to those that you love in the more familiar nonnative plants , says Jacob Blue of Applied Ecological Services , in Brodhead , Wisconsin . Select plants not just by zone , but by topography , exposure , and region , advises Eskelson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape with " thug natives , " so called because they hold their ground and do not let sod encroach . For example , monarda , black-eyed Susans , and Joe Pye weed , native to much of North America , bloom for much of the season , crowd out sod , and gradually spread into an authentic-looking meadow . Mimic the forest . Walk through the woods or other undeveloped areas near your home , Nadeau suggests , and identify what plants are growing there . Then create a woodland by replicating those plants in your own landscape . With just these simple steps , you can reduce the size and maintenance demands of your lawn , manage water runoff , make your yard part of a " wildlife corridor , " and restore native plants that are well adapted to your climate and conditions .

Sidebar Minimizing a lawn and creating a more natural yard is n't an all-or-nothing proposition " Sidebar Newbie hint Before choosing plants , observe your yard to see where the sun shines and for how long each day , and where the ground stays wet and where it dries out quickly . Kick in the grass : Keep a lawn for play areas and pathways , as this suburban Connecticut homeowner has done . Elsewhere , replace the turf to make room for perennials , shrubs , and ornamental grasses that will fill your yard with color year-round and provide food and shelter for local wildlife . Fresh fields : Over time , this Connecticut gardener has weaned her landscape off years of lawn chemical applications . Her plan to grow a meadow instead started with amending the soil and observing what grows in nearby forests , as well as studying up on what native plants thrive in her New England microclimate . Her pathways were built using stones found on the property . Attractive downspouts ( right ) direct rainfall to a water harvesting system .
