<p> It 's one of the loneliest places in Baghdad - the British military cemetery , where hundreds of forlorn gravestones attest to the price of imperialism in Iraq . <p> In 1920 , a Shiite revolt erupted against British occupiers , who had arrived in Mesopotamia at the start of World War I. Britain pushed out Ottoman forces , but did n't move fast enough to create a promised new nation state . The uprising surprised the British , left more than 2,200 occupation troops and an estimated 8,450 Iraqis dead or wounded - and cost , by one account , three times as much as British financing of the entire Arab revolt against the Ottomans . <p> Today the US faces the same dilemma that dogged the British : How to grant self-rule to Iraqis as promised , while keeping overall control . Despite rhetoric from Washington that it will transform Iraq into a democratic beacon in the Mideast , few Iraqis believe the US is sincere . <p> " The Americans believe in democracy , but they do not believe in its results , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Princeton , Harvard , and Oxford . " The ballot box should rule - period . It is so in America , and it should be so in Iraq . It ca n't be avoided by any more tactics . " Changing such attitudes will require the US to learn lessons from the British colonial experience - lessons applied only fitfully so far . Among them : <p> Take steps to satisfy Iraqi expectations . <p> The US-appointed Governing Council signed an interim constitution on Monday , and Washington insists that it will hand sovereignty back to Iraqis on June 30 . Elections for an interim assembly are due next January . But American troops will not be going home this summer if bloody resistance attacks continue , and few Iraqis expect the US to cede real control . <p> " When the British came to Baghdad in 1917 , they declared that ' We are here as liberators , not occupiers . ' That is the same statement the Americans have made , " says Ghassan Atiyyah , an expert on the 1920 revolt and head of the Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British were sincere about it , and they proved to have other designs . Today Iraqis are asking : ' How could America get rid of Saddam in three weeks , and have no elections in 11 months ? ' " <p> The historical comparison does not always hold . The anti-British revolt mostly involved Shiites , but was more tribal and rural than religious , and fanned by overtaxation . Bowing to military cost-cutting at home , and public pressure not to deepen its role in Iraq , the British government back then had less at stake in Iraq than America does today , as it uses Iraq as a test case of unilateral US action in a post-Sept. 11 world . Still , many points do apply . <p> Do n't opt for military solutions . <p> The British relied on air power to quell dissent - at great cost to the civilian population and to its credibility . Americans , too , are often accused of heavy-handed tactics while hunting Saddam Hussein loyalists and anticoalition guerrillas . <p> British cabinet papers from 1921 raised doubt about keeping " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our intention of bombing women and children . " <p> In his memoirs , the British commander in charge of quelling the revolt , Lt. Gen. Sir Aylmer Haldane , wrote in 1922 of the " vanity of what we undertook , " in confiscating 63,000 rifles from Iraqi tribes . The Iraqis " not only rearmed themselves but acquired weapons of more modern type , " Gen. Haldane lamented , leading him to conclude of Mesopotamia that " it is folly to think , not in one year but even in many years , to draw the teeth of its inhabitants . " <p> Local leaders seen as puppets only build resentment . <p> Historian Paul Rish , in an introduction to Haldane 's memoirs , indicates that one method that contributed to the 1920 revolt and future unrest was a British plan that " relied heavily on putting pliable but unpopular Arabs in sham authority . " <p> That view echoes complaints today among Iraqis that the Governing Council is a tool of US policy , under Washington 's thumb in the same way that powerful British advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensured a 96 percent landslide for their chosen new Sunni monarch , King Faisal I , by inviting his chief opponent to tea , and then whisking him off to exile in British-ruled Ceylon . " Arab rule " had arrived in name only . King Faisal despaired in a secret memo in 1933 that his government was " far and away weaker than the people , " who were " unimaginable masses of human beings devoid of any patriotic ideas ... prone to anarchy , and perpetually ready to rise against any government whatsoever . " <p> The British-devised monarchy of Iraq lasted until its overthrow in 1958 . " The Americans should draw parallels from the British experience , " says Saad Jawad , a political scientist at the University of Baghdad . " Not only are they insisting on ruling Iraq on their own , but like the British , gave promises they did not fulfill . " <p> Avoid creating new enemies . <p> The British expected to be greeted with open arms by Iraqis after forcing out Ottoman troops . But instead they found fierce resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that gratitude over the fall of Saddam Hussein would overcome Iraqi uneasiness about a new occupation . <p> " The British saw the Shia religious establishment in the 1920s as a direct rival for power , so they fled back into the arms of the Sunni elite , " says Toby Dodge , at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London . Despite London 's detailed efforts to win the support of tribes , anti-British resentment grew to the point where Iraq 's majority Shiite and Sunnis put aside their differences , and unified . <p> Likewise , US Administrator Paul Bremer , in his effort to scrub away Hussein 's Baath regime , has given reason to broaden anti-US resistance . " Bremer thought he would rule directly ... but the Americans started making mistakes . They dissolved the Army , thinking they could handle security themselves , " says Dr. Atiyyah . <p> There is no Arabic word for de-Baathification , and the closest one for this uncompromising policy means " uprooting . " That " smacks of Baathist rule , " adds Atiyyah . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wound up uniting enemies - the Army , the Baathists , and Sunnis . " <p> If the US has n't learned not to create enemies , Iraq 's majority Shiites certainly have . So far , Shiites have made their complaints about the US without violence . They sacrificed during the 1920 revolt , Iraqis say , lost power and gained nothing . <p> Do n't let vengeance cloud chances for reconciliation . <p> General Haldane states in his memoirs that Iraqis " respect nothing but force , " but he also notes his surprise that " resentment is small or wears off quickly . " He writes of " princely hospitality " while snipe shooting with hundreds of sheikhs , including " those who stood by us during the insurrection , and others , a far greater number , who took up arms against us at the time . " <p> Iraqis today share such mixed emotions about the US presence . " The first lie of the Bush administration is that they are liberators , but in fact they are occupiers , " says Haj-Muhammad al-Khashallee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its aged walls with historical photographs . " If they are sincere enough to make Iraq their friend by handing over power to the Iraqi people , then good . " <p> " We need the Americans , " says Atiyyah . " Who else will protect the Kurds from the Turks ? Who will protect the Sunnis from Shia hegemony ? The secular from the Islamist ? You Americans will be loved by everyone if you can be the facilitator , not the ruler ... We need the helping hand , not someone to take our place . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
