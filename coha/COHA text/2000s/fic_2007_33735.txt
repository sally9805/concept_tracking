Chapter One Manhattan-Some Time Ago Dear Ms. O'Hara , Your father was such a lovely man and this tragic loss will be felt by everyone who knew him for years to come . In my mind 's eye , I can still see him cleaning my grill with a vengeance . That man surely did love a clean grill . Please accept my deepest and most sincere condolences . There is the small matter of his rent for the month of January . Not wanting to be an additional burden at this terribly sensitive time , I will simply deduct it from his security deposit . Although I am loath to broach this subject , I must notify you that the timely removal of his personal property will obviously impact the amount of money I am able to return to you . Once again , please accept my profound sympathy . Cordially , Miriam Elizabeth Swanson Making my way weather was fast changing from cold and damp to a bone-chilling arctic freeze . My snow boots were tucked in my PBS member 's canvas tote bag , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be traipsing around Manhattan with a canvas tote bag . But the proud logo sent amessage to all those people who enjoyed the benefits of Public Television but felt no compunction to support it even with the smallest of donations . The fact that people took without giving irked me . On the brighter side , I had always thought it would be great fun to be a volunteer in their phone bank during a campaign , to sit up there doing something so worthwhile as hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions of people , looked on . I had submitted my name as a candidate for the job many times , but I had never been called . Perhaps I should have sent them a more thorough bio with a more flattering photograph . Something youthful . Ah , me . Another disappointment . Another rejection . But what member of the human race did n't have unfulfilled little fantasies ? Chin up , Miriam , I told myself , and trudged on . The weather continued to deteriorate and Charles Dickens himself would have agreed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered toward the earth and covered every inch of the sky . They were closing in and threatening to burst . It would surely pour snow or sleet at any moment . There was nothing I could do about the weather or my feelings of gloom brought on by a claustrophobic sky . After all these years in New York , I was as resigned to winter as I was to any number of things that fed my love/hate relationship with the city . Anyway , where else was I to go ? Live with my sons ? No way . Live with my mother ? Not in a million years . I adjusted my muffler to protect my cheeks . At least I had written Ms. O'Hara a note , and despite the inclement conditions , I had been sure to get it in the mail . I could n't help but pause to think there was something so lazy about people who abandoned fountain pens or pens of any kind in favor of the expeditiousness of e-mail on any and every occasion . Including expressions of sympathy . Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone receiving an e-mail telling of a close friend 's death . Including a frowning emoticon , God save us . The reason I remember was that it was so completely absurd to me . And speaking of fountain pens , they now had a disposable variety available at all those office-supply chain stores , which to me defeated the purpose of using a fountain pen in the first place . Was n't it about holding a beautiful object in your hands and feeling its solid weight ? Its worth and the importance of its history ? Remember when penmanship was taught in the classroom and its beautiful execution was prized ? But that is what the world has come to . Quick this and disposable that . To my dying day , I would remain a lonely standard-bearer in a world that continued to toss aside every inch of civility we have ever known . Handwritten notes seemed to have gone the way of corsages-their existence was rare . It just was the way it was . I hurried along to the funeral service , tiptoeing inside the church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant , Kevin Dolan . " I have always loved St. Bartholomew 's , " I whispered to him . I removed my coat and gloves and , as inconspicuously as possible , settled in the pew . The service had already begun and I regretted the fact that I was late , even if it was only by a few minutes . In the steamer trunk of middle age , folded , packed , and wrinkled with one physical and emotional insult after another , perimenopause had delivered a measure of intolerance , even toward myself . " Me , too , " Kevin whispered back , and sighed . " Poor Mr. O'Hara . Whoever thought he would just drop dead on the crosstown bus ? Just like that ! Poof . Gone . " He popped his wrist in front of him in a gesture that equated Mr. O'Hara 's death with a magician 's now you see it , now you do n't ! " Hush , " whispered someone in front of us . We paused in silence in deference to the occasion and then could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the Big Apple . That was the effect Kevin always had on me . In his presence I became a young gossiping washwoman , emphasis on young . " Pockets picked and ID stolen , " I added at a carefully calibrated low volume of clear displeasure . " Disgusting ! " " Five days in the city morgue ? Dreadful ! If I had n't called his family ... " " He 's lucky he was n't eaten by rats . Thank heavens for dental records ... " " Who could believe he went to a dentist with his snaggleteeth ? " Kevin said . " Please . He was my ... " said the woman in front of us , her shoulders racking with sobs . (
