Chapter One PAKERSFIELD , GEORGIA 1958 Mama washed the last dish she ever intended to wash . I alone witnessed the event , in silence . It was on a Friday-a school day-but instead of sitting in a classroom , I was standing in unfamiliar surroundings , the home of my mother 's employers , stunned by the wealth around me . As I regarded my mother through unwavering peripheral vision , something in her glances at me seemed to say , " Tangy Mae , this will be your life . Grab an apron and enjoy it . " Domestic servitude was not what I desired for myself , but she had only to speak and I would do anything she asked . It was my obligation to obey her though I did not want to be like my older brothers , Harvey and Sam , who seemed to breathe at our mother 's command . They were men , and their lack of initiative disturbed me , although I knew they could not just leave our mother 's house . Departure required consideration of consequences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our mother was tall and slender with a head of thick reddish-brown hair . Her face , with its cream-colored skin and high cheekbones beneath dark gray eyes , was set off by a gleaming white smile accented by dimples . I thought she was beautiful , despite my acquaintance with the demon that hibernated beneath her elegant surface . She had worked seven years cleaning house for the Munford family . Now she stood at their kitchen sink holding a dish under running water longer than necessary before handing it to me to wipe . She finally dried her hands on her apron , took a seat at the table , and waited for her pain to subside . She had spent most of the day complaining of her misery while instructing me on the proper way to make a bed , scrub a floor , polish silverware , use a washing machine , and on and on . According to Mama , her pain-something like gas-had begun during the wee hours of the morning . It balled up in her chest , rolled through her stomach , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow dribble in her swollen ankles , then just like that-her finger snapped-it bounced back to her chest and started all over again , taking her breath away . On the table , beneath a crystal saltshaker , was an envelope . She picked it up and fanned it before her face . " Fifteen dollars " she said indignantly . " I do n't care what I do ' round here , it 's always the same fifteen dollars . Never mind that I stayed late on Tuesday evening when Mister Frederick 's mother came for dinner . Never mind that I walked to the Colonial for flour that Miss Arlisa forgot to pick up . Week in , week out , always the same fifteen dollars . " She removed the bills and tucked them inside the pocket of her dress , then slid the envelope and a pencil across the table . " Sit down " she said , " I want you to write me a note to Miss Arlisa . " My obedience , as always , was swift . " Dear Miss Arlisa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " Tangy Mae can do just as good a job as I can . She is my child and I learned her good . She can start work for you on Monday . I will be dead " ' My hand trembled slightly , but I wrote the note exactly as she dictated . She snatched the envelope from the table , scanned the words , then passed it back to me . " Sign it , Rozelle Quinn , " she said . " Miss Arlisa probably wo n't even know who that is . All they know ' round here is Rosie . Rosie do this and Rosie do that . " I sat there dumbfounded . Loss traveled through my body , pulsed at my temples , and numbed my fingertips . I wanted to wail , to one-up her moans , believing my pain to be more severe than anything she could be feeling . " You got something you wan na say ? " she asked . " No , ma'am , " I answered , forcing myself to look at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choking me . I covered my mouth with my hand so that Mama could not hear the words that might seep out . Mama , you promised Mr. Pace that you would let me go to school one more year . You promised me the ninth grade . You promised ! Mr. Pace thinks I 'm smart . Please , Mama , let me go to school ! But I had nothing with which to bargain and I knew it . Already I had attended school longer than any of my siblings . I was in ninth grade , which in itself was miraculous , considering I had never set foot in an eighth-grade classroom . Academically , I surpassed my peers , but at home I was a complete failure . At the age of twelve , my mother 's children were expected to drop out of school , get a job , and help support the family . I fell short of expectations . " We got ta get on home " Mama said . " Put me a bit of coffee and sugar in some wax paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said , and thought how calm my mother appeared for a woman who planned to be dead come Monday morning . Holding onto the table with one hand and supporting her back with the other , she heaved herself to her feet , then removed her apron and hung it in the broom closet . She checked the house one last time to make sure everything was in order , retrieved yesterday 's newspaper from a basket beside the trash bin , then ushered me out by way of the back door . The bitter cold January afternoon seemed to freeze my mother 's face into a mask of disdain . " They done seen the last of me , " she grumbled . " They do n't give a damn if I freeze to death . They do n't care nothing ' bout me , and I do n't care nothing ' bout them . " I knew she was talking to herself , so I walked along beside her , keeping my mouth and my coat tightly closed . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munfords for hours . Miss Arlisa , she opined , was a fat , lazy white woman who had no idea how to keep house or satisfy a man . Mr. Frederick was a show-off , who drove his automobile around town , honking the horn , and bragging about everything he possessed , including his ugly wife . I had seen them only once , the time they brought Mama home with a load of old clothes they had given her . The only things I knew about the Munfords were that they owned the hardware store in town and that Mrs. Munford was not nearly as ugly as Mama had described her . She was not nearly as pretty as Mama , either . " I been watching you , " Mama said , as we walked along the paved street that led out of East Grove and toward the Cherokee Creek Bridge that would take us into Stump Town . " You think them Munfords is rich white folk , do n't you ? Well , they ai n't rich . If you wan na see rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where the really classy white folks live . They got mansions up there that take from morning to night to clean , and that 's wit ' five and six people working . These East Grove whites bow down to them on Meadow Hill , and you better believe it . " I had long been familiar with the Pakersfield hierarchy which ranked Meadow Hill supreme . Everybody bowed to somebody , but , all in all , Pakersfield was a decent place to live . The Negroes had Stump Town , the flats , and Plymouth , while the whites had Meadow Hill , East Grove , and North Ridge . There was never any trouble as long as everybody stayed where they belonged . We usually did . Miss Janie Jay 's house was the first house on the Stump Town side of Cherokee Creek . Mama did n't care much for Miss Janie , claimed she was highfalutin and put on airs , so it surprised me when she strolled through the gate and up to Miss Janie 's porch . I hesitated for only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Janie I 'm dying out here and I 'd be much obliged for a drank of water , " Mama said . Miss Janie taught Sunday school and sang in the choir at the Solid Rock Baptist Church . She was old , probably about sixty or so . She wore her hair parted down the center with a thick gray plait on each side . On Sundays she covered the plaits with one of her many fancy hats , and when the spirit moved her , she would wave one hand in the air and hold tight to the hat with her other hand . " Tangy Quinn , " she said , opening the door and staring out at me . " Should n't you be at school ? " " Mama 's real sick , Miss Janie , " I said . " She 's out here on your porch and wants to know if you can spare her a drink of water " " I 'm dying , Janie , " Mama groaned . She had positioned herself on Miss Janie 's porch swing , slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking as if she might die at any second . " Rosie , what is it ? " Miss Janie showed alarm at the sight of Mama . " Just hold on , honey . I 'll get you some water . " While Miss Janie went for water , I kept a close watch on my mother . Her eyes were closed and her arms rested against her abdomen with one hand clutching the newspaper . She moaned , shook her head as if disapproving of the sound , then moaned again . She did that several times , changing the pitch and depth of each moan , before it dawned on me that she was rehearsing her suffering , exaggerating her misery . By the time Miss Janie returned , Mama was trembling all over , tears streaked her cheeks , and her hair was loose and tangled about her head . She was in such a state that it took me and Miss Janie both to get her into an upright position . Miss Janie held the glass and Mama took a few sips of water before slumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , " Miss Janie suggested . " I can get you some tea . " " No , Janie . I 'm going home to my children , " Mama whispered . " This is a terrible way to die , but I need to be wit ' my children . There 's things I need to tell ' em before it 's too late . " Miss Janie 's eyes brimmed with tears . " Oh , Rosie , I 'm so sorry , " she said . " Just remember , Jesus saves . Put your trust in Jesus " Miss Janie tried to get Mama to come inside to warm herself , and offered to call the doctor , but Mama refused . Miss Janie helped her to her feet and walked us out to the gate , saying we should pray , that God answers prayer . Mama held tightly to my arm and used my shoulder to support her weight as we made our way slowly up Oglesbee Street . My knees were so cold that I knew if one touched the other I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother with me . As we turned the corner onto Chestnut Street , Mama loosened her grip on my arm . She straightened her back , smoothed and pinned her hair in place , then smiled and winked at me . Painfully , I parted my frost-chapped lips and returned a smile . I loved her with all my heart , but if she did not die by Monday morning , I was determined to discover from the pages of my schoolbooks , how to break the chains that bound me to my mother . Chapter Two Our house stood alone on a hill off Penyon Road , about half a mile outside the city limits . It was old , crippled , and diseased-an emblem of poverty and neglect . Nature had tried to cure it by embracing the rear frame with herbs , roots , and a jumble of foliage which spilled over from the surrounding woodland . Nature had failed , and in frustration she sought to destroy the house by eroding the very foundation on which it stood . Erosion had left the house slanted at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , round poles lodged into tilted , unstable earth . Occasionally , huge chunks of brown earth shook loose , skirted around the poles , and rolled down the slope into a waiting gully . All of my life home had been these three drafty rooms under the same rusted tin roof . The house swayed in the wind but stood . It absorbed its fall of rainwater and stood . It groaned under the weight of celebrations and sorrows and did not crumble . But for how much longer ? I thought we might wake up one morning-or not wake up-in the rocky , muddy gully below . Or maybe we would simply blow across the dirt road and get lost in the overgrown field of weeds . I could not predict what would happen , but I feared we were destined for disaster . Mama stood at the foot of thirteen sagging , rickety steps that led up to a wide , shaky porch . All pretense was over . She was gasping for breath as she placed one foot on the first step and began , gingerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her knees buckled . My arms shot out instinctively , ready to break her fall . " Tara ! Tarabelle ! " I screamed . " Be quiet ! " Mama snapped , regaining her balance and resuming her climb . " Ai n't no need to wake the dead . " The front door , which was as much cardboard as plywood , swung open and my sister , Tarabelle , appeared on the porch . " What is it ? " she asked irritably . " Why you calling me like that ? " " Mama 's sick , " I answered breathlessly , my heart pounding in my chest . Tarabelle was sixteen and almost as tall as Mama . She had long , jet black hair , a copper-colored complexion , and the cold , black eyes of a dead poker player . I had never seen the eyes of a dead person-in fact , I had never seen a poker game but-I had heard that poker faces were expressionless , and I knew that dead people showed no emotion . That was Tarabelle . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Her mouth twitched as if she might smile , but I knew better . " She ai n't sick , " Tarabelle said , still staring at Mama . " She ' bout ready to have that baby . That 's all . " I had been ignorant in my innocence but I was wiser than my sister because I had learned to study Mama as diligently as I studied my books . I watched our mother as she squeezed the collar of her coat . I heard her sharp intake of breath . I saw frustration and pain leap from the core of her soul and surge the length of her arm , down to the delicate hand that struck my sister 's face . The blow sent Tarabelle reeling back . She bounced off the porch wall and landed less than an inch from the drop that would have taken her down into the gully . She lay there , those cold , black eyes boring into the equally cold , gray eyes of our mother . " I 'm dying " Mama said with calm finality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch and nodded her head . " Yes , ma'am . " Edna Pearl and Laura Gail , who were only four and five , stood in the doorway , staring in fascinated fright . I watched as Edna stole back into the shadowy gloom pierced intermittently by daylight filtering in through cracks in the walls . It was our only source of illumination until dusk , when we were allowed to light the kerosene lamps . I knew Edna had gone to alert Martha Jean to our mother 's presence . My next eldest sibling , Martha Jean , was a defective replica of our mother . She could not hear and had never spoken one coherent sentence in her life . There but by the grace of God went I , for only eleven months separated her silent beauty from my articulate homeliness . My imagination ran rampant when I thought of our births . I would fantasize Martha Jean stubbornly refusing to leave our mother 's womb until I was conceived . We would blend together , and my thick nose would become thin ; my coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have deep dimples in my cheeks . And , in turn , Martha Jean would be able to hear and speak .
