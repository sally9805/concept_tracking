After 20 years in the movie business , award-winning filmmaker is making a new statement with a film on HURRICANE KATRINA // IT 'S the quaint lobby of a New York City hotel . But when Spike Lee walks in , it might as well be the main terminal of Grand Central Station . " Hey , Spike , do the right thing , " one dude yells . " Hey , Spike , what happened to the Knicks ? " the bellhop chimes in . Between the shoutouts , handshakes , hugs and snapshots from the local hotel workers and the not-so-local tourists-like the one Asian woman who spoke little English but knew a lot about Lee-interviewing " Mr. New York " on his home turf proves to be as tough as playing an uninterrupted game of one-on-one with Michael Jordan on a neighborhood blacktop on Chicago 's South Side . And if squeezing in questions were n't hard enough-getting juicy answers-well , that was akin to squeezing blood from a turnip . In a New York minute , the best-laid interview plans dried up like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this : Question : Who 's the best young filmmaker right now ? " They 're all good . I ca n't judge , " he says . Question : Which one of your films is your favorite ? " They all are . " Question : What would you be doing if you were n't a filmmaker ? " I never thought about it . " What happened to the outspoken filmmaker who became one of the most recognized faces in America when he sported a flipped-up Brooklyn cap and funky square glasses as he upstaged MJ in those old Nike commercials ? What happened to that man-Mars Blackmon-the fast-talking alter ego who made " Yo ! Money " a household phrase , and Shelton Jackson Lee-the fast-talking ego himself-who seemed to have an opinion about everybody and everything ? Turns out , after two decades of moviemaking , in which Lee has directed 20 films grossing more than a quarter of a billion dollars collectively , a peculiar thing happened . Lee turned 30 , then 40 , and now is just months shy of turning 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . His rough edges have smoothed , and his tongue has traded in a little quickness for a lot of wisdom . Make no mistake ( from his entrepreneurial spirit to his dogmatic personality , not to mention the Brother is still funnier than all get out ) , Lee continues to remain true to his core . New Yorkers would accept nothing less , and often look for nothing more . But only after embracing multifaceted conversation over simple inquisition did the complex layers of a man who now picks and chooses his battles emerge . During the next hour , passion mixed with pride and purpose as he talked about everything from his dislike of gangsta rappers whose " lyrics have had a detrimental effect on youth " to his dislike of gangsta politicians whose " policies wreak havoc on the world " to his love of a day at the baseball park with his family . During the past 20 years , Spike says he has learned not only about his inner self , but about the outside world . He has learned , sometimes the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , especially his audience . ( " Not anymore . I did before , but I learned that you ca n't dictate what people are going to think or feel . " ) He 's learned not to force situations . ( " I would like to really do something in television ... but .. . I 'm not going to do a sitcom . And that seems to be the only thing Blacks are given an opportunity to do . So I may end up not doing anything . " ) And not to take his good fortune for granted . ( " I 'm very fortunate . I say my prayers every night because I 'm blessed . The majority of people on this earth die after working at a job they hated all their life . I 'm blessed . " ) He has learned the importance of giving back , serving as artistic director at , the New York University graduate film school , and as a mentor to many of the young filmmakers trying to make their mark in Hollywood . Described by some as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made an indelible mark on the film industry ever since his first studio film , She 's Got ta Have It , debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986 . And while he says , " That 's the film that started it all . That was the launching pad . I 'm very proud of it ... , " he admits that " I did n't know what I was doing " and was " just stumbling , bumbling along . I made many mistakes and just learned from them . There were no mistakes that were really catastrophic , so it was good that I got some bumps and bruises . " In fact , Lee says She 's Got ta Have It is so bad ( in light of his expertise level now ) , that he " ca n't watch it , " he says of the hugely successful film that took only 15 days to film , only cost $175,000 to make , but grossed more than $8 million at the box office . " I 'm saying that understanding that for a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , I ca n't watch it . It 's been years and years since I watched it . I 'll watch it again , I guess , but not anytime soon . " That 's in sharp contrast to his latest movie , When the Levees Broke , a film about Hurricane Katrina , which he calls an " epic documentary . " In the documentary , which premiered on HBO August 21 , Lee says that he hopes " to document the voices of the witnesses who were a part of this American tragedy , " he says . " It 's my hope that it will redirect the focus of the nation , not only back to New Orleans but the whole Gulf Coast region . It 's been a year , but nothing has changed . " Among other revelations , the film raises the possibility that levees were intentionally toppled . " We have various people who give various opinions ; we leave it up to the audience to make up their own minds , " says Lee , who says that he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America 's consciousness . While Lee says that all of his movies have been unique , none has been as intense as Malcolm X. " Denzel Washington and I used to laugh about it , but we were serious , " says Lee , who has worked with Washington four times , including on the bank-heist thriller Inside Man . " We used to joke that we better keep our passports on us at all times , in case we have to slip out of the country . Before we started , and while we were making Malcolm X , Black folks would come up to us and say , " Do n't mess this one up . " And they were serious , too . " And while many of his movies during the last decade have fallen short of what insiders deem as financial successes , for Lee , his career has never been about churning out Hollywood blockbusters . ( Even though Inside Man , now available on DVD , did gross $29 million in the first weekend , making it Lee 's biggest movie opening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When he began making short films while a student at Morehouse College , he simply wanted to be relevant , make films that he could be proud of , and help open doors for other African-Americans . " I just did n't want to be one and done , " he says . " My goal in the very beginning was to work hard and build a body of work . I also wanted to be an entre into the business , not just in front of the camera , but behind the camera as well . " Lee says that while a lot of progress has been made by African-Americans in Hollywood , it 's still hard for an African-American to have the ultimate say over what makes it to television and film . " We still have not gotten to those gate-keeping positions , " he says , " the positions where we decide which films get made , which films do n't get made , which TV shows get made , which shows do n't get made . " He believes , though , that the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable and Hollywood studios . But it wo n't happen until certain attitudes about race changes , he says . " We should see that day . I hope so , " he says . " If s very discouraging because they say they would hire African-Americans if they knew of any qualified ones . That 's the same tired line White corporations have been telling us for decades . If they are serious , I have a stack of rsums I can give them . " Spike calls the new crop of African-American filmmakers " very encouraging , " saying that he has never viewed them as rivals . " The more , the better , " he says . " I have never , ever seen another African-American filmmaker as competition , whether it was Robert Townsend with Hollywood Shuffle , John Singleton with Boyz N the Hood or the Hudlin brothers with Menace II Sodety . I never , ever wanted to be the only one out there . We need as many as possible . " Some young filmmakers come to Lee for advice , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people who come to me , I thank them for it and try to give them some guidance based on the experience that I have , " he says . " But I do n't think of it as an affront if someone does n't come to me for advice . Sometimes you have to learn on your own . " Last year , an authorized biography , That 's My Story and I 'm Sticking to It , was also released . The book chronicles his first 20 years in the movie business . And earlier this year , Universal Studios released " The Spike Lee Joint Collection " that brings five of Lee 's most popular films together for the first time . dockers , Jungle Fever , Do The Right Thing , Crooklyn , and Mo ' Better Blues are included in the three-disc DVD set . In celebration of 20 years in movies , Spike was the center of attention at a gala on Royal Caribbean 's largest cruise ship , which was docked in New York City .

While he admits that his deep ties to the Big Apple sometimes prompt New Yorkers to feel like they know him personally , approaching him wherever he goes , he says that he has never had security personnel , and does n't need it . His movie company , 40 Acres &; A Mule Filmworks , is located in Brooklyn , while his advertising firm , Spike DDB , is in Manhattan . A Brooklyn native , Lee moved to Manhattan from Brooklyn nine years ago . Currently , he lives in a townhouse with his wife , Tonya Lewis Lee , and children , daughter Satchel , 11 , and 8-year-old son Jackson . He calls himself a hands-on father . " But I 'm not strict , " he says . " I just have to thank my wife . She 's a wonderful mother . " Having branched out into everything from directing beer commercials to writing children 's books with his wife , Lee is still energized , and still looking to do great things in the future .
