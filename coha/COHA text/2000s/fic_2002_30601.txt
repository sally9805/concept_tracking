Theo Buchanan could n't seem to shake the virus . He knew he was running a fever because every bone in his body ached and he had chills . He refused to acknowledge that he was ill , though ; he was just a little off-kilter , that was all . He could tough it out . Besides , he was sure he was over the worst of it . The god-awful stitch in his side had subsided into a dull throbbing , and he was positive that it meant he was on the mend . If it was the same bug that had infected most of the staff back in his Boston office , then it was one of those twenty-four-hour things , and he should be feeling as good as new by tomorrow morning . Except , the throbbing in his side had been going on for a couple of days now . He decided to blame his brother , Dylan , for that ache . He 'd really nailed Theo during a family football game on their parents ' lawn at Nathan 's Bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Theo figured that if he continued to ignore it , the pain would eventually go away . Damn , he was feeling like an old man these days , and he was n't even thirty-three yet . He did n't think he was contagious , and he had too much to do to go to bed and sweat the fever out of his body . He 'd flown from Boston to New Orleans to speak at a law symposium on organized crime and to receive recognition he did n't believe he deserved for simply doing his job . Tonight was the first of three black-tie affairs . He 'd promised to attend a fund-raiser , and he could n't back out . Dinner was going to be prepared by five of the top chefs in the city , but the gourmet food was going to be wasted on him . The thought of swallowing anything , even water , made his stomachlurch . He had n't eaten anything since yesterday afternoon . He sure as certain was n't up to pointless chitchat tonight . He tucked the room key into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone rang . It was his brother Nick calling to check in . " What 's going on ? " " I 'm walking out the door , " Theo answered . " Where are you calling from ? Boston or Holy Oaks ? " " Boston , " Nick answered . " I helped Laurant close the lake house and then we drove back home together . " " Is she staying with you until the wedding ? " " Are you kidding ? Tommy would send me straight to hell . " Theo laughed . " I guess having a priest for a future brother-in-law does put a crimp in your sex life . " " Five more weeks and I 'm gon na be a married man . Hard to believe , is n't it ? " " It 's hard to believe any woman would have you . " " Laurant 's nearsighted . I told her I was good-looking and she believed me . She 's staying with Mom and Dad until we all head back to Iowa for the wedding . What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to go to , " he answered . " So what do you want ? " " I just thought I 'd call and say hello . " " No , you did n't . You want something . What is it ? Come on , Nick . I 'm gon na be late . " " Theo , you 've got to learn to slow down . You ca n't keep running for the rest of your life . I know what you 're doing . You think that if you bury yourself in work , you wo n't think about Rebecca . It 's been four years since she died , but you " Theo cut him off . " I like my life , and I 'm not in the mood to talk about Rebecca . " " You 're a workaholic . " " Did you call to lecture me ? " " No , Laurant 's been bugging me to call you . " " Is she there ? Let me talk to her , " he said . He sat down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nick 's fiance had that effect on all the Buchanan brothers . She made everyone feel good . " She is n't here . She went out with Jordan , and you know our sister . God only knows what time they 'll get home . Anyway , I promised Laurant that I 'd track you down and ask ... " " What ? " " She wanted me to ask you but I figure I did n't need to , " he said . " It 's understood . " Theo held his patience . " What 's understood ? " " You 're gon na be my best man in the wedding . " " What about Noah ? " " He 's in the wedding , of course , but I 'm expecting you to be best man . I figured you already knew that , but Laurant thought I should ask you anyway . " " Yeah ? " " Yeah , what ? " Theo smiled . " Yeah , okay . " His brother was a man of few words . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , that 's not until tomorrow night . " " When do you get your trophy ? " " It 's a plaque , and I get it right before I give my speech . " " So if you blow it and put all those armed officers to sleep , they ca n't take the trophy back , can they ? " " I 'm hanging up . " " Hey , Theo ? For once , stop thinking about work . See the sights . Get laid . You know , have a good time . Hey , I know ... why do n't you give Noah a call . He 's in Biloxi for a couple of months for a training conference . He could drive over to New Orleans , and the two of you could have some fun . " If anyone knew how to have fun , it was Noah Clayborne . The FBI agent had become a close friend of the family after working on several assignments with Nick and then later assisting Theo with his investigations as a federal attorney for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had a wicked sense of fun , and Theo was n't sure he could survive a night out with Noah just now . " Okay , maybe , " he answered . Theo hung up the phone , stood , and quickly doubled over from the pain that radiated through his right side . It had started in his belly , but it had moved down , and , damn , but it stung . The muscle he 'd pulled felt like it was on fire . A stupid football injury was n't going to keep him down . Muttering to himself , he grabbed his cell phone from the charger , put it into his breast pocket with his reading glasses , slipped his gun into his belt holster , and left the room . By the time he reached the lobby , the pain had receded and he was feeling almost human again . That , of course , only reinforced his own personal golden rule . Ignore the pain and it would go away . Besides , a Buchanan could tough anything out . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extravagant affair before , and as she stood on the steps overlooking the hotel ballroom , she felt like Alice about to fall through the looking glass into Wonderland . There were flowers everywhere , beautiful spring flowers in sculptured urns on the marble floors and in crystal vases on all the white linen tablecloths . In the very center of the ballroom , beneath a magnificent crystal chandelier , was a cluster of giant hothouse-nurtured magnolia trees in full bloom . Their heavenly fragrance filled the air . Waiters moved smoothly through the crowd carrying silver trays with fluted champagne glasses while others rushed from table to table lighting long , white tapered candles . Mary Ann Winters , a friend since childhood days , stood by Michelle 's side taking it all in . " I 'm out of my element here , " Michelle whispered . " I feel like an awkward teenager . " " You do n't look like one , " Mary Ann said . " I might as well be invisible . I swear every man is staring at you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could anything look so plain and ordinary on a hanger and so " " So devastatingly sexy on you ? It clings in all the right places . Face it , you 've got a killer figure . " " I should never have spent so much money on a dress . " " For heaven 's sake , Michelle , it 's an Armani ... and you got it for a song , I might add . " Michelle self-consciously brushed her hand down the side of the soft fabric . She thought about how much she 'd paid for the dress and decided she would have to wear it at least twenty times to make it cost-effective . She wondered if other women did that rationalized a frivolous expense to appease the guilt . There were so many more important things she could have used the money for , and when , in heaven 's name , was she ever going to have another opportunity to wear this beautiful dress again ? Not in Bowen , she thought . Not in a million years . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk me into buying this dress . " Mary Ann impatiently brushed a strand of white blond hair back over her shoulder . " Do n't you dare start in complaining about the cost again . You never spend any money on yourself . I 'll bet it 's the first really gorgeous dress you 've ever owned , is n't it ? You 're absolutely beautiful tonight . Promise me you 'll stop worrying and enjoy yourself . " Michelle nodded . " You 're right . I 'll stop worrying . " " Good . Now let 's go mingle . There 's hors d'oeuvres and champagne out in the courtyard , and we 've got to eat at least a thousand dollars ' worth each . That 's what the tickets cost . I 'll meet you there . " Her friend had just gone down the stairs , when Dr. Cooper spotted Michelle and motioned for her to join him . He was the chief of surgery at Brethren Hospital , where she had been moonlighting the past month . Cooper was usually reserved , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite affectionate . And effervescent . He kept telling her how happy he was that she was using the tickets he 'd given her and how pretty she looked all dressed up . Michelle thought that if Dr. Cooper got any happier , he was going to pass out in the soup . A few minutes later , Cooper 's wife joined them with another older couple in tow . Michelle used the opportunity to sneak away . She walked around into the adjacent hallway with the bank of elevators . And that 's when she noticed him . He was leaning against a pillar , hunched over , tilted protectively to one side . The man was tall , broad-shouldered , well built , like an athlete , she thought . But there was a sickly gray pallor to his complexion , and as she walked toward him , she saw him grimace and grab his stomach . He was definitely in trouble . She touched his arm to get his attention just as the elevator doors opened . He staggered upright and looked down at her . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need help ? " He answered her by throwing up all over her . She could n't get out of the way because he 'd grabbed hold of her arm . His knees buckled then and she knew he was going to go down . She wrapped her arms around his waist and tried to ease him to the floor , but he lurched forward at the same time , taking her with him . Theo 's head was spinning . He landed on top of the woman . He heard her groan and desperately tried to find the strength to get up . He thought he might be dying and he did n't think that would be such a bad thing if death would make the pain go away . It was unbearable now . His stomach rolled again , and another wave of intense agony cut through him . He wondered if this was what it felt like to be stabbed over and over again . He passed out then , and when he next opened his eyes , he was flat on his back and she was leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . She had pretty blue eyes , more violet than blue , he thought , and freckles on the bridge of her nose . Then , as suddenly as it had stopped , the fire started burning in his side again , so much worse than before . A spasm wrenched his stomach , and he jerked . " Son of a bitch . " The woman was talking to him , but he could n't understand what she was saying . And what the hell was she doing to him ? Was she robbing him ? Her hands were everywhere , tugging at his jacket , his tie , his shirt . She was trying to straighten out his legs . She was hurting him , damn it , and every time he tried to push her hands away , they came back to poke and prod some more . He felt her open his jacket , knew she could see the gun holstered above his hip . He was crazed with pain now , could n't seem to think straight . He only knew he could n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mugger . He 'd give her that . She looked like one of those J. Crew models . Sweet , he thought . No , she was n't sweet . She kept hurting him . " Look , lady , you can take my wallet , but you 're not getting my gun . Got that ? " He could barely get the words out through his gritted teeth . Her hand pressed into his side . He reacted instinctively , knocking her back . He thought he might have connected with something soft because he heard her yell before he went under again . Theo did n't know how long he was out , but when he opened his eyes , the bright lights made him squint . Where the hell was he ? He could n't summon up enough energy to move . He thought he might be on a table . It was hard , cold . " Where am I ? " His mouth was so dry , he slurred the question . " You 're in Brethren Hospital , Mr. Buchanan . " The man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him . " Did they catch her ? " " Who ? " " J. Crew . " " He 's loopy . " A female voice he did n't recognize made the comment . Theo suddenly realized he was n't in any pain . He felt good , in fact . Real good . Like he could fly . Odd , though , he did n't have the strength to move his arms . A mask was placed over his mouth and nose . He turned his head to get away from it . " Are you getting sleepy , Mr. Buchanan ? " He turned his head again and saw her . Blue Eyes . She looked like an angel , all golden . Wait a minute . What the hell was she doing here ? Wait ... " Mike , are you going to be able to see what you 're doing ? That eye looks bad . " " It 's fine . " " How 'd it happen ? " the voice behind Theo 's head asked . " He clipped me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was staring into Theo 's eyes when she answered . She had a green mask on , but he knew she was smiling . He was in such a happy daze now and so sleepy , he was having trouble keeping his eyes open . Conversation swirled around him , but none if it made any sense . A woman 's voice . " Where did you find him , Dr. Renard ? " " At a party . " Another woman leaned over him . " Hubba , hubba . " " Was it love at first sight ? " " You decide . He threw up all over me and ruined my new dress . " Someone laughed . " Sounds like love to me . I 'll bet he 's married . All the good-looking men are married . This one 's sure built . Did you check out the goods , Annie ? " " I hope our patient is sleeping . " " Not yet , " a male voice said . " But he is n't going to remember anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There seemed to be a party going on . Theo thought there were at least twenty or thirty people in the room with him . Why was it so damned cold ? And who was making all the clatter ? He was thirsty . His mouth felt like it was full of cotton . Maybe he ought to go get a drink . Yeah , that 's what he would do . " Where 's Dr. Cooper ? " " Probably passed out in the dessert by now . " Blue Eyes answered the question . Theo loved the sound of her voice . It was so damned sexy . " So you saw Cooper at the party ? " " Uh-huh , " Blue Eyes answered . " He was n't on call tonight . He works hard . It was nice to see him having a good time . Mary Ann 's probably having a great time too . " " You . " Theo struggled to get the word out . Still , he 'd gotten her attention because when he opened his eyes , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It 's time for you to go to sleep , Mr. Buchanan . " " He 's fighting it . " " What ... " Theo began . " Yes ? " " What do you want from me ? " The man hiding behind him answered . " Mike wants your appendix , Mr. Buchanan . " It sounded good to him . He was always happy to accommodate a beautiful woman . " Okay , " he whispered . " It 's in my wallet . " " We 're ready . " " It 's about time , " the man said . Theo heard the chair squeak behind him , then the stranger 's voice telling him to take deep breaths . Theo finally figured out who the man behind him was . Damn if it was n't Willie Nelson , and he was singing to him , something about Blue Eyes cryin ' in the rain . It was one hell of a party . Theo slept through recovery . When he awoke the following morning , he was in a hospital bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked to an IV . He closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind . What the hell had happened to him ? He could n't remember . It was past ten o'clock when he opened his eyes again . She was there , standing beside the bed , pulling the sheets up around his waist . Blue Eyes . He had n't imagined her after all . She looked different today . She was still dressed in surgical scrubs , but her hair was n't hidden underneath a cap . It was down around her shoulders , and the color was a deep , rich auburn . She was much prettier than he remembered . She noticed he was awake . " Good morning . How are you feeling ? Still a little drowsy ? " He struggled to sit up . She reached for the controls and pushed a button . The bed slowly rose . Theo felt a tugging in his side and a mild stinging sensation . " Tell me when . " " That 's good , " he said . " Thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatantly stared at her . He felt vulnerable and awkward sitting in bed in a hospital gown . He could n't think of anything clever to say to her . For the first time in his life he wanted to be charming , but he did n't have the faintest idea how to go about it . He was a die-hard workaholic , and there simply was n't room for social graces in his life . " Do you remember what happened last night ? " she asked , glancing up from her notes . " I had surgery . " " Yes . Your appendix was removed . Another fifteen minutes and you definitely would have ruptured . " " I remember bits and pieces . What happened to your eye ? " She smiled as she started writing in his chart again . " I did n't duck fast enough . " " Who are you ? " " Dr. Renard . " " Mike ? " " Excuse me ? " " Someone called you Mike . " Michelle closed the folder , put the lid back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave him her full attention . The surgical nurses were right . Theo Buchanan was gorgeous ... and sexy as hell . But none of that should matter . She was his physician , nothing more , nothing less , yet she could n't help reacting to him as any woman naturally would react to such a fit specimen . His hair was sticking up and he needed a shave , but he was still sexy . There was n't anything wrong with her noticing that ... unless , of course , he noticed her noticing . " You just asked me a question , did n't you ? " She drew a blank . He could tell he 'd rattled her , but he did n't know why . " I heard someone call you Mike . " She nodded . " Yes . The staff calls me Mike . It 's short for Michelle . " " Michelle 's a pretty name . " " Thank you . " It was all coming back to Theo now . He was at a party , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was breathtaking . He remembered that . She had killer blue eyes and Willie Nelson was with her . He was singing . No , that could n't be right . Obviously , his head had n't quite cleared yet . " You were talking to me ... after the surgery , " he said . " In recovery . Yes , " she agreed . " But you were doing most of the talking . " She was smiling again . " and by the way , the answer 's no . I wo n't marry you . " He smiled , sure she was joking . " I do n't remember being in pre-op . I remember the pain though . It hurt like a son of a ... " " I 'm sure it did . " " You did the surgery , did n't you ? I did n't imagine that ? " " Yes , I did the surgery . " She was backing out of the room . He did n't want her to leave just yet . He wanted to find out more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a surgeon . " Stupid , he thought , but it was the best he could come up with at the moment . " I hear that a lot . " " You look like you should be in college . " That statement , he decided , was worse than stupid . She could n't resist . " High school , actually . They let me operate for extra credit . " " Very funny . " " Dr. Renard ? May I interrupt ? " A male aide was standing in the hallway , shifting a large cardboard box under his arm . " Yes , Bobby ? " " Dr. Cooper filled this box with medical supplies from his office for your clinic , " the young man said . " What do you want me to do with it ? Dr. Cooper left it at the nurses ' station , but they wanted it moved . It was in the way . " " Would you mind taking it down to my locker ? " " It 's too big , Dr. Renard . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could carry it out to your car . " " My father has the car , " she said . She glanced around , then looked at Theo . " Would you mind if Bobby left my box here ? My father will carry it down to the car for me just as soon as he arrives . " " I do n't mind , " Theo said . " I wo n't be seeing you again . I 'm going home today , but do n't worry . You 're in good hands . Dr. Cooper 's Chief of Surgery here at Brethren , and he 'll take good care of you . " " Where 's home ? " " In the swamp . " " Are you kidding ? " " No , " she said . She smiled again , and he noticed the little dimple in her left cheek . " Home is a little town that 's pretty much surrounded by swamp , and I ca n't wait to get back there . " " Homesick ? " " Yes , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl at heart . It is n't a very glamorous life , and that 's what I like about it . " " You like living in the swamp . " It was a statement , not a question , but she responded anyway . " You sound shocked . " " No , just surprised . " " You 're from a big , sprawling city , so you 'd probably hate it . " " Why do you say that ? " She shrugged . " You seem too ... sophisticated . " He did n't know if that was a compliment or a criticism . " Sometimes you ca n't go home . I think I read that in a book once . Besides , you look like a New Orleans kind of woman to me . " " I love New Orleans . It 's a wonderful place to come for dinner . " " But it wo n't ever be home . " " No . " " So , are you the town doctor ? " " One of several , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very fancy , but there 's a real need . So many of the people do n't have the resources to get regular medical care . " " Sounds like they 're very lucky to have you . " She shook her head . " Oh , no , I 'm the lucky one . " Then she laughed . " That sounded saintly , did n't it ? I am the lucky one , though . The people are wonderful , at least I think they are , and they give me far more than I can give them . " When she spoke , her whole face lit up . " You know what I 'm going to like best ? " " What 's that ? " " No games . For the most part , they 're honest , ordinary people trying to scrape a living together . They do n't waste a lot of time on foolishness . " " So , everyone loves everyone else ? " He scoffed at the notion . " No , of course not , " she replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sneak up behind me and blindside me . It is n't their style . " She smiled again . " They 'll get right in my face , and I 'm going to like that . Like I said , no games . After the residency I just finished , that 's going to be a refreshing change . " " You wo n't miss the big beautiful office and all the trappings ? " " Not really . There are rewards other than money . Oh sure , it would be great to have the supplies and equipment we need , but we 'll make do . I 've spent a lot of years getting ready for this ... besides , I made a promise . " He kept asking her questions to keep her talking . He was interested in hearing about her town but not nearly as much as he was fascinated with her expressions . There were such passion and joy in her voice , and her eyes sparkled as she talked about her family and friends and the good she hoped she could do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had first started practicing the law , before he 'd become so cynical . He too had wanted to change the world , to make it a better place . Rebecca had changed all that . Looking back , he realized he had failed miserably . " I 've worn you out , going on and on about my hometown . I 'll let you rest now , " she said . " When can I get out of here ? " " That 's Dr. Cooper 's call , but if it were up to me , I 'd keep you another night . You had quite a nasty infection . You need to take it easy for a couple of weeks , and do n't forget to take your antibiotics . Good luck , Theo . " And then she was gone , and he 'd lost the only chance he had to find out more about her . He did n't even know where her home was . He fell asleep trying to figure out a way to see her again .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
