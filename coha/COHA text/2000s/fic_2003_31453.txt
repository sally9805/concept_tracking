Chapter One " How utterly delightful ! " exclaimed Richelieu . " I 've never seen a cat with such delicate features . The coloration is marvelous , as well . " For a moment , the aristocratic and intellectual face of France 's effective ruler dissolved into something much more youthful . Richelieu ignored Rebecca Stearns entirely , for a few seconds , as his forefinger played with the little paws of the kitten in his lap . Rebecca had just presented it to Richelieu as a diplomatic gift . He raised his head , smiling . " A ' Siamese , ' you call it ? Surely you have not managed to establish trade relations with southeast Asia in such a short time ? Even given your mechanical genius , that would seem almost another miracle . " Rebecca pondered that smile , for a moment , while she marshaled her answer . One thing , if nothing else , had become quite clear to her in the few short minutes since she had been ushered in to a private audience with the cardinal . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man she had ever met in her life . Or , at least , the shrewdest . And quite charming , in person-that she had not expected . The combination of that keen intellect and the personal warmth and grace was disarming to someone like Rebecca , with her own basically intellectual temperament . She reminded herself , very firmly , that being disarmed in the presence of Richelieu was the one thing she could least afford . For all his brains and his charm , the cardinal was almost certainly the most dangerous enemy her nation faced at the moment . And while she did not think Richelieu was cruel by nature , he had demonstrated before that he was quite prepared to be utterly ruthless when advancing what he considered the interests of his own nation . La gloire de France was a phrase which rang splendidly-but , like a sword , had a sharp edge to those who stood in the way . She decided to pursue the double meaning implicit in the cardinal 's last sentence . " ' Another ' miracle ? " she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eminence . As I recall , the most recent characterization you gave the Ring of Fire was ' witchcraft . ' " Richelieu 's gentle smile remained as steady as it had been since she entered his private audience chamber . " A misunderstanding , " he insisted , wiggling his fingers dismissively . Then , paused for a moment to admire the kitten batting at the long digits . " My error , and I take full responsibility for it . Always a mistake , you know , to jump to conclusions based on scant evidence . And I fear I was perhaps too influenced at the time by the views of Father Joseph . You met him yesterday , I believe , during your audience with the king ? " Another double meaning was buried in that sentence as well . Subtly , Richelieu was reminding Rebecca that her alternative to dealing with him was the rather childish King Louis XIII-or , even worse , the religious fanatic Father Joseph . The Capucin monk was close to Richelieu , and was also the leader of the harshly intolerant Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Sacrament . Rebecca controlled the natural impulse of an intellectual to talk . In this , as in so many things , her far less intellectual husband had trained her . Mike Stearns was a trade union leader in his origins . So , unlike Rebecca , he had learned long ago that the best tactic in negotiations is often simply to say nothing . " Let the other side do most of the talking , " he 'd told her . " On average , I 'd say anyone 's twice as likely to screw up with their mouth open than closed . " The cardinal , of course , was quite familiar with the ploy himself . Silence lengthened in the room . For an intellectual , silence is the ultimate sin . So , again , Rebecca found herself forced to keep it zipped ! She took refuge in memories of her husband . Mike , standing in the doorway to their house in Grantville , his face somewhat drawn and unhappy , as he bid her farewell on her diplomatic journey to France and Holland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , in their bed . Something in the smile which came to her face at that memory defeated the cardinal . Richelieu 's smile never wavered , true . But he did take a deep breath and , gently but firmly , set the kitten down on the floor and left off his idle playing . " The ' Ring of Fire , ' as you call it-which brought your ' Americans ' and their bizarre technology into our world-was enough to confuse anyone , madame . But further reflection , especially with further evidence to base it upon , has led me to the conclusion that I was quite in error to label your ... ah , if you will forgive the term , bizarre new country the product of ' witchcraft . ' " Richelieu paused for a moment , running his fingers down his rich robes . " Quite inexcusable on my part , really . Once I had time to ponder the matter , I realized that I had veered perilously close to Manicheanism . " With a little chuckle : " And how long has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half , ha ! And here I claim to be a cardinal ! " Rebecca decided it was safe enough to respond to the witticism with a little chuckle of her own . Nothing more than that , though . She could practically feel the cardinal 's magnetic personality drawing her in , and did n't doubt for a moment that Richelieu understood the power of his own charm quite well . By all accounts , the cardinal was a chaste man . But ' seduction ' was a term which had more than one application . Time after time , Richelieu 's rise to power and influence had been eased by that personal grace and charm-and , with other intellectuals , the suppleness of his mind . Were she not , for all practical purposes , the envoy of a nation at war with Richelieu , she would have enjoyed immensely spending a few hours with one of Christendom 's most prodigious intellects discussing the theological implications of the strange event which had brought an entire town of people into 17th-century Europe from a place centuries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silence , woman ! Obey your husband ! And that thought , too , reinforced her own serene smile . In truth , Mike Stearns was very far removed from a " patriarch . " He would be amused , Rebecca knew , when she told him of her self-admonition . ( " I will be good God-damned . You mean that for once you listened to me ? " ) It was another little defeat for Richelieu . Something in the set of his smile-a trace of stiffness-told her so . Again , the cardinal ran fingers down his robe , and resumed speaking . " No , only God could have caused such an incredible transposition of Time and Space . And your term ' the Ring of Fire ' seems appropriate . " Very serene , now , his smile . " As I 'm sure you are aware , I have long had my agents investigating your ' United States ' in Thuringia . Several of them have interviewed local inhabitants who witnessed the event . And , indeed , they too-simple peasants-saw the heavens open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in a small part of central Germany . " Still- " he said , abruptly , holding up a hand as if to forestall Rebecca 's next words . ( Which , in fact , she 'd had no intention of speaking . ) " Still , the fact that the event was of divine origin does not lead to any certain conclusion as to its purpose . " And here it comes , thought Rebecca . The new and official party line . She was privileged , she realized . Her conversations with the courtiers at the royal audience the night before had made clear to her that France 's elite was still groping for a coherent ideological explanation for the appearance of Grantville in the German province of Thuringia . Having now survived for two years-not to mention defeating several attacking armies in the process , at least one of them funded and instigated by France-the Americans and the new society they were forging could no longer be dismissed as hearsay . And the term " witchcraft " was ... petty , ultimately . Richelieu , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first one to hear it . " Have you considered the history of the world which created your Americans ? " asked Richelieu . " As I 'm sure you also know , I 've obtained " - here came another dismissive wiggle of the finger- " through various means , several of the historical accounts which your Americans brought with them . And I 've studied them all , very thoroughly . " That 's a given , thought Rebecca . Somewhat glumly , because it was only a " given " in retrospect . At the time , it had never occurred to her , or Mike , or any of the leaders of their new United States , that history books would rapidly become one of the most prized objects for espionage . Technical books , yes ; blueprints , yes ; anything which would enable the United States ' opponents to steal some of their incredible new technology . But ... high school history textbooks ? In retrospect , of course , the thing was obvious . Any ruler or political figure in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see what lay in store for them in the immediate years to come . And the consequences of that knowledge would be truly incalculable . If a king knows what will happen a year or two from now , after all , he will take measures to make sure that it either happens more quickly-if he likes the development-or does n't happen at all , if otherwise . And in so doing , of course , will rapidly scramble the sequence of historical events which led to that original history in the first place . It was the old quandary of time travel , which Rebecca herself had studied in the science fiction novels which the town of Grantville had brought with it also . And , like her husband , she had come to the conclusion that the Ring of Fire had created a new and parallel universe to the one from which Grantville-and the history which produced it-had originally come . As she ruminated , Richelieu had been studying her . The intelligent dark brown eyes brought their own glum feeling . And do not think for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that . He , too , understands that the history which was will now never be-but also understands that he can still discern broad patterns in those events . And guide France accordingly . His next words confirmed it . " Of course , the exact events will be different . But the basic framework of that future world is clear enough . I believe we can summarize it with that term you favor so much : democracy . Or , as I would put it , rule by the masses . Because , to be frank , all the various political structures which that future world exhibits show the same basic characteristic . The authority of an established aristocracy and royalty discarded ; all power vested in the ' people ' ; whether that people be called ' citizens ' or ' the proletariat ' or ' the Volk . ' No rein , no check , no limits of any kind placed upon their desires and ambitions . " The wiggling fingers , this time , were not so much dismissive as demonstrative . " All the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Jews , to name just one instance . The atrocities committed by such obvious monsters as Stalin and those Asian fellows . Mao and Pol Pot , if I recall the names correctly . And-let us not forget-the destruction of entire cities and regions by regimes which , though perhaps not as despotic , were no less prepared to wreak havoc upon the world . I will remind you , madame , that the United States of America which you seem determined to emulate in this universe did not shrink for an instant from incinerating the cities of Japan-or cities in Germany , for that matter , who are now your neighbors . Half a million people-more likely a million , all told-exterminated like so many insects . " Rebecca practically clamped her jaws shut . Her instincts were to shriek argument in response . Yes ? And the current devastation which you have unleashed on Germany ? The Thirty Years War will kill more Germans than either world war of the 20th century ! Not to mention the millions of children who die in your precious aristocratic world every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be quickly remedied ! But she remained true to her husband 's advice . There was no point in arguing with Richelieu . He was not advancing a hypothesis to be tested , here . He was simply letting the envoy from the United States know that the conflict was not over , and would not be over , until one or the other side triumphed . For all the charm , and civility , and the serenity of the smile , Richelieu was issuing a declaration of war . And , indeed , his next words : " So it all now seems clear to me . Yes , God created the Ring of Fire . Absurd to label such a miraculous event a thing of petty ' witchcraft . ' But he did so in order to warn us of the perils of the future , that we might be armed to avoid them . That we might be steeled in our resolve to create a world based on the sure principles of monarchy , aristocracy , and an established church . Perils of which , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrespect , and implying no personal sinfulness-are both the agents and the embodiment . " The cardinal rose gracefully to his feet and gave Rebecca a polite bow . " And now , I 'm afraid , I must attend to the king 's business . I hope you enjoy your stay in Paris , and if I may be of any assistance please call upon me . How soon do you plan to depart for Holland ? And by what means ? " As quickly as I can , by any route available . But she restricted herself to a hesitant , almost girlish : " I 'm not really sure . Travel from here to Holland is difficult , given the nature of the times . " Richelieu 's charm was back in full force , as he escorted her to the door . " I strongly urge you to take the land route . The Channel-even the North Sea-is plagued with piracy . I can provide you with an escort to the border of the Spanish Netherlands , and I 'm quite sure I can arrange a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spain are antagonists at the moment . But despite what you may have heard , my personal relations with Archduchess Isabella are quite good . I am certain the Spaniards will not place any obstacles in the way . " The statement was ridiculous , of course . The very last thing the Spaniards would want to see was a diplomatic mission headed by the wife of the President of the United States perched in Holland , which the Spaniards had been trying to reconquer for half a century . Little , that United States might be . In physical size , simply the old regions of Thuringia and western Franconia-a small enough piece of Germany . Granted , by German standards the United States was an important principality . Only Saxony had a larger population . But its population was not even remotely as large as either France or Spain 's .
