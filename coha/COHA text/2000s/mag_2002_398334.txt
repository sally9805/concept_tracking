On trial for stealing from Diana , ex-aide Paul Burrell could spill royal beans // Ushered into their late mother 's apartment in Kensington Palace shortly before Christmas 1997 , Princes William and Harry were greeted by the family butler , Paul Burrell , who had dutifully tidied Diana 's home in the months since her death . As the boys solemnly looked around , Burrell comforted them while they selected items that had belonged to their mother to take with them . " They came in , " Burrell later said , " and chose something special . " Nowadays , William and Harry have cause to wonder whether Burrell might have chosen a few special items for himself . On Oct. 14 the former butler-the man Diana once called " my rock " - will stand trial on charges of stealing 328 items worth an estimated $7.5 million from Diana and her family . In the time since Burrell 's January 2001 arrest , Britain has buzzed with the prospect that Charles or William might be called to testify . ( Lawyers for both sides now say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Burrell , 44 , was Diana 's confidant , the defense case could lay bare much of what he witnessed during his 10-year tenure as her closest aide , a period that paralleled her imploding marriage to Charles and assorted romances . Even before the trial gets under way , interest in the case has stirred up sordid new tales , including an alleged rape at St. James 's Palace involving two male staffers . " There 'll be dirt everywhere , " predicts a royal observer . " Paul Burrell knows everything . " Photograph Scotland Yard investigators say that Burrell ( leaving court in London in January ) committed the thefts " on or before June 1998 .

" They were not on display in Mr. Burrell 's house , nor even looked at , but were kept safe , " says defense lawyer Andrew Shaw . Several of Diana 's friends back Burrell 's claim of the princess 's generosity . " Diana was given so much on a daily basis , " says a Di confidante , " that she could n't possibly keep everything . " Others find that explanation implausible . " This is not a few trinkets , " says a Spencer family friend . Diana 's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale , 47 , and her mother , Frances Shand Kydd , 66 , are both expected to testify for the prosecution .

Says a Burrell pal : " It has put some wind in his sails to think he has people on his side . " For a while it looked as though Burrell might even have a friend in Prince Charles . He invited the ex-butler to meet with him near his Highgrove estate for a private chat in August 2001-only to withdraw the invitation when a polo accident sent him to the hospital as Burrell was en route . Ultimately the case is being driven not by either family but by the police , who stumbled upon the cache of allegedly stolen goods when they went to Burrell 's house while investigating items missing from Diana 's estate . Says someone close to the case : " There would not be a court case over one or two letters , but this involves a large quantity . " Even so , neither family is said to be eager for the glare of a trial . " Everybody feels that not much good can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is Burrell-his reputation tarnishing faster than an overlooked tea service-who has most at stake . The theft charges have drawn out critics of the former butler , with British journalists suggesting that his days with Diana may have been numbered . The Spencer family , who rewarded his loyalty after Diana 's 1997 death by creating a codicil to her will granting him $82,000 , is said to have soured on him even before the arrest . " They became upset when he started taking on the mantle of Diana , saying I 'm the rock ' and that sort of thing , " says a royal observer . Burrell , who drew on his Palace experience to write a ' ' 99 etiquette book , sticks by the moniker , noting that " it 's Diana 's word , and I hang on to that . " Diana was 19 and dating Prince Charles when she first met Burrell , a coal-truck driver 's son who was just 22 , when he was working as a footman at Balmoral Castle in Scotland . " I found her wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEOPLE in 1999 . " She asked if I could stay and have a chat because it was awfully lonely in here , ' and our friendship began there and then . " Over the years , working for " the Boss , " as he called her , " was like a roller coaster . She was a perfectionist and expected the best from everyone around her . " Supporters point out that Burrell , who now runs a small flower shop in North Wales , has long refused sevenfigure offers to pen a Diana tell-all . " He could have written the definitive Diana book , " Louise Cosgrove , Burrell 's niece , said after his arrest . " That says a lot about his character . " Under oath Burrell may feel compelled to speak out to prove just how much the princess confided in him . " Once it goes to court , " says a source close to Burrell , " everything will be fair game . " Which would hardly have pleased his former boss . " Diana told me in the last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Paul , " says entrepreneur Roberto Devorik , a friend of Di 's . " She said , He is with me because he really loves me . He is the only person I really trust .
