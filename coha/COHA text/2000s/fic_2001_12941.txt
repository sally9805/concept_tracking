OPENING SCENE : Music : Hard Bop . The Victorious living room . We hear knocking on the door . At first there is no immediate answer . Then we see Mrs. VICTORIOUS entering from the kitchen ; she is wiping her hand on a dish cloth . ) MRS . VICTORIOUS Come in , son . You look beat up . KUMAKO Beat 's not the word . How you doing , Mama ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Fine . KUMAKO Mama , you ca n't fool me ? I know this is not the real you . MRS . VICTORIOUS You sensibilities are growing . I knew it was you and I did n't want you to leave . I 'll be right back . ( Mrs. VICTORIOUS goes back into the kitchen . KUMAKO I expected Dad to open the door . Where is he ? MRS . VICTORIOUS He 's on one of our secret missions again . KUMAKO Guess you never get use to him being away so often . MRS . VICTORIOUS I 'm use to it a little bit . . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollers out . ) Cup a tea ? KUMAKO I'ou n't want to put you out . MRS . VICTORIOUS You would n't be our child if you did n't put us out . ( Mrs. VICTORIOUS enters with one different-colored piece of clothing on than she when she first appeared . She also has two cups of tea in her hands . p. 3 KUMAKO Thanks , Mama . Has Peseshet been by lately . Or is she too busy over at the hospital ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Stop that . Leave your sistuh alone . She has her responsibility just like you do . You look a little worried around the eyes ? KUMAKO Have you been keeping up with the news about the airport murder ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Not much . I have n't concentrated on it since hearing about it . KUMAKO I really need to talk with Dad about this . MRS . VICTORIOUS Why ? Am not good enough to hear it ? KUMAKO No , ma'am . I do n't want you jumping into my case . Like the last two cases I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape victim and I was in Beltzhoover , three miles away , investigating a drug deal that had went wrong and three young males were brutally assassinated , and you were in two places at the same time . How do you do that ? And when I 'm going to learn to do the things Dad and you do . After all I 'm the son of Maroon parents . MRS . VICTORIOUS Do n't forget your sistuh . KUMAKO Peschet too . I Every since I can remember she was doing weird things . MRS . VICTORIOUS Not weird . Different . Our ancestors never lived among our enemies . They never knew floggings , the whip , or enslavement . Our legacy is who we are spiritually . We do things differently than our enslaved and colonized people do . When your time is ripe , you 'll be able to do what you need to do . . p. 4 KUMAKO I 've yet to believe all that Afrikan superstitions yet , Mama . MRS . VICTORIOUS That 's your weakness , son . About this murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with links . ( Takes out small notebook . ) The victim was James Otis Hathaway . Black man . Thirty two years old . Body found in the short-term parking lot at the Pittsburgh International Airport . He was killed In broad daylight too . MRS . VICTORIOUS And no one saw anything . KUMAKO If so , no one e has come forward yet . MRS . VICTORIOUS How was he killed ? KUMAKO Throat slashed from ear to ear . As of today , no similar weapon that marches the wound on his neck has been found within miles of the airport . I mean , we searched everywhere a car might pull off the side of the room or someone would toss a knife out of speeding car . . I doubt if he would get out of his car and attempt to bury it en route anywhere . Captain Wilford believes the weapon has to be in the vicinity . Do n't ask me why . That 's his thing . MISS VICTORIOUS Why ? Does he know something you do n't ? KUMAKO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing , playing detective over me . Matter of fact , he plans on bringing in the FBI . Because the Klan has been holding regular meetings out that way . I think he 's trying to connect it with a hate or racial crime theory of his . p. 5 MRS . VICTORIOUS That is Klan country . Do n't you go out there being a detective , hear me ? KUMAKO If I have to , Mama , I got to . MRS . VICTORIOUS Boy , all you have to do in this country is pay taxes and stay Maroon . . KUMAKO salutes her . Yes , ma'am . MRS . VICTORIOUS I 'd go down in hell to get someone who mess with my blood . KUMAKO Cut that out , Mama , nobody 's going to mess with me . MRS . VICTORIOUS Better not . And you better not put yourself in that kind of situation either . You hear me ? KUMAKO ( Pats his chest over his heart ) I got you right here . MRS . VICTORIOUS Anything turn up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hathaway was killed about an half hour , give or take twenty minutes , before his body was discovered . MRS . VICTORIOUS Anyone who acted suspicious ? KUMAKO Nope . Not even the two workers at the ticket gate could be of any help . Nothing . Not a thing close to connecting anyone to the victim . The perpetrator was stone lucky . p. 6 MRS . VICTORIOUS Where was he when he was killed ? KUMAKO He was sitting behind the steering wheel of his car . MRS . VICTORIOUS Anything unusual about that ? KUMAKO Not that I could come up with . The only possible evidence we have were broken pieces of glass . The lab 's still trying to identify where they could 've came from . MRS . VICTORIOUS Glass ? Window broken ? KUMAKO No . The pieces does n't seem to have any connection with the car or anything in the car . We 're stumped right now . MRS . VICTORIOUS We 'll come back to that when we get more information and it is definitely identified . What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him James ; you called him Jamie , why ? How did you know that was his real name ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Did you mention Jamie was his name ? KUMAKO No , Ma'am . I distinctly said James . . . MRS . VICTORIOUS I do n't know where I got Jamie from ; someone whispered that name in my ear . KUMAKO I wish someone would whisper something in my ear . Well , anyway , I 've interviewed half of the folk on the Hill , especially the eighteen hundred block of Ledlie Street where the victim lived . The consensus was that Mr. Hathaway was a private person . Quiet . Kept mostly to himself . He had few close buddies . But they seem to know very little about him . We do know he was from Alabama . p. 7 MRS . VICTORIOUS Women friends ? KUMAKO Now that 's one thing I found strange . MRS . VICTORIOUS Yes ? KUMAKO Women who knew him seemed to pretend they knew him well . But when I questioned them , they said little that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he talked freely about himself with his neighbors ; women or otherwise . from looking at photos of him , I think women would say he was a good looking or handsome man . Oh , a strange thing about his apartment . MRS . VICTORIOUS The suspense 's killing me . KUMAKO He had a lot of photos , mostly of Black men , in his photo album . MRS . VICTORIOUS Who were that ? Family ? KUMAKO No , these were photos of Black male entertainers . MRS . VICTORIOUS Interesting . Intriguing . KUMAKO My friend Debbie Lee at Homewood library helped me ; she knew them quite well . Umm . . . ( showing his mother photos ) . . . Jackie Wilson , Sam Cooke , Little Willie John , Johnny Ace , Clyde McPhatter . . this one we could n't identify . I 'm researching . . . MRS . VICTORIOUS Nolan Strong . p. 8 KUMAKO Huh ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Nolan Strong and the Diablos. out of Detroit . These are old rhythm and blues singers . Handsome men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them have what they used to call processes in their hair . Except for , Marvin Gaye . MRS . VICTORIOUS Jamie could have been living some kind of fantasy . Was he gay ? KUMAKO No proof of that yet . But he could have been . That is a lead I 'm pursuing tho . They were all good looking Black man , that 's for sure . Even the victim 's driver license 's photo flattered his looks . Amazing . Anyone as handsome as he was , if he was n't gay , there has to be women implicated somewhere down the line . I feel this is a line of traceability . MRS . VICTORIOUS Some Black men have killing looks ; worth a woman killing over . In my life I 've seen a few of them . Forget I said that , son . KUMAKO I think i mention this Dad . ( Holds up his palms . ) Opps , none of my business , right ? I must remember I 'm the off-spring . MRS . VICTORIOUS You 're learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings. ) p. 9 MRS . VICTORIOUS Hello . ( Pause . ) Where are you now ? ( Pause . ) No , you go ahead . I 'm fine . Kumako 's here . He got a big case he needs some help with . ( Pause ) I 'll tell him . ( Pause ) All right , see you when you get home . Call me when your train gets in . Sleep tight . Love you . ( Pause ) Sure . Bye-bye . KUMAKO I wanted to say hello to Dad . MRS . VICTORIOUS He 's running late for his gypsy cab . I 'll have him call you when he gets in . KUMAKO Thanks , Mom , I really want to talk with him . Is he all right ? MRS . VICTORIOUS He 's doing real well . KUMAKO Taking his medications ? MRS . VICTORIOUS He just has leave that fried chicken alone and eat more fresh vegetables when he 's on the road like that . I keep telling him that chicken wings are cancerous . KUMAKO You two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're leaving ? I thot . . . KUMAKO Have some possible suspects to interview the first thing in the morning . MRS . VICTORIOUS With whom ? p. 10 KUMAKO Now , this is odd twist in this case . MRS . VICTORIOUS if there are twists in the case , it is your responsibility to straighten them out . KUMAKO The only thing that our man Jamie Hathaway did on regular bases was to go to church . MRS . VICTORIOUS What church ? KUMAKO The Holy Judgment Day Church . It 's down around Monaca and Cliff streets in the Hill District . . Non-denomination , I 'm told . The pastor 's name is Reverend Michael L. Cameron . MRS . VICTORIOUS How did you come up with that connection ? KUMAKO Church 's Bible in Hathaway 's apartment . Literature with the church 's name on it were found everywhere ; in his car , and in each of the rooms of his three-roomed apartment , including the bathroom . MRS . VICTORIOUS Of course forensic and you went over this room . KUMAKO As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell you anything ? KUMAKO Some . Got enough rubber-neck Jones in the building to fill a baseball stadium . MRS . VICTORIOUS You have to be able to distinguish fact from gossip . p. 11 KUMAKO A lot of that was floating around . If a man has as many women friends as I 've been told Hathaway had , he had to have an appointment and/or an address book . MRS . VICTORIOUS Unless he memorized anything . You never found a book or a tablet. ? KUMAKO Nope . Looked everywhere . Nothing was found on his body , in his car , or his apartment . If there was something , I think someone beat me to it . ( Pulls out a piece of paper . ) This is the only think I found in his own handwriting . MRS . VICTORIOUS reading.Mabel Fuller . This her phone number ? KUMAKO It 's hers . The telephone company supplied us with a name and address . I have an appointment with her to morrow . Out of curiosity , I already called it and check it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Geraldine Fuller answered the phone . Well , Mama , it 's getting late . Early bird gets the worm . MRS . VICTORIOUS Too bad , son , you only have your books and your music to go come to . KUMAKO Mama , I 'm happy . MRS .. VICTORIOUS Oh , by the way , whatever happen to that girl you were seeing with the Akan name ? KUMAKO She repatriated to Ghana . Mama , I 'm all right that way . p. 12 MRS . VICTORIOUS I just hope you do n't run into one of them killing love females . KUMAKO Oh , I got that covered ; I can see when my eyes are closed . MRS . VICTORIOUS That 's because you were borne with seven veils over your eyes . That 's your cultural gift . To see the essence of a person by connecting with her soul . Still , be careful . Watch what you eat . If a woman wants you , she could put something in your food and you will hers as long as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are too many mischievous spirits who never really grew up and matured . They are like little children . KUMAKO Do n't worry , Mama . These Westernized women do n't know the first think about Afrikan traditional ways . I 'm safe . And I have the ancestors , Da , Pesechet , a and you peering over my shoulders . MRS . VICTORIOUS When you get yours , you 'll be greater than all of us . You have intelligent eyes , but you have to control your passions . KUMAKO Me ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Yes , you . One day , you 'll you 'll have to go before the crossroads and you 'll be able to see all ways at once . That 's your cultural gift . Only a few have achieved that . You will , one day , be able to see into the souls of human beings . p. 13 KUMAKO Ok , Maroon Mama , whatever you say . MRS . VICTORIOUS See , I still do n't know why we came to live among our enemies . KUMAKO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . KUMAKO Love you to life . MRS . VICTORIOUS Our love is yours too . ( Next day . Lights out and come up on Reverend Michael L. CAMERON and GILBERT CALLOWAY , church 's secretary . ) MUSIC : " Sexy Ways " by Hank Ballard and the Midnighters . Oldies radio station . ) REVEREND CAMERON Gilbert , how many times do I have to tell you , you ca n't play that kind of music on the church grounds . ( GILBERT sings to the song . ) Change the radio station . GILBERT changing the radio to a Gospel station.The Lawd moves my hand in a mysterious way . REVEREND CAMERON Do n't I have an appointment this morning ? GILBERT Yes . It 's right there on your desk , Reverend . REVEREND CAMERON But not in my head where it should be . GILBERT That 's what you have a secretary for . . You have a meeting in exactly three minutes with a police office , Detective Kumako Victorious . p. 14 REVEREND CAMERON An unusual name . Could you tell his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . REVEREND CAMERON Afrikan American ? GILBERT He 's a cop ; he 's Colored . They all the same : blue before Black . Oh , before I forget , my wife had a unusual name . REVEREND CAMERON I thot you were a single man . GILBERT Married for seven months and fourteen and half days . She was a good woman , but I loved her much too hard for her likes . Unfortunately , after we had our marriage annulled , she had an asthma attack and just never recovered from it . I have n't met anyone like her yet . REVEREND CAMERON You 're still a young man . Pray . GILBERT I pray for that every night . Reverend , you think my praying will keep a woman in my arms ? REVEREND CAMERON I do . GILBERT Is that what keeps Mrs. Cameron in your arms ? REVEREND CAMERON The Lord answers our prayers . What time you have now ? Which reminds me , I thot you were going to pick up my watch from the repair shop a week ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll get it . REVEREND CAMERON That 's good news . I 'm lost without my watch . I have to appear at the African Americans Against Police Brutality 's press later this morning . I ca n't afford to be late . GILBERT Your docket 's filling up . It 's a wonder you have time for Mrs. Cameron . I know that 's none of my business . So ah you have to meet with the Nurses Auxiliary . Mabel Fuller headed Auxiliary , but since she 's moved out of the city she does n't attend church here anymore . REVEREND CAMERON drop in on their next meeting and give them my penny 's worth . GILBERT All right with me . And you need to get on the board and the church about this new building fund . REVEREND CAMERON The construction decisions were being narrowed down to two ; I . . . GILBERT I 'm telling you Reverend , the Black community 's not going to stand for hiring two separate white contractors to build a Black church in the dead center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Black church . . . REVEREND CAMERON Gilbert . I get the idea . You 're really Black Black today , are n't you ? GILBERT Protecting our people 's interest , that 's all .

Leave you two gentlemen to discuss your business . REVEREND CAMERON tapping his wrist.Gilbert , my watch . GILBERT I know , pick up your wrist watch . Nice meeting you , detective . KUMAKO Oh , you 'll be seeing me again . You can count on it . GILBERT Not guilty . I 'm a book without a cover . KUMAKO I 'll have a few questions for you . I 'll be in contact with So no sudden trips to Afrika . GILBERT Why would I want to go to Afrika ; I ai n't left nuthin ' in Afrika . I 'm better off here in America than I would be in Afrika . That do n't have Oprah or Pam Grier in Afrika . REVEREND CAMERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer just wants to ask you a few questions . GILBERT I did it Cap'n Columbo . I confess . KUMAKO Did what ? GILBERT Stole the cookie from the cookie jar , of course . REVEREND CAMERON Gilbert , please . . . p. 18 GILBERT I 'm gone . KUMAKO Funny secretary there . REVEREND CAMERON Gilbert 's really harmless as a butterfly . Well , Mr. Victorious , what 's this all about ? Your visit , that is ? KUMAKO You know ah James Hathaway . REVEREND CAMERON Hathaway . Jamie Hathaway . . . No , ca n't rightly say I do . . KUMAKO You certain ? Want to take a few minutes to think on it before you swear on a Bible ?

New members come into the Word practically very Sunday . My mind is full of faces and names . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James . . . Hathaway . ( Pause . ) No . Does n't ring a bell . KUMAKO handing him a photo.Maybe this will help . He was murdered . REVEREND CAMERON Murdered ? KUMAKO You do n't watch the news or read the newspapers ? p. 19 REVEREND CAMERON I do . But murder does n't stick in my head . Do n't get me wrong , detective , I 'm not de-sensitized to killings . Not 3 months go by when I 'm not preaching a funeral . Young Black males have no spiritual foundation these days . Very few of them attend church . I 'm in disfavor with some church members about burying some of them from our church . Blacks killing Blacks are everyday occurrence in this community . KUMAKO Yes , sir . REVEREND CAMERON If we do not get on the ship of salvation , then we are all doomed . The fires will fall down from heaven and even the rocks will not be spared damnation . KUMAKO Did you know that the late Mr. Hathaway attended your church ? REVEREND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KUMAKO I am . But I was hoping you could verify it . REVEREND CAMERON You want that right now . I could have Gilbert check our church records . . . KUMAKO Would you please look at the photo again to make sure you do n't know him . REVEREND CAMERON handing the photo back to KUMAKO.Do n't know him . If he is  --  was  --  a member of the church , I do n't recall him . p. 20 KUMAKO I see . REVEREND CAMERON By the tone of your voice , I feel you do n't believe me . KUMAKO No , sir , I have no reason to doubt you . REVEREND CAMERON Am I a suspect ? KUMAKO Why would you be a suspect ? REVEREND CAMERON Then this is not a murder interrogation ? KUMAKO It is . I would like to speak with Mrs. Cameron ? REVEREND CAMERON She 's not involved in this . KUMAKO I did n't say that . You think she 's involved ? REVEREND CAMERON No way . KUMAKO You sound very defensive about her not being involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , you know . KUMAKO I have n't implied anything , sir . If I have , forgive me . It is not my intention to be disrespectful to your wife . REVEREND CAMERON more in disbelief than a question.You plan to question my wife . KUMAKO Is there a reason why I should n't ? p. 21 REVEREND CAMERON Wait a minute . Is there a reason why you should ? ( KUMAKO does n't respond . ) What-what does my wife have to do with all this ? KUMAKO By all this you mean the murder or the deceased ? REVEREND CAMERON I-I do n't know what I mean . You 're very confusing , Detective Victorious . KUMAKO Do n't mean to be . May I speak with your wife , sir ? REVEREND CAMERON My wife . Excuse me for a second while I call Gilbert . KUMAKO For what ? REVEREND CAMERON I thot you wanted to know if . . he . . . the dead man . . . was a member of the church . . . KUMAKO It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I believe he said he had something to do for you . Oh , I ask that you not discuss anything we discussed with anyone . REVEREND CAMERON My wife 's a very inquisitive person . She 'll be curious about all this . KUMAKO At this point in my investigation , I would like to maintain a little confidentiality . REVEREND CAMERON Really ? Secrecy , you mean ? p. 22 KUMAKO A matter of professional curtsy , so to speak . We 're both servants of the people . REVEREND CAMERON I save souls . What do you save , Detective Victorious . KUMAKO In my own way , Reverend Cameron , I save souls . Matter of fact , my whole family 's mission is to save souls . REVEREND CAMERON Maybe , when this is all over , we could sit down and discourse your contention that you save souls . KUMAKO I will consider that an invitation and a challenge . REVEREND CAMERON Anything else ? KUMAKO Do n't mean to inconvenience you too much , Reverend . I have to do my job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , I came first to speak to you out of respect for your spiritual calling . . . REVEREND CAMERON I appreciate that . KUMAKO Someone from the D. A.s ' office will be here before the morning 's gone to ask you some additional questions and take your fingerprints . REVEREND CAMERON I thot you said I was n't a suspect ? KUMAKO There 's a lot of unidentifiable fingerprints in the victim 's apartment ; they 're trying to match them as quickly as they can . So be on guard when they do show . If they insist upon taking blood samples for DNA testing from you , get yourself a lawyer before saying or doing anything further . p. 23 REVEREND CAMERON Well , I got the Lord on my side . He protects me every day of my life ; He 's my law enforcer . Let me find Gilbert . ( REVEREND exists . ) KUMAKO aloneI guess he put my shoes on . Watch my mouth .

It 's a long story . Let 's say , my accent has elements of Afrikan and elements of American  --  as is my history and culture . MRS . CAMERON Interesting . KUMAKO I would like to meet with you this evening after 6 to talk . MRS . CAMERON Mikey ? REVEREND CAMERON It 's ok , dear . He 's just doing his . . . job , right ? p. 24 MRS . CAMERON Could you tell me what this is all about ? KUMAKO Just a few questions , Mrs. Cameron . MRS . CAMERON This evening , you say ? Between five and seven , will be okay with me . KUMAKO Let 's make it 6:30 . MRS . CAMERON Fine . KUMAKO Can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMERON Of course . Could n't think of a better place . KUMAKO So , it 's a date . MRS . CAMERON Excuse me . KUMAKO Oh , sorry . A figure of speech , ma'am . ( Shakes the REVEREND 's hand . ) Thanks , Reverend Cameron , it 's a pleasure meeting you , sir . REVEREND CAMERON I pray there 's no pain in our meeting you , Detective . KUMAKO I look forward to our discourse , sir . REVEREND CAMERON None of this makes any sense to me . KUMAKO Give it time , Reverend . Nice meeting yall . I ' promise I 'll be on time . REVEREND CAMERON I 'll show you out . p. 25 KUMAKO Do n't worry . I know my way . Good sense of direction .

None of this makes any sense whatsoever to me . MRS . CAMERON What 's a policeman meeting with you about and setting up a meeting with me ? Mikey , What 's gong on really ? What was he doing here ? You know something and you 're not telling me . What ? Why ? REVEREND CAMERON That my dear is confidential . MRS . CAMERON Confidential ? Between us ? Nothing 's a secret between us , is there ? REVEREND CAMERON This time , it is . MRS . CAMERON I ca n't believe you . You serious too . Mikey , I want to know something before I meet with this policeman . Look at me , I 'm shaking . REVEREND CAMERON Why ? What do you have to fear ? p. 26 MRS . CAMERON The-the unknown . I 'm scared of him . That cop . Did you see his eyes ? REVEREND CAMERON What was wrong with his eyes ? MRS . CAMERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like he was staring straight into my soul . His eyes made me feel like I was in a confessional or something . I do n't like being in his eyes . REVEREND CAMERON You have nothing to confess to him about , do you ? MRS . CAMERON Absolutely not . REVEREND CAMERON Then , you 're just reacting to him . MRS . CAMERON I 'm telling you that man 's dangerous . I just met him and I feel defenseless around him . I'm-I 'm not going to meet with him . I 'm not . No . No . I mean it . REVEREND CAMERON Rosemary , you 're going to have to calm your nerves . Just answer his questions . I 've always had trust in you . MRS . CAMERON Huh ? Why do you bring that up now ?

Talking to your girlfriends on the phone every night is not much fun after while . . Let me tell you . KUMAKO i see . He hit on you . MABEL i would n't say it that way . KUMAKO How would you say it ? KUMAKO I 'd say he looked my way once or twice . Matter of fact , every Sunday , he sat in church in the far right seat where I 'd catch his eyes on me a number , quite a number of times , I must confess . p. 31 KUMAKO You ever been to his apartment ? MABEL Should n't I have an attorney present ? KUMAKO Why ? MABEL Am I a suspect in the death of Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being questioned by a homicide cop , a suspect ? KUMAKO Honesty would go along way on your behalf . After all , I do have evidence that he knew you . We can easily check with the phone company and see how many phone calls he 's made to your home and how may you have made to his apartment . MABEL Yall can do all that ? KUMAKO Jamie 's apartment is load with traces of everyone who ' has been there . Lost of evidence there . Fingerprints . Hair . Stains . . . MABEL Wait a minute . KUMAKO When was the last time you saw Jamie ? MABEL What 's today ? Tuesday ? Two weeks ago from yesterday . Yeah , that 's right . KUMAKO You seemed sure of the day ? MABEL My off days are Sundays and Mondays . And I - Jamie and I saw each other every two weeks on Mondays . We decided that was the best day of the week for us . I ca n't work and play all the time . You try keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full time job . A real job . So I divide my time . Make sure I spent quality time with my Gerri. p. 32 KUMAKO I admire you for that . MABEL You do ? KUMAKO in this business , so to speak , I see some things that can easily turn you against humanity and decency when it comes to morals and ethics . Sometimes people can become so psycopathetic and vain they care only about themselves . MABEL I care about my daughter ; I 'll do anything to protect her . KUMAKO To protect her against . . . ? MABEL Anything or anyone who would mistreat or harm her in any form or fashion . You would do the same for your offspring , would n't you , Mr. Victorious ? KUMAKO Kumako . MABEL Kumako . Pretty name . KUMAKO Thank you . And yes I would do anything to protect my offsprings , but since i do n't have any . . . MABEL A freeman , so to speak . KUMAKO Yes , so to speak . How do you spell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after her father . She likes to be call Gerri with a g , so she says . KUMAKO I spoke with her on the phone earlier before I found out what time you would be home and I set up a meeting with her tomorrow after she gets home from school . p. 33 MABEL With Gerri . Why ? She has nothing to do with . . . She 's just a kid . . . you ca n't bring her . . . into this . . . KUMAKO I 'm not accusing your daughter of anything . I just have a few questions to ask her . MABEL I guess I ca n't stop you from asking a few questions . But should n't I be present when you do ? After all , she 's still a minor and under my care . I 'm responsible for her actions . KUMAKO That 's a good thot . But , I 'm not charging her with anything . MABEL Still she 's underage and I 'm her mother ; I would like to be there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward if you were present and your daughter had something to tell me that she did n't want you to hear . I would like to give everyone I talk with the confidentiality that they deserve as human beings . MABEL I ca n't be there . . . ? KUMAKO I would feel better if you were not in the room with us , but you could be . . . here . . you know what I mean . . . MABEL Yes . I understand . KUMAKO Well , thank you for your assistance and kindness . MABEL is that all ? p. 34 KUMAKO For now . Oh , how much did you care for Jamie Hathaway ? MABEL You ever saw him ? KUMAKO Only in death . MABEL You have to be a female to understand the affect Jamie had on , not just me , but women period . . Sure , I cared a lot for Jamie . A lot . KUMAKO Did you have a killing love for him MABEL It never got that far . You know , come to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a thang for full-figured women , especially if they were taller than him . KUMAKO Like you . MABEL Does that help . KUMAKO Not yet . Maybe it will tho . MABEL I hope you catch the one who did Jamie in and put them under the jail . Give me the key and I 'll drop it in the Allegheny River . . KUMAKO I 'll be in contact with you . MABEL I 'm real excited . For some reason , you make me feel better abt myself . Oh , yes , Mr. Victorious , for your information , I never left any stains in Jamie 's apartment . Not one . Not even lipstick stains .

Everyone except Minister Louis Farrakhan . MRS . CAMERON I do n't believe my husband would go that far . KUMAKO Too bad . MRS . CAMERON You can take that up with Reverend Cameron  --  if you so desire . What exactly is it that you 're investigating ? KUMAKO Straight to the dance , I see . MRS . CAMERON I 'd rather not waste your time . Let 's start off at the cake table . KUMAKO You can make it sweet by you telling me about Jamie Hathaway and you . MRS .

KUMAKO Look , Mrs. Cameron , anything you say I can use it against you in the a court of law . . . p. 42 MRS . CAMERON You arresting me ? KUMAKO No , not exactly . But be careful . You 've already lied to me several times now . ( Handing her the photograph ) . Jamie and you have been identified together . You 've been identified by folk who lives in Jamie 's apartment building . The mailman has recognize you . You never know who 's watching you . . . a good looking , shapely woman as yourself is an obvious target of stares . . . and gossip . Jamie and you should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been identified as being in the Executive Club at the airport the day of Jamie 's murder . MRS . CAMERON My husband . . . what about Mikey . . . ? KUMAKO It depends how involved you were with Mr. Hathaway . When you hear or say Jamie 's name , your feelings for him is too obvious ; it 's written all over your face . I do n't want to assume anything . MRS . CAMERON My husband . . . KUMAKO I ca n't promise anything . But I might be able to help . MRS . CAMERON We-we , Jamie and I , were deep really into one another . KUMAKO Like husband and wife ? MRS . CAMERON Why do you put it that way ? p. 43 KUMAKO Does it offend you that way ? MRS . CAMERON Yes . Because we were not married . I think I would 've married him . . . there were a few times I wished we were married . . . KUMAKO Were you two having sex , Mrs. Cameron ? MRS .

I feel as tho you have my soul in the palm of your hands . . . toying with me . . . breathing on my soul . . . who are you . . . who . . ? I fear you more than I fear God . KUMAKO I would suggest that you pull yourself together . Reverend Cameron 's sitting out there in the vestibule , guarding the sanctity of his wife . If he hears you balling like that , I 'm afraid he might bust in here and jump on me . MRS . CAMERON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . KUMAKO Humor is a gift from our ancestors . p. 44 MRS . CAMERON You 're going to make me the demon in your eye sight , are n't you ? KUMAKO I ca n't make you anything . MRS . CAMERON You 've already made up your mind . You 've decided that I am . . I am . . KUMAKO A woman . A fine , intelligent young lady . Does the Reverend know about Jamie and you ? MRS . CAMERON I'ou n't know . I doubt it . KUMAKO Does he even suspect ? Has he given a hint ? It could n't have been an innocent remark ? MRS . CAMERON Not to my knowledge . KUMAKO Have you slipped up ? MRS . CAMERON I ou n't know . I'ou n't know . KUMAKO Better wipe your eyes so they wo n't get too red . MRS . CAMERON My husband , does he have to find out ? KUMAKO He will sooner or late . . The only way we can keep skeletons out of our closet are not to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMERON God , what am I going to do . KUMAKO I hope you get an answer . Downtown will uncover your secret too . p. 45 MRS . CAMERON I was so careful . So certain of myself . Never took a chance . Not one . I took nothing for granted . KUMAKO There 's always one clue that 'll lead the police to your door . So , my advice to you , is that you better prepare yourself for them . They 'll come more vicious with the direct intention of accusing you of murdering Jamie Hathaway . They do n't like for Blacks to try to outsmart them ; to try to get away with a felony . They 'll lock you up sistuh , go home and kiss their children , eat dinner , and sleep like a new born baby . They have already criminalized the whole Black race in the U.S.A. MRS . CAMERON But I did n't kill Jamie ; I could n't . I cared too much for him . He is . . . he was such a loving man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . CAMERON I'ou n't know where to begin . KUMAKO pulling out his notebook , flipping thru it.Well , we know some things already . For instance , we know he was borne in Turnkey , Alabama . College grad . Lieutenant in the service for two years . Did some graduate work at the University of Chicago . Dropped out of grad school . Spend a few years as a D.J . in Gary , Indiana . Came to Pittsburgh about two and half years ago . Got a part-time job at a college radio station . Work as a social worker in a Black adoption agency . Attended the Judgment Day Baptist Church . We 've yet to find any living relatives . p. 46 MRS . CAMERON He has n't none . At least that 's what he told me . That caused a constant argument between us . KUMAKO How 's that ? MRS . CAMERON He wanted a child . A boy . But , of course , so he said , he would settle for a daughter . Jamie , as he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that ? KUMAKO Imagine what ? MRS . CAMERON Me . Pregnant . My husband 's fifty-nine . What would I look like having an outside baby . I love Jamie and I love my husband Whoever said a woman ca n't love two men , well , they certainly never met Jamie Hathaway . Jamie was good to me . Real good . That 's all I wanted from him to be good to me . KUMAKO Is that all you got from him ? MRS . CAMERON Well , I did n't want his baby . I do n't even want my husband 's baby . You can fool some men all the time , But Jamie . . . When Jamie wet his lips , I 'd just melt into a puddle of water . He loved to kiss too . There were a few times he kissed me so long he wore the skin off my lips . KUMAKO Who were some of Jamie 's enemies ? I mean , who did n't like him ? MRS . CAMERON You mean , females ? KUMAKO And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers than he had male friends . I never felt he had any female bed partners , other than me . KUMAKO Pretty sure of yourself . MRS . CAMERON On that , I 'm certain . KUMAKO Why is that ? MRS . CAMERON Because I was good to him , Detective Victorious . What else does a woman have to go on ? KUMAKO Intuition and integrity . MRS . CAMERON I 'm a modern day feminist , Detective . I have a master in Social Work and . . . KUMAKO I 'm aware of your academic life . So you 've kept this relationship away from your husband ? You know , if the Reverend knew about Jamie and you that 's a prime motive for murder . MRS . CAMERON Mikey ' a real minister ; he would harm anyone for no reason whatsoever . KUMAKO The church has a kitchen here right ? MRS . CAMERON Yes . It 's right down there . Why ? KUMAKO I 'd like to see it . And I 'd like to see your kitchen at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( There 's a knock on the door . ) That must be my husband now . p. 48 KUMAKO Pull yourself together . GILBERT entering.The police just arrested the reverend for the murder of Jamie Hathaway . END OF ACT ONE@@ ( Opens in Mrs. VICTORIOUS living room . KUMAKO is eating what 's left of a sandwich . ) KUMAKO Mom , you said Dad would be home , what happen ? MRS . VICTORIOUS There 's been a change in his plans . Your father has to sneak into Tulsa , Oklahoma to do . . . whatever the Society of Liberators says he has to do . KUMAKO Hope it does n't put him in danger . MRS . VICTORIOUS Being Black puts you in danger . KUMAKO I knew you were going to say that . MRS . VICTORIOUS You 're growing  --  slowly but surely . KUMAKO In your eye sight maybe . I guess I 'm still mad at the D. A 's office 's have been working on this Hathaway 's case behind my back . Trying to show me up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsubstantiated evidence in the world . A blind person can see thru . . . MRS . VICTORIOUS They really have you all fired up , as they young folk say these days . KUMAKO Just too many ambitious folks in the D. A. 's office for me . Politics stay on their minds . It 's just too early to drawn conclusions in this case . Too many unknowns . p. 50 MRS . VICTORIOUS You must have some gut feelings ? KUMAKO Someone , in the neighborhood , called in an anonymous tip that they recalled seeing Reverend Cameron going into Hathaway 's apartment building on the day Hathaway was murdered . MRS . VICTORIOUS Circumstantial . Hearsay . Never be allowed in their court of law . KUMAKO Well , they did find Reverend Cameron 's fingerprints in Hathaway 's apartment . So we know he 'd been there . Why ? We can only conjecture at this point . MRS . VICTORIOUS But you know , right ? KUMAKO I ca n't prove it yet . MRS . VICTORIOUS He still might 've done it . KUMAKO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . I 'm not eliminating that possibility at all . But I 'm leaning towards Mabel Fuller right now . MRS . VICTORIOUS Protect yourself , son . KUMAKO I intend to . MRS . VICTORIOUS What kind of person is Mabel Fuller to get your suspicion up on her ? KUMAKO Mrs. Fuller.A divorcee . I think she 's mainly over-protective of her seventeen year old daughter . p. 51 MRS . VICTORIOUS That 's a trait to valorize . KUMAKO I thot you would approve  - -  which is why I phrased it like that . MRS . VICTORIOUS Kumako . What are their connection to the murdered victim ? KUMAKO I found Ms. Fuller 's name and address taped underneath Hathaway " s telephone . MRS . VICTORIOUS That might be incriminating information . KUMAKO The strange thing about it all is it had her daughter 's name on it too . MRS . VICTORIOUS Now your suspicious mind 's really doing flip-flops . KUMAKO Mrs. Fuller said that she and Calloway met every other Monday . I do n't want to dream up too many what-ifs situation sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to know out of their own mouths what their relationship was with this Hathaway character . MRS . VICTORIOUS Especially Mrs. Mabel Fuller ? KUMAKO I did n't say nothing like that , Mama . MRS . VICTORIOUS This case . . . you think you can help anyone of them in the Afrikan way ? KUMAKO I can only do what Dad and you taught me to do . p. 52 MRS . VICTORIOUS Just remember your ancestors . KUMAKO I do , mama . Every morning the sun rises in the eastern horizon I give them their props . That 's something the young folk say today . It means the same thing : honoring your ancestors . Let me get up and make my runs . You know the murder weapon keeps burning in my brains and the unidentified pieces of glass found at the crime scene . I 've checked the Cameron 's kitchen at the Reverend 's office . I have to checked Mrs. Cameron kitchen at home and Mabel Fuller 's kitchen . Yeah . That would satisfy me . MRS . VICTORIOUS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a little thin , son . KUMAKO The ancestors will fatten me up . MRS . VICTORIOUS Some times a little human intervention will help too . KUMAKO Have work to do Mama . Love you to life . MRS . VICTORIOUS Our love is yours too . ( Lights out and come up on Reverend Cameron 's office . GILBERT sits behind the Reverend 's ' desk . ) MRS . CAMERON enteringWhat are you doing ? GILBERT Well , look who has returned to the nest . MRS . CAMERON I said , what are you doing ? p. 53 GILBERT I do n't follow you . MRS . CAMERON I know that seat 's burning your behind . GILBERT Do I look good behind this big old desk or what ? MRS . CAMERON You look a mess . It is inappropriate for a secretary to be . . . you know what I mean . Get up from behind my husband 's desk . ( Makes himself more comfortable ) MRS . CAMERON You 're impossible . GILBERT How 's the reverend showering in the clink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . GILBERT You mean , he looks worst than he does . . . oh , sorry . MRS . CAMERON Gilbert , what am I going to do . My family never had anything to do with the courts . . . jail . . . . . . cousins , maybe . . . but my brothers and sisters . . . straight up sanctified and holy . GILBERT Well , that might 've been the best thing for our people . Anyway , since you asked , the first think , I feel you need to do is get rid of that jack-leg attorney your husband told you to contact . MRS . CAMERON Why ? Samuel Holson 's been our attorney for years now . p. 54 GILBERT Yeah but the Negro is not a criminal lawyer and that 's what the Reverend needs is a Johnny Cochran . MRS . CAMERON A criminal . . . Mikey 's not a criminal . GILBERT Then why was he arrested . . . stealing cookies from the cookie jar ? What 's strange is why would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMERON He did n't . He did n't kill nobody . How could you even think such thing . You know him . You know he would n't harm anyone . He 's a man of God . A good man . GILBERT He killed your man on the side . MRS . CAMERON You do n't know what you 're talking about . GILBERT I know plenty . Plenty . Men 's been killing other men over a fine woman who glows with sensuality . MRS . CAMERON You ca n't reduce me to a piece of leg or . . . . GILBERT Woman , it 's not a reduction , its to the 100th power . You a big ole black stallion . Big-legged momma with a beautiful fiery face . I 'm not trying to be funny , by , say , Rosemary , you like it at a trot or do you like it at a gallop ? MRS . CAMERON I 'm not going to answer your silliness . GILBERT Just a curious thot. p. 55 MRS . CAMERON Like most men , your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never mind . . . GILBERT Ok , ok , forget the nonsense  --  for the moment . What about bail for your old man ? MRS . CAMERON Sammy said there 's no bail for a murder suspect . GILBERT That does n't make sense . Not in the Reverend 's case . Where 's he going to hide . The man could n't hide if he was a shadow in a pitch black room . MRS . CAMERON I think Detective Victorious 's on Mikey 's side . GILBERT What makes you think that ? MRS . CAMERON I just talked to him ; he said the arresting officer probably made a mistake and for me not to worry he would take care of everything in a matter of a few hours . GILBERT Maybe the Afrikan cop 's falling head ova heels for you . MRS . CAMERON Do n't be silly , Gilbert . GILBERT You have pretty lips . MRS . CAMERON Where did that come from ? Do things just drop out of the sky into your head without context ? GILBERT Could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church ; this is your livelihood too . p. 56 MRS . CAMERON Oh , yes . The church . There 's so much work to do . . . . the church . . . what 's going to happen to-to the church ? GILBERT Call the deacons together . MRS . CAMERON Yes . GILBERT What are you going to tell them ? MRS . CAMERON Jesus Christ ! I do n't know the first thing about running a church . GILBERT The Reverend would n't listen to me ; I told him he should have an assistant preacher . MRS . CAMERON Minister . GILBERT Minister . Jack leg . They all the same . Father . Bishop . Pope . MRS . CAMERON Why do you work here . You have no respect for the church . Any church . GILBERT I like the pay . And it allows me to be around you . MRS . CAMERON They 'll get you nothing . I 'm not a check ; you ca n't cash me in at the bank . GILBERT Ai n't it silly but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that 's how you get off , that 's all you 'll get here . GILBERT I 'll wait one year after your ole man 's get the gas chamber . p. 57 MRS . CAMERON You hope . But I 'll never be that hard up . GILBERT Well . I know a lot about running a church . This church , especially . I could get it back on its feet in nothing flat . I could clean up your husband 's conviction and have it erase from the congregation 's mind in a matter of weeks . Sunday 's only two days away . But . . . if I 'm not welcome . . . I 'll just run along and mind my own business . MRS . CAMERON Wait . Gilbert . Wait a minute , Gilbert . Let me think . GILBERT You do n't need my help . You just dissolved our friendship . MRS . CAMERON I take it back . It 's a woman 's prerogative  --  to change her mind . Right ? GILBERT Make this your last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're back on that same train .

I notice you had a knife missing from your cutlery set . GERRI I believe it got lost when we moved from the Hill to here . KUMAKO Sounds like you do n't particular like McKeesport . GERRI It 's all right . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss a lot of things I grew up around . I 'm getting use to it rho . KUMAKO You miss Jamie Hathaway ? ( No response . ) Do n't be afraid . I told you I 'm here to look after what 's best for you . Okay , you do n't have to answer that one . It 's written all over you . Get back to the last time you said you saw him . GERRI thinking , remembering.Sunday , after church , I went to see Jamie . I 'm usually happy and excited when I 'm on my way to his apartment . I did n't noticed anything unusual until I got to the second floor where his apartment was and there was that yellow ribbon tied across the door . I 'd seen enough movies to know what that meant so I turned around and ran out of there as fast as I could . I 'm not really a News person ; I watch it when Mamma has it on but that 's about it . I 'm not into current events unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you found out Jamie was dead , murdered ? GERRI It was strange how that happened . It was Monday evening . When I got home , Momma had fallen asleep on the couch . I was abt to shake her when i saw Jamie 's picture in the newspaper Momma had been reading . I read it . I mean , I felt like I was being suffocated in a coffin along with him . I stared at Momma and I could still see tears on her face . I dropped the newspaper and started for my room . Momma asked me what was wrong . I told her nothing was wrong . Somehow I made it to my room . I did n't ; t sleep for two days in a row . I got home from a meeting of the school newspaper team . KUMAKO You said Monday ; what Monday and how did you remember it was a Monday that you found out about Jamie 's death . GERRI Well , Momma 's usually not home on Monday night . KUMAKO That 's consistent . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , that . I 'm the international editor of the school 's newspaper . . That 's what I like international news . I plan to study ancient Chinese history . KUMAKO That 's good . How are you feeling now ? GERRI Bad . I feel bad . I feel like I want to throw up . p. 62 KUMAKO Can you make it to the bathroom ? GERRI I think I 'll be okay . KUMAKO Can you talk about you and Mr. Hathaway ? GERRI Who ? Oh , Jamie . I 've never called him mister . Maybe I should 've , huh ? KUMAKO I 'm not here to judge you . GERRI Mamma ca n't stand him . He was good to me . They just could n't dance together . I think I 'm a lot like him . Soon as I graduate from high school , no church , no singing in the choir , no kneeling , no praying , no nothing but living life to the fullest like my daddy . KUMAKO Can you tell me about you and Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother are you ? KUMAKO No . This is between us . GERRI Whew ! I 'm glad to hear that . She would flip out if she knew . KUMAKO I 'm not saying your mother does n't know some things about you and Jamie . GERRI You think ? My life 's whacked now . Did you tell her ? KUMAKO No . I would n't do that unless she already knew . Go ahead , abt Jamie and you . Do n't hold back . I 'll get to the truth sooner or later . p. 63 GERRI Well , Jamie and I were . . . you know . . . KUMAKO I was n't here . GERRI We were intimate . KUMAKO That 's good enough . GERRI Go ahead , say it . He was old enough to be my father . KUMAKO You said it for me . GERRI IT 's true . But he was n't my father , so I ca n't see what the fuss is all about . Anyway , Jamie might have been old enough to be my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , he even got high with me . KUMAKO When was the last time you saw him . GERRI Two Sundays ago from the Sunday just passed . I 'd go to his apartment in the afternoon after church . he had this abt him and me after church . KUMAKO Something romantic about it ? GERRI Guess so . Jamie was very romantic and caring . The showed me a lot of attention . And Jesus knows he was a handsome a man for his age . KUMAKO Did your mother know . . . ? GERRI I would n't be alive today if you knew . She would kill me . KUMAKO Mrs. Fuller 's violent ? p. 64 GERRI Violent 's not the word for it . No , that was a figure of speech . You tricked me . I take it back . . . KUMAKO Are you certain your mother did n't know about you thing with Jamie ? GERRI Pretty sure . If she knew , she never said a word to me . KUMAKO Jamie never said a word to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious about you two ? GERRI No , nothing . He never mentioned my mother 's name in my presence . You do n't suspect my mother , do you ? KUMAKO No . You know your mother 's here , do n't you ? GERRI She 's at work . KUMAKO I thot you heard her come in when you were crying . GERRI I did n't hear a thing . I guess i was crying too hard . Where is she ? Is she listening to us ? GERRI I asked her not to . ( Calls out . ) Ms. Fuller . Ms. Fuller , you can come in now . ( Mrs. FULLER enters . ) GERRI Momma . MABEL Why are you crying ? You caused her to cry . KUMAKO Your daughter 's tears are her own . p. 65 GERRI Mamma , I 'm all right . Officer Victorious was telling me about-about Mr .. Hathaway 's death . MABEL My baby knows nothing about this ; she 's innocent as you are . KUMAKO i hate to say this , Ms. Fuller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going between Jamie and your daughter . MABEL I 'm asking you to leave my house right now . KUMAKO I ca n't , Ms. Fuller ; I have my job to do . MABEL You 're not doing your job by bringing tears to my daughter 's eyes . KUMAKO I thot you might 've suspected something . MABEL If I did it was n't her fault ; it was his . It was Jamie 's doings . GERRI Momma , I 'm sorry . MABEL Listen to me , it 's not your fault and you had nothing to do with his murder . Christ , she 's only seventeen . KUMAKO How long have you know about Jamie and your daughter ? MABEL Do we have to discuss this in front of her ? KUMAKO Under the circumstances , ah , what the hell , no , not really . p. 66 MABEL Go upstairs to your room . The Lord will judge you now , not man . GERRI Yes , ma'am . KUMAKO See you , Gerri . Stay strong . GERRI I will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to know what was between Jamie and you ? MABEL I did n't kill him if that 's what you mean . There was a moment , just a moment , when I wanted to . God knows I wanted to . And I believe I would 've if I had slept with him that night if he had n't continue acting like a fool . KUMAKO Would you start from he beginning . MABEL You mean , when and how we met ? KUMAKO No . I mean , when you began to suspect Mr. Hathaway was having a relationship with your daughter and if you could tie in the point you just made abt Jamie ( reading from his notebook ) abt Jamie quote acting a fool end of quote . MABEL I 'll try , because I what to clear my daughter 's name . I ai n't no easy woman , Detective . KUMAKO I believe you . My daughter 's not a slut either . KUMAKO I know that . The air is cleared . p. 67 MABEL Jamie Hathaway was no easy person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light eyes , you melted and almost peed on yourself . Jamie knew how to make a female feel like she was someone special in the world . He made me feel like I carried his peace a mind on my breasts . KUMAKO I think I get the picture . MABEL No , I ca n't paint the real picture of Jamie Hathaway ; you 'd have to be a lonely woman like me and there 's plenty of them in Pittsburgh , Mckeesport too . Too many lost men around here . KUMAKO If the men are lost , you have to go , find them and rescue them , sistuh . MABEL When you get my age , you get tired of looking ; the trip tires you out every night . About a month ago KUMAKO Was this on a Monday ? MABEL Yes . How did you know . I guess that 's why you 're a detective and I 'm a private duty nurse . Well , it was a Monday night . I was in Jamie 's arms . You 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soap and water are good cleansers . My heart is not vengeful against human mistakes in life . . Continue , please . MABEL At first I thot he was talking out of his head or just making a joke of it . He started wondering out loud , so he said , about what it would be like for him to make love to me and my daughter . At first I did n't pay it any mind . But it started to be a regular discussion with him . Then one Monday I had enough of him talking under my daughter 's clothes to me . So I had it out with him about stop talking like that in my presence . He got real indignant about it . First time I 'd ever heard him cuss . Scared me nearly half to death . I was n't to that from him . I thot the Negro 's tongue was made of honey and spice and everything nice . p. 68 KUMAKO I thot that was what little girls were made of . MABEL Yeah , we fooled yall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black women that way . Nothing has changed my mind . MABEL You 're probably the only one who feels that way . Too many two-legged dogs lapping ' at your tail round here . It 's hard for a woman to maintain her dignity and to have hard lips on yours . KUMAKO So you had it out with Jamie . MABEL Yes . The Negro showed his behind on me that night . You know , the many sides of the Black man . I saw both of his sides that night . He started screaming and yelling about what he was doing to my daughter and how he was doing it to her . So he felt that he might as well do us altogether . KUMAKO How did you feel about his suggestion ? MABEL I was furious . I felt dirty . And I felt violated me and my daughter . KUMAKO How did he react to your feelings  --  at that moment ? MABEL He laughed . I can see still hear hear him laughing in my face . That musical laugh of his turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . . Laughing and whetting his soft lips . Funny how hate creeps up your spine and smacks you across your face . And you are no longer in the fantasy world of romance but back in the real world of vulnerability . p. 69 KUMAKO You hated him  --  at that moment . MABEL Yes . KUMAKO He 'd violated your daughter . MABEL I hated him for that . KUMAKO And he disrespected you . MABEL Yes , he did . KUMAKO He ruint your Gerri MABEL My baby girl . KUMAKO How did you feel about him messing with your daughter ? ? MABEL I could deal with him violating me , but violating my Gerri , I could n't take that lying down . KUMAKO You could n't take it . What else could n't you take ? MABEL His laughing in my face . His throwing up in my face what he had done to my daughter . I could n't take it . KUMAKO looking at his watch.So you planned to kill him ? MABEL Yes . GERRI who was o.s. listening burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Do n't say it . MABEL I thot you were in your room . p. 70 GERRI You killed Jamie . Momma , you did n't . You killed Jamie . MABEL I ai n't killed nobody . Yes , I hated him then . And I hated him enough to kill him . I could have killed him . I even wanted to kill him . Now is that what you two wanted to hear . GERRI My own mother , murderer . MABEL Girl , you do n't know what I 'm guilty of . KUMAKO Well , if you 're not guilty , than Reverend Cameron must be the killer . GERRI Reverend Cameron ? MABEL That 's a little too far-fetch . Reverend Cameron is not in this . KUMAKO Up to his neck . His fingerprints were found in Jamie 's apartment . MABEL I know my fingerprints are all over the place . GERRI Mine 's too . KUMAKO And no telling who else . Right now the D. A. 's office has connected Reverend Cameron to Jamie 's death . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess we 're next , huh ? KUMAKO To be charged with murder in the Black community is something that 's hard to live down . Your names will be connected to Jamie 's death in the eyes of some Black folk . It 'll be something hard to live down . p. 71 MABEL Even in death Jamie is messin ' with folk . KUMAKO looking at his watch.There 's more work to be done . I 'm going to have to leave . My advise to you two is you better get yourself together and reestablish some serious sisterhood principles as well as a mother and daughter relationship of strong communication . You two are too close together not to be able to share some things once and awhile about your personal lives . If you do n't , it 's easy for the same man to be in both of your lives at the same time . MABEL That ai n't no lie . GERRI Momma . . . KUMAKO to GERRI.Young lady , you might be built like a woman and your hormones rule your sensuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of womanhood . Not yet . GERRI Yes , sir . MABEL I did n't raise her to sleep . . . KUMAKO Mrs. Fuller , you know better . MABEL What ? KUMAKO to MABEL.I can see that your gender is good . A mother has to always know better . Motherhood must glow from your soul . p. 72 MABEL I just might keep you on house punishment until you get that diploma . KUMAKO You ca n't keep her locked up all day and you ca n't be with her 24-7 ; you need a community of parents to watch our for her when you are not around . MABEL Girl , I 'm going to slap you a new day slap you if you do n't associate with your own equals . folk See what it has cost y me you already . GERRI But , Momma , it was n't all my fault . KUMAKO We are not going to blame each other right . That 's not going to help us solve this murder . You two have strong motives . I 'm looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your life or the life of another human , you can not become an ancestor to be honored and respected . MABEL Detective , I have nothing to hide . KUMAKO When I need you , I 'll call you . MABEL Well , you got my number . GERRI Momma ! MABEL I mean , you got my telephone number . ( TO GERRI ) Go to your room . ( Back to KUMAKO ) You got both of my numbers . You know what I mean , Detective Victorious ? p. 73 KUMAKO No , ma'am . ( LIGHTS OUT . Two days later . Lights up on the Reverend ; s office . GILBERT is seen opening the door , and allowing Mrs. VICTORIOUS , who is in her disguise , to enter the office . ) GILBERT Go right on in and have a seat . MRS . VICTORIOUS Thank you .

Jimmy . . . you said he kept a diary ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Yes , he did , faithfully . Were you friendly with my Jimmy ? GILBERT Friendly ? Hardly knew him . MRS . VICTORIOUS That 's strange . GILBERT Huh ? What ? What 's strange ? Something I said ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Oh no , not you . I always thot Pittsburgh was a smoky city . ( ROSEMARY enters in hurry . Slows up and gathers her composure quickly. ) p. 75 GILBERT Mrs. Cameron . this is Jamie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . about Jamie . . . MRS . CAMERON She 's a phony . MRS . VICTORIOUS Pardon me . MRS . CAMERON Jamie never told me he had any relatives . MRS . VICTORIOUS Oh , so you knew my Jimmy ? GILBERT She says say our boy loved to write . But I guess you two did n't hardly spend much time discussing his writing skills , huh ? MRS . CAMERON Watch your mouth . What else did you tell her , stupid ? GILBERT Who you calling stupid . . . MRS . VICTORIOUS I guess I 'll be on my way . GILBERT One question . MRS . CAMERON TO GILBERTBe careful . GILBERT I am . MRS . CAMERON Do n't let our smart mouth drown you  --  and me .

Young man , what is your point ? GILBERT My point . . my point is this . . . if the police has Jamie 's diary , then they must 've learn the names of Jamie 's closet friends . . . even his bosom ladies . . . ? MRS . VICTORIOUS Oh , no way , I do n't see how that is possible . GILBERT imitating Gary Coleman.What you mean , grand mom Hathaway ? GILBERT What 's not possible ? MRS .

REVEREND CAMERON My lack of attention was totally directed to my ministry . When I found out abt Jamie and you , I could n't keep my mind on my duties . My sermons began to suffer . Yes , by then , Satan had taken complete control of me . I I did n't realize how easy to hate everything about someone like Jamie for what he was doing to me . GILBERT So true , so true . MRS . CAMERON Jesus , forgive me . . . Satan seduced me too . GILBERT Woman , you let your own self be seduced . REVEREND CAMERON Both of you two , shut up ! And i mean , shut the . . . heck . . . up . . .

REVEREND CAMERON The last time time , I went to have it out with him , I would 've if he had been in his apartment . Because by that time , I was walking in the footprints of Satan . I had made up my mind , that evening I went to Hathaway 's apartment , I had made up my mind , my soul would be with Satan for what I planned to do . Luckily , he was n't home .

GILBERT Well , what now ? You got your murderer . I 'm hungry as a bear after hibernation . KUMAKO Yes , you 're right . One of you murdered Hathaway . GILBERT That 's not funny . p. 88 KUMAKO I do n't laugh at everything . Mabel , I 'm sorry to say it , but Gerri too has a motive . Under the circumstances , I think she would do almost anything to keep you from finding out abt Jamie and her . MABEL I do n't believe it . MRS . CAMERON What am I going to do . Mikey 's headed for an emotional breakdown . GILBERT If he does , sister , you 're the cause of it . KUMAKO I 'm not dropping a guilt trip on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of God . He might be a broken man now , but we have ways to mend him . MRS . CAMERON I ca n't carry this burden . I ca n't carry this burden . GILBERT Come again . MRS . CAMERON Mikey 's married to his Lord , his church , his deacons , his ladies of the church , his ministry , not me . I was the symbol , a show thing to prove to the ladies and the men in the church that he would not be lusting after their women . You understand , I was starving for affection . . . tenderness . . . someone to tell me how desirable and attractive I was . . . MABEL I know that need , girlfriend . MRS . CAMERON I was treated like I was a symbol who was just there . . . not as a wife . . . definitely not as a lover . And every woman wants to be a lover and cared for like a lover . Jamie . O that Jamie . So handsome . Pretty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You men do n't know what it means to a woman to be wooed by a younger man whose prettier than you are . Yes , sweet Jamie had all the moves and words to make me . . . p. 89 GILBERT Aw , hush yo mouth , hussy . MRS . CAMERON Jamie laid me out . GILBERT I could 've done that . MRS . CAMERON I resent that . Matter of fact , And I resent you . I resent everything about you . KUMAKO Do n't worry , Mrs. Cameron , my people will help you . Your destiny lies in another direction . My people are very leery about trying to help Blacks who commit violent crimes and who are drug dealers . My mission is to help rescue those who can be healed and transformed . GILBERT What are you talking about ? What people ? What mission ? KUMAKO That can wait . ( Turns to MABEL ) And you , you 're noy all that innocent as you pretend . MABEL I'ou n't know what you 're talking . . . KUMAKO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your daughter ? MABEL No , I did n't kill Jamie . KUMAKO He was sleeping with your daughter . MRS . CAMERON Did she say that . Then she 's a liar . MABEL Who you calling a liar ? p. 90 MRS . CAMERON You the only liar in here I see . MABEL Oh , you was n't lying to Reverend Cameron . Cheating is a new form of prayer these days . MRS . CAMERON You black liar . MABEL You know , if we were n't on holy ground , I would put my shoe heel in your skull . KUMAKO Let 's keep color out this . Put color into the mix and everything will become more irrational than it already is . ( To MABEL ) You have to stop threatening Black folk . MABEL Well , tell her to stopping stepping on my feet . Anyway , for her information , if I may say so , Jamie wanted , no he begged me to sleep with him because he could see I had it going on . You see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand the looks of you . MABEL You do n't hardly fit my taste , sistuh . MRS . CAMERON I 'm not your sistuh either . KUMAKO to MABEL.He was sleeping with your daughter , Gerri , right ? MABEL You know that already . GILBERT Dag , Jamie was a bigger stud than I thot . And a cradle robber too . p. 91 KUMAKO badgering her.That 's why you killed him . MABEL No , I did n't . GILBERT Murderer . KUMAKO You took a butcher 's knife and slit his throat . MABEL I would 've shot him in his face . That would 've fixed him good . MRS . CAMERON Killer 's written all over her . KUMAKO You slept with Jamie Hathaway , did n't you ? MABEL I told you I did n't . Why are you doing this to me ? MRS . CAMERON Jamie did n't do anything with her or her daughter . GILBERT Woman , how do you know that ? KUMAKO to GILBERTYou . I know you killed Jamie , but I still ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to almost decapitate a human being ? GILBERT You have no evidence to connect me with Jamie 's death . KUMAKO Oh , a little blood sampling from you 'll connect you to scene of the crime . Gilbert Calloway , you 're under arrest for the murder of Jamie Hathaway . Anything you say can be used against in a court of law . p. 92 GILBERT Yeah okay , I did it . Put me in handcuffs , officer . MRS . CAMERON Jamie never mentioned Gilbert to me . KUMAKO The Reverend 's wrist watch is the only clue I have that connects you to the crime scene . GILBERT What ? You must be Chris Rock . KUMAKO The forensic experts could n't figure out where the pieces of glass came from until I told them what I suspected . I remembered you said you had to pick up Reverend Cameron 's watch from the repair shop . I have a copy of the original receipt from the shop owner . The same day you killed Jamie , you took the watch back to the repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face must have shattered when Jamie was fighting for his life . GILBERT He was weak . I shoudl have snapped his skinny neck . I would have enjoyed that much better . My wrist somehow got caught in the steering wheel and when I yank it out , the Reverend 's watch broke ; I tried to pcik up the pieces of glass a sbest I could . . KUMAKO That 's when you got your so-called paper cut . A partial print might not convict you but a little DNA-testing will hook you at at the crime scene . Now . You went to pick up the watch from the shop the day I first arrived here to talk with Reverend Cameron . p. 93 MRS . CAMERON The watch was a gift Mikey received from the Bishop . . . GILBERT It was a fabulous watch . My wrist made that watch look like it was worth a million dollars . I fell in love with it on my wrist . KUMAKO Did you have a thing for Jamie ? GILBERT Wrong . I had nothing for Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I had for him was contempt . Contempt . Like he was a maggot . MRS . CAMERON You mean , Gilbert , actually killed Jamie . Why ? GILBERT Because of you . MRS . CAMERON Ridiculous . GILBERT Because you never looked at me . Not once did you notice that I was alive . You were hypnotized by Jamie Hathaway . Not by me . And I-I wanted your tail so bad I 'd lie in my bed , night after night , thinking and dreaming you into my arms . I would do anything , work for free , just to be around you , be near you , to see you , to smell your perfume . There was n't a minute of my life , after metting you , I did n't think abt you . MRS . CAMERON Jesus . GILBERT Not Jesus . You . You . But that sick-oh Jamie Hathaway was getting you . God and I both knew he was no good for you . . p. 94 MRS . CAMERON He was good to me . GILBERT May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We use to get into some dandy arguments over you . I told him to leave you alone or I was going to tell the Reverend . What do I care ? " " Tell the old fool . " That 's how nasty he talked . He care about no body but himself . You thot he cared about you . Ha ! You were just another piece a leg to him . When he was n't jooging you , he was jooging two of the younger girls in the choir . I sort of admired how he could be doing it too all those different females . MRS . CAMERON You liar . GILBERT The man was a remarkable stereotype that leaped out of white racist novels ; he had an insatiable sexual appetite . Jamie Hathaway was a real stud who needed to be on his plantation of women . MRS . CAMERON Liar ? Liar ! MABEL Always calling somebody a liar . MRS . CAMERON Keep your trap out of this . MABEL Do n't let me pull them extensions out of your haid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I was lying . KUMAKO It 's too late to start wishing . GILBERT When Jamie told you he was leaving Pittsburgh , what did you tell him ? p. 95 MRS . CAMERON None of your business . GILBERT I overhead yall . Detective , you did n't know it , but , after they left the hotel in Moon Township , they use to meet frequently in the Executive Club at the airport . You 're not the only Black persons who has an Executive Card . Plus , I know all the hotels and restaurants you two ate in , holding hands like yall were teenagers , smooching and slobbering on each other every chance you got . KUMAKO Mrs. Cameron , tell us about the day of the murder ; what did you do ? . MRS . CAMERON Like Gilbert said , Jamie and I did meet in the club in the airport . We met there quite often . We 'd been arguing a lot the that past week because he was talking about leaving Pittsburgh . . . and leaving me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . . Jamie liked to read American history and the New England states fascinated him . He also like the cold weather . GILBERT See I told you the Negro was strange . MRS . CAMERON Jamie was going to leave me . I could n't have that . . . living without him . . . MABEL Girlfriend , it takes considerable time to adjust to always having your toilet seat down . I do n't wish that on any woman . But you can learn to make a bed with one pillow . p. 96 KUMAKO to GILBERT.How did you happen to be an the airport ? GILBERT I was in the kitchenette , just down the hall here . . . MRS . CAMERON You must 've over heard me ; I was on the telephone in the hallway . GILBERT I was cutting my sandwich in half with a butcher knife when I overheard you speaking . . . no . . . pleading . . . with him not to leave you . . I could hear the tears in your voice . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . . . KUMAKO Is he right ? MRS . CAMERON He was going to leave me and he 'd promise that he would never leave me . That was one of the reasons I allowed myself to submit to his passion . GILBERT Oh , so you had no passion , huh . Women , be for real . Passion 's melted all over you . It 's got to be good passion . Just look at you , momma . MRS . CAMERON not listening to GILBERT.I lied to Jamie with all my might , trying to keep him here , warm next to my bosom . GILBERT Do you have to be so descriptive . MRS . CAMERON I told Jamie I was pregnant with his baby . p. 97 KUMAKO Were you ? MRS . CAMERON Of course not . GILBERT I overheard that . I was furious . For a moment or two , I could n't even stand myself . In a trance , I followed you out of the church . How you were the careful one . Getting in your car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . MRS . CAMERON Your day to commit murder . GILBERT At the airport , I parked in a lot behind you two . You returned first , got in your car and drove out of the parking lot like everything was everything . When he came out and slide in his car , I slide in beside beside him . He was shocked at first , but in a split second he was cool as Ice I demanded that he stopped seeing you ; that he get out of town and never show his black tail in Pittsburgh ever again while I was alive . You know what that Negro did , he laughed . MABEL He could laugh as long as he could kiss . That Negro kissed me so long he kissed the skin off of my lips . MRS . CAMERON Jamie never like to kiss that much . Why would he kiss your lips anyway . MABEL Maybe because I did n't put my lips everywhere . KUMAKO You two cool out . Go on Calloway. p. 98 GILBERT I mean Jamie honestly thot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed . Every pore on my body poured out hate hotter than lava . And when he had the nerve to call you a freak.  --  MRS . CAMERON No he did n't . Jamie would never say that abt me. i do n't believe you . He called you an ole freak . You know the kind Rick James would n't take home to meet momma . I flipped then . Humanity drained out of me and became a puddle at my feet . . MRS . CAMERON You 're lying and the truth 's not in you . GILBERT Woman , I 'm telling you what the fool said and you gon stand there in disbelief . Women . MRS . CAMERON Why should I believe you . . . ? GILBERT He 's dead , ai n't he ? . MRS . CAMERON You murdered Jamie for nothing ; for no sane reason at all . GILBERT For you , I 'll do anything . . . You know that song . ( Singing . ) " Oh , I 'll do anything for your love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anything I have . GILBERT You understand , do n't you , Detective ? KUMAKO Killing human beings , especially Blacks killing Blacks , I will never understnad. p. 99 MRS . CAMERON Me neither . KUMAKO Nor can I forgive you , Mrs. Cameron . MRS . CAMERON I can not forgive myself . GILBERT All I wanted was to adore you . MRS . CAMERON That 's where you went wrong ; you 're only suppose to adore Jesus . GILBERT Woman , you ten times better looking than that white-faced Jesus Reverend Cameron has in his church . if I could have only touched your flesh . . . KUMAKO But neither one of yall have learned how to touch each other 's spirit . That 's what you have to learn before you can be liberated . GILBERT Just a little teeny bitty piece of you and I would 've been satisfied and full up like a whole man . Like the man in the song said , if I went to heaven and found you had went the other way , I 'd come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . MRS . CAMERON You sure have a warped imagination about religion . GILBERT No way , baby . I have the killing lover Jones for you . Every since I saw you , I wanted you . I wanted your lips . I wanted your . . . MRS . CAMERON You should 've found you a woman to comfort your desires . Plenty of them walking the streets on the Hill . God do n't like ugly . p. 100 GILBERT I 'm going leave that one alone . As long as the Reverend was humping on top of you , I was cool about that . I could live with that . After all he was your husband and you was his wife . But that Jamie Hathaway . . . he was a creeper . . . a dawg . I say , good riddance to dirt . KUMAKO You took human life . You prevented a soul from evolving . MRS . CAMERON God will never forgive you . GILBERT Really . You need to drop God from your vocabulary . MRS . CAMERON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . KUMAKO Let 's go , my man . You 'll have plenty of time to talk trash to some inmates . MRS . CAMERON Yes , go . Out of my sight . I can stand to look at you . GILBERT Jamie Hathaway or Reverend Cameron never knew what you needed . MRS . CAMERON And I suppose you know what I  --  GILBERT I know . MRS . CAMERON That 's the trouble with you men , you think with the wrong head . GILBERT I would 've adored you ; I would 've worshipped you , I would 've knelt before you and presented you with holy offerings . p. 101 MRS . CAMERON You should 've been worshiping only out Lord and savior , Jesus Christ . GILBERT I could only worship you . MRS . CAMERON Then you are a fool and a lost soul . You showed no respect for the Lord . GILBERT I was never disrespectful towards you , was I ? MRS . CAMERON So . GILBERT But you rejected me . Woman , I always approached you in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrequited love that never felt the softness and sweetness of your lips . . ( He puts handcuffs on GILBERT . KUMAKO MOVES TO OPEN THE DOOR . ) KUMAKO When will you enslaved Afrikans understand that when the situation becomes problematic , you should go before respected elders . You ca n't solve community disharmony by yourself . MRS . CAMERON I ca n't face my husband . KUMAKO Look him in his eyes and speak from your heart . MRS . CAMERON He 's never been corrupted by human flesh . KUMAKO You should n't have let your body control your morals . The flesh is no more corruptible than the soul . You soul will out last your flesh , tho. p. 102 MRS . CAMERON What-what will the Reverend say ? How will he think of me now ? KUMAKO The same way he 's felt about you the day he married you ; he 's the only man who would have not killed for you . GILBERT I did . And what did I get out of it . I 'm the one who killed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that . No full breasts to cry on . Nothing . Nothing for me . . Rosemary , you 'll never leave my heart . Hell , I did the ultimate for you . MRS . CAMERON That 's where you 're going to  --  to hell . GILBERT I 'll tell Jamie you said hello . After all , hell is low . We know where Jamie is . Detective Victorious , you know what 's regrettable about all this ? KUMAKO Murder 's always regrettable for everyone . GILBERT I regret that it was God 's fault . KUMAKO How 's that ? GILBERT He had no right to make a man that pretty . He had no right . KUMAKO You had no right to harbor so much hate and jealousy for your brother . ( KUMAKO OPENS THE DOOR . ) Reverend , you can come in now . MRS . CAMERON Mikey , can you ever forgive me ? p. 103 REVEREND CAMERON Maybe in time . Almight Father knows I nearly lost my anointing . GILBERT Reverend , maybe , if you can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . REVEREND CAMERON Maybe . . . one day . . . maybe , one day . . . I could do that , Gilbert . ( KUMAKO escorts GILBERT to the door , speaks to officers o.s . ) Officers , this is your man . he 's all yours . Tell the Captain I 'll be down to file a charge of first degree murder . ( KUMAKO reaches his hand for MABEL ) Mabel . ( Mrs. VICTORIOUS enters . ) Mama , what are you still doing here ? ( KUMAKO edges Mrs. VICTORIOUS aside with MABEL beside him . ) Dad 's all right , is n't he ? MRS . VICTORIOUS He 's fine . KUMAKO You 're really not here , I know . MRS .

MABEL You were pretty hard on me in there . KUMAKO You got some of it of your system before some members of the community . MABEL Well , I do feel better . Did you know Gerri and I were innocent all the time ? KUMAKO I did n't know abt your daughter , I felt you from jump street . MABEL You did ? Really ? KUMAKO I could n't come out and say it because you were a suspect . But I was hoping you could feel me in you . MABEL When I look in your eyes , I feel I ca n't hide anything from you . Not that I would have a reason to . KUMAKO I have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . MABEL I 'm a good listener . And you have a lot to explain abt your mother . p. 105 KUMAKO Let 's walk thru the Hill . MABEL You know , for the very first time , coming on the Hill to see you , I never noticed how beautiful the Hill can look . KUMAKO So you like Mutabaruka ? MABEL Yes . How did you know ? KUMAKO I 'm not going to squeal on her . MABEL Big mouth . KUMAKO Anyone who listens to Muta means a lot to me . MABEL I am from the Hill District ; you have to prove what you say to me .
