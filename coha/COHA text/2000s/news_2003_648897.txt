<p> The New England Patriots ' locker room is a serious place , with dark , wooden stalls and dim light more typical of a Gothic church than a 21st-century sports romper room . <p> In the moments before the Patriots ' preseason game on Thursday night against the Giants , the veteran cornerback Tyrone Poole , who was playing in his first game for New England , sat in front of his cubbyhole . He was waiting for Bill Belichick , the Patriots ' fourth-year coach , to walk in and offer him a pat on the shoulder pads and encouragement in his first game with the team . <p> Belichick came in and gave neither . <p> Poole was forced to create his own welcome . <p> " Normally , with the couple of teams I 've been on , the coach walks around and says , ' Good luck , ' and things like that , " Poole , a free agent from the Denver Broncos , said after the game , in which he intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants his players to be  --  serious when we go out there . We 're out there to do a job , even in a preseason game . " <p> To hear the newest Patriots explain it , the main reason they chose New England over other destinations during free agency was Belichick 's lack of frills and his penchant for molding defenses . <p> Recruiting trips to New England were stripped down and bare-bones , less about the weight of the lobster at dinner and more about the way Belichick spoke to them . The result for the Patriots was a free-agent haul that rivaled some of the league 's best . <p> " He told me he wanted me here , " Rodney Harrison , a former San Diego Chargers safety , said of Belichick . " He did n't ask me questions about anything else . He said , ' I like the way you play , I like the way you prepare , ' and that 's all I needed . He does n't really smile , and he does n't really say much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you 're doing all right . " <p> Belichick is rarely seen smiling . When he almost smiled at the end of the Patriots ' 26-6 victory on Thursday , his face quickly returned to its dour glare , as if the notion of a grin had caused an allergic reaction . <p> Even as Belichick 's new players stepped under the lights with force last Thursday , Belichick remained stoic . Harrison had five tackles in one quarter . The rookie defensive lineman Dan Klecko , a fourth-round pick , notched two and a half sacks , and seven tackles . <p> Linebacker Rosevelt Colvin plugged holes and monitored the field like a hawk , swift when rushing the passer , stingy against the run . <p> " I think this is the perfect fit for me , " Colvin , formerly with the Chicago Bears , said of playing for Belichick . " The N.F.L. is a production league . If you can produce , you 're out there ; if you ca n't , they get rid of you . Obviously , he 's been producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Football Conference East , which has four title contenders , the Patriots seem poised to bounce back after missing the playoffs with a 9-7 record last season after a Super Bowl championship the year before . The Patriots finished 31st against the run in 2002 but then nabbed Colvin and Harrison , and spent four of their first five draft picks in April on the defense . <p> While most of the 68,000 fans Thursday were giddy after the game , Belichick gave his team a tepid assessment . " Certainly far from perfection , " he said . He then softened some , admitting that there was evidence of positive results in the game . <p> Lukewarm endorsements are only one part of Belichick , though . Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi said the coach had not been as heavy-handed in training camp as he has in the past . One-a-day practices have been interspersed with two-a-days . Perhaps Belichick is learning to trust his players , understanding that many of them take the game as seriously as he does . <p> " When you have a veteran team , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do as players , " Bruschi said . " He 's comfortable with who he has . " <p> Bruschi let out a laugh . " I think , " he said . <p> They Do Call It ' Camp ' <p> As seasons grow longer  --  and attention spans grow shorter  --  coaches are willing to try almost anything to break the monotony of monthlong training camps . Some schedule team functions away from camp , like field trips or team dinners . Others invent contests  --  for example , relying on a kicker converting a long field goal to give the players time off . <p> Denver Coach Mike Shanahan stumbled upon the idea of extra work . He took the Broncos to Houston for a three practices last week against the Texans leading up to Denver 's preseason opener against the Texans last night . <p> " Usually in the second week of camp it is hard to get guys motivated and it is hard hitting against yourself , " Shanahan told reporters after practice on Thursday . " To come here and get three solid practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shanahan does nothing by accident , and there were several benefits  --  both physical and mental  --  to a trip to Houston . The Texans , though in their second year , play a confusing 3-4 defense , a good practice tool for the Broncos ' new quarterback , Jake Plummer . The city of Houston is the site of Super BowlXXXVIII . <p> A little positive reinforcement for the Broncos ? Shanahan played down the notion that he was trying to create mental images of a return trip to Houston in the postseason . <p> " I think our players are smart enough to know where the Super Bowl is , " Shanahan said . " We just need to take care of business right now . We ca n't talk about things we ca n't control , we just need to get better everyday . " <p> When Plummer signed with the Broncos in the off-season , one of the first topics he mentioned was winning the Super Bowl ( the Broncos ' last playoff victory was in the Super Bowl after the 1998 season ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new team with different expectations and more pressure to win , " Plummer said . " I 'm just excited to get the season going , and Denver is a great place to get started , whether it 's the beginning of your career or the middle of your career . " <p> 49ers ' Garcia Is Struggling <p> Jeff Garcia , the quarterback who directed the San Francisco 49ers ' frenzied comeback against the Giants in a National Football Conference wild-card playoff game last season , is beginning this season with a lower-back injury that the team is closely monitoring . Garcia was scheduled to miss the 49ers ' preseason opener last night in Kansas City after his back tightened up during practice Tuesday . <p> Garcia sustained a bulging disk in his back while working out with a trainer in Los Angeles a week before the start of training camp . <p> The smallish Garcia ( he is listed at 6 feet 1 inch , 195 pounds ) has been durable in three and a half seasons as the 49ers ' starter , but he has also taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is throwing on the run . <p> Dennis Erickson , San Francisco 's first-year coach , said last week that he expected Garcia to return for the team 's second preseason game , against the Oakland Raiders on Thursday , but back injuries are among the most difficult to evaluate . <p> Behind Garcia , the 49ers ' talent at quarterback is thin , even problematic . It includes Tim Rattay , a seventh-round pick from Louisiana Tech in the 2000 draft ; Brandon Doman , a fifth-round selection from Brigham Young in 2002 ; and Ken Dorsey , a seventh-round draft choice out of Miami in April . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
