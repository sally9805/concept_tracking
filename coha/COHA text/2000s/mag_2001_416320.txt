Dazzling clusters and nebulae decorate this celestial duo . // Warm summer months bring with them some of the year 's most appealing nighttime skies . With the Milky Way boasting its richest star fields , many constellations offer observers numerous deep-sky surprises . Sandwiched between Sagittarius and Cygnus along the river of the Milky Way lies Aquila , the Eagle , and its tiny neighbor Scutum , the Shield . Although these two constellations contrast greatly , each offers a wide array of astronomical objects to fill those lazy summer nights . Although Aquila contains few nebulae and clusters and is devoid of Messier objects , this large constellation holds many other celestial treats wellworth searching for . The nearby star Altair , flanked by the bright stars Beta ( B ) and Gamma ( y ) Aquilae , serves as the starting point for navigating through Aquila . From a distance of 17 light-years , it shines with the light of 11 suns . A line drawn from Altair through the 3rd-magnitude stars Lambda ( symbol omitted ) and Delta ( symbol omitted ) Aquilae divides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous band of the Milky Way becomes more and more prominent , while the starry glow dies off abruptly to the southeast where dim galaxies prevail . Aquila 's dividing line points to the diminutive constellation Scutum . Although it is one of the sky 's five smallest constellations , Scutum is home to a bright star cloud and is loaded with interesting telescopic fields , including one of Messier 's finest open clusters , an overlooked globular cluster , and some impressive dark nebulae . Scutum is a difficult constellation to trace ; its brightest star , Alpha ( a ) Aquilae , glows at barely 4th magnitude , and its remaining bright stars are located against a brilliant background , making them hard to spot . // Our midsummer tour begins in Aquila , at the yellow star Gamma Aquilae . Using a low magnification , sweep just over 1deg west of the bright star to land on the structured dark nebula Barnard 143 . A complex of dark patches lies against a star-filled field , the most prominent of which is a narrow bar about 20 ' oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the western end to form a U-shape . To the south in the same field lies Barnard 142 , another dark nebula measuring 3 ' long and one-third as wide , making it more difficult to see . Look to the west of these nebulae to see a faint yet crowded star field . Our tour through Aquila ends with the planetary nebula NGC 6751 , easily found at the apex of an equilateral triangle with Lambda and 12 Aquilae . It shows up as a circular disk 30 " across , with a 13th - magnitude star shining just beyond the eastern edge . The darkness immediately surrounding the 14th-magnitude central star indicates that the planetary is another thick ring . Deep images of NGC 6751 bring out three concentric shells surrounding the central star ; the brightest shell , about 0.5 light-years across , has been dated at 2,700 years old . // M 11 // Deep-Sky Objects in Aquila and Scutum // Mll NGC 6781 // NGC 6712 // After Aquila , a treat awaits in neighboring Scutum  --  M11 ( NGC 6705 ) , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly visible with the naked eye by using Lambda and 12 Aquilae as pointers to the area . English observer William Smyth coined the name " The Wild Duck Cluster , " making note of the cluster 's " wedge " shape . But some modern observers see it as more square in form . Small , sharp refractors reveal M 11 nicely , due to a couple dozen stars that shine brighter than 1I th magnitude . The 6 ' core , packed densely with stars , nearly resembles a globular cluster . Streamers of stars surround this region in all directions . Nearly centered in Ml I is an 8thmagnitude star that stands out among the hundreds of fainter stars . Dark lanes and a prominent dark void only 1 ' west of the center traverse the cluster . The second open cluster identified by Messier in Scutum , M26 ( NGC 6694 ) , proves more difficult to locate than almost any other object in the Messier catalog . A pair of 11 lx80mm binoculars barely brings it into view . Through an average-sized telescope , M26 appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 13th magnitude , occupying a space 7 ' across . Larger scopes bring up the fainter background stars . A little more than 2deg south of Alpha Scuti lies NGC 6649 , a modest open cluster made more impressive by the lack of background stars . Situated 5,200 light-years from the sun against a dark obscuration at the western edge of Scutum , the cluster contains only 40 faint stars in a 6 ' area , but they stand out nicely against the dark backdrop . An often-overlooked globular cluster , NGC 6712 , is next on our tour . Bright enough to be visible in an 11 lx8Omm finderscope as a nonstellar object , NGC 6712 appears to be moderately concentrated with little star resolution in a 6-inch scope at 100x . A 13-inch telescope resolves the cluster fully , presenting it against an exceptionally rich background star field . Although it is placed in the plane of the Milky Way and near its center , it is not one of our galaxy 's disk globular clusters ; in fact , it is plunging through the plane of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the planetary nebula IC 1295 just to the east-southeast of NGC 6712 . With a nebula filter in an 8-inch telescope , the two disparate objects look quite similar . In a 13-inch scope , IC 1295 is a circular disk over 1 ' across with a subtly darker center . Larger apertures bring out the thick ring . Look 6 ' to the southwest of IC 1295 to locate the stellar planetary nebula Kohoutek 4-8 , an apparent star that becomes visible through a nebula filter . Return to M 11 and move the telescope 1/2deg to the southeast to find our final target , Barnard 118 . This dark nebula , visible in low magnifications , appears as a starless lane about 1/2deg long and only 5 ' wide that extends from north to south . The starry backdrop gives the correct impression that the dark nebula is in the foreground . Before departing Scutum , be sure to put in your widest-field eyepiece and just scan the constellation.The Scutum stars are in an inner spiral arm of the galaxy , and appear best in small scopes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite sweeping grounds in the summer sky .

" - from " The Day is Done , " by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ( 1807-1882 ) Sidebar The mythological tales revolving around Aquila , the Eagle , are as varied as the constellations themselves , ranging from stories of war and revenge , to love and romance . Adopted by Zeus as his own , the Eagle was sometimes referred to as the thunderbird , as its main purpose was to carry the thunderbolts of Zeus and retrieve them after they were thrown . Sidebar Extremely loyal to Zeus , the Eagle performed many other duties to help the chief god . When Zeus became taken with young Ganymede , a very handsome boy , the Eagle swooped down to abduct him and take him to Mount Olympus , where he then became the cup-bearer of the gods . Ganymede is honored by the constellation Aquarius , the Water-Carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nighttime sky . Sidebar In addition to performing many good deeds , the Eagle also aided Zeus in carrying out punishments . When Prometheus , an immortal Titan , stole a ray of sunlight and presented it to humans as the gift of fire , Zeus became outraged that a power belonging only to the gods was now available to mortals . So to punish Prometheus , Zeus chained Sidebar him to a rock , and sent the Eagle each day to chew on his liver . Because Prometheus could not die , it continuously grew back , giving him eternal suffering . The Eagle finally met its death when Hercules slew it with a poisoned arrow , in order to free Prometheus from his horrible punishment . In reward for the Eagle 's loyalty , Zeus set his faithful companion among the stars eternally . - Elesa Janke Author Affiliation Tom Polakis is an aerospace engineer living in Tempe , Arizona , whose favorite astronomical pursuits are deep-sky observing and photography . // <p>                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone dies in a dream after a fatal blow , he will be killed at the same moment in the real world . In the same way , if someone falls from a great height and hits the ground in a dream , his heart will stop immediately . How it is that Maryam was still living , then ? There was another woman of roughly her age , with her face and her body , walking beside her . They went into a big house together ... in fact , it was n't just a house -- it was a palace . Maryam remembers now that she could hear her companion 's heartbeats . Something was making them feel afraid . The place was like an endless maze , full of closed rooms and halls that led into each other in a way that reminded her of El Tagi 's palace , and all the disturbing memories that it represented . They went up or down three flights of stairs , moving from one large room to another until they reached their destination , where they found themselves standing on a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall that seemed to be made of red brass , with a table in it surrounded by several gold-colored chairs . </P> Maryam could not look down . She felt that she was standing on a fine wire separating two lofty mountains . Suddenly they started to appear , like ghosts . </P> Strange phantoms , ghosts of everyone she had met in her life , were walking slowly along , their faces wearing dumb expressions . The sudden appearance of these phantoms terrified her unexpectedly . Something about them was different from the real people they represented , making them seem more like evil spirits conspiring against her . The balcony shook and she found herself alone among the phantoms , which quickly started to evaporate , disappearing as if they had never existed , leaving behind them nothing but spots of coagulated blood . </P> The other girl came back again . She looked forcefully into Maryam 's eyes before the word " murder " floated into their minds . It began as if Maryam was witnessing a crime ; as if someone she knew well had killed someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the pain did not last long , as , together with her companion , she busied herself with washing away the blood that was sticking to the floor . For some reason , the girl then stabbed her several times , making Maryam 's blood pour out . Then the girl began to writhe about just like Maryam until she too fell down dead beside her . </P> When Maryam woke up , she was astonished to find herself among the living . She thought that she must have been given another life . She was suffering from a terrible headache , and the visitors of her dream weighed heavily on her mind . She tried to ignore them . She was conscious , perhaps for the first time , of being in the wrong place . She was supposed to be waking up in her bed in the narrow room at the girls ' hostel with the gray paint flaking in several places and pictures torn out of magazines stuck carelessly on the walls with little pieces of sticky tape . Instead , she was now lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handcuffs . Everything around her suggested age : the bed with its raised decorations , the wardrobe with the broken door leaf , and the dressing table with the murky mirror , not to mention the trunk made of sandalwood and decorated with shells , most of them broken . </P> She did n't bother to examine the place closely . What baffled her was that she could n't remember how she had come to be here -- the Abdin flat , as they called it -- which no one had set foot in since Yusif had graduated from the College of Pharmacy and returned to El Tagi 's palace . </P> She shook off her feeling of laziness and stood up to explore her new surroundings . To her great surprise , she found her clothes hanging undisturbed in the wardrobe , as if they had never been anywhere else . Her cosmetics were carefully arranged in rows in the dressing table drawers , and some of her hair was still stuck between the teeth of a brown comb , while her papers were scattered around on the dining room table and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a piece of soap was nestled in the soap holder . </P> She went into the kitchen , where she was surprised to see some leftovers in dishes . In the fridge she found a container of cheese and some slices of luncheon meat , with nine eggs , a bottle of mineral water , and some tomatoes and sweet peppers . The sink was filled to the brim with dirty dishes . </P> Everything about the place suggested she had been living there for a while , though her fragile memory kept telling her that she had gone to bed the previous day in the room with the foul smell that she lived in at the girls ' hostel . She had read a letter that Radwa had left for her in the room , informing her that she had left the place and would not be coming back . She held her head in her right hand and went back to the bedroom . She opened the window and as she was turning around to move away from it , she came face to face with herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating . It was n't her face as she knew it . Something about it had changed -- there was either something new there , or else something had gone . It did n't matter ; it no longer concerned her . </P> She lay down on the bed for she did n't know how long . She was incapable of thinking about anything . Snapshots of her life passed in front of her in a random , disjointed way , without adding up to a complete or coherent picture . There were lots of gaps that she just could n't fill . </P> " I 'm nobody , " said Maryam , but it was n't like the usual scene in a bad detective story , when the wicked villain shouts : " Nobody will defeat me , " and the hero replies with confident scorn : " I am nobody . " </P> Unlike those people , who propped themselves up with a quite outrageous conviction , Maryam felt that she had been reduced to nothingness . She no longer had any physical existence to fill a space in the void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world like someone experiencing life for the first time . She grabbed her handbag from the bedside table and tipped out its contents onto the bed . Her hand trembled as she went through what was in it : some small pieces of paper folded up carelessly , an identity card with a picture of herself on it , smiling doltishly with her new features , Radwa 's letter , and some photographs with yellowing edges . She got dressed and went out quickly . In the street , the wind was so strong that she felt it penetrating her pores , forcing her backward against her will . She walked with difficulty along the streets in the city center , defying the particles in the heavy air , trying to ignore the sights and faces that came into her mind like ghosts only to disappear immediately . Eventually , she found herself walking slowly along Suq el Tawfiqiya Street . She ignored the harsh , clashing voices as she stared at a point in space in front of her eyes . There was a man splashing water in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flies off his fruit , and the sound of a radio could be clearly heard from a neighboring caf . As she pushed her way with difficulty through the crowd , she imagined that she was walking in a movie , or in some other existence . She wanted to touch the fruit seller 's peaches and mangoes to convince herself that things were real . Why was she being pursued by this deadly sensation that she was floating on top of the world without living in it , and that the world itself only existed in her imagination ? </P> The weather was extremely hot . She lifted her hair clear off her neck , which was damp with warm sweat . As she sat in an out-of-the-way corner of the caf on Alfy Street , she hoped that she would n't have to wait for Yahya for long . She was wakened from her musings by the sound of an offensive word from the mouth of one of a group of youths sitting around a neighboring table . She fiddled with the silver ring on her finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to compete to see who could make the rudest comments . Maryam looked at her watch and found that it was five in the afternoon . Her appointment with Yahya had been at four . She left quietly . When she tried to ring him later , she was answered by the metallic voice of the telephone operator : " This number is not in service . Please check the correct number and try again . " She tried to phone more than once , but she always got the same reply . She decided to visit him at his workplace . </P> The office was almost empty . There were only two people in it , bent over their work . They were people that Maryam had never seen before , even though she had been coming to the place for a very long time . She cleared her throat audibly , and one of them looked up at her . </P> " Excuse me , is Mister Yahya here ? " </P> " Yahya who ? " </P> " Yahya el Gindi . " </P> " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know him well . He works here . " </P> " There 's no one here with that name . " </P> He said it sharply , even a little angrily , and bent over his papers again . She was forced to leave without understanding what lay behind the aggressiveness of the man 's reply . When she got back to the apartment , she turned everything in it upside down until she found the copies she was keeping of the newspaper that Yahya worked on . She leafed through them like a maniac , looking for his name or some articles by him . Some issues went back three years . She went through every word in them without success . She strewed the copies around her and left them lying on the floor . She burst into a stream of bitter tears punctuated by stifled screams until she fell into a deep sleep . </P> She woke up in the afternoon of the following day , determined to reach Radwa . She picked up her jeans and put them on quickly , with a white T-shirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hair was disheveled , and her face looked ugly and pale without any makeup . She slung her canvas bag over her shoulder and went out running . </P> When she left the taxi that had brought her to the hostel , her heart was leaping in her chest with anxiety . She opened the metal door to the building , and bounded up the staircase , which was almost dark . She could n't find the switch for the staircase light until she reached the second floor . She stood in front of the warden 's door and pressed the bell . She expected to be confronted by the old woman 's childlike face , but no one opened the door . She pressed the bell several times , then continued climbing up . She took out her keys and unlocked the door , which opened in front of her . She found herself facing the hallway exactly as she had imagined it . There was nothing in it except for a worn-out refrigerator , probably dating back to the sixties , the noise of whose motor drowned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they had turned dark gray with the passage of time . Pretending to be calm , Maryam undid the lock to her room . She had often looked at the lock as a mere message from Radwa -- if the lock was there , it meant that Radwa was not there , and if the lock was gone , then Radwa would be inside . Now , Radwa had evaporated from the space within the room and there was no longer any evidence of her . Maryam examined the place carefully , but could n't see any of either her or Radwa 's things . There were some strange pictures stuck to the walls , and everything was in total chaos , with the remains of some milky tea in two glasses on the floor of the room . Before Maryam went out , abandoning herself to the state of total paralysis that : had taken hold of her mind , she noticed a sentence written in colored chalk and shaky English letters at the top of the Wall opposite --  " Dead man walking , dead man talking . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her own handwriting , with the chalk that she always used to write graffiti on the walls . Maryam recalled that only two days ago , she had waked at five in the morning to the sound of shrill shouts , in which she could make out Radwa 's voice arguing with the warden . She had n't come back by the time Maryam went to bed , so Maryam had thought that she would be away for several days as she usually was . The shouting gradually started to turn into definite words , with insults and curses jumping from one topic to another . The words became even clearer when they left the landing and went into the empty hallway . Maryam pretended to be asleep . She was shocked by the vulgar expressions flying like bullets from Radwa 's mouth . </P> " Stop it . I ca n't take it any more ! You 've driven me crazy with this grubby flat of yours . I 'm not staying here any more ! " Radwa shouted . </P> " You should thank God that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is this my reward for not exposing you ? " </P> This last sentence struck Maryam like a thunderbolt , especially when the woman 's voice got even louder and she started reeling off the details of Radwa 's relationships with other people precise details that Maryam had known nothing about and had n't even imagined , despite her own supposedly deep relationship with Radwa . </P> This was the same Radwa who as a young girl used to set the dial on the radio to Voice of America , listening to a lot of chatter that gave Maryam a headache , and dancing noisily to the rhythms of hard rock tunes . Suddenly she would listen intently , and almost stop breathing when his voice flowed over the ether waves . She would prick UP her ears to catch each fluctuation of sound , searching for the words that concerned her . But she never reached them . The voice would change into a public voice aimed at thousands of listeners who followed it over the shortwaves as the man read out the names of friends of the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere letters uttered into the void , and cracked jokes he thought amusing . Radwa would switch off the radio angrily , walk back and forth between the two beds , then switch it on again , just to listen to the voice of her father who worked for the Voice of America and sent her money at the start of each month , and a postcard with " Kisses to my little Radwa " and nothing else written on it . </P> Now Maryam started to imitate Radwa . She would not turn the dial on the radio away from Voice of America as she waited for tile man 's voice . She was desperate for him to supply her with any news about his daughter . As usual , though , it was just a general voice with no depth to speak of , ramming home his boorish commentary and leaving Maryam on the verge of madness . </P> First published in Arabic as Matahat Maryam , " Maryam 's Maze " appears courtesy of the American University in Cairo Press . </P>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
