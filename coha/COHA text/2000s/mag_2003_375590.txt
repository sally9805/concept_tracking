One of the hottest accessories around is the " jelly kelly , " a rubber , cartoon-colored version of Hermes ' famous Kelly bag . Finding Nemo is easier than finding this bag : it sold out in two days at Steven Stolman in Southampton , N.Y . The tongue-in-chic bags ( $60 to $145 ) are made by Chiarini , a small firm in Florence , Italy . Says Stolman : " It 's a great concept to do the world 's most expensive handbag in the world 's cheapest material . "  --  By Kate Betts
