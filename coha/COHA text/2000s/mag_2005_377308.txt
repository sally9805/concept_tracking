How did Howard Dean , whose presidential campaign got derailed by endless replays of a barbaric yawp , go from public laughingstock to party leader ? The new Democratic National Committee ( D.N.C. ) chairman started off with several advantages , including a loyal base that wrote a gazillion letters on his behalf and a lack of serious competition from other prominent Dems . Some Democratic Governors sought an anybody-but-Dean candidate , but neither former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey nor Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm could be persuaded to run . Likewise , Iowa 's Tom Vilsack decided that being Governor and D.N.C. chairman at the same time would complicate his political career , and he never entered the race . <P> Each of the few who did make a run for it was hamstrung in some way , such as former Texas Representative Martin Frost , still hurting from a bitter power struggle with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi , and former Indiana Representative Tim Roemer , a pro-lifer who voted for George W. Bush 's tax cuts and against Bill Clinton 's 1993 economic plan . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with key players and repeatedly calling others for their votes . He reminded people of his far-from-liberal record as a Vermont Governor who received N.R.A . endorsements . Perhaps most important , he assured everyone he would n't run for President in 2008.  --  By Perry Bacon Jr .
