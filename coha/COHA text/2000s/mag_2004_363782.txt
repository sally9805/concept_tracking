Usually , when scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan appeared on Pakistan 's state TV , it was to receive another gold medal for building the country 's nuclear bomb . But last week Khan , a hero to Pakistanis and many others in the Islamic world , came on the air , ashen and visibly shaken , to confess that he had sold Pakistan 's nuclear secrets to Libya , Iran and North Korea . He begged for President Pervez Musharraf 's pardon  --  and , to the chagrin of many Western intelligence agencies that regard Khan as the world 's most dangerous nuclear proliferator , it was granted the next day . " He has made mistakes , but he is our hero , " said Musharraf . <P> The evidence against Khan was undeniable . A U.S. undercover agent had penetrated the hub of Khan 's operations in Dubai and begun to map out an intricate smuggling web that stretched into Sri Lanka , Singapore , Malaysia as well as Istanbul , Turkey ; Casablanca , Morocco ; and several cities in Germany and Central Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So why was Khan pardoned ? Government officials say Khan won clemency in return for full cooperation in the investigation of his network . But diplomats and Khan 's friends claim he had threatened to name several top military officers close to Musharraf who also allegedly profited from the clandestine sales of nuclear technology . Khan 's relatives leaked word to local newspapers that at least two former army generals were aware that Pakistan 's secrets were being passed to other nations . But Musharraf cleared both generals of any culpability for Khan 's smuggling ring . And he made it clear the case is closed ; there will be no further investigation of links between the military and Khan 's nuclear profiteers . <P>  --  By Tim McGirk , Syed Talat Hussain and Ghulam Hasnain
