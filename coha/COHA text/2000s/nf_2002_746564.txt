Section : LAW PRACTICE MANAGEMENT Enron Litigation Could Test the Effectiveness of Limited Liability Partnerships . The Structure Is Designed to Protect Partners From Personal Liability for the Negligence of Others . <p> THE COLLAPSE OF ENRON MIGHT give partners at law firms reason to ponder another epic disaster : the sinking of the Titanic . <p> Enron 's rapid slide into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history dramatically illustrates the need to protect against the possibility that one catastrophe involving a client might sink a professional partnership . It could happen at Arthur Andersen , which was sailing along with the good ship Enron when it struck the iceberg . <p> Shortly after Enron started to go down , the Big Five accounting firm was beset with legal troubles stemming from allegations that its audits of Enron failed to disclose the company 's shaky financial condition . A federal prosecution of Andersen on criminal charges of obstructing justice ended with a conviction in June . The firm is also a defendant with Enron and others in lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Houston by shareholders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse , Andersen has lost clients , partners and employees in droves . At deadline for this story , the firm had n't taken the ultimate step that could lead to its demise  --  filing for bankruptcy  --  but experts say it 's a possibility . And though the eventual outcome for Arthur Andersen is far from certain , the possibilities are causing nervousness in the accounting world and beyond . <p> " A case like Enron shows you can bring down an accounting firm that is significantly larger , in terms of employees and revenues , than any law firm in the country , " says David M. Neff , a bankruptcy partner at Piper Rudnick in Chicago . " Lawyers are feeling , ' There , but for the grace of God , go I. ' Who could ever foresee Arthur Andersen being in a situation like this ? <p> " And then , you would think , " says Neff , " ' If an accounting firm of that high status could be in a situation like this , why not my own law firm , someday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A FIRM 'S FIRST PRIORITY should be to take steps to steer clear of these danger zones in the first place . But if that fails , lifeboats exist for firm members to avoid sinking under the weight of catastrophic liability . The primary vehicle is a limited liability partnership , designed to protect the personal assets of individual partners by preventing them from being held vicariously liable as individuals for claims against other partners and the firm . <p> Some question whether limited liability partnerships , also known as LLPs , have holes of their own . The legal validity of this organizational structure has never been seriously challenged , experts say , but if Andersen goes bankrupt , creditors are likely to contest whether its partners should be protected by the firm 's LLP structure . <p> " I think the first few decisions in this area are going to be very important , " says professor Robert W. Hillman of the University of California at Davis School of Law . " This is the ball game . " <p> In addition to Arthur Andersen , other co-defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provided advice to the energy company . One of the firms , Houston-based Vinson &; Elkins , is organized as an LLP under Texas law , while the other , Chicago 's Kirkland &; Ellis , remains a general partnership . However , the allegations are far from proven , and there are no indications the firms will face the worst-case outcome that could produce a graphic demonstration of the advantages of an LLP organizational structure . <p> A little over a decade ago , virtually no one would have thought that a single disastrous representation might destroy a professional firm . Then came the savings and loan crisis . <p> Problems ranging from mismanagement to outright fraud resulted in a wave of S &L; failures beginning in the 1980s . Regulators sorting out the mess eventually arrived on the doorsteps of law firms and accounting firms that had advised S &Ls,; seeking to hold them accountable for some of the losses . <p> Until then , " In the ordinary course of events , you would n't expect to see a large professional firm run out of assets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Illinois College of Law in Champaign . But when the S &L; crisis hit , " The professional firms could see the real specter of liability large enough to extinguish the assets of the firm , " he says . <p> Lawyers and accountants soon were lobbying state legislatures to enact statutes allowing professional firms for the first time to form limited liability partnerships . <p> The purpose of these new LLP laws was to prevent individual members of a firm from being held personally liable for the negligence of other partners . Although a firm could still be destroyed by a few lawyers ' errors that resulted in overwhelming damages , only those responsible for the mistakes would potentially have to pay with their personal assets . The liability of other partners would be limited to the amount of their capital contributions to the firm and the amount of any personal loan guarantees they might have executed for the firm . <p> In 1991 , Texas became the first state to allow professional firms to organize as limited liability partnerships . Today , they are permitted , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdout is Illinois . Law firms there are barred from organizing as LLPs under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 721 . That could change if the court approves an amendment granting an exception to law firms that carry malpractice insurance . Other professional partnerships in the state already are allowed to form as LLPs . John B. Truskowski , a tax lawyer at Chicago 's Lord Bissell &; Brook , predicts the LLP alternative will be popular among Illinois law firms if it is permitted . <p> Elsewhere , the LLP structure has been adopted by many law firms as well as other professional partnerships . Among the larger U.S. law firms , " A big majority , maybe 60 percent or 70 percent , are LLPs rather than ordinary partnerships , " estimates Alan R. Bromberg , of Southern Methodist University 's Dedman School of Law in Dallas . He drafted the LLP statute that was enacted in Texas . <p> While the benefits of an LLP structure are most apparent for partners at large law firms , Ribstein recommends that firms of all sizes consider them . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . Even though it 's more likely that partners at a small firm will be involved in a colleague 's mistakes , they have nothing to lose by protecting themselves from catastrophic liability with an LLP , Ribstein says . <p> LLPs are favored over other organizational structures intended to protect the personal assets of firm members , experts say . Two approaches have been to organize the firm as a professional corporation or a limited liability corporation , making firm members shareholders . These approaches have not been as popular a choice for law firms , however , which can face tax liability when converting to a law firm corporation , says Truskowski . <p> The protections of limited liability partnerships are n't intended to apply every time a professional firm runs into financial difficulties . It would be unusual for damages from a claim against a law firm to exceed available insurance coverage , let alone firm assets , says Neff . " Not unless it was huge , " he says . " Plenty of law firms have been sued and settled judgments against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale . " <p> The protections that LLPs offer to individual partners would kick in when a firm declares bankruptcy . But law firms , buoyed by a healthy economy and their own efforts to follow more effective business practices , have encountered few major financial problems in recent years . While a few firms declared bankruptcy following the economic downturn of the late 1980s and early ' 90s , the last significant bankruptcy by a law firm was Chicago 's Keck , Mahin &; Cate in 1997 . <p> As a result , there have been few opportunities for courts to consider the validity of limited liability partnerships for professional firms . TEST CASE IN WAITING <p> IN THE WAKE OF ANDERSEN 'S PROBLEMS , THE COURTS could get a chance to consider the LLP structure if civil claims against the accounting firm force it to join its former client Enron in bankruptcy . <p> Legal academics say they expect limited liability partnerships for professionals to be upheld against court challenges  --  at least for accounting firms , where the first court test of LLPs is likely to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to law firm LLPs . <p> The LLP statutes that were duly enacted by state legislatures will likely be upheld for accounting firms , says Hillman . " Law firms are a little dicier , though . " <p> The reason , says Hillman , is that courts have a special duty to regulate the legal profession that does not carry over to the accounting profession . Acting on that duty , he suggests , state supreme courts might invalidate law firm LLPs if they conclude that LLPs are professionally inappropriate for lawyers . That was the basis for the Illinois Supreme Court decision to prohibit law firms in the state to organize as LLPs . <p> " It 's called the inherent power doctrine , " says Hillman , " which means the inherent power to regulate lawyers and the legal profession . A few courts use this inherent power just to basically ignore legislation that attempts to protect lawyers from liability . The bottom line is that we may be on a dual track in some states , where the LLP track will work for everybody other than lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predicts that courts will eventually uphold well-drafted LLP statutes for law firms as well as accounting firms . <p> " My guess is that the LLP laws will prevail , " says Bromberg , " after which everybody who has n't already jumped into an LLP will jump in that direction . There are still some people who are hesitating , because it 's a little new . But if they see it really works , that Lawyer X is free of liability when Lawyer Y signed the opinion in an Enron kind of situation and is held liable for $100 million , that is going to reassure a lot of people . " <p> Some bankruptcy courts have devised another way to protect partners when firms do n't or ca n't organize as LLPs . They use creditor releases and injunctive relief to prevent future creditor claims against partners who have settled their share of the firm 's debt . Absent this mechanism , settling partners might have to declare personal bankruptcy to protect their personal assets . <p> This method was used in the 1997 bankruptcy of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from creditor claims . The court gave partners an incentive to settle by promising them that making an agreed payment from personal assets would conclude their personal liability for any debts of the firm . The court issued injunctions prohibiting any further creditor claims against the partners . Amounts paid by the partners ranged from $5,000 to $80,000 each , according to Neff . <p> Because most professional firm dissolutions do not result in bankruptcy filings , Neff says , court cases testing the validity of such releases and injunctions have been few and far between . <p> But the best protection , experts say , comes with prevention . To avoid being dragged down when a client sinks , managing partners and administrators must be on the lookout for the internal issues that could create financial chaos at their firms . <p> The Keck bankruptcy , for instance , " was an amalgam of almost every factor that could negatively impact a law firm , " says Neff . " You had a large judgment . You had other malpractice exposure . You had top partners who could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had massive partner defections , ... an expensive lease and expensive furnishings . You had lending institutions that were unwilling to work with the firm to make it continue as a viable enterprise . You had obligations to former partners for loans to the firm . " MANAGE TO PREVENT DISASTER <p> AMONG THE PREVENTION ISSUES TO CONSIDER , EXPERTS say , are the need for appropriate insurance coverage , careful management emphasizing compliance with practice standards and ethics rules , and a firm organizational structure that minimizes the personal liability of partners . Individual partners should think about personal asset protection planning . <p> One critical factor , though , far outweighs the others , according to Hillman . <p> " Step one : No matter how big the firm is , you should be very interested in the quality of management , " he says . " Ultimately , this is a question of management and monitoring procedures that are in place . Do n't just try to protect yourself behind an insurance policy or a **29;1531;TOOLONG form of organization . Good management is everything . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions they raise is whether shielding individual partners from the firm 's liability bolsters or undercuts efforts to manage the firm effectively and responsibly . <p> Ribstein of the University of Illinois maintains that holding partners personally liable for the wrongdoing of colleagues serves little useful function and hurts clients by discouraging the growth of large firms . <p> " When you 're talking about very large organizations , it just becomes completely unrealistic to think that every partner in the firm can have a meaningful role in reducing the risk level , " he says . <p> But Hillman disagrees . He says no one is in a better position to watch over the activities of a law firm than its own partners , who know they will be held personally liable if they fail to do so . <p> " I think partners should be held to a high standard , where there is joint responsibility for the wrongs of the firm , " says Hillman . " It makes a lot of sense . If that means your assets are at risk , then maybe you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with . I do n't think that limiting liability for professional firms is a particularly good idea . " <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> By Martha Neil <p>
