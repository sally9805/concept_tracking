This soap , set within a video-game empire , aims to remake the genre for young ' uns by borrowing from the telenovela ( telling one story , a murder whodunit , over 65 episodes ) and Kevin Williamson 's Scream ( loading up on winking meta-references ) . The story moves a touch faster than most network soaps , and there are a few laughs  --  some of them intentional  --  but MTV could have gone further . NBC 's soapernatural Passions is more innovative than Spyder Games ' familiar sex-and-business setup ; and the cheap production values are strictly daytime . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
