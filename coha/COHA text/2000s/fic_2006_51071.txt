There was a storm- <p> Nearly seven years ago- <p> Julia and Lucas , living in California , they did n't live together . She lived in her space , he in his . Lucas was finishing a degree at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music , biding time ; they were going to move to L.A. soon and get a place together . She was putting on the finishing touches to her dissertation on Malory 's women : Igrayne , Morgan le Fay , Isolde , and Guinevere . The Lady of the Lake . <p> Le Morte Darthur is the story of two great love triangles , a round table , a holy grail . Lots of questing , lots of men dressed up with long sticks on horseback playing chase . <p> That 's just a detail , like this : There was a storm . <p> Lucas 's father , the great teacher , was dying . <p> She was in love with Lucas , and Lucas was in love with her . She was twenty-seven years old : old enough to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . <p> Lucas had flown out to Connecticut to be with his father . To say goodbye , properly : a good son . <p> But he had summer gigs to play , too . Syracuse , Portland , Pittsfield and Amherst and Hartford . <p> He called her from Buffalo . His father had died . He 'd been in Buffalo when his father died , he said , bitterly . The funeral was set . Would she come out ? <p> Of course . <p> The details remain fuzzy for Julia . The past , the way it 's possible for it to slip into a dream . The slip-dream , she calls it . She remembers booking the flight , first class on account of the lastminuteness of the trip ; she 'd never flown first-class in all her life . Across the Continental Divide . Beside her sat a man wearing a hundred-thousand-dollar watch . On the flight he explained English had always been his worst subject . <p> Over Hartford they circled for several hours on account of atmospheric conditions . A mighty storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped up all along the East Coast . Boats along the Atlantic seaboard were going down to the ocean floor like stones . She did n't know this yet , but Lucas had been sideswiped on Route 7-his car in a ditch , his head concussed , fragments of glass in his eye . He had been taken by strangers in the rain to a hospital . <p> Accidents , they were in the air , like lightning- <p> Finally she located a car , a gold-lame Japanese model with a good radio . She had no idea where she was and became lost in Torrington . In Goshen , at the turnaround , she went the wrong direction for three dozen miles . She drove through a town called Sharon . Then , at last in the right place , she located the White Hart Inn . <p> There was a picture of a white hart . Stag , she thought . It was dark , it was thundering . The sky was an ocean mixed up by the hands of the gods . Topsy-turvy , all awhirl- <p> Lucas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lucas , he was always late . Part of his charm . <p> At ten , a message arrived , saying Lucas would not arrive for another two days- <p> She did not know he was in a hospital getting stitches and a CAT scan . <p> The pulling of the drapes . A flashlight in his eye : Can you see this ? And this ? <p> She checked into her room . Possibly this was to be the most expensive hotel she would ever sleep in . The hotel , it had , what , ten rooms ? Eight ? The quilt on the bed was made of goose feathers ; there was a vase of fresh lilies on an antique vanity . Standing at the window , listening to the storm , she felt lonely and cold . <p> Lucas and she , possibly they were going to live together for the rest of their lives . <p> There 's no explaining some things . There 's no use putting too fine a point on things . The finer the point , the less you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum , like a bad girl . She licked her lips . <p> A man-a tall , handsome man-sat alone at a table reading Robert Fagles 's translation of The Odyssey . <p> How many people do you meet up with in the middle of a storm reading a book like that ? A book you know and love ? <p> How often has that ever happened to anyone ? <p> The white clothbound volume , it lay open before him like a bible . By the look of it , Odysseus had been recently washed up naked before the white-armed princess , Nausicaa . <p> Some things make foreplay obsolete . A cold night , the sky electrocuting itself . Putting on a show just for you , willing you to offer it applause . A handsome man setting aside his book to talk with you in the candlelight . They had a drink . The man , he had blue eyes ; he was missing most of a thumb-a good sign , a man who 'd been wounded . <p> Not a mortal wound ; not a crippling wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a while to make up her mind . The White Hart Inn , she thought . At least she was thoughtful . And having thought about it , she explained she did n't want to know anything about him . She especially did not want to know his name . <p> You read Homer , she said to the man . <p> Yes . <p> You have a wedding ring . <p> Yes . <p> Me , too , she said . <p> Really ? <p> Yes , she said , meaning to give him permission . <p> That night she tied up with this stranger like a knot . She thought about Hephaestus , the cuckold , spying on Ares and Aphrodite . How do the gods select ? Then she stopped thinking altogether , and the condom , that bit of artifice , broke . <p> Hephaestus the Lame , the limping blacksmith , laid a trap of iron chains across his bed to catch his wife , Aphrodite , and their cousin , Ares . <p> Love , War- Naked , looking at the gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell flagrante delicto . Imagine watching Love and War maneuver across the feathered pillows . Imagine the crushing of your heart while you watch . Does she spit or does she swallow ? Imagine , too , not being turned on , watching that- <p> Impossible to describe , the things which fill the sail- <p> Owww , wailed Hephaestus , the Crippled Smithy , after the fact . Pointing at his naked wife , and heart . Look at what they 've done to me ! <p> Hee hee , laughed the gods , pointing at Ares and Aphrodite . <p> Hoo hoo hoo . <p> Oh God , just look , will ya ? <p> Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . <p> Stop it ! I ca n't breathe . Stop it . I meant it ! <p> Hee hee , oh . God . <p> Boy yo boy , I got ta pee <p> Which is to say : <p> She 'd never done that before . Fucked a stranger . The easy pick-up ? <p> People said they did things like that when they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that when they did . People said all manner of things after a violent storm amid the tangling of the drapes . <p> It was uncharted terrain for her . When she woke , she never felt so bad in all her life . She left the man 's bed , and then his room , without a word . Not even a note . Certainly not a kiss goodbye . She left , she felt as if a hand had reached inside her body and pulled her stomach out in order to feed it to the fish . <p> She waited the day trembling by the phone for Lucas to call , which he did not do . <p> She told herself , A last fling thing . Like a bachelor party . No big deal . <p> She was not a good liar . She did not know how to do it . She could say to a traffic cop-Oh , gee , was I speeding ? Like Lucas , it was impossible for her to lie . She always had the impression of being read by others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the rules they 'd made : never lie . <p> Never , never lie . <p> So if he asked her , she would tell him <p> But what would he ask her ? What could he possibly want to know ? <p> Are you safe ? Are you fine ? By the way , you have n't had lately any random and meaningless sex , have you ? <p> No . He would n't ask . It was the kind of thing Lucas would never press : never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to . And he had no reason to ask . No reason to suspect- <p> What ? Suspect ? She was a criminal ? <p> She 'd gotten laid , she told herself . Let it go . <p> Innocent until proven guilty , she told herself , which made her weep into a pillow . Only criminals said things like that . Only axe murderers and other really bad people wrapped themselves up in legal hieroglyphics . <p> Just how is it possible to have sex ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I had sex . I had a farm in Africa . <p> Lucas the Boy would apologize first for , like , not showing up . Then he 'd say , Thank you for coming . My father died . Lucas , being a musician , he did n't tell stories . He played them . <p> Of all the times , she told herself . Of all the possible times to go on an oxytocin binge- <p> Dopamine ? She always got the two confused . She would have to be strong . And silent , like a dope . <p> Because Lucas , this man she loved , he would say , crying , his head to her breast , My father died , and she would say , holding him to her body , stroking his hair , I know , I know . <p> There , she would say . There . <p> He would want to make love to her . Is n't that what happened ? In the face of death , did n't people want only to fuck ? To assert that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to have an orgasm ? A sudden exhalation of their life 's breath ? Did n't they want a reason to cry out ? <p> Hoooo eee . <p> Ohhhh . <p> Ah . <p> At the funeral , in the chapel at the prep school where Lucas and Henry 's father had taught Greek mythology for forty days and nights , Julia realized the super-sizing of her mistake . <p> At the dinner , afterward-the man with the shortened thumb . <p> Talk about a symbol . Talk about a warning ! <p> At the bar , in the White Hart Inn , where she drank rum all over again and licked her lips , listening to the brothers reminisce . They were closer back then , she not yet having officially tripped like an idiot between them . The men , they laughed over old stories . Having been raised in the East , the brothers had eagerly fled it for the West-elbowroom , a conspicuous lack of sailor outfits and self-important tennis rackets . Reunited , they ate roast beast sandwiches at the White Hart Inn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood ran red , like wine . <p> Not blue , Lucas said , nodding . Uh-huh . <p> Like a Spartan , a grunt on the hills of Thermopylae , Lucas had a patch over his eye . Henry , she knew , had been horrified . He 'd had no idea Lucas 's mate was traveling east for the ceremony . Penelope , Henry 's wife , she was traveling in the Far East . A textile weaver , no less , who raised her own llamas . She was , having been named Penelope , known throughout the world for her tapestries . She 'd been gone for months . <p> Henry said to Lucas , She 's someplace without a phone . She does n't even know Dad died <p> Ah ha , Julia thought . Ahh . <p> And Henry covered for them each well enough , she supposed . It helped that everybody got quickly drunk . Now he talked a lot about being an independent luthier-his shop in Prescott , Arizona . Where ? He talked a lot about the new apprentice he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories about growing up with the rich and not yet famous-the bankers and the other billionaires . Apparently , the brothers had played a lot of pranks , too , being raised as they had on Mount Olympus . At the table , where they ordered those tall glasses of beer , she put her hand in Lucas 's lap . <p> To give him a rise . To let him know she was here just for him . <p> Julia , Henry said , his eyes winking in the candlelight . So you 're finishing your Ph.D. ? <p> Hera got up to pee . <p> Athena thought , looking at Aphrodite , I wonder if she 's gained a little weight ? <p> Poseidon said , looking at the God of War 's inflamed person-hood , Mine 's bigger . <p> Is not , Apollo said . Not by a long shot . <p> Is too . <p> Is not ! <p> Oh God , said Zeus . You guys are killing me ! <p> Poseidon bust a gut , and the red sea filled with blood . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any doubt of that . At least the better man for her . It struck her instantly , a moment of fundamental recognition , Aristotelian in its clarity : this act of infidelity , it had set into stone her heart 's conviction . She would marry Lucas . <p> And she would never , never look back . <p> In the narrow hallway leading to the hotel lobby , which was tricky , Henry took her arm and said , I 've never been unfaithful . Not once . <p> She said , We did something wrong only if we make it wrong . <p> Excuse me ? <p> She said , Promise me , promise me you will never tell . <p> I promise , Henry said . <p> Not a soul . <p> No , Henry said . Not a living soul . <p> Zeus slapped his knee so hard he put it out of joint- <p> That night , while he wept , she held Lucas to her breast . <p> She stroked his hair . <p> There , she said to this man who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . The matter is settled . <p> Like the death of his father , there would be no going back . <p> Tears in his eyes , that 's what came next . Poor Zeus , next he 'd be needing arthroscopic surgery . Rain , and that flash of unexpected temper you could see for miles and miles across the sky- <p> Fuck , Zeus said , blinking at his knee . That smarts . <p> The Guitar , which Henry builds , and Lucas plays- <p> The first guitar was the lyre , that to which we sing all the stories . Daphne , running through the sea grass , her heart throbbing like a minnow 's . Mentor , the Teacher ; Dionysus , the Orgasm , and the great unlocking of the heart 's desire to know itself . Achilles , say , and the Aegean Sea lapping at the seawall , and the post-coital oblivion which always precedes the Fall of Troy ; Helen , standing up for Paris , just to tease ; Hector on the ramparts , defending the family 's values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly at the wet spot ; Athena , bearing always politely her shield . Ares , cornering Aphrodite in the kitchen at a cocktail party , cupping her ass behind the granite countertop . <p> And she his . <p> And Artemis , Sweet Artemis-goddess of childbirth and the hunt . <p> Or Odysseus , on the shores of the modern world , dallying with a topless Calypso , still hoping all the while to catch in due course the tide that will carry him back home <p> To his wife and son . <p> Henry builds . Lucas plays . The guitar 's body , the very instrument-which so resembles the body of a woman : the hips ; the gently proud swell of the upper bout ; the waist which so invites itself to be draped , as if by a lover 's sleeve . <p> The tone-woods vary . For example , koa is not the same as walnut , or mahogany , or rosewood . Lucas , she thinks . He prefers a heart of walnut , and walnut is her favorite . Not just for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for its hue . <p> The next morning , walking alone with Henry to the car to say goodbye , so glad to meetcha , she said , You should know we 're going to be seeing a lot of each other . <p> We are ? <p> I think so . She said , I promise not to think bad of you . I know you 're not a rat-dog . <p> Mm-hmmm . <p> She said , But you have to make one more promise . To me . <p> What 's that ? <p> Do n't think bad of me , either . <p> He stepped back , he held up his shortened thumb ; he closed one eye to measure the distance of something off in the Berkshires . I grew up here , he said . <p> Yes , she said . I know that . <p> He said , I 'll think bad of me , you think bad of you , and then let 's get over it . <p> You mean do n't beat yourself up <p> I mean , Henry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course I wo n't think bad of you . <p> And then she kissed his cheek . <p> We delight in tricks especially after the fact : those we play , those played on us . Tricks are fun . Tricks remind the players not to lose the mystery for the sleight of hand . <p> It 's the first rule for all Magicians : Show , do n't Tell . <p> Nonetheless , she would regret : <p> Never meeting Lucas and Henry 's mother while she was alive ; not praising more effusively the awkward portrait of their father with a white dog hanging in an empty room filled with other awkward portraits ; coming to the funeral to begin with ; watching earlier that week a sexy French film by herself in a darkened theater ; being angry with Lucas for not showing up while he was being driven with a concussion and shards of glass in his eye to the hospital by strangers dressed in foul-weather gear ; not being there with Lucas while his head was being stitched up and scanned , his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , an image she can simply not forget ( having been etched into her mind not by the details of the moment but rather by the plausible memento those details left in their wake ) ; drinking rum on an empty stomach , and licking her lips in public ; not wearing a nametag ; going to the movies by herself ; driving through a storm across multiple state lines . <p> Wailed Hephaestus , pointing at Love and War , and still tearing at his thinning hair , But it 's not fair ! <p> Oh shut the fuck up . <p> Perhaps she had n't tangled with Henry . Had sex ? Certainly not made love . But fucked and tweaked and maybe blown ? Blow is what storms do , when they toss up the Aegean like a salad ; or you , when you 're late for work and still ca n't find your glasses , and your keys ... <p> Tangled-finally and at last , an appropriate seeming verb . <p> Perhaps she had n't tangled with Henry . Perhaps she 'd tangled with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Henry . <p> Is n't that the way it always went in stories ? <p> Gotcha <p> Julia is a medievalist , so she knows all the stories , and then some . Too , they all come from the same impulse : the seminal root . King Arthur , for example , was conceived by Uther Pendragron . Disguised , Uther came to Igrayne in the shape of her husband and took her blindly in the dark . In the movie he rides a stallion over a bank of clouds and never drops his mail . Love is blind ; in the bar of the White Hart Inn , Lucas wore an eyepatch ; Camelot was born . <p> But first it required a bit of magic : Merlin , whipping up a spell . Fiddling with the lights . Setting properly the mood . <p> Theater . She thinks , years later , It 's all magic . <p> Poof . <p> Taken-that 's a word indicating possession , nine-tenths of which apparently made anything legal whatsoever . <p> She took a trip , she took her orals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him take her own- <p> Said the man on the plane in first class with the **27;2257;TOOLONG watch , What do you do with English , anyway ? <p> A simple case of mistaken identity . Happens all the time . Like Leda and that handsome swan , or the boy you admire surreptitiously on the subway : the one you 've started dressing for . Desperate to catch his eye , and terrified you will , and that he 'll wink- <p> For days she went , If only- <p> If only the tall man had not been reading that one book or resembled so oddly her own lover ; if only she had n't seen the week before that feelm about a woman and an older man and a sexy hookup in a quaint hotel ( in French , the story just sounded better ! ) ; if only Lucas had not been driven off the road ; if only she had n't three months earlier quarreled with Lucas about men and women and their attitudes toward fidelity ( and the French ) ; if only Henry had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had once cut something off larger than his thumb ; if only she had not been so entranced by the name of the hotel to begin with , the White Hart Inn ( who stays in a place with a name like that ? ) ; if only she had n't been trying to prove something ( I do love Lucas ? I can have meaningless sex ? I 'm hungry , too ? ) ; if only she 'd gotten lost permanently in Torrington , Connecticut ; stayed at another hotel ; taken the Concorde off to Paris ... <p> Then the days passed into weeks , and the days preceding disappeared from view , like life itself . It 's gone before you know it . <p> You slip inside the slip-dream . <p> And she knows it 's not the detail which means ; it is instead the context the detail finds itself at swim in . It is the very lesson of all of life 's literature : detail is meaningful only in context . <p> It 's the confluence , the bringing together of miscellaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for meaning . It is the confluence of seemingly random events which invites the story to be told . People , especially those you meet on planes ... people think literature is the study only of books , but they 're mistaken . <p> And the best stories are always those you 've promised yourself not to tell . <p> A life-changing moment ? <p> Tristram falls in love with Isolde by way of a magic potion-that 's the lesson there . Be careful what you drink . Read the label , look to see where it 's been bottled . <p> Meaningless sex , she does n't get that , either . How can sex be meaningless ? Maybe she 's just a prissy English teacher , but sex is meaningless ? <p> It can be bad . It can infect you with disease . Its supply or lack can break apart a marriage , or a family . It can be casual , like a handshake over dinner , or a pair of Keds in the den . It can dress you up with silks and semiprecious stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can ring like two teenaged kids throughout heaven 's bell . It can take you to the moon , loft you into hyperspace . <p> But if it 's meaningless , genuinely meaningless , then why have at it to begin with ? Why take all the risk ? And then why take the fall ? <p> If life has meaning , then so , too , must sex , even if that meaning is in fact fluid-susceptible to change , to your heart 's course , the currents of your own and private slip-dream . <p> The accidents of life , she thinks . The accidents which deliver you along the way- <p> Like the universe , and the thunderous bang from which all of life did first explode- <p> The big bang , she thinks . <p> First it made the universe , and then it made her firstborn son . <p> God 's little secret , how to brew a storm , as if it were a parenthesis <p> This is what she told the man on the plane with the hundred-thousand-dollar watch . <p> She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loan me your sixty-thousand-dollar pen . <p> She said , holding the pen , Nice pen . <p> He thought she was going to give him her number , she knew that . Sometimes it was fun to tease . She said , What do I do with English ? <p> Well , yeah . What do you do with that ? <p> She wrote the words Wine and Dark and Sea . <p> See ? <p> You betcha . So now what ? <p> She said , Watch closely now- <p> Uh-huh . <p> Are you watching ? <p> I 'm watching- <p> And then she placed a hyphen , a single black mark , between the words Wine and Dark . <p> Wine-Dark Sea <p> The man said , So ? <p> She said , capping the pen , giving it back to him , When you place a hyphen between the words wine and dark , do you know what you have done ? <p> Uh-uh . <p> You 've turned water into wine . <p> Wine-dark , he said , puzzling it out . Wine-dark sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think just anybody can do that ? <p> Take Artemis : goddess of childbirth , and the hunting of the White Stag . <p> Poetry , like our lives , moves precisely because it always is in motion . <p> If only ? <p> She thanks God it happened . She thanks God she lives a life marked by joy and mistake , bewilderment and surprise . <p> At first a little social awkwardness , a secret to keep for life-it 's a price she easily can bear . <p> Certainly , too , she has always known what will never leave Henry 's mind . What has always been on Henry 's mind . After Lucas , Henry and Penelope were the first to know . A baby on the way . Henry might have had a child had he never lost his own . Henry knows his figures ; he knows how to do the math . <p> At her wedding , six months into her pregnancy , Julia wore an ivory gown . <p> The gown , it cascaded a river of light along the pregnant slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore flowers in her hair . <p> She wore her pale yellow hair up in a chignon . <p> She wore a pearl necklace she knew Lucas could not afford . <p> She bought for Lucas a well-used copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica . The world , she said . I wanted to give you everything that 's in it . <p> Her dad said , Just look at her . I always thought she was going to be a thespian . <p> Penelope said , Mm-mmmm . <p> You know , said Julia 's dad . Like an actor . <p> Penelope promised a tapestry which would take years to unfold <p> At Julia 's wedding , Henry danced with her , his body bumping into her tender own . I 'm sorry , he said , clumsily . <p> She said , Drink some more champagne . <p> He said , I will . <p> She said , placing Henry 's hand to her body , Life springs from life . <p> I guess . <p> She said , Henry , you 're going to be an uncle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Like his own children , it is a topic he will never raise . <p> And now , Ardent Owen , lifting his blue binoculars to the horizon <p> Do you see ? Owen asks , pointing to the ledge of the horizon . <p> Can you ? <p> Another trick : when you 're young , you want a man ; and when you 're grown-up , God how you do so want a boy . <p> And she would not-she can not ever-regret : <p> Holding Lucas , this boy , to her breast . <p> Becoming pregnant-either by Lucas or her older brother-in-law , whichever the case may be . Gotcha . First came the flush , and then the last laugh , which is a lot like coming home . On the way back to Troy , Paris got tangled in the sheets , too . It 's not the size of the boat ; it 's the motion of the ocean . Lots of oxygen flushing out the bloodstream . To wit : that entire month to follow Julia and Lucas made the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having quickened , they conjugated their verbs fluently and in public : cover-up sex , she called it , on an elevator , on a rooftop , in parking lots and lakes . Once in a swanky hotel pool . God , she said to Lucas , skinny-dipping in a pool . I 've always wanted to do this . Then they did this more . On stairways . On a train . On the park bench , in the sun , her yellow skirt spread about his hips like the day 's sun , his hand to her hot chest . They fucked like there was no tomorrow because when you are in love-and when you are in fact making love to the one you love-it 's positively true : <p> There is no tomorrow . <p> There is only now , this life you hold together with your own two hands <p> And what she will not , what she can never , regret is the moment after . The moment after she understood for certain she was pregnant . The moment after when she asked Lucas then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what Julia loves most about the story-this story she can never tell , not even to you-is the way its influence has evolved . Its amplitude and reach . The day after , for example , she wanted to jump off a bridge , or take into each hand a downed high-voltage wire . A month later , in her small bathroom back in California , the pregnancy test stick in her hand , sitting down to pee-she placed her hand to her heart and held her breath . <p> A year after the event ? She opened up her blouse . <p> And now , seven years ? <p> And how about the years to come ? <p> Owen , she calls her son . The Ardent One . <p> Author Affiliation
