Perfect they were not-but America 's utopian communities are fascinating to this day . // SOME TIME AROUND 1790 , a planter and self-proclaimed prophet named George Rapp was stirring things up in Germany . He 'd publicly rejected the Lutheran church-a serious offense  --  and was preaching his own form of Christianity , prompting repeated conflicts with church and governmental officials . By 1800 , Rapp and his followers , who called themselves Harmonists , had decided to leave Germany and establish a settlement where their religion could flourish . Happily for them , across the ocean was a new country where religious freedom had been codified into law : the United States of America . From the Pilgrims to the Branch Davidians , America has long been a haven and spawning ground for disaffected clans seeking to start utopian communities and achieve heaven on earth . The most fertile time for this phenomenon was the 1800s , when several factors  --  lenient immigration laws , Manifest Destiny , the promise and excitement of a new nation-converged to make America a magnet for groups like the Harmonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been preserved as living museums , complete with guided tours . I 've always been intrigued by utopian groups , and not just because utopia is such an inherently seductive concept . Utopian leaders-typically charismatic figures with messiah complexes , like George Rapp were usually fascinating head cases . And their civic frameworks , which tended to be communal , with members renouncing private property , were often grand social experiments . So while touring a utopian site is in some ways much like visiting any historical village-here 's the blacksmith shop , here 's the general store and so on-a utopian tour has the added backdrop of the group 's beliefs and lifestyle , which were usually , shall we say , a tad eccentric . Imagine Colonial Williamsburg populated by Trotskyite flat-earth worshipers , and you start to get the idea . Let 's begin with George Rapp and his Harmonists , nearly 800 of whom came to America in 1804 . After two short-lived settlements , in 1824 they acquired 3,000 acres in what is now Ambridge , Pa. , just northwest of Pittsburgh . This site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 years . Today a portion of it remains as Old Economy Village ( 724  --  266-4500 ; **25;1951;TOOLONG ) , a beautiful , six-acre collection of houses , workshops , gardens and exhibits . Rapp preached that Christ 's Second Coming was imminent , so in 1807 the Harmonists adopted celibacy in order to purify themselves for the great day Their notion of purification , however , did n't apply to alcohol , which they made for both their own consumption and outside sale . The massive underground wine cellar , featuring a vaulted ceiling and the original oak fermentation barrels , is among the most impressive sights at Old Economy . Moreover , the entire village is crawling with grapevines , just as in the 1800s-not only in designated vineyards , but also on stone walls and the sides of buildings . It is n't exactly creepy-after all , they 're just grapes-but something about it seems oddly askew , which is a good way to think of utopian sites in general and of the Harmonists in particular . The Harmonists attracted occasional new followers over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two living members dissolved the group in 1905 . Celibacy has also taken a toll on the Shakers , probably America 's best-known communal utopists . Founded in the late 1700s by the British visionary Mother Ann Lee , who believed she was the female incarnation of the Second Coming , the Shakers at one point had some 5,000 members living in 19 villages from New England to Kentucky ( one of which , in Maine , is still active , although now with only a handful of adherents ) . Many of these sites have been preserved , most notably Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield , Mass. ( 800-817-1137 ; **28;1978;TOOLONG ) , which was established in 1783 and active until 1960 . Hancock is still a large , sophisticated site , with a working farm and 20 meeting halls , residences , workshops and other buildings , several of which-particularly the 1826 circular stone barn  --  are architectural gems . Knowledgeable employees explain Shaker life . I especially liked the kitchen demonstration , where a staffer made bread and pies in a woodburning brick oven and fritters in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set your hands to work and give your hearts to God " is evident everywhere-not just in words but in the stoic , hard-toiling spirit of staffers , who show how to make the furniture and crafts for which the Shakers are best known . At some points , this virtuous lifestyle seems inspiring ; at others-such as when you learn that the Shakers enforced gender separation so strictly that men and women had separate entrances to their residences-it seems rather grim . Either way , however , the Shaker story is an engrossing one , and it 's easy to spend an entire day here . Although the Harmonists and Shakers were swimming against the actuarial tide , so to speak , not all utopian groups were celibate . Quite the contrary , in fact , in the case of the Perfectionists , a 250  --  member group founded in 1848 by John Humphrey Noyes , a defrocked Vermont preacher . Noyes advocated " complex marriage , " in which each man was considered a husband to all the community 's women , and each woman a wife to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even close friendships were discouraged in favor of strict communalism , with children raised collectively by the entire group , and living arrangements periodically rotated to prevent any members from becoming too closely attached . Bizarre as this all might seem , the Perfectionists ( so named because they believed the , Second Coming had occurred in A.D.70 , malting humans free from sin and thereby capable of achieving perfection ) were a successful , functional community . They lived together for 32 years , primarily in a huge Victorian mansion in Oneida , NY This building is now preserved as the Oneida Community Mansion House ( 315-363-0745 ; www.oneidacommunity . org ) , where visitors can take guided tours and learn about other aspects of Perfectionist life , which included tomboyish female clothing and hairstyles that were quite progressive for their time ; a eugenics program that resulted in 58 selectively bred children ; and a novel form of birth control , whose precise details are best left for your guide to explain ( trust me ) . You can even stay the night in the mansions comfortably refurbished rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guest services offered . Like most utopian communities , the Perfectionists supported themselves via assorted businesses , one of which was manufacturing silverware . When the community dissolved in 1880-in part because Noyes , fearing morals charges , had fled to Canada-the silverware enterprise was incorporated as Oneida Ltd. , which is still locally headquartered and has become a world-class brand . Along with Shaker furniture and Amana appliances ( see box on the opposite page ) , Oneida flatware is among the most visible and surprising examples of how these fringe groups have intersected with mainstream American life-tangible remnants of heaven on earth . Sidebar Other would-be utopias Sidebar Zoar Village State Memorial ( Zoar , Ohio ; 800-262-6195 ; www.ohiohistory.org /places/zoar ) . Much like George Rapp 's Harmonists , the Zoarites were breakaway German Lutherans . Helped by a loan from the Quakers , they acquired land in eastern Ohio in 1817 and lived there communally until 1898 . Ten of their buildings , including homes , businesses and trade shops , are exhibited via guided tours , as is a massive garden with a biblically inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amana , Iowa ; 319-622-3567 ; www.amanaheritage.org ) . Founded by German Inspirationists in 1855 , the seven communal Amana colonies gave birth to Amana Refrigeration , now a popular appliance brand . Many homes and businesses can be toured , but Amana may have become too successful for its own good-awash in Ye Olde Curio Shoppes and the like , it 's now more redolent of hucksterism than of history . Koreshan State Historic Site ( Estero , Fla. ; 941-992-0311 ; www.captiva.com /stateparks/Koreshan.htm ) . Once home to 200 members , this site was founded in 1894 by Cyrus Teed , a New York physician who believed that the earth was hollow and that the rest of the cosmos existed inside of it-a contention he and his group " proved " with homemade scientific instruments . Twelve buildings remain for public tours . Sidebar Historic Rugby ( Rugby , Tenn. ; 423-628-2441 ; www.historicrugby.org ) . Not all utopian sites were religiously inspired .
