On the afternoon it rained frogs , sun perch , and minnows , Sunset discovered she could take a beating good as Three-Fingered Jack . Unlike Jack , who had taken his in the sunshine , she took hers in her own home at the tail end of a cyclone , the windows rattling , the roof lifting , the hardwood floor cold as stone . She was on her back wearing only the top half of her dress , because the bottom half had been ripped away when Pete , during the process of beating her , had stepped on it , and the dress , rotten as politics , had torn and left her clothed only from waist to shoulders . It went through her mind that she was down to two dresses now , and that she hated to see this one go , as it , though faded , had a flowery pattern she liked and the colors blended well with the stains . But this was a passing thought . She was mostly thinking : How can I stop him from hitting me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands up , but he was beating them down , and her own arms and hands flying back into her face were doing near the damage his fists might have . Finally , he hammered her to the floor , followed her down , spread her legs , went to tearing and clawing off the rest of her clothes . When the top of her dress ripped open and he jerked loose one side of her bra , revealing her , he said , " There 's that tittie . " His speech was slurred and his breath seemed to bleed alcohol . He raked at her undergarments , tore them and tossed them . When he snapped his gun belt free , he tossed it nearby , and while he was on her , tugging at his zipper , trying to put the mule in the barn , Sunset reached over and slipped his .38 revolver from its holster , and withouthim being aware , put it to his head , gave him one in the temple . When she pulled the trigger the shot was loud as Gabriel blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to heaven . Or departed anyway . Sunset liked to think he got a nice chair in hell , right next to the oven . But in that moment , the shot made her scream , once , sharp and hard as if she had taken the bullet , or as if she had just received a slap on the bottom at birth . Pete went limp , not only in the organ he had intended to use , but all over . He said not a word . No " Ouch , " " Oh shit , " or " Can you believe that ? " Things he liked to say under normal circumstances , moments of surprise and duress . He just took the hot load , cut a fart near loud as the .38 shot , collapsed , and rode on out on Death 's black horse . If it was n't bad enough she had lost her dress , underclothes , and dignity , now all the windows on the east side shook like Marley 's chains , then exploded . The door leaped apart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected puzzle , and the wind took the roof away . She lay there on her back , fragments of clothes fastened to her body , her old flat-heeled shoes still on her feet , a piece of window glass poking out of her shoulder , Pete lying heavy against her . She still had the gun in her hand . The shot had gone in small and had n't come out big like she expected . It must have been a bad load , jumping around in his brain , making jelly of it . Blood ran from the wound , out of his nose and onto her . She rolled him off and looked at him . No mistaking . He was n't going to recover from this . " Surprised you , did n't I ? " Sunset said . She studied Pete for a long moment , then started to scream as if a banshee were inside of her . But it was n't screaming you would have heard if you had been in the other room . It was loud enough , but the storm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whined . Then , except for the floor , two ugly chairs , an iron cookstove , Sunset and the dead man , it was all sucked up and thrown lickety-split on down country . Sunset , screaming , clung to the floor while the storm raved on . The moment the storm passed , the sky turned clear and the sun poked out and stoked up the heat . It was as if the cool wind and rain had never been . Sunset stood up , weak and bleeding , fragments of her clothes falling from her . She pulled the piece of glass from her shoulder . It came out smooth without causing too much damage , hardly any blood . Naked , except for her shoes and the gun she was holding , she wandered off of what remained of her house , stumbled down the muddy clay road in front of the place , frogs , minnows , and perch hopping and flapping beneath her shoes . She felt as lost as Cain after he killed Abel . She saw Pete 's car , turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak trees as if it had been made of wet licorice . Nearby , his wooden file cabinet was burst open and there were files all over the place . Fatefully , she came across one of her curtains , made from a flour sack and dyed blue . It had wrapped itself around a scrub tree limb and was hanging there like it was on the arm of a valet . Sunset draped it around the lower part of her body , pulled her long red hair down over her breasts , started down the road again , mud squishing around her shoes . Stooping to yank a mashed frog from the bottom of her shoe , she looked up to see the colored knife sharpener , Uncle Riley , coming down the road with his two mules and wagon . Uncle Riley 's son , Tommy , was walking alongside him , spearing sun perch from the ground with a sharp stick , flipping them into the wagon bed . Uncle Riley pulled on the reins when he saw her , said , " Oh , hell . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Tommy , he ai n't neither . We ai n't seeing a thing . " But Tommy was seeing plenty . Sunset 's breasts were poking through her red hair , and Tommy had never seen breasts before , white or black , except those of his mama when suckling , but that was a long-lost memory . Sunset , at that moment , did n't care who saw what . She was bleeding from nose and mouth and her eyes were starting to swell shut . She felt as if she had been set on fire and put out with a yard rake . " Uncle Riley , " she said , " it 's me , Sunset . I been beat . " " Oh , Lord , chile , you sure have . I 'm gon na get down and help you . Do n't shoot at nothing now , you hear ? " Sunset staggered to one knee , tried to get up , could n't . Uncle Riley , who was six-four and forty-four , weighed two-twenty and had a slick bald head he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon , took off his work shirt , kept his head turned as he walked toward her . Uncle Riley put the shirt over Sunset 's shoulders . She dropped the curtain and pulled the shirt shut and buttoned it with her free hand . All this from where she knelt on one knee . She tried again to get up , but could n't . Uncle Riley lifted her into his arms easy as a child . She clung to the pistol as if it were a part of her hand . He carried her to the wagon and set her on the seat , climbed up beside her . " Now I ai n't touching on you , Miss Sunset . " " It 's okay , Uncle Riley . You 've been a real gentleman . " Tommy , who was standing beside the wagon with a fish stuck on the end of his pointed stick , had yet to close his mouth . " Get on up here , " Uncle Riley said . Tommy climbed in the back of the wagon with the fish they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon bed to the other , and in places they were ankle deep . Uncle Riley had seen the rain of fish as a bonus from God . Fish to eat , fish to salt and smoke for later . They had even gathered a few frogs because Tommy 's mama , the midwife , Cary , liked frog legs . Now Tommy wondered if the fish would keep because it was turning hot again and they were having to haul around this beat-up , big-tittied white woman . What in heaven 's name were they going to do with her ? Tommy thought : Her hair is so long and red and wild it looks like tumbling fire . He smiled to himself . Good Lord , he had seen fish rain from the skies and he had seen a white woman 's tits . It had been a special day . " Miss Sunset , I haul you around like this , they gon na kill me , " Uncle Riley said . " Not with me with you they wo n't . " Sunset heard her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were all a dream . She scratched a place behind her ear with the barrel of the .38 . " Missy , they ai n't gon na believe me . They ai n't gon na believe you . " " They 'll believe me . " " My cousin Jim , he just seen a white woman bending over in her yard , taking hanging clothes from a basket , and though there was n't nothing to see cause she had her clothes on and he was up on the road , a white man seen him look at her , and for that , the word got around and them Kluxers took Jim out and castrated him , poured turpentine on thecuts . " " I tell you , it 'll be okay . " " What 's your husband , Mr. Pete , gon na say ? " " He ai n't gon na say nothing , Uncle Riley . I blew his brains out . " " Oh , my goodness . " " Take me to my mother-in-law 's . " " Sure you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My daughter 's there . Ai n't got nowhere else to go . " " Do n't know Miss Marilyn gon na take kindly to you shooting her boy . " " I 'll cross that bridge when I get to it . Oh , God , what is Karen going to think ? " " She surely loves her daddy . " " She does . " " They gon na castrate me and my boy . " " No , they 're not . I 'll see to it . For heaven 's sake , Uncle Riley , I 've known you all my life . Your wife helped deliver my baby . " " White folks forget them things when they want to . And with this Depression on , people just meaner anyhow . " The storm had come so fast and furious , it was hard to accept all the sunlight and heat , but already the fish in the back of the wagon were beginning to smell . The leather harnesses creaked and the oat-and-hay-stoked bellies of the mules made strange gurgling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tails and farted or did their business , jerked their heads and snatched at greenery , and there was plenty of it , because the trail was narrow and the limbs of trees poked out over it , tempting the mules with their leaves . The wagon squeaked and jostled along the muddy road and the steam from the mud drying rose up in thin wisps and there was a smell like pottery firing in a kiln . The sun burned and gnawed at Sunset 's wounds and bruises . " I feel like I 'm gon na pass out , " Sunset said . " Do n't do that , now , Miss Sunset . It bad enough you near naked riding along with a nigger , you do n't need to have your head on my shoulder . " Sunset dipped her head and the feeling passed . When she sat back up and started to wipe her forehead with the back of her hand , she realized the gun was still in it . " Maybe I ought to leave this with you ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun with me . Next thing I know , I 'm the one done shot him . " " I 'll explain . " " White folks find him dead , then see me , they gon na want a nigger anyhow . They see Mr. Pete 's gun in my wagon , and him being a lawman and all , me and this boy be strung up faster than you can say , ' Let 's get us a nigger . ' " " All right , " Sunset said . " I thank you and Tommy , I truly do . " " Besides , you might need that gun when you tell Miss Marilyn what you done did . And you do n't need it for her , you might need it for her husband , Mr. Jones . " " When I tell my daughter , I might want to use it on myself . " " Do n't talk like that now . " " I ca n't believe I did it . " " He beat on you like that , Miss Sunset , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man beats on a woman . You done what you had to do . " " I could have just shot him in the leg or the foot , I guess . " " You done what you had to do . " Uncle Riley studied her face . " Damn , Miss Sunset , ai n't seen a beating that bad since he whupped up on Three-Fingered Jack . You remember that ? " " I do . " " Boy , he beat that man like he stole something . " " He did . My husband 's girlfriend . " " Guess I ought not to have brought that up . " " He taught me how to shoot , Uncle Riley . Can you believe that ? Taught me how to shoot a pistol , shotgun and rifle . Taught me until he thought maybe I was getting too good . After we married , he did n't want me to do nothing ... I ca n't believe I shot him . I could have just got hit and he 'd have got what he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . Karen would have a daddy . Thing is , though , he could have had what he wanted without all that , Uncle Riley . I 'd have given in without all that . All he 'd have to have done was talk sweet . But he liked it rough , even if he did n't have to . I think he was sweet to his girlfriends , but me , he beat . " " Do n't talk to me about that , girl . I do n't need to hear about it . " " He was bad enough about such , but when he drank , he was mean as a cottonmouth . " " Your hair sure is red , " Tommy said . " Damn , boy , " Uncle Riley said . " Miss Sunset do n't need you talking about her hair right now . Get on back there and sort them fish out or something . " " They all the same . " " Well , count them , boy . " " It 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mama used to say red as sunset , so that 's what people call me . " " That ai n't your name ? " Tommy asked . " It is now . In the Bible they wrote Carrie Lynn Beck . But everyone called me Sunset . Got married I became Jones . " Sunset burst into tears . " Go on back there now and sit down , " Uncle Riley told Tommy . " I did n't do nothing , " Tommy said . " Boy , you want your ass shined ? Go back there . " Tommy moved back a ways , sat down amidst the fish . They were still damp and wet against his pants and he did n't like it , but he sat . He knew he had pushed about as far as he could push , and the next push the wagon would stop and he 'd have his daddy 's hand across the seat of his pants , or worse , he 'd have to go break off his own switch for his daddy to use .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
