Before Great Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 , democratic reforms had been introduced in the colony . Major democratic reforms were carded out when the last British governor , Christopher Patten , introduced his constitutional package in 1992 . Those reforms included expansion of the electoral franchise in elections to the legislature ( called the Legislative Council ) and the abolition of appointed membership in district boards and regional councils . In addition , the Public Order Ordinance was relaxed to allow public processions without prior police approval . <p> Because Hong Kong is now under the sovereignty of a Communist regime , there are concerns about whether democratic initiatives and the momentum for democracy can be preserved . Patten , in his last policy address , suggested a list of questions and conditions governing the success of democratic consolidation in Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty. ( n1 ) In this article I consider the process of establishing a democratic political system in Hong Kong and its prospects for success . Calling on theories of democratic consolidation to provide an analytical framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been weak since the hand-over to China . The top political leaders , together with objective political conditions , are restraining democratic development . The process of democratic consolidation will be smoother if Hong Kong acquires leaders who truly believe in Western democratic principles and wholeheartedly promote democratic reforms . Consolidation of Democracy : Essentials and Conditions <p> The essentials of liberal democracy can be found in the philosophical ideas of Aristotle ( government by the many ) , Abraham Lincoln ( government of the people , by the people , and for the people ) , Montesquieu ( checks and balances ) , and John Locke ( government by consent ) . William Kornhauser associated the origins of democracy with pluralist societies . He suggested that " where the introduction of democratic rule is based on a pluralist society , especially a balance of classes and social groups , it will tend to be strong and viable . " ( n2 ) Similarly , Daniel Lerner hypothesized that " the toleration of diverse interests , media exposure , different demands , and political participation would sustain democracy . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a consolidated democracy , " a polity has to undertake political modernization which involves the rationalization of authority , the differentiation of new political functions , the development of specialized structures to perform these functions , and the increased participation in politics by social groups . " ( n4 ) Focusing on the objective environment , Robert Dahl proposed six factors that would affect the likelihood of democratic consolidation : concentration in the socioeconomic order , socioeconomic development , inequality , subcultural cleavages , foreign control , and the beliefs of political leaders. ( n5 ) Inspired by Dahl 's idea , Tatu Vanhanen advanced the concept of " power resources , " defined as any resources that could be used to change and affect others ' behavior. ( n6 ) According to Vanhanen , an even distribution of power resources would result in a democracy ; a concentration of power resources would lead to an autocratic political system . Thus democracy is consolidated under the condition of wide distribution of power resources among various political actors . <p> A recent contribution to the theories of democratic consolidation by Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linz and Stepan , democratic consolidation means that a polity has completed a democratic transition and that its government is ruled democratically. ( n7 ) A " consolidated democracy " is a political regime in which democracy has become the only game in town . In an attempt to integrate the conditions for consolidation , Linz and Stepan group them under five aspects of consolidated democracy : a free and lively civil society , a relatively autonomous political society , a strong system of rule of law , a usable bureaucracy , and an institutionalized economic society . In their view , a modern consolidated democracy comprises those five major interrelated arenas ; each arena needs support from the others or has an impact on the others. ( n8 ) The five conditions provide a systematic measurement of the degree of democratic consolidation and help us to project the prospects for democratization . Consolidation of Democracy in Hong Kong <p> A comprehensive analysis of the conditions of democratic consolidation in Hong Kong suggests that only one condition  --  an institutionalized economic society with a high degree of market autonomy and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four conditions are either weak or in the process of being undermined . In this section I discuss Hong Kong 's circumstances with respect to those four conditions . <p> 1 . The Development of Civil Society <p> In a free and lively civil society , self-organizing and relatively autonomous groups , movements , and individuals attempt to articulate values , to create associations and solidarities , and to advance their interests. ( n9 ) Various groups , such as trade unions , professional organizations , business chambers , religious groups , and neighborhood associations , can be freely formed and actively engaged in articulating their interests with minimal constraints . A robust civil society should therefore have the capacity to generate political alternatives and to monitor government . In that case , civil society can help to consolidate and deepen democracy . <p> In the colonial era , government by consultation and by elites absorbed from privileged groups was the dominant form of politics in Hong Kong . Pressure groups consequently became the only organizations that formally interacted with the government . Business and professional groups ( for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite members of society , had better access to the government . Those elite groups could exert pressure on policymakers because of their important positions in society . Pressure groups at the grassroots level , such as the Society for Community Organization and the People 's Council on Public Housing , occasionally exerted pressure on the government when their interests were jeopardized by government policies . Their basic objectives were to fight against social injustice and to alleviate the sufferings of the poor . The unclear future of Hong Kong in the midst of the Sino-British negotiations of the early 1980s activated middle-class people to organize a new type of pressure group to articulate their views on the future of the territory . Some of the new groups , such as the Meeting Point ( formed in 1983 ) and the Hong Kong Affairs Society ( formed in 1984 ) , were well organized and focused on commenting on the political future of Hong Kong rather than on participating in the black box of decision making . Hence they were regarded as " groups of political commentary . " ( n10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise their influence mainly in the functional constituencies of the Hong Kong Legislative Council . As a way to prepare for an elected legislature after 1997 and to let the people of Hong Kong practice elections , the colonial government initiated the development of representative government in 1985 . Functional constituencies based on economic and professional fields were created , such that members of specific functional sectors could elect among themselves representatives to articulate their interests in the legislature . Those functional constituencies included , for example , the teaching , legal , accountancy , business , labor , medical , tourism , entertainment , agricultural , and fishery sectors . Their representatives currently occupy thirty of the sixty seats in the Hong Kong Legislative Council . As a result , pressure groups from individual functional sectors are encouraged and mobilized to express their views in the legislature . Other pressure groups that are not formally represented in the legislature continue to use conventional methods , such as strikes and demonstrations , to articulate their views to the government . <p> Political parties emerged after the colonial government introduced directly elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political activists recognized the need to build collective strength in the Legislative Council to increase their influence and to organize large-scale electoral campaigns for direct elections . Thus , like-minded political activists and politicians established their own political parties . The United Democrats of Hong Kong was formed in 1990 and later merged with the Meeting Point to form the Democratic Party in 1994 . The Cooperative Resources Centre was formed in 1991 and became the Liberal Party in 1993 . The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong ( DAB ) was established in 1992 . The Liberal Democratic Federation was formed in 1990 and later merged with the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance ( HKPA ) , formed in 1994 . <p> The Democratic Party , the Liberal Party , and the DAB became the dominant parties , exhibiting divergent views on the politics of Hong Kong . The Democratic Party advocates a democratic Hong Kong , free from intervention by Beijing . The business-oriented Liberal Party calls for the maintenance of the executive-led political system and the capitalist economic system . The pro-Beijing DAB supports a conservative political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hong Kong . In the 2000-2004 session , the distribution of seats in the Legislative Council exhibited a multiparty system . The Democratic Party took 12 seats ; the Liberal Party , 8 ; the DAB , 12 ; the HKPA , 4 ; the Frontier Party , 2 . The remaining seats went to the minor parties and " independents , " many of whom had close relationships with political parties and organizations . Though the seats in the Legislative Council are widely distributed among all of the political parties , in general they form two blocs : the democratic bloc ( led by the Democratic Party and the Frontier Party ) and the conservative bloc ( led by the Liberal Party , the DAB , and the HKPA ) . On almost all issues , voting in the Legislative Council is divisive and debates are heated between the two political blocs . An adversarial party politics has developed in Hong Kong. ( n11 ) <p> Although the majority of citizens remain politically passive and uninterested , political participation is growing in Hong Kong . Voter turnout has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turnout was 39 percent in 1991 , 36 percent in 1995 , 53 percent in 1998 , and 44 percent in 2000 . In district council elections the turnout was 32.5 percent in 1991 , 33.1 percent in 1994 , and 35.8 percent in 1999 . A survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong in 1999 showed that 60 percent of the respondents regarded voting as their responsibility and that 52 percent of the respondents thought voting had become a political habit. ( n12 ) In another academic study conducted in 1999 , 62.3 percent of the respondents agreed that " all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council should be directly elected . " Furthermore , 64.6 percent of the respondents agreed that " the Chief Executive of Hong Kong should be directly elected . " ( n13 ) These data showed that the people of Hong Kong had accepted democratic principles and had generated certain democratic aspirations . <p> However , the majority of citizens are still far from being active participants in politics . In the last study cited , 55.7 percent of the respondents admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others " ; 59.3 percent said that they " would not actively participate in public affairs " ; 87.5 percent said that they " never attended any activities organized by political parties " ; and 91.4 percent said that they " never attended any activities organized by pressure groups . " ( n14 ) These data revealed that , in general , the citizens of Hong Kong had not fully translated their democratic aspirations into political actions . One possible explanation is Hong Kong 's pragmatic political culture : The people of Hong Kong prefer democracy but can tolerate authoritarian rule in exchange for stability and peace . This explanation is based on the following findings : Two-thirds of the respondents ( 64.3% ) agreed that " if economic development and democratic reforms could not coexist , democracy would be sacrificed . " ( n15 ) Obviously , democracy is not at the top of the agenda for the majority of the people of Hong Kong . It is certainly true that the people accept and prefer democracy ; that is why the Democratic Party had greater electoral success than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quest for democracy is not so strong that people are willing to risk destabilization of the society and the economy by openly opposing the Beijing leadership on the issue . Their cautiousness is supported mainly by an assumption that the economy of Hong Kong will continue to prosper . However , the 1998 Asian financial crisis significantly weakened the Hong Kong economy , producing deflation , unemployment , and wage reduction ; in response , citizens expressed strong dissatisfaction with the government through demonstrations and strikes . Thus the people of Hong Kong might alter their priorities , depending on the level of prosperity and the economic performance of the government . <p> Even if citizens changed their priorities , the development of a lively and free civil society in Hong Kong would be slow . The distribution of resources and influence among pressure groups is very uneven ; the business and professional groups have greater financial and human resources , better access to government leaders in both Hong Kong and Beijing , and better chances of occupying leadership positions than do other groups . Members of the business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Executive Council , the Commission on Strategic Development , and the Central Policy Unit . Moreover , most members of the government advisory committees are also members of the business and professional groups . It is not surprising to find that many leaders of business and professional groups are representatives in the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) and the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference . Thus lower-class pressure groups are at a disadvantage . Trade unions , for example , are weak in Hong Kong ; they are constrained by the laws and lack collective bargaining power. ( n16 ) <p> Political parties also suffer from a number of constraints . First , the divided structure of the Legislative Council ( thirty seats returned from functional constituencies and another thirty from geographical constituencies ) minimizes the chance of there being a majority party in that body . It will be almost impossible for a single political party to take a majority of seats in both the functional and the geographical constituencies , which represent different interests . Second , the requirement that the chief executive not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from becoming a governing party . Third , the electoral system of proportional representation divides the seats of the legislature evenly among the parties , diluting their influence . Fourth , most members of political parties are part-time politicians who can not devote themselves wholeheartedly to political and party affairs . Fifth , political parties in Hong Kong lack popular support ; all have fewer than a thousand members . Sixth , the distrust of the Beijing leadership toward political parties and party politics in Hong Kong limits the political space in which parties can operate and exercise their influence . Beijing 's leaders strongly back Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his administration , encouraging them to exert executive leadership over the legislature to the fullest extent . As a consequence , the influence of political parties in decision making is limited . <p> Because of these constraints , political parties in Hong Kong can only play the role of opposition party in the Legislative Council . However , their contribution to the democratic process should not be underestimated . The main contribution of political parties is to influence the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vocal . The Democratic Party is the most outspoken in criticizing the administration , but even the conservative parties , such as the DAB and the Liberal Party , are sometimes critical of the government on issues that affect their interests . Political parties in Hong Kong make their views known through the mass media and organized activities . They shape public opinion , inform the public , and increase the political awareness of citizens . As a result , decision making in Hong Kong has changed from administrative to political and from consensual to confrontational . The parties are doing the groundwork for the development of democracy and waiting for the time to come . <p> Individual citizens are also subject to legal and political constraints . Tung 's 1997 amendment of the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance immediately after the hand-over limited the political rights and freedoms of individuals . The amended Societies Ordinance empowers the government to reject the registration of a new organization if it is thought to be a danger to the " national security or public safety " or to have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " public safety " and " foreign political connections " are vaguely defined , the amendment effectively limits the right to form societies . In the same vein , the amendment of the Public Order Ordinance empowers the police to withhold approval of a public procession on the grounds that the procession is not in the interests of " national security . " The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are thus restricted . Article 23 of the Basic Law(n17) further restricts the political behavior and activities of ordinary citizens by stipulating that " the Hong Kong government shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason , secession , sedition , subversion against the Chinese government , or theft of state secrets . " This article could be a powerful weapon for suppressing political opposition . <p> 2 . The Development of a Political Society <p> " Political society " refers to an arena in which political actors compete for the legitimate right to exercise control over public power and the state apparatus . Democratic consolidation requires that political actors , including government leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a representative legislature , an elected chief executive , an accountable administration , open and fair elections , and an effective party system . Agreed-upon political rules for acquiring , distributing , and exercising power in a democratic manner must be crafted . Otherwise , consolidation of democracy will not be possible . Consolidation of democracy also requires habituation to the norms and procedures of democratic conflict regulation. ( n18 ) <p> As a special administrative region ( SAR ) under the Chinese sovereignty , Hong Kong is not a democracy . The chief executive is not directly elected ; Tung was " selected " by the Selection Committee , which in turn was appointed by the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese government . The composition of the Selection Committee and that of the Preparatory Committee were similar : The members of both committees were pro-Beijing conservatives . <p> Similarly , no members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council are directly elected by the citizenry on the basis of universal franchise . In the 2000-2004 session , only twenty-four of the council 's sixty members were directly elected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based functional constituencies and from an election committee through indirect election . The Beijing government plans to allow half the seats in the legislature to be directly elected for the third term ( 2004-8 ) but no sooner. ( n19 ) <p> Not only is the chief executive not directly elected , but no system of political accountability is institutionalized . There is no ministerial accountability in the Hong Kong political system . The chief executive appoints members of the Executive Council , but they are not charged with any departmental portfolio . The council members are not ministers of government departments and do not control the departments ; thus they do not assume political responsibility either for policymaking or for implementation . Moreover , they are immune to scrutiny by the Legislative Council , being accountable only to the chief executive . Senior civil servants , who are the real policymakers , enjoy permanent tenure . Consequently , neither the members of the Executive Council nor the civil servants are held responsible for policy failures , and they are not accountable to the Legislative Council . <p> Under the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The council 's ability to pass an individual member 's bill is restrained by the use of separate bloc voting : According to the Basic Law , bills or amendments to government bills introduced by individual members require a simple majority vote in each of the two member groups , representing functional and geographical constituencies . In contrast , the passage of government bills requires only a simple majority of all members of the legislature . Thus passage of individual members ' bills is more difficult . Furthermore , the permitted scope of individual members ' bills is still very narrow . Those related to government policies must be approved by the chief executive before they are introduced ; individual members ' bills related to public expenditures , political structure , or government operations are prohibited . Moreover , the results of motion debates in the Legislative Council are not binding on the government . Thus the legislative and supervisory powers of the Legislative Council are subject to many constraints. ( n20 ) <p> The short-term prospects for developing a democratic society in Hong Kong with a fair and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . There is even evidence of reversal of the process of democratization under Tung since the hand-over . The Legislative Council became less representative when the number of eligible voters in functional constituencies was reduced from 2.7 million to 240,000 . ( Tung passed the Legislative Council Election Ordinance in 1998 to limit the eligible voters in functional constituencies to certain groups ; before that , all of the working people in Hong Kong had been entitled to vote in their respective functional constituencies . ) Now , only functional organizations , not individual employees , were counted as voting units . Furthermore , the Election Committee , which returned six members to the Legislative Council , was no longer composed of directly elected district board members but of indirectly elected members from various sectors . The selection of those sectors was highly controversial ; the electoral base was narrow and the election process indirect . Democracy at the local level was also reduced by scrapping the directly elected municipal councils that were responsible for regional environmental and hygiene matters . Those two functions are now centralized in newly created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district councils . ( Appointed seats had been abolished by Governor Patten in 1994 in an effort to develop truly representative local councils. ) ( n21 ) <p> The Tung administration has strongly insisted on running an executive-led government . Tung challenged the amended Rules of Procedures for the Legislative Council passed on 28 April 1999 . The amended Rules of Procedures give the president of the Legislative Council the power to rule on whether individual members ' bills relate to government policy . According to the Basic Law , individual members ' bills related to government policy need prior approval from the chief executive . Anson Chan , the chief secretary for administration , said that it was appropriate for the chief executive to make the ruling on whether such bills relate to government policy . Chan argued that " only those who formulate policies know whether bills relate to those policies . " ( n22 ) In addition , the administration believes that the Basic Law prohibits legislators ' amending bills that relate to public spending , the political structure , or government operation . However , the standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individual members ' bills , not to amendments. ( n23 ) The Tung administration further expanded the boundary of " government " to include the executive , the legislature , and the judiciary . Lee Cheuk-han of the Frontier Party commented that " the administration was seeking to expand its executive hegemony to the fullest extent . " ( n24 ) <p> The political strength of the democratic faction has also been deliberately weakened by the replacement of the majority representation electoral system with a proportional representation system in geographical constituencies . The Democratic Party seats gained from geographical constituencies were reduced from 12 in 1995 to 9 in 2000 . In contrast , the pro-Beijing DAB increased its directly elected seats from 2 in 1995 to 8 in 2000 . As a result , the total number of seats returned from geographical constituencies were distributed among all the political parties , decreasing the overall strength of the democratic faction and increasing that of the conservative pro-Beijing faction . The democrats were also excluded from Tung 's power center , including the Executive Council , the Commission on Strategic Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to government advisory committees and key policy bodies are heavily skewed toward the business-oriented Liberal Party. ( n25 ) It is therefore logical to believe that public policies in Hong Kong will be formulated predominantly according to business interests . Indeed , business always exerts pressure on the government , both publicly and privately , on the issue of democratization . Li Ka-shing , a very influential businessman , has said openly that he would reduce or even withdraw investment in Hong Kong if the political environment continued to be hostile . Coincidentally , Tung also questioned the performance and contribution of the Democratic Party to Hong Kong 's prosperity and stability . He said in the questioning session of the Legislative Council held on 7 October 1999 that the Democratic Party should prove its worth but that he had not seen any such demonstration. ( n26 ) As liberal politicians are marginalized , it is not hard to understand why some liberals , such as Christine Loh of the Citizens Party and Ronald Arculli of the Liberal Party , have lost their political enthusiasm and withdrawn from politics . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good caliber will certainly jeopardize further democratic development in Hong Kong . <p> Moreover , the development of a democratic political society is likely to be retarded by Tung 's conservative outlook on democratic development . Tung adheres closely to the timetable for political development laid down in the Basic Law , namely , that additional directly elected seats be introduced gradually in the Legislative Council until they constitute half of the council 's seats in the third term ( 2004-8 ) . In the second term ( 2000-4 ) , according to Tung , the chief executive will also be selected by an election committee . In a questioning session of the Legislative Council held on 13 January 2000 , Tung refused to discuss the possibility of political reforms before 2007 or to initiate amendment of the Basic Law with regard to political structures. ( n27 ) Tung 's response was a direct blow to the motion passed by the Legislative Council on the preceding day requesting that the government start consultation on the review of political structures . Tung also refused to consider introducing a ministerial system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet reached that stage . He reiterated the same message in his 2000 policy address , saying , " We need to allow for a period of gestation . We have ample time to go through this evolutionary process . " ( n28 ) <p> 3 . The Maintenance of the Rule of Law <p> A consolidated democracy must be embedded in and supported by the rule of law . In the words of Linz and Stepan , " all political actors must be held accountable to the rule of law .... animated by a spirit of constitutionalism as an indispensable condition . " ( n29 ) The essence of the constitutionalist spirit is strong consensus on the laws and a strong commitment to self-binding procedures of governance , whereby the government itself is subject to legal restraints and judicial review . A clear hierarchy of laws interpreted by an independent judiciary and supported by a strong legal culture among the people is therefore necessary . <p> The rule of law was established in Hong Kong before the hand-over . Hong Kong had always been ranked high among Asian countries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that achievement was duly recognized by the international community through various human rights reports submitted to the United Nations . Hong Kong had a complete common law system , supported by an independent judiciary , and a strong legal culture . The judicial system was , for the most part , free from executive control and political interference . The establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) in 1974 further strengthened the rule of law , making the Hong Kong government a clean and credible power holder . The spirit and practice of the rule of law are also safeguarded in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and in the Basic Law ( Article 8 ) , which decrees that " the laws previously in force in Hong Kong ( i.e. , the common law , rules of equity , ordinances , subordinate legislation , and customary law ) shall be maintained . " <p> However , various issues and incidents have put the principle of the rule of law in post-hand-over Hong Kong through severe tests . One controversial issue was the decision by the Department of Justice not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong Standard , although she had been named as a co-conspirator in a charge by ICAC on 17 March 1998 . Instead , three executives of the Hong Kong Standard were charged in connection with an alleged plot to inflate circulation figures . The ICAC statement alleged that " the executives conspired together with Sally Aw to defraud purchasers of advertising space in the Hong Kong Standard by various dishonest means . " ( n30 ) In responding to the question why Aw was not prosecuted , Daniel Fung , then solicitor general , said that " the interests of Hong Kong had to be considered in the decision whether to prosecute . " ( n31 ) Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung further explained that " the Sing Tao Group was facing financial difficulties and was restructuring with banks . If Sally Aw was prosecuted , it would be a serious obstacle for restructuring . If the group should collapse , its newspapers would be compelled to cease operation . " ( n32 ) Leung 's decision was backed by Tung , who held that " the decision to prosecute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n33 ) The public reaction was strong , and there were concerns about whether the rule of law had been violated . Martin Lee , the leader of the Democratic Party , commented that " two systems of justice ( one law for rich , one for poor ) are set up and such preferential treatment would undermine confidence in the rule of law . " ( n34 ) The Bar Council chair , Audrey Eu , said that " the decision had created public surprise . " ( n35 ) ( People speculated that Aw had escaped prosecution because of her status as a deputy of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference and her close connection with Tung . ) Margaret Ng , an independent legislator representing the legal functional constituency , tabled a motion of no-confidence in Elsie Leung in the Legislative Council on 10 March 1999 . Although the motion was defeated , it was the first such motion against a principal official. ( n36 ) <p> Another controversial challenge to the rule of law was the government 's decision in February 1998 not to prosecute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NCNA ) for violating the Personal Data ( Privacy ) Ordinance . Also in February 1998 , the privacy commissioner passed a file to the secretary for justice stating that the NCNA had refused Democrat activist Emily Lau access to her personal file within the legal deadline . The privacy commissioner , Steven Lau , said that the NCNA had " breached the provisions of the ordinance and that is an offence . " The NCNA was supposed to reply to Emily Lau within forty days but did not do so until ten months later ; it then reported that it had " no file on her . " ( n37 ) One academic described the government 's decision not to prosecute as " disturbing " because the NCNA should seek to be seen as abiding by the laws of Hong Kong. ( n38 ) A Department of Justice spokesperson said that " the decision was based on the established criteria of whether a prosecution was in the public interest . " ( n39 ) The decision of the secretary for justice was again backed by Tung , who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply rule under the local privacy laws was a technical breach , not a substantial breach , and therefore did not warrant court action . " ( n40 ) Subsequently , it was reported that the NCNA had sought legal advice on whether it could claim exemption from Hong Kong laws on the grounds that it had special status as an agency of the central government. ( n41 ) Some academics asserted that " the NCNA is not a consular mission . There is no question of consular immunity . " ( n42 ) <p> Tung 's invitation to the NPC to reinterpret the Basic Law and to overrule the decision by the Court of Final Appeal on the right of abode issue in June 1999 caused further concerns about the rule of law . In January 1999 , the Court of Final Appeal had awarded the right of abode to mainland children who were born before a parent became a permanent resident of the Hong Kong SAR and to illegitimate offspring . But Beijing officials declared in February that the decision had been a mistake and violated the Basic Law. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked by the Hong Kong government to clarify its ruling . The administration estimated that the number of abode claimants might reach 1.67 million and that social service spending triggered by the influx of immigrants would exceed HK$700 billion in ten years . Saying that the consequences were " unimaginable , " Tung decided on 18 May 1999 to seek the NPC 's reinterpretation of the right of abode provisions in the Basic Law. ( n44 ) Eventually , on 23 June 1999 , the NPC overruled the decision of the Court of Final Appeal . With the support of Hong Kong 's pro-Beijing political parties and legislators , amendments to the immigration laws based on the reinterpretation by the NPC were passed by the Legislative Council on 15 July 1999 . The outcome on the right of abode issue sent two messages : first , that a ruling made by the Court of Final Appeal may not be final ; and second , that Beijing had the right to participate in the internal affairs of the Hong Kong SAR . <p> These issues have led to the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been strengthened or weakened . In particular , one serious question is whether political considerations have overwhelmingly interfered with the judicial process , hence undermining judicial independence . To be fair to the SAR government , past records show that even before the hand-over , the Hong Kong government sometimes chose not to prosecute accused individuals . For instance , it did not prosecute Australian businessman Alan Bond for offenses under the Securities Ordinance in 1987 . And in April 1997 it did not prosecute China Legal Services ( Hong Kong ) for failing to register under the Legal Practitioners Ordinance . Nevertheless , in the sensitive period immediately after the hand-over , the international and local communities were highly concerned about whether such legal values as the rule of law and judicial independence could be maintained under Chinese sovereignty . The judicial system may have been maintained for the most part , but the new political context after the hand-over has caused legal practitioners , especially those working in the SAR government , to become politically confused . Under the new system , in a sensitive political context , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless Beijing officials give strong and clear indications to the SAR government that Hong Kong must strive for the rule of law irrespective of the alleged charge and person , judicial independence and justice will be threatened . <p> 4 . The Establishment of a Usable Bureaucracy <p> A democratic government needs to be able to protect citizens ' rights and to deliver basic services that citizens demand ; it therefore needs the capacity to command and to regulate . A modern democracy needs a functioning state with a bureaucracy that is usable by political leaders . A usable bureaucracy in the ideal sense is technically competent , politically neutral , hierarchically disciplined , professionally committed , economically cost-effective , and administratively efficient. ( n45 ) <p> Hong Kong has a well-established bureaucracy . The administration in Hong Kong is a centralized structure composed mainly of the chief executive , policy bureaus , and executive departments . Civil servants are recruited on the basis of a merit system , based on open and competitive recruitment processes . Civil servants in Hong Kong are trained to be competent , neutral , disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large extent they demonstrate those characteristics . Yet in an executive-led political framework in which senior civil servants hold most of the decision-making and political powers , the Hong Kong bureaucracy also demonstrates some less positive traits . One observer has found that Hong Kong civil servants exhibited " complacency , defensiveness , formalism , inflexibility , and technicalism. " ( n46 ) Hong Kong civil servants have been described as " introverted , technocratic , conservative , apolitical , and amoral. " ( n47 ) <p> The stable and dominant civil service began to face political challenges when elected legislators emerged after the development of representative government in 1985 . It was also confronted with the implementation of public sector reform in 1989 . Those two political and administrative reforms weakened the capabilities of the civil service and hence its usability . <p> The development of quasi-representative government and the consequent emergence of elected politicians transformed politics in Hong Kong from a consultative to an adversarial style . The previous system of consultation and administrative co-option of elites was gradually destroyed by the adversarial politics of confrontation and party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been trained to be statesmen , monopolizing the political power of the government , they found it difficult to adjust to a new political environment in which they had to accommodate elected legislators who were harshly critical and even hostile . The morale of civil servants has been seriously undermined by continuous bombardment from elected legislators . The reason for many conflicts between civil servants and elected politicians is that civil servants govern without a popular base , whereas the elected legislators have a popular base without power to govern . The two types of political actors compete for power and distrust each other . The civil servants remain politically dominant , but they are seriously challenged by elected politicians who question the legitimacy of their rule . Such a hostile and competitive environment is not conducive to the effective functioning of a bureaucracy . <p> The public sector reform , aimed at increasing the productivity and efficiency of the administration , has encountered problems that also reduce the usability of the Hong Kong civil service . The first problem is the absence of a coherent strategy for overall governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more decisions and to manage departmental budgets . Because of the lack of coordination , the various departments , units , and agencies produce programs and plans that are redundant , inconsistent , or contradictory . The new airport opening fiasco and the bird flu crisis are cases in point. ( n48 ) What is missing in the New Public Management ( NPM ) framework in Hong Kong is an emphasis on cross-functional and cross-departmental coordination . <p> The second problem in the public sector reform is neglect of dominant social values . The NPM heavily emphasizes economic and business considerations such as cost recovery , user pay , value for money , privatization , savings through the use of contractors , and profit maximization in the provision of public services . Yet the social and political values of justice , fairness , equality , liberty , and freedom are ignored by the NPM . In times of economic prosperity , public sentiment against the use of business practices in social services may not be visible . But Hong Kong has entered a period of economic depression , and most citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Social problems are aggravated and become more difficult for civil servants to solve . <p> The third problem is that democratic structures are inadequate to hold departmental managers and semigovernmental bodies responsible , let alone private companies involved in privatization programs . Managers have more autonomy and power in making decisions and managing finance , but are not held accountable as in the past . <p> The fourth problem is the loss of stability in the civil service through reforms such as the replacement of pensionable employment with contracts ; linkage of pay raises with performance ; compulsory early retirement ; emphasis on productivity gains ; and internal competition . The decline of unity , vision , accountability , and stability in the bureaucracy has diminished its usability. ( n49 ) Conclusions <p> According to Stepan and Linz , a democratic regime is consolidated when it satisfies three requirements : Behavioral : No political actors attempt to achieve their objectives by creating a nondemocratic regime . Attitudinal : A strong majority of the public believes that democratic procedures and institutions are the most appropriate way to govern . Constitutional : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the bounds of law. ( n50 ) <p> The preceding analysis does not suggest that these three requirements are well satisfied in post-hand-over Hong Kong . First , behavior : Tung , the pro-Beijing political parties ( the DAB and the HKPA ) , the conservative business-oriented Liberal Party , and the Beijing leaders all collaborate to maintain a nondemocratic regime . They form a powerful political coalition that attempts to slow the pace of democratization as much as possible and even to reverse the process . Second , attitude : The majority of Hong Kong citizens do not actively translate their democratic belief into political participation . Hong Kong citizens remain too pragmatic and rational ; democratic procedures and institutions are not regarded as absolutely necessary . Third , the constitution : There are concerns , supported by evidence , that the rule of law has been undermined or challenged since reunification . Consequently , democratic consolidation in Hong Kong has been weak under Chinese sovereignty . The process of democratic consolidation in Hong Kong will be smoother if the top political leadership ( namely the chief executive ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms . <p> These conclusions on the consolidation of and prospects for democracy are based primarily on the analyses of Hong Kong 's internal political and social conditions . Those internal conditions , however , are largely affected by the external political environment . The Beijing government inevitably is the most influential external factor . It possesses the greatest power resources in Hong Kong ; the question is simply whether Beijing will exercise its power to the fullest extent . Beijing has absolute constitutional control over Hong Kong through its power to interpret the Basic Law and to veto a law passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council . It also has great economic power based on China 's massive investment in Hong Kong . And Beijing enjoys strong political support from its loyal DAB and HKPA and from the business sector , not to mention the People 's Liberation Army in Hong Kong . Thus Beijing is the dominant influence in Hong Kong 's politics in general and in its democratic development in particular . <p> The current Beijing leadership is still afraid that Hong Kong could become a base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trauma of " peaceful evolution " is still strong for the Beijing leaders. ( n51 ) Thus Beijing 's strategy toward Hong Kong is basically to prevent peaceful evolution and to keep Hong Kong under total political control . In the future , if the Beijing leaders feel more secure in their political system and adopt a more liberal style of leadership , they will relax their political control and allow a faster pace of democratization in Hong Kong . They would of course hope to present Hong Kong as a successful model to Taiwan to promote reunification . Beijing 's need to persuade the people of Taiwan to accept reunification became urgent after the Democratic Progressive Party won the presidential election in Taiwan . Consequently , changes in China 's political leadership are the ultimate influence on the development of democracy in Hong Kong . <p>
