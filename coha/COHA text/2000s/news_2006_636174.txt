<p> High heating costs have combined with a desperate need for affordable housing to drive a new concept in Chicago home building  --  precast concrete . <p> A Naperville company has pioneered an ecologically friendly way to make the precast concrete , which is 50 percent stronger than conventional concrete and 30 to 50 percent more energy efficient than federal standards require . <p> The precast concrete also blocks noise , can protect against destructive tornado-strength winds , and is more fire-resistant than conventional building materials . The resulting walls are finished on both sides , and the floors already have the tubing installed for hookup to radiant heat systems . <p> The speedy manufacturing process and the ability to install the panels by crane shave 25 to 30 percent off of a project 's building cycle timetable , said Brian Bock , vice president of sales and marketing for Dukane Precast Inc. , the Naperville company whose leaders toured Europe to learn the basics of the innovative precast technique . <p> The precast concrete is also proving an easy way for developers to incorporate parking garages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park on the street or in an outside lot . <p> Clifton F. Crawford , president of Crawford Development Partners of Evanston , is using the precast concrete in a 28-unit condo development he 's building in the Woodlawn community on Chicago 's South Side . <p> Crawford , who describes his mission as developing " quality , affordable , energy-efficient contemporary housing " on the South Side , was won over by the competitive advantages he enjoys by using precast concrete . <p> " We 're able to erect a six-flat of 10,000 square feet in a week or so , depending on the weather , " said Crawford , who left a 20-year career as a Fortune 100 sales and marketing executive to build affordable housing . <p> " The speed at which we can build gives us a competitive advantage because we have lower carrying costs or interest expense , " he said . <p> Crawford also touts the material 's energy efficiency and the highly finished look , which makes precast concrete difficult to discern from dry-wall . <p> " Our interior/exterior walls come finished , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the factory insulated , we do n't have to stud insulate , wallboard , tape , mud or sand . This provides a significant savings in time and money . " <p> " Last year , we had a model unit on the third floor . It stayed between 64 and 68 degrees , and we never turned on the heat , " Crawford said , noting that concrete is a heat conductor . <p> " In the summer , we had a model on the first floor and it stayed between 72 and 76 degrees . We only turned on the air conditioner to reduce humidity . " <p> The precast concrete also has n't interfered with Crawford 's goal of making the condos stylish . He has installed hardwood floors , a stone fireplace in the great room and sleek , contemporary fixtures . <p> Crawford has sold seven of the Woodlawn building 's 16 units .

The most prevalent system uses hollow , polystyrene blocks that stack and interlock . Concrete is pumped into the cavity to create a sold structure wall with insulation on both sides . <p> PRECAST CONCRETE FORMS <p> With precast technology , large sections ( or panels ) of concrete walls are poured horizontally in a carefully controlled factory environment . The sections typically arrive by truck , are lifted into place , and fastened together . Typically , a layer of foam insulation is incorporated within the wall at the factory , greatly enhancing energy efficiency . " It can take literally four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niehoff said . <p> CONCRETE MASONRY <p> This time-proven technique continues to produce durable and , increasingly , sustainable structures , especially when integrating a layer of insulation . For construction , masons lay a series of courses ( or rows ) of concrete block bound with mortar . The block walls are often reinforced with concrete pumped into the cavity . <p> Removable Concrete Forms <p> The granddaddy of concrete forming has moved up from the basement foundation and into the market for above-grade walls . With this system , a crew erects forms that make a mold in the shape of the desired walls . Once steel rebar is placed within , the concrete is poured into the cavity . Crews then strip the forms to leave a concrete wall . In some cases , companies design form liners so the home already has a decorative finish , therefore saving time and eliminating the waste generated by cladding the home . Again , a layer of foam insulations is the secret to maximizing concrete 's thermal mass properties . Color Photo : Keith Hale/Sun-Times ; Clifton F.
