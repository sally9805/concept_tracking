Green salt is n't something you 'd want to sprinkle on French fries . It 's what nuclear chemists call uranium tetrafluoride , a grainy substance that can be used to make fuel for a nuclear reactor or fissile material for a bomb . In short , it 's scary stuff , which is why the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) confronted Iran late last month about a secret Iranian research effort called the Green Salt Project . Iran has long maintained that it wants to enrich uranium to generate nuclear power , not to make a bomb . But disclosure of the project  --  and its apparent links to the testing of high explosives  --  seems to have been just what Washington and its allies needed to send Iran to the U.N . Security Council for possible sanctions , a measure the IAEA 's board of 35 member nations approved last week in a 27-to-3 vote , with five abstentions . <P> What happens next ? A formal IAEA report on Iran 's nuclear program , due March 6 , is expected to conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would pressure the Security Council to take meaningful steps when it addresses the matter next month . Tehran now has a few weeks to disclose all aspects of its nuclear program , but it has already denied IAEA requests to review documents and interview sources , and said after Saturday 's vote that it would further curtail the nuclear watchdog 's inspection powers . <P> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice helped firm up support for the IAEA vote by having aides brief foreign officials on a trove of documents that , according to U.S. diplomatic sources , expose a clandestine Iranian military nuclear-research operation . The documents , found in 2004 on a laptop computer , which U.S. intelligence believes came from an Iranian engineer , contain data on tests for high explosives , a design for a missile re-entry vehicle and a diagram of a green-salt production line . Separately , those areas of research could imply fairly benign intentions . But if an Iranian military agency has been coordinating all the research , the U.S. assessment is " you 're talking about a nuclear-tipped missile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Even Russia and China , with economic ties to Tehran , now seem convinced that it may all add up to a nuclear-weapons program . Rice won those countries ' support at a dinner in London last week , hosted by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw . " She made the argument , " says U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns , " that we all have an interest in not introducing another nuclear power into the Mideast . "
