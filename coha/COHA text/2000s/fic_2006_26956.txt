May 1958 Gone Laura watched the thunderstorm from the living room window . The clouds bloated and darkened , common in the Panhandle during late afternoons , and then it poured  --  a gusty , whipsaw wind driving the rain sideways against the house . The rain hardened into thick white hail , which soon sheeted the yard . Her younger brothers , Gene and Rich , joined her at the window , and their mother stopped cooking in the kitchen and stood behind them , drying her hands on a dish towel . The boys soon tired of the show , but Laura and her mother continued to stare at the white pellets pouring down  --  dumped , it seemed , from a huge bucket in the clouds . Lightning crinkled the gray sky , and to gauge the distance , Laura counted slowly until she heard the thunder . One , two , three , four , BOOM ! The time between the light and the sound shortened , and then in an instant the hail stopped , the sky opened up , and a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moment later , simultaneous thunder and a flash of silver heat cracked in their yard . The house shook as if bulldozed . Rich screamed . Laura was blinded for a few seconds . Her body vibrated , jangled , and her teeth kept clicking , as if she were sending asignal in code . Her mother stood in front of the window , frozen , her face cut by the sudden shadows after the light . Gene led Laura to the couch . " Are you okay ? " he asked . " The . . . the tree , " Laura stuttered , " the tree . " Her mother opened the door and went outside . The old oak was split in half , a bright black burn down the center , the heavy-leaved top branches strewn across the white-pelleted lawn and porch . The ends touched the door . " My God , " Mrs. Tate said , shuffling through the melting hail . She placed her hands on the dark center of the trunk . " It 's hot , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , the muscles in her thighs and calves quivering , the joints of her knees still vibrating . Her teeth would n't stop clicking . Small lines of blinking silver crosshatched her vision . The sky darkened again . She and her brothers stood on the porch , afraid to move into the yard . Their mother touched the trunk , the branches , the leaves , as if searching for a heartbeat . " So hot , " she muttered , " so hot . " The next morning , the destroyed oak lay about the yard like a huge , stricken animal . Mr. Tate and Laura 's older brother , Manny , had cleared away some of the debris that night , but the large job of cutting the heavy branches and uprooting the burned base of the trunk would take longer and would require special equipment . Leaving for school , they had to maneuver carefully around the fallen branches and the blackened husk of the split trunk . It was a mess . Coming home on her bicycle later , Laura rounded the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her body . Faint silver lines again blurred her vision . Her teeth involuntarily clicked . All this triggered , miraculously , by the presence of the tree . She got off her bike in the front yard and wheeled it around to the side of the house . The front door was slightly ajar , and she pushed it open . " I 'm home . " No one answered . " Momma ? Rich ? " Still no answer , which made her nervous . She went through the kitchen and opened the kitchen door , expecting them to be in the backyard . But all she saw was Fay , scratching around the fences . " Where 's everybody ? " she called . Fay trotted over . Laura patted the old dog 's coat and head , careful around the wounds that their younger dog , Greta , had gouged in her face . Fay licked Laura 's wrists and cheek with her bad breath . Inside , on the kitchen table , Laura found the note , quickly scrawled , in her mother 's crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where did my mother go ? " Laura asked old Mrs. Ambling . " I was wondering the same thing . She just asked me if I would watch Rich until all of you kids got home . She seemed in a hurry . She headed down the road with a suitcase . " " A suitcase ? " " Yes , a brown one . Not that big . " Laura inhaled sharply . She knew the suitcase , could picture it clearly in the back of her mother 's closet , rarely used . It had a hole in the bottom , patched with duct tape , and one of the grips was frayed and threatening to come loose . Laura thanked Mrs. Ambling and grabbed Rich 's hand . " Ouch ! " he whined as they walked across the yard to their house . " You 're squeezing too hard . " " Sorry .

Maybe something 's happened to Aunt Velma , Laura thought . Maybe she went to Amarillo . She sat on her parents ' bed and closed her eyes for a few moments . She could smell her mother 's presence in the room  --  a faint whiff of sweat and talcum powder . The front door opened . It was Manny . He came to the bedroom , an apple from Mrs. Ambling 's front yard in hand , a greased black curl falling over his forehead . " You ai n't supposed to be in here . " He smirked , leaning against the doorjamb . He does n't know either , she thought . " Where 's Momma ? " he said , chomping the apple . " I do n't know .

Give it to him , Laura . "
