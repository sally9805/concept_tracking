Wall Street has a way of taking a good thing and misusing it . Consider stock buybacks . For decades they were a comforting , surefire sign of management confidence . After the crash in 1987 , hundreds of companies initiated plans to spend billions on their own dirt-cheap shares . That inspired investors to do the same and helped stanch the panic  --  a good thing . Today , though , buybacks can be more about funding management 's stock options than about signaling its resolve . <P> Yes , plenty of companies still buy back shares for the right reasons . Deflated by the Firestone flap , Ford has increased and expedited a huge buyback unveiled last spring . The company plainly believes its woes are overblown , and many analysts agree . The stock is down 17% in two months and looks like a screaming bargain to some . I 'm not so sure , given the bad publicity the Ford Explorer is getting . <P> Other companies announcing old-fashioned buybacks in the face of slumping shares include Sears and Nokia . And still others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sound from a tax view . Dividends are taxed as income ; buybacks tend to lift a stock , which generates capital gains normally taxed at a lower rate . <P> Yet buybacks are increasingly concocted to offset the potential dilution of mega-stock-option grants , which exploded in number in the ' 90s . The strategy is especially prevalent among tech companies , including Dell , Adobe and Autodesk . But others , including Citigroup and Chiron , do it too . The idea is to buy back enough stock so that when executives and employees exercise options , the company can deliver the stock without printing more of it . <P> In a perfect match  --  say 100 million options exercised and 100 million shares repurchased  --  the all-important net effect on earnings per share is nil . But investors generally do n't appreciate that . They see a huge stock buyback and assume it 's positive because buybacks have traditionally reduced the number of shares outstanding , and that increased earnings per share and made each share more valuable . <P> Making matters worse , a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to invest in other opportunities and , increasingly , leveraging up to the point where their debt becomes riskier to the institutions that buy it . More risk requires more reward . So borrowing costs rise . This year Moody 's has lowered the debt rating of 29 companies at least partly because of costly new buyback programs . All last year , there were just eight buyback-related downgrades . <P> Moreover , " about half of the high techs end up repurchasing stock near their highs , " says Bob Gabele , who tracks stock-option activity for Thomson Financial Securities . That 's hardly a wise use of cash . But companies fall into the trap because they 've been doling out so many options for so long . They must buy back shares whatever the price  --  or issue more shares . <P> What does this mean to you ? Not all buybacks are bullish . Look for one that takes place when the stock is depressed and the buyback is funded out of operations , asset sales or reserves . Ongoing buybacks can be good , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely offsets dilution from options should be dismissed as meaningless , possibly even harmful  --  unless you 're the one with the stock options .
