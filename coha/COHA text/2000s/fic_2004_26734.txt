Summer . Season of long , slow days and short , hot nights . Back in Brooklyn , where I spent my first fifteen of them , summer  --  when it had n't meant camp  --  had meant hanging out on the stoop with my best friend , Gina , and her brothers , waiting for the ice-cream truck to come by . When it was n't too hot , we played a game called War , dividing into teams with the other kids in the neighborhood and shooting each other with imaginary guns . When we got older , of course , we quit playing War . Gina and I also started laying off the ice cream . Not that it mattered . None of the neighborhood guys , the ones we used to play with , wanted anything to do with us . Well , with me , anyway . I do n't think they 'd have minded renewing acquaintances with Gina , but by the time they finally noticed what a babe she 'd grown into , she 'd set her sights way higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I expected from my sixteenth summer , my first since moving to California to live with my mom and her new husband . . . and , oh , yeah , his sons . I guess I envisioned the same long , slow days . Only these , in my mind , would be spent at the beach rather than on an apartment building 's front stoop . And as for those short , hot nights , well , I had plans for those , as well . All I needed was a boyfriend . But as it happened , neither the beach nor the boyfriendmaterialized , the latter because the guy I liked ? Yeah , he so was n't interested . At least , as far as I could tell . And the former because . . . Well , because I was forced to get a job . That 's right : A job . I was horrified when one night at dinner , around the beginning of May , my stepfather , Andy , asked me if I 'd put in any summer employment applications anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? " But it soon became clear that , like the many other sacrifices I 'd been asked to make since my mother met , fell in love with , and married Andy Ackerman  --  host of a popular cable television home improvement program , native Californian , and father of three  --  my long hot summer lazing at the beach with my friends was not to be . In the Ackerman household , it soon unfolded , you had two alternatives for how you spent your summer break : a job , or remedial tutoring . Only Doc , my youngest stepbrother  --  known as David to everyone but me  --  was exempt from either of these , as he was too young to work , and he had made good enough grades that he 'd been accepted into a month-long computer camp , at which he was presumably learning skills that would make him the next Bill Gates  --  only hopefully without the bad haircut and Wal-Mart-y sweaters . My second-youngest stepbrother , Dopey ( also known as Brad ) was not so lucky . Dopey had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my opinion , English being his native language  --  and so was being forced by his father to attend summer school five days a week . . . . when he was n't being used as unpaid slave labor on the project Andy had undertaken while his TV show was on summer hiatus : tearing down a large portion of our house 's backyard deck and installing a hot tub . Given the alternatives  --  employment or summer school  --  I chose to seek employment . I got a job at the same place my oldest stepbrother , Sleepy , works every summer . He , in fact , recommended me , an act which , at the time , simultaneously stunned and touched me . It was n't until later that I found out that he had received a small bonus for every person he recommended who was later hired . Whatever . What it actually boils down to is this : Sleepy  --  Jake , as he is known to his friends and the rest of the family  --  and I are now proud employees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeguard at one of the resort 's many pools , and me as . . . Well , I signed away my summer to become a hotel staff babysitter . Okay . You can stop laughing now . Even I will admit that it 's not the kind of job I ever thought I 'd be suited for , since I am not long on patience and am certainly not overly fond of having my hair spat up in . But allow me to point out that it does pay ten dollars an hour , and that that does not include tips . And let me just say that the people who stay at the Pebble Beach Hotel and Golf Resort ? Yeah , they are the kind of people who tend to tip . Generously . The money , I must say , has gone a long way toward healing my wounded pride . If I have to spend my summer in mindless drudgery , earning a hundred bucks a day  --  and frequently more  --  amply compensates for it . Because by the time the summer is over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall wardrobe of anyone entering the junior class of the Junipero Serra Mission Academy . So think about that , Kelly Prescott , while you spend your summer lounging by your father 's pool . I 've already got four pairs of Jimmy Choos , paid for with my own money . What do you think about that , Little Miss Daddy 's AmEx ? The only real problem with my summer job  --  besides the whiny children and their equally whiny , but loaded , parents , of course  --  is the fact that I am expected to report there at 8:00 in the morning every day . That 's right . 8:00 a.m . No sleeping in for old Suze this summer . I must say I find this a bit excessive . And believe me , I 've complained . And yet the management staff at the Pebble Beach Hotel and Golf Resort have remained stubbornly unswayed by my persuasive arguments for refraining from offering babysitting services until nine . And so it is that every morning ( I ca n't even sleep in on Sundays , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the dining table for the elaborate brunch he prepares ; he seems to think we are the Camdens or the Waltons something ) I am up before seven . . . .
