" Obama 's piece failed to describe the complete historical context of the document . Lincoln 's ability to end slavery was restricted by the limits of his constitutional power . As Commander in Chief , Lincoln had certain war powers that enabled him to free slaves in territories that had seceded from the Union at the time of the Proclamation . Slavery throughout the U.S. , however , could be abolished only by a constitutional amendment  --  the 13th , which was ratified by the states in 1865 . The proclamation clearly had certain powerful and advantageous political implications , especially overseas . We must , however , acknowledge the enormous risks Lincoln took in issuing it . We need only examine the anxious reaction of his contemporaries to gauge how politically risky a move it was . <P> ROBERT CARTER <P> Short Hills , N.J.               @ @ @ @ @ @
