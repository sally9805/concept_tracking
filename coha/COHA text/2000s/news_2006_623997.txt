<p> Morihiro Hosokawa blazed across Japan 's political firmament like a comet . <p> The charismatic descendant of famous feudal lords , he led the reformist overthrow of a 38-year monopoly on government held by the conservative elite to become Japan 's prime minister in 1993 . <p> Comparisons were made in the American media to John F. Kennedy , but Japan 's Camelot proved short-lived . After eight months , Hosokawa resigned in the face of criticism about questionable campaign contributions and left politics . <p> Now , Hosokawa 's back in the limelight , somewhat reluctantly . He retreated into what he hoped would be the simple life of a rural potter , but his traditional-style tea bowls have brought the world knocking again . <p> " I 'm not a professional potter , and I did n't intend to become a professional potter , " the gentle-mannered Hosokawa said in an interview Friday in San Francisco . <p> He 's here to deliver a speech this afternoon at the Asian Art Museum , his first talk in the United States on his reincarnation into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire . <p> Commanding prices in the $6,000 to $10,000 range , his work is valued not just for the fame of its maker but also its quality , experts say . <p> " His work is gaining renown , " said Emily Sano , director of the museum . " These are works of art aligned to Japanese tea ceremony esthetics . This is regarded as a very high art in Japan . " <p> Many people have asked Hosokawa why at age 60 in 1998 he abandoned a three-decade career in politics  --  which also included a seat in Japan 's parliament and the governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture  --  to make tea bowls . <p> " There 's a phrase in classical Chinese and old Japanese , seikou udoku , which means when the sun is shining , till the fields , and when it is raining , engage in reading , " Hosokawa said through an interpreter . " I was attracted to this type of life from my youth . " <p> He said he watches little television and no longer reads newspapers , preferring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic life , including the pastoral poetry of William Wordsworth and especially the work of great Chinese poets like Tao Yuan Ming and Li Bo . <p> He declines invitations to the prime minister 's residence , the Imperial Palace and receptions with visiting leaders like President Bush . He also prefers to turn down requests for interviews and appearances . <p> Hosokawa said he agreed to speak in San Francisco because he appreciates " the heritage of good works in U.S.-Japan relations " by the Japan Society of Northern California , which invited him  --  and because his wife , Kayoko Hosokawa , planned to conduct a program on the Special Olympics on Saturday in San Francisco . <p> He said he came to speak about " the Japanese spirit , " but politics continues to loom large in his reputation . <p> Analysts say his short time in office had a long-lasting impact . <p> " The real reformist legacy of his period was the reform of the electoral system , " said T.J. Pempel , a Japan politics expert who heads the Institute of East Asian Studies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 when Japan adopted a new system in which citizens cast votes for individual candidates for some seats in the national legislature and votes for the parties that will fill the remaining seats . <p> Hosokawa 's grasp on power was tenuous , though , because his administration was a coalition of eight parties , aligned against the long-entrenched and powerful Liberal Democratic Party . <p> " Good looks and charm can only go so far in herding cats , " Pempel said . <p> Hosokawa took up the quiet life about 60 miles from Tokyo in the hot-springs resort town of Yugawara , where he makes his pottery in five kilns , reads , gardens , goes fishing and hosts guests in traditional tea ceremonies . <p> " The idea of taking oneself out of the world of power and influence , " Asian Art Museum director Sano said , " has a long tradition that began in China and spread to Japan . " <p> It 's a lifestyle not much in vogue today , however . <p> " I think it would be rare in any country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no tie over cream-colored shirt and black pants . <p> Hosokawa 's family heritage was steeped in the tea tradition , but he did n't consider making tea implements himself until he attended a friend 's ceramics exhibit in 1998 . <p> " My family has been among the warrior class in Japan for close to 700 years , and many of them were very much involved in the tea ceremony , " he said . " Some of them were very close to Sen no Rikyu , the founder of the tea esthetic and tea life , and they were adherents of the master . And so there are many tea bowls of value in my family 's collection . " <p> Parts of that collection are housed with other family treasures in a special Tokyo museum called Eisei Bunko on a former Hosokawa family estate . The family descends from generations of Hosokawa daimyo , the cultured samurai-literati who served as domain lords of Kumamoto under the ruling shogun . In modern times , his grandfather was a prime minister of Japan during World War II . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humility . He apprenticed himself for one and a half years , training from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. , under the demanding eyes of a master potter named Shiro Tsujimura , whom Hosokawa called " sort of a wild man . " <p> " He did not care for status or fame , " Hosokawa said . " The fact that he was dealing with a former prime minister meant nothing to him . I was even 10 years or so older than he was . <p> " But he would tell me things like , ' Oh , you 're an idiot ! You 're not doing it right ! You 've got to destroy it and continue working hard . ' I was really trained that way from morning ' til night . And it was thanks to him I think that I learned the craft and became adept at the craft . " <p> His training and hard work seem to be paying off . Koichi Yanagi , who runs a New York fine arts gallery , is planning an exhibition of Hosokawa 's work next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who bought a 28-inch-tall jar for $10,000 . Yanagi saidHosokawa 's work is selling well in Japan in part because of his name recognition but also because it is " really well-done , even though he only started in the past six or seven years . " <p> Robert Yellin , a Japan-based columnist and author on Japanese ceramics , said Hosokawa works in many styles and excels particularly in the highly regarded raku type of tea bowls , which are thick and colored red or black . <p> Raku , like other traditional Japanese styles , appear rustic or imperfect , a trait that lures Hosokawa to the craft as a means of exploring his Japanese identity . <p> " Japanese ceramics are different from Chinese or Korean or European or American ceramics , " he said . " Non-Japanese ceramics , for example , are exactly circular or very symmetrical . Japanese ceramics are valued for their slight deformity . " <p> The Japanese reverence for refined simplicity , closeness to nature and incompleteness can be seen also in Japanese gardens , or in the preference for flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially hidden by clouds , he said . Such a suggestiveness offers fertile ground for cultivating the imagination . <p> Behind Hosokawa 's passion for his new life is a desire to restore " the fine qualities of the wonderful Japanese spirit that is all but lost in Japan now . It is rapidly leaving us . <p> " In the past in Japan , and in America and other countries , people really adhered to having a noble spirit and simple life . That existed I think through my father 's generation . " <p> But it is lacking in today 's materialist , consumer society , he said . He blamed the current system of education , family upbringing and particularly " the negative impact of Japanese television . " <p> " There are those like myself who are working hard and have a really strong hope that we can somehow bring back that kind of spirit , " he said . <p> Hosokawa will speak at 2:30 today at the Asian Art Museum , 200 Larkin St. , San Francisco . General admission is $30 . Morihiro Hosokawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . Experts praise the quality of his work . / Darryl Bush / The Chronicle
