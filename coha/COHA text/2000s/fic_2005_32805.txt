Chapter One : Prophecy Rain . Gouging thin canals through soiled windowpanes . Night . Bending from black to phosphorescent green . A sickening hue , like alien pus . Liquid all around me . But not drowning . Neon hummed beyond the glass . Twisted tubes . Huge letters spelling out a single word etched in blue-white light : prophecy . The word seemed apocalyptic . No . That is n't right . It was part of the apocalypse . Some drunken bum down the hall had clued him in . " The apocalypse is coming "  --  that 's what the geezer said . " When all the secrets will be exposed . " No more secrets , no more running . " Hell is comin ' ... " That 's what he said . He spit when he said it , too . Then the old guy just stopped breathing . Air . No air here . But breathing still . It happened a lot at the Prophecy . Old guys . And not so old . Keeling over . Dropping dead . Trapped inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not yet ... The water from the sky was as old as the earth . Logan watched it fall . The same water . Billions of years . Over and over . Fish crawled out of it . Man crawled out of it , too . Then I crawled out . Trapped inside . Liquid all aroud . A vile chemical . But not water ... Dinosaurs fed on plants , drank from lakes . This rain was part of those lakes . The wells of villages . Warriors , barbarians , samurai . The water they drank went up and came down . The same water . Trapped in a cycle . Everything , even the earth , has its limits . A shock of lightning scratched the night . Logan 's eyes shined through the glass  --  feral-sharp , scanning streets lit by shards of bone-white brilliance . Another strike , a tree split . The energy sundered it . Like a warning of things to come . " Storm 's comin ' , and it 's a big one . The big one . The one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered the road . The cold steered the wheel . Black woods at night . The far north . Endless wilderness . Soon he 'd be back . Soon he 'd be home . Beyond the glass now : wet concrete , rusty Dumpsters , graffiti-scarred alleys , haunting tenements , emptiness . They have n't found me . Not yet . Logan turned from the window , crossed the stained brown carpet . The room was as small as a cage , empty bottles like stalagmites spiking the floor , spiking his brain . A week-old newspaper ripped under his booted foot , meaningless events . Day after day . He collapsed on a couch , spring-cushioned by a tabloid spread over it . His massive fist tightened , crumpling the newsprint , hurling the ink-black words at the blank TV . Useless headlines . Day after day after day . Nearby , a Seagram 's bottle , shimmering with many promises . Half-empty . No . Half-full . He poured a healthy swallow into a glass , always grateful . Ripples of electricity scratched the night . Searing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retching as a salty trickle rolled down his throat . Then the pain vanished , leaving only the coppery taste of blood  --  a familiar tang . He touched his throbbing temple , but found no stain . Only beads of salty sweat moistened his fingertips . He swallowed again , and the metallic sting was gone , too . Were his senses off ? Or was the alcohol awakening demons of past mayhem , forgotten violence ? Forgotten ... " The apocalypse is here . Time to write home , to make peace with somebody  --  " Peace ? With whom ? He remembered the saloon , a dozen milling bodies . The usual fog of burning tar . The air had felt frozen . But his muscles , beneath the flannel , had been warm enough . He 'd lined up the bottles on the bar in front of him , green pickets . Glass pillars . His fortress . Time to write home . " Dear Ma  --  ya goat-headed , misshapen , walleyed witch . Got some news for ya . The secret is out ! Signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he knew who his mother was . Everybody 's got one , right ? Or two , maybe . Secrets , that is . Logan had a doozy . A serious mother lode . Hard hiding it sometimes . But he got by . Another shot of whisky straight from the bottle . But no oblivion . Not even a rush , until he noted its absence . Then the sensation arrived as if he 'd conjured it . He sucked his cigar . Gagging . Tissue rips . A ravaged throat . Maybe the apocalypse has already begun . This place where he was hiding , this Prophecy , it was a tenement transformed by the faithful into a refuge for fallen Christians . He 'd been a Christian once , a long time ago . He still remembered enough of the lingo to lie his way through the door . It was a dump , of course . But it was free  --  for the fallen . So he 'd qualified . Warm whisky dribbled past Logan 's wiry , raven-black chin stubble , onto his sweat-stained T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough of the stuff to stun an elephant ... " Alcohol alters the flow of electrolyte ions through brain cells . He remembered reading that somewhere  --  part of his black ops training , maybe . Whisky slows the speed at which neurons fire . " But I 'm not drunk . And I want to be ... I need to be ... " Alcohol suppresses the production of a hormone that keeps the body 's fluid reserves in balance . Without that hormone , kidneys begin to steal water from other organs ... " Steal water ? " The storm continued to rage , intensifying . The rain continued to pound on the windows . Liquid all around . But not drowning . The brain shrinks as a result . Logan snatched the bottle again and spilled the dregs into the bottom of his glass . But he paused before shooting it back . Cradling the drink in his heavy fist , Logan slumped into the battered couch . Violent images flowed over him . A dispute he 'd had with a nickel-and-dime crime boss . The idiotic bravado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It happened after he 'd become an outcast again . This time he 'd been booted from a secret branch of the Canadian Intelligence Service . The infraction had been trivial compared to the heinous acts he 'd performed in the line of duty . But Logan sensed his peers were happy to rid themselves of the enigma in their midst . Secrets . I had plenty . More than any man should bear . Not long after , Logan found work . His reputation became a two-edged sword . An unending line of young punks or fading old-timers always there to challenge him . But that meant jobs were easy to come by . This time around , it had been Logan 's " associates " who 'd executed the double cross . That day , Logan recalled , had gotten off to a bad start . He resented the trip to the gunrunner 's garage to collect his cut of the profits . But when he saw the sneer on St. Exeter 's face , Logan knew things were about to get much worse . The gunrunner leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prada pants , and Gucci loafers incongruous in the junkyard setting . " I did n't think you 'd have the guts to show up here , Logan . Not after your connection failed to deliver the goods . " St. Exeter pushed back his hair with a delicate , manicured hand . Logan met the man 's cool gaze . " You 're spewing crap , Rene . I know for a fact that those air-to-airs are already in the pipeline to your ' clients ' in Latin America . " " Perhaps . But the weapons were of ... inferior quality . " " The Pentagon would be surprised to learn that , considering they were all state-of-the-art Stinger missiles . " As Logan spoke , two of St. Exeter 's bodyguards entered the garage behind him . Two more , in greasy coveralls , climbed out of a repair pit to flank him . Half smile in place , Rene stared at Logan with eyes like black empty holes . " You 're not gon na pay , " said Logan . It was not a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a wrench out of his stained coveralls . Stupid . Logan hit the man with enough force to drive his jawbone into his brain . A grunt , and the mechanic crumpled . Logan snatched the tool from his dead hand before the man struck the ground . Dodging a bullet fired at point-blank range , Logan spun and hurled the wrench at the man who 'd pulled the trigger . A crunch of bone , a splash of red , and the shooter 's head jerked back . As he fell , his Magnum dropped at Logan 's feet . Logan ducked a wild shot , then snapped up the weapon . He fired without aiming  --  a lucky shot . The bullet clipped the second bodyguard 's throat . Gurgling , he fell to his knees , clutching at his neck in a widening pool on the concrete floor . Finally , Logan 's luck ran out . The last of Rene 's bodyguards charged , in an attempt to push Logan into the repair pit . The pair fell in together . At the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shadow fell over them . Logan looked up in time to see St. Exeter toss an object into the hole . " Catch , mon ami . " Logan snatched the grenade out of the air . When the bodyguard saw it , he lunged for the ladder . " Where you goin ' ? " Logan grabbed the man by his collar , spun him around , and jammed the grenade into his gut . Wheezing , the bodyguard folded around the explosive and Logan released it , then dove for the opposite end of the pit . Heat and gore washed over Logan as the muffled blast slammed him against the concrete wall . Bleeding from a patchwork of wounds , Logan crawled out of the pit that had become the bodyguard 's grave , only to discover that Rene St. Exeter had fled the scene . Logan caught up with him a few days later , on a public street in the heart of Montreal . The final confrontation occurred amid a dozen gawking witnesses , but Logan did n't care . Some things , like payback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rage had passed , Logan felt no regret  --  only anger that he was forced to move on . Later that same night , he planned to hop a freight . His destination : the Yukon . As far north as Logan could go , to the very edge of civilization . He 'd leave behind everything  --  a Lotus-Seven , some worthless possesions , his past . With a bit of luck , Logan could start over . Start over ? " Good place to start over , eh ? " The voice  --  familiar  --  came from years past . Back when Logan was still with the Defense Ministry . Back when he operated out of the Ottawa branch of the CIS . Logan had been hunched in a corner , honing his blade , when the stranger approached . He 'd looked up long enough to see past the big man 's proffered hand , to the name tag tacked onto his broad chest : N. Langram . The screech of metal on tortured metal resumed as Logan sharpened the edge of his K-bar knife . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a weight bench across from Logan 's . The training area was empty but for them . Minutes before , they 'd been told that their training had ended , that their first assignment was at hand . " I think it 's a great place to begin again ... the CIS , I mean , " continued N. Langram . " I 've been to a lot of places , done a lot of things , legal and illegal , and I 'm happy to forget my past and bury it forever . " Langram slapped his knees . " To my surprise , after all my mischief , the Defense Ministry and the CIS decided to let bygones be bygones and offer me a second chance . " " Good for you , " said Logan . " I figure they 've done the same for you , eh ? " Logan fingered the tip of the blade . A drop of blood dewed his fingertip . He tasted it . " My name 's Langram ... friends call me Neil . " This time , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quiet one , eh ? " Logan spun the knife and plunged it into the scabbard . Then he crossed his arms and stared into the distance . " I 've been wondering why they paired us . You and me . We 're strangers and we 've never even trained together . So I 'm trying to figure out the angles ... " " What have you deduced , Langram ? " Missing Logan 's sarcasm , Langram tried to answer the question . " Odd parameters for this mission , do n't you think ? " he began . " I mean , why not a simple HALO jump ? The CDM has hundreds of soldiers who 've trained for High Altitude Low Opening insertions , and hundreds more qualified for reconnaissance infiltration of hostile territory . Which means they do n't need either of us . We 'd be considered overqualified for this mission , except that the men in charge decided to do a few things the hard way . " " Like ? " " You have to admit that there are n't too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are proficient in the use of the HAWK harness , " said Langram . The HAWK , or High Altitude Wing Kite , was a specialized piece of " personal aerodynamic hardware " developed for use by the Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Division  --  and SHIELD did n't give lessons on how to use their high-tech flying suits to just any soldier . " Maybe the top brass thinks the HAWK is the best means of insertion , " said Logan . " With a HAWK we can control our own speed and angle of descent , and when and where we land . And we can fight back  --  even while we 're airborne  --  if it becomes necessary . " Langram nodded , conceding Logan 's points . " I know all that . I 've used the HAWK before . And so , apparently , have you , Mr. Logan . " " Your point ? " " Maybe you and I crawled through the same mud , " said Langram . " Or maybe we just have some of the same friends ... and enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , eh ? " Secrets . I 've got plenty . Too many for me to handle sometimes . " That 's okay , Logan . I wo n't pry . " " You already have . " Langram refused to take offense , and they sat in uneasy silence for what seemed like a long time . " I know the geography pretty well , " Langram said at last . " The Korean Peninsula , I mean . And the area where we 're going , too . " " Nice place ? " " If North Korea is a prison , then the region around Sook Reservoir is solitary confinement , a cell on death row , and the gallows all rolled up into one ugly bastard of a package . " Logan shrugged . " Sounds delightful . " Langram studied the other man . Logan avoided his gaze . " So that 's my expertise , " Langram said . " And since you do n't appear to be a nuclear weapons specialist , I figure you know either the local lingo or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . " " And since you are very skilled with a blade , and you ai n't Korean , I have to assume you know plenty about Hideki Musaki and all his Yakuza thugs , and about the weapons-grade plutonium they hijacked on its way to that top secret government laboratory up north  --  the one processing weapons of terror . " Logan nodded once . " I know Hideki Musaki ... personally . But we 're not tight . " Langram smiled for the first time since their meeting . " So you 've wandered the Far East , eh ? Somehow I knew it . Seeing you reminded me of a place ... a dive called Cracklin ' Rosa 's . And a man , too . A fellow known in those parts as Patch . He had a proclivity for the blade ... just like you . " Again , Logan did not reply . Langram glanced at his watch , then stood . " Got to go , Logan , " he said . " But we 'll be seeing each other a lot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said about the CIS being a good place to start over . To ditch your past if you want to ... not many get a second chance . " Langram turned to go . " Hey , Langram . " This time , Logan was on his feet and facing him . " I 'll watch your back if you 'll watch mine . And when this mission 's over , if we 're both still alive , I 'll buy you a drink ... " Another drink . And another . But never enough to bring release . Wait . What was I thinking about ? Like wisps of mist , the memories of that first meeting with Neil Langram slipped away . Reduced by a creeping amnesia to dazedly pondering the drink in his hand , Logan watched as the whisky morphed from clear brown to cloudy green . Nauseated , he looked away . On the other side of the window , the word prophecy glowed with ghastly phosphorescence . An acrid , chemical stench assailed his nostrils , and battered couch springs dug into his flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lolled and his eyes closed . Sleep came , but Logan 's dreams were no different than his waking life . He longed for escape while he continued to run , his legs pumping on a perpetual incline , stretching farther and farther into the future . At the top was the humming neon of the Prophecy sign , waiting there , waiting for him . Suddenly awake , Logan bolted upright , crushing the glass in his grip . Thick red blood pooled in his palm , but he felt no pain . Logan staggered to his feet , impatient now to flee , to escape before the apocalypse swallowed him up . He tugged the flannel shirt over his wide shoulders . He pondered the predictability of his nightmares . Visions of pain and bones and spikes . Of vile stench and horror . And of dagger hands ... Searching for the keys to his car , Logan rummaged through a pile of yellowing newspapers . He noticed a headline on a grease-stained tabloid : Mercy Killer " Quack " Eludes FBI . Under the headline , next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a portly , bearded man with a bland , unremarkable face . The picture and the headline vaguely troubled Logan , but he did n't know why . When he tried to snatch the memory threads to connect them , they dissolved like streams of vapor in his increasingly clouded mind . Lightning cracked the sky , split another tree . Another warning . Storm 's comin ' , and it 's a big one . The big one . The one I 've been looking out for . Logan pocketed his money and his keys . He left the Prophecy without a backward glance . His last memory : the neon sign blinking steadily in the rain . Suddenly , Logan was sitting on a bar stool , hunched over a stained counter of a dingy gin mill . Outside , through filthy plate glass , the rain had stopped . A blanket of dirty snow covered the broken streets and sidewalks . When did it snow ? Hands shaking , Logan reached for the bottle at his arm . He swallowed , wondering if all the booze had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental blackout . Logan had no memory of the drive , yet through the big window he could see his Lotus-Seven parked in the lot . Did he drive through rain , then snow ? Had hours passed ? Or days ? Had he missed the freight train ... and with it his only chance to escape ? For the first time in Logan 's memory , panic welled up inside of him . Another swallow of whisky took care of it , but left confusion in its wake . Logan regained a certain measure of control by observing his surroundings  --  the bartender calmly washing glasses while watching a muted television tuned to a soccer game . Another man seated at the opposite end of the bar , drinking quietly . Logan sniffed the air , and his nose curled at the smell of rank booze and stale tobacco . Tubes like worms . Boring their way into his ears , nose , his mouth , his brain . Outside , a lone traffic signal switched from green to yellow to red and back again . There were no pedestrians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeple down the block was running backward . We travel into the future every second we live , but no one can go back in time , according to Einstein . Which proved the old geezer was n't so smart after all . In the shadows , under the dartboard , Logan spied three men with long coats and sunglasses , hats pulled down over their faces , drinks untouched in front of them . They sat at the edge of darkness . Waiting . Watching . Time to go ... Logan rose , tossed a wad of bills on the bar , and headed for the door . The shadow men ignored him ... or seemed to . Their inaction gave Logan hope , but not much . Outside , his heavy boots crunched the icy snow . Boots . Like a soldier 's . Like mine . I was a soldier once . No , twice . I fought in two wars . Both of them a long time ago . Logan looked down to find his boots gone , his feet no longer clad in hard leather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere . But this covering was pristine and virgin white . The reflective snow of his youth . It coated trees and blanketed rocks . It shimmered with frost under a pale winter sun . The tavern , the parking lot , the shadow men had disappeared . Logan padded alone through a silent mountain forest . Home ? Could I be home already ? Hoarfrost crunched under the balls of his feet . The chill seeped bone-deep into Logan 's wiry , teenaged frame . But despite the frigid air , the darkening sky , the deepening snow , Logan slogged ahead . It was the burning rage that pushed him , maddened him  --  an unreasoning need for vengeance that drove Logan farther and farther into the wilderness . Through calf-deep snow , Logan followed the spoor , moving quickly in a painful effort to catch up to his elusive quarry . Numb fingers clutched his father 's long knife , ready to strike , ready to stab , to rend . Eager to kill . At a rocky precipice cleared of snow by the relentless wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan scanned the forest , then sniffed the air , hoping to locate his prey by scent alone . Harsh winds stung Logan 's face  --  a face raw from the bitter cold and bruised from the beating he 'd received at the hands of Victor Creed , the bully known to the local settlers of this region by his Blackfoot Indian name , Sabretooth . I know Creed hates me . But I do n't know why . More secrets , deeper and darker than the forest around me . Sabretooth had turned up at the door of Logan 's log cabin hours  --  or was it days ?  --  before , just as he had every year around this same time . There was neither rhyme nor reason to Creed 's visits  --  only that they always occurred when Logan was alone . Logan had walked beyond the boundaries of his father 's homestead , inside the tree line where he gathered firewood for the cold days and nights ahead . He was alone again . His father had been gone for weeks , fur-trapping up north . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious furs he 'd gathered during trapping season , the elder Logan had left behind his hunting knife and a fierce husky named Razor . Returning with a heavy bundle of dry timber , Logan had heard Razor 's frenzied barks and angry howls , muffled by distance , by snow and by trees . He 'd tossed the firewood aside and hurried back to the cabin as fast as he could run . He found Razor 's blood and brains staining the snow , and the Blackfoot helping himself to the pelts Logan 's father had left to dry under the winter sun . Through tears of rage , Logan stared down at the murdered animal while Creed 's taunts battered his ears . Then , with the savage cry of an enraged beast , Logan hurled himself at his tormentor , to land on the man 's back . Logan clawed at Creed 's face and tore at his throat with his teeth . With a fierce growl of his own , Sabretooth dashed Logan to the frozen ground . Stunned , he sprawled in the snow next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness , Logan saw the Indian loom over him . Heard the man 's stinging laughter ringing in his ears . Felt the torrent of kicks and blows that rained down on him . Finally , the blackness rose and swallowed him up . Much later , Logan bolted upright , his body numb from the cold . The sun had crossed the sky , the day fading . Logan 's memory returned , and with it a murderous rage . Racing to the cabin , Logan snatched the hunting knife from its place over the mantle . Without regard for the elements or the waning daylight , Logan set off , determined to hunt down Sabretooth and end his enemy 's existence once and for all . Within the first hour , Logan lost Creed 's trail , then picked it up again . Now the Blackfoot 's spoor was mixed with another 's . A bear 's . A large one , by the size of the prints . Like Creed , the animal was moving up a crude mountain trail toward higher ground . Minutes later , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from behind a boulder . The grizzly roared a challenge , and Logan reared back in surprise . Lumbering forward on its short hind legs , the mammoth grizzly towered over him . The animal weighed at least four hundred pounds . When it roared again , hot spittle splashed Logan 's cheek . The creature 's steaming breath rolled over him . For a moment , Logan felt paralyzed . Then he raised his knife and let loose with a howl of his own . Moving forward , the blade slashing back and forth , Logan prepared to face the creature 's massive onslaught . The bold , unexpected move startled the bear . The beast halted , eyes wide , ears twitching  --  just out of the blade 's reach . Legs braced , Logan prepared to charge . His rage clawed his heart and he longed to slash and stab this creature  --  any creature . Nothing could threaten him . Time seemed suspended as man and beast eyeballed each other very cautiously and carefully . Then , from somewhere behind the grizzly , Logan heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the looming grizzly , Logan spied four black eyes peering at him from under a tangle of low , snow-laden pine branches . Black fur rippling , brown snouts wet and steaming , the frightened cubs emerged from cover , only to cower behind their mother . Seeing the helpless pups , Logan lowered his blade . With wary eyes locked on the angry grizzly , he took a single step back , then another . The bear snorted , her fur bristling , as Logan continued his careful retreat . Even in his harsh world , Logan believed that not everything that was a threat should be destroyed . " Go in peace . You are not my enemy and I am not yours , " Logan whispered softly as he continued to walk backward , down the trail . The bear sensed Logan 's intent . She dropped on all fours , then turned her quivering back on the human . Slapping the cubs with her front paws to move them along , the grizzly plunged between the snow-covered trees . Logan watched the creature retreat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet . When the bear had moved out of sight , Logan closed his eyes and leaned against a tree , heart racing from the aftershock of the unexpected encounter . When he opened them again , Logan found himself outside the tavern , in the middle of the snow-covered parking lot . The night had grown much colder  --  unseasonably cold , unless Logan had lost weeks or months since his time at the Prophecy , instead of mere hours . But he had no time to worry about that now . Not with the shadow men so close ... With a stab of relief , Logan spied his Lotus-Seven . The top was down  --  absurd in this weather , even for someone who did not feel heat or cold like everyone else . Logan found his keys and slid behind the wheel . The throbbing roar of the engine reassured him . But before Logan could throw the vehicle into gear , figures emerged from the darkness . Then a man spoke . " Mr. Logan ? " Logan looked up just as something hard , cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ribs , and pierced his lung . A hot gorge closed his throat . Wheezing , Logan struggled to rise , as toxins surged through his body , sapping his strength , bringing his mind to a standstill . Helpless as a dishrag , Logan was dragged from the car . He lashed out  --  only to be pummeled to the cold ground by vicious , unseen fists . With the last of his waning strength , Logan fought back . But as the powerful tranquilizer took effect , the dark and the pain devoured him . Just before consciousness slipped away , Logan felt an odd sense of relief . There was nothing more he could do now . Days of running and nights of hiding were over . Escape was no longer possible . The apocalypse has begun . Continues ...
