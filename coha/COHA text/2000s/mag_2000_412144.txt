Here 's what U.S. CATHOLIC readers know , because the Bible tells them so . HOW IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE Bible like knowledge of the family car ? Let 's let Michael Pearl of Aurora , Colorado count the ways : " Most of us own at least one ; many of us are content to follow the manufacturer 's guidelines for operation and maintenance . Others want a thorough knowledge ( such as a home mechanic ) . Still others neglect it until the car breaks down . " Pearl is one of 178 U.S. CATHOLIC readers who took part in a recent survey on Bible-reading habits . According to our findings , U.S. CATHOLIC readers are fairly accomplished mechanics when it comes to knowing all the vital parts that lie under the hood of the Holy Bible . And they know what routine maintenance is required to keep a scripturebased spirituality humming . Half say they have participated in a Bible study ; 58 percent acknowledge their use of cheat sheets and study guides to help them pick their way through the nuts and bolts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of readers say they think Catholics ought to improve their mileage when it comes to Micah , Mark , and Matthew , there are a few who cry " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it ! " Such as this reader from Salt Lake City : " I was received into the Catholic Church as a senior citizen about 15 years ago , after a lifetime of Protestant membership . Catholics keep telling me they do n't know anything about the Bible , but they seem to have an excellent under  --  standing-even if they ca n't quote chapter and verse . " // Still , reciting " chapter and verse " is something many U.S. CATHOLIC readers seem comfortable doing . A full third of the time , respondents did n't lapse into familiar shorthand-say , " the Sermon on the Mount " or " the separation of the sheep and the goats " - and instead rattled off specific references like old pros . Sermon on the Mount ? That would be Matthew 5-7 . John 15 ? That 's the story about Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 : 25-28 ? That 's the Old Testament passage about turning stony hearts to flesh . Those Catholics who say that their exposure to scripture is limited to Sunday Mass maybe are n't faring so badly , either . A few failed attempts to look up a Bible quotation ended with the realization that some readers were reciting exact song verses , not Bible verses-the refrain from " Sing to the Mountain , " for example . As Chicagoan Dorothy E. Maleski explains , " There are many psalms that come to me when I am down and troubled . I remember them from singing responses on Sunday . " A last observation : It 's a remarkably young set of Catholics that is doing this reading . More folks in their 20s and 30s responded to this particular U.S. CATHOLIC survey than perhaps ever before . Current trend-trackers might look at this and note the way in which Jesus is increasingly a hero figure to younger generations . Others might say they 're simply picking up Catholicism 's oldest owner 's manual . Q : What 's your favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psalms topped readers ' lists , as did all kinds of variations on the New Testament . " As a recent returnee to the church , I find it difficult to find the words I need to express myself in prayer , " explains Richard Notman of Eureka , California . " The psalms help me praise and give thanks when I 'm in a spiritual dry spell . " Adds Fran Serpe of Berwyn , Illinois , " As a pastoral musician , I find the psalms a shortcut to genuine prayer . " Katie Sullivan of Pottstown , Pennsylvania likes not just the psalms but the whole of " the Old Testament because it 's so earthy . Many of the people God chooses to lead the Israelites-well , they screw up . And that gives me hope . Not just for myself , but for people 's ability to change . " But except for the psalms and a vote of confidence for poor old Job , Old Testament material merited hardly a mention with most readers . One cited , simply , " New Testament . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's epistles topped the list of New Testament offerings , in particular his Letter to the Romans . Of the gospels , John was the evangelist of choice : " John 's gospel , " says Lena Grecco of Valley Stream , New York , features " insight and beautiful prose ; it draws me into the human and divine Christ . " Other readers had different New Testament favorites . " Acts . I see the humanity of the apostles and the interaction that they faced trying to understand and share all that they had experienced , " notes Thomas Cobb of St. Charles , Maryland . " Luke 's gospel . It speaks to me as one invited to view the life of Jesus in his concern for all humanity , " says Grace Hendel of Stevens Point , Wisconsin . Marge Mattice of Kewaunee , Wisconsin points to " Matthew 's account of the Last Judgment ' ( chapter 25 ) . Not only does Jesus let us know there will be a final exam , but he tells us what the questions will be ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address specific issues and concerns , many of which are as relevant and meaningful today as they were then , " adds Theresa E. Tabor of Frankfort , Illinois . " I find a great deal of encouragement in them . " Some readers noted a certain continuity running from Old Testament to New : " The accounts of women who were responsible for making sure God 's promises were carried out : Rachel , Sarah , Abigail , Mary of Magdala , etc. , " says Sister Madeleine Tary , O.P. of North Dartmouth , Massachusetts . Q : Apart from the obviousJesus , Mary , or Yahweh-who is your favorite character from the Bible ? This question brought nearly a three-way tie-among Peter , Paul , and Mary Magdalene . " Paul ! Because of his radical transition : from ultimate sinner to ultimate man of God , " says a North Dakota reader . What 's interesting is that some of the Mary Magdalene responses echo the above sentiment about Paul , even though contemporary scholarship has shown that Mary Magdalene was not the big sinner that tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter is any perfect specimen , either-or that readers mind . " His portrayal in the gospels and Acts is so believable . His humanness endears him to those who are trying to understand and follow Jesus , " says a reader from Georgia . Other favorites : " Abraham . A father of faithfulness , a humble , honest , human creation , " says Jay Booth of Deposit , New York . " Job is one of my favorites because he shows us that it is OK to lament and work through our brokenness . I read Job at a time in my life when I was feeling very helpless . Job was comforting , " notes Debbie Walker of Waynesville , Missouri . " King David . Great leader who sinned greatly . He repented and went back to being a great leader-no regrets , no guilt , " says David Sharp of Wickenburg , Arizona . Pat Ruggaber of Wheaton , Illinois likes " Martha . I can relate to her Well , somebody 's got to do the work ! ' attitude . " " Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as I had ) . They took care of each other , " explains Pauline Navarro of Placentia , California . Lawrence McNeil of Bloomsburg , Pennsylvania picks Sarah : " The fact she put up with Abraham and his God and never said That 's enough , already . " ' " Thomas . He believed in Jesus not because of the miraculous but because of his woundedness , " observes.Sister Mary Benet of Chicago . Q : What one verse , section , or tendency in the Bible do you find most disconcerting ? In most instances , readers were bothered by the Old Testament 's reputation for violent vengefulness . Marilyn Greene of Aldie , Virginia deplores " the bloodiness and brutality of the Old Testament-that it took God so long to change his people . " And a reader in Bennington , Vermont thinks it 's " barbaric " how " in Kings , people conquered other nations and killed all their foes ' people , animals , servants . " What 's even harder to reconcile , say many readers , is that the bloodthirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the God proclaimed by Jesus . One reader notes God calling Abraham to sacrifice Isaac . " This demand seems unworthy of God , who should know full well of the depth of Abraham 's faith . " But the Old Testament is n't the only trouble spot for readers . Several-not just women , but husbands , priests , and deacons-were unhappy with the oppressive way women ( along with gays and slaves ) are treated throughout the Bible . But the worst offender , they say , seems to be Paul 's epistles . " I asked my wife , and she said Paul , " ' one reader stated simply . " I am disturbed not so much by the Bible , but by the refusal of some Christian readers to seek a deeper understanding of verses like 1 Timothy 2:12-I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men ; she is to keep silent ' ' - instead of using them as an excuse to justify prejudice and oppression , " explains Debbie Walker of Waynesville , Missouri . Chicagoan Eileen Pavlik cites the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands . " I do n't feel that it is necessary for anyone to submit to anyone else . " Finally , even the most noble among us probably ca n't help but be a little disconcerted about so many of Jesus ' ultimatums : sell all you have and give it to the poor , take up your cross and follow me , love your enemies . A number of readers wonder whether they 'd have a sheep 's chance in Hades if they were made to line up in Matthew 25 . " Luke 14:26 , with Jesus saying his followers must leave their mother and father . Everywhere but here Jesus preaches love . This quote seems divisive , isolating , and markedly uncharitable , " insists Irene M. Piekaski of Seattle . " The rich young man , because I think Jesus was too hard on him , " says Gerald O'Shea of Portland , Maine . " If your hand is your downfall , cut it off . ' Some countries take it literally , " points out Father Robert Timchak of Williamsport , Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other reasons , as in : " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? " ( Matt. 27:46 ) , says Father James J. Doyle , C.S.C. of Wilkes Barre , Pennsylvania . Q : What do you remember as being one of the most surprising things you ever learned about the Bible ? What has surprised readers ? " Learning that only one gospel writer actually saw Jesus , " remembers Martin E. Foal of Joliet , Illinois . " That there are more gospels that were never canonized ( and never noted in church ) , " adds R.J. Windgassen of Venice , Florida . Another curious surprise : " Finding out in high school that there were two different creation stories in Genesis , " recalls Trudy Cranston of Westmont , New Jersey . But some pleasant surprises , too : " The number of women mentioned in the Bible . I think there are more than 75and we hear so little of them , " notes Annette Swiderski of Redlands , California . Thomas Cobb of St. Charles , Maryland likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a small passage but whole sections or even books at a time . " For Diane Maguire of Lawrenceville , Georgia , the surprise is one that never ends-for her or us . " That it is a love story of God and his people , and that human nature has n't changed much in 3,500 years-which makes the Bible truly timeless . " Join the conversationonline .
