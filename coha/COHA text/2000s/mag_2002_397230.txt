Police find the remains of two girls , and a town wonders what took so long Photograph Hundreds of townspeople came to Weaver 's home to grieve for the girls . " It seems everyone was at the fence . " said nf Photograph Michelle Duffey , mother of Miranda ( left ; Ashley is at right ) , says , " It 's hard knowing she was right there the whole time . " // In the long , uncertain months since two Oregon City girls disappeared while walking to the same school bus stop-Ashley Pond , 12 , on Jan. 9 ; Miranda Gaddis , 13 , on March 8-friends and relatives have never wavered from three key convictions . Neither girl , they say , would have climbed willingly into a stranger 's car . If grabbed , both would have put up a violent struggle . Each girl , therefore , must have known her kidnapper . That chilling theory may have been confirmed when police announced on Aug. 25 that a body discovered in a shed behind a nearby home had been identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unearthed beneath a cement slab in the house 's yard were found to be Ashley 's . As townspeople thronged the site , they leapt to one conclusion : Ward Weaver , 39 , who rented the house , is the murderer in their midst . Weaver , who knew both Ashley and Miranda and was once imprisoned for assaulting a woman , professes his innocence , and Oregon City Police Chief Gordon Huiras says charges " will not be filed until after we 're finished at the scene . " But local residents are already upset with police for not closing in on Weaver sooner . Photograph " We do n't have any other suspects we 're considering , " special FBI agent Charles Mathews says of his team ( searching Weaver 's yard ) . Photograph Ashley told a school friend that Weaver ( above ) was " really nice . " // " We all informed the FBI that he was a person to look at , " says Andrea Perry , 34 , a data processor who lives near the apartment complex where both girls resided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he 's creepy . " One of those girls , Maria Vera , 16 , lives within yards of Weaver 's unkempt yard . She says Weaver often stepped from his home on school mornings to watch the girls congregate at the bus stop a block away . " He would act like he was working on his cars or he just stared at us , " she says . " I would get this creeped-out feeling . " Vera says she shared this information with investigators when she was questioned in mid-March . " Everybody was telling police to look at him , " she says , breaking into tears , " and they did n't . " Others , though , saw Weaver 's house as a safe haven  --  including Ashley , who was . estranged from her own father and was close friends with Weaver 's daughter Mallori , 13 . " She looked up to him because he was a father figure , " says close pal Marissa Marquardt , 13 . Ashley joined the Weavers on a family vacation to California and even lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she had fun , " says Michelle Rizzo , who coached the school dance team on which Ashley , Miranda and Mallori all competed . Rizzo remembers Weaver as an overprotective father . " He would bring Mallori lunch in the middle of practice and also bring extra food for some of her friends , " she says . " He did n't want his daughter wearing makeup . " Though Weaver , who has repeatedly described himself to reporters as a prime suspect in the case , likes to reinforce that paternal image , his own sister seems to have a very different sense of him . In a July interview he said , " My sister , the first time she saw Ashley , she told me I got to watch myself . I said , " Shut up , she 's 12 . ' ' " Several of Ashley 's friends say that her friendship with Mallori crumbled in seventh grade after Ashley accused Weaver of molesting her , a charge that he denies . James Keightley , 35 , who is the fiance of Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and Lori in August ' ' 01 , they reported the alleged assault to authorities . " We thought it was taken care of , " says Keightley . " Only recently we figured out that no charges were filed . " Around the same time , authorities successfully prosecuted sexual-abuse charges against Ashley 's biological father , who had abused her several years earlier . He was sentenced to probation . The girls ' disappearances ( " Who Took These Girls ? " PEOPLE 's June 3 , 2002 cover story ) hit Mallori hard . " She would just start crying suddenly , " says Rizzo . Mallori told her coach that on the days that each of her friends went missing , she was supposed to have met them at the bus stop , but instead had been given a lift by her brother . " She kept saying that nothing would 've happened to them if she 'd been there , " says Rizzo . " She blamed herself . " Huiras says that the police search that finally turned up the bodies in Weaver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could legally get on this property , " given Oregon 's strict search laws . Charles Mathews , who heads the FBI field office in Oregon , allows that police dogs may have missed Ashley 's scent during an earlier , more limited search because her body was concealed in a steel barrel buried beneath cement . He adds that evidence indicates that Miranda 's body " had been moved and put in the shed fairly recently . " As for the public outcry over investigators ' failure to move more quickly , he says , " To classify someone as being a suspect without a confirmation of charges , frankly , we 're not so comfortable doing that . " Both girls " families support investigators ' efforts . " We 'd like to see it move faster , but not at the cost of not convicting whoever is responsible , " says Ashley 's great-uncle Arnold Ebright . " They 're doing it correctly , and we have great admiration for all involved . " But many in town take issue with the deliberate pace of the investigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son Francis 's 19-year-old girlfriend , to which he has pleaded not guilty . After Weaver was safely under lock and key in Clackamas County Jail , Francis phoned 911 and alleged that his father had admitted to killing Ashley and Miranda . " I 'm holding the FBI responsible for what happened to Francis 's girlfriend , " says Kristi Sloan , one of Weaver 's two ex-wives . " It should have been taken care of five months ago . " Sloan says that she repeatedly urged the FBI to check beneath the concrete slab that Weaver poured shortly after Miranda 's disappearance , claiming that he planned to install a hot tub . " I felt like I was talking to a wall , " she says . That slab also attracted the attention of Harry Oakes , 46 , a dog handler for the International K-9 Search &; Rescue Service . Called in by Lori Pond to conduct a private search , Oakes says that when he searched the property in March with Weaver 's permission , his dog signaled " death alerts " near both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he urged authorities to " dig up Ward Weaver 's backyard " when he forwarded his findings in April . " Dogs , " he says , " do n't know how to lie . " While Weaver sits behind bars , unable to post a $1 million bail bond on the rape charge , details from his family history are emerging that bear an eerie resemblance to his current situation . His father is a California death row inmate who murdered a young woman and her fiance in 1981 , then moved the woman 's body twice before settling on a burial spot in his backyard , which he topped with a wooden platform . Weaver himself spent three years in a california prison after hitting his son 's babysitter in the head with a chunk ot concrete . Both of his ex-wives have obtained restraining orders against him , charging that he threatened them with violence . Photograph " The FBI has wasted time , " says Weaver 's ex-wife Kristi Sloan .

She recalls that after Miranda 's disappearance , Weaver asked her out for drinks ; invited her and daughters Maryssa , 15 , and Miriah , 12 , to a barbecue in his yard ; and invited Miriah to go with him and Mallon to Disneyland . " It was like a game , a joke , with him , " she says . Duffey has spoken with Mallori several times since the girl was taken into state custody , following Weaver 's arrest on the rape charges . Duffey stresses that she does not hold Mallori accountable for her father 's alleged actions . " I ca n't imagine what she 's going through , " she says . Mourners who congregated last week outside the barbedwire-topped Cyclone fence that surrounds Weaver 's property no doubt feel the same pain on Duffey 's behalf .
