<p> Shane Fisher knelt and grabbed a handful of dirt and glass on the side of Highpoint Road . <p> " This is my friend , " he said as he let the contents of his hand drop back to a bare spot beside the road . " This glass was his car . " <p> Were it a normal Thursday , Fisher would have been in class at Brookwood High School along with his friend , Daniel Peek . But it was n't . Fisher had come to pray at the spot on Highpoint Road outside Snellville where Peek 's SUV crashed May 5 . Police say Peek was n't wearing a seat belt and that alcohol and speed may have been contributing factors . Peek died from his injuries Wednesday night . <p> " How many more are going to have to die ? " Fisher asked . " Teens think they can handle these things , but they ca n't . We 're just kids . " <p> Last week , the sadly familiar storyline of a young life cut short played out at Brookwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , the impact was expanded and intensified because Peek was the high-profile quarterback of the school 's football team . His funeral is Monday . <p> The 17-year-old 's death also raises the sadly familiar question : What propels kids to take risks behind the wheel despite an abundance of messages and programs designed to prevent them from doing so ? <p> Like many other American suburban communities , Brookwood has been here before . In 1990 , the Gwinnett County Teen Traffic Tragedy Task Force was formed in response to a series of accidents over the previous three years in which at least 10 Brookwood students had died . <p> The task force disbanded in the mid-1990s , but its work led to a 1994 CDC study titled " Risky Driving Behaviors Among Teenagers  --  Gwinnett County , Georgia , 1993 . " The study found that more than half the teens surveyed admitted to dangerous driving habits . About 63 percent reported they had tailgated , 80 percent reported driving more than 20 miles an hour above the speed limit and 91 percent reported entering an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the study said taking such risks " makes driving more fun . " Of the approximately 3,000 crashes that occurred in Gwinnett in 1993 , the study reported , more than one in four involved at least one teen driver . <p> " Younger teens have heard the messages about using seat belts and drinking and driving , but the same message has n't come across on speeding , " said Robert Dallas , director of the Governor 's Office of Highway Safety and the vice chair of the state Drivers Education Commission . <p> Although Georgia has yet to put a statewide drivers education program in its public schools , 16-year-olds have to complete a drivers education program either online or through a driving school before they can receive a license . They also must prove they 've driven a minimum of 40 hours with an adult as a part of their training . On top of that , the state 's ninth-graders are required to participate in an Alcohol Drug Awareness Program as a part of their health courses to be eligible to later get a restricted driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas said . Last year , at least 100 teenaged drivers died in crashes . Curbing dangerous behavior behind the wheel means addressing teen attitudes toward risk , Dallas said . <p> And risky behavior is reinforced by much in teen culture . In the ' 60s , " Teen Angel " and " Leader of the Pack " memorialized highway deaths . In the 2000s , teens see ads touting fast cars , and video games that glorify speed and risk-taking . " At that age , there is no death , " said Dunwoody-based psychologist William Doverspike , a former president of the Georgia Psychological Association . " They believe , ' It wo n't happen to me . ' " <p> Dr. Gregory Berns , a psychology professor at Emory University , has been conducting a study on risky decision-making among teens between the ages of 12 and 17 . His research shows so far that kids literally ca n't help taking risks  --  the area of their brains governing risk inhibition and planning for the future is n't fully developed until about age 25 , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior is most active during the adolescent years . <p> " Their brains just are n't fully wired , and it 's unreasonable to expect mature behavior in a young brain , " Berns said . <p> Because evaluating risk involves experience , kids who are new drivers are particularly vulnerable to making a bad decision behind the wheel , he said . <p> " The way you reach a conclusion is usually through experience , so you 'd had to have had a few near misses in order to make good judgments , " Berns said . " Unfortunately , with teens and alcohol and cars , there 's often not a second chance . " <p> Peek 's death should serve as a reminder that programs and lessons teaching teens to think about the risks associated with driving need to be repeated over and over again , said Christi Kay , who served as coordinator of the Teen Tragedy Task Force . <p> " The kids change from year to year , so there needs to be a constant effort . These kids are so inexperienced , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agency that promotes health-enhancing behaviors among young people . Even when schools and parents are doing their best to prevent these accidents , she added , " some kids do n't listen . " <p> " I wish there was a silver bullet to stop these things , but there is n't , " Kay said . <p> MONDAY SERVICE <p> The funeral for Brookwood High School quarterback Daniel Peek will be at 3 p.m .
