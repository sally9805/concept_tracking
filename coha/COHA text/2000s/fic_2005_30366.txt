Practice Tattoos 1987 If I make seven free throws in a row , Violet Cervantes will like me . I 've made ten straight before , but now the rim is hard to see because it 's late and the courts at Kranz have no lights . It feels like I 've been out here for a couple of hours , but still I do n't wan na go home because my mom and Gina were fighting over Gina 's boyfriend when I left . Knowing my mom , she wo n't get over this guy Max having his ears pierced . I shoot the ball and miss . It bounces left to another court , the rim on this one all crooked and bent from someone hanging on it . Okay , if I make six in a row , Violet will like me . I shoot and make it . Then two . Three . Four in a row . I 'm about to make number five , but I stop because I hear yells and the smash of a bottle from the other end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably cholos . Even though my mom makes me go to church with her twice a week because she says I make her feel safe , I 'm so skinny that there 's no way I could stop a bunch of drunk cholos from killing me if they wanted to . I turn around and shoot at the rim way on the other side , thinking of Violet , hoping the shot goes in . When the ball misses , I run after it and wonder where to go next . Gina 's dragged the phone into her room to talk to Max , laughing loud and making lots of noise because our parents are n't home . The cord 's stretched straight from the phone jack by the couch , down the hall , under the door to her room . It looks like a tightrope , and I step on it , arms out for extra balance . One step and the cord pops out from the wall . Something bangs on the other side of Gina 's door . I close my eyes , keep my arms stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net will be there to catch me before I hit the ground . I open my eyes and Gina 's staring at me , puppy dog slippers on her feet , green towel around her head like a genie . She calls me a fuckin ' weirdo , then slams the door to her room . I 'm weird ? I 'm not the one with black nail polish on my toes . The one whose friends all think they 're punk rock Draculas . I mean Gina 's boyfriend , Max , all he wears is black . His pants are all tight and he always wears a leather jacket like it 's glued to his back . Last month , when we went to see Beverly Hills Cop , I saw him and his friends pushing his green Tercel at the mall . It was almost summer , and the bus I was on had air-conditioning . Just looking at him pushing that car out in the heat and wearing that stupid jacket made me sweat . Max is weird , but at least he 's not Junior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his face . He was super-skinny too . One time I saw him with his shirt off and his stomach was all caved in like it was trying to eat itself . Him and my sister were together for like six months . For Gina that was like six years . When he would come and pick up my sister it was always a big deal . Gina said it was because Junior lived over in Pico Rivera and he had to take three buses to see her . I remember him biting his lip as he waited by the door for my sister . Junior always had this shitty , pissed-off look on his face , like he just came from a fight he had started and lost . The last time anybody talked about Junior was also the last time I saw my mom drive the car . Math homework was kicking my ass that night . My mom answered the phone and listened for a few seconds before saying Junior 's name and making the sign of the cross . She took the pencil from my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write in the margins . The dishes stayed in the sink , and my mom had me recopy her sloppy directions as she looked for the car keys and her purse . My mom 's always been afraid to drive , but there she was , going fast and crazy , running a red light and honking at the screeching cars like it was their fault they were in our way . We flew through Whittier Narrows and got to the bowling alley in about ten minutes . The big signs advertising 36 lanes and the slo-poke lounge colored everything red . My mom drove around the packed parking lot , and I went inside to look . The place was chilly from too much air-conditioning . I went up to the front desk , and before I could talk , the guy behind the counter put down the pair of shoes he was spraying and told me to get in line . Instead , I checked the pay phones and thought a couple times about going into the ladies ' room . I wandered down to one end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gina 's face . A bowler hollered in a lane nearby and kicked at the air like a ninja as the people around him laughed . I said Gina 's name over and over as I tried to remember what she had on when she left the house . After a while I went back outside and walked around the building . I could hear my mom before I even saw the two of them . The car was in front of an orange Dumpster , driver door open , engine still running . One of the headlights shone on Gina ...
