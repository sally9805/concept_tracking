Chapter One Tsippi krauthammer noticed things about her customers , but the American woman caught her interest more than the others for a simple reason : Tsippi made matches , arranged blind dates with all kinds of people , and here might be an opportunity to make a shidduch . She gravitated toward the difficult ones , the ones other matchmakers were reluctant to touch , those who had given up hope : a widow with seven young children , men missing parts of their bodies from the wars , a professor who had twenty-seven rabbits in his living room and would n't let a single one go . Between weighing the onions and making a clatter on the cash register , she had pulled off more than fifty marriages . And every marriage better than my own , she joked . A woman of forty-eight told her , " I thought I would marry one day , but never-ever-did I expect to feel this happiness , happy like a bride of eighteen . " To bring together disparate souls gladdened her . She did n't get paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a rug , a ceiling fan for the store , a fancy juice maker . Others got paid a thousand dollars from each party , but she did it for the sake of the mitzvah and the pleasure it brought her . What she had first noticed about the American woman was her hair . The hair itself was an anomaly in this street of yarmulka , scarf , wig , and black hat wearers . Either she was not religious , Tsippi surmised , or maybe not as pious as the block 's Ashkenazi Orthodox residents , or else she was simply not married and had no reason for covering her hair . This American woman-she had to be an American : Who else would pay three times the price for StarKist Tuna instead of opting for the serviceable Israeli brands ? And anyway her accent betrayed her-this American brought her moods to the grocery store . Sometimes she walked down the aisles , poking , turning a cereal box in her hands , groping , squinting , yearning for something Tsippi 's shelves could n't deliver ; sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a tomato ; and sometimes her hands moved with a happy efficiency , like the hands of a regular ba'alabusta whose years of list-making had already been absorbed into her very fingertips . Tsippi tucked a strand of gray hair under her paisley scarf and busied herself ringing up the items of a customer , a young boy with blond-haired peyos wrapped delicately behind his ears . She cut him a hunk of pumpkin squash for his mother 's chicken soup , threw in a free bag of chocolate dreidels ( leftovers from her Hanukkah stock ) , and recorded the entire amount in a shiny green notebook . The boy 's family paid at the end of the month , though only the Almighty knew how . They always rushed for the two-day-old bread on sale , the rotten bananas nobody else would buy . Lately , things had gotten worse with the recent cuts in food subsidies . Though when it came time for Mr. Weinshtock to pay the bill , he 'd crisply lay out the shekels on the counter as if nothing was amiss . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for extensions . Not him . She wondered about his wife and how scraping by had affected their marriage . Then she shook her head . What business did she have thinking about other people 's marriages ? Better to save her speculations for the unwed . Now this American woman with her bare head of hair ( possibly the only uncovered woman over twenty on the block ) intrigued her with her dreamy way of walking and her forlorn , slightly aggrieved air . She looked about thirty-five , educated , attractive-well , attractive enough . Tsippi wondered which street she lived on and why she had only begun to come to the store in the last month . Maybe she had just moved to Kinnor Road . There could also be another reason . Lately , a flock of Moroccans , Iraqis and Yemenites had been making their way to her store , along with other assorted Sephardim , and she had finally figured out why . Her store was not far from a small Sephardic courtyard of houses , Harp Court , which for years had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Perhaps the American woman had come in on that wave , though it hardly seemed possible that she lived there , in the ramshackle Sephardic area , with people who did not seem to be the educated type , though it was unfair to judge . Tsippi had begun stocking more of the spices the Sephardim liked : the cumin and cardamom and turmeric , the hawajj and hilbe . Gradually she would accommodate the Sephardim . But before she went around rearranging her shelves she wanted to know these customers were here to stay . As for the American woman , she would have to go through her list more carefully to see if anyone sprang to mind . Her sons ( all five of them married , thank God , with children of their own ) were always asking about her methods , how she decided to put so and so with that one and not another . How could she explain ? She liked to juxtapose two people in her mind , imagine them eating a falafel together , or setting a table . If no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard part was n't coming up with a match , but executing it , and there was the real secret of making a shidduch : chutzpah , pure nerve . Because many people could come up with good ideas . It annoyed her the way acquaintances would say , " Oh yes , I thought of Yossi and Miriam , too , " and she would always restrain herself from asking , " So why did n't you , then ? " She knew why . They were frightened . She , Tsippi , normally on the timid side , for some reason was never upset if the parties were insulted ( Me with him ? Do I look fifty pounds overweight ? Do I ? ) and abused her with their complaints , their How-could-you 's , their wounded expressions . She brushed them off and did her work . She had conceived this idea , that she would make matches , after she had been liberated from the camps , at Treblinka . All around her , Jews-the few that remained-were stretched out , dying of Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the onslaught of nutrition , and a great murderous rage rose up inside her . She would get even with Hitler . She would make matches , shidduchs . Every couple she brought together-saliva in Hitler 's stupefied face . Every child born-more dirt and worms on his grave . The best revenge in the world . This was how she had started long ago . And God had blessed her with the chutzpah to make matches that others might only dream of , in a land that had been dreamed into existence less than four decades ago . " Tzippalah , Tzippalah , whatever are you thinking ? " " Shlomo , " she said , almost reproachfully . Her husband had emerged from the little room in the back and had caught her unaware . He knew how to move quietly for a large man . She stared at the reddish tips of his white beard and offered him a small oval plum from a wicker basket on the counter . " Any new deliveries ? " Shlomo asked . He muttered a blessing and ate the plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the store . He took out a pen and paper and a small coin , and began to make calculations , sorting through the potatoes and yams and leeks and kumquats , measuring , removing a portion for the poor and other groups . All fresh produce that arrived went through the same tithing ritual . Then he returned to the little room where his chevrutah study partner sat waiting for him in front of an open Talmud . They had been learning together now , almost every day , for over ten years . Before this , Shlomo had been a kosher slaughterer , a shochet , but as he got older he no longer had the stamina for the bloody work , and so she 'd opened this Makolet grocery store . In this way , she had enabled Shlomo to study-not just a few hours , but full-time , like a regular yeshiva student . Throughout the day little bursts of Aramaic pierced the grocery-ein haki nami , l'afookay , ma chazis dedamach sumak tfey ? - sounds that settled over the fruits and vegetables and canned goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of Aramaic , but the men 's Talmud study nourished her . What they were doing back there was important , and so she felt important and holy , too , even while involved in mundane matters like cleaning out the freezer or balancing the books . She was lucky , luckier than most . Others had far less . Why should she complain ? * * * " Ca n't you stay longer , Bet ? " said Zahava , pronouncing her name minus the " th , " like most Israelis . Beth shook her head and saw the young woman 's features visibly sag . " Sorry , Zahava . Shabbat 's coming and I have to go . " She shrugged guiltily toward the sun . Actually , it was a fat three hours until sunset , and she could 've spared an extra twenty minutes , but she did n't feel up to it . The psychiatric ward , with its cloying overmedicated smell , gave her a headache where once the place had charmed . She had been volunteering for a year now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first she 'd been entranced by the magical-schizophrenic utterances of Zahava , the disturbed woman she regularly visited . The first time she met a patient who thought she was a Biblical prophetess , Beth could n't get enough details . But the place was filled with such characters . Eventually the Deborahs and Miriams , the Ezekiel wannabes , all lost their shock and entertainment value ( for unwittingly , she acknowledged , she had turned the patients into entertainment ) and became just everyday emotionally-disturbed persons in need of care . And she did care , particularly about Zahava . But she had to pace herself or she 'd sap out completely . Beth slung her batik knapsack across her shoulders and began the walk home . The stretch along Kveesh Darom extended for three miles and should 've been considered the most morbid in Jerusalem . At the farthest end was a prison buried in the trees of the Jerusalem Forest , then a rifle range , followed by the geriatric-psychiatric institution where she volunteered , and then as the road curved closer to the residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to these grim landmarks . Her walk home took fifteen minutes and she enjoyed every moment of it . Few cars came this way and even fewer buses . The sky , even now in the post-Hanukkah rainy season , had its days of vivid , optimistic blue . When the day gave forth clouds , they piled on dramatically in gigantic swirls . Olive and acacia and fig and carob trees grew on one side of the winding road , giving way to a downward sloping hill dotted with occasional boulders . Down below , the Jerusalem Forest stretched on , an endless wave of evergreens . Israel was strange that way . In the summertime trees drooped , and now in the winter they came to life , helped on , no doubt , by the five months of rain . On the other side of the road , a hill rose sharply and became a more sedate , manicured forest , its prickly eucalyptus trees steepling into the sky . Just past the tombstone factory , Beth wound her way down a thin dirt path and settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate candy bar , her reward for her good deed at Broken Souls , and drank a can of mango soda , also a treat , resting the items on a flat-topped boulder . Good ole Jerusalem Forest . She could always count on the forest to restore her and , lately , she was in sore need of it . The past year she 'd been undergoing a crisis of faith . Not enough to abandon the mitzvahs or her way of life , but enough so that she 'd stopped attending Torah classes at a women 's yeshiva where she 'd been a part-time student . A skepticism had seized her . Verses and sections that had made sense now mystified or even outraged her-animal sacrifices , the laws about Canaanite slaves , that disturbing verse : " an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . " It got to be she could n't pick up a Bible . She might 've asked a rabbi or teacher to help her interpret these verses , but she never could bring herself to approach anyone . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world to see the spilled juice , the rotting , moldy food . So she had settled into a chronic religious anxiety while staying connected by whatever means-more meticulous observance of the laws , increased prayer-until , she hoped , she would feel differently . Prayer had always been something of a struggle for her , but here in the Jerusalem Forest , talking to God came more easily . The Hassidic masters said a person should pray to God like a child pestering his mother or father . The forest was the place she pestered God-for clarity , for direction , for some Divine attention . The forest was also mildly dangerous . Sometimes a boulder from the tombstone factory came lurching down the mountain . Sometimes strange men wandered through . Once , on Lag B'Omer National Picnic Day , she 'd settled herself into an isolated campsite with lunch and a booklet , Outpouring of the Soul . In the distance she saw a small truck full of Arab workers coming at her , screaming , rakes and axes jutting out through the open windows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booklet , they 're headed somewhere else , but the truck came to a dusty screech ten feet away from her . Still screaming and shouting , they took their rakes and stamped out a still-smoking fire that had been left by the previous picnickers . Just as quickly , they piled back into the truck and left . Beth still had n't moved from her spot . It occurred to her then that the Arab workers had saved her life and prevented a massive forest fire . But what if the truck had carried a bunch of rapists or escaped convicts or terrorists ? She was defenseless in the forest . Anything could happen . She continued to come anyway , but sometimes she 'd carry a big rock she happened to find along the way as protection . She crumpled her candy bar wrapper into her purse , wiped her fingers and recited a Psalm , " I Lift My Eyes Unto the Mountains . " She could n't linger , though . The sun had dropped lower . Shabbat was coming . She entered Kinnor Road , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Ashkenazi origin , and then made a sharp right up the hill on Levites Street . Another right into Harp Court , with its red-tiled slanting roofs , the Sephardic enclave-home to Jews from Iraq and Morocco and Yemen and Algeria . On the other side of Levites Street loomed " Belt Morris , " the huge American apartment complex built of Jerusalem stone , named after a philanthropist from Florida who 'd donated money for the playground . That 's what she liked about Israel . She 'd only walked three blocks , and here she was , traversing civilizations . She was the lone American who lived in Harp Court , which was fine with her . She had n't traveled six thousand miles from Pittsburgh just to be with Americans . Still , she liked having her compatriots fairly close by , on the other side of Levites Street .
