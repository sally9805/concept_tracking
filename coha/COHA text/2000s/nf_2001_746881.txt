Section : Articles <p> Summary : <p> Background : Diagnosis and management of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) have been based primarily on expert opinion and practice guidelines rather than on evidence . We have used a registry to prospectively survey the presenting features and the diagnostic evaluation and management practices used for children with ITP worldwide . <p> Methods : We used the Intercontinental Childhood ITP Registry which had been widely advertised . 209 physicians from 136 institutions in 38 countries participated by submitting data for each of their newly diagnosed patients . Data from 2031 children with ITP was registered between June , 1997 , and May , 2000 , and we analysed 6-month follow-up data from 1496 children . <p> Findings : There was a peak in occurrence of childhood ITP during spring and a nadir in the autumn . Mean initial platelet count was 15.4310 9/L ( SD 19.7 ) . 1447 ( 73% ) of 1976 children were admitted to hospital . Initial management consisted of no drug treatment in 612 ( 31% ) , intravenous immunoglobulin in 576 ( 29% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 137 ( 7% ) patients . Intracranial haemorrhage was reported in two patients . <p> Interpretation : The variable approaches to management of childhood ITP demonstrate the need for prospective clinical trials , which should be feasible within such a study group . <p> Correspondence to : Dr Thomas Kuhne ( e-mail : Thomas.Kuehne@hin.ch ) Introduction <p> Management of childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) is based more on opinion and local practices than on evidence and has been the subject of fierce debate for decades . Although practice guidelines have been developed and published , 1 , 2 compliance with the guidelines is poor 3 , 4 and the validity of one set of guidelines has been openly challenged. 5 A network of shared consensus protocols and trials , such as is in place for malignant diseases , does not exist for this benign condition . The lack of an evidence-based approach is a disadvantage for patients , with diverse medical and socioeconomic consequences , reflected by the array of simple and sophisticated diagnostic procedures and treatments , from no therapy to multiple expensive platelet-enhancing agents with various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease has been described in several retrospective studies. 2 However , prospective data have only been obtained from randomised clinical trials with short follow-up and fairly small numbers of patients . <p> We aimed to establish an international network of physicians involved in the diagnosis and management of children with ITP , to prospectively collect clinical data regarding the natural history and management of childhood ITP , and to compare results with previously published reports . Patients and methods <p> The Intercontinental Childhood ITP Registry was established in June 1997 by the Intercontinental Childhood ITP Study Group to prospectively investigate the pathophysiology , clinical course , management , and outcome of children with ITP . The group advertised the Registry on its web-page ( www.unibas.ch/itpbasel , accessed Dec 7 , 2001 ) , at national and international haematology meetings , in haematology journals , and by regularly mailed newsletters to prospective participants . <p> Each patient older than 4 months and younger than 16 years with newly diagnosed ITP seen at a participating centre was eligible for registration . However , participation was voluntary and therefore it is assumed that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by completing and submitting an entry sheet . This first single-page questionnaire requested the address of the physician and data from the patient including date of birth , sex , date of diagnosis , platelet count at diagnosis , whether a bone marrow aspirate had been done , whether the patient had been admitted to hospital , and whether treatment ( intravenous immunoglobulin , corticosteroids , or both ) had been given or not . The entry sheet was submitted as soon as possible after the diagnosis of ITP to the coordinating centre in Basel , Switzerland . After 6 months the coordinating centre faxed a second questionnaire to each physician to obtain follow-up data , when it was possible to distinguish the acute from the chronic form of ITP , defined by a persistence of thrombocytopenia ( &lt;150310 9/L ) for 6 months or longer . The second questionnaire requested the follow-up platelet count , and established whether the patient had had bleeding during the 6-month period , whether intracranial haemorrhage ( ICH ) had occurred , and whether the patient had received additional platelet enhancing treatment or not ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 6 months . <p> Diagnosis of ITP was based on a platelet count of less than 150310 9/L , a normal haemoglobin concentration , white blood cell count , and blood smear ( except for thrombocytopenia ) and absence of underlying conditions such as HIV infection , systemic lupus erythematosus , and lymphoproliferative disorders . Bone marrow aspiration was optional . The Registry had been approved by institutional review boards according to local requirements . <p> Data in this study are multi-level . Patients are clustered within institutions , which are within countries , which have then been grouped in geographical regions . Thus , there are four levels of cluster . Additionally , the varying number of patients per institution , and institutions per country make the interpretation of statistical analyses difficult . Therefore the data will be presented in a descriptive form without statistical analysis . Results <p> From June 1 , 1997 , to May 31 , 2000 , 2190 children were enrolled by 209 physicians from 136 institutions in 38 countries . We included data from 2031 children with newly diagnosed ITP . The remaining 159 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aged less than 4 months or 16 years old or older . Of eligible patients , 6-month follow-up data on 1510 ( 74% ) children were received . Of those 14 ( 0.9% ) were excluded because of incomplete data , thus we analysed follow-up data from 1496 ( 74% ) patients . Mean time from diagnosis to the follow-up report was 170.6 days ( 95% CI 166.3-174.8 ) . We arbitrarily subdivided participating countries into eight groups representing continental regions , to detect common or differing patterns in the data ( table ) . The median number of registered patients per institution was 4 ( range 1-121 ) . 120 ( 57% ) of 209 physicians registered less than six patients , 59 ( 28% ) registered 6-20 patients , and 30 ( 14% ) registered more than 20 patients . Eight physicians ( 4% ) registered more than 50 patients , accounting for a total of 653 ( 30% ) patients . Participating physicians were mainly paediatric haematologists or oncologists ( 86% ) holding a hospital based full-time academic position ( 66% ) or a hospital position not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean age ( SD ) of all registered children was 5.7 ( 4.1 ) years ( figure 1 ) . Boys had a mean age of 5.5 ( 4.0 ) and girls had a mean age of 5.9 ( 4.2 ) . In the age groups less than 1 , 1-5 , and older than 5 years there were 149 ( 7% ) , 946 ( 47% ) , and 920 ( 46% ) patients , respectively . There were 1104 boys ( 54.8% , 95% CI 52.6-57.0% ) and 909 girls ( 45.2% , 43.0-47.4% )  --  ITP was diagnosed with a peak incidence in spring/early summer and a nadir in autumn ( figure 2 ) . <p> Figure 1 : Age of children with ITP <p> Figure 2 : Seasonal occurrence of ITP <p> To analyse the incidence of diagnosis by month , data from southern hemisphere patients were transformed as follows : month-north= ( month-south + 6 ) ; if month-north exceeds 1 year , 12 is subtracted . Thus , " July " in the southern hemisphere is equivalent to " January " in the northern hemisphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 15.4210 9/L ( SD 19.7 ) . At 6 months the mean platelet count was 209.7310 9/L ( 125.9 ) . Chronic ITP was seen in 31% ( 95% CI 28.9-33.6% ) of children in equal numbers of girls and boys . Mean age was 6.9 ( 4.3 ) years in children with chronic ITP , and 5.1 ( 3.8 ) years in children with acute ITP . In those aged less than 1 , 1-5 , or older than 5 years , 5% , 38% , and 57% of children , respectively , had chronic ITP . Children with chronic ITP had a mean platelet count at initial diagnosis of 18.4310 9/L ( 21.4 ) and those with acute ITP of 13.8310 9/L ( 19.0 ) . <p> A bone marrow aspirate was obtained in 985 ( 50% ) of the 1984 children for whom data was available . Bone marrow aspiration was done in 234 ( 39% ) of 606 untreated children and in 751 ( 56% ) of 1339 treated children . 214 ( 38% ) of 565 children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin , 444 ( 69% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 72% ) of 130 children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids had a bone marrow aspirate . <p> Of the 1995 patients for whom data on hospital admission was available , 1447 ( 73% ) were admitted to hospital , including 78% of those with an initial platelet count of less than 20210 9/L . The mean initial platelet count in admitted and non-admitted children was 11.6 ( SD 14.2 ) , and 25.2210 9/L ( 26.6 ) respectively . Untreated and treated patients were admitted in 47% and 85% of cases , respectively . Patients on intravenous immunoglobulin , corticosteroids , and intravenous immunoglobulin plus corticosteroids were admitted in 91% , 77% , and 95% , respectively . <p> Of the 1976 children for whom data was available on treatment , 612 ( 31% ) did not receive drug treatment , and 1364 ( 69% ) did , either with intravenous immunoglobulin ( 576,29% ) , corticosteroids ( 651,33% ) , or intravenous immunoglobulin plus corticosteroids ( 137 , 7% ) . 107 children ( 7% ) received either intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroids or both despite an initial platelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how treatment varied in different parts of the world . The mean initial platelet count of untreated children was 26.6310 9/L ( SD 26.8 ) , and of children receiving therapy 10.4310 9/L ( 11.5 ) . The mean initial platelet count of patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin , corticosteroids , and intravenous immunoglobulin plus corticosteroids was 8.0310 9/L ( 7.8 ) , 13.3 ( 15.6 ) , and 8.1 ( 11.0 ) , respectively . During the first 6 months , anti-Rh(D) was administered initially in five children and as additional therapy during the 6-month follow-up period in 27 ( 2% ) children . <p> Figure 3 : Management of children with ITP in eight geographical groups <p> IVIG=intravenous immunoglobulin , CS=corticosteroids . Management consisted of no treatment and treatment  --  ie , intravenous immunoglobulin , corticosteroids , or both . <p> The percentage of children receiving or not receiving initial drug treatment at the time of the diagnosis of ITP was in acute ITP 68% and 32% , respectively , and in chronic ITP 68% , and 33% , respectively . Intravenous immunoglobulin was given in children with acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children with chronic ITP in 40% ( 112/278 children ) . Corticosteroids were administered in children with acute ITP in 51% ( 317/620 children ) and in children with chronic ITP in 60% ( 166/278 children ) . <p> A platelet count of more than 150210 9/L at 6 months was achieved in 68% of untreated children , in 73% of children on intravenous immunoglobulin ( 303/415 children ) , and in 66% ( 346/527 children ) of children on corticosteroids . Intracranial haemorrhage was reported in two children among the 1496 children for whom 6-month follow-up forms were submitted . One patient was a 1.5-year-old girl in whom an ICH occurred 4 months after the diagnosis of ITP with a favourable outcome without neurological sequelae . The other patient was a 15-year-old girl with an initial platelet count of 16210 9/L and initially treated with corticosteroids . The time when ICH occurred and the outcome of the latter patient remains unknown . Discussion <p> The Intercontinental Childhood ITP Registry serves as a network for facilitating collaborative research in ITP with the advantage of its prospective nature involving investigators in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small numbers of patients recruited by 74% of institutions may be due to inconsistent registration , but is more likely caused by the relative rarity of the disease , as ITP occurs only in about one in 25 000 children yearly. 8 <p> Several features of childhood ITP have been confirmed , such as age distribution with a peak between 1 and 6 years , 9 presenting platelet count of less than 20310 9/L , and the fact that most children remit rapidly with or without drug therapy . Additionally , unexpected results have been observed , such as details of outcome and sex distribution with a higher number of boys , as previously described by our group 10 and others. 11 <p> Whether a bone-marrow aspirate should be undertaken or not has been a matter of long-lasting debate . It has been shown that isolated thrombocytopenia does not necessarily represent an indication for doing a bone marrow aspirate , 12 , 13 but if atypical features of ITP are present or if corticosteroids are considered as initial therapy , a bone marrow aspirate is usually recommended. 1 , 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this survey reflects the recommendation by the American guidelines , which state that it is appropriate for a child with severe , life-threatening bleeding regardless of the platelet count and for a child with a platelet count of less than 20210 9/L. 2 In an assessment of the UK practice guidelines , 83% of patients were admitted , 3 and in a survey of diagnostic and management strategies , age and type of bleeding ( dry or wet haemorrhage ) directed admission  --  ie , 85% of respondents reported that they would admit a 5-year-old patient with wet purpura , but only 41% admitted patients with dry purpura. 4 Thus , further prospective studies are necessary to collect clinical data on morbidity related to bleeding . This requirement is addressed in a follow-up registry to be opened soon . <p> The outcome of children with ITP at 6 months seemed not to be affected by initial treatment strategy . This observation confirms previously published prospective trials. 16-18 In a retrospective single-centre study , 51 children with ITP did not receive platelet-enhancing treatment and only four received short-term corticosteroids because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treated children , with chronic ITP occurring in 13% of the patients , and without the occurrence of life-threatening bleeding . The high incidence of chronic ITP in our patients might represent an artefact of under-reporting of patients with rapidly resolving acute ITP at 6 months . Children who developed chronic ITP had higher initial platelet counts at diagnosis and were older than children with the acute form . By contrast with pubished reports , 2 we did not report more girls than boys with chronic ITP . <p> Intracranial haemorrhage was reported only twice among 1496 children , of whom 69% were treated , which is far below the often quoted incidence of 1% 2 , 20 , 21 suggesting a very low risk of this complication during the first 6 months after diagnosis . However , this result must be interpreted cautiously due to incomplete follow-up data ( 74% ) and the possibility that some patients with intracranial haemorrhage at diagnosis might not have been registered even if such patients presented to participating institutions . Lilleyman suggested that the risk of intracranial haemorrhage increases with time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after diagnosis. 8 , 22 Most children with intracranial haemorrhage were reported in retrospective studies , whereas only one child with intracranial haemorrhage has been described in a prospective study. 23 <p> The key value of the Registry is the establishment of an international network , with the capability of accruing large numbers of patients with ITP , and confirming or refuting results derived by smaller studies . As a result of this collaborative network future studies will address the hypothesis that major haemorrhage , defined by intracranial or other overt internal or mucous membrane bleeding resulting in anaemia or requiring local treatment , 24 is uncommon in children with ITP and only rarely encountered after diagnosis and initial therapy . Data such as these will serve as a basis for conducting clinical trials answering the question  --  which subgroup of children with ITP requires drug treatment . <p> Contributors <p> T Kuhne designed the registry , took part in data analysis , and contributed to the writing of the report .
