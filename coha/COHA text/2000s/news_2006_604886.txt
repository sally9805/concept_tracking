<p> SAN FRANCISCO  --  Executives at Cisco Systems are grappling with an unusual problem for the networking giant : what to name new products . <p> Cisco usually just slaps technical monikers on its pricey back-office computer gear . The fact that a router is called CRS-1  --  and can cost about a million dollars  --  does n't faze the specialized technicians who purchase them . <p> But now Cisco has begun developing products for consumers . In the works are a DVD player and TiVo-like digital video recorder that can connect to the Internet using Cisco 's networking technologies . Both are scheduled to come out this year  --  if Cisco can pick names . <p> " One of the reasons that we have n't launched any network entertainment products is because we do n't have a branding strategy , " says Chris Stevens , the executive in charge of the line . While the Cisco brand is well-respected among business buyers , it hardly resonates with consumers . " A lot of people just know us as a stock to own , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other tech companies more geared to corporate sales must overcome if they are to succeed in the consumer market . Unlike businesses , consumers buy goods one at a time , demand high levels of technical support and are extremely sensitive to prices and trends . <p> It 's enough to make a company stay away . But tech firms from Cisco to Seagate Technology are plunging into the consumer market , even though they 're having to make big , painful changes to do so . The reason : Consumers are their best chance for growth . <p> Corporate technology spending growth has been slow since the dot-com bust of 2001 . It stalled completely in 2003 and , despite a crawl back , grew a modest 6% in 2005 from the previous year , says researcher IDC . In contrast , consumer electronic sales jumped 11% from 2004 to 2005 as shoppers bought digital music players , flat-panel TVs and other gadgets , says the Consumer Electronics Association , a trade group . <p> " We all made money in the 1990s on ( businesses ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology . " Now we all have to morph ourselves into consumer companies . " <p> Buying in <p> Cisco typically enters new markets through acquisitions , and the consumer market is no exception . Recent purchases include Linksys , a home and small-office network gear maker ; Scientific-Atlanta , a maker of cable TV boxes for Time Warner and others ; and Kiss Technology , a Danish maker of networked DVD players . <p> But while Cisco is known for the speed at which it merges acquired firms with the rest of its staff , these consumer-focused acquisitions have n't fit easily . In fact , Cisco runs its consumer arm under the Linksys name , as a near-separate company . Its offices are in Irvine , Calif. , about 390 miles from Cisco 's Silicon Valley headquarters . It has its own website , logo and administrative staff . <p> Linksys financials differ greatly from the rest of Cisco , too . Big routers often have a profit margin of 25% or more . Margins on consumer electronic products are usually less than 10% . " We recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stevens says . <p> Keeping the business divided might be a smart approach for some companies , says William Barnett , a professor of business strategy at Stanford University . " The organization and strategy that works really well in one part of the technology world does n't necessarily translate quickly to another part , " he says . <p> That 's because consumer-focused firms build their reputations from the bottom up , one shopper at a time . Business-focused firms rely more on a few large , successful rollouts , Barnett says . The two models are so different that sales , marketing and design all need to be overhauled to move from one to the other . <p> Keeping units separate is just one approach to the problem . Other tech giants are tackling it with : <p> *An organizational overhaul . Seagate became the world 's No. 1 hard disk drive maker by selling the data storage devices to Dell , Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers . They were built into corporate storage products as well as PCs . <p> Then computer sales tumbled after the dot-com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company looked into new markets , such as inexpensive stand-alone drives it could sell directly to consumers . The drives plug into any PC for extra storage of digital photos , music or other files . <p> But Seagate soon realized that consumers would n't buy the standard , bulky drives preferred by businesses . They wanted unique products designed to meet a particular need . <p> " I could do the whole ( corporate technology ) world with about seven products , " says CEO Watkins . " Now I have as many as 50 . " <p> To meet that demand , Watkins ( who was chief operating officer until 2004 ) re-organized Seagate . Instead of product teams , workers are now grouped by the markets they 're targeting . That allows them to explore new kinds of products , such as a portable hard drive that fits into a pocket . <p> Watkins also ordered designers to make drives more robust . He extended warranties from one year to five . " If you have a problem with Dell or HP , you can renegotiate your contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails , that person is never going to buy from you ever again . " <p> Thanks in part to that effort , new sales have boosted Seagate 's revenue and allowed it to post a $707 million profit in its 2005 fiscal year . <p> *A corporate culture shake-up . Semiconductor giant Intel has long made chips for consumer PCs . But they were usually the same as chips for business PCs , which is Intel 's biggest market . <p> But that cash cow faltered after the bust . Business spending slowed , and Intel made some manufacturing missteps . Rival Advanced Micro Devices gained share . Suddenly , the once-booming company was missing its own earnings forecasts . <p> CEO Paul Otellini ordered a shake-up and a new focus on the consumer market . He hired outside executives with consumer backgrounds , such as Samsung executive vice president Eric Kim and Gemstar-TV Guide vice president Marcelino Ford-Livene . That was a big departure for Intel , which is known for promoting from within . <p> " We had to change the people , we had to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intel Vice President Don MacDonald . <p> A team of ethnographers was dispatched to help develop products . Before , engineers tended to believe , " If you bring it to market , people will buy it , " MacDonald says . Now , they have to prove that a product will " delight somebody " and " fit in your life " before getting approval , he says . <p> Intel launched the first major product from this effort in January . Called Viiv ( rhymes with dive ) , it 's a set of chips designed to make entertainment PCs a lot easier for consumers to use . Viiv PCs are built to talk to other devices , such as TV set-top boxes , and handle movies , music and other content without a glitch . <p> It 's too soon to tell how well it will work . This month , Intel said that its first-quarter revenue would be lower than earlier forecast because of market-share losses and weaker-than-expected demand . <p> A key to Viiv 's success is whether Intel can persuade a majority of entertainment companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds , Intel is helping other companies design non-Intel devices to interact with Viiv PCs , such as televisions or digital music players . More than 300 employees have been assigned to the project , even though it wo n't directly generate a single dollar in revenue for the chipmaker . <p> *Gradual change . Research In Motion 's BlackBerry e-mail device was designed with business in mind . It was created as a corporate productivity tool . <p> But about two years ago , RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie noticed that spouses of BlackBerry owners had started to buy the gadgets to keep in touch with their busy partners . <p> A market was born that helped RIM keep growing through the bust years . To target it , RIM first started to add consumer-friendly features , such as instant messaging from Yahoo and mapping software from Google . <p> The company also focused on making BlackBerrys easier to use . One new feature allowed new owners to instantly activate their device over a cellphone network instead of waiting for a technician to do it . <p> " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology ) department , " Balsillie says . " You 're on your own as a consumer . " <p> ( Simplicity is one reason RIM settled a long-running patent lawsuit for $612 million this month . RIM said it had a workaround , but it would have required BlackBerry users to do a complicated upgrade . ) <p> But the biggest changes came from RIM 's marketing department . Corporations usually buy BlackBerrys in bulk and set up their own networks , but consumers buy them one at a time from cellphone carriers . <p> When Balsillie realized that many salespeople at Cingular , Verizon and other carriers had trouble explaining the devices , he dispatched an army of RIM staffers to teach them . RIM wo n't say how many there are , citing competitive reasons , but the number doubled in 2005 from 2004 . <p> " A data plan is a lot harder to sell than a voice plan , " Balsillie says . <p> Long-term payoff ? <p> These firms have all benefited from their push into the consumer market . But it will take time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term , says Stanford 's Barnett . Margins on consumer goods are low and there 's little room for error , so consumer companies need to be run carefully . " Wal-Mart is going to expect you to deliver when you say you are , " he says . <p> But if consumer focus does n't work out , it 's OK  --  as long as the company can adapt to changing market conditions , Barnett says . After all , consumers are the big spenders now , but they wo n't always be . More important is the ability to chase the next big thing . <p> For proof , look at onetime computer giant Digital Equipment Corp. , Barnett says . In the 1980s , DEC so dominated the market for big , back-office computers that it was second in size only to IBM . But it missed the shift to smaller , desktop computers and was sold off in pieces in the late-1990s . <p> Meanwhile , occasional DEC rival Dell has smoothly moved between consumer PCs , business PCs and back-office computer systems through the decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest PC maker . " Those of us who remember DEC ( really admire ) the capabilities we see in a Dell , " Barnett says .
