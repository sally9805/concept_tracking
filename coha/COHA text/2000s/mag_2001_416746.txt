San Diego Padres outfielder is assaulting the record books Photograph After breaking the record for most walks , Rickey Henderson , in his 23rd Major League season , acknowledges the fans ' applause when he surpassed the legendary Babe Ruth on April 25 , 2001. // At 42 ( 43 on Christmas Day ) , Rickey Henderson 's chiseled physique still can rival that of a 25-year-old . His thighs still appear to be taut enough to strike a match on them . But with the day-to-day wear and tear that has come during his Major League career , his body has taken a pounding . Even so , like the Energizer Bunny , he just keeps going and going and going . And as Rickey goes , so go the name changes in the record books . In April , at the beginning of his 23rd season , the San Diego Padres outfielder and the game 's best base stealer in history , set the Major League mark with most career walks , surpassing New York Yankees legend Babe Ruth . Following his latest entry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record-setting walk did n't contribute to a Padres victory . " If I 'm getting on base even if it 's a walk and scoring a lot of runs , then I 'm helping my team win ball games , " Henderson said after setting the walks record against the Philadelphia Phillies . " And that 's the key to playing baseball , period , trying to score as many runs as you can . " With the base on balls ( walks ) record now in Henderson 's possession , he has his sights set on other goals . Not only is he on the verge of becoming the next player to get 3,000 hits , but he also is closing in on Ty Cobb 's record of 2,245 runs . Observers marvel at Rickey 's continuing assault on the record books at his age , describing his accomplishments with such words as " incredible , " " unimaginable " and " hard to believe . " Some say he has recaptured his youth . But the 10-time All-Star who has played in three World Series says he never lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a consistent routine and some good luck . " Age does n't knock a player out of this game , " he says . " What gets a player out is injuries . I 've been fortunate because I 'm healthy . I never stopped working out . I feel like I did when I was 25 . " In an effort to continue to feel that way and to keep his 5-foot-10 , 195-pound body in top condition , the oldest position player in the big leagues prepares himself the same way he did when he came to the majors . He says he does an accumulation of at least 150 sit-ups and 150 push-ups three to four times a week , in addition to going through a stretching routine every night before going to bed . Plus , he eats sensibly ( a lot of fish and chicken ) , gets enough rest and understands his body well enough to know how far to push himself . " When you play this game long enough , you learn how to take care of yourself , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matured on the field and off since his stellar career began with the Oakland A 's , the team with which he has made most of his achievements . He established himself as what many consider to be the best leadoff hitter in history , one who still has a knack for jump-starting his team , and along the way has set a record for home runs to lead off a game . But it has been on the base paths where he has been most successful with each of the seven teams with which he has played . He was with Oakland when he stole 130 bases to set the single-season stolen-base record in 1982 , shattering Lou Brock 's record of 118 that was set in 1974 . He was still with Oakland when he surpassed Brock 's all-time career stolen-base record in 1991 . Photograph After collecting the all-time stolen-base record in 1991 , Henderson celebrates his 939th stolen base that eclipsed Lou Brock 's career mark . The San Diego Padres future Hall of Famer continues to prove that he is one of the game 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an enthusiastic love for the game , ironically , he almost did n't get a chance to continue to enhance his Hall-of  --  Fame career . A free agent at the end of last season , he was passed over by every team except the Padres , a team that brought him back for his second tour of duty in San Diego . He 's still stealing bases ; still hitting home runs ; and still doing whatever it takes to help his team win . The only question now is , When will his name be scribbled into the record books again ? Photograph In tribute to Henderson 's achievements , he is presented the " Player of the Century " award from Oakland As president Michael Crowley after As fans voted Henderson the team 's top player of the 20th century . // <p>
