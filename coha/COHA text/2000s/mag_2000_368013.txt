Everybody complains that political conventions have declined into nothing more than predictable TV shows . Not so . The conventions have declined into predictable TV shows and shameless off-camera fund-raising orgies . So last week there was one Republican Convention on the big stage , where the newly domesticated party leaders felt your pain and the gospel choirs whooped . But the real sounds of Hallelujah ! were going on at the other convention . That one took place all around town at the lobster-and-champagne galas corporate donors gave for their favorite members of Congress and the Republicans gave right back to thank their major contributors , long and hard , before shaking them down again . <P> By one estimate , there were as many as 900 such celebrations . But the G.O.P. is a party with a lot to celebrate . At the end of July , it closed the books on the biggest fund-raising month in its history  --  nearly $38 million in just 31 days . Cash is the Ecstasy of politics . On Tuesday afternoon , just a day after Colin Powell took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " giddy Republican fund raisers met at the Westin Hotel to marvel at the cash flow as it gusted through the party ledgers . " This is unbelievable , " one exulted . " We 've never had a year like this ! " <P> Or a convention so muscle-bound with money . At the downtown hotels , there were limos too long to turn into the oval drives . At the airport , there was Learjet gridlock . Everywhere there was Representative Tom DeLay , House Republican whip , chief money pumper and master of the revels , who spent the week stroking donors in a series of private vintage railway cars , which just happened to be the defining perk of the robber barons of the last Gilded Age . <P> Union Pacific supplied the cars . And AT &T; held a $500-a-person golf tournament/fund raiser to honor Montana Senator Conrad Burns , chairman of the Commerce , Science and Transportation Communications Subcommittee , which happens to oversee AT &T.; Even some companies that banned soft-money contributions to either party made " in-kind " contributions . General Motors provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other big media companies sponsored a glittery tribute to House members at a dance club . <P> When the two conventions crossed paths , it was usually in corporate skyboxes high above the floor where big donors rubbed shoulders with big Republicans while the convention went forward on TV sets hardly anybody bothered to watch . Why would they ? Eye contact with the power brokers of Congress was the real point of the proceedings . In the skybox suite for House Speaker Dennis Hastert , a lobbyist for Union Pacific fretted on Tuesday night that the Speaker had not shown up yet . " My entire board of directors is coming down tomorrow , " she said . " They 're going to be disappointed if they do n't get face time . " <P> For members of the press , face time was a problem . Some gatherings were harder to get into than that fancy sex party in Eyes Wide Shut . When a reporter was discovered , there was likely to be somebody shouting for security . But if you missed the cash bash in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Democratic Convention next week in Los Angeles . Plans are already under way for the reception at Armani on Rodeo Drive . As you may have heard , the other team also plays this game with authority . <P>  --  By Richard Lacayo
