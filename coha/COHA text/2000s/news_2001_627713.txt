Reservations : 281-351-3873 . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @56053 <p> American General Corp. , the only Fortune 500 financial services company with headquarters in Houston , said Monday it has agreed to be bought by Britain 's Prudential PLC for more than $ 22 billion in stock . <p> The 75-year-old company founded by Gus Wortham , a pillar of Houston 's financial community , will become a subsidiary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . <p> For each of their shares , American General shareholders will receive 3.66 shares of Prudential , which is not related to Prudential Insurance Co. of America . <p> Robert Devlin , American General 's chairman , president and chief executive officer , will join Prudential 's board as deputy chairman and run the North American businesses . <p> The deal and move are expected to be completed by the end of September . <p> That means by the end of the first year of the new century , all the insurance companies , banks and mutual funds started in Houston and nurtured during the last century into corporate giants will be owned by companies without Texas roots . <p> " To us , this merger is all about growth in the U.S. market , " Devlin said in a London conference call with financial analysts . " We are taking a bold step in realizing our strategic vision - and that is to become a world leader in financial services . " <p> While Prudential acquires American General , American General will be busy consuming Prudential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Lansing , Mich . <p> The combination of the two U.S. companies will allow American General to become the top seller of annuities in the United States . <p> " We 've been very close to that in the past , but this certainly will catapult us to clearly the No. 1 position , " Devlin said . <p> And adding American General to its book of business will push Prudential to the sixth spot among the world 's largest insurance providers . <p> Its market value will trail only American International Group of New York , Germany 's Allianz , The Netherlands ' ING , Germany 's Munich Re and France 's AXA . <p> To achieve both superlatives and realize $ 130 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2002 , about 225 corporate staff positions at American General will be eliminated , Devlin said . <p> Those job cuts represent 5.5 percent of American General 's 4,100 employees based in Houston . <p> But a company spokesman stressed that American General " will take every step possible to minimize the impact on employees through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include 300 positions in Houston alone , and through normal attrition . " <p> The company has only 80 employees in New York now and expects " to add only modestly to that count , " the spokesman said . <p> Devlin plans to keep offices in both New York and Houston , but his River Oaks home is up for sale for $ 1,495,000 and has been on the market for several months , said realty broker John Daugherty of John Daugherty Realtors , which has the listing . <p> The 4,200-square-foot home , built in 1935 , is located in a blue-chip neighborhood that has traditionally been an enclave of rich executives , oilmen and affluent professionals . <p> Prudential 's all-stock purchase of American General is being billed as the most a foreign company has spent to acquire a U.S. financial services company . <p> When the top executives announced the deal they said the stock exchange rate gave American General a value of $ 49.52 per share - triple American General 's book value . <p> " The size of the deal is probably bigger than many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a life insurance analyst for McDonald Investments in Cleveland . <p> But the record-breaking price tag was slashed to $ 22.5 billion in heavy trading Monday on the London and New York stock exchanges . <p> " A whole bunch of U.K. analysts thought Prudential overpaid , " said Steven Schwartz , a life insurance analyst with Raymond James in Chicago . " Prudential did n't get a steal , but they also did n't overpay , in my opinion . " <p> American General 's attraction , analysts said , is that it has a solid track record of consistently producing double-digit profit margins , creating innovative products , marketing its brand name and managing a wide-reaching distribution network of sales agents , bankers , brokers and financial advisers . <p> Also , American General diversified years ago its product portfolio with annuities , mutual funds and life insurance , and trained its sales staff to sell all of them , said George Ball , president of Sanders Morris Harris , a Houston-based investment bank . Very few insurance companies can boast of doing the same . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to merge with Prudential ? <p> " There 's the thought out there that this may not be the strongest foreign company that American General could hook up with , " Benacci said . <p> Prudential has steadily been expanding its business in Asia , which is still struggling to regain the economic momentum it had in the early 1990s . It needs a foothold in the United States , the world 's largest financial and retirement service market , to keep pace with its major competitors . <p> " People have concerns about the U.S. economy in the short term , but we 're in a long-term business , " said Jonathan Bloomer , who will become the chief executive officer of the combined companies . <p> If American General investors fear the timing of the deal or Prudential 's future financial prospects , they may sell off their shares as soon as they get them , which would further depress the stock prices of both companies , analysts said . <p> American General 's stock price has hovered around $ 40 for the last few months , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " somebody could come in and make a counter-offer , " Schwartz said . <p> American General has agreed to pay Prudential a $ 600 million fee if it backs out of the deal to accept a rival bid . <p> American General 's stock price closed Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $ 38.80 , down 55 cents . Prudential 's American Deposit Receipts trading on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $ 22.22 , down $ 4.08 . <p> <p> American General in Houston <p> American General Corp . has been one of Houston 's leading corporate citizens since its creation in 1926 . It is unclear how much of an impact its merger with Prudential PLC will have on its employees and the city : <p> The North American headquarters of the combined companies will move to New York City . <p> American General employs 4,100 at its headquarters in Houston . An estimated 225 corporate staff jobs would be cut as a result of the merger . <p> Robert Devlin , chairman , president and CEO , will move to New York to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining Prudential 's board : Robert Devlin , John Graf and Rodney Martin . Non-executive directors joining Prudential 's board : Larry Horner , Michael Poulos and Anne Tatlock . <p> Real estate owned by American General : <p> Town &; Country Mall and the company headquarters along Allen Parkway near Waugh . The campus consists of five office buildings , some of which are leased by American General to other firms . <p> Corporate giving : <p> Museum of Fine Arts , Houston 5K Race and the AIDS Walk . <p> In 2000 , the company donated $ 1.5 million to community causes , including United Way , the Anti-Defamation League , Holocaust Museum , UT Nursing School and over 5,000 hours of employee time to community organizations . <p> Source : Houston Chronicle staff reports <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  <p> NOTES : Chronicle reporter Ralph Bivins and Reuters News Service contributed to this story .
