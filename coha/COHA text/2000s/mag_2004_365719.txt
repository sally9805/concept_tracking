Several cities boast of being the first wi-fi burg in the U.S. Grand Haven , Mich. ( pop . 10,900 ) , contends it locked up the title when it covered its 7 sq . mi. last March . But it 's not the only player on the field . Cities such as Half Moon Bay , Calif. ; Athens , Ga. ; and Chaska , Minn. , let folks roam the wireless Web from street corners all around town . Whereas those places might be ahead of the curve , analysts say that big profits have been elusive for companies backing wi-fi projects . Just because you 're among the first does n't mean that you will last .  --  By Wendy Cole
