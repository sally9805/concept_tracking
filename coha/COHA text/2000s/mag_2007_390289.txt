Sidebar MAY 'S ECLIPSED MOON , seen here , favored the East Coast . This month , the Moon plunges deeper through Earth 's shadow , and the West Coast sees the best show . LOOK FOR THE STARS of Aquarius as the Moon makes its way through Earth 's shadow August 28 . ASTRONOMY ROEN KELLY Sidebar THE PERSEIDS POP IN A MOONLESS SKY The Perseid meteor shower 's annual August 12/13 peak occurs during New Moon . Moonlight wo n't wash out faint meteors , which makes this an especially good Perseid year . Warm weather and good displays make the Perseids the year 's best-observed meteor shower . The activity begins July 1 7 and lasts through August 24 . Meteor rates slowly rise to a peak over North America on the morning of August 13 , although significant activity occurs within a day of the shower 's peak . The radiant lies in the constellation Perseus , which rises in the late evening and is well placed by 11 P.M. local time . Like most meteor showers , Perseid activity increases during the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of comet debris . The International Meteor Organization ( www.imo.net ) predicts two peaks August 1 3 . The first , which is predicted to occur around 4 A.M. EDT , is best for North Americans . Normal rates of 50 to 60 meteors per hour may briefly double . THE METEORS FLY August 12/13 , when the Perseid meteor shower reaches Its peak . Observers at a dark site should average a " falling star " each minute . ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY SHADOW PLAY IN LONGOMONTANUS Ancient impact craters pepper the Moon 's rugged southern highlands . Bright Tycho is one of the youngest , and nearby Clavius is one of the oldest . Northwest of Clavius lies another large , ancient crater - Longomontanus.The walls of this 90-mile-wide crater have been pumrneled repeatedly by later impacts . On the northern rim , many of these craters overlap . The crater is nearly 3 miles deep . Watch the walls ' shadows creep along the crater 's floor during sunrise , around the time of First Quarter . As the Sun illuminates the crater , a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Longomontanus begins August 21 . This isa good time to grab your first view of this ancient impact site . Watch the crater over several nights . Changing shadows will give it a different look each time you view it . 3-mile-wide WATCH SHADOWS morph across the floor of 90-mile-wide Longomontanus Crater this month .

The reason : The Moon penetrates more deeply into the darkest part of Earth 's shadow this month , ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY A COMET 'S MESSIER MASQUERADE Comets give observers a great way to test their powers of observation . Superficially , an average comet looks much like a galaxy - faint , round , with a bright core fading to a diffuse edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Messier ( 1730-1817 ) began cataloging " comet look-alikes " 230 years ago . Little did he realize the objects he recorded in Virgo were actually whole galaxies like our own . Comet C/2006 VZsub 13 ( LINEAR ) courses through Virgo this month , and it passes by many galaxies . Now glowing at around magnitude 11 , VZsub 13 is a modestly challenging object in a 4-inch scope from dark country skies during the month 's first half . Can you spot the comet 's faint tail at low power ? We see VZsub 13 broadside , so any tail should be well defined . Increase the magnification to study the inner coma 's shape . The bow shock where the solar wind pushes back the comet 's gases may give sharp definition to the coma 's leading edge . Compare VZsub 13 to the many nearby galaxies , like the Sombrero Galaxy ( M 1 04 ) , M49 , M61 , NGC 4753 , and NGC 4697 . By the next waning Moon , Comet LINEAR will have faded into the south . Take a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glides through Virgo in August . The fading comet slips past many galaxies of comparable brightness . Compare them , and you 'll soon see why Charles Messier decided to catalog galaxies as " comet-nots . " ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY VESTA BUZZES GIANT JUPITER By month 's end , asteroid 4 Vesta will be an easy find in binoculars as it scoots just north of Jupiter . It 's only marginally more difficult to spot earlier in the month , for the space rock lies just a binocular field to the planet 's right . Vesta shines more brightly than most of the starry background in this sparse sky region . Vesta appears to move faster than Jupiter because it 's closer to Earth and has a higher orbital speed . The asteroid 's nightly motion is relatively easy to detect , but seeing it shift in a couple of hours is a bit tougher . A handy guidepost lies just north as August opens . On the 18th , Vesta is a mere 8 ' south of 4th-magnitude Psi ( ? ) Ophiuchi . During the last week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter . The asteroid slides from northwest to northeast as it buzzes the giant planet . Avoid trying for Vesta August 21 . The waxing gibbous Moon will be grazing the orange giant Antares just a few degrees away . Vesta , a 300-mile-wide rock , was discovered visually by Heinrich Olbers ( 1758-1840 ) March 29 , 1807 . The Arizona-sized asteroid is the first target of NASA 's Dawn mission . Launched in early July , Dawn will use its ion engine and a 2009 gravity assist from Mars to reach Vesta in 2011 . The probe will remain for 8 months , then move on to dwarf-planet Ceres . What a way to celebrate Vesta 's 200th year in astronomers ' catalogs ! VESTA GIVES observers a telescopic treat in late August . The asteroid slips north of Jupiter close enough that a low-power eyepiece can include both objects .
