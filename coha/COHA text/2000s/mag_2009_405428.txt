Turn Off , Tune In , Log Out While I think Twitter is quite ingenious -- and I use it daily -- I 'd rather it did n't exist June 15 . I like getting updates from people I admire , but I always think about them tweeting while they 're supposed to be doing other things , and I wonder how the quality of their work will suffer because they 're not entirely focused on it . Alyssa Green , DINWIDDIE , VA . The overblown coverage of Twitter in the media has grown tiresome . Steven Johnson reports that Twitter had 17.1 million visitors internationally in April , but with the U.S. population at more than 300 million , the percentage of users that are American is pretty small . Furthermore , according to Nielsen , 60% of users drop out after a month . " Once just a fad " ? Sounds like it 's still a relatively small and concentrated fad . Members of the media never grasp that they are not representative of the country as a whole . Barb Neff , SANTA MONICA , CALIF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were typing and reading tweets . This means that they were not engaged in the discussion at the table and that this new communication tool was actually distracting from rather than enhancing the discussions at the forum . It can easily be argued that the ideas lost from the discussion at hand far outweighed the brief ones gained via Twitter . Aside from being a new venue to reinforce our sadly shortened attention spans , Twitter is a narcissist 's dream of one-way communication . I , for one , will never care what Shaq is doing or thinking about anything . I do n't care what anyone had for breakfast . I do n't care what I had for breakfast . Tom Granger , WILMINGTON , DEL . I predict that the twitterification of our society is going to lead to an exponential increase in early-onset Alzheimer 's . We 're increasing the rate of input to our brains and decreasing the time for processing information , and our brains are going to revolt . That , in turn , will lead to the next big industry : de-twitterification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a giant aquarium and a beanbag . Marty Decker , BEND , ORE . Health Care and the Hill In her article on health-care reform , Karen Tumulty states the health industry needs a " cultural and economic revolution " June 15 . I can not agree more . But in her discussion of the five big health-care dilemmas , she omitted two key financial advantages of a single-payer system : dramatic reduction in administrative costs and elimination of profit . A single-payer system would immediately make hundreds of billions of dollars available to purchase health care and give everyone access without increasing taxes or costs to employers . Hospitals , physicians and other providers could be paid more appropriately , and the benefits package could be expanded . Such a system would also reduce providers ' costs by decreasing their administrative burden . Why is a single-payer system being ignored by Congress ?

If those were brought under control , health-care costs would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lawsuit prevention . " But it wo n't happen . Most people in our government are lawyers . Robert K. Wismer , MILLERSVILLE , PA . According to a recent report , 131 million people would take the deal of a public health-care plan , including two-thirds of those who now have private insurance . What does that say about the wishes of the American people ? Yet the worry seems all about driving the private health-insurance industry out of business . There are at least two bills now in Congress that would provide a universal public plan -- including how to pay for it -- and help health-insurance workers displaced by it . But it looks as though we once again may wind up with what the lobbyists for Big Pharma and insurance want us to have , thereby guaranteeing their continued profits and campaign donations . It is discouraging to see business prevailing as usual while Americans wait to have a system that 's at least as good as those of other industrialized nations . Jean Quinlan , STAUNTON , VA . Food , Direct Though I do not eat much beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . I grew up on a farm in Arkansas where my sister and I stood on the fence and waved goodbye as the cows were loaded onto the truck to be taken to market , and where my dad once made me and my friends get up at 6 a.m. after a sleepover and dig potatoes . My kids have been growing up in the suburbs , not knowing where food comes from . Now we are growing vegetables in the backyard , and they are helping debone the chicken , even if it seems " gross " at first . I think we will treat our environment better when we have a closer connection to where our food comes from . Sara Barton , ROCHESTER HILLS , MICH . I find it interesting to read how , because of new economic necessity , many people are acquiring food and homekeeping practices that rural folk have followed for years . Growing produce , buying half of a steer and raising chickens or bees are being described in such terms , one would think the wheel had been reinvented . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat and one for the fruits and vegetables we raise . This has enabled us to survive raising four children in a rural economy . I am finally able to tell my children that they never realized their old parents were trendsetters all along ! Patty Connolly , CORVALLIS , MONT . How to Talk to Iran The picture of U.S. envoy Dennis Ross as presented in " The Final Countdown " is frightening June 15 . Ross should not have been placed in charge of dealings with Iran . His close connection with the largely anti-Iran organization American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) is well known . Despite Obama 's seeming change in course on Iran , Ross continues to endanger the U.S. and the Middle East by pursuing the hostile neoconservative agenda on Iran active in the Bush Administration . William Beeman , MINNEAPOLIS You say Dennis Ross is not naive . I believe he is if he thinks Iranians can be persuaded to switch focus to the economy -- and question why their regime is not spinning money and enriching the country -- while their centrifuges are " spinning day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are far poorer , can live with this set of priorities out of a sense of national pride , why ca n't the Iranians ? Kangayam Rangaswamy , WAUNAKEE , WIS . The At-Times-Unfriendly Skies Thank you for your article about Flight 447 and the history of aviation , which , as a 17-year-old technology fan , I found remarkable June 15 . It opened my eyes to everything I take advantage of in this world filled with gadgets that can do anything and with practically immediate travel all over the globe . Maybe America should take a lesson from less technologically advanced nations , whose citizens , instead of being in sync with their computers and cell phones , are probably in sync with their families , their lives and their surroundings . All the things we " need " are just pulling us away from what is really important in this world . I hope more people can learn to be thankful for what they have .

DeStefano case before the media learn to ask the right question ? Sotomayor , the junior judge on a three-judge panel , did not endorse New Haven 's decision to discard the promotion test for a group of firefighters when not enough minority firefighters passed the test . She merely declined to step into the matter -- as an activist jurist might have done -- to tell New Haven that discarding the test was the wrong thing to do . Those are different actions . If anything , the Ricci case proves that Sotomayor is not an activist jurist . Dale Whiting , CHANDLER , ARIZ .

Missing from them -- lawmakers , lobbyists for hospitals and insurance companies , union leaders and even Wal-Mart -- is a key group : the people who dedicate their lives to studying illness , go deep into debt for the privilege of caring for patients and work long hours to fix and cure what ails Americans -- just so they can spend more time wrestling with the red tape of the insurance companies and dodging the trial lawyers .
