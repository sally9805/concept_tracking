<p> Nearly a year after Major League Baseball adopted a new , expanded system of revenue sharing , and in the aftermath of another eventful countdown to the trading deadline last week , it is clear that baseball is far from operating under an entirely new economic order . The rich teams are still richer and the poor teams , in comparison , are still poorer . <p> But there is evidence suggesting that the new financial model is having some impact . Other than the Yankees , teams are striving to keep their payrolls under the new $117 million threshold that sets off baseball 's luxury tax . A year ago , Major League Baseball was projecting that six to eight teams would be unable to resist a midseason splurge and would face the tax . Instead , even prosperous teams  --  the Yankees notwithstanding  --  are at least examining their salary costs with a thrifty eye . <p> That has led to a second outcome : more than ever , almost every trade between teams revolves around money . A player 's potential impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in most cases the redistribution of salaries  --  simple debit/credit trades  --  was a major factor during the flurry of trades completed before the deadline last Thursday . <p> And finally , there are decidedly mixed signals on whether the new system of revenue sharing and luxury taxes is creating more competitive balance on the field . Certainly it has not been a panacea to small-market teams everywhere . <p> In places like Cincinnati and Pittsburgh , where losing teams unloaded a number of well-paid , accomplished players last week , the perspective is that there has been no change in either finances or frustrating on-field performance . But in Kansas City , Minnesota and Florida , where the dumping of high-salaried players has almost been an annual rite of midsummer , there was near rejoicing . The Royals , the Twins and the Marlins are contending for the playoffs , and somewhat surprisingly , they kept their stars and even acquired additional players for playoff runs . Even the Montreal Expos , a small-market anomaly now owned by M.L.B. and destined to be moved fairly soon , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline . Instead , the Expos remain in contention for the National League wild-card spot . It may be that winning on the field , not the promise of future shared revenue , is what loosened the purse strings in these smaller markets . Which could lead the analysis of baseball 's new financial model to a familiar , chicken-and-egg debate . <p> " Incremental revenue sharing , even as it was distributed last off-season , has allowed some small-market teams to husband their resources and keep their teams together , " said Rob Manfred , M.L.B. 's executive vice president for labor relations and human resources . " That has helped them put together more competitive teams . The new agreement has not been around long enough to see a full-blown effect , but there are good signs it can bring about the intended change in the long term . " <p> Others are far from convinced . <p> " You do n't have to be a genius to see that when the Yankees can get Aaron Boone  --  when they are able to buy whoever they want  --  things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a telephone interview yesterday . " The incentive to change is not significant . If the idea was to hold down the Yankees ' spending or slow down the power of the big-market clubs , I do n't see that going on . " <p> J.P . Ricciardi , general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays , told The Associated Press last week , " It sounds like a repeat of the 50 's , where the Yankees used to go to the Kansas City A 's and take their players and give them money so they could survive . " <p> Under the collective bargaining agreement reached last August , baseball 's richest teams are expected to share with their less wealthy brethren much more than ever before . After the season , the total will be about $260 million , with the Yankees ' payout alone coming to nearly $60 million . <p> There is widespread suspicion , however , that this enhanced revenue sharing  --  intended to right the competitive imbalance between big-market and small-market teams  --  will have limited effect on the field , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than spend it on better players . Teams do not publicly release financial documents on how they spend the shared revenue . <p> " I believe the new system will work because I expect lower salaries and fewer lengthy big-time contracts , " said Richard G. Sheehan , an economist at Notre Dame who studies sports business . " But over all , I believe there is roughly the same amount of inequality across the board in baseball . Some poorer teams totally eschew the off-season free-agent market . They do pocket the money . " <p> Baseball has had a form of revenue sharing for several seasons , and with it had come unsubstantiated speculation of owners of smaller-market teams spending the extra revenue on everything from Christmas bonuses for front-office employees to expansion projects for unrelated businesses operated by the teams ' owners . <p> But Manfred , who helped negotiatethe new collective bargaining agreement last summer , said that it mandates , for the first time , that teams receiving shared revenue be audited to examine specifically how they have used the money . By April 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed accounting of how the revenue was spent and how these expenditures were intended to improve on-field performance . Manfred said Commissioner Bud Selig had the power to impose penalties on any team that did not submit the report or violated the expressed intent of baseball 's revenue sharing . <p> When it was suggested to Manfred that some baseball fans might not trust the accounting methods of some owners , he responded : " It 's hard to hide that money . Remember , the club owners do n't trust each other , either . " <p> Executives of some smaller-market teams , notably in Milwaukee and Pittsburgh , have said in the past that they were spending their shared revenue on improving their scouting and minor league systems . This is a time-honored way for teams to improve  --  through the amateur draft and by nurturing young players  --  but these days even that approach is not likely to level the playing field between baseball 's haves and have-nots . <p> Baseball 's amateur draft , weighted to give the poorest performing major league teams the chance to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highly rated players raised outside North America are being recruited by major league teams now , and finding the best foreign-born players in Asia or Latin America not only takes a bigger scouting budget , it takes more money to outbid competitors with outsized signing bonuses . <p> Also , some owners of smaller-market teams have privately accused their richer brethren of shielding millions in earnings to prevent the revenue from being shared . Since many bigger-market clubs also control the cable company that televises their games  --  a lucrative relationship that is at the core of baseball 's financial inequities  --  the contention is that some cable entities pay fees at below market rates to the teams . <p> " The big-market/small-market problem is the most intractable problem in baseball , " Vincent said . " I do n't see that changing . And without some level of competitive balance the game will be hurt . I love baseball , but I watch a lot of games and I see a large number of empty seats . I do believe the owners are acting more rationally , but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's just devastating to the fans of that club . <p> " I 've been saying it for years , the only answer is for the owners to let the players become partners in the game . " <p> The collective bargaining agreement , which runs through 2006 , calls for no such alliance . <p> " Let 's see how this system plays out , " Manfred said . " It is early . It can bear fruit .
