Silence . Darkness . A MAN walks onstage . Let 's give him a little light . There , that 's better . Now what ? Wait  --  I think he 's going to say something . Yes , he is . Good . MAN okay . This is how it goes . I mean , went . This is the way it all played out , or is going to . Or is right now . Does n't matter , you 'll figure it out . I think . No , you will sure you will ! No problem . ( Beat . ) What you need to know for now , I mean , right at this moment , is that there was a girl . ' Course there always is , is n't there ? I mean , unless there is n't . Then there 's not but that 's pretty self-explanatory . In this one , there 's a girl . There 's definitely a girl . Another light up . We need it  --  a WOMAN has just appeared . Sitting all alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN Huh . I think I 'm gon na go talk to her , because well , girls are nice . Basically . And that would be enough , but I need to  --  talk with her , I mean . To get this started . Or keep it going or whatever . You know what I 'm saying ! Sort of . And which is okay , because I only sort of know , too , at this point . ( Beat . ) Geez , I think I might end up being an unreliable narrator here The MAN starts to approach the WOMAN , who is seated on a bench . Moves next to her . p. 3 MAN hello . The WOMAN does n't react , and the MAN snaps his fingers , jumping back to his light spot . What 's up ? Let 's find out . MAN Just one other thing I know her . From before . Like , before now . So , whether this is happening or , umm , has happened , is all in my head  --  however that works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay ? Good I just wanted you to know . The MAN moves back over to the WOMAN . Taps her on the shoulder . MAN hello . The WOMAN turns , looks at him . It takes a moment , then she reacts . A lot . She even stands up . BELINDA PHIPPS Yes ? ( Beat . ) Oh my God oh-my-God ! Hey , hello . Hi ! MAN Hello . Again . BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah , again ! Way-way-back again . Wow . Hi ! Out of nowhere , a hug . Nice . Now we 're getting somewhere . The MAN hugs her right back . Of course . MAN I just saw you . Saw you sitting there and thought , " Hey . " I mean , more than that , more than just " Hey , " but that was first . " Hey . " You know ? " I know her . " p. 4 BELINDA PHIPPS Well , good . God , I hope it was more than that ! MAN No , it was , yeah , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it ! I ca n't believe you 're just I mean , standing there . Right outside of MAN Sears . I know , funny , right ? BELINDA PHIPPS No , more than ! It 's weird after , what , like , ten years ? To see MAN It 's twelve . Yeah . Almost twelve years . The WOMAN looks at him again . We might need more light now  --  some " Sears " light . She gives him another hug . BELINDA PHIPPS Wow . Really ? It 's just wow . About twelve years . MAN Yep . A dozen of ' em . BELINDA PHIPPS That 's kinda weird . MAN Yeah , but not so weird , right ? Not like we knew each other super well or anything They stand looking at each other for a moment . A voice on the mall intercom interrupts them . They look up , waiting . Then talk again . MAN I just mean it 's okay , too , is n't it ? To meet again . p. 5 BELINDA PHIPPS Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ! It is . It 's fantastic , but , you know yeah . It is weird . MAN Uh-huh . It definitely has a " weird " flavor .

BELINDA PHIPPS No , not so much different , ' cause I could recognize you , like , almost instantly . But you 're , I du n no MAN What ?

And then , I du n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my kitchen ! p. 6 BELINDA PHIPPS Right right !

The commercial at the drive-in ( He demonstrates . ) " Two-fisted style ! " BELINDA PHIPPS I remember that yes ! MAN Yeah , it was always right after the dancing candy and soda pop one ( Beat . ) I mean I think we even went to the movies once , there at the outdoor place that one time . Did n't we ? BELINDA PHIPPS did we ? MAN Yeah , I think . Remember ? Over at the with the paddle-wheel ship out front  --  what was that called ? The BELINDA PHIPPS Showboat ? MAN Yes ! That 's it some crazy double feature that we all went to . This group of us . You do n't recall that ? BELINDA PHIPPS Ummmm , no , I do I think I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The MAN steps away for a minute . Toward us. p. 7 MAN I do n't think she does . Not really . I mean , she may say she can , remember us going there , but I do n't believe it . Girls generally go on more dates and stuff than us guys do at that age , sixteen or so , and that 's probably why it 's harder to dredge up specific memories . That might be it . ' Cause it really is like yesterday for me . Seriously . It is The MAN walks back over to her  --  she 's still thinking . Looks kind of lost while she does this . BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah , I think I do , actually . Yes . It was , like , a comedy or some was n't it ? MAN Ahh , it was , no . It was Dances with Wolves , I think . And then another one BELINDA PHIPPS Oh ( frowns ) Well , that had some funny parts did n't it ? MAN A couple . Maybe the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHIPPS Yeah , that could be it . MAN Right , sure ( Beat . ) So , is that place still open ? BELINDA PHIPPS What the Showboat ? MAN Yeah . BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , no no way ! There 's , like , a mall there now or something . Strip mall  --  where they have stores but you walk outside . Is that what they call ' em ? p. 8 MAN Uh-huh . I think so I mean , sometimes they come up with a fancier name  --  Oakbrook Commons or whatnot  --  but that 's basically what they are . Strip malls . This long " strip " of stores BELINDA PHIPPS Huh . Well , that was maybe eight years ago they did that . Put in the strip there . ( Beat . ) How long since you 've been back ? MAN Oh , you know BELINDA PHIPPS Umm , no , not really . MAN No , I mean , I was n't finished sorry . I guess , around , ahh , maybe five years . Well , one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  missed a connection , so I was there for a couple hours  --  but five years , more or less . BELINDA PHIPPS wow . ( smiles ) Hmmm . MAN What ?

BELINDA PHIPPS To talk , I mean . About , you know whatever . Just have a five-minute conversation with a person MAN Why , is your husband a mute ? The WOMAN looks at him strangely for a moment , without speaking . The MAN clears his throat . p. 10 MAN I just God , I hope not ! I was kidding . I saw your ring , noticed it , and that 's all . ( Beat . ) He can speak , ca n't he ? BELINDA PHIPPS rumor has it . Not to me , of course , but I know he must . Every so often MAN Ahh . One of those , huh ? BELINDA PHIPPS Yep . He 's a classic . Classic guy MAN Ouch . From all of us . BELINDA PHIPPS No , sorry , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go on like one of those people that you run into at , like MAN Sears . BELINDA PHIPPS Exactly ! The WOMAN laughs again  --  it 's a good sound . Then another hug . MAN People 're gon na start to talk BELINDA PHIPPS That 's okay . Let ' em ! Have n't seen you in ten years , so let them say stuff if they want to MAN Twelve . It was twelve years . BELINDA PHIPPS Right . Even better The WOMAN lets this thought hang , glancing at her watch . She reacts. p. 11 BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , damn can you hold on a sec ? I need to I 'm getting a couple keys cut , I need to grab them before five . Just one minute Before the MAN can respond , the WOMAN scurries off . Just disappears . Let 's leave the lights up for a bit . I think she 'll be back  --  I think we can trust her . MAN how great is that ? Huh ? I came in here for the baseball card shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn nice , I mean am I being too obvious ? ' Cause I really liked her back in school , junior year  --  hell , even as a senior , she was in my honors English class . And civics , too , I think . Yeah . God , she was something else ( remembering ) I used to sit there and watch her , watch her lips moving as she read along with the teacher when we were doing The Scarlet Letter . ( Beat . ) I know she 's married and all , probably got kids , even , but hey , I 'm just saying . Whatever . ' S just a little history . And then the WOMAN returns . I told you she would . A small envelope of keys in one hand . BELINDA PHIPPS hi . Sorry about that . MAN Not a problem . ( points ) You lock yourself out or something ? p. 12 BELINDA PHIPPS What , these ? No it 's for a , we have an apartment . Over the garage . A garage apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment that 's above your garage ? BELINDA PHIPPS Sorry ! Yes now look who 's being thorough ! And obvious MAN Right ! Thought I was bad BELINDA PHIPPS Uh-huh . Forgive me comes from being around a two-year-old . MAN Yours ? BELINDA PHIPPS Of course a boy . MAN No , I did n't mean like you stole him or anything , just you could be a teacher , for all I know . BELINDA PHIPPS Well , that 's true . I 'm not , but I could be could 've been a lot of things , but I 'm the mother of a great little two-year-old . MAN plus , a wife . BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah . That , too . MAN And married a mute ! Not many people can claim that That laugh again from the WOMAN . The MAN laughs , too . Lots of laughs from these two . p. 13 BELINDA PHIPPS No , guess not ! Not very loudly , anyway ( Beat . ) Get if ? If I was mute , I could n't forget it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's true . Sorry . MAN I said you married a mute as far as I 'm concerned , you 're perfect . Big pause right here  --  some cards have just been thrown on the table . The WOMAN is about to respond , thinks better of it , then looks in the little envelope and counts her keys . BELINDA PHIPPS Anyway we 've got this thing , this space over the second garage , and we fixed it up . To rent . MAN nice . Yeah , I 'm coking for a place myself . ( Beat . ) So two garages . huh ?

Because no , I just thought that 'd be nice . To see you again . At the Wal-Mart there , or MAN Shoe Carnival BELINDA PHIPPS Exactly ! That would make me happy . To do that . And there 's one of those over there , too , so MAN Well , we 're damn near obligated , then , are n't we ? ( laughs ) I mean , we could we can make that happen , I suppose .

Come on ! I ca n't believe she went and no , that 's not true . I guess you can believe whatever happens in life  --  there 's actually very little that is unbelievable . And I 'd heard that they were but that 's way out there . Cody Phipps . Not that he was n't , you know , popular and stuff , or good-looking , that type of thing and that dude could run ! Damn could he He was amazing . Not fast , not so much that , like a lotta those guys are he did n't sprint or anything . No , Cody did all the distances . He would kill you in the long haul , just totally wear you down , then fly right past you 800. 1,200 . The 1,500 . Cross-country in the fall , which sorta pissed people off because he was great at football , too , but nothing he liked more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runner , I mean . When you like something , a sport , or do a pastime like that , you hardly ever just give it up . Forget about it . The lights change to some sort of restaurant . Now there are a table and some chair  --  I did n't even notice them before . p. 20 MAN Why do n't we just go meet the guy ? Save a little time . You know , I could talk all night or however long we 're gon na be here about Cody Phipps  --  longer about Belinda  --  but if we were to meet him , just take a second and get acquainted I think it 'd start to help pull this thing all together for you . Okay ? Cool The MAN walks over to one of the chairs , sits . Not long after ANOTHER MAN walks in . About the same age . A black guy . He motions toward a WAITRESS in the distance . MAN hello , Cody.

Some things he does n't like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're not rich , we just , you know take advantage of the ignorant middle class , that 's all ! ( Beat . ) ' S true take away all the Ralph Lauren and shit , they 'd only be hardware stores . BELINDA PHIPPS comfortable . That 's what we are . MAN Huh . Anyhow , I do look different . BELINDA PHIPPS You really do . CODY PHIPPS You 're not so fat , right ? Silence . Then the MAN bursts out laughing  --  the WOMAN turns white . Whiter than she already is . BELINDA PHIPPS Cody CODY PHIPPS What ? That 's it , is n't it ? What 's the matter with the truth ? p. 22 MAN No , you 're right , that 's pretty much it . I was fatter . CODY PHIPPS ' S my point . No big deal . MAN Very true . ( to the WOMAN ) I thought you said the guy did n't talk much . Another silence . The MAN means it as a joke , but it obviously stings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just meant that you know CODY PHIPPS You say that ? BELINDA PHIPPS I was n't we were talking about school and all , and I CODY PHIPPS Shit . ( to the MAN ) I talk . I just do n't overtalk MAN Got it . See , now , this is the Cody I remember . He always had plenty to say CODY PHIPPS Still do , man . I always do . Just say it in my own time On that , CODY raises a hand to try and catch the eye of the passing WAITRESS . She does n't even pause . CODY nods , turns back to the others . CODY PHIPPS somebody else might as well try it , ' cause she ai n't coming over here for me . ( Beat . ) Does n't matter how many shops I open in the area , I 'm flat outta luck when it comes to gettin ' some service p. 23 BELINDA PHIPPS Honey , I do n't think she saw you . CODY PHIPPS ' Course she did . She totally saw me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something MAN Nah I think this place always had bad service . CODY PHIPPS Yeah ? When 'd you eat here last ? MAN Good point . A decade or so BELINDA PHIPPS It 's okay , I can The WOMAN starts to stand , gets to her feet even , before CODY places a hand on her wrist . A firm hand . CODY PHIPPS Just sit .

What 's wrong with that ? Words only have power if you let ' em MAN Good point . Right . The WAITRESS is moving past again . The MAN practically stands up to get her attention . She stops at the table . p. 25 MAN hi there . Hey . Could we get , umm , well , just a Coke for me , no ice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's okay . CODY PHIPPS ' Course it 's okay , we 're gon na pay for it , are n't we ? ( to WAITRESS ) And now that you 're here water . She nods and wanders off toward the kitchen . Well , backstage , actually , but we 'll pretend there 's a kitchen . MAN I think you made a friend . CODY PHIPPS Shit BELINDA PHIPPS That 's all Cody drinks is water . Ever since I 've known him . MAN Yeah ? CODY PHIPPS Pretty much . ' S good stuff . " Pure . Clean . Feeds the machine . " That 's what my dad told me , anyway MAN and it rhymes , which is cool . CODY PHIPPS You 're kind of a smart-ass , are n't ya ? Like , a jokester . MAN Just a little bit . CODY PHIPPS I think I do remember you now . We had P.E . together or something traded a few rookie cards once . p. 26 MAN Yep . That 's right . CODY PHIPPS You could play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And " a little " would be stretching it .

BELINDA PHIPPS We never played it I mean , over on the girls ' side of the gym . I think we did a gymnastics unit at that point , or maybe volleyball MAN Huh . A silence seeps into the proceedings . Smiles between the MAN and WOMAN . CODY looks around for the drinks . MAN so , Cody , you still a runner ? CODY PHIPPS Yep . Every day . MAN Great . BELINDA PHIPPS Ten miles CODY PHIPPS Not always . Sometimes I got ta get into the office early , but usually I can burn up ten by breakfast . MAN Wow .

CODY PHIPPS Fun ? MAN Sort of . Got hooked on it ( Beat . ) We should go sometime . CODY PHIPPS I do n't do nothing for fun . BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , come on ( to the MAN ) That is not true .

CODY PHIPPS Yeah , but it 's no . It 's helping out . I mean , yes , I like it , but I do n't do it for fun . I coach a few runners , that 's not , like , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give a little back CODY PHIPPS that would imply that they gave me something in the first place . MAN Touch . The two men look at each other  --  a smile between them . It 's one of those guy things ; better just leave it be . BELINDA PHIPPS What about your golf ? CODY PHIPPS Please that 's business . I do that ' cause these Midwestern dudes love it , so out I go once they let me on the course , I mean . CODY seems happy to pursue this subject when the WAITRESS returns , dropping off the drinks . Not a word out of her . MAN she seems very sweet . BELINDA PHIPPS Right ! ( laughs ) A lovely young woman . CODY PHIPPS Yeah , de-light-ful . The MAN smiles at this and takes a sip . So does the WOMAN . CODY looks around the restaurant as the MAN suddenly stands . MAN I think this is Diet . Lemme run it up front , it 'll be faster . CODY PHIPPS Give ' em hell p. 29 MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) If my head was shaved , you could see the pins and everything ! ( Beat . ) You know , the movie with the guy who 's all I 'll be right back . The MAN smiles and moves back into his original light . Looks out at us . MAN I got ta be honest . That was a total line I just threw out there , the Diet Coke thing . Yeah . See , I thought it was getting a little bit uncomfortable , did n't you ? Uh-huh . Kind of , anyway . So I just wanted to take a sec and regroup here The MAN looks back over at CODY and the WOMAN . They sit in silence , maybe a perfunctory word or two . MAN Is it me , or does he seem a little pissed off ? I totally get that vibe from him . Pissed right off about something . ( Beat . ) He did n't always use to be that way , not when I knew him , anyhow . Not that we were , like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him enough enough to say that much about him , and he never seemed so keyed up like this . I mean , maybe after his mom left , for a while there he was kinda you know . How you get when that sort of thing happens . You 're just cruising along and then , wham ! Life gets , like , all shitty . Matter of minutes I think that 's what happened to him . And , thing is , she 'd do it about every other month . Plus there 's the whole race thing not that he made a huge deal about it at school , but yeah , he pulled that card out a few times back then . Just once or twice a day ! Nobody really called him on it , but it was completely obvious when he 'd do it . School lunch line , picking teams for gym , when some girl or other would n't go out with him like , whenever he needed some excuse , basically . We used to call it the ol ' " Ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , God no , you kidding ? Cody was , well , you know kinda fierce . Pretty serious when he wanted to be , so no . We 'd say it when we were alone , just a few of the guys . Say , like , " Hey , Cody just whipped out the Ace ' a Spades . " And that 's when somebody 'd say , one of my friends would " Just got ta call a spade a spade . " ( smiles ) We were only just joking , but it was pretty funny . At the time The MAN looks to us for validation  --  does he get any ? Well , we 'll have to see . For now let 's imagine that it remains silent out there . He nods , then turns back toward the table . p. 30 MAN I 'm gon na head back over now new drink would n't really take all that long to get , right ? The MAN nods to us , then turns and moves back to his chair . Sipping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . CODY PHIPPS Yeah ? Looks like the same thing MAN Well , it 's a Coke glass . They all have the same kind of CODY PHIPPS No , the color of it . Seems a little light , like the last one did . MAN Huh . No , it 's BELINDA PHIPPS Does it taste okay ? MAN Yeah !

You miss this place ? MAN I do . CODY PHIPPS Huh . BELINDA PHIPPS That 's nice . You know ? To miss the town where you people do n't care enough about their roots , I do n't think . MAN I agree . It 's easy to forget what 's important . Where you come from . BELINDA PHIPPS I know , it really is . Roots CODY PHIPPS What do you mean by that ? MAN I think she 's saying you should move back to Africa Big silence on this one . Remember how I said there are certain things CODY does n't like ? This would be one of them . p. 32 CODY PHIPPS man . that is not cool . MAN It 's a joke . ( Beat . ) I mean , come on , Cody , I was just words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BELINDA PHIPPS Honey I do n't think he meant to  --  CODY PHIPPS No. her whatever . Come to meet a guy , allow him to move into my home , and he insults me , that 's fine . If you do n't mind that , ho-ney , then that 's fine MAN I did n't it was n't meant as a hurtful thing . God , no ! I was just trying to be funny . ( Beat . ) Sorry . BELINDA PHIPPS I think we 're all just a little tense . Nervous . CODY PHIPPS I 'm not nervous , why would I be nervous ? Hmm ? BELINDA PHIPPS I du n no , maybe you know . CODY PHIPPS No . I do n't know . I 've got this nice new studio over my garage , and I 'm looking for a tenant . Not some asshole . MAN Cody , honestly forgive me . It was just a she said " roots , " and it popped into my head . That 's  --  CODY PHIPPS Oh . MAN The show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times and , you know , that dancer somebody Vereen . ( Beat . ) There was no disrespect meant . It was a mistake p. 33 CODY PHIPPS Fine . BELINDA PHIPPS It 's okay . CODY PHIPPS Hey . ( looks at WOMAN ) Do n't you do that . Do n't apologize for me , or go saying that something is okay . Got that ? Do-not . I said it was fine , not that it was okay . Big , big difference BELINDA PHIPPS I 'm sorry . Cody , please , I  --  MAN What 's the difference ? CODY PHIPPS What ? MAN No , I mean , you said something about the difference between " fine " and " okay , " and I 'm trying to think what it is . CODY PHIPPS Dude , just leave it . MAN All right . Just trying to BELINDA PHIPPS Why do n't we CODY PHIPPS You know what " okay " means , means that it 's okay . It 's all all right . And " fine " is something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm letting it go . Fine . But it is not o-kay . They all take long , uncomfortable sips from their beverages . The WAITRESS passes again . Oblivious . Does n't see CODY raise his hand . CODY PHIPPS and that shit is not " okay , " either ! What is it with her ? p. 34 MAN You got me . ( Beat . ) Do you need something ? BELINDA PHIPPS She 's probably trying to cover too many tables I used to work here back whenever , in school . ( to the men ) Do you remember that ? MAN Depends . Do you remember me sitting in that corner booth there , almost every day after school ? BELINDA PHIPPS I do . With your homework . MAN Yep ! CODY PHIPPS I never came in here . Least not back then , anyhow . And not after school . I had sports MAN Right , ' course you did . CODY PHIPPS Yeah . BELINDA PHIPPS It was always quiet then , around four or so , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipping on a drink . MAN Uh-huh . And probably a basket of cheese fries , too ! I was a porker in those days God . CODY PHIPPS Yep . You were kind of a tubby sorta guy then , were n't you ? MAN Oh yeah . CODY PHIPPS And with the wise mouth , too . p. 35 MAN You are correct , sir . CODY PHIPPS Surprised you did n't get picked on more beat up and shit . MAN I got my share , do n't worry . There was plenty of that BELINDA PHIPPS That 's awful . MAN Nah , made me a better person . It 's what I told myself , anyway , lying there in traction BELINDA PHIPPS Oh my God . ( Beat . ) Really ? CODY PHIPPS No , that 's bullshit . MAN ' Course it is . But I did get a few bumps in my day the occasional undies up the flagpole . CODY laughs at this , the first time we 've heard that . It seems out of place , almost frightening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! CODY PHIPPS No , man , sorry , but , I can remember it . Seriously . Seeing your Fruit of the Looms flapping up there , all the way down by the track ! Certain times that was funny . CODY laughs halfheartedly again , but it 's passed now . Over . CODY PHIPPS Anyway , whatever . So what 's the deal ? You want the place or not ? p. 36 MAN Ummm BELINDA PHIPPS Honey , he 'd probably like to see it first . ( to the MAN ) Right ? MAN Yeah , that 'd be  --  CODY PHIPPS Why ? I mean , it 's new . All the stuff in there is new , so what 's the problem ? MAN Nothing , no , just that it 's , you know furnished . CODY PHIPPS So ? MAN So , I 'd like to see if my things 'll go with I du n no . The carpet CODY PHIPPS Oh . Okay , fine , if you 're like that about it , all particular , then okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BELINDA PHIPPS It 's pretty nice . We did it all in neutrals . You know , with whites and creams and that sort of  --  MAN Great . I 'll take a look . And it 's how much six-fifty ? CODY PHIPPS Yep . ( Beat . ) I was planning to knock it down if somebody wanted to do a little yard work for me BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , we never  --  CODY PHIPPS I know , I know , I 'm joking ! I can joke , too , ca n't I ? p. 37 MAN Sure . No , I 'd make a hell of an indentured servant you 're right . CODY PHIPPS I 'm not talking about no servant . If you do some gardening , you get paid . That 's all . ( to the WOMAN ) Did the same thing with that one student , the exchange student . Remember ? The WOMAN nods , then takes a sip . Quiet for a moment . That 's okay , they all need a breather . MAN Sure . I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Beat . ) Beggars ca n't be well , you know . CODY PHIPPS Exactly . MAN Great . BELINDA PHIPPS Well , that 's really nice we can set a time to take a look later . MAN Perfect . CODY PHIPPS and why 're you here again ? Back in town , I mean ? MAN Just , you know getting back to basics . Simplifying . ( Beat . ) Was n't so big on the corporate thing , all the wheeling and dealing I had to do , that sorta stuff . I 'm no lawyer , that 's what I found out . ' Course , I had to go to law school and take on about seventy thousand in loans to figure it out , but hey ! They all chuckle at this  --  kind of vacantly , but they 're trying . p. 38 MAN Anyhow , I 'm cutting back , gon na do some writing that I always wanted to do , and BELINDA PHIPPS That sounds good CODY PHIPPS Sort of like that Grisham , huh ? MAN What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that , right ? Stopped being a lawyer and became a writer . MAN Uh-huh . Yes , like that . Except for the theater I 'm gon na be a  --  CODY PHIPPS Well , that 's cool lawyers are pretty good at making shit up . I know mine are ! ( laughs ) Great . BELINDA PHIPPS that 's exciting MAN Yep . Might have to sell a bit of my card collection for cash , but CODY PHIPPS Yeah seriously ? MAN Maybe . Thought I 'd CODY PHIPPS You still got that Jackie Robinson you took off me ? Huh ? MAN Hey , I did n't " take " it off you , you traded it CODY PHIPPS Yes , but p. 39 MAN Fair and square . ( to the WOMAN ) Guy is still sore about that ! CODY PHIPPS ' S my favorite card . MAN Then you should 've kept it CODY PHIPPS Right . BELINDA PHIPPS What is it a baseball card ? MAN Uh-huh . It 's one he gave me back in school . For a favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asking for help from somebody CODY PHIPPS Yeah , well , I needed it . ( Beat . ) It was a sweet card , too . MAN I know . 1952 Topps . Mint condition . ( to the WOMAN again ) You know why there are so few Robinson cards from that time ? BELINDA PHIPPS Uh-uh . Why ? CODY PHIPPS Because people destroyed ' em . Dads , their kids , folks would get them  --  white folks , that is  --  find them in their gum pack and rip the fuck out of ' em because the dude was a black man , this uppity black who somehow snuck his way onto a ball team that is why . Guys across America were tearing his picture up to show that they did not like it . Rookie of the year , MVP , they still did n't give a shit . And that 's why it 's so damn rare p. 40 BELINDA PHIPPS and that 's why you want it ? CODY PHIPPS You do n't get it . ( to the MAN ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN That 's okay . It 's pretty much a guy thing ( to the WOMAN ) It 's not just that , anyway . This one had a flaw in it . ' S a misprint that  --  CODY PHIPPS Whatever . ( Beat . ) You serious about it , I 'll swing a deal with you . MAN Maybe . I 'm probably gon na need to do something actually , as long as I can pay the child support , I 'm okay BELINDA PHIPPS Oh . Oh ! I was n't I mean , I did n't know you had kids . That 's great . MAN Kid . Just the one . A girl . CODY PHIPPS Where 's she at ? MAN My daughter ? Oh , she 's , you know , with her mom . CODY PHIPPS Man , I could never give up my kids . This reference is caught by the MAN  --  he and the WOMAN should share a brief look  --  before he goes on . MAN I did n't give ' er up I see her all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complicated , I 'm sure . Always is . Raising kids is n't complicated , you ai n't doing it right ( Beat . ) But hey , that 's your business . CODY stands , stretches , then puts out a hand . CODY PHIPPS I got ta go , need to swing past the store over on Tamarack . Replaced a manager , so The MAN stands , along with the WOMAN . CODY and his wife hold a look for a moment . CODY PHIPPS Good to see you . And look , you two work out a time to check the place and make a decision or not on the , you know , carpet ( shakes hands with the MAN ) See ya . MAN Yeah , you , too . BELINDA PHIPPS Bye , sweetie . ( They kiss . ) Talk to you later . CODY nods as he drops a wad of cash on the table . Exits . MAN Well . That was huh . BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah . Sorry . MAN No , totally fine , just not what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute BELINDA PHIPPS I know . Yes . MAN So " kids , " huh ? You did n't say that before . Kids . How come ? p. 42 BELINDA PHIPPS Oh . you know because . MAN No. why ? BELINDA PHIPPS because he hates me . Cody Jr . He 's six , and he pretty much hates me . ( Beat . ) I 'll just pay for the The WOMAN tries to smile but just misses pulling it off . She grabs the money and heads to the counter . The MAN is alone . MAN anyway , it was more or less like that . I 'm not completely sure she said his name then , her other son 's , but she might 've . Probably did . And , so that 's how I got into the apartment over the garage . I mean , I may 've walked her out to her car , or am going to  --  I still do n't get the time thing here !  --  but it basically happened that way . Cody all tense and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Her , too . Belinda , I mean . Yeah , I get the feeling that she needs to stay out of the way a lot or , as she said earlier ( or will later a lot a lot . Yeah Lights need to pop up now on another playing area  --  turns out we 're going to need a few . This one should be some kind of nice sitting-room area . Just a few pieces to suggest it . We 'll fake the rest . MAN We should probably keep moving now . Most of you 'll need to get on home after this , right ? I 'm sure you do . Even if you have no one to get home to , you still need to get there Okay good . Now , I 'm not going to be in this next bit , I mean , I will in spirit or whatever , because I 'll be talked about , things like that , but I wo n't actually be there . Do n't worry , though , no big deal , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the apartment there fixing my lunch or reading some book , that kind of thing . Making notes . I may even have myself a little job by this point  --  I do end up helping out with the yard work  --  so , something along those lines . But this part right now is pretty important to the rest , so do pay attention ' Kay ? Fine . ( Beat . ) If you do n't , you 'll never find out how Belinda ends up with the black guy " eye , " I mean " black eye " ! Geez , that 's a Freudian slip , huh ? ( chuckles ) Like I said , I was n't there , so I did n't see it  --  or wo n't  --  but you get to see it all . If you pay attention . All I know is later , when Cody 's out at the office , she comes to me , and I see it and freak out a bit , but she never actually tells me about what happened . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it goes . This part . Okay , I 'll shut up now The MAN smiles and backs off , disappearing just as the WOMAN enters . She plops onto the couch after putting a baby monitor down on the coffee table . Sorry  --  yeah , we 'll need a coffee table , too . She has a magazine and a diet cola with her . p. 43 BELINDA PHIPPS hello ? ( Beat . ) I 'm in here ! CODY PHIPPS ( offstage ) Why ? Why 're you in there ? BELINDA PHIPPS I just because . CODY enters , drenched in sweat from working out . Nike shirt , shorts . Maybe even wearing sunglasses . He looks pretty cool . CODY PHIPPS ' Cause why ? Huh ? Why do you always hole up in this room , way the other side of the house ? BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , I like it in here . It 's sunny during the morning , and I can relax a minute when the baby 's asleep CODY PHIPPS Hey , he 's not a baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a baby , but he 's not . BELINDA PHIPPS Listen , he needs to  --  CODY PHIPPS No , you listen . What he does n't need is taking a nap at eight in the morning ! All right ? He just got up , like , an hour and a half ago . And you give ' im breakfast and back to bed he goes that 's wrong . BELINDA PHIPPS He 's tired . He 's  --  CODY PHIPPS No , you 're lazy , that 's what it is. p. 44 BELINDA PHIPPS " Lazy " ? CODY PHIPPS You heard me . Yeah . You get Cody Jr . off to school  --  great  --  and put a little food down Ralph , and then that 's it for the day , far as you think BELINDA PHIPPS That is not CODY PHIPPS Bullshit ! Bull-shit . I know it is . BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , our son is tired , do you mind ? I know you do n't get that way , since you run every day and never come to bed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we sleep . He 's a child . A growing boy , and he needs a nap whenever he feels like it . Right now , an hour from now whenever . CODY shakes his head and pulls off his shirt , flexing . Does a few stretches . Yes , he 's in good shape . CODY PHIPPS That shit is abuse BELINDA PHIPPS What ? ! I mean , why would you even say ? CODY PHIPPS It is ! You ever hear of raising children ? Huh ? You raise them , they do n't do it themselves You 're the parent , you set the rules , make the choices . Not the kid . BELINDA PHIPPS And when was the last time you took part in that ? " Raising " him . Hmm ? p. 45 CODY PHIPPS Do n't start that crap I work . BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , please CODY PHIPPS What ? ! I do , ' s more than you can say . BELINDA PHIPPS Cody ! I mean CODY PHIPPS hey , truth hurts . BELINDA PHIPPS ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something . CODY PHIPPS The fuck does that mean ? BELINDA PHIPPS that 's kinda Victorian , do n't you think ? " I work . " I mean , come on we both work , I just happen to work here . In this house of yours . I mean , your father 's  --  CODY PHIPPS It 's my house . My house . ' Kay ? He 's dead and this is mine . Including this room here , which you know I hate you being in BELINDA PHIPPS Why ? ! CODY PHIPPS Because it 's a sitting room , okay ? " Sitting . " Supposed to be for the evening , or when you have guests over BELINDA PHIPPS No , it 's not . CODY PHIPPS Yeah , it is . Yes ! You go read one of those Architectural Digests or something I have in the den , it 'll tell you the same damn thing p. 46 BELINDA PHIPPS Who cares ? CODY PHIPPS I do . I care ! You sitting in here , middle of the morning , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink all the time looks lazy . You look like a fuckin ' pig , and I hate it ! BELINDA PHIPPS Wow . Okay , that 's well , that 's a new one . I mean , you 've usually got something lousy to say to me , but that there is a completely new one . Congratulations CODY PHIPPS Shut up . BELINDA PHIPPS Nice comeback CODY PHIPPS Fuck that . I do n't need a comeback . I need a wife who does n't park it on her fat ass all day , sucking on pop like she 's some sixteen-year-old BELINDA PHIPPS I wish I was . CODY PHIPPS What ? BELINDA PHIPPS That . Sixteen CODY PHIPPS Yean. why 's that ? BELINDA PHIPPS because that was the year before I met you . Okay ? That 's why She can see CODY react at this , but she ca n't stop now . Not very wise , maybe , but that 's how it goes sometimes . p. 47 CODY PHIPPS well , well . BELINDA PHIPPS Co-dy I 'm just saying ( thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? Back whenever , But now , I mean , now you 're just so worried about somebody giving you shit . or disrespecting you , or I do n't know what and it 's not about that . Black or white or any of that crap . it 's about being a good guy , Cody . A decent person . And you 're not in the end , I 'm with somebody who 's like all the other guys I grew up around . Not so terrible , but not very good , either . You 're just a guy . Just a normal guy which means kind of shitty , actually . Completely average and a little bit shitty . CODY tenses up , turns to her . He starts to advance slowly , wrapping shirt around his hand  --  like a boxer wraps tape around his fist before putting it in the glove . The WOMAN stands , facing him . CODY PHIPPS ' S that right ? BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , look I did n't mean CODY PHIPPS Is it ? Great . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't CODY PHIPPS No , that 's funny . You 're getting real cute with your mouth lately . Must be your little friend over the garage there , making you all clever and smarty-pants like that p. 48 BELINDA PHIPPS He has n't been no . I was just trying to say that  --  CODY PHIPPS make another wish . Go ahead one more . CODY continues to move toward her as she backs away . Finally , she comes up against a love seat and is trapped . She looks at him , shit scared . I mean , come on , would n't you be ? She tries to reach out and touch him . CODY pulls back . The WOMAN is starting to cry . Shaking her head . CODY PHIPPS Go on make one . BELINDA PHIPPS I wish you would n't hurt me . CODY PHIPPS Huh . ( Beat . ) Too late CODY smacks her flat in the stomach , doubling her over . She drops to her knees and disappears behind the small couch . He reaches down and hits her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see exactly what happens , but the sound is sickening . For a moment , silence . Then the sound of a child waking up on the baby monitor . CODY unwraps his hand and starts off . CODY PHIPPS I 'll get ' im . ( Beat . ) You better put something on that eye . Try your soda pop there that 's nice and cold . CODY exits . The room is empty , the WOMAN still behind the piece of furniture . After a moment , the MAN enters the room . What 's he doing here again ? p. 49 MAN okay , so maybe it was n't exactly like that . I du n no . Hey , look , I 'm a writer  --  would-be writer , anyway  --  so , what can I tell ya ? I 've got a hell of an imagination , and I just go with it sometimes listen , it could 've happened that way ! Easily  --  I mean , she did get the eye once , this black eye , and so , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably how I want it to be , like , so I can jump in there , save her or whatever . That 's probably it but still , this might 've been a touch of an exaggeration . Yeah . Anyway , all stories need some sort of antagonist , do n't they ? Sure . Someone to dislike , or you want to see fail or whatever well , I figure I 'm gon na have to play the ol ' Ace ' a Spades on that one ! Yep . Only choice I 've got I mean , it ca n't be me . And not her , I do n't want it to be her , so Cody 's the guy . ( Beat . ) But to be fair , I have no idea if it happened that way or not . The bruise thingie . No that was probably a bit much , we should go ahead and give it another try . Suddenly , the WOMAN walks back into the room  --  how did she get out there ? Well , it should seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical trick . A trapdoor or something . Anyhow , she walks back in , same as before , except this time holding the Tab can to her eye and carrying the magazine . She sets down the baby monitor and plops onto the couch . p. 50 MAN What I 'm saying is , this is the way she described it to me , Belinda did , after it occurred . But , see , umm , I did n't really believe her I mean , she swears it was this way , she does , but something seems a little off about it , and so that 's why I made up the other story . The first one . Look , you decide for yourselves . ( Beat . ) Anyway , sorry about that . Told you before that you should n't totally trust me on any of this ! The MAN smiles and exits . After a moment , the WOMAN calls out . BELINDA PHIPPS hello ? ( Beat . ) I 'm in here . CODY PHIPPS ( offstage ) Why ? Why 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CODY walks in , back from a run . Dressed the same as before but not nearly as sweaty . Wearing the sunglasses up on his head . He moves over toward his wife . CODY PHIPPS hey . Hey . What happened ? BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , nothing , no , I just I left the cupboard door open and CODY PHIPPS Baby , oww . Ouuw ! Lemme see He crouches beside her , lifting the soda can to have a peek at his wife 's condition . p. 51 CODY PHIPPS Damn BELINDA PHIPPS Bad ? CODY PHIPPS Mmm-hmm . Gon na be BELINDA PHIPPS Great . ( touches it ) Ouuuh CODY PHIPPS Hey , I 'm the one who should be grumpy the person who 's gon na suffer is me . The shit I 'll get for this 'll be unbelievable BELINDA PHIPPS S'pose so . ( Beat . ) Good CODY PHIPPS People 'll be saying I smacked you one . They totally will ( Beat . ) " Black man goes on rampage , " shit like that . CODY laughs at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . He reaches over and kisses her gently . CODY PHIPPS There . Daddy 'll make it all better . BELINDA PHIPPS Mmmmm CODY PHIPPS You should probably use some ice , though . Honey ? You should . Way more helpful than that soda pop BELINDA PHIPPS I know , but CODY PHIPPS You want me to get some ? p. 52 BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah , but in a minute . ' Kay ? CODY PHIPPS Sure . CODY pulls off his sweaty shirt and stretches  --  still looks good . He plops down on the couch near her , lifting up her legs and then pulling them onto his lap . She smiles . BELINDA PHIPPS Thanks ( Beat . ) So , how 're your protgs coming ? CODY PHIPPS Hmmm ? Oh , they 're , you know do n't know if they 'll make state , but working hard . BELINDA PHIPPS That 's good .

BELINDA PHIPPS Uh-uh . Not usually I mean , not if you 've just been out with the team . Timing them or whatever . CODY , exasperated , throws his shirt on the end of the couch . Comes over and hovers , leaning in dangerously close to her . CODY PHIPPS Look BELINDA PHIPPS I 'm just saying just saying it , that 's all . CODY PHIPPS Well , do n't , okay ?

BELINDA PHIPPS That 's great CODY PHIPPS You take the hand you 're dealt , ' s what my old man always said , and so I did it . And you , sweetness , were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really do n't know what the hell you just said , but I 'm sure it means something to you CODY PHIPPS You know exactly what I 'm saying BELINDA PHIPPS No , Cody , I do n't . I really do n't . CODY moves closer to the WOMAN . Towering over her . She tries to hold her own , but hey , let 's be honest . This guy can be a bit unnerving . CODY PHIPPS I 'm saying that , had I been mature enough in high school to see past your bangs and your cute little cheerleader skirt , shit like that I probably would n't be standing here , having this stupid fucking talk with you . Because you would not be in my house BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah ? Well , I am now but you can go . Just tell me when and I 'll help you pack up , have you outta here in under an hour . p. 58 CODY PHIPPS I am not going nowhere . BELINDA PHIPPS Well , that 's a double negative , but I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet you do at that . And I get yours BELINDA PHIPPS and so there we are . Same lousy place we usually find ourselves at . CODY PHIPPS Yep . BELINDA PHIPPS Great . That 's really great CODY starts off but stops , catching himself . Simmering . CODY PHIPPS Yeah , super . ( Beat . ) Okay , fine , you wan na know the truth ? Huh ? Who I 'm seeing on the side , ' s that it ? My work , that 's who . She 's my fucking mistress BELINDA PHIPPS right CODY PHIPPS It 's true . I like it , I 'm good at it , and it makes me happy . I love making more money than any other guy in this town , ' cause it just pisses ' em off . I dig that . Plus , work does n't complain , or rag on me about shit , or leave those fucking tampons wrapped in toilet paper in the trash for the dog to drag down to the living room so , yeah , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a damn thing that you can do about it CODY flicks his shirt at the wall . Exhales loudly . p. 59 CODY PHIPPS This sucks . You know that ? This whole thing , what we 've got here or ended up with . It really sucks . It 's shit BELINDA PHIPPS No . It 's marriage . CODY is about to respond when a child begins to whimper on the baby monitor . The parents look at each other . BELINDA PHIPPS so ? CODY PHIPPS Hey , you 're always saying " We both work , I just work here . " So , get to work CODY makes a dismissive gesture with his hand . Does it again . CODY PHIPPS Do n't forget to tell Shakespeare to cut the grass And with that , CODY is gone . The WOMAN sits for a moment , taking all this in . A long moment . Then she starts to cry . Not a lot  --  that 's hard on an actor , and we 've got a ways to go  --  but a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Othello who was jealous ! Not the other way around . Asshole . The lights fade on her and up slowly on the MAN , who is now standing in his old spot . He 's changed his clothes  --  not too much , but khakis and a shirt , tennis shoes  --  and seems ready to go somewhere . p. 60 MAN see what I mean ? I do n't really know the whole story , but those two have got something going on . Some sorta trouble . They do ( Beat . ) I mean , it 's a detached garage and all , but hey voices carry . Lights slowly rise on a new playing space while the MAN is talking . A sort of backyard , with maybe a barbecue pit or that type of thing . A picnic table . We wo n't use it just yet , but I wanted to give you a heads-up . MAN we 're gon na be together again in a minute  --  the three of us , I mean  --  so I just wanted to grab a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what 's going on . By the way , funny how you never see the kids , is n't it ? It 's not weird or anything , like in Virginia Woolf or whatever it 's just a personal choice . We thought that might be too much , plus kids 're hard as shit to work with  --  not them themselves , I mean , I like kids , I do  --  but the labor laws and tutors and all that crap , so we just decided against ' em . Or plan to , after this gets finished and somebody decides to stage the thing anyhow , what I 'm saying is : Children are great , but you ai n't gon na see any of ' em tonight ! Okay ? Good . CODY and the WOMAN enter now , each taking up positions in the backyard space . CODY is manning the grill , and she is busy setting the table . Plates , forks , napkins . That sort of deal . The MAN looks over at them and smiles . p. 61 MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you just see them together , from afar . Problem is , I think it has to be really afar , because otherwise you might hear what they 're saying to each other ! Still , they are very attractive people and in a way , that makes all this somewhat , umm , sadder . Not that I well , watch what happens . You 'll see what I mean . Sorry ! I 'm being so cryptic , and I do n't mean to be . Just watch . It 's all gon na be okay in the end . It will , I promise He smiles out at us and then moves off , toward CODY and the WOMAN . They spot him coming  --  CODY turns back to his grill , and the WOMAN stands to greet the MAN . They hug ; CODY catches it . MAN hello ! BELINDA PHIPPS Oh ! Hi there MAN Hey . ( looking around ) Where 're the kids ? BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , you know , around . Cody Jr . ' s at a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice ( another hug ) Hi . CODY PHIPPS Shit . ( Beat . ) Do n't mind me They laugh at this  --  not CODY , of course , but the MAN and the WOMAN . They break their hug , and she goes back to setting up drink cups . The MAN tries to help out . p. 62 MAN Sorry . It 's just CODY PHIPPS What ? MAN I du n no . Great to see you guys I mean , both of you . CODY PHIPPS Yeah ? Well , then , you better get over here and gim me a big cuddle , too , while you 're at it . I do n't wan na be left outta the lovefest . The MAN chuckles , then decides to call CODY 'S bluff . He moves toward the grill , but CODY holds up his chef tools in a makeshift cross . MAN I luv you , man . CODY PHIPPS Get the fuck outta here ! The men pretend to hug , then back away from each other . The WOMAN smiles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHIPPS and you did n't bring your cards , I see . MAN Oh , damn ! Sorry . You want me to run back over and ? CODY PHIPPS Nah , we can do it later . What took you so long ? ( checks his watch ) It 's already ten after MAN Oh , yeah , sorry I was finishing up this movie . On TV . Had to let it wrap up that 's the best part . p. 63 CODY PHIPPS What , the end ? MAN Uh-huh . BELINDA PHIPPS Why , to see what happens ? MAN Well , sure , yeah but to see who ends up with whom . How they all get paired off . The characters , I mean BELINDA PHIPPS Oh . Right CODY PHIPPS okay MAN No , seriously I love that . Trying to guess who 'll end up together . Or if . If they will . As a writer , I find it really interesting CODY PHIPPS Cool . ( Beat . ) You want steak or some chicken ? I got burgers , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? CODY PHIPPS Yep . Same thing I 'm doing . High on the protein . No carbs MAN Great . CODY turns to a covered plate and begins taking off the foil to get at the meat . The MAN decides to return and help the WOMAN . He picks up a pitcher and starts pouring drinks . BELINDA PHIPPS so , what was on ? The TV , I mean . p. 64 MAN Oh , it was this Hitchcock thing BELINDA PHIPPS Nice . Which one ? MAN No , it was a , like , some tribute or something . On cable BELINDA PHIPPS Oh . MAN All weekend . They 're playing a ton of his films one right after the other . It 's pretty great . BELINDA PHIPPS I like Hitchcock I think Cody does , too . Do n't you , honey ? CODY PHIPPS What 's that ? BELINDA PHIPPS Like Hitchcock movies CODY PHIPPS Not much . They 're all right . The Birds was good ( Beat . ) Anyways , I thought you were some playwright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the movies ? BELINDA PHIPPS anyway ( to the MAN ) Let 's  --  MAN You liked The Birds , huh , Cody ? That sounds suspiciously like you having fun CODY PHIPPS Yeah , time ' a my life CODY slaps some meat on the grill , seasons it , and puts down the lid . Opens the little steam valve . p. 65 BELINDA PHIPPS And what were you watching ? I mean , before you came over MAN Oh , right . Yeah , I was finishing up Strangers on a Train . Tonight is Vertigo , and this morning was that one with , ummm Shadow of a Doubt . Plus , there 's one of the lesser ones later , at midnight . BELINDA PHIPPS Really ? Which one I like him , maybe I 'll watch it . CODY PHIPPS You already said that . Said you liked Hitchcock already BELINDA PHIPPS I know , I was just  --  CODY PHIPPS just so you do . Know . MAN It 's , umm , Marnie . I think . BELINDA PHIPPS Oh . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I 'm gon na go get the veggies . BELINDA PHIPPS check on the baby , would ya ? CODY nods and heads off toward the kitchen  --  any of the exits will do . We just need to get him offstage . The MAN stops him . MAN you mean " thief . " CODY PHIPPS What ? p. 66 MAN She 's a thief , in the film . Marnie . Or , Tippi Hedren is , the actress . She 's a thief in that one CODY PHIPPS Oh , I thought she was both . Anyway , same difference philosophically speaking . MAN Really ? How 's that ? CODY PHIPPS She steals shit , right ? MAN Yeah CODY PHIPPS Well , liars just steal the truth ' S the same thing . It 's all theft . And with that , CODY exits . The MAN and WOMAN are left looking at each other  --  that 's okay , they do n't mind . An easy smile between them . MAN man 's got a point . BELINDA PHIPPS He always does  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it usually has to do with his mother MAN Ahhh , right . ( Beat . ) Well , too bad they did n't offer a " philosophy " course at school he might 've aced it . BELINDA PHIPPS Probably . He does always get what he wants MAN Yeah ? BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , yeah . Always . p. 67 MAN Even you ? I mean The WOMAN looks hard at the MAN , unsure how to respond . She looks back at the house , then moves over toward him . BELINDA PHIPPS no . He got me because I wanted him to . That 's how . MAN Really ? BELINDA PHIPPS Yes . From that first time I saw Cody on the bus . The activity bus home one night . Right from then . MAN wow . BELINDA PHIPPS Uh-huh . MAN That 's so great . Really . BELINDA PHIPPS Why ? Why is that great ? MAN Oh , you know , because it 's true love and all that . Right ? BELINDA PHIPPS you sure it 's not just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe that 's why She tries to smile but has to look away , blushing . The MAN stops for a moment , as if stunned by this . He then moves down center . Toward us . MAN okay , obviously she did n't say it like that . I mean , it 's obvious , right ? She 's not that way , would never say a thing like that God , can you picture her saying that ? ! Anything like that ? ( laughs ) No way , not at all . Or any girl , really . Not any that I know . Maybe , like , in a movie or something , but real people ? Uh-uh . But , see it is what I 'm thinking right now . Or then . I mean , what I 've had in my head since the first time I heard about her and Cody . Or anytime you see a white girl and a well , you know . And it is a clich , I 'm aware of that , but it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or stories , or whatever you wan na call ' em . And so I ca n't help it if that 's what I 'm imagining right now I ca n't ! And anyhow , a clich is just a thing that 's true , usually . Some true thing that gets said over and over ( Beat . ) But no , she never said that . Or will . Or will ever . Not her . Not Belinda Rivers . That was her maiden name Rivers . I bet she 's never said that before . " Cock . " Not even lying in bed , with him , or Jesus , he may be the only guy she 's ever laid in bed with ! I mean , it 's possible . Shit , that 's whoah . Could you imagine ? Damn . ( Beat . ) Anyway , we need to be careful here , be as true to this as we can , so , no she 'd never say that . About Cody 's , you know thing . That was all me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  just that o-kay , let 's drop it The MAN shrugs and returns to the picnic table , back there next to the WOMAN , who is turned and lost in thought . Just like we left her . Well , that 's convenient . p. 68 MAN That 's so great . Really . BELINDA PHIPPS Why ? Why is that great ? MAN Oh , you know , because it 's true love and all that . Right ? BELINDA PHIPPS people do n't really use those words anymore , do they ? I mean , not in a long time MAN No . I s'pose not . But it 's a nice thought all the same The WOMAN stands and goes to check the grill . She lifts the lid and turns the pieces of meat one by one . The MAN rises to stand near her . BELINDA PHIPPS I wanted to be noticed . That 's what it was . MAN Hmmm ? BELINDA PHIPPS The reason I first oh , nothing . MAN No , go ahead . Please . BELINDA PHIPPS When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out  --  bowling or to the skating rink , I do n't remember now  --  I said okay because I thought it would make me stand out . MAN Really ? BELINDA PHIPPS Sure . That 's the problem with high school  --  one of the many problems , anyway . You 're so desperate to fit in , and at the same time totally needing to stand out p. 69 MAN Exactly . Yeah , I mean yes . BELINDA PHIPPS You know ? And for me , well I guess I never really stopped . Doing this , I mean , marrying Cody and staying here  --  if you could 've seen my dad 's face !  --  it 's sad , really . Not sad , I suppose , but pathetic , almost . That I need people to be aware of me that badly . Does n't matter what you look like or how smart you are . No . It 's really how you feel about yourself . Who you are . And I was raised with the total sense that I was n't good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's it . My parents were always nervous that I 'd make some mistake along the way , even in preschool ! And so , at some point that is what I decided to do . Prove ' em right . I made a " mistake " they 'd never forget . ( Beat . ) But I was in love , too . I should n't sound  --  well , actually I should n't be saying any of this , but  --  I loved him . Cody . When we got married . I really think I did but , then , it did n't hurt that he was rich and black and different . Especially the last one . Rich , I do n't care so much about . I mean , it 's okay and black , well , that was n't such a bad thing , either . But different ? Now , that 's a good one I like different . Or at least thought I did The WOMAN looks at the MAN , to gauge his reaction . He nods and looks back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not stupid . p. 70 MAN oh . BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah . " Oh . " As in , oh-oh MAN That 's funny . I mean , interesting . BELINDA PHIPPS Not really . MAN But it 's is that true ? BELINDA PHIPPS Yes . Mostly . Because doing that , marrying him , it made me different , too . And I still get some kind of thrill from it walking into an Arby 's or through Wal-Mart with these two brown children in tow . My little pickaninnies  --  that 's what my parents call them  --  with their light-colored eyes . I do . I mean , it might be old hat in a place like New York or wherever , but around here it 's still a pretty big deal . ( Beat . ) These faces turning ' round to get a look at us , the whispering , and me with this fat checkbook and my head all held up . Defiant . I do n't even know why I like it so much . I just do MAN Wow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , it 's why ? Why " scary " ? BELINDA PHIPPS scary that I 'm that needy . She looks at the MAN , and he trails off . Tries to smile . p. 71 MAN No. not at all ( Beat . ) Listen , this is going to sound lame , so I 'm preparing you now , but see , I always thought you stood out . Completely . I mean , so much BELINDA PHIPPS Huh . Well MAN Wow , that was even worse than I thought ! I mean , seriously sad . Forgive me . BELINDA PHIPPS No way . I 'm keeping that it 's all mine . MAN What ? BELINDA PHIPPS Just that , you know , little tidbit . You put it out there , so I get to have it and thank you . MAN " Pleasure "  --  he says , glancing around to see if the husband is about to plunge a steak knife into his back They both laugh at this  --  good , that 's nice . Just like before . BELINDA PHIPPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , anyway . MAN That 's all I need . A minute . I 'm much faster than I used to be BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah , but he 'll kill ya out in the open . It 's in the flats , that 's the problem MAN Damn that Flyin ' Cody Phipps ! They laugh again  --  but they 'd better be careful . CODY 's coming . At the last moment , they both notice . p. 72 BELINDA PHIPPS Hey , sweetie ! MAN Cody you need any help ? CODY PHIPPS Nah , I 'm good ( Beat . ) Would n't wan na break up your coffee klatch there . BELINDA PHIPPS We were just MAN talking , you know CODY PHIPPS Yeah , yeah , I know . I do know . Was watching you from the window there , in the kitchen , and boy , you two are like a couple old nannies ! MAN That 's us ! BELINDA PHIPPS I was checking the meat for you , and we just got to CODY PHIPPS Funny , he never talks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( looking around ) Are you I mean , do you mean me ? ' Cause I 'm standing right here . CODY PHIPPS I know exactly where you are . Believe me BELINDA PHIPPS Honey , please do n't CODY PHIPPS Does n't bother me . Not at all . You can knock yourselves out I just noticed it . That 's all . CODY takes a quick peek at the grill and then , satisfied , finds himself a nearby chair . He looks at the two of them . p. 73 CODY PHIPPS carry on . BELINDA PHIPPS I think most of this is ready . Umm , maybe not the cutlets MAN yeah , I think chicken 's supposed to be  --  CODY PHIPPS Give it a minute . ( Beat . ) So , what 's up ? What 're you guys blabbing your heads off about ? Hmm ? BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , just , you know CODY PHIPPS Nope . I do n't . I do not . MAN Just , stuff , really . Life stuff CODY PHIPPS What 's that mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all . CODY PHIPPS But not about you , I 'll bet . ( Beat . ) Am I right ? MAN What 's that mean ? BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , honey , let 's just would you check these burgers , please ? CODY PHIPPS I said leave it . Shit . They 're fine . ( to the MAN ) I 'm saying I could see you both yakking on out here about shit , but my guess is you did n't say a damn thing about yourself . p. 74 MAN Why do you say that ? CODY PHIPPS ' Cause I 've noticed it . Times we 've been together like pulling molars outta your skull to get anything at all personal The MAN backs away a little  --  I never really noticed it , but maybe CODY 's right about him . The MAN sits at the table . MAN that 's true . I 'm not the most open guy around . Yeah . CODY PHIPPS Well , that 's big of you MAN Cody , look BELINDA PHIPPS sweetie CODY PHIPPS No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya leave your damn windows open all day and night  --  but I do n't got hardly two bits of info on you . Was a lawyer . Has a kid . That 's it BELINDA PHIPPS I 'm turning the grill off The WOMAN does so . She starts moving the meat from the metal rack inside the grill to a large serving plate . The MAN takes a drink , then smiles at CODY . MAN because those 're the highlights . Honestly , not much to tell . CODY PHIPPS Bullshit . Everybody 's got a story . Every-body p. 75 MAN ' S that right ? What 's mine , then ? I mean , if you 're so sure and all BELINDA PHIPPS Guys , can we just ? MAN No , it 's okay . It 's fine . He 's got something he wants to say , so we should probably just hear it CODY PHIPPS Yeah ? MAN Go for it . CODY PHIPPS ' Kay Well , let 's see . You told us about your daughter . Not much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sore spot MAN Did I forget to trim your hedges or something ? I mean , Cody , what is up with this ? CODY PHIPPS Nothing . Just playing with you MAN No , you 're not . Uh-uh . You 've got a thought , so let 's hear it . What ? CODY PHIPPS all right . Fine . ( Beat . ) Why 're you really back here ? And none of your smart-mouth answers why did you stop being a lawyer ? That 's not something people really do . Give up a good job like that . Not usually . The MAN looks long and hard at CODY , then over at the WOMAN . She 's making herself a burger , but she 's listening . No doubt about that . p. 76 MAN I just did , that 's all . Okay ? Just up and quit one day , had my fill of it and walked out . Cleared out my things , and I was done . CODY PHIPPS Huh pretty generic . ( Beat . ) Plus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . MAN Writers can live anywhere , Cody . That 's kind of the point Both CODY and the WOMAN watch the MAN , realizing that he does n't wish to go any further . In a way , though , he needs to . This is the right moment . BELINDA PHIPPS do n't feel like you have to CODY PHIPPS Do n't do that . All right ? Do n't just always jump in to defend every damn person I have a conversation with . It is pretty fucking annoying ( Beat . ) The guy can just tell me to shut up , if he wants BELINDA PHIPPS I know that . I know . I only wanted to make this nice , have some food out on the lawn . I 'm sorry The marrieds stare each other down  --  to her credit , the WOMAN is holding her own . MAN no , Cody 's right . That 's a total crock  --  company-line shit . I had to sign a statement , actually , that I would tell that story , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to it , I guess . Yep . ( Beat . ) But you guys , well you 're friends of mine , right ? I can tell you the truth . Sure . ( to the WOMAN ) Do you mind if I have one of the burgers ? The WOMAN nods , starts fixing him one . The MAN watches her as he talks ; the WOMAN brings one each to the MAN and to CODY. p. 77 MAN I was let go . " Fired , " I guess , is the term they used to use when our fathers were alive . Well , maybe not your father , Cody , because he was a self-made guy , but my old man was a mechanic , worked at that Union 76 over on McHenry all his life , and if he screwed up  --  like , totally ruined somebody 's car or mouthed off to the owner  --  then he would get fired . He was n't , no but I was . Me . I was fired . For something I did . BELINDA PHIPPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , please do n't . Okay ? I want you to hear this , Belinda . Need you to . Because I have n't really told anyone , so it feels good . Not good , but you know freeing , somehow . BELINDA PHIPPS Are you sure you ? CODY PHIPPS Just let the man talk . MAN Thanks . Yeah . Well , does everybody have what they want , for lunch , I mean ? Because after this , we may not be just checking . ( Beat . ) I was a good lawyer , fair , anyway . I was very fair with people , and decent . And that 's not an easy thing , in that job . Not at all , but I was . Anyhow , I 'm on a business trip one time , with some of the people from my office , we were going to , ummm , Pittsburgh or someplace , I do n't remember , but we 're late for the plane  --  it was on United , I recall that , it was with United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes before the flight closed , but a friend , this dude I knew from law school , is up there getting his boarding pass , and he lets me slip in . Into line . Ahead of a few other colleagues and one of them , this lady named Carol , an African-American woman who worked with us , says something out loud . Not a big deal , like , " Hey , no cuts , " or something , but you know , the kind of day it was , all rainy and a race through the terminal , I just was n't in the mood . Not at all . Yet I let it go . I do . I get my thingie and even use some miles to get bumped up  --  the last guy to be able to do it , they are totally sold out  --  and off we go , my buddy and me , down toward security and to the gate . I make eye contact with ol ' Carol on the way , toss her a smile , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and grab a McRib each . Those 're really good The MAN takes a breather ; CODY and the WOMAN are still there , hanging on his words . CODY heard the " African-American " thing , and his antennae are up . p. 78 CODY PHIPPS where 's this going ? BELINDA PHIPPS Honey , he 's trying to  --  CODY PHIPPS I 'm just asking . MAN I 'm sorry , I 'm rambling . Lemme just get to the we get on the plane . So , we 're sitting there in first , having our pretakeoff ginger ale or whatever , and people are filing past , bashing into me  --  I 'm on the aisle  --  with their two bags each , and we 're talking away , and bam ! , I get tagged again by some computer case . Right on the elbow . And it hurts , it really does , so I 'm about to say something when I glance up , it 's Carol . Not even looking . Heading back into economy  --  thanks to me , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start laughing . I mean howling , really , the two of us , there in the cabin.At some point , I 'm not sure when , a bit later  --  I thought a lot later , but  --  I lean over to him , I lean in a bit and say , really whispering , " Well , at least they still sit in the back of the bus . " Just for fun , right ? It 's this little joke , we 're on an Airbus , after all , and I swear to God , the place goes silent . Like a church for a moment , when the A/C is about to switch over or something I say this thing and a bunch of folks are suddenly looking right down at me . Including Carol . See , some old lady back there is messing around with her suitcase , this old Samsonite , and the line has n't moved . Carol is , I mean , she is standing right there . Shit I start to sputter , try to stand up , my belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , I spill the drink . A whole parade . I do finally get to my feet and try to explain , say , " What I meant to say was " and she tears into me , well , it was pretty unbelievable . ' S like Angela Davis has suddenly appeared , and she 's all waving her hands and screaming at me  --  you know how black women can get  --  with the " motherfuckin ' " this and that , like she 'd never been to school a day in her life ! And I I lost it . I admit it , I just totally lost it there for a bit and I grabbed her by both her shoulders , this Carol woman , not hard or anything , but grabbed her and shook her a second . I shook her and said , " Hey , Carol , stop it ! Stop acting like some blue-gummed chimp , just fell outta the tree ! " ( Beat . ) So just imagine what the next five minutes were like , those last few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so unreal . No , surreal . I will never forget that feeling And I did n't apologize , that 's the thing . Which is what really does me in , I guess . See , they wanted this formal letter of anyway , I just would n't do it . I was n't gon na back down . I was defiant . The firm " let me go " about three days later . Well , I guess suspended first , but then yeah . My wife left a few weeks after that . Not because it bothered her , I do n't think , but because it was the right thing to do . Or gave her an excuse , anyway . This was almost a year ago . And that is who you are renting your apartment to . ( Beat . ) Anyway , Cody , how 's that burger ? CODY takes another bite before he says anything . Maybe two . p. 79 BELINDA PHIPPS Maybe we should I do n't know . What should we do now ? Cody ? CODY wipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uses it . Stands . CODY PHIPPS Me ? I 'm gon na go check out the dish maybe that Hitchcock movie you 're both so excited about . MAN You did ask CODY PHIPPS Yeah , I know . Do n't mean you always got ta tell the truth . BELINDA PHIPPS Cody , we still have all this CODY PHIPPS Then wrap it up . Save it for the kids , I do n't give a damn MAN Maybe I 'll head back over to  --  CODY PHIPPS No , you guys have a nice chat . Go on . Like nothing happened . And it did n't , right ? Nothing happened . Other than we found out what a piece of shit we got living here with us The MAN starts to say something , then stops . The WOMAN moves to CODY , but he shakes her off . Holds up a finger . CODY PHIPPS ( toward the MAN ) you need to get gone . Outta this place . Right ? End of the month . CODY wanders off toward the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . Maybe even longer  --  no hugs this time . Just silence . Then , out of nowhere , her hand touches the MAN 's hand . She holds it . Now , this is interesting . p. 80 BELINDA PHIPPS well . I 'm sure he 's  --  I mean , he usually does n't stay mad long MAN Does n't matter . BELINDA PHIPPS No ? MAN Uh-uh . Glad I said it . Needed to . BELINDA PHIPPS Then good . People should do what they need to do . Mostly . MAN Yeah . ( stands ) I 'm gon na go back upstairs , is that okay ? BELINDA PHIPPS Oh , please . Sure . Yes . I 'll just I 'm gon na clean some of this up . MAN Do you want any ? BELINDA PHIPPS No , I 'm fine . Absolutely . MAN ' Kay . Sorry . BELINDA PHIPPS No , do n't be , it 's it was only lunch , right ? MAN Right . I 'll see you , then . BELINDA PHIPPS You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward us . She remains and clears the table . MAN so , that was different , huh ? Very . Hey , maybe that 'll make her like me more or something . She says she likes different . And I am that , if nothing else ( Beat . ) Speaking of Belinda , and I should 've done this earlier , but hey . One thing you should know  --  or should 've known  --  about us . We did kiss once . Yes . I do n't mean in the past , not at the drive-in or anything , but recently . Like , within the last few weeks . Not a big deal , I mean , it was very nice , do n't get me wrong but it was just this small little thing . It was . Or will be . Out on the lawn here one time , when I 'm cutting the side yard . I was  --  or will be  --  ahh , mowing , like I said , or I guess maybe I was raking at that point . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's pretty much it . Just this nice kiss that comes from her bringing me a glass of tap water , something to cool me off . Did n't work ! Not after not after doing that . With her . I was n't or will not be  --  I am not cool after that ! And it 's out of nowhere , that 's the thing that really knocks me out we just kiss . We kiss like there 's a respirator between us and our lips are the only thing keeping the other person going . You know how that is , when you 're with someone and you get a bit close , sort of begin to cross the demilitarized zone and there 's no going back that 's how it went . Amazing . The MAN drifts for a moment , remembering it . Let 's give him some space  --  it sounds like it was kind of great . We probably should 've shown it before , but too late now . Or is it ? p. 81 MAN But hey if you guys wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss , at least . The thing itself . It 's a bit weird , to do it over again , I mean , you know , after all the other stuff that you 've but we can pull it off . No problem . Here . He takes off his shirt , pitches it out of the way . Finds a weed-eater somewhere onstage  --  that 's the designer 's problem . The MAN starts working on the feeder ( where the fishing line comes out of the thing ) , and suddenly , the WOMAN appears . Glass of water in her hand . Ice cubes . The MAN looks up . She smiles at him , holding up the drink . He takes the tumbler and gulps down the cool liquid . She smiles and , without thinking , reaches over and wipes his brow . He smiles back . And then they 're kissing  --  kind of surprising , but believe me , it 's happening . This goes on for a few moments . When they stop , she leans over and steals a sip from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Wistful . Unsure . He shakes it off and looks back at us . Starts changing his clothing  --  he 's going to need some jogging stuff . Sweats . Shoes . Nothing too fancy . MAN see , I told you  --  it was pretty nice . I do n't know if you could tell that from where you guys 're sitting , but it was really so damn nice . ( Beat . ) There 's a name for that area there , way up in the last rows you know what it is ? It 's slang , but it 's funny as hell ! Check it out sometime , it 's in that Oxford dictionary . I 'll give you a clue . It 's under " N. " The MAN stretches now , shaking out his limbs . Trying to loosen up a bit . p. 82 MAN you know , while we 're gettin ' so fancy  --  like , back in time and all that  --  we should probably take a look at something that happened a while ago . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that far back , but before now . Or before now later , when this part happens . Right ? Anyway , it 's worth checking out , ' cause it definitely puts a wrinkle in things . Yeah , adds a little Well , you 'll see . CODY enters , wearing running gear again and sweating through it . Sits down and starts stretching out . MAN Cody and I met up once over at this nature preserve where they have these running trails . A mile or so from here . A few weeks after the whole lawn-party thing . We hooked up and went for a jog . This is how it goes The MAN wanders over near CODY and drops down , starts his own form of stretching . Gradually , CODY glances at him . MAN hello . Hey . CODY PHIPPS What 's up ? MAN Not much . CODY PHIPPS All right . Here CODY stands up and unzips a large pocket on the front of his windbreaker . Pulls out a business envelope and hands it over to the MAN . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 83 CODY PHIPPS ' s your deposit . MAN Uh-huh . ( stops ) Kind of niggardly , is n't it ? CODY PHIPPS Would you can it with that shit ? It is not funny MAN I 'm joking ! It 's a joke ( Beat . ) You know what the word means , do n't ya ? CODY PHIPPS Yeah , I do . I understand , but that do n't make it cool . MAN Okay , sorry . ( taps his leg ) You 're not gon na take anything out for my changing the carpet ? CODY PHIPPS Ha-ha . Real cute MAN Just asking . CODY shakes his head ; the MAN smiles and jams the thick wad of money into his warm-up pants . He reaches into another pocket and produces a single baseball card inside a thick plastic case . Hands it to CODY , who marvels at it and pops it into his front pocket . Zips it closed . CODY PHIPPS Thanks ( Beat . ) I do n't like this . I do n't like meeting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all right . I just needed some cash p. 84 CODY PHIPPS Whatever . MAN Had to rent a new place , buy a few knickknacks , that sort of thing moving 's not easy . CODY PHIPPS Good . Well , now you 've got a little spending money . MAN Thank you . Thanks , Cody . CODY PHIPPS Yeah , yeah . Right . MAN That means a lot to me CODY PHIPPS Just shut up , okay ? Really do n't . ( Beat . ) So , are we good ? MAN Yep . CODY PHIPPS Fine . ( Beat . ) How many times 've you seen her now ? I mean , since then . That day . MAN A few . Six , maybe CODY PHIPPS Six ? She 's called you six times ? MAN Something like that and yes , I make sure she calls from the house . Leaving a paper trail CODY PHIPPS Fine . Okay . And you 've met ? MAN a couple . CODY PHIPPS I do n't want to know any more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his limbs , getting ready to run . CODY PHIPPS but you guys are n't I mean , you have n't , umm right ? Not yet . MAN That 's really not your business . Is n't that what we discussed ? That was up to my discretion CODY PHIPPS No , yeah , true , I was just MAN believe me , it 's better not to . I 'm the one used to be the lawyer , remember ? CODY PHIPPS ' Course I do . It 's the only reason the two of us are even standing here . ( Beat . ) How much longer , you figure ? MAN What , until you can say something ? Or catch us ? Hell , I du n no give it a month or so . Do n't ya think ? CODY PHIPPS Yeah . That 's I s'pose . MAN You seem anxious CODY PHIPPS Of course I am . Come on ! MAN Of course you are ( Beat . ) Who is she , by the way ? CODY PHIPPS What ? MAN The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week . She 's cute , but really young . p. 86 CODY PHIPPS No , that 's the I 'm training her . She 's on the track team at  --  MAN Right . Look , I know you 've told the wife that you 're in love with your work , I know that  --  she told me as much  --  but please , Cody , do me the favor . I 'm a guy . I can smell chick on you a mile away CODY PHIPPS No , seriously , I 'm not no . MAN Hey , whatever it takes to sleep at night . Knock yourself out . CODY PHIPPS I do n't know what you 're saying MAN I 'm saying , pretty outright , that a person does not do this , this Mayor of Casterbridge thing you 've got going here , without some reason . A reason like the one I saw you out running with . CODY PHIPPS No , shit , that is it 's not anything . I just wanted to get this Jackie Robinson card back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did not ask me to go in with you on this racket , our little shell game we 're running , just so you could put some piece ' a cardboard back into your collection ( Beat . ) You asked me to take your wife  --  have her in trade  --  if I 'd help you pull it off . For shit like that , I mean , that elaborate there is always a reason . p. 87 CODY PHIPPS No , we just got to talking I mean , at the airport we got to talking about that card and then , I du n no , we MAN Cody , I was there , remember ? Right there next to you . You asked me this flat out . Told me your story . The " disgruntled hubby , the trophy wife , " the whole damn business . CODY PHIPPS Yeah , but I knew you liked her back in school , I 'm saying . I came to you because I was because MAN No , I came up to you saw you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three beers later you dish up this proposition . A whopper of a proposition CODY PHIPPS I 'd just been thinking , that 's all ! Thinkin ' about it . ( Beat . ) You did always like her . I know that MAN So , you were just being nice , then ? Gon na let me have her as a gift ? CODY PHIPPS No , I MAN You gave me your wife . Asked me to take her . Now , you 're either Henny Youngman , or there 's something fishy going on ! ( Beat . ) I 'm only saying this to help remind you  --  do not forget the truth here . The truth is always of some importance . CODY stares at the MAN , not sure how he knows all this . Suddenly , the MAN seems a lot sharper than he 's come off during the rest of the proceedings . p. 88 CODY PHIPPS you must 've been a damn smart lawyer . MAN I was okay . Just all right . I did n't have the stomach for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her . She 's I do not need people knowing about that . She 's in school , and I do n't  --  MAN Good . I just want to know the how and why of it . Nothing more . CODY PHIPPS Fine . That 's fine . That is a long-term project . My own business . MAN Yes , it is . Keep it that way , okay ? You 've hidden it this long , do not screw it up now ( looking around ) I do n't like standing here , just yakking away like this . Maybe we should jog CODY PHIPPS What you and me ? MAN Yeah . Makes it look all natural . Just like two " buddies " out for a run . Keepin ' in shape . CODY PHIPPS I 'd kill you in a race MAN I did n't say " race . " I said " jog . " You 've got race on the brain , my man CODY PHIPPS You just do n't stop , do ya ? MAN Hey by any means necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89 CODY PHIPPS Stop ! Come on , dude , knock it off . MAN Okay The two men begin to " jog "  --  basically running in place , but we 'll work that out as we go . They move in silence for a bit , then start to talk again . CODY PHIPPS By the way that shit about the woman on the plane was not funny . At all . MAN Hah ! Sorry ' bout that spur-of-the-moment thing . CODY PHIPPS Yeah , well MAN It worked , did n't it ? CODY PHIPPS Yes , it worked . Worked at pissing me off , that 's what it did MAN Listen , we could 've gone on like that , me living upstairs and typing away , sneaking glances at the Mrs. for the next eight months . I made a move , did a little jump-start , that was all CODY PHIPPS You did n't have to go there say bullshit like that . MAN Cody , it was a perfect step , okay ? Per-fect . While you were in getting the kabobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her that made me feel that I should make a play like that and it worked . p. 90 CODY PHIPPS I hate that kinda thing , just so you know . Any kind of racist shit . Just so you 're aware MAN I know . Of course I know . That 's why I did it CODY PHIPPS I need her out of my home , but I do n't wan na go through all this crap to do it . Otherwise , fuck , I might as well just get a divorce MAN Hey , you are going to get divorced ! You 'll have to you 're just going to get everything that you want in the divorce . That 's why I 'm here . CODY PHIPPS right MAN Is n't that what we agreed to ? CODY PHIPPS Yeah . It is . MAN All right , then . So do n't let a tiny bit of prejudice get in the way of what we 're doing ( Beat . ) That thing on the plane happened . I just never lost my job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh with my co-worker , and enjoyed a first-class dinner all the way to Pittsburgh . I 'm not a lawyer anymore because I decided to get back into writing , that 's all . I am not married now because it did n't work out  --  I was a liar and a mediocre husband  --  but I 'm gon na try harder next time . And I do n't see my kid that often because she 's a girl and , frankly , I 'm just not that into it . ( Beat . ) That 's all there really is to my story p. 91 CODY PHIPPS Oh . MAN Yep . " Oh . " As in oh-oh CODY PHIPPS What ? MAN Nothing . Just something I heard The men stop running for a moment . Make that , the MAN stops ( holding his side ) , and CODY holds up for him . CODY PHIPPS Tired ? MAN Yeah , hold on a sec , lemme catch my breath . CODY PHIPPS You got ta push through the pain MAN you got ta back off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self . CODY PHIPPS Once a fatty , always a fatty . Ya probably got a weak heart . Kidneys . The MAN takes in a few deep breaths , trying to fight off a cramp . Flips CODY the finger . CODY wanders about , keeping warm and stretching . MAN hey , we ca n't all be Olympians . Or almost Olympians . CODY PHIPPS Whatever . MAN I mean , you did nearly make it , right ? That 's what I heard . CODY PHIPPS Something like that p. 92 MAN Not that I used to search all over the Internet for news of the past or whatnot , but you know . CODY PHIPPS Yeah . MAN Word gets around . CODY PHIPPS Great . MAN So what happened ? You were good . CODY PHIPPS Uh-huh . Well , " good " do n't mean shit . Not out there . Not in sports . MAN True . CODY PHIPPS Plus , I never even really come on , you probably heard the whole damn story . MAN No , seriously , what ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some big scholarship , but that 's all I  --  CODY PHIPPS Right . ( Beat . ) Well , I I hit a bad patch at college . Yeah . ' S what my ol ' man called it . " A rough spot . " The MAN does n't seem in any hurry to get back to it , so CODY paces around . Thinking . CODY PHIPPS I threw a race once , qualifying for nationals . This one race . Well , not threw , exactly , no , I guess I did n't " throw " it , ' cause to do that you 'd have to lose , and I did n't . Nope . See , I won won it , but I was n't supposed to . p. 93 MAN Really . That 's So what was the , you know ? I do n't follow . CODY PHIPPS it was this ( considers it ) nothing . Forget it . MAN No , what ? Come on CODY squats down near the MAN now , remembering . CODY PHIPPS they wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . And not even my event ! I was done for the day with two firsts , but they asked me to take off quick in the five thousand and tire the other teams out , help our guys out  --  something to do with building my character and shit like that , unity  --  but I was like , " Fuck this , " and took off running . Never looked back . I beat all ' a those motherfuckers. ( smiles ) Guess I 'm not cut out for " team " sports which I never knew track was till I got to college . CODY stops a second , recalling the moment . The MAN watches . CODY PHIPPS Anyways , I lost all my scholarships ' cause I would not apologize or back down . " Accept responsibility , " I think they called it and , you know , that 's what folks wan na talk about in the end . To dwell on . Me being defiant . But my winning , they forgot all about that fact . Just like usual . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wow " and so that 's what happened to the Olympics . That 's as close as I ever got to any gold medal . A long silence develops between the men  --  begrudging and respectful . These two may just be more alike than we first suspected . After a moment , CODY moves to the MAN and presses a finger into his chest . CODY PHIPPS so , what 's the next step ? MAN Whatever you want . Walk in on us at dinner or someplace you decide . CODY PHIPPS No , I thought you said that  --  MAN Can we just play it by ear ? I think it 's gon na be better that way . More real CODY PHIPPS Yeah , fine . ( Beat . ) Just back off on the bigotry shit . Do n't use that no more MAN I 'm not a racist , would you stop ! I did it for the effect you 're the one keeps bringing it up . CODY PHIPPS I just do n't want my kids hearing any of that . MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't allow it . p. 95 MAN What the hell do you think I 'd say ? Huh ? ! I hardly saw ' em when I lived on your property , so relax . CODY PHIPPS It 's hard enough out there , for a child like that . MAN Like what ? CODY PHIPPS You know he 's MAN See ? You 're the one doing all the segregating he 's a little boy . He 'll be fine ! Parents break up all the time , and the children bounce back . That's-their-job . To bounce . CODY PHIPPS Okay MAN it is interesting , though , about the kids . Kids like yours . People always see you as these minorities , right , but then you look at their skin and all that  --  the children , I mean  --  and you guys 're really the dominant ones . It 's true . All the nappy hair and the big lips and shit it always comes out on top , when your type gets together with some white girl . You ever notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it still does , all the same . Sure , they 've got Belinda 's eyes , but all the rest of it ' s straight from the Congo . CODY is suddenly next to the MAN , right in his face . The MAN does n't back off , and CODY lets him have it  --  pushes him hard on the chest , knocking him down . The MAN smiles , starts to get up , then dives at CODY 's legs . He brings CODY down , and the two wrestle like a pair of Greco-Romans . It gets kind of nasty . ( Actors are free to add their own assorted groans and fighting sounds here . ) They finally release and move away . Exhausted . The MAN stands up , wiping blood from his mouth with a tissue and moving down toward us . He glances back at CODY. p. 96 MAN All right , I admit it , that part was just a shameless attempt at a bit of action little treat for the " gun and knife " crowd . But hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , take a look at the Elizabethans , you do n't believe me . You give ' em the ol ' soliloquy here , you have ' em grab their crotch over there ' S all about balance . It is . In reality , he pushes me , I push back you know , it 's one of those guy fights . Lotta noise , not so much happens . ( Beat . ) Okay . So long as you know The MAN tucks his bloody tissue away and heads back to where CODY is sitting . Original tableaux  --  fancy name for same thing we just saw . After a long moment , CODY starts laughing . The MAN joins in . CODY PHIPPS you are a goofy fucker ! Seriously . Just like back in school MAN We aim to please CODY PHIPPS Damn ! I mean , shit , you 're crazy . MAN Depends on the day , Mr. Phipps . On the day in question CODY PHIPPS Yeah . But honestly , I do n't want my kids hearing that stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint custody , right ? p. 97 CODY PHIPPS ' Course . MAN Not total , because she 'll never go for that . But we can try to CODY PHIPPS Whatever we got ta do . Just do it . MAN " Just do it . " Nobody knows better than ol ' Nike . She was a goddess , was n't she ? In the ancient days , I mean . Nike . I think that 's where they got the , you know logo CODY PHIPPS Hell if I know . ( studying him ) You really are one odd motherfucker MAN Thank you . Compliment accepted CODY PHIPPS Uh-huh . I need to go . Get myself off to work . MAN Cool . I 'm meeting Belinda later . CODY PHIPPS Okay . CODY stops for a moment , then shakes his head . Laughs . CODY PHIPPS man , that is just too strange . Being in on a thing like that happy she 's cheating on me . MAN We can stop . We can all go have us another barbecue if you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just do what you need to p. 98 MAN I will . CODY nods and starts off , heading back toward town . The MAN stops him with a last question . MAN what is it about her , though , Cody ? That you hate so much ? CODY PHIPPS What ? MAN Just curious . CODY PHIPPS I do n't ( Beat . ) No , I guess I do , actually . Hate ' er . Never thought of it that way , but yeah . I do . MAN So ? CODY PHIPPS I du n no . After a while , it 's a bit of everything , I s'pose . Her face , the way she flosses her teeth , all that stuff . Browsing my mail and shit . Yeah . I mean , it 's great at first . She always looked real nice against my skin , walking around town hanging off my arm . I used to love it , I mean , it was cool going over and waiting in her living room , to go out . With her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , she is the mother of my kids and all , too , but after a while , you know I guess the novelty of it just wore off . MAN that 's nicely put . Succinct . CODY PHIPPS Just trying to be honest . MAN So , why did n't you , then ? Why not just leave , or ? p. 99 CODY PHIPPS ' Cause I got a place here in this community to think about . A legacy and the boys and all kinds ' a crap . She divorces me , and everybody says , " See , I told ya so . Told you it would n't work out , " and they leave it at that . But if I go , if I 'm the one to take off , well , then , I 'm just some uppity black boy , got no business being here . My stores 'll close , lose the house . Everything . ( Beat . ) The same reason my ol ' man stayed that guy hung in there , built his wife an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Nio and you know what ? The people respected him . They did . They all understood he married a cunt and let it go at that MAN but she 's not at all like your mom , is she ? Belinda , I mean . No matter what kind of crap you 've thrown at her , she does n't take off like your mother used to . Right ? Hard as you try CODY PHIPPS Do n't . Do not MAN which means she can never come crawling back , so you can forgive her . Like your father used to . CODY PHIPPS Dude you just found yourself yet another topic to keep your fucking paws off of . I mean it . MAN It was just a guess p. 100 CODY PHIPPS Yeah , well , suck my dick piece ' a shit like you talking about my dad . MAN No , thanks . I only eat white meat . CODY PHIPPS I ca n't wait till this thing is over . MAN Me , too . CODY PHIPPS Good . MAN ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by staying , and so are you ! Wow . You two are  --  CODY PHIPPS I 'm outta here fuck you . MAN You just keep your end of things up I 'll do the rest . Have a nice day CODY gives him the finger and walks off . Angry . The MAN turns away and moves back down toward us . Sheepish grin . MAN hey , sorry for that ! Got a touch outta hand , so forgive me . I should explain . You really need to take a good look at the last few moments , decide for yourselves what happened there . I mean , how much is real ( Beat . ) It happened , that much I can tell you . We did meet , talked for a bit , he gave me an envelope . We even ran . And I told you what went on  --  or will  --  when we get into our little shoving match . But the rest ? Well , hey , that stuff 's for you to decipher . I ca n't help you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys had to be expecting at least one exchange like what you just saw , right ? I mean , at least one some swearing , the digs at women . A crazy plot twist . You had to know that something like that was gon na transpire ! Without it , this would all be just so damn , what ? I du n no . Ordinary , I guess . People in and out of love . Trouble breaks out . Happens all the time  --  movies , on the TV , your neighbors next door . And I 'll tell you , it 's not so outlandish , either , what just went on . Not with all that junk you see on the news . People , they tire of each other , give up on what they 've got instead of fixing it , or trying to . It 's easier to just start over , go online , bury themselves at the office . Anything rather than get to the bottom of their own shit . We 're weak , that 's really what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it all today . Or sooner , even . Now . And as long as we get it , our fair share  --  or even a pinch more  --  well , then , who really gives a fuck what happens to anybody else ? Right ? The MAN pulls that thick wad of cash out of his pocket , turns it over in his hands . p. 101 MAN this could be my deposit , what I gave them when I moved in . Maybe . Or it 's a payoff for me to take the little missus off of Cody 's hands . Or for that baseball card , even ! Hell this might just all be going through my head when I 'm standing there at Sears , staring at Belinda again for the first time . I mean , do n't look at me I du n no where this damn thing is going , either ! I really do n't . All I do know is , whether any of that stuff you saw is real , the end result is this : I 've started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically , but I 've changed some of the situations around so that it 's not well , I do n't think anybody 's gon na notice . And especially not if it sells ! ( Beat . ) Belinda is with me now , out of their house and living at my place . She 's with the children most days , at least for the moment , just until they settle things , and Cody , well , he got what he wanted , too . He did . He finally got  --  after all those hurtful years of watching his dad take his mother back , time and time again  --  Cody got a white woman to walk out on him and stay gone . You should see him strutting around town now , telling anybody who 'll listen about what Belinda did , and how hurtful it 'll be on the kids and having the time of his life . How she never would 've done this , something so humiliating to him , if he was n't black . Seriously , people have told me he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't black . " Yep , he 's gone and pulled the ol ' Ace ' a Spades out , one last time would n't ya know it ? ( Beat . ) Also , I think maybe I came off a little too , I du n no , something , in that last bit . Not like myself . " I can smell chick on you a mile away . " I mean , come on ! ( laughs ) But then , people are so many things , faces , in a given day , maybe that 's just some side of me , this other part , that does n't get out that often but is there . I du n no . But this time  --  ' cause we 're about to finish this off right now  --  this time out I 'll be a bunch more like I was in the beginning . This is really about them now , anyhow , settling up and the like I 'm just there to be a support to her . To Belinda . Yep . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what the hell does that mean ? I do n't know . But we could use a desk , maybe , and a few chairs . CODY and the WOMAN should already be seated , waiting . The MAN can wander over in his own time . Soon , but you know what I mean . p. 102 MAN hello . Sorry that I 'm BELINDA PHIPPS It 's okay . ( checks CODY ) I mean , fine . MAN Right , right " fine but not okay . " I remember . BELINDA PHIPPS Yes . That 's right . They sit in silence for a moment  --  make it a long one . CODY glances around . Checks his watch . CODY PHIPPS Where is this guy ? ( to the MAN ) You see anybody out in the hall ? MAN Ahh , no , I did n't . I was just no . CODY PHIPPS Fine . MAN I 'm sure he 's coming CODY PHIPPS Yeah ? How do you know that ? MAN Just hopeful . That 's all BELINDA PHIPPS Guys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CODY grunts and goes back to staring at the wall ; the MAN reaches over and squeezes the WOMAN 's hand . She smiles . CODY PHIPPS You two look over everything ? The papers I had sent over , and the ? p. 103 BELINDA PHIPPS Yes . ( looks directly at CODY ) You do n't have to involve him , this is really between us . CODY PHIPPS Hey , he 's the one you 're screwing now , so he can  --  BELINDA PHIPPS I 'm really not gon na sit here for that ! I wo n't , Cody , I mean it . CODY PHIPPS Fine . I 'll shut up MAN I doubt that CODY PHIPPS Fuck off . MAN No , Cody , I do n't want to . So I wo n't . CODY and the MAN have one of those adolescent male stare-downs ; CODY blinks first . Looks away . Checks his watch again . CODY PHIPPS Two hundred bucks an hour , ya think he could be on time MAN Right . BELINDA PHIPPS Yes . That 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did look at the stuff , though , right ? I mean , all the changes from that last draft and the  --  BELINDA PHIPPS Yes , Cody , we read it over . Both of us . CODY PHIPPS Good . All right . And you 're sure you want the single payment instead of the ? p. 104 BELINDA PHIPPS Yes . MAN We do . Yeah . Better to just finish this off , clean , and we can all you agree to the custody schedule , and we 're fine with the settlement . ( takes the WOMAN 's hand ) We do n't want your precious house or your stores , any of that crap . We 'll manage CODY PHIPPS From what , your book deals ? BELINDA PHIPPS Cody CODY PHIPPS Just asking . MAN I do n't write books . I 'm writing a look , do n't worry about us , okay ? CODY PHIPPS Whatever . MAN Seriously BELINDA PHIPPS We 're going to be happy . That 's what 's important . Something we never figured out , you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . BELINDA PHIPPS I will . I 'm gon na think and feel and do whatever I want from now on . And you ca n't do anything about it . You ca n't yell at me , or make faces behind my back , or turn Cody Jr . against me anymore CODY PHIPPS Oh , please p. 105 BELINDA PHIPPS You ca n't ! You can not do one damn thing to me none of your silences or hitting or putting one of those dark fingers of yours anywhere near me . Not ever again . No , you are not allowed CODY PHIPPS you better watch it MAN No , Cody , she does n't have to CODY PHIPPS I said to watch your mouths , man ! ! BOTH OF YOU ! ! Just watch that kind of fucking shit around me CODY stands up and slams his chair against the table , taking a step toward the MAN . The MAN remains seated , not engaging . That 's probably best . The moment deflates , and CODY tries to save face  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na go look in the hall , check on this motherfucker . BELINDA PHIPPS You do that . CODY PHIPPS I will . MAN So , go then . Do it . CODY starts off , then looks back at the MAN . The WOMAN , too . A gleam in his eyes . CODY PHIPPS but if I ever wan na trade back , you 'll let me , right ? Hmm ? The MAN stares at him for a moment , then slowly nods ; CODY smiles and exits . The WOMAN watches him go , looking at the door . The MAN watches , too , until the WOMAN turns to him . p. 106 BELINDA PHIPPS what 's he mean by that ? MAN Oh , ya know . BELINDA PHIPPS No , I do n't . No . What ? MAN He 's , ummm , he 's just Cody 's just trying to They look at each other , then the WOMAN glances at the door again . After a moment , the MAN rises and crosses to us . MAN Okay , sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I tell Belinda everything or make a run for it ? The MAN glances back at her , then turns pleadingly to us for advice . MAN I 'm serious , gim me some help here . I always imagined a day like this , one where she stumbles on to a cell-phone record or a scribbled note on a napkin and asks me about it and I believe that I 'd do the righteous thing . Tell her the truth . But the thing of it is , the truth is just so damn elusive , is n't it ? Like , I mean , unknowable . In the end . The second you start telling somebody what the truth is  --  how it goes  --  it all starts to slip away . Not , like , some lie , exactly , but close . This half-remembered version of one side ' a things . And what would the point be ? I 'll tell you this much  --  we end up pretty happy . Or will , however this time issue works itself out . We go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple kids . Both boys , pleased to report . And we live happily ever after or the equivalent of that , whatever that means today . Yes , we disagree on occasion , I sleep in the guest room every now and then , one of the kids breaks an eardrum when he 's swimming , but all in all , we survive . We make it as a couple , and that , my friends , is not easy . It is work . But I love it , I do , I love her always have . And I can see it on her face , at night or when we 're on the back patio , at that blue hour when the sun 's just dropped down she is finally at peace . So what the hell am I gon na tell her right now to ruin it all ? Huh ? Nothing , that 's what I 'm gon na make up some tale about a baseball card I 've promised him from my collection and go with that . Stick with it to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jackie Robinson " story . Cody gave me that card  --  it really is a nice one  --  if I 'd go out with Belinda to the movies that one time . Time I mentioned way earlier . Remember ? See , he was cheating on her , even way back then . He 'd met this other girl , another cheerleader from over at Central , and he wanted to go out with her . That same night . So , he calls me , comes over , and tells me this whole tale about Belinda and how they 're dating other people and shit and would I mind helping out ? Cody tells me to go and pick her up at her house , six-thirty , and head over to the drive-in , this Showboat spot . He tells her the same thing  --  well , that I 'm gon na pick her up , but  --  he 'll meet us there , friends are joining us , I mean , the usual line of Cody Phipps bullshit . And that 's how I end up seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember going to . But I did get that card outta the deal . He was in a pinch , Cody was , and he agreed to it screamed his head off , but yeah , he gave it to me . And this was the ' 52 Topps card with the red overlay . That thick smear of crimson on the backside  --  like a baboon 's ass . Very scarce . But see , Cody was always so desperate to get into some white girl 's pants that he 'd part with something he really cared about . And that always made me hate him a bit  --  a little bit . Because he picked on me picked me to help him , since I knew what he was doing , totally got it , but I liked her so much , Belinda , that I was willing to anyway , that 's the kind of guy Cody was . ( Beat . ) See , Cody Phipps was born a nigger . He still is , to this day . And I do know the difference , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh yeah , absolutely . I never really liked the guy  --  yes , back in school , I 'd hang with him , do some stuff , but basically just so he would n't make fun of me or knock me around . But Cody was always a nigger , even back then . This lazy , mean-spirited coon who acted like everybody owed him something . All that sort of post-Civil War , Malcolm X , heavy-lidded bullshit that guys like him 've been trading on for years . Forty acres and a mule and always ready to lay down the ol ' Ace ' a Spades . Well , hey , man , forgive us for dragging your sorry asses over here , ' cause-it-wasn't-fuckin ' - worth- it ! ! ( Beat . ) Now , look I do n't really think in that way , use those terms very often , because the good side of me , the educated portion , says , " Hey , no , do n't you do that , we 're all God 's chillun , " and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  by whom I was  --  and that crap is always right up there , near the surface , waiting to bubble over . Cut me off in traffic sometime , you 'll see what I mean ! ( Beat . ) And anyhow it 's just a word , right ? " Nigger . " A word like any other . Only has power if you let it The MAN looks back at the WOMAN  --  she 's still staring off . Waiting for her cue . He looks back at us one more time . p. 107 MAN But I 'm not gon na screw this up forget it . I 'll make up a lie  --  I 'm a lawyer , do n't forget , ex , so it comes easy to me . Something . I 'm not saying the other stuff was at all true , that crazy shit about us trading or whatever , but we did see each other , Cody and I , at the airport that one time . And if she knows that , finds that out , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the garage apartment and some of their problems and all the rest . Maybe . And I 'm not gon na take that chance , because from there it 's only a hop-skip to understanding that , yes , I may have used this , used them in some way to get what I wanted . What I 've probably always wanted . Belinda . I 'll tell ya one thing , though  --  whether he was in on it or not  --  Cody was no idiot . Not ever . He could see what I was up to  --  slowly trying to take her away , away from him  --  and he did nothing to stop me . Encouraged it , even . So , that says something it does . I still see him , Cody , some days around town . Running . Over past the golf course and down there . I do n't think there 's so many hard feelings anymore . Least I hope not ( He looks over at the WOMAN . ) But I 'll smooth this over , and we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . That good stuff . I ca n't wait to be with her . Finally . After all this time . It 's taken a lot to get here , to this place , but it 's all for the best , is n't it ? Years of hatred and lies and betrayal that it took for Belinda and me to be together . For her to be happy . ' S worth it , though , right ? Sure . I mean , anything 's worth it , as long as you mean well The MAN smiles at us , then returns to his seat next to the WOMAN . He takes her hand , and she turns back to him . p. 108 BELINDA PHIPPS what did he mean , sweetie ? MAN Nothing . It 's a card , that 's all . That stupid Jackie Robinson card he 's been talking about BELINDA PHIPPS The rare one ? MAN Uh-huh . A quiet falls over them as the WOMAN studies the MAN . She reaches out and touches his face . Softly . BELINDA PHIPPS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  BELINDA PHIPPS I do . I 'm not stupid , so I know MAN I never said you were . ( Beat . ) Okay , honey , what ? Come on , what ? BELINDA PHIPPS You gave it to him . Did n't you ? That card . MAN Ummm , well yeah . Yes , I did . BELINDA PHIPPS You felt bad , and you gave it to him MAN I Look , I did it for you . For us . I thought it might , you know . Help . To smooth things over BELINDA PHIPPS Oh . ( Beat . ) So , what 's he wan na give you for it ? I thought you were p. 109 MAN Just one of his players . His BELINDA PHIPPS Yeah ? MAN yes . One of his good ones . BELINDA PHIPPS Huh . You sure you want to ? I mean , you love that thing just do n't let him bully you . Okay ? MAN I know . I wo n't . BELINDA PHIPPS Because he can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good heart , so MAN It 's fine . ( smiles ) Promise . BELINDA PHIPPS All right , then . ( Beat . ) You sure ? MAN No , yeah . I 'm sure . Very sure . Yep . Very BELINDA PHIPPS okay . She smiles at the MAN , then looks straight out at us . He reaches over and kisses her on the cheek . Slowly turns out to the audience . They are together now , but lost in their own thoughts . Alone . Silence . Darkness .
