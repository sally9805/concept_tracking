The best mayors in U.S. history have been great characters  --  showmen and radicals and bullies and rebels . Then again , so have the worst . Fiorello LaGuardia , who ruled New York from 1934 to ' 45 , besides reforming and rebuilding his city , was famous for smashing slot machines with a sledgehammer and reading the comics to children over the radio during a newspaper strike . On the other hand , Chicago 's William ( Big Bill ) Thompson , first elected in 1915 , kept a picture of his good buddy Al Capone on his office wall and once conducted a debate between himself and two white rats , which he placed onstage to represent his political opponents . <P> It is tempting to judge our mayors for the little things that make city life livable , the depth of the potholes , the smell of the streets , whether or not the traffic lights are in synch . But the best mayors have also been those who act on a grand scale , building bridges , saving schools , finding the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts to choose the best among the leaders of America 's most challenging cities , those with populations over half a million  --  a crop that brings in six Republicans , 22 Democrats and one unaffiliated mayor . That cutoff excluded mayors like Randy Kelly of St. Paul , Minn. ( pop . 288,000 ) , who has slashed crime 30% in 3 1/2 years . Our top performers range from Chicago 's imperial Richard Daley , who after 16 years is widely viewed as the nation 's top urban executive , to newcomer John Hickenlooper , the beer brewer who closed Denver 's worst budget gap ever without major staff or service cuts . Since good policy invites imitation , their most successful tactics may soon be coming to a city near you .  --  By Nancy Gibbs
