<p> RIVERS COLUMN/IMMIGRATION Tancredo supports law <p> Re : ' Tancredo just a bully in the schoolyard , ' Jan. 23 Reggie Rivers column . <p> As a one-time legal immigrant ( after a six-year wait for a visa ) and now an American citizen for decades , I have to respond to Reggie Rivers ' column . One of the reasons many of us consider it unwise to elect a liberal to anything significant is that so many of them are obnoxious , inveterate demagogues . Rep. Tancredo never said that ' children are responsible for their parents ' decisions . ' He did n't ' bully ' Jesus Apodaca - he simply observed that Apodaca was not here legally and therefore was n't entitled to taxpayers ' subsidy . He does not ask for ' every state and county agency to become an extension of the INS . ' He does not want ' the state employee a in the entrance booth at a state park a ( to ) check the citizenship of every occupant of every car . ' He does n't want ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's licenses , passports and/or green cards . ' <p> Tancredo even explicitly acknowledged that it is not his job ( or of every state agency , the entrance booth attendant , or the RTD driver ) to ask . All he wants is that the various agencies not knowingly give people who are not legally here taxpayer services to which they are not entitled . He is even making the humanitarian exemption with emergency services . <p> Rivers insults Tancredo because Tancredo objects to people breaking the law . Rivers supports that lawbreaking and says legal taxpayers should subsidize it . I wonder which other laws Rivers supports being broken . <p> K.A . SKALA <p> Denver <p> Illegals are costly <p> How much does Reggie Rivers figure it costs us to employ 8 million illegal aliens ? Especially when Rivers and his ilk complain about the 3 million unemployed we have right now ? How about the $ 7,000 a year that it costs us to educate one child of illegal parents ? How about that trip to the emergency room in order to deliver a child that becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strengthen its program and start shipping illegals back home , so they can get their work cards and come back as rightful and legal workers . <p> CRAIG WILLIAMSON <p> Lone Tree <p>  --  Dowd 's vitriol should n't grace Post 's pages <p> Re : ' Riding the crazy train , ' Jan. 23 Maureen Dowd column . <p> Maureen Dowd 's column absolutely reeks of venom , hate and animosity toward President Bush and his administration . <p> By comparison , Ruben Navarrette 's column ( ' Bush takes a stand ' ) on the same page presents a fair and unbiased picture of the president 's State of the Union address , as well as coverage of the Democratic primary candidates . Thomas Friedman 's column ( ' War of ideas , Part V ' ) , also on the same page , not only gives thorough coverage , but presents some differing ideas . <p> All that Dowd wrote is vitriol . To wit , here are a just a few of her word choices : ' Smirking his trademark smirk , ' ' he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Iraq with a real coalition rather than a gaggle of poodles and lackeys , ' ' swaggering sheriff routine , ' ' we do n't kneed no stinking piece of paper , ' ' strutted up onstage , ' ' cocky implicit defense . ' This woman 's work should not grace the pages of The Denver Post . I suggest you leave her miserable efforts to The New York Times and its readers . <p> HAROLD M. GOTT <p> Montrose <p>  --  GOP hacked Dems ' file ? Is n't that big news ? <p> January 23rd , 0630 . Wake up , get the paper , sit down to breakfast . What 's the news today ? Front page - Mars rover problem , more Tracy Baker problems , anti-porn bill scaring retailers , officer hit by drunk , flip , flip , flip a Page 14 - ' Senate says GOP hacked Dems ' file . ' Hmm . This reminds me of something that happened a long time ago . It also started out with a small item like this . Some hoods broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something like that . <p> Ca n't be too similar , though - The Post would never put a story like that on Page 14 . And a touch of irony - on the facing page , Attorney General John Ashcroft announces that a leading cause of problems is government corruption . Astute , indeed . But he has help - the Senate sergeant at arms has seized the majority leader 's computer , among other items ' of interest . ' Ca n't be too important , though , or The Post would have given the story higher billing a unless a naahh , The Post does n't bury stories . <p> Does it ? <p> WALTER BJORNEBY <p> Greeley <p> Gun bill misunderstood <p> Re : ' Kill the easy-gun bill , ' Jan. 22 editorial . <p> I would like to address some of the misinformation surrounding House Bill 1012 and , perhaps , replace some of the emotion with fact . There is a misunderstanding of not only the content of HB 1012 but also of the law resulting from Amendment 22 . <p> HB 1012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background check for attempting to transfer a firearm at a gun show even though no transfer has been completed . It also removes the confusing definition of a ' collection ' as a ' trade , barter , or in-kind exchange of one or more firearms . ' <p> HB 1012 does not allow firearm transactions started at the gun show to be completed off-premise without a background check . The law clearly states , ' If any part of a firearm transaction takes place at a gun show , no firearm shall be transferred unless a background check has been obtained by a licensed gun dealer . ' <p> HB 1012 does not , and has no intent to , change this requirement . <p> The law as currently written is being ignored for ' attempting to sell ' a firearm because it is unenforceable . If we have a portion of the law that people are allowed to ignore , it breeds contempt for the law , thus diminishing peoples ' confidence in the law . It also allows for ' selective enforcement ' at the discretion of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . We have a responsibility to clarify the language of the law without changing the intent , thus allowing full public confidence in the law and the enforcement thereof . <p> Others have recognized the ambiguities in the original Amendment 22 language . According to a Denver Post editorial of Dec. 27 , 2000 , ' Amendment 22 also has some ambiguities that must be clarified , but we 're confident those issues will be addressed by the legislature and Coloradans will have more confidence in the dealings that go on at gun shows . ' <p> Even Tom Mauser , in his testimony to the House Committee , admitted that ' the ' attempts to transfer ' language was redundant and ambiguous . ' <p> Contrary to The Post 's editorial last week , stating that ' HB 1012 would open a loophole through which lawbreakers could squirm , ' this bill will in fact tighten and clarify language in the current law . <p> State Rep. RAYMOND J. ROSE <p> Montrose <p>  --  Friedman says what needs to be said about Israel <p> Re : ' War of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column . <p> Hooray for Thomas Friedman ! Finally someone has the courage to come forward with a clear assessment of the mess in Israel . <p> Friedman suggests some changes that the U.S. and Israel must make if the killing there is to stop . I would add to his suggestions the following : The U.S. should ' encourage ' Israel to abandon the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza by withholding aid . Further , America should ask the United Nations to send an international force to the region to secure a truce and to oversee the transfer of Israelis from the settlements to Israel . <p> I agree with Friedman that without these changes , Israel is in peril . Our positions are pro-Israel . Unilateral actions by Israel would not only help Israel , but would go a long way toward removing one of the sources of hatred that the Muslim world has for us and would thus lessen terrorism . <p> I know you will get letters calling Friedman and people like me anti-Semitic . That is why so many people are fearful of coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post for letting Friedman say what needed to be said about the situation in Israel . <p> ELEANOR DWIGHT <p> Fort Collins @p#
