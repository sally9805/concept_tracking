Its budget  --  $140 million , not counting the premiere last week on an aircraft carrier in Hawaii  --  is the biggest in human history . Its length  --  three hours  --  is properly epic . Its central sequence  --  the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  --  is an excellent orchestration of today 's best and brightest special effects . The net result of this mighty effort is perhaps predictable : near total inconsequence . <P> Notice , please , that we did n't say Pearl Harbor is a totally terrible movie . It is watchable in a dim , beclouded sort of way . But one rather thinks that a film trying to recapture the romantic raptures and ruptures people suffered as World War II shattered their normality needs to impart a sense of their desperation as tragic possibility suddenly loomed in their lives . <P> This , though , is precisely what this carefully oiled and polished machine lacks . Its problem lies principally , but not exclusively , with its love story . The movie 's makers  --  producer Jerry Bruckheimer , director Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found its heated romance the perfect device to narrow the distance between a great historical happening and today 's essentially antihistorical audience . Pearl Harbor thus spends a lot of time with Rafe McCawley ( Ben Affleck ) and Danny Walker ( Josh Hartnett ) , boyhood pals who grow up to be hot pilots falling in love with the same woman , a Navy nurse named Evelyn Johnson ( Kate Beckinsale ) . Rafe is first in line , but when he goes missing and is presumed dead in the Battle of Britain , Danny , who lands up at Pearl Harbor with Evelyn , fills in for him  --  rather too successfully . Evelyn is pregnant when Rafe comes back from the dead , just in time for Dec. 7 . <P> It requires the Doolittle raid on Japan , four months later , to resolve this romantic conundrum by knocking a corner off the triangle . It requires a lot of patience for an audience to sit through the dithering . They 're nice kids and all that , but they do n't exactly claw madly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday they 're going to be part of " the Greatest Generation " and do n't want to offend Tom Brokaw . Besides , megahistory and personal history never integrate here . <P> That leaves Cuba Gooding Jr . playing a real historical figure , Dorie Miller , for us to root for . Miller was a cook who , though untrained , manned a gun and may have shot down one or two Japanese planes . But his character is merely sketched into the narrative , and the entire assault on Pearl has a curiously abstract air about it . The bodies fly spectacularly when the Arizona is hit , but we do n't know , thus care about , the victims . <P> It 's possible this is a story you ca n't tell from the bottom up . Maybe the real Pearl Harbor tragedy took place in Tokyo and Washington  --  bunches of old guys sitting around talking erroneous geopolitics . They play small roles here , and you ca n't expect anyone to make a big-time movie about their murmured miscalculations . You do , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama that 's missing from this movie . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
