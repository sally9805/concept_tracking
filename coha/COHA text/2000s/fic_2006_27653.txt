The Abortionist 's Daughter By Elisabeth Hyde Random House Elisabeth Hyde The problem was , Megan had just taken the second half of the ecstasy when her father called with the news . Earlier that day , her roommate had bundled up and trudged out into a raging Front Range blizzard to buy two green clover-shaped pills : one for herself , and one for Megan , as a kind of pre-Christmas present . Natalie had meant to wrap them up in a little box . But the day got a little hectic , what with exams and all , so after dinner , when they were back in their dorm room together , Natalie simply dug in her pocket and took out the little pills and without any fanfare set them on the open page of Megan 's biology text . " And do n't wuss , " she warned . Megan screwed up her face . The green pills reminded her of those pastel dots you got when you were a kid , the kind you peel off a long strip of paper . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pills and put them into a clay pinch pot that sat in the back corner of her desk . Lumpy and chipped , the pot looked as though someone had stuck his elbow into a ball of clay . Which is exactly what Ben , her brother , had done , eleven years ago . A major accomplishment , for Ben . But Natalie would n't let the matter go , pointing out that they could start with just half . And so instead of studying for her biology exam as planned , Megan Thompson , pre-medfreshman at the university , found herself giving in to something larger and decidedly more fun that evening . Not only that , but she gave in with no clue as to what had transpired earlier that evening two miles west , in the two-story stucco house she 'd grown up in -- the house that had been on the Home Tour three years in a row , the one that backed up to Open Space , with the model solar heating panels and the evaporative cooling system that kept the temperature inside a mere seventy- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no suspicions , no worries , no funny feelings that might have caused her to think twice , to resist the temptation and opt out of what she knew from experience would be another evening of all-night bliss . Forgetting about everything else -- her exam , the argument with her mother earlier that morning , that last very strange e-mail from Bill -- Megan placed half the pill on her tongue , washed it down with water , and waited . That was at eight o'clock . At eight-thirty they were n't feeling much different . At quarter to nine Natalie wondered if they should take the other half . And it was right after they split the second pill that the phone rang . Natalie recognized the number on Caller ID . " It 's your mother again , " she announced . When Megan did n't reply , Natalie said , " I think you ought to straighten things out . Maybe she changed her mind . Maybe she 'll buy you the plane ticket . I 'm answering it . " She picked up the phone , singing " Yell-low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seated cross-legged on her bed , Megan slumped against the wall . The reason she did n't want to talk to her mother was simple . That morning they 'd argued over whether or not Diana would buy Megan a ticket to Mexico for spring break . Mean things were said -- by both of them -- and Megan shuddered when she recalled how pleased she 'd felt with that last wicked remark about killing babies . Why did it make her feel so good to make her mother feel so bad ? Speaking of feelings , the drug was kicking in and she was beginning to feel pretty good -- so that when Natalie told her it was n't her mother but rather her father on the phone , she felt a welcome surge of love and affection . " That 's my dad , " she said fondly , " wanting to play the guy in the middle . He 's always doing that , you know ? Whenever Mom and I get into a fight , there he is , Mr. Mediator . It was n't even a big fight , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it is n't with him and Mom . Freaks him out to think that she and I --  " " Take the fucking phone , " said Natalie . Megan took the phone and cradled it to her ear . " Hi , Dad . " " Sweetheart , " he began . " It was n't a major fight , " she told him . " Did she tell you ? A bunch of people are going to Mexico . I 'll pay for the ticket , I 'll pay for everything . I did n't mean to lay it all on Mom . " She heard her father clear his throat but felt a rush of apology coming -- not just for things said earlier that day but for all the wrongs she had committed over the course of her nineteen years . " I was rude , " she said . " I should n't have yelled at her . Jesus , it 's Christmas . What was I thinking ? I hate it when I yell . " " Megan , " her father said . Megan stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her heart skip . And it took her less than a second to realize why . It was the voice he 'd used ten years ago , when he 'd called her at summer camp with the news about Ben . " Megan , " he began .  - -   - -   - -   - -   - -  Frank Thompson could n't tell if it was the reflection of pool water bouncing off the windows , or the shriek of his daughter over the phone , or the flapping sound of the sheet as the paramedics covered his wife that made his legs begin to wobble and shake . All he knew was that the ground beneath him was falling out from under , and he had to get down , fast , or he was going to be sick . He squatted , set the phone on the slate floor that Diana had chosen when she put in the pool , and covered his face with his hands . He listened to the pool pump as it sucked and squirted from somewhere underground , and breathed in the moist , chlorinated air that filled the solarium . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring with the paramedics . Next to him lay Diana 's peach-colored bathrobe , along with a pair of purple flip-flops with the darkened imprints of her heels . A shiver passed through him , and he turned his gaze to the water in the pool , which continued to dance as though some ghost were out there sculling in the middle . It was a small elevated pool , framed in by blond birch panels -- not much bigger than two hot tubs end to end , really , with a motorized current that allowed Diana to swim nonstop without having to turn . Although he had n't wanted to put the pool in , he 'd later conceded to one of his colleagues that it was a worthy investment , since it gave his high-strung wife a chance to come home and mellow out . After twenty years of marriage , he knew that a mellow Diana was a cohabitable Diana . Frank lifted his head , and a sparkle of light caught his eye from underneath the ficus tree across the room . Broken glass , needly shards -- and Frank cringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass across the room to get his wife 's attention . It was wrong of him , he knew that . But after coming across the pictures online -- pictures that no father should have to imagine , let alone see -- well , everyone has a breaking point , and it was the way Diana was so oblivious to the problem at hand , the way she assumed he was upset because she 'd skipped out on lunch earlier that day : he felt his shoulders clench , and the glass just flew . Three clicks . It would seem that a man in Frank Thompson 's position , with over twenty years ' experience as a prosecuting attorney , would know better than to start tampering with things in a room with a dead person . A man in his position would get out of that room and call his own attorney . But Frank did n't have his wits about him at the moment , certainly not his professional wits , and all he could think was that broken glass would convey the wrong impression about his marriage . ( Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the gratification was unmatched , like saying shit or fuck in front of small children . ) Rising stiffly , he walked over to a little poolside closet to get a broom and dustpan . Nobody seemed to notice him ; the patrol officer was on her cell phone and the paramedics were conferring with each other . As if making up for all the times during their marriage that he had n't cleaned up after himself , he knelt down and swept up the ficus leaves and shards of glass and emptied them into a wastebasket . He did n't want people to have the wrong impression . Outside , a blast of grainy snow pelted the sliding-glass doors . Now the cop and the paramedics were kneeling beside Diana 's body . " That 's not good , " the cop said , glancing up . She was new on the force , blond and blue-eyed like someone straight off a farm in Minnesota ; but she already had that bossy , black and white air that you find in cops , and older siblings . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Frank . " Come see , " said the cop . " If you get down , you can see better . " Reluctantly , Frank squatted . He had n't looked at Diana since the paramedics had arrived . They held the sheet away from her head , and Frank , who 'd harbored the lay belief that maybe it was all a mistake , now forced himself to look . For all the times he 'd seen a dead body -- and there were plenty , his having been with the district attorney 's office for twenty-four years -- nothing could compare to this . His wife 's dark corkscrew curls fanned away from her face , Medusa-like . Her skin was white and waxy , her lips the color of plums . Her eyes stared up , flat and fishy . He looked away . " What concerns us is this , " the cop said , and she nodded to the younger of the two paramedics , a man with a long straggly ponytail . Gently taking Diana 's head in both hands , he turned it slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " said the cop . " You see ? " What he saw made him choke . The bruise was huge and ripe and living , a fat , blue-gray slug in her tangled hair . " Any idea how this happened ? " the cop asked Frank . Numbly Frank shook his head . " Well , it 's some bruise , " the cop said . " Hard to imagine what could have made a bruise like that . And look at those knuckles . " Frank heard himself suggest that she 'd perhaps fallen . " Maybe it 's that simple , " said the cop , " but I 'm calling the coroner . " Frank stared at the cop , and for the first time he recalled that on two separate occasions he 'd had her on the witness stand ; both times she 'd not flinched when the defense attorney had implied she was a forgetful , inattentive liar . "  - -  crime scene from now on , " she added . " Frank , you need to have a seat . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Frank , " she said , " your wife is a national figure . There are a lot of people out there who do n't like what she does . " " Could she have been swimming too fast ? " the older paramedic asked . " Maybe she swam into the edge of the pool . " " This is two-four-oh-five , " the cop was saying into her radio . " Where 's Mark ? I need backup now . " Frank just stared at the three of them . " Or maybe she tripped and hit her head and fell into the pool , " suggested the paramedic . Frank could n't answer . It was n't sinking in . He looked at his wife 's face . The night before , she 'd been complaining about the frown lines between her eyebrows ; now her forehead was perfectly smooth and unlined . The night before , she 'd informed him that for the past five years she 'd been coloring her hair without his knowing ; now for the first time he noticed that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to tell her how beautiful she was , how young she looked , but the words kept catching on little fishhooks in his throat . What had he said earlier that afternoon ? Something about photo ops and Ben ? The great Dr. Duprey , he 'd said . Now he cringed , recalling his words , and he bent down and rested his cheek against hers , wanting to take back everything he 'd said that afternoon . He might as well have tried to take back his wedding vows . " I 'm sorry , " he whispered into her ear . " I 'm so , so sorry . "
