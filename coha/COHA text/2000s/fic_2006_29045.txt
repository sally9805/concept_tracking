Moonlight Hotel By Scott Anderson Random House Scott Anderson One She was leaning on the balcony railing , staring into the night , and David saw how her bare arms shone white , like marble or bone , from the lights of the house . She turned to look at him over her shoulder , tossing her blond hair as she did so . She smiled . " You must have the best view in Kutar , " she said . David set their drinks on the railing , leaned like her , gazed out at what she saw . " One of them , I guess , " he said . They were on the back balcony of the house . The land fell away abruptly at that point on the ridgeline , giving the illusion at night that one was perched on the edge of a steep cliff . The airport and northern suburbs were below them , and then the desert began , a great darkness broken only by an occasional vehicle coming over the national highway and a few bright lights in the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought those lights were of isolated homes , homes he could never make out during the day , until his telescope arrived and he discovered they were stars low on the horizon . He looked to her and told her this . She was very pretty in a wholesome , middle-America kind of way : striking eyes somewhere between blue and gray , a pleasant mouth , the emerald-green sheath dress suited her pale skin . He had forgotten her name . Julia , possibly , or maybe Janine . Shetook a perfunctory sip from her drink , glanced at her wristwatch . " I should probably get going . Corinne will get worried . " David knew this was the time for him to say something-really , most anything would do . Instead he looked back out at the desert . An upland breeze brought sounds from the northern suburbs : car horns , the rhythmic clang of metal , the whine of a truck laboring over Gowarshad Pass . From somewhere down the ridge came the baying of a wolf . David had heard the coastal range was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one found in this part of the world-but he had yet to see one personally . It was her green dress that he had first noticed at the party ; even now , in what passed for early autumn in Kutar , most foreigners wore shades of white on account of the heat . Corinne , the wife of the political attache , had waved David over and introduced her cousin , just in from Chicago for a visit , with a sly expression . Janine ? Perhaps it was Jennifer . At the balcony , he pointed into the dark , off to the east . " The sun comes up right over there . At first the desert is pink , then orange . Then it turns to gold . " He lowered his arm , turned to her . " You should stay and watch the sunrise . " He saw the way her hand tightened on the railing , she gave a nervous little laugh . " I do n't know , " she said . " What would Corinne think ? " David smiled , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to think . Corinne would be far more surprised if her cousin from Chicago actually made the journey back down the mountain tonight . He did n't say this , though . " You can call her , " he said , " tell her you want to see the sunrise . " She reached for her glass again , but stopped , her lips quivering in an uncertain way . He leaned in to kiss her lightly on the jaw . " You should stay , " he whispered . He kissed her again , a bit lower this time , on her throat , and he felt her sharp intake of breath , her tensing . She smelled of gardenia and rose and something astringent , and she tilted her head back to make room for him . By the bed , he watched her undress , felt a tug of something almost like sadness at the careful way she removed the green dress and draped it over a chairback . Afterward , with her sleeping beside him , David gazed up at his bedroom ceiling and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low thrum of the city , the odd creaks of the house ; the wolf was quiet now . He felt her breath , hot and regular , on his neck . He smiled in the dark , struck by the incongruous thought that her breaths on his throat were meant to serve a purpose , as if he were some inflatable object that needed air . With this thought , he considered kissing her-the top of her head was just an inch from his mouth , her hair brushed his lips-but he did n't want to wake her . Instead , after a time he moved out of her embrace , the warm breath on his throat was gone , because what had started out as a humorous image had become a bit unsettling , and he silently rose from the bed and went back outside . He looked to the east , as if for the first traces of dawn , even though he knew this was still a long way off . The Monday morning staff meeting began at 10:30 . David arrived a bit early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat facing the windows and the embassy 's inner courtyard . Though he could n't see the courtyard garden from that vantage point-the conference room was on the third floor-some of the upper branches of the trees were visible , and he liked having them to gaze at when the meetings went long . The others began filing in shortly after , singly or in pairs , and David said a few words of greeting to each . To his surprise , Bill Myerson sat directly across from him . David could n't recall him ever sitting there before , and he wondered if it signified something . He nodded at Bill , then opened one of his file folders and pretended to scan its contents . Ambassador Draper strode in precisely on time and made for his chair at the head of the table . Flipping to a blank page in his notebook , he took a silver pen from his shirt pocket , looked along the table with a knowing smile . " Well , " he said , " I just read over the NSA 's situation report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us again . " There were polite chuckles at the ambassador 's favorite-and at this point , somewhat tired-opening joke . Every Sunday , the National Security Agency cabled a classified report to all overseas missions listing any potential crises-military unrest , labor strikes , the failing health of a head of state-that might be cause for concern somewhere in the world that week . Over the course of a year , a particularly troubled country might garner dozens of such citations , but this was not the case with Kutar ; before his own posting there , David had checked the NSA index and discovered the kingdom had n't even been mentioned in nearly a decade . " So let 's do it , " John Draper said , and turned to the man on his immediate right , the agricultural , commercial , and economic attache , Lee Warren . Because the American mission to Kutar was so small-nine officials , a support staff of some two dozen , the eight Marine Guards-all the traditional diplomatic portfolios were handled by a mere four attaches . This rarely caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kutar had virtually no external commerce to speak of , its role in the global economy was largely theoretical , and for the attaches the consolidation held the benefit of making them eligible for a wider range of postings in the future . As usual , Lee spoke for only a few minutes , and then it was the turn of Cheryl Thompson , the consular officer . Cheryl reported that her office had received 112 new visa applications during the previous week , but had processed 163-9 approvals , 154 rejections-as it tried to pare down the backlog . This brought an approving nod from the ambassador . " Excellent , " he said . " At this rate , we should be pretty well caught up by Christmas . " " I should think so , " Cheryl replied . It was , in fact , Kutar 's very insignificance that had made Ambassador Draper 's arrival six months earlier a bit puzzling . Not yet forty-five , his rise through the Foreign Service up to that point had been steady and swift , so there was considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up there . Some speculated he was being groomed for a more sensitive post in the region , and thus " paying his dues , " but at least as many suspected he had made an enemy of someone important at State and was suffering retribution . For his part , John Draper never let on that he was anything but thrilled to be in Kutar-which , of course , was itself the sign of a good diplomat . In any event , David had taken a quick liking to Draper , as had most of the staff . Handsome , with the lanky frame of a former athlete , the ambassador exuded an energy and optimism that was refreshing . With his attractive wife , Susan , and their three polite children , the Drapers seemed the very essence of a diplomatic family-charming , earnest , easy with all kinds of people-the sort that could be relied upon to cast the United States in a positive light abroad . And even if the vigor he brought to the post seemed a tad excessive-the previous ambassador had found once-a-month staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the torpor of the place . " And the king thinks he 'll get everyone on board with it ? " John Draper was following up on some issue raised by Harold Derwinski , the political attache , the details of which David had missed . " I 'd say it 's still in the talking phase , " Harold replied . " There 's liable to be some grumbling from the traditionalists , but it 's got a lot of support with the technocrats . " " Good , " the ambassador said , " let 's keep on top of that . " As the meeting wore on , David looked to the tree branches beyond Bill Myerson 's head . What passed for winter in Kutar-a misting rain , an ocean-borne wind-would n't start for at least another three months , and until then even the slenderest of limbs would barely move in the still air of the enclosed garden ; the little leaves would wear their brown coats of dust . Beyond the tree branches and the embassy roof , he saw the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods of Laradan , cascades of white houses that from this distance looked rather like mottled snow . He knew he could n't see his own home from the conference room-it was off to the right and blocked by an office building-but he looked in that direction anyway . " Bill ? " the ambassador called . David turned to see Bill Myerson staring fixedly at him from across the table , his mind clearly far away . " Bill ? Anything ? " The ambassador tried again . This brought the deputy chief of mission back with a start . " Sorry , John . No , nothing . " Bill reddened , stole an embarrassed glance at David , then looked back down the long table to John Draper . " Sorry , " he muttered again . The ambassador nodded , continued on . The speaking role finally fell to David , the foreign aid and development officer . " Not much to report , " he said , scanning the papers before him as if to make sure he was n't overlooking something . " The piping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's getting back up to speed . And there 's going to be a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new high school in Ansara Sunday after next ; naturally , they 'd love it if you could chopper in for it . " John Draper nodded . " Anything from the geologists ? " " I spoke with them on Thursday , " David replied . " They said they might be a few more weeks yet . " This brought a sigh of frustration from the ambassador . A year ago , the U.S. Geological Survey had issued a report theorizing that , based on rock-strata mappings , the northern mountains of Kutar might conceal a large reservoir of water , an aquifer that , if tapped , could make farming possible in that desolate region . A team of American geologists had been sent into the mountains to take water-table readings , but what was supposed to have been a two-month mission was already well into its fourth . " This thing is kind of dragging out , is n't it ? " John Draper said . David nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's all hard-rock . " " Hard-rock ? " " It slows down the drilling a lot . You 're always having to replace the drill bits . " The ambassador pondered this with a frown . " I just do n't like the idea of those guys being stuck out there in the middle of nowhere indefinitely . " But then whatever worries he had seemed to pass ; he looked to David with a smile . " Still , it 'd really be something for Kutar if it plays out , would n't it ? " What the ambassador did n't know , or perhaps chose to ignore , was that the aquifer theory was but the latest in a long series which had bestowed all manner of imagined riches on the northern mountains over the years-gold , titanium , manganese , there had even been talk of oil at one time-and that each had ultimately proven to be wrong . Certainly the water theory looked more promising than most of the previous ones , but the high stack of disappointing geological reports David kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed him to at least entertain the dispiriting notion that this impoverished region of Kutar might , in fact , already be living up to its full potential on the planet . The Monday morning staff meeting did n't seem the place to bring this up , though . " Yes , " David smiled back at the ambassador , " that really would be something . " As the gathering was breaking up , Harold Derwinski called their attention one last time . " Just a reminder about the reception at the Swiss ambassador 's tonight . " He shot a respectful glance at John Draper . " Now I know there 've been a lot of these functions lately , we 've all got busy lives , but the Swiss are pretty important allies , so it 'd be nice to have a good turnout . " " Allies ? " Stan Peterson cocked an eyebrow in mock surprise . " I thought this thing was to celebrate Swiss neutrality . " The ambassador chuckled . " I think you know what he means , Stan . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good point , Harry . Thanks for the reminder . " The city of Laradan was ancient , although precisely how ancient had never been determined . For at least the first two thousand years of its existence , settlement had been confined to the bluff just above the harbor , and what had been created over that time was a sprawling warren of three- and four-story whitewashed buildings and winding alleys , churches and mosques and little plazas . It was for this area-the Old City-that Laradan was famous , to the extent that it was famous at all , and in which the few foreign tourists who found their way to Kutar concentrated their activities . At the western end of the Old City was the palace compound , and then began the New City , an orderly grid of right-angle streets and Mediterranean-style office buildings constructed by the British in the 1880s and fronting on the half-moon of Serenity Bay .
