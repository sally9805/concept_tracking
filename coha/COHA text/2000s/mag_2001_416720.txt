The anti free-trade demonstrations showed that energy , humor , and plenty of women leaders can change the world // FOR THE NEXT ANTI-GLOBALization demonstration , I 'm bringing a gas mask . I like to be where the action is , and these days you need protection , even in Canada . One of the effects of globalization is that countries become more and more alike . The violent confrontations in April between the police and protesters in Quebec City during the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) summit were unsettlingly like the Battle of Seattle . But unlike Seattle , the script for this confrontation was written in advance , with the construction of a hideous tenfoot-high concrete and chain link fence built around one of the most beautiful cities in North America . At least six thousand police officers were more than ready to rumble in the largest show of force that Canada has witnessed in a generation . Within 48 hours , police shot nearly 5,000 canisters of tear gas and more than 800 rubber and plastic bullets . Approximately four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail . For the protesters , the vast majority of whom remained peaceful in the face of extraordinary police provocation , it was a life-changing experience . We thought we lived in a democracy , however imperfect . But what we experienced that weekend was a police state . If you watched it on television , you probably saw people throwing rocks and assumed there was a riot going on . But as usual , the demonstrators ' story was far more peaceful and hopeful than the one the media depicted . The march began at Laval University , about six miles from the hated fence . It was lively and creative , and included a replica of a medieval catapult , pulled by 12 " slaves . " It periodically hurled teddy bears into the crowd and later , at the police . One woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty walked all the way on stilts . Another group of women , The Dandelions , wore T-shirts with painted slogans like " Persistent Radical Blossom That Will Always Bloom . " The march was colorful and noisy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crowd were remarkable to this experienced activist . There was no riot by the demonstrators in Quebec City that day , just a boisterous demonstration made up of people who insisted on their right to be on the streets . Quebec City is built on two levels . Throughout the Upper City , the stink and sting of tear gas was everywhere . I suppose that the police thought they could clear the crowd with the gas . They were wrong . Despite the pain , protesters refused to move . People ran to side streets to clear their eyes and then returned to the scene of the major confrontation . As the police 's use of gas , water cannons , and concussion bombs increased , more and more protesters resorted to rock throwing . But even at the height of the retaliation , there were no more than a hundred people battling the police directly . Mostly , the tear gas united everyone .

Photograph Demonstrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest their lack of voice in trade talks . // What struck Maude Barlow , chair of the Council of Canadians , a citizen 's group that has been battling free-trade agreements since the first one negotiated between Canada and the U.S. in the 1980s , was " the absolute courage . People took tear gas and stayed . We faced police brutality and stood our ground . " Barlow responded to media criticism of the demonstrators ' violence-which was blown out of proportion-in a speech on Saturday : " These are young people born into a toxic economy , a society that deliberately sorts winners from losers and measures its success by the bottom line of its corporations , not by the well-being of its young . These youth are the result of years of poisonous economic and trade policies that have created an entrenched underclass , with no access to the halls of power except by putting their bodies on the line . Their anger is our collective societal responsibility , The question is n't what I am going to do with angry young people . The question should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush and all the other leaders here to promote the extension of this toxic economy : what are you going to do with them ? " In Canada , as in the U.S. , youth are angry and mobilizing . Ever since Seattle , I 've noticed an extraordinary increase in youth activism . As someone who was part of the last great youth radicalization in the 1960s , I can see all the signs . But this is not the 1960s . For one thing , you can see the influence of feminism on this new radicalization . Easily , half the leaders and participants are female , and it 's not just among the youth . Francoise David , president of the Quebec Women 's Federation , which led the organizing for the World March of Women last year , says that feminists are solidly involved in the leadership of this new movement . For David , the Tribunal on Women and Globalization was the most memorable event in the weeklong protest against the Summit of the Americas . The tribunal was part of the People 's Summit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas . Women from the North and the South gave testimony about the impact of corporate globalization on their lives . " Whether it was our presence on the stage , in the workshops , or in the streets , women were highly visible and active , " David told me . " The final declaration of the People 's Summit also reflected a feminist analysis . " But it 's not just the presence of feminists that struck me as unique ; it was how brave , militant , and polite the young people were . On Friday afternoon , after two hours of tear gas assaults , I saw two young men running away from the gas , screaming in pain . They had on goggles to protect their eyes . " Get the goggles off , " I yelled at them so that their eyes could be cleared by the fresh air . " I know , " one yelled back . Then he took off the goggles and looked at me and said , " But thank you for your concern . " Can these young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercialism , and economics to the detriment of the needs of the earth and the people who live on it ? The last youth rebellion helped spawn the women 's movement , the lesbian and gay rights movements , and the environmental movement , and ended a war . This one , it seems to me , is more radical , more feminist ( that would n't be hard ) , more sophisticated , more diverse , and much , much nicer . What 's more , it is not as isolated from mainstream society . In Quebec , union members mobilized in even greater numbers than the youth . On Saturday a march of around fifty thousand people , led by the unions but including a wide array of organizations , wound its way through the streets of the Lower City . But lots of the union members wanted to be up at the perimeter with the youth . " Next time , youth and labor will be together in the direct action , " promised Judy Darcy , national president of the largest union in Canada . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march showed that 21 percent of Canadians said they would have gone to Quebec City to be part of the protest against the FTAA if they could . In Canada , massive opposition to free-trade agreements began with the struggle against the one signed in 1989 with the U.S. In Mexico , most people have seen their incomes fall since NAFTA was enacted in 1994 . There are similar statistics for Canada , and even the U.S. Only a small elite are benefiting from the social-service cutbacks , deregulation , privatization , and tax cuts that are features of this toxic economy . But what is most dangerous about NAFTA is its infamous Chapter 11 that allows corporations to sue governments over regulations or policies that interfere with their profits . Take for example , Metalclad , a U.S. waste management company that sued Mexico when a local government refused permission for a hazardous waste treatment and disposal site inside a nature preserve , of all places . The final FTAA and renegotiated World Trade Organization agreements on trade in services will almost certainly contain provisions similar to Chapter 11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been some victories . Popular opposition scuttled the Multilateral Agreement on Investment created in 1998 by corporate representatives of 29 countries . And the WTO is so worried about popular activism , its next meeting will be held in Qatar , an autocratic nation where the king does n't typically allow protests . While we continue to protest the secrecy of trade negotiations , it 's clear that much more is at stake . What we are seeing is a vast and diverse movement to take back democratic control from corporations . This anti-globalization movement is about democracy and the right of people to participate in the decisions that are made on their behalf That 's why the wall in Quebec City became the target of protest , and why those who participate in the demonstrations , whether in Quebec , Seattle , Prague , Buenos Aires , or Washington , will continue to organize at home . The desire for democracy has always been a dream that inspires people to put their bodies , and even their lives , on the line . A new generation around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and I do n't think anything will stop them . Author Affiliation Judy Rebick is the editor of rabble.ca , a new interactive online magazine .
