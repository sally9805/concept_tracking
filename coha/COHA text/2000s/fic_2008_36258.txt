NO REASON <p> THE MORNING RIPENED SLOWLY . TEN O'CLOCK FELT LIKE NOON . July Montgomery cut open a sack of ground feed and poured it into the cement trough . He looked out of the barn window into his hay field , where a low-lying fog stole silently out of the ground , filling space with milky distance . Beyond the fence , the tops of maple , oak , and hickory formed a lumpy , embroidered edge against infinity . <p> July had lived here for more than twenty years , but because of the dreamy quality of the morning , the landscape now appeared almost unfamiliar . The row of round bales of hay-which he 'd placed near the road only weeks before-seemed foreign and completely removed from any history that included him . The road itself looked different , and when a hawk stepped off a utility pole , opened its wings , and sailed up the blacktop road toward the nearby village of Words , it disappeared into the looming fog as though entering another world . July marveled at how easily the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be changed by a little moisture in the atmosphere . <p> On the other side of the barn he could hear his small dairy herd hurrying back from the pasture . He had let them out just an hour before , and it seemed odd that they would be coming back . Normally , they preferred to graze all day , knee-deep in grass , even in the most inclement weather . <p> Several cows anxiously butted their heads against the wooden sides of the building and he opened the doors , allowing them back into the barn . Agitated , they bellowed and crowded against each other , milling nervously from one area to the next , swarming in slow motion . <p> Something had frightened them , and July stood in the opening and searched for an explanation-a pack of dogs , perhaps . But he could see nothing , and indeed it was n't always possible to identify the reason for a herd 's agitation . Like the fear that often seizes human society , it sometimes had no tangible cause . Given the social nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a single limbic system and spread into the surrounding neighborhood , communicated with the speed of a startled flock of birds . Before long , a climate of fear was established , perpetuated through the psyche 's network of instinctual rumor . <p> A movement caught his eye . Several hundred yards away , at the very edge of where the fog swallowed objects wholesale , a large black animal jumped the fence into his hay field , turned around in an almost ritual manner , and looked directly at him . <p> Now there 's something , July thought , staring back . It appeared to be a very big cat , a panther , also known as a cougar , puma , or mountain lion . He 'd seen them out west and up north , but never here . Though they had once been native to the area , there had been no reports of them , as far as he knew , for generations . It was n't even necessary to actually see one , of course ; a stray scent of the beast-inhaled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moving slowly , the panther paced with elastic ease along the old fence , carefully measuring its distance from the barn , keeping partially hidden in the fog , like a ghost not willing to assume corporeal form . As it moved , it continued to stare at July , and July continued to look back . <p> He wondered why a panther would reenter an area its ancestors had long ago abandoned . The larger reasons , of course , included the encroachment of human civilization and depletion of natural habitat ; but July wondered what the urge itself must have felt like-from the inside-to compel it to leave its familiar haunts . If it was a male , the pursuit of a female might lure it into the unknown ; a female , on the other hand , might venture out in search of food or the protective seclusion needed to raise its young . July also imagined that both male and female might , like some people , simply enter an unknown area for the sake of discovering how it compared with what they already knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegantly on the edge of the woods , July also saw no reason to deny to the creature the possibility of acting without a compelling motivation . Perhaps it ended up in his hay field without knowing why it had come . <p> July remembered his own journey to the Driftless Region , more than twenty years ago . <p> He recalled first that nothing had hurt . He 'd woken up in a surprisingly comfortable ditch along an unrecognizable road in the middle of the night , near the end of September , somewhere in Wyoming . The stars seemed especially thick and chaotic above him , brilliant but mixed up , as though they had been stirred with a silver oar . He had no memory of how he 'd come to be here-wherever here was-and he felt to see if some parts of his body were perhaps broken , bleeding , or missing . But nothing seemed out of place , and nothing hurt . <p> After more checking , he discovered that his wallet was missing . And his duffel bag , lying next to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of his personal belongings-rope , stove , cooking utensils , hatchet , knife , compass , lantern , bourbon , dried food , candy bars , matches , soap , maps , and a couple books-were gone . All that remained were a couple items of clothing , his sleeping bag , and his water bottle . <p> But nothing hurt and that seemed like a good omen . Things could be much worse . Whoever had left him here had not found the flat canvas money belt tied snuggly around his abdomen . He then fell back to sleep and woke up an hour later at the sound of an approaching vehicle . <p> A pickup moved east along the highway . It was closely followed by a noisy single-axle trailer , pulled by a bumper hitch . As though extending a carpet of light before its path-a carpet it never actually rode on-the truck came to a rattling stop at the nearby inter section . The driver climbed out and walked back to check on the trailer . Cramped from sitting and arthritic with age , he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the ditch , and joined the old man at the trailer . <p> " Everything all right ? " he asked . <p> The old man seemed startled at not being alone and warily inspected July and the duffel bag extending from his left arm . <p> " So far , so good , " he said , and resumed shining his flashlight through the open slats in the side of the trailer . The dense circle of yellow light moved over a massive Angus bull . The animal 's warm smell had a sweet yet acrid quality and when it shifted its weight from one set of legs to another , the trailer groaned respectfully . <p> July walked to the other side of the road and urinated on the gravel shoulder . <p> It was a clear , summerlike night , and the sky glowed with unusual green luminance . <p> The spilling sound reminded the old man of his own full bladder and he also peed on the edge of the road . Far in the distance a dog barked . <p> " You need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the driver adjusted his billed hat and lit a cigarette . July shoved the duffel bag under the seat and sat beside him . " Where you going ? " he asked . <p> " Wisconsin . Ever been there ? " <p> " Nope , " said July . <p> As they rode through Wyoming , the old man explained that he and his brother kept a herd of Herefords in southwestern Wisconsin . They wanted to breed up some black baldy calves , and the old man had driven out to the stockyards in Cheyenne , looking for a long yearling with eye appeal . At a late auction , he 'd bought one . <p> July liked the way the old man talked-his accent and choice of phrases . On this basis he decided to continue with him . <p> " How long you been in Wyoming ? " the old man asked . <p> " Eight or nine months , working on a ranch . " <p> " You from around here ? " <p> " Nope . " <p> " Where you from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to Wisconsin , though . " <p> " Where were you before you were in Wyoming ? " asked the old man , openly exhibiting the interest of someone who currently lived in the same house he had grown up in . <p> " Unloading ships on the docks in California . " <p> " And before that ? " <p> " Hauling wheat in Canada , " July said . His window was open and the warm night air blew against the side of his face . " I spent almost a year in the prairie provinces , driving truck . While I was there I met a man , a logger with a plastic leg who could run faster than anyone I 'd ever seen . And at night he 'd take off his leg and count the money hidden inside it . Other people were always betting him he could n't outrun them . " <p> " How 'd he lose his leg ? " <p> " Cut it off by mistake with a chain saw , above the knee . " <p> It was the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they do not expect to see the person they 're talking to again-stories about other people , maybe true and maybe not . It was good-natured talk , well suited to the thin , fleeting comfort shared by strangers . Ghost talk . <p> They traded driving in South Dakota and continued all the way into Wisconsin , where the old man began to anticipate returning to his brother and their farm more eagerly . <p> " It 's not that far now , " he said . " Only about twenty miles past the next town . My brother should be waiting up for us . The coffeepot will on and we can have a real meal . " <p> The trailer rattled loudly after running over a large pothole in the pavement , and the old man stopped at the deserted intersection and went back to check on his young bull . It was dark , and after looking at the tires , he inspected the interior of the trailer with his flashlight . <p> July got out and stretched . <p> When the old man climbed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the large canvas duffel bag from under the seat . He pulled the strap over his shoulder . <p> " Thanks again for the ride . " <p> " My place is just a little ways ahead . Look , my offer for a place to sleep is good . " <p> " Thanks , but , well , no thanks . " <p> " At least let me drive you into Grange . I do n't feel right leaving you here in the middle of the night . " <p> The young man looked away . He was uncomfortable with not complying with the older man 's wishes yet remained determined to be on his own . " Where does that road go ? " he asked , nodding north . <p> " To Words-nothing up there but a handful of houses . Look , my brother will be waiting for me . Our place is only a little ways from here . You can spend the night , and in the morning- " <p> " I wonder why they put so many stop signs here ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " I really appreciate the ride . " <p> Smiling , he closed the door . <p> " Wait , " said the old man . " The sandwiches-there are a couple left . You paid for them . " And he handed a greasy , lumpy paper sack through the open window . <p> July tucked it under his arm . " Well , thanks again , and goodnight . " <p> He stood in the middle of the road and watched the glowing taillights move beyond his sight . The clanking and banging sounds of the trailer faded and disappeared . A grinning yellow moon dissolved all the stars around it and threw a greenish- blue glow over the countryside . <p> July set his pack down and took out a denim jacket , replacing it with the paper sack . <p> " Okay , " he said , " which way now ? " He had n't thought further ahead than this unknown intersection . <p> He stood in the middle of the road wondering which way to go , waiting for some inspiration-a beckoning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Words was good enough . <p> His boots made clumping sounds against the road 's hard surface , which continued north in a meandering manner up and down hills . Moonlit fields of standing corn , hay , and soybeans merged with evergreen and hardwood , marshland and streams . Crickets , frogs , owls , and other nocturnal creatures called out to him as he passed . Of particular notice were the unidentifiable cries-the raw sounds of nature that refused to be firmly associated with mammal , fowl , or insect . <p> Set off from the road , an occasional yard light burned near a barn . The houses themselves remained dark , their occupants sleeping . <p> It had been some time since he 'd been in the Midwest , and July attempted to picture himself in the central part of the United States once again . He 'd been born just southwest of Wisconsin , in Iowa , so this seemed like a homecoming of sorts , or as much of one as his habitual homelessness could imagine . <p> In the distance a firefly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location . Once it was out of the hills , it advanced more earnestly , then disappeared for a longer time , only to float up into view a mile away . The single light rounded a corner and divided into two parts , accompanied by a harsh , rushing sound . then the headlights grew brighter , bigger , and louder , like an instinct merging into consciousness . <p> July stepped off the road , behind a stand of honeysuckle . He 'd become accustomed to his own company again and did not wish to share it with anyone or explain where he was going when he did n't know himself . <p> After he had been walking for another half-hour , the faint yellow glow of a town in the near distance cautioned him to wait for morning before going further . He began looking for a place to pass the night . <p> Beyond the Words Cemetery a collection of old-growth trees ran downhill away from the road . He walked between several dozen gravestones , climbed the woven wire fence , picked his way through mulberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land covered with long grass , sheltered by an overhanging maple . In places , the moonlight fell through the branches and spotted the ground . The thick underbrush he hoped would announce the movement of any large intruders , and the rising slope of the cemetery blocked the view from the road . A short distance further down the hill , the rhythmic burbles of a stream could be heard . <p> July unrolled his sleeping bag . He folded his denim jacket for use as a pillow and ate one of the sandwiches from the paper sack . Then he drank from the water bottle , took off his boots , put his socks inside them , lay down , and zipped himself inside . He loosened the money belt that contained his savings from the past five or six years . somewhere in the distance a barred owl loosed its mocking cry , " Who-cooks-for-you , **29;1464;TOOLONG . " The light from an occasional star found its way through the tree above him , blinking on and off with the shuttered movement of leaves in the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences of the past several days in a reasonable perspective : the drive from Wyoming , the wandering conversation with the old man , the walk down the mostly deserted road . The dark foliage above him seemed to draw nearer and a spirit of fatigue invaded his senses , disrupting his review of recent events . Blocking it out , he focused his attention and struggled for several long minutes to keep the images in his mind from sliding through the cellar door of nonsensical stories , and fell asleep . <p> Hours later , he woke up with sudden , blunt finality . He knew why four stop signs had been placed on a remote intersection : there had been an accident . Some time ago , people had died at the crossing and two extra stop signs had been put there . They were erected as memorials . <p> And so it was : the dead forever change the living . Even those unknown to the dead are required to stop . <p> The sky was still mostly dark , but morning stirred beneath the horizon and birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conversing through murmured chirping . <p> Climbing from the sleeping bag , he put on his socks and boots , unfolded his jacket , and siphoned his arms through the sleeves . <p> Why had he come here , he wondered , and walked down the hill . At the stream , he sat on the bank and stared into the dark water . <p> The air-warm and thick-filled with noises , and mingled with burbling water , rustling birds , and the dry ruckus of squirrels came the distant sounds of humans . Doors slammed , vehicles started , and an occasional , indecipherable , barking voice could be heard . A heavy truck moved along the road beyond the cemetery . <p> Why had he come here ? <p> Not everything has a reason , he told himself . His arrival amounted to a whim of circumstance , a living accident . In the same random manner he had arrived in Chicago , Sioux Falls , Cheyenne , San Francisco , Moose Jaw , and many other places . There was no reason . <p> At least this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he could no longer quite believe it . He now suspected that somewhere between his actions and what he knew about them-in that vast chasm of burgeoning silence-grew a nameless need , pushing him from one place to the next . <p> Something shiny near the water 's edge caught his attention and he investigated . <p> A rusty flashlight , half covered in dead grass and dried mud . Most of the chrome had been chipped or worn off , the cylinder dented in several places . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
