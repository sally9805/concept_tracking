IN THIS CORNER OF NEW MEXICO , ONLY NUNS AND FARMERS got up before sunrise every day of the week . Sister Agatha took her customary place in the last pew of the old adobe chapel at Our Lady of Hope Monastery . The voices of her cloistered sisters behind the partition rose in an angelic blend of altos and sopranos , praising God with one heart . <p> Extern nuns like Sister Agatha were the monastery 's lifeblood . Sisters who had not taken a vow of enclosure , they kept the monastery running smoothly by handling necessary duties like shopping and greeting visitors . <p> The externs worshiped in the public section of the chapel where she was this morning . Looking around , Sister Agatha noted that the uncloistered section of the chapel was nearly empty . Only five of their regulars from town had come to six-thirty Mass this Sunday . Masses in town started at eight  --  practically midmorning to Sister Agatha  --  and those services were far more appealing to those who wanted a leisurely breakfast before venturing out . <p> Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen " as Father Rick Mahoney ended his greeting . Knowing that one of their regulars was missing but would soon arrive , Sister Agatha glanced back at the tall entrance doors . One thing that could be said about Jane Sanchez was that she had perfect timing . The woman always came in right before the first reading  --  the last possible minute that still allowed her to meet her Sunday obligation . <p> In her midfifties , hardworking , and devout , Jane seemed to be a good wife to her husband , Louis . Although they were usually together whenever Sister Agatha met them in town , Jane normally came to Mass alone . <p> As the reading from Acts began  --  Jane had cut it too close today  --  Sister Agatha heard a car outside , then a door slam . She listened for the sound of heels on the steps outside but instead heard a hollow snap , like someone with gum blowing a bubble . <p> Last Friday , Jane had called the monastery and spoken to Sister Agatha briefly . Something had disturbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone , afraid she 'd be overheard . Too busy to meet with her that day , Sister Agatha had convinced her to stop by the parlor on Saturday , but Jane had n't shown up . <p> A former journalist , Sister Agatha was always energized by cryptic calls , and she was really curious now . Jane 's problem probably had something to do with her relatives . She did n't get along with her daughter or son-in-law and had recently sought out counseling from Father Mahoney . Sister Agatha had speculated that Jane had been dissatisfied with Father 's take on whatever had happened and now wanted a woman 's perspective . <p> Sister Agatha glanced back at the doors . She was looking forward to finally resolving the mystery of what Jane had seen . With effort , Sister Agatha pushed all distractions from her mind , faced front , and focused on the Eucharistic celebration . Soon Jane faded from her thoughts . <p> Early morning Mass tended to have very short sermons , and Father Mahoney used shorter Eucharistic prayers then , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mass usually lasted forty-five to fifty minutes . <p> Once Mass had ended , Sister Agatha stepped outside , and as she stood on the front steps , Mrs. Lenzi joined her . <p> " Good morning , Sister Agatha . I just wanted to say goodbye . I 'll be returning to Italy with my daughter this week , so I wo n't be coming back to Mass at Our Lady of Hope . " <p> Mrs. Lenzi had been a regular for the past year , and she 'd be missed . Sister Agatha was about to say so when a shrill scream pierced the air . Her heart hammering wildly , Sister Agatha looked around quickly for the source . <p> Before she 'd even taken a step , Sister Bernarda shot past her and ran across the parking lot toward the cries . As an exmarine , her soldier 's instincts always gave her the edge in emergencies . <p> Sister Agatha struggled to catch up to her fellow extern . Drawing near , she saw Mrs. Brown , who 'd been the first to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying on the ground beside her . <p> Hearing running footsteps behind her , Sister Agatha turned and saw Sister Jo rushing up . " Go back and call the paramedics . Someone has been injured . " <p> " Right away , Sister Agatha ! " Sister Jo turned around and raced toward the parlor . <p> Uncertain if the parking lot was now a danger zone , Sister Agatha realized that the best place for the worshipers was inside . <p> " Everyone , please return to the chapel now , for your own safety . " She watched as Mrs. Lenzi and the rest stopped , saw that something was wrong , then complied . <p> Sister Bernarda glanced back at Sister Agatha and shook her head imperceptibly . She then focused on eighty-two-year-old Mrs. Brown and led her away , speaking calmly . <p> Sister Agatha took an unsteady breath . Based on Sister Bernarda 's cue , the person sprawled on the graveled parking lot was beyond help . Taking a step closer , Sister Agatha realized that the body belonged to Jane Sanchez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shock numbed her senses , and for a moment she stood frozen to the spot . Their monastery was dedicated to the Lord , and a sin of this magnitude was an affront to everything they stood for  --  charity and love , based on a deep reverence for all of God 's commandments . Reaching out to God for courage and the wisdom to accept what she could n't change , she said a prayer for the repose of Jane 's soul . <p> When she opened her eyes again , her gaze fell on the earthly remains of the woman they 'd all known . Sister Agatha forced herself to study the scene with the practiced eye of an investigative reporter . Though that had been a lifetime ago , those skills would remain with her forever . <p> She crouched beside the body and , making sure not to touch anything , blinked back a tear . There was blood  --  Jane had either been shot or stabbed , and her purse lay open on the ground beside her . Scattered about were her keys , an empty-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her prayer book . She had been robbed and killed or vice versa . <p> Sister Agatha took a deep breath , tearing her gaze from the body . She glanced around to avoid having to look at it again . It was then she realized that the doors of at least two of the cars in the parking lot were open . Maybe Jane had caught the robber riffling through the vehicles and confronted him . Robbery had then turned into murder . <p> Sister Agatha suddenly noticed that the driver 's door of the monastery 's old station wagon , the car they jokingly referred to as the Antichrysler , was also open . It had been vandalized with big scratches . <p> Hearing running footsteps coming toward her again , Sister Agatha turned her head . Sister Jo could have been her twin in size and shape , though there was a lot more bounce in the younger nun 's step . Sister Jo , the latest addition to their family , was gifted with a sharp mind and immeasurable amounts of energy . Pax , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now rushed out in front of her . <p> " Pax , wait ! " Sister Jo ordered , grabbing the dog 's collar . <p> Pax dropped his haunches into an immediate sit but slid several inches . Sister Jo wrapped her arms around the dog 's neck , making sure he went no farther . <p> " No need for that , he 'll stay , " Sister Agatha said . " Did you make the call ? " <p> " Yes , but Sister Bernarda said I should call the sheriff as well . She said that Mrs. Sanchez had either been shot or stabbed and was already dead . So I called the sheriff and told him what had happened . He said to keep everyone away from the scene and make sure no one touched anything . He also asked that everyone stay inside the chapel until he and his team get here . " <p> " All right , " Sister Agatha said . " Do as he asked and make sure everyone remains inside . I 'll stay out here , guard the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What if the killer comes back ? " Sister Jo asked , standing on tiptoes , trying to look past Sister Agatha to get a glimpse of the body . <p> " That 's not likely , but Pax will protect me , " Sister Agatha answered , moving to block her view . " Go back and help Sister Bernarda and Sister de Lourdes keep everyone calm . Nobody can be allowed to leave until the sheriff says it 's okay . " <p> Just then Sister Bernarda come down the chapel 's steps and strode briskly toward them . " The paramedics are on their way . As soon as they arrive , please send them inside . They need to check out Mrs. Brown , " she said . " She 's as pale as a ghost , and I think she 's going into shock . " <p> " Poor woman , " Sister Agatha murmured . <p> " I know the sheriff will want to speak to her , but I have a feeling he 's going to have to wait , " Sister Bernarda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " <p> " Did Mrs. Brown mention having seen someone leaving the parking lot in a hurry ? " <p> Sister Bernarda shook her head . " She just rambled on about how nice Jane had been to her . She 'd always make sure that Mrs. Brown had a hot dinner . That was before the Good News Meal Program got started . " <p> " Jane always said that no one in her neighborhood would ever go hungry while her two hands still worked , " Sister Agatha said quietly . <p> " There 's something I need you to pass on to the sheriff , " Sister Bernarda said . " When Mrs. Brown saw Jane on the ground , she hurried right over to help . There 's no telling what she might have touched . " <p> " Of course . Sheriff Green will go easy when he talks to her . He 's a good man , " Sister Agatha said . <p> As Sister Bernarda left with Sister Jo , Sister Agatha confronted the knowledge that Jane had needed to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . She 'd allowed other concerns to overrule the second great commandment  --  to love thy neighbor as thyself . Guilt made her chest tighten . Was Jane 's problem somehow related to her death , or was it just an unfortunate coincidence ? <p> Sister Agatha had no time to ponder the question . Sirens filled the air . <p> The paramedics , despite being called last , pulled up first . After taking a quick look at Jane 's body , the three-person team rushed toward Sister Bernarda , who was standing at the entrance to the chapel . <p> Sheriff Tom Green arrived next , with the crime scene van and another squad car trailing behind . Sheriff Green , a tall former college track star with thinning hair and a slender waist , joined her a moment later . As he adjusted the latex gloves required for his work , she noticed that his pale blue eyes were bloodshot and his face was drawn with fatigue . <p> " Before you say anything , no , I 'm not sick or hungover . We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed right now if I had n't been in the area when the call came through , " he said . " Now tell me everything you saw and heard . Sister Jo said that the victim may have been shot . " <p> Sister Agatha recounted the sequence of events , including the sound of the car door , the pop , and finally how Mrs. Brown had discovered the body . She then pointed out the car break-ins and the way the Antichrysler had been vandalized . <p> " Does n't anyone lock their car doors ? " Sheriff Green muttered . <p> " Maybe at St. Augustine 's in Bernalillo . But out here , we all feel  --  felt  --  safe , " she answered . <p> " You mentioned a pop . That had to have been the gunshot . <p> It makes sense that the killer would use a small caliber  --  less noisy , " he said . <p> " My brother and I used to shoot tin cans with his.22 , so I 've heard gunshots plenty of times . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precisely , a plop  --  not quite like a gunshot , really . It reminded me of a bubble of chewing gum being popped , only a little softer , I guess . I did n't give it much thought at the time . " She took an unsteady breath , then added , in a voice that did n't sound like her own , " I should have gone outside to check when she did n't come into the chapel . " <p> " I hope you 're not blaming yourself . If you 'd come out to look , you would have undoubtedly interrupted the killer while he was going through her purse or through the other vehicles . You might have become his second victim . " <p> " Maybe so , " she answered in a whisper . <p> " It 's possible , from what you said , that the gun had a silencer . Did you hear any other noises outside ? " Tom pressed . <p> " No . " <p> They both looked over as a black car roared up and slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cloud of dust . A redhaired man in an expensive gray suit , turquoise bolo tie , and black Western boots climbed out . He took a step toward them , but Tom intercepted him before he could come closer . <p> " Stay put , Albrecht . Crime scene here , " he said , gesturing to the deputy who was working quickly to put up the yellow tape . <p> " Understood , " the man said , moving back and bringing out a BlackBerry . <p> " What 's Fritz Albrecht doing here ? " Sister Agatha asked Tom softly . " The last I knew , he was working for Channel 7 in Albuquerque . " <p> " He 's on Mayor Garcia 's staff now . His official title is law enforcement liaison , but he 's more of a pain in the neck , or thereabouts . " <p> " Back when I was a journalist , the word was that he was a real lightweight as a reporter . He was more of the press conference type . " <p> " Word has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that our department needs to improve our image , and we 've been told to pay particular attention to community relations . Fritz is supposed to help us out on that . If we look good , Garcia looks good , " Tom said in a taut voice . <p> " And what else , Tom ? " she pressed , reading his tone correctly . <p> " I 've been told to make sure civilians do n't get involved in our criminal cases . When citizens uncover vital evidence , it makes us look incompetent , according to Garcia . " <p> " I guess that means me , but this time the monastery has a vital interest in what 's going on . My old journalism skills can be an asset to you now . I 'm not after credit . Your department can take it all . " <p> " This is a murder investigation , Sister , and you need to stand back and go about your own calling , " he said as the tape was placed between them . <p> " That 's kinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishioners just got killed outside our chapel . " <p> " Yeah , and let 's hope this leads away from the monastery , not toward it . " Seeing Albrecht staring at both of them , he looked back at Sister Agatha . " I better get to it . " <p> He went to look at the black beaded handbag lying on the ground . Less than a foot away was the victim 's wallet . He picked that up , taking a closer look . " No money , but he left a credit card , her driver 's license , and a voter ID card , " he said , just loud enough for Sister Agatha to hear . <p> " She has her watch and rings , too , and a pearl necklace that looks expensive , " Sister Agatha said after making sure Fritz was n't within hearing distance . <p> " That kind of thing is hard to get rid of around here , " he answered . " I 'll check and see if she carried more credit cards and a checkbook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check ? " <p> " Our cellarer would know . I 'll ask her , " she answered , then added , " Where 's her cell phone ? I know she carried one . " <p> Tom looked in the purse and around the area , then stood . " It might be in a pocket , or her car . Thanks for the tip . Anything else you might want to add ? " <p> " Yeah , " she admitted reluctantly , guilt forming a lump at the back of her throat . " Jane called me on Friday . Something she 'd seen was really bothering her , but I was too busy at the time to meet with her . I asked her to come to the parlor the next day , but she never did . " <p> " Interesting . I 'll check it out with her husband and see if he can tell me what that was about , but it may be totally unrelated . " <p> She swallowed hard but did n't comment . " I know Father Mahoney had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . You 'll have to ask him about that yourself . " <p> " I 'll do that . I 'll be interviewing everyone  --  and you again as well  --  before I leave . " Tom motioned to some officers who 'd been hovering near the scene . <p> As two members of the crime scene unit walked up with their cameras and gear , Sister Agatha stepped back . A third deputy , female , started attaching yellow crime scene tape to a vehicle aerial . <p> Sister Agatha said another prayer for the soul of the departed . For now , Father Mahoney would be prevented from administering Last Rites . Access to homicide victims was restricted to police personnel taking part in the investigation . <p> As one of the women deputies , wearing latex gloves , inventoried the contents of Jane Sanchez 's purse , Sister Agatha glanced away . That was when she noticed what looked like the letter Y on the door of the Antichrysler . Sister Agatha moved to her left , realizing that she might have been premature when she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Positioning herself to see the entire door , she read the message , and it brought chills to her blood . <p> Etched in crude block letters at least a foot high was YOU 'RE NEXT , NUN . <p> Excerpted from The Prodigal Nun by AimTe and David Thurlo <p> Copyright 2008 by AimTe and David Thurlo <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
