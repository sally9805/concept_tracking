Few occasions are more sensitive than a visit to the U.S. of a foreign head of state , and few such events during the Bush years have been as closely watched as Chinese leader Jiang Zemin 's visit to the President 's Texas ranch in 2002 . But a Taiwanese spy named Isabelle Cheng had the inside track on Jiang 's trip , according to a recent court filing . Federal prosecutors say vaunted State department Asia hand Donald Keyser sent Cheng long e-mails detailing his " conversations with Chinese president Jiang " in Texas . At some point prosecutors say , the spy became his lover and Keyser was caught lying to hide the affair  --  and hoarding classified documents in his suburban Washington home . Facing kail and with his marriage threatened , Keyser cut a deal , promising to tell all he knew about Taiwan 's intelligence operations . But then the tale of the diplomat , his spook paramour and his wife  --  also a spy  --  got even weirder . <P> In return for Keyser 's cooperation , prosecutors had accepted his denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three lesser felonies , preserving his pension . But in their filing earlier this month to throw out his plea , they allege Keyser repeatedly lied about his contacts with Taiwanese intelligence . Prosecutors want to enter new evidence to support " espionage-related " charges . <P> The new filing could also raise awkward questions for Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) John Negroponte because Keyser 's wife Margaret Lyons is a senior CIA official on loan in a sensitive post helping set up a new open-source unit of DNI . The prosecutors ' filing says Lyons had known for about a year that Keyser had improperly kept classified documents at home . Worse , current and former U.S. government officials tell TIME , an FBI search of the couple 's home found CIA documents that Lyons had there without authorization . In a Feb. 22 letter to the judge in Keyser 's case , Lyons  --  who has n't been charged  --  admitted she and Keyser had failed " to properly secure " her husband 's secret material . Through a spokesman , Negroponte declined to discuss Lyons ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA spokeswoman said the agency " stands by the decision " not to revoke Lyons ' security clearance . <P> Keyser 's attorney Robert Litt says the prosecutors ' filing " contains numerous inaccuracies . " Litt insists Keyser never spied for Taiwan , did n't improperly disclose classified information and fulfilled his end of the plea bargain . The government seems to disagree  --  and appears content to let this spy saga unfold in court
