<p> Battling declining CD sales , falling profits and pervasive piracy , three of the music industry 's five biggest companies are adopting radically different strategies to revive their flagging fortunes . <p> Two of the companies  --  Sony Music Entertainment Inc. and BMG Entertainment  --  have chosen merger as shelter from the industry 's ills , and they face new hurdles to winning approval from regulators . <p> A third  --  Warner Music Group  --  separated from its corporate parent and now attempting life on its own , is cutting jobs , costs and even rock stars with a broad scythe . <p> All three are finding the transition can be rocky . <p> On Monday , the European Commission gave Sony and BMG  --  owned by German media giant Bertelsmann AG  --  60 pages worth of objections to their proposed union . The document focused mainly on what the commission calls the potential for " passive collusion " by the partners , making it less likely the two would compete over prices once they are part of the same company , according to an industry source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint  --  called a " statement of objections "  --  marked the first significant snag in closing the deal . But both companies sought to reassure investors and others that such concerns are common in combinations of this magnitude . They noted that about 70 percent of proposed mergers receiving such objections have gone on to approval . <p> At Warner , meanwhile , executives are struggling not with bringing together but with shedding part of what exists . <p> In March , the company began firing about 20 percent of its employees . Executive salaries were slashed ( then slightly restored ) on order of chief executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. , who led a partnership in buying Warner from entertainment goliath Time Warner Inc. ( then AOL Time Warner Inc. ) in November 2003 for $2.6 billion . Departments and labels were combined . Now it 's come to the music itself . Earlier this month , Warner began cutting money-losing and under-performing artists from its merged Atlantic-Elektra label 's roster , and is preparing to let go as many as half of the label 's 170 acts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an industry-wide depression . Music ( principally CD ) sales have dropped more than 30 percent over the past three years . The industry blames the falloff on illegal Internet file-sharing and bootlegged CDs , though others outside the companies said consumers have been alienated by high CD prices and a rash of uninteresting artists . Sony , for instance , lost $81 million in 2003 after reporting $188 million in operating income for 2001 . <p> Five companies  --  Universal Music Group , EMI Group PLC , BMG , Sony and Warner  --  sell more than 80 percent of the industry 's music . Universal is the largest , capturing about 26 percent of the market so far this year , according to Nielsen SoundScan , which tracks music sales . BMG and Sony are second and fourth , respectively ; a merger would make them No. 1 , with more than 30 percent of the market . Warner sits in third place , with about 15 percent , and EMI trails all , at about 11 percent . <p> In November 2003 , Sony and BMG announced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both companies more efficient , arguing that the industry 's dire condition makes the union necessary . <p> Sony has been low on hits recently , though it has a formidable catalogue of former hitmakers , including Michael Jackson , Bruce Springsteen and Aerosmith . BMG , on the other hand , has hit artists such as Usher , whose recent album debuted at No. 1 , and Dave Matthews , but a thin back catalogue . The merger would combine the strengths of each company , Sony and BMG executives say . <p> But that merger must first be blessed by regulators around the world . Neither Sony nor BMG publicly disclosed the contents of the EC 's objections and company officials will not comment on the record for fear of annoying regulators . Both companies released statements Monday saying they will address the EC 's concerns . The EC said it wants to make a decision by July 14 . In the United States , the deal is being scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission , where the review process is slightly ahead of Europe 's , the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To gain EC approval for the AOL-Time Warner merger , Warner backed out of a 2000 merger attempt with EMI after the European body 's antitrust chief Mario Monti questioned it . A year later , EMI and BMG bailed on a merger attempt rather than comply with antitrust conditions imposed by the EC . <p> The EC 's concerns this time are similar to those raised four years ago , the source said . Antitrust officials worry that allowing two of the Big Five music companies to combine their recorded music operations ( publishing divisions are not included in the proposal as they were in the 2000 bids ) would create an opportunity to dominate the market and drive up CD prices . <p> Another similarity to 2000 : Monti still oversees the EC 's antitrust division . <p> Sony and BMG are arguing that the music business is different now than it was four years ago . They say that the market dominance music companies once enjoyed has largely been sapped , not only by online music , but by the rise of big-box retailers , such as Wal-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set prices . <p> EMI and Apple Inc.  --  whose iTunes music store is the Internet 's largest digital music retailer , with more than 70 percent of the online market  --  both filed objections to the merger with the EC , the source said . <p> Also objecting to the merger is Impala , a Brussels-based trade group of several independent European music labels . <p> " Our concerns are that the merger would make it significantly easier for the major companies to abuse the marketplace , dominate retailers and reduce artists rosters , " said Impala 's secretary general , Helen Smith , in an interview from Brussels . " It would have disastrous consequences across the whole music sector . " <p> One EU concern is that the corporate parents of the two merger partners could stifle competition by using their diverse empires to dominate music distribution and technology . Critics , for instance , point to Sony 's new online music service , Sony Connect , which sells digital songs for 99 cents each . Opponents of the deal were concerned Sony might lock out other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC apparently did not see this as a threat , the source said . <p> Even as they are attempting to merge , Sony and BMG are watching Warner 's cuts to see if they will be enough to turn around the rival . <p> Warner slipped from second to third place in music sales this year , losing nearly 2 percent of its market share , according to SoundScan . The company also is making fewer hit songs . Last year , the company owned 15.4 percent of " current " market share , meaning recently released songs . So far this year , that number has slipped to 13.2 percent , barely above fourth-place Sony in the " current " category . <p> Warner is involved in a bitter suit with arguably its biggest star  --  Madonna  --  over Maverick , the label co-owned by Madonna and Warner . The two sides are arguing about the value of Maverick , which either Warner or Maverick is supposed to buy outright at the end of this year . Warner says that Maverick has been unprofitable for the past five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 " Jagged Little Pill , " which sold more than 14 million albums . <p> Madonna herself , who is signed to Warner Bros. , has had a poor recent run . She sold only about 640,000 copies of her most recent album , 2003 's " American Life , " after stringing together two decades ' worth of platinum albums.
