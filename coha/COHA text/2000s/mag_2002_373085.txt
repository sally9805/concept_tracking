Leading Poland to democracy brought Lech Walesa a Nobel Peace Prize and international acclaim , but he admits to a few regrets . One is that he was so busy throughout the 1980s and ' 90s that he " did not have the time to follow developments in technology closely . " But he is catching up . <P> The first corporate board Walesa , 58 , has agreed to join is that of NuTech Solutions , a closely held company founded three years ago in Charlotte , N.C. , by a pair of Polish immigrants . NuTech creates software that uses artificial intelligence ( AI ) to boost efficiency in its clients ' manufacturing , distribution and customer service . NuTech software allows Ford to find profitable new ways to sell vehicles that are coming off leases . It helps Unilever target inefficiencies in its supply chain . And it is being used to detect check and credit-card fraud at Bank of America  --  whose legendary former CEO , Hugh McColl , also serves on NuTech 's board . <P> Most software firms , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims that its products  --  developed by using AI technologies such as neural networks , fuzzy logic and evolutionary computing  --  can monitor each player continuously in a supply-and-demand equation , consider the millions of ways each player 's decisions impact the business and then suggest the best ways to fine-tune a client 's operations . " All our products have the common characteristic of increasing profits and decreasing costs , " especially in the targeting of prospective customers , says Matthew Michalewicz , 26 , NuTech 's chief executive . <P> One major bank uses NuTech software to examine millions of customers ' deposit and withdrawal habits , complaint records , bounced checks and even the number of telemarketing calls they have received . The software predicts which customers are disgruntled and likely to take their business elsewhere . The bank then calls to say " We 'd like to make things better for you . " <P> That sort of pre-emptive analysis has been missing from the linear software programs still used by most companies , says Amar Gupta , an M.I.T. productivity expert . NuTech and such competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next tech revolution . " This kind of software gives us the ability to analyze a lot of information a lot better , " says Gupta . " Everybody has to be agile , and in order to be agile , you have to be able to pinpoint trends . " <P> AMR Research , a technology research company based in Boston , estimates that 40% of all new manufacturing-related software already incorporates some form of AI . " Everyone is interested in analyzing large bodies of data to determine what is likely to happen , " says McColl , the former Bank of America CEO . " NuTech has figured out how to do that . " McColl joined NuTech 's board in September and has invested in the company . He and Walesa will receive stock options that could prove valuable if the company successfully goes public . Michalewicz says the 126-employee firm has almost 100 customers and is turning a small profit .
