Like a recurring nightmare , Abu Ghraib never quite goes away . The alleged ringleader of the horrors inflicted at the Baghdad prison , whose grin and thumbs-up over the body of a dead Iraqi prisoner became an image of national shame , showed up for his court-martial in Fort Hood , Texas , last week , with a clean shave and a solemn face . A day earlier , President George W. Bush 's choice for Attorney General , Alberto Gonzales , who played a large role in orchestrating , if not actually drafting , a change in the Administration 's rules on torture , was asked to explain himself before the Senators of the Judiciary Committee who are considering his nomination . Three years after 9/11 , the question remains : How did we end up abusing prisoners in Iraq , Afghanistan and the U.S. naval base at Guant ? ? namo Bay , Cuba  --  almost 20 inmate deaths are being investigated  --  and what is our policy now ? <P> No one disputes the fact that the Bush team departed abruptly from convention when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say those decisions amounted to an authorization of torture  --  a charge the Administration has flatly and repeatedly denied , right up through last month , when it abruptly revised its legal basis for interrogation rules for the second time in 28 months . During his confirmation hearing , Gonzales was quick to say he opposed torture in any form . But the question was never whether Gonzales supported torture  --  it was whether he helped narrow its legal definition so much that he licensed the use of any technique that did not cause grave injury or death . <P> Gonzales is certain to be confirmed as John Ashcroft 's replacement , especially because Democrats are wary of opposing a Hispanic when their hold on that constituency was weakened in the last election . But Gonzales ' nomination raises six issues that are still being sorted out by the government or its watchdogs . <P> WHY DID THE OLD POLICY GET A MAKEOVER ? <P> Many believe it did n't need one . ? ? Until 9/11 , the U.S. military had officially followed the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But after 9/11 , the Bush Administration believed the old rules were naive and unrealistic in the face of a stateless enemy that used airplanes as weapons to kill civilians . Vice President Dick Cheney explained the new approach in an interview just five days after the 9/11 attacks : " We also have to work , though , sort of the dark side . A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly , without any discussion , using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies , if we 're going to be successful . That 's the world we operate in , and so it 's going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal , basically , to achieve our objective . "
