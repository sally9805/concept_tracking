Chapter One " Well , Ms. Daniels , that about wraps it up for now . " Ray Ortega , director of the Strategic Profiling and Identification Network , leveled his stare directly into a pair of sparkling green eyes . " You 've probably figured out from our questions that a position here at SPIN involves more than traditional profiling . We also design false identities for undercover operatives . Do you think you 'd enjoy that sort of thing ? Creating a three-dimensional person with a history , identification and personality , then inserting that person into an existing community without detection ? " " Actually , sir , I think that 's the part of the job I 'd really excel at . " " I like your confidence , " Ray assured her . " And your credentials are impressive . But - " he began gathering up the papers in front of him " - we have several other applicants , so I 'm afraid we wo n't be able to give you our decision until early next week . " " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interview team , motioned for Ray to stay seated at their elongated table across from the interviewee . " I have a question for Miss Daniels . " The young woman smiled . " Yes , Colonel ? " " You 're not only pretty and well educated , you 're an Olympic-grade athlete ! Why this job ? What 's the point of earning a black belt in karate , or becoming a sharpshooter , if you 're hiding away all day working at a computer ? " The candidate gave a slight nod , as though acknowledging the aptness of the question . Then she explained , " I 'll be using my skills as a resource , so that I can create believable identities and workable strategies for government agents . My imagination is my universe , Colonel . It 's all I need . And there 's no place on earth I 'd rather be than at SPIN headquarters , assisting agents in the field . " " It 's a danged waste if you ask me , " the soldier muttered . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong part of my rsum . " The emerald eyes shone with pride . " I graduated summa cum laude from Yale with a double major in psychology and criminology , then went on to get my Ph.D . from Stanford . Professor James Clark , one of the world 's most highly respected profilers , has dubbed me his most gifted student . I 'm published in the field , most recently with an upcoming article for the New England Journal of Psychology . " She turned her attention toward Ray . " Did you have a chance to look at the article I sent you ? " He nodded , remembering the insightful , well-written work . " It was excellent . And as I said , your qualifications are impressive . " " Everything about her is impressive , " insisted Colonel Payton . " Looks like we 're all in agreement . " Ray was on his feet before anyone could protest . " Ms. Daniels , it 's been a pleasure . Here 's my card . If you think of anything else , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hearing from you . " She stood and shook the hand of each interviewer in turn , then headed for the door and disappeared without a backward glance . " Amazing girl , " Payton observed . " Built , too . Is there really any doubt in your mind , Ortega ? Where are you gon na find someone better ? A leggy redhead with a brain and a black belt - if I were twenty years younger , I 'd hire her myself ! " Despite his annoyance at the remark , Ray knew better than to object . After all , Colonel Payton was the president 's best friend and adviser . Was n't that how the guy had gotten himself on the SPIN interview panel in the first place ? It was all politics . But the choice of a new " spinner " was ultimately Ray 's alone , so why sweat it ? He even sent a perfunctory smile in the colonel 's direction . " I agree , sir , she 's an impressive prospect . But something about her bothers me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Let me guess , " interrupted the third interviewer , Ray 's fellow profiler , David Wong . " She 's too sexy ? Too smart ? Speaks too many languages ? " " Okay , okay . " Ray was laughing in spite of himself . " I 'll admit , she 's perfect . Too perfect . That 's what bothers me . If I had set out to design the ideal candidate for this job - " A dull but insistent warning bell sounded in his brain , and he pulled out his cell phone , then punched in his secretary 's number . " Beth ? Did the original transcripts for Melissa Daniels ever arrive from Yale ? " " We got them a few minutes ago , boss . Want me to bring them over ? " Confused , Ray murmured , " No . Thanks anyway , " and ended the call . " What is it , Ray ? " Wong demanded . " Did n't she check out ? I followed up on her references myself , and everyone - including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a wave of his hand . " Do n't worry , she 's legit . " He was about to go further , to admit that they were right , and Daniels was the hands-down best candidate , when a buzz from his cell phone preempted his attention . Murmuring " Give me a second , will you ? " he flipped open the phone and gave his habitual salutation . " This is Ortega . What 's up ? " " Hi , Mr. Ortega . You said to call if I thought of anything else . " " Ms. Daniels ? " Ray arched an eyebrow in the direction of Wong and the colonel . " Sure , go ahead . The others are still here . " " Good , because there 's one tiny matter I 'd really like to bring to your attention . " " There 's more ? " He had to laugh , wondering what further credentials she could possibly have . " Shoot . " " Well , sir ... " The candidate gulped audibly . " Everything on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I made it all up . Every bit of it . " Stunned , Ray tried to think of something to say , finally settling for , " Where are you , Ms. Daniels ? " " Right outside the door . But my name is n't Daniels . It 's Hennessy . Kristie Hennessy . " " Hennessy ? " " And I should probably warn you , I 'm going to look very different the next time you see me . " He shook his head , not trusting himself to respond to that . " Shall I come back in , sir ? " " Yes . Absolutely , " he assured her , turning his full attention to the doorway . " So ? What 's going on ? " Wong demanded . " What new information did she give you ? " " Huh ? " Ray had almost forgotten his colleagues were in the room , so intent was his focus on Daniels - or rather Hennessy - and the door that would readmit her . But facts were facts , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze off the doorway , he announced with a self-mocking smile , " Congratulations , gentlemen . It appears we 've got ourselves a new spinner . " ( Continues ... )
