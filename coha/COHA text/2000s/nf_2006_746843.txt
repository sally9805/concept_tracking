Meeting during the Venus transit of 1761 , Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon spent four year in America , running over 300 miles of boundary lines , often through trackless wilderness . But how exactly were these lines determined ? <p> In 1543 , Copernicus published his Sun-centered model of the Solar System . Using the observations of the planets that had been made over many centuries , he was able to calculate the time it took for each of the five known planets to circle the Sun . He was also able to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun . Kepler would later slightly improve these numbers by putting the planets in elliptical orbits . However , neither Copernicus nor Kepler could determine the absolute size of the planetary radii . <p> Over the next 150 years , many values were published by various authors , but these values differed widely and no consensus could be reached . Then , in 1691 and 1716 , Edmund Halley published two papers showing how a transit of Venus could be used to find the planetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two widely separated locations on Earth . <p> As 1761 approached , both France and England prepared to send several teams to northern and southern locations to observe the Venus transit in June of that year . One of the English teams was to be headed by Charles Mason and assisted by Jeremiah Dixon . Mason , a talented mathematician and astronomer , had been an assistant to the Astronomer Royal , James Bradley , for four years . It is believed that Dixon , a surveyor and keen astronomer , had been recommended by the great instrument maker , John Bird . <p> In December of 1760 , Mason and Dixon left on a Royal Navy warship for Sumatra in the south Pacific . However , due to delays caused by the ongoing Seven Years War , they only reached the Cape of Good Hope by April . They decided to observe from Capetown and not risk running out of time . They carefully measured the latitude and longitude of the Cape , as these values were essential for the transit calculations . Luckily , the sixth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to observe the transit . <p> They returned to England in 1762 , little suspecting that within a year they would begin another equally exciting adventure . Coming to America <p> The Catholic Calverts were granted in 1632 a charter for land north of the Potomac , up to the 40th parallel ( i.e. , Maryland ) . And in 1680 , William Penn was granted land from the 40th to the 43rd parallel ( i.e. , Pennsylvania ) . Penn desperately wanted a seaport city on the Delaware River , so he sited Philadelphia on land that was later found to be four miles south of the 40th parallel . The wording of the grants contained some ambiguous statements , and Penn 's court connections were good enough that he was able to keep Philadelphia at that site  --  actually expanding Pennsylvania 's land holdings substantially . <p> Of course , the Calverts contested this . Finally , in the 1760s , after eighty years of disputing the boundary , both parties agreed to join in a new survey of the boundary . American surveyors had run a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became clear that running the entire line was technically beyond their abilities and instruments . Inquiries were made in London about suitable candidates , and the names of Mason and Dixon soon came to the fore . A contract was signed , and on November 15 , 1763 Mason and Dixon landed at Philadelphia . Finding the Latitude <p> The initial step for Mason and Dixon was to locate the parallel that was to be the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania . It was to be fifteen miles south of the southern edge of the original city of Philadelphia . By April 12th of 1764 , the two surveyors had measured south to the correct latitude and were at a location they called PMW , " Post Marked West . " <p> But first they had to measure the latitude . The most common device at that time for finding latitude was the seaman 's sextant . With it , the peak height of a star or the Sun above the horizon was measured . Since this was usually done on a pitching ship , large rigidly mounted sextants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user could adjust for the ship 's motion  --  but this limited the accuracy to a mile or more . <p> Instead of the sextant , Mason and Dixon had with them a latitude-measuring instrument called a zenith sector , made especially for the survey by John Bird . Because one can not see a true horizon in the woods , the sector looked at the zenith ; it was essentially a telescope mounted vertically and adjusted with an internal plumb bob . The telescope swung along a north-south line , and an accurate scale measured how far the observed star passed north or south of the zenith . The scale itself only went ten degrees on either side of zenith . Consider as an example a star with a declination of thirty-seven degrees : if the star passed directly overhead , the observer was on the thirty-seventh parallel . If it passed two degrees south of the zenith , then the observer was at thirty-nine degrees north latitude . <p> The zenith sector was developed to read to an accuracy of 0.1 arcsecond , which was equal to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom reached their rated level of accuracy , and the sector was no exception . It would have been impossible for the six-foot sector ( set up on varying terrains , protected by a simple wood and canvas tent , and carried for miles over mountainous wilderness ) to duplicate the level of accuracy of the finest instruments in the world ( three to four times bigger than the sector , mounted on stone walls and protected by stone buildings ) that were also giving results to 0.1 arcsecond . John Bird had predicted it would be accurate to about 200 feet , and this was very close to the sector 's actual performance . Mason and Dixon dared not run a line for hundreds of miles without checking the latitude to make sure a tiny error had not caused a drift that left them miles from the true latitude . <p> They were working at an accuracy level that required corrections for Earth 's precession and nutation , atmospheric refraction , and stellar aberration , and these corrections were made for all their star observations . Over a month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector . After making half of the observations , they rotated the telescope 180 degrees and repeated the observations . The sector values differed by about four seconds , amounting to 400 feet , after rotating the telescope . Doing this averaged out any imperfections in the telescope optics , a method still used as a standard for surveyors today . <p> Mason and Dixon used the same five stars each time they stopped to measure latitude  --  Vega , Deneb ( alpha Cygni ) , delta and gamma Cygni , and Capella . Because the total duration of the survey lasted about four years , there were times they were running the line during the warm months , and during these months they had to make their observations in daylight . This can be done if you know exactly where to point the telescope . Only once did Mason comment on having a problem with the observations when he wrote on 17 June 1766 : " Capella passing the meridian with the sun , and the weather in general a little hazy in the daytime prevented our making any observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitude of the Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary was 39 degrees 43 minutes and 18.2 seconds . Modern GPS values differ by 240 feet , very close to Bird 's 200-foot estimate of sector accuracy . Next , the Maryland-Delaware Line <p> Mason and Dixon next journeyed about 100 miles south to the marker placed by the American surveyors at the southwest corner of what is now Delaware . The line they were about to run was the one that had defeated the American surveyors : it was not a due-north line but a line slightly west of north that would run tangent to a twelve-mile circle centered in New Castle , Delaware . <p> From the marks left by the American surveyors , Mason and Dixon concluded that a line running about 3.5 degrees west of north would give the best tangent line . To run this line , they used a piece of equipment , also made especially for the survey by John Bird , called a transit  --  a surveyor 's instrument for measuring horizontal and vertical angles . They sighted the transit on the mark and then swung the telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They found that delta Ursa Minor , in its daily circle around the North Star , touched the crosshairs when it was at its westernmost position . As they ran the line north , they would check their direction by observing this star . In a few months , they reached the tangent point and found they were 495 yards too far west . They were confident they had run a straight line so they shifted their line east to complete this " tangent line " ( modern measurements show a slight bow in the line with a maximum distance of only fifteen feet in the eighty-mile line ) . The line was now extended due north from the tangent point until they were sure the due-west line would cross it . <p> Lastly , the Pennsylvania-Maryland Line After completing the running of the Maryland-Delaware line , Mason and Dixon headed east , returning to PMW ( Post Marked West ) , the site that marked the latitude of the Pennsylvania-Maryland boundary . <p> They were now ready to run the line west . The parallel of latitude is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyors are used to running straight lines . Mason and Dixon 's straight tangent line produced instead an arc of a great circle . However , because the parallel itself is not a great circle , any straight line due west will continue to trace out the great circle while the parallel curves away from it . <p> To compensate for this , Mason could have run a series of short cords and offsets to the parallel , but he did not trust any large-angle measurements . Instrument makers could accurately make small scales , like on the sector , but large angular scales always had errors . Mason instead decided not to run a straight line due west , but a fraction of a degree north of west ; the true parallel would drift south before curving back to cross the straight line being run . His calculations showed that if he started out moving at 89 degrees 55 minutes and 51 seconds to the west of north , the parallel would drift south to a maximum distance of about twenty feet before curving back to cross his line after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large angle if one does n't trust large angular scales ? <p> Once again Mason turned to the heavens and this time aligned the pair 's transit along a north-south line . When a chosen star crossed the meridian , the time was noted . Mason calculated how long it would now take the star to swing around to the 89 degree 55 minute 51 second angle . As it neared that calculated time , the star was tracked with the transit . At the instant the star reached the required angle , the horizontal axis was locked and the transit swung to ground level . A candle at a distance of about half a mile was aligned in the crosshairs , and in the morning , this is the line they followed . <p> After running for 12.31 miles , Mason and Dixon stopped and spent thirteen days finding their latitude with the zenith sector . They were 129 feet north of the parallel . Temporary wooden posts had been placed every mile . On one of their return trips they shifted each post the necessary distance to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipment from England , they placed permanent stone posts every mile . The stones were one-foot square and four- to seven-feet long and weighed anywhere from 400 to 700 pounds . Most posts had a Pennsylvania " P " on the north side and a Maryland " M " on the south side . At each five-mile mark , " crownstones " were used  --  these stones carried the crests of the Penns and the Calverts instead of letters . <p> Mason and Dixon continued running the line for the remainder of 1765 and until June 1766 when they reached 165 miles from their starting point . They were now at the Alleghenies , and the King had forbidden settlements west of these mountains . The team returned east , waiting until the Iroquois tribes gave permission to proceed farther . A team of axmen had been cutting a path about twenty-five feet wide for the surveyors , and from the Alleghenies ' peaks Mason could see the curvature of this vista as it followed the parallel of latitude . In his journal he wrote that it " formed the arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sphere . " <p> In June 1767 , word was finally received that the Iroquois had not only agreed , but were sending an escort of about twenty members of the tribe to ensure that the party was not attacked by the Shawnee or Delaware . On the 13th of July , the team began the next segment of the line . Steep mountains and narrow valleys made the trek extremely difficult and slowed the team 's progress substantially . They seldom could get the heavy stone markers into position and had to instead use cairns , or piles of rocks , as markers . <p> On September 19 , Mason and Dixon reached the Monongahela River at 222 miles west of their initial starting point , and on October 9 , 1767 , they crossed a warpath near Dunkard Creek . The creek was named for a nearby village of people who belonged to the Dunkard religion and who had been massacred there in 1755 . The Iroquois escorts told them the warpath marked the extent of Iroquois lands , and they would go no farther . About half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , and , like the Iroquois escorts , the remaining axmen refused to go on . <p> But Mason and Dixon had reached 233 miles . The zenith sector was used to find the final latitude and the party turned east to begin the long hike back to Post Marked West . The return trip had a bittersweet quality . The two fellows were justly proud of their 233-mile line , but they had been stopped only about twenty miles short of the western boundary of Pennsylvania . Modern Results <p> A surveyor named Todd Babcock organized fellow surveyors in the 1990s to use new GPS technology and measure the precise location of the first 130 stones to centimeter accuracy . The results were shocking : the Mason and Dixon line actually meanders ! At times it is as much as 800 feet from the desired latitude line ! <p> Did Mason and Dixon really do such a poor job ? <p> Actually , no . In the 1760s a number of scientists argued that a plumb bob would be pulled slightly off the vertical if mountains were found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no experimental evidence and the theory could not accurately calculate the exact magnitude of the interference , no corrections could be made to plumb bobs . <p> Masons journal is so detailed that the initial line they ran before making corrections can be recreated . It shows that the zenith sector gave readings as much as 900 feet from where the sector was actually placed . Since the scatter in the star readings seldom exceeds a few hundred feet , it appears that some systematic error was also present . The United States Geological Survey has now mapped the country for variations in the pull of gravity from the vertical . By correcting the sector 's results for gravity variations at each site , the sector errors go from as high as 900 feet to a reasonable maximum of just 200 feet . John Bird knew his instrument , and Mason and Dixon actually did a superb job , consistent with the quality of their instruments and the science of their day . Final Years <p> Mason and Dixon arrived back in England in time to participate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the team was split  --  Mason headed a group that went to Ireland , while Dixon took one to Norway . <p> On their return from the transit expeditions , the two former colleagues settled back into their lives . Jeremiah Dixon concluded his Norway trip on Hammerfest Island and went back to his home in County Durham ; there he spent the rest of his life as a country gentleman and occasional surveyor . He died in 1779 at the age of 46 years . <p> Charles Mason returned to his job at the Royal Greenwich Observatory . The new Astronomer Royal , Nevil Maskelyne , had become interested in the question of the effect of local gravity on a plumb bob , and Mason , no stranger to exploration , was sent to Scotland to find a suitable mountain where they could run an experiment . He chose a mountain in the Scottish Highlands named Schiehallian but declined the invitation to lead the experiment  --  probably due to the low pay and his poor health . <p> Over the next ten years , Mason crafted information to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local determinations of latitude and lunar tables for finding longitude . For this latter work , he applied to the Longitude Board for some of the prize money but received far less than he expected ( and , unlike Dixon , he was never elected to the Royal Society ) . <p> These coupled facts might explain what he did next . In 1786 Benjamin Franklin received a letter from Mason stating that Mason and his wife and eight children had arrived in Philadelphia . Mason said he was not feeling well but would contact Franklin when he recovered . A month later Franklin 's newspaper , the Pennsylvania Gazette , carried an article stating that Charles Mason , age 53 , died on October 25 . He was buried in an unmarked grave at Christ Church , the same cemetery as Ben Franklin . <p> Sadly , their deaths reunited the team of Mason and Dixon . This time , though , they were together to roam among the stars that they both so loved and used so effectively during their time on Earth . <p> MAP : The line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MAP : The survey lines set by Mason and Dixon in their work in what is now Delaware , Pennsylvania , Maryland , and West Virginia .

He can be reached by email at robmentzer@comcast.net . <p> The Length of Latitude <p> A scientific topic of great interest in the 1700s was the exact shape of our planet . Newton had used his laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bulge slightly at its equator . If this were true , a degree of latitude would be longer near the equator than a degree near the poles . Latitude measurements had been made but some of the results showed the opposite effect , and no consensus existed . <p> Mason and Dixon noticed how flat the land was during their eighty-mile running of the tangent line . Even the miles they had measured down from Philadelphia  --  from the piedmont to the coastal plain  --  had only a gentle roll . They wrote a letter to the Royal Society asking for funding so they could remain in America following the conclusion of their work to establish Pennsylvania 's southern border and do the first accurate measurement of a length of latitude degree in the western hemisphere . They received permission to do so and carefully calibrated wooden measuring rods using a brass standard ; both the rods and the standard were sent from England . In October 1766 they went back to the southern end of the tangent line , at the southwest corner of Delaware , and carefully measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they returned to the north end of the fifteen-mile measurement from Philadelphia and rechecked the latitude . <p> The pair determined their longitude by observing three eclipses of Jupiter 's Galilean moons  --  the preferred method of the period for finding longitude on land . The time of an eclipse was measured in local time and compared to tables showing the Paris local time for the event . Mason and Dixon found their longitude , which placed them about 5200 miles west of Paris . <p> After this longitude determination , they began the careful measurement of the 102-mile line in late February 1768 using their calibrated measuring rods . By early June they had completed the measurements . Their results helped confirm Newton 's idea that as one nears Earth 's equator , a degree of latitude subtends greater distance because of the planets equatorial bulge . <p> The two English surveyors spent a few months on the final details of their work , and then Mason wrote this final entry in his journal : " September 11 At 11:30 A.M. went on Board the Halifax Packet Boat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Mason . "  --  R. M. <p> <p> Defining North and South Using Mason and Dixon 's Line <p> The " Mason and Dixon line " is the only state boundary named for the surveyors . The expression first appeared eight years after the line was run in correspondence between the leaders of the new states of Virginia and Pennsylvania regarding how to finish the border between them . In August 1776 , Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter : " As an advocate I shall certainly insist on it ; but I wish they would compromise by an extension of Mason &; Dixon 's line . " In the next nine years , three other surviving letters used that term in the boundary negotiations . Then , in 1784 , in a letter describing what we would call a tornado , the author wrote : " The storm then took across the ridge , and made as clear a line as ever Mason and Dixon did . " <p> None of the first appropriations of the expression  --  in letters involving matters of states ' boundaries and merely popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as time of the Civil War approaches , use of the " Mason and Dixon line " increases and comes to conjure a division between North and South . <p> An 1858 article by noted botanist William Darlington , appearing three years before the beginning of the Civil War , explains how the term became linked to slavery . In Historical Magazine , Darlington wrote : " The phrase ' Mason and Dixon 's Line ' has been echoing in our ears ever since 1820  --  when during the excited debate in Congress on the question of excluding Slavery from Missouri , that eccentric genius John Randolph of Roanoke was continually harping on the words : and those words were as constantly reiterated through every newspaper in the land . " <p> The text of Randolph 's speeches from 1820 has been lost , but two of his 1824 speeches against a harsh tariff bill survive . He states in one : " . and then we , who belong to that unfortunate portion of this Confederacy which is south of Mason and Dixon 's line . " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the country south of Mason and Dixon 's line . " It appears that Randolph came across the term and decided to use it as a rhetorical device in his speeches . What followed from that was adoption of the expression by others  --  then and since  --  to express a division , real or imagined , between the North and South in the eastern United States .  --  R.
