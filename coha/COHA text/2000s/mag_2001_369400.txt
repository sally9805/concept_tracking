California Governor Gray Davis was in his Sacramento office with four legislative leaders on Jan. 11 when the state went into a Stage 3 power emergency . Blackouts were imminent . <P> So Davis became a power broker . Literally . He got on the phone and had some juice shifted to the needy north from South California Edison ; then he wheedled 133 megawatts from an out-of-state generator , as if he were borrowing a cup of sugar from a neighbor . The lights did n't go out that day , but from that moment it became clear that Davis ' political future would be calibrated in megawatts  --  or the lack thereof . <P> In the two years since he was elected , Davis has triangulated obsessively , shunning confrontation and partisan dogfighting in his search for the middle ground on such issues as education , public safety and HMO reform . Because he has a reputed campaign chest of some $21 million , there is already talk of a presidential bid in 2004 . He likes to be compared with British Prime Minister Tony Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Make progress where there is already common ground  --  that is what I believe in , " Davis told TIME in an interview last week in Sacramento . But with utilities going broke , out-of-state generators piling up huge profits and consumer groups resisting any increase in their electricity bills , the middle ground opened up under him like a fault line . " That approach may not work in this particular situation , " he acknowledged . <P> His more deliberate actions may not work either . As the first blackouts rolled across Northern California , Davis declared a state of emergency and pushed the legislature to appropriate state funds to pay for electricity that its utilities could no longer afford . Politicians from both parties warned that Davis ' plan might simply squander the state 's financial reserves without increasing the long-term supply of power . But , says David Morse , an independent consumer advocate attached to the Public Utilities Commission , " there are n't a lot of pleasant choices to make . " <P> Critics say the Governor 's innate sense of caution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months ago and at $10 billion less for the utility companies , " says Representative Keith Richman , Republican minority whip in the state assembly . Richman points out that following a spike in power rates in San Diego last August , Republicans wrote a letter to Davis calling for a special session of the legislature " to solve California 's energy crisis . " The Governor did not respond . " The reason we are at this crisis today is because of the Governor 's lack of action and lack of leadership , " says Richman.
