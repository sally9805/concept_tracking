Laurel Hill Offers Biodiversity in the Shadow of the NewJersey Turnpike // With more than 600,000 drivers each day , the northern half of the New Jersey Turnpike is among the most widely traveled roads in America . For the most part , its not a pretty sight . The industrial wastelands , abandoned factories and former landfills that pass for scenery are arguably the biggest reason for New Jersey 's lessthan-stellar reputation across the nation . Amazingly , there 's a spot next to the Turnpike , less than 10 miles from New York City , which is living , breathing proof that , given time , nature can rebound from just about anything , if we allow it to . Laurel Hill serves as an astounding example of nature overcoming decades of rampant pollution to reclaim an unlikely area . This jagged rocky outcropping , which the Turnpike 's eastern spur uses as a stepping stone over the marshes known as the Meadowlands , is the only natural break from the flat lowlands for miles . From the highway , its graffiti-covered walls and treetopped plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't exactly shout out , " Nature . " Yet from below the Turnpike , Laurel Hill is a completely different place , looming above like the Rock of Gibraltar . In fact , in 1896 , a New York City ad executive thought the same thing . He was inspired enough by this landmark rising above the swamps that he believed his insurance company could demonstrate its reliability and rock-solid foundation through a connection to " the rock . Thus was the famous Prudential Insurance logo born in the much-maligned swamps of the Meadowlands . The approach to Laurel Hill winds past abandoned buildings and factories , which soon give way to kids playing soccer and an older couple walking their retriever on a ballpark carved out of the marshes . A huge , stunningly beautiful red-tailed hawk , with a wingspan of four feet , alternately glides and calmly flaps its wings above the road for a good 15 seconds before taking a sharp right turn over the Hackensack River marsh . More kids climb on a riverside playground , and in the water beyond is a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water like a seaplane . At Laurel Hill , you can spot waders such as herons , egrets , bitterns and glossy ibis , and predators such as ospreys , hawks , falcons and owls , with even the occasional bald eagle . Photograph Laurel Hill is an important habitat for pheasants , falcons , muskrats , herons , egrets and even the occasional bald eagle . // According to Bill Sheehan , the Hackensack Riverkeeper , " In the high grounds of Laurel Hill , you can still hear gamecock and pheasants . These birds were n't brought in here for hunting . They 're real natives , born and bred in the Meadowlands . " Phragmites , the tall marsh reeds with feathery-plumed tips , are omnipresent , prospering in the oft-polluted places where most plants ca n't survive . It was n't always like this . Only 200 years ago , half of the Meadowlands was covered by a white cedar forest , much of which was burned down because it provided cover for bandits and pirates . The remaining forest died out when the Hackensack River was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While nature has been able to bounce back repeatedly from man 's carelessness , " The Rock " of Laurel Hill was nearly eradicated permanently . Before 1960 , it had already survived decades of serving as a prison , mental asylum , poorhouse , hospital and graffiti canvas . In the early 1960s , however , Hudson County leased Laurel Hill to a traprock quarry , which proceeded to demolish three-quarters of it within five years , lowering its height by 50 feet in the process . The remainder would have soon followed if not for the vibrating of the Turnpike when the blasting got too close . It was certainly a new role for the New Jersey Turnpike : guardian of nature . A path carved from the boulders leads to the top of Laurel Hill . Amazingly enough , this is ancient volcanic rock , pushed up an estimated 180 million years ago . This five-minute hike brings a view that was shared by Continental Army soldiers who used it as a lookout point during the Revolutionary War .

The 360-degree view reveals 32 square miles of wide-open flatlands bordered in the distance on all sides by the densely populated areas of northern New Jersey and New York City . Photograph Hackensack Riverkeeper Bill Sheehan has organized eco-cruises so people can visit Laurel Hill , a natural oasis 10 miles from New York City . // After the near-destruction of Laurel Hill , it stood fallow with hardly any human intrusion through the 1970s and 1980s . As the economy rebounded in the 1990s , there was far more pressure to develop the land . " At that point , we basically threw a park in front of the bulldozers , " says Sheehan . In 1997 , Laurel Hill County Park was born . Canoeing and pontoon tours are now offered by the Hackensack Riverkeeper for close-up views of the thriving wildlife , twisting channels and the occasional floating tire , reminders of a bleak past giving way to a hopeful future . Last summer , more than 1,000 people took part in these eco-cruises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , which has thus far shown a somewhat surprising interest in rediscovering a piece of nature which had been given up for dead years ago . Lately , jetskis and even swimmers are appearing in the Meadowlands , as dumping has been outlawed and the cleaning process accelerated . " At this point in time , swimming is not advisable , " says Sheehan . " But a big part of my mission as Hackensack Riverkeeper is to make sure these waters become swimmable again . " For some , it 's swimmable now . A muskrat paddles across the rain-filled roadside gully and then ambles across the road . It resembles a small beaver except for its narrow tail . Like beavers , muskrats build lodges out of sticks , twigs , cattails and bulrushes , reinforcing them with mud . These lodges have underwater entrances , and the hardy muskrat can hold its breath for up to 15 minutes . The muskrat is a highly adaptable creature , and its plight in the Meadowlands has actually improved over the years , since the generations of former muskrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the only sizable animals that have carved out a niche in this altered , seminatural environment . The northern diamondback terrapin , red fox , snapping turtle , raccoon , rabbit , skunk , opossum and blue crab , all animals that do well living close to people , have adapted nicely to the rapid changes of the Meadowlands . Thirty years ago , there were virtually no fish and no recreational fishing , according to Sheehan . There were 100 species of birds in the Meadowlands , but few of them built their nests there . Now , thanks to the Clean Water Act and the work of people like Sheehan , the Meadowlands hosts 265 species of birds , 63 of which nest there , and of those , 12 or 13 are threatened or endangered in New Jersey as a whole . Sheehan does not exaggerate when he says , " The Meadowlands had bottomed out ecologically , but now the estuary is alive with an amazing amount of biodiversity . " <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
