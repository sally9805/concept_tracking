If Academy members were limited to Hollywood fare when filling out their ballots for the Best Picture of 2000 , they might enter NONE OF THE ABOVE . It was that kind of year for mainstream films . Oh , some made money ( Mission this , Perfect that ) , but few were as persuasive as their marketing campaigns . Comedy was often black guys in fat-woman drag , and you could n't find an action film with a brain unless it starred Russell Crowe . So we looked elsewhere for our 10 Best . Honestly , we like a good Hollywood movie , and when we find one , we 'll tell you . But there are wonderful films made all over : in Asia , Europe and independent America . Next time , check out a film like the ones here . The most satisfying movie adventure can be in choosing a film you never knew you 'd love . <P> 1 CROUCHING TIGER , HIDDEN DRAGON In Ang Lee 's martial-arts enthraller , two mature warriors ( Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhang Ziyi ) . A lovely melancholy anchors the buoyant fight scenes that exceed expectations even as they defy gravity . The result  --  magic , not trickery  --  should leave the viewer gasping  --  for breath and in awe . <P> 2 YOU CAN COUNT ON ME A roughneck wanderer ( Mark Ruffalo ) drops in on his staid , small-town sister ( Laura Linney ) and incidentally makes a man of her overprotected son . Writer-director Kenneth Lonergan 's film is a rueful , truthful study of heartland heartache . <P> 3 GEORGE WASHINGTON Poor kids in rural North Carolina face a drab life and sudden death with varying degrees of grownup perplexity , anger and idealism . From these convulsions of preadolescent yearning , auteur David Gordon Green , 25 , weaves a rich , rapturous tapestry of images and emotions . <P> 4 SUNSHINE Three generations of a Hungarian-Jewish family endure 20th century tyrannies : imperialism , Nazism , Stalinism . Ralph Fiennes plays all three central victims in director Istvan Szabo 's vast yet intimate tale of failed compromises , grim diminishments , brutal loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers " is how co-director Nick Park described this nifty comedy-adventure about a heroine hen spurring her balky brood to freedom . A triumph of stop-motion animation and a hymn to plucky sisterhood . <P> 6 BEST IN SHOW Patient doggies and their frenzied owners compete for a top kennel-club prize in this wicked but unpatronizing comedy . Improvised by a maniacally alert cast under the supervision of director Christopher Guest , it is the year 's most original and delirious laff riot . <P> 7 THE COLOR OF PARADISE A blind boy with a consuming love of nature struggles to love a father who is blind to his son 's gift for wonder . Majid Majidi 's Iranian drama has enough incident for an action movie and the soul of a child who is himself a glorious force of nature . <P> 8 NURSE BETTY Addled by her husband 's vicious murder , a waitress ( Renee Zellweger ) hits the road for L.A. to embrace a more pleasing life inside her favorite soap opera . Director Neil LaBute 's film is a hilarious , oddly touching meditation on fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIFE Is n't the phrase " intelligent thriller " an oxymoron ? Not this season : a political-ransom action movie can also be a complex romantic triangle , with Russell Crowe , Meg Ryan and David Morse all excellent . It 's Casablanca with firepower .
