<p> Early last year , LaToya " Tiny " Ray threw a few possessions into a U-Haul truck and rode off with her son into the Colorado witness protection program . <p> She had agreed to testify against her husband , Robert Ray , in a potential death-penalty case in which he was charged with killing another witness and his fiance . <p> In return for that testimony , Colorado 's witness protection program left LaToya Ray and her 8-year-old son without a job or a home . For eight months , she crashed in the living room of another protected witness in the same case . <p> " I did n't have a telephone . My son did n't have a bed , " she said in a recent interview . " I did n't have dishes . Did n't have a TV . " <p> With few exceptions , Colorado 's witness protection program offers little more than moving expenses to people risking their lives to testify . <p> Arapahoe County prosecutors have launched the most ambitious witness protection effort in Colorado history to prevent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killing of Gregory Vann at an Aurora park on July 4 , 2004 . <p> Yet Arapahoe County 's effort left its star witness ' son without a bed . It spent more than $37,000 to protect two other witnesses while LaToya and her son ate off a neighbor 's plates . <p> LaToya 's lawyer , Sean McDermott , has been frustrated by the disparities in payments made to his client compared with other witnesses , and the battles he has had to fight with prosecutors over living expenses . <p> " There should be some structure to this thing . There should be some sort of rhyme or reason , " he said . " The big difficulty for me - help her plan her life a little bit . What can she realistically expect ? For them to be upset about the modest requests we 've made , I 'm beside myself with that . " <p> E-mail exchanges between McDermott and the district attorney 's office spell out the many arguments over those requests . <p> It began with items she kept in storage until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district attorney 's office questioned why it had to keep paying $119.90 a month for items that were supposed to be removed by June 30 . <p> That went through , but prosecutor John Hower accompanied it with a warning , " I will authorize this payment with the LOUD AND CLEAR statement to Tiny that this is the end . No More . Finito . No mas . " <p> When she found a low-income apartment in another state last year for $375 a month , the district attorney 's office agreed to pay one month 's rent , a security deposit and the electric deposit . She also qualified for a small welfare assistance payment in her new state . <p> In September , McDermott noted that LaToya had spent little for housing and asked if she could obtain " living items such as a microwave oven , utensils such as pots , pans , plates and an inexpensive television . " <p> Hower 's reply : " You got ta be kidding , right ? We are going to explain to the state and to the taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven , etc ? I do n't think so . I urged and recommended that we assist with the apartment and other necessities . There are limits on what we can and will do , and you and she have reached them . " <p> In October , McDermott told the district attorney that LaToya 's gas deposit was not paid , and " as a result her gas was cut off on Friday . She is currently without heat and is cold . " <p> Assistant District Attorney Leslie Hansen objected , saying LaToya had agreed to pay the deposit . " Moreover , utility companies do not just cut people off , they give notice after notice so LaToya must have known there was a problem so why did she wait until they actually cut it off ? " she wrote . " I 'm sorry , but our funds are not unlimited . We made an agreement with LaToya and she must meet her obligations . " <p> McDermott replied that LaToya " has not mismanaged the limited amount of money that has been provided her . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provided . " <p> The district attorney 's office would not discuss how many witnesses have been protected in this case or what it has spent on each of them . But according to a document obtained by The Denver Post , it spent a total of $64,519 to protect nine witnesses from June 2005 through May 2006 . <p> One witness ' family was given $19,428 for housing , moving , utilities and other expenses , and another received $18,009 . Teresa Riley , another witness in the case who eventually let LaToya stay with her temporarily , had been paid $8,329 . <p> LaToya Ray had received $1,443 to start a new life with her son in another state . Prosecutors wo n't discuss the disparities among the amounts their witnesses received . <p> In January 2007 , LaToya wrote a letter to the district attorney 's office pleading for help . " I have no phone , I have no dishes , I have 1 pot , 1 skillet , 1 pan , 6 forks , 5 spoons , 4 knifes . My son needs a blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really going through it now , I 'm 5 mo . pregnant and am high risk , " she wrote . <p> In February , the district attorney 's office asked LaToya to specify what she needed . " Apparently she is frustrated and feeling desperate , " Hower noted . <p> She sent her lawyer a list : <p> 1 . Television set . $109.99 at Wal-Mart . <p> 2 . Home phone . deposit $45.99 . <p> 3 . Dish set $49.99 at Wal-Mart . <p> 4 . Pot and pan set $59.99 at Wal-Mart . <p> 5 . Blow-up mattress for Tyreese $40 at Wal-Mart and the pump , $19.99 . <p> 6 . Silverware set $19.99 at Family Dollar . <p> " These are things that I really need and everything came to a total of $345.94 , " she wrote . <p> The district attorney 's office relented . <p> But LaToya 's lawyer and the district attorney are still fighting over the unpaid rent and cleaning costs from the Aurora apartment she was urged to leave . <p> If LaToya " were in the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote . " She would have been provided the funds that I am requesting . " <p> In an interview , the district attorney in Arapahoe County , Carol Chambers , said her office can not discuss the case because a gag order has been imposed . <p> But in general , she said , payments to witnesses " must be related to our case and the time the person became a witness in our case . " <p> She also suggested that the state Division of Criminal Justice , not district attorneys , should screen candidates for witness protection . District attorneys decide how much witnesses get , then apply for reimbursement through a state board . <p> " It would take away any inferences that we are providing financial incentives for testimony , " she said . <p> Husband a defendant <p> On July 4 , 2004 , Vann was killed and two others were shot at an outdoor party in Aurora . Javad Marshall-Fields survived and became a witness , but he and his fiance , Vivian Wolfe , were killed before he could testify . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the July 4 shootings , and authorities have charged him and two others with murdering Marshall-Fields and Wolfe . <p> LaToya told a grand jury that her husband and a friend discussed eliminating Marshall-Fields as a witness , calling him a " snitch . " <p> She also testified that her husband 's friend explained to her that Wolfe was killed because " the b  --  was in the wrong place at the wrong time . " <p> After Marshall-Fields was killed , Chambers promised to protect the remaining witnesses , including LaToya . Her office hastily drew up contracts , which one source described as a one-page agreement , with witnesses who left Colorado . <p> But when her office applied for reimbursement , the state board rejected about $10,000 and set new standards for the maximum hotel or meal expense it would cover . <p> Meanwhile , the witness expenses in this case cleaned out the state witness protection fund . Colorado 's Department of Public Safety applied and received $38,000 in emergency funds from the legislature just to cover witness protection costs for the balance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took in LaToya and her son , that put her own housing at risk . Together , their families exceeded the maximum number of residents in a federally subsidized apartment . <p> " I was n't going to leave her and her baby in the street , " Riley said . <p> After LaToya found her own apartment , Riley dropped out of witness protection and returned to Colorado . <p> She found a night job at a warehouse , but " I 'm still homeless , " she said . " I 've been at my boyfriend 's house and my daughter 's house , staying wherever I can . " <p> Riley witnessed Robert Ray 's behavior after the July 4 shootings . She said she left the protection program after 16 months because she was struggling to survive and her teenage sons hated where they lived . <p> " I do n't know why they call it a witness protection program . They do n't follow through , " said Riley , who says she will still testify at Ray 's trial and take her chances that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Do n't make no friends , do n't talk to anyone , but find a job .

She spent the last weeks of her pregnancy worrying about buying a car seat and a bassinet . <p> " With my family 's help , it would have been better , " she said . " I lost everyone . There 's just no contact with anyone . " <p> She has a two-bedroom apartment with walls bare but for photos of her children and one of her husband . Once , when food ran short , she tried to donate blood plasma for money . <p> " My first year and a half here , we just went through hell . I cried so hard , " she said . <p> Now she has a job at a day-care center , which she hopes will enable her to rent a bed for her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Her baby daughter " do n't got no bed - she just sleeps in the bed with me , " she said . <p> She said she hears from prosecutors only when she is needed in court , and otherwise they would n't know if she died . <p> " Nobody calls to check on me , " she said . " I do n't even feel like I 'm in a program . I 'm just a single mom , struggling with my kids .
