Current legislative mandates for schools to bring all students to the proficient level on state content standards by 2014 have been both commended and criticized by stakeholders across the nation . Schools are expected to meet this challenge by employing only highly qualified teachers who are well versed in content and the use of evidence-based practices . They must document adequate yearly progress toward proficiency for all students , including those with disabilities . Must groups praise the accountability that accompanies these mandates ; however , concerns have been voiced by some educators about their impact on rural schools as well as their implications for special education services . Various stakeholders in rural areas across the country were surveyed to examine the perceived impact of the NCLBA mandates for highly qualified teachers and adequate yearly progress . Qualitative research methods were used to analyze responses to open ended questions asking participants to expand on special education issues related to qualifications of highly qualified teachers , documentation of adequate yearly progress and other general concerns . Some common themes emerged related to the unique circumstances of rural schools as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators and special education programs . <p> The reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Act ( IDEA ) in 2004 included provisions bringing this law into alignment with the No Child Left Behind Act ( NCLBA ) of 2001 , thereby ushering in an era of school reform for all students as well as a new perspective on equal educational opportunity for students with disabilities in the nation 's schools . Two provisions of these laws , in particular , have occasioned considerable debate : the mandate that schools must ensure that students are taught by highly qualified teachers ( HQT ) with content expertise and the mandate that schools are accountable for promoting adequate yearly progress ( AYP ) for all students . Although no one can argue with the basic premise of these mandates , many have questioned the specific requirements for achieving them . The debate has been most vigorous in discussing the implications of the law for special education and also for rural schools , especially at the intersection of many concerns in rural special education . <p> Rural schools face unique challenges in implementing both HQT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources , and often remote locations . They face difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in general ( Schwartzbeck &; Prince , 2003 ) and special educators in particular ( Brownell , Rosenberg , Sindelar , &; Smith , 2004 ) . They experience higher attrition of teaching personnel ( Ingersoll , 2001 ) , especially special education teachers ( Williams , Martin , &; Hess , 2002 ) . Consequently , their special education personnel are three times more likely to be uncertified or have minimal qualifications ( Tyler , Cantou-Clarke , Easterling , &; Klepper , 2003 ) . Rural schools also encounter difficulties in meeting AYP targets ( Jimerson , 2003 ) . They typically have fewer options for school choice and supplemental services ( Milloy et al. , 2003 ) and more limited access to staff development opportunities ( U. S. Government Accountability Office , 2004 ) . Special education service delivery is complicated by lower available funding but higher implementation costs associated with providing specialized programs in more isolated rural areas ( McLaughlin , Embler , Hernandez , &; Caron , 2005 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for special educators due to smaller staff size overall and even fewer specialists in each area ( Rude &; Brewer , 2003 ) . <p> To explore educator perceptions of the impact of the NCLBA mandate on rural special education , a national survey was conducted to solicit comments from educators , administrators , and teacher educations involved in both special and general education and living and/or working in rural communities across the country . The purpose of the study was to give voice to the concerns expressed by educators on the front line in rural schools and compare their perceptions with concerns expressed by commentators in the professional literature . Method <p> This study involved a survey ( conducted both on paper and online ) disseminated to rural areas across the United States that asked respondents to share their perceptions of the impact of the NCLBA and its provisions on rural schools . Common concerns related to implementation of this Act were identified based on a review of the literature and the legislation and a questionnaire was designed to solicit input from teacher educators , teachers and administrators , parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects was obtained prior to distribution of the survey form . Data Collection <p> The 12-item form comprised two demographic items ( role and region ) , three questions that asked participants to rate the extent to which rural schools would be affected by the mandates of NCLBA , three questions that required the participant to agree or disagree with statements about possible impacts , and five open-ended questions soliciting participant comments about specific provisions . Given the topic , inception of the project , and relevance to the audience , the survey was initially distributed as a paper copy at the annual conference of the American Council on Rural Special Education held in Orlando , FL , in March 2004 . A low response rate at the conference led to the redesign of the survey as an online form that could be distributed nationwide . A cover message plus the URL for the survey was emailed to subscribers to and reviewers of Rural Special Education Quarterly , all state offices of education , and several parent advocacy groups . Surveys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked to forward the message to appropriate stakeholders . In addition , a letter was mailed to colleges and universities with a rural service area with a request for prospective participants to complete the online survey . Finally , at the annual conference of the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children held in Albuquerque , NM in November 2004 , preliminary findings were presented and attendees were invited to complete the survey both in the presentation and at a display table . A total of 278 responses were recorded . The findings from questions one through eight of the survey were reported previously ( Kossar , Mitchem , &; Ludlow , 2005 ) . The focus of this paper is a qualitative analysis of participant responses to the open-ended questions designed to elicit their original perceptions of the NCLBA mandates and their implications for rural schools . Data Analysis <p> Qualitative research methods ( Bogdan &; Biklen , 1998 ) were utilized to examine responses to questions 9 through 13 of the NCLBA survey . Data were analyzed inductively , reflective of interpretivist research traditions ( Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All responses to each question were read and coded by responsibility ( special education or general education ) ; by role ( educator , administrator , teacher educator , or other ( related services specialist , parent , etc. ) ; and by geographic area ( using the national regional commission service areas ) . The content was then coded into common emergent themes . Due to the open-ended nature of these questions , a participant could have identified several concerns within one answer . As such , more than one theme could have been identified and coded for a specific question . To establish inter-rater reliability , two of the researchers in this study independently coded each response into a theme or number of themes , then compared each response and corresponding theme category . Response codings that were not agreed upon were discussed and agreement was sought . Final interrater reliability on all questions was higher than 95% . Results <p> Coded responses were compared by responsibility ( special education or non special education ) and role ( educator , administrator , teacher educator , and other ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed across geographic areas , so no comparisons were made for those data . The results for each question are outlined below accompanied by tables and illustrated with representative respondent comments . Question #9 . Documentation of Highly Qualified Teacher Status <p> In response to question 9 , " What do you think is required to document that a special education teacher is " highly qualified " , the overall sense appeared to be that expecting special educators to be highly qualified in all content areas is unrealistic . A special education administrator noted that : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> An examination of Tables 1 and 2 show the unique concerns of specific groups . School personnel were more likely to identify certification and certification alone as sufficient for highly qualified status . A special educator reflected that highly qualified should be met by holding : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> One respondent indicated , " I feel that special education teachers should be certified in the appropriate field . I have witnessed teachers out of their certification that do not understand the atmosphere and the work it entails . " Another respondent simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Although teacher educators recognized the importance of certification , they also identified additional factors . For example , one respondent wrote : <p> I believe that a highly qualified special education teacher is a professional who has studied the skills and knowledge , PRACTICED through a mentor the skills and knowledge and demonstrated implementation of the skills and knowledge relative to EFFECTIVE delivery of a specialized education fully intended to meet the individual and unique needs of exceptional children in any number of settings . <p> Some special education teacher educators identified student progress as a key requisite of being highly qualified . For example , one wrote , " minimum would be completed degree , completed licensure program which he or she teaches , positive evaluations when teaching , and students of this teacher making progress according to the IEP . " It is noteworthy that no administrators and few teachers ( special and general education ) identified student progress as a requirement for documenting highly qualified . Question #10 : Issues for Rural Schools in Securing Highly Qualified Teachers <p> Tables 3 and 4 display the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What issues do you think NCLB presents for rural schools with respect to securing highly qualified special education teachers ? " , most respondents considered recruitment and retention of special educators to be the major issue presented by NCLB , regardless of role or responsibility . In fact , one special education teacher educator indicated , I am not sure that new issues are developing . NCLB seems to have the effect of highlighting the existing issues . " Many respondents noted the existing shortage of special education teachers and commented that NCLB would exacerbate this problem . For example , one special education teacher wrote : <p> I think this area has been long overlooked . Highly qualified teachers leave to obtain a higher rate of pay in an urban school or another type of job . I also think that rural schools have little choice in who they can get to teach special education . There will be issues of who will pay for the additional education of teachers without certification being hired so they can be highly qualified special education teachers . Then there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different job within the school system . <p> Another special education teacher noted : <p> It is more difficult to find teachers for rural schools . This is especially true of special education teachers . To make a ruling that we must also be qualified in secondary subjects will narrow down the field to such a small group that finding a teacher will be next to impossible . <p> On the other hand , one general education administrator stated , " So far we have n't had a problem getting certified special educators . I 've found that there 's no magic in a special educator 's bag of tricks . " Interestingly , a special education teacher educator wrote : <p> Depends on what the definition for highly qualified finally becomes . If it is that teachers have a degree and licensure in special education , then it will be OK . If it is that a degree in a subject area plus special education is required , then I do n't think the positions will be easy to fill at all . <p> Surprisingly , although rural education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suggested that sanctions imposed by failure to comply with NCLB may lead to rural school closings , few of these respondents cited this as a concern . Question 11 . Documentation of Adequate Yearly Progress <p> In response to question 11 " How do you think adequate yearly progress should be documented for students with disabilities ? " , special educators were more likely to indicate progress on IEP goals than non-special educators ; although both sets of respondents identified this more than any other process . Tables 5 and 6 display the responses to this question . A response reflective of many teachers was that AYP should be documented through their IEPs : <p> IEPs are put in place for students who ca n't learn in the general ways that the majority of the population learns ; therefore making it unfair to test them in the same ways . If an IEP is written appropriately for an individual , then their adequate progress would be based on whether or not they met their goals by the end of the school year . <p> Teacher educators in special education were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other group . One teacher educator asked : What does Congress thinks the IEP is ? If the schools are documenting the IEP correctly , that is all the evidence they need . What more does a score on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills ( ITBS ) tell us about the mentally limited students that the diagnostic Multidisciplinary Team ( MDT ) process can not ? This ' business ' of testing only at grade level is ludicrous . <p> Specifying how the IEP relates to AYP documentation , another teacher educator suggested that schools : <p> Base it on the standards of the IEP and legitimize the IEP . Confirm that parents truly understand due process and written prior notice so they do not sign off on unacceptable IEPs . Administrators are key to this falling into place . Administrators must become advocates for quality education of exceptional students . <p> General education teachers ' comments were similar . One teacher wrote , " it should be documented from their IEP and their individual yearly goals not by comparing their progress with other students in their age group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to use multiple sources of data to measure progress and said , " The IEP should reflect the student 's current levels and during each progress report , the teacher should provide documentation that the student has progressed ( pictures , samples of work , graded work , video ) . " Question #12 : Issues in Ensuring Adequate Yearly Progress for All Students <p> Tables 7 and 8 display the responses to question 12 . In response to this question , " What issues do you think NCLB presents for rural schools with respect for ensuring ALL students ( including those with disabilities ) make adequate yearly progress ? " , special educators were almost twice as likely as non-special educators to indicate that NCLB did not take into consideration the particular characteristics of rural schools . For example , one special education teacher felt that rural schools were set up to tail since meeting adequate yearly progress could be based on the performance of only one or two students . Another special education teacher indicated a problem would be " insuring progress : NCLB is not taking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not enough special needs teachers . " This appears to be supported by responses coded into the theme " other factors not taken into consideration . " For example , one respondent wrote that : <p> Culture and home environment play a big part . <p> Teachers can not be the only ones who stress the importance of getting a good education . Why are n't the parents held responsible ? Teachers can be highly qualified but can not make a student learn if it is not important to them . <p> One special education administrator noted : <p> We need total family learning to meet AYP . Many families are more concerned with their basic needs than preparing their children for learning . Many of the parents are unable to meet the educational needs of children in my elementary school . <p> Special educators , particularly teachers and administrators , were also more likely to indicate that there would be pressure on teachers/students . One teacher wrote that " the teachers feel pressure which then puts pressure and too high of demands on the students . " <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BUT with the penalties districts face , students with disabilities will get the brunt of the blame . Again , it is important to look at the data of each student . NCLB defines progress too specifically , but with a more global definition , without such punitive requirements , it would be attainable . <p> When responses to this question were broken down by role , teachers were most likely to say that the emphasis on AYP would lead to diminished individualization for students , while administrators were somewhat likely to indicate this ; however , teacher educators did not indicate this at all . One administrator noted that , " from my perspective , there is not a good understanding of disabilities and special education in rural areas . This creates a situation of very little tolerance for any student out of the norm . " Further , another administrator wrote , " to leave no child behind we must look at each child individually and compare him/her to him or herself not his/her peers . " Teacher educators appeared to be more sensitive to the challenges presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rural schools . One teacher educator noted the following : Rural schools face many challenges that impact performance of their students such as poverty , low levels of education , limited resources , and cultural difference , especially as it is measured on a standardized test or the formulas used to calculate AYR Disadvantaged rural schools are generally smaller in size and may have a higher portion of students with disabilities so scores may be negatively skewed . <p> Not surprisingly , administrators were more concerned about the financial challenges presented by NCLB than other groups . One special education administrator wrote , " I fear that rural schools may be forced to prioritize resources in an effort to meet the requirements for the majority of students , resulting in fewer dollars being available for students with disabilities . " A general education administrator was quite specific in detailing the financial issues , noting that : <p> There is the issue of funding for buses to transport students to extended day or summer programs ; adequate funding for special education teachers to provide services for those students in need ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Question #13 : Other Concerns about NCLAB Impact on Rural Special Education <p> Tables 9 and 10 display the responses to question 13 . In response to this question , " What other concerns do you have related to NCLBA 's impact on rural special education ? " , non-special educators ( primarily administrators ) were most likely to note funding concerns . A commonly cited response to this question was " funding . let me say again , funding . " A general education administrator commented , " Other than creating difficulty staffing programs , unreasonable expectations , under-funding , and questionable " science , " I ca n't think of a thing . " Another administrator wrote that , " mandating requirements for success without providing the necessary funding will always force rural schools to scramble and hunt for answers to their problem at the expense of the children and the teachers . " <p> When responses were analyzed by role , educators were more likely to note the negative impact on students with disabilities and the potential for animosity towards student in special education . One special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pressure on schools that have a large number of special education students . The schools are blaming these students for their low scores . We have been trying to integrate our students and make them more acceptable to society . I 'm afraid this will set us back . Everyone will look at these students in a negative light . <p> Another teacher summed up a common theme that NCLB will distract teachers from student needs , stating " it will put pressure on teachers and the focus will no longer be on the students . " Finite Resources , Increasing Demands : Are Rural Children Left Behind ? <p> When considering data from all open-ended responses , some common themes related to the unique characteristics of rural special education emerged . One aspect of being rural is the challenge of providing services given sparse population density across sometimes wide geographic distances . A special education teacher educator noted : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The general perception was that rural schools would always struggle to find qualified special education teachers : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Another special education teacher reiterated the concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for highly qualified teachers to be " a teacher that actually wants to teach special ed. , not a teacher that takes the position just to " get their foot in the door ' . " <p> Some respondents wrote thoughtful and highly personal commentaries about their own experiences , reflecting the daunting demands placed on rural educators and their own frustrations . For example , one individual wrote : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Other respondents began to speculate about the potential ramifications of NCLB for rural schools and programs . One general education administrator noted : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Elaborating on the additional responsibilities required of a special education teacher , a special educator reflected : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The majority of the respondents agreed that recruiting and retaining teachers , especially special educators , in rural schools was challenging for a variety of reasons , such as : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> However , not all respondents saw this issue as being uniquely rural , as illustrated by this comment , " none are very different from what suburban and urban districts are experiencing . " PREFORMATTED TABLE Discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in identifying the issues presented by NCLBA mandates for special education in rural schools . Across general and special education , a variety of roles , and all geographic areas , they were unanimous in expressing serious concerns about the impact that requirements for highly qualified teachers ( HQT ) and adequate yearly progress ( AYP ) will have on students with disabilities , their teachers , and the schools who serve them in rural communities . Implications of the Mandate for Highly Qualified Teachers <p> Concerns related to the implications of the HQT mandate for rural special education center on two key issues : minimum requirements for certification as a special educator and additional endorsements in academic content areas . Although all educators commented on certification requirements as the base for considering someone to be a highly qualified teacher , experienced educators were the most vocal in asserting that certification in special education was the most important , indeed the sole , criterion for determining whether a special educator was highly qualified . This no doubt reflects their concern about the need to meet new requirements for competency in academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms whereby veteran teachers can obtain such qualifications using the Act 's provision for High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation ( HOUSSE ) ( Burdette , Laflin , &; Muller , 2005 ) . HOUSSE requirements vary from passing a standardized test to passing courses equivalent to an academic major to obtaining an additional content endorsement , which means a significant amount of additional training in some cases . Critics have argued that special educators must now meet higher expectations for certification than general educators , a situation that is likely to worsen teacher shortages in this field ( Gelman , Pullen , &; Kauffman , 2004 ) and may make it more difficult to attract personnel from diverse cultural groups ( Prater , 2005 ) . <p> Administrator comments focused on the need for teachers to have multiple certifications to be considered highly qualified , an understandable concern given their role in hiring decisions and staff development . Recent national data ( Boe , 2004 , cited in Brownell , Bishop , &; Sindelar , 2005 ) show that 80%-90% ( varies by content area ) of special educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet the definition of highly qualified teacher . The situation may be worse in rural schools where many general education teachers do not hold content endorsements in all the areas they teach ( Schwartzbeck &; Prince , 2003 ) . In addition , rural schools may need to assign special education personnel to serve multiple disability conditions as well as to teach in several content areas ( Billingsley , Carson , &; Klein , 200 ) . Although the federal government has introduced some flexibility in meeting the deadline for all teachers to be highly qualified , it applies only to very small independent school districts ( primarily in the Midwest and West ) ( Lambert &; Strange , 2004 ) . <p> Teacher educators were more likely to focus on completion of an approved program , including components such as supervised clinical experiences , as the definition of highly qualified . This not surprising finding is no doubt due to growing concern over federal and state alternative certification initiatives to address the HQT mandate ( Hardman , Rosenberg , &; Sindelar , 2005 ) , which may rely solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special education leaders have been critical of alternative certification programs , which may not develop adequate specialized knowledge and skills or promote teacher retention ( Brownell , Sindelar , Bishop , Langley , &; Seo , 2002 ; Council for Exceptional Children , 2004 ) . Teacher educators also discussed the possibility of connecting certification to documented success in accomplishing learning outcomes for students with disabilities . This concern represents their recognition of new demands for linking teacher education to teacher practices to student achievement , expressed in accreditation standards for teacher education programs published by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education ( NCATE ) ( National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education , 2006 ) ) as well as in the call for research-based practices in teacher education made by the American Educational Research Association ( Zeichner , 2005 ) . <p> All educators recognized the challenges the HQT mandate creates for recruitment and retention of special education personnel in rural schools . The need for highly qualified teachers will intensify competition across all school systems for qualified teachers and contribute to increased " teacher churn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools districts into wealthier suburban systems ( Darling-Hammond &; Sykes , 2003 ) . Recruitment problems are already significant in rural schools as a result of the low pay and geographic isolation ( Reeves , 2003 ) as well as critical shortages of special educators overall ( McLeskey , Tyler , &; Flippin , 2004 ) . Retention problems , currently caused by poor working conditions and high turnover rates of personnel because of lower salaries in rural schools , is expected to worsen as veterans consider early retirement rather than invest time , effort and money in meeting additional requirements to become highly qualified in both general education ( U. S. Government Accountability Office , 2004 ) and special education ( Thompson , Lazarus , &; Thurlow , 2004 ) . Implications of the Mandate for Adequate Yearly Progress <p> When considering the impact of adequate yearly progress ( AYP ) provisions on special education in rural schools , educators at all levels expressed concerns about the possible conflict between IDEA 'S focus on the individual education plan ( IEP ) outcomes and NCLBA 's focus on standardized test scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the IEP as the most appropriate measure of progress for students with disabilities . This is consistent with concerns expressed in the literature about the centrality of the IEP in special education ( Karger , 2005 ) and possible misalignment with IDEA 's focus on individual needs ( Yell , Katsiyannis , &; Shiner , 2006 ) . Some educators have expressed concern that increased focus on learning academic content may compromise the need for teaching more functional skills ( Spooner &; Browder , 2006 ) or preparing students for the transition to adulthood ( Collins , Hawkins , Keramidas , McLaren , Schuster , Slevin , &; Spoelker , 2005 ) . Others have questioned how IEP requirements can be met in the context of school choice when schools tail AYP ( National Association of State Directors of Special Education , 2002 ) . <p> Administrator concerns focused on the availability and deployment of school resources , both funding and personnel . Other national data indicate these responses are typical of the concerns of local special education directors ( Purcell , East , &; Rude , 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention efforts at learners who are closest to proficiency ( rather than those most in need of assistance ) to achieve the highest percentage of passing scores , essentially a form of educational triage ( Booher-Jennings , 2005 ) . Educators have suggested that schools may be less willing to implement inclusive practices to avoid sanction for failure to make AYP across all sub-groups ( Hehir , 2005 ) . <p> Respondents also identified many issues rural schools will face when attempting to achieve AYP for students with disabilities , with comments reflecting their own roles and unique perspectives . Special education teachers highlighted the many contextual factors that affect student learning and achievement , such as cultural differences , poverty status , and family involvement . Their comments about students ' reactions to testing and failing scores mirror those of the respondents in an earlier study ( Harriman , 2005 ) . Some of these educators questioned whether AYP as measured by standardized test scores is even an effective mechanism to ensure desired educational outcomes for all students , but especially for those with disabilities . Assessment experts have expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance for students with disabilities ( Ysseldyke , Nelson , et al. , 2004 ) . Teachers and administrators , in both general and special education , feared being held collectively or even individually accountable for failure of some groups to achieve AYP , when they had little control over or influence on these contextual factors . Their concerns echoed those expressed in the professional literature about the impact of sanctions on small schools when subgroups fail to progress ( Milloy et al. , 2003 ) and improvement plans that may lead to consolidation and school closures in rural areas ( Reeves , 2003 ) . How Will NCLBA Impact Rural Special Education ? <p> The results of this study of perceptions of rural educators about the impact of the No Child Left Behind Act on rural special education make it clear that there is much to be concerned about in the next few years . Their comments , while not unlike the various opinions presented in the professional literature , give a highly personal and unique diverse set of perspectives on how the mandates for highly qualified teachers and adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , and students in rural America . Jimerson ( 2004 ) argued that most state accountability systems are insensitive to the needs of and issues raced by rural schools , ignore the values and conditions of rural communities , and are likely to lead to rural school takeovers , consolidations , and closings . Sunderman ( 2006 ) has called for a re-examination of the basic tenets of NCLBA by a broad spectrum of stakeholders to ensure that the Act accomplishes its primary purpose - to promote equal educational outcomes for ALL students . A recent summary of a series of public hearings on implementation of NCLBA ( Public Education Network , 2006 ) , reported that the public supports the goals of the legislation but not its mechanisms , with participants expressing concern about the impact of narrowing the curriculum , overlooking other critical qualities of effective teachers , and putting unreasonable pressure on low performing students . Their comments sound remarkably similar to the ones submitted by the rural respondents in this study as well as the concerns expressed by special education leaders in the professional literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be answered ; how will the mandates for highly qualified teachers and adequate yearly progress be met by rural special education ? ; and , more important , given finite resources and increasing demands , will these rural children be left behind ?
