Editor - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints aggressive efforts to fund Proposition 8 remind me of the schoolyard . As a gay Mormon in Oregon , I was often pummeled in elementary school with epithets like " faggot ! " and " momohomo ! " Recess was often brutal . <p> So I did what ostracized children do - I set out to find a weaker kid to dominate . I targeted a schoolmate named Peter and verbally assaulted him in the hopes that the other kids would accept me . And I was ruthless . I should have known better . <p> As a child , I was told stories of my Mormon ancestors being mobbed and murdered for being polygamists . Evangelicals persistently denounced our faith as non-Christian . Most recently , the GOP rejected " the Mormon , " former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney . The memory of our collective emotional pain is always present . Mormons are the queer outcast of religious society . Like all kids , we just want to fit in . <p> So what does an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . Mormons have now proven that they can be as vicious as the Christians who hate them . In playground politics , the bullied have become the bullies . Should gay Americans pay the price for Mormonism 's abused inner-child ? <p> TROY WILLIAMS <p> Salt Lake City <p> Editor - Here in Santa Clara County , we have a county measure on the ballot to increase the sales tax to fund BART . This measure requires a two-thirds super majority to pass . But , a simple majority will amend the state Constitution and abolish our rights ? Yes , I am talking about Proposition 8 . <p> The next step after defeating Prop . 8 should be a constitutional amendment that requires a two-thirds majority to amend the state Constitution . After all , it takes two-thirds of the states to ratify an amendment to the U.S. Constitution . <p> LENNY GALATIOTO <p> San Jose <p> Editor - Most everyone will agree that maturity increases with age . Time gives the experience of observing both the good and bad in our world and in people 's lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successes and failures of others . <p> Teenagers are typically in the early stages of this process . It is frequently difficult for them to " think to the future " in making decisions . It is easy for them to follow the crowd or be swayed or the media . <p> The fact that an unmarried teen becomes pregnant supports this concept , and is the exact reason they need guidance from parents who are legally responsible for them . Since parents are legally responsible for their children , they must know about any changes which they , too , will be held responsible . <p> Proposition 4 assures this , while providing more than ample alternate options for teens who simply can not communicate with their parents to get the help they need . Please vote " yes " on Prop . 4 . <p> GARY GERMANO <p> Sonoma <p> Editor - Thank you for your Oct. 23 editorial endorsing SMART , the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit proposal " North Bay commuter rail . " Measure Q will provide a 70-mile commuter train and bicycle-pedestrian path from Cloverdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal . <p> Approving SMART is the single most important thing Marin and Sonoma residents can do to protect the environment and reduce global warming . <p> SMART will remove more than 1.4 million car trips from Highway 101 each year , reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 31 million pounds annually . The pedestrian-bicycle pathway will be used by 7,000 to 10,000 people per day . <p> Ridership will grow with rising gas prices , as shown by national trends . Financial analysis shows that the quarter-cent sales tax will cover the costs of developing SMART . The public already owns the right-of-way , a billion-dollar asset that should be used . <p> In addition to creating construction jobs , it will support Marin and Sonoma businesses by providing their employees and customers with faster , less expensive green transportation . Go to the end of the ballot and vote " yes " on Q. <p> MARJORIE MACRIS <p> SMART Campaign Committee <p> Mill Valley <p> Editor - Regarding " Newsom 's city car made trip to his wedding " Oct. 27 : There are several things I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimbursing the city for this outrageous expense , including overtime for two cops . Our " hands were tied , " my eye ! <p> Second , why - after all this time - ca n't the total costs be calculated ? If that 's really the case , please , Mayor Gavin Newsom , get your hands out of the S.F. city budget . And , lastly , if security of our mayor is such a priority , where do the residents stand on getting the same type of security in light of the city 's rising homicide rate ? <p> SHERRIE MATZA <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - On a recent trip to New York City , I learned that Mayor Michael Bloomberg rides the subway to work every day and the public is encouraged to come up and ask him questions , say hello or ask him for a job . Seriously . <p> Amazingly , our mayor needs his luxury , leather-appointed SUV to go 3 miles to City Hall every morning and apparently , he needs it even when he 's not in it and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to him . <p> SCOT BISHOP <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - Sex workers are currently targeted by police , pimps and their bosses . Upon the passage of Proposition K , police will no longer prosecute prostitution . Management of sex workers will be investigated for fair and legal working conditions . Crimes committed by individuals targeting sex workers will be prosecuted . <p> Opponents of Prop . K raise the issue of human trafficking and child abuse . Though these are serious crimes , they are meant to distract and mislead the voters . On the contrary , under the current law , sex workers are reluctant to report crimes against them for fear of prosecution . <p> I call all San Franciscans to take action and vote " yes " on Prop K. We do n't need money for prosecuting prostitutes . We need money for housing , education , job training and proper treatment of the issues sex workers deal with . <p> ABDI HABAD <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - At first glance , Proposition K appears to protect the rights of prostituted individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prop . K cuts all funding of service programs designed to help individuals escape exploitative prostitution and undercuts the city 's efforts to identify and rescue victims of sex trafficking . <p> By forbidding law enforcement to investigate prostitution , Prop . K eliminates the Police Department 's most effective means of encountering , identifying and saving victims of sex trafficking . Legalizing pimping thus creates an ideal environment for traffickers . <p> Furthermore , traffickers often target individuals from particular nationalities or ethnicities , yet Prop . K prohibits law enforcement agencies from applying for any grant monies allowing them to take this fact into account . <p> Prop . K eliminates the First Offenders Prostitution Program , an educational program for johns , paid for by johns , which has reduced their recidivism rates by 30 percent . <p> The only positive in Prop . K , which actually protects the rights of prostituted individuals , requires rigorous police investigation into reports of abuse , but that 's a right we can demand without cutting services to victims of sexual exploitation , crippling law enforcement 's means of identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand for commercial sex . <p> KAREN STAUSS <p> Polaris Project Washington <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
