Children and snacks are made for each other . Indeed , the smaller size of young kids ' stomachs combined with their often frenetic activity levels pretty much requires that they nibble a little something between meals . Nutritionists have long suspected , however , that changes in America 's snacking habits go a long way toward explaining why young people in the U.S. have grown so fat over the past 30 years . Just last month the Centers for Disease Control reported that 13% of children ages 6 to 11 are overweight , up from 11% in the early 1990s and 4% in the 1960s . <P> Now comes word that snacks are in fact a bigger culprit than anyone realized . By analyzing data from three national food surveys , researchers from the University of North Carolina determined that children are eating a lot more snacks than they did three decades ago . How much more ? Kids today consume 25% of their calories between meals , compared with 18% in the 1970s . The biggest changes occurred after 1989 , mirroring the rapid increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Barry Popkin , professor of nutrition at U.N.C. 's School of Public Health , was the fact that today 's snacks are packed with a greater concentration of calories than ever before . That jump in what nutritionists call " energy density " raises plenty of red flags , because the more calories per gram in a particular snack , the easier it is to overeat . <P> This high-energy trap fools lots of folks , not just kids . After all , our bellies do n't add up calories to calculate when we should feel full ; it seems to be more a question of the volume and composition of the food we eat . Consider which you would be more likely to do : reach for another chocolate-chip cookie after you 've already finished three in a row or bite into another apple after you 've polished off three apples ? If you 're like me , the cookies win hands down . Yet the average chocolate-chip cookie contains 5 calories per gram , compared with the apple 's 0.6 . Bottom line : the less calorie-dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if kids ate only fruits and veggies in the 1960s . But other popular snacks of that era were less processed , according to Popkin . " The biggest shift is away from milk and toward soft drinks , " he says . Other particularly noteworthy changes include a jump in salty snacks and the advent of " high-energy " bars that deliver , along with their vitamins , a concentrated dose of calories . <P> The solution is not to ban snacks from your household . Focus instead on those that are healthier for your children  --  and for you . Low-fat milk , a rich source of calcium , is better than sodas or juice drinks for most children . ( Kids who have trouble digesting lactose often do well with yogurt or lactose-reduced milk . ) Try freezing grapes or serving carrot sticks with salsa . But make sure you do n't create a backlash against fruits and vegetables by emphasizing how good for you they are . That only makes potato chips and brownies seem all the more appealing . <P> Meanwhile , make sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PlayStation . Physical activity will boost their metabolism and tone their bodies . They 'll also be more likely to exercise and eat right if Mom and Dad set a good example . <P> To learn more about healthy snacks , visit our website at
