By the cruel calculus of the AIDS epidemic , the best anti-AIDS drugs almost never reach the millions of people who need them most . In the face of the widespread epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa  --  where more than 25 million people are HIV positive  --  pharmaceutical companies have been under increasing pressure to supply the developing world with cut-rate medicines . But no matter how much they trim prices on a combination-drug regimen that can cost $15,000 a year in the U.S. , it 's never quite enough to make a dent in countries where per capita annual income is only a few hundred dollars . <P> Now the deadly stalemate seems to be breaking up . Last week , even as the big pharmaceutical companies went to court to keep generic copies of their drugs out of South Africa , one of the biggest of these , Merck , announced it would slash prices of two of its major AIDS drugs , Crixivan and Stocrin , an additional 40% to 55% . Other drug giants  --  including GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb  --  immediately signaled they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropic terms , but the companies have more than their reputations at stake . Generic drugmakers , like India 's Cipla Ltd. and Hetero Drugs , have already offered three-drug combos for $350 to $600 a year per patient , 40% less than the best prices offered in developing countries by Western firms . <P> By meeting this off-brand challenge , the drug companies hope to protect their franchise not only in impoverished Africa but also in the U.S. , where drug pricing has long been a target of health activists and where a price war with generics could cut deeply into profit margins . As Merck CEO Raymond Gilmartin acknowledges , unless AIDS drugs become more generally available , " our intellectual property is at risk . " <P>  --  By Frederic Golden
