<p> The Indianapolis Colts had their bye week just before Halloween , and Peyton Manning took the opportunity to visit his brother , Eli . He watched Eli quarterback the New York Giants to a win over the Washington Redskins at Giants Stadium , then dressed as Elvis when the two attended a costume party . <p> " It was really one of the more enjoyable nights I 've had , " Peyton Manning said last week . " Nobody recognized me . Well , they recognized me , but they recognized me as Elvis . I 'm going to have to bring that back to Indianapolis . Of course , I just blew my secret . " <p> That 's not the only Manning-related secret that has gotten out in recent weeks . <p> There are others , like this one : The Colts are about more than their record-setting quarterback this season . <p> Last season , Manning threw for 4,557 yards and set an NFL record with 49 touchdown passes , but again was watching the Super Bowl in February instead of playing in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 touchdowns and more than 3,800 yards . That 's not bad , but it 's a far cry from last season . The Colts are the league 's only unbeaten team , however , and the quarterback is n't complaining . <p> The Colts are 9-0 with Sunday 's no-sweat triumph over the Houston Texans , six days after they won a highly anticipated Monday night game against the New England Patriots for Manning 's first victory in Foxborough , Mass . The conjecture about their chances of joining the 1972 Miami Dolphins , who had the only undefeated season in NFL history , has begun . <p> Big tests come in the Colts ' next two games , at Cincinnati on Sunday and eight days later against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Indianapolis in a Monday night game . But this much already is clear : The Colts have supplanted the Patriots , winners of three of the last four Super Bowls , as the team to beat league-wide , and the rest of this NFL season will be about whether Manning can reach his first Super Bowl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty bad , " Patriots linebacker Willie McGinest said after his club 's 40-21 loss to the Colts . " They 're a good team , and they 're playing their best football . I do n't think they 're doing anything different . Why change anything when you have a good team like that ? " <p> But these Colts are different . They have become a more balanced club , with a greatly improved defense and an offense capable of stringing together sustained drives . Manning says he regularly is changing passing plays to running plays with audibles at the line of scrimmage , as he did on both of the Colts ' rushing touchdowns against the Patriots . <p> " I think people are surprised , " Manning said . " People are going , ' Oh , Peyton , you 've got to be frustrated with all these running plays . ' I 'm calling a lot of them myself . Offensive coordinator Tom Moore is calling a lot of pass plays , and I 'm checking to the runs . The fantasy football players do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in that situation . . . . As long as we get in that end zone and win the games , I 'm as happy as I am throwing touchdowns . " <p> Tailback Edgerrin James is on course to run for 1,826 yards , which would be 278 more than last season . Wide receivers Marvin Harrison , Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley are on pace to combine for 2,846 receiving yards and 21 touchdown catches , that after totaling 3,400 yards and 37 touchdowns last season . <p> Manning calls himself an " old-school " quarterback who gets a thrill out of outfoxing the opposing defensive coordinator , middle linebacker or safety by making the proper audible for a six-yard run . He said that defenses have resolved not to give up long passing plays to the Colts , so he and his offensive teammates merely are taking what opponents are giving them . <p> " I think they 're kind of surprised that we can play that game , " he said . " I think they say , ' Hey , there 's no way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field methodically . ' When we do that , I think it does kind of drain them a little bit . . . . We feel we can play any kind of game that we have to . " <p> Manning said he occasionally has to remind himself on the field to stay patient and not allow the Colts to revert to their old quick-strike offensive mentality . But late in the New England game , with a chance to put the contest out of reach , he did change a prescribed running play to a passing play . The result was a 30-yard touchdown pass to Harrison . " I kind of got tired of handing off , " Manning said . " But I 'm doing pretty good for the most part . " <p> The defensive shortcomings that have been perhaps the biggest factor keeping Manning from the Super Bowl appear gone . The Colts rank fourth in the NFL in total defense . The signing of defensive tackle Corey Simon just before the season , after the Philadelphia Eagles made him a free agent by rescinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolstered the run defense , and ends Robert Mathis and Dwight Freeney have combined for 16 sacks . <p> " I think we are more of a team , " Manning said . " We really kind of feed off each other . We 've got a lot of youth and enthusiasm on defense . Practices are kind of exciting . Guys are flying around . It is a little bit of a different feeling . . . . I sleep a little better at night now knowing that Dwight can go out and get a sack at any time . Safety Bob Sanders can make a huge , big hit for a fumble . You think those plays are going to happen now . It used to be you were watching , you were hoping the opposing offense would make a mistake . Now you 're kind of surprised if Freeney does n't get a sack . <p> " It 's nice to have that offense-defense camaraderie . It 's definitely the best camaraderie we 've had in terms of both sides pulling for each other and feeding off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " <p> The Colts have two more games in which they will be the overwhelming favorite and both are home . They play the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 4 and the Arizona Cardinals on Jan. 1 in their regular season finale . After they face the Bengals and Steelers , the Colts will have three taxing games remaining  --  road contests at Jacksonville on Dec. 11 and Seattle on Dec. 24 , sandwiched around a home matchup with the San Diego Chargers on Dec. 18 . <p> Coach Tony Dungy wasted no time after the New England win cautioning his players about the perils of thinking about 16-0 . " We 're a good team , and we 're good when we play our game , " Dungy said . " We 're fortunate we have some good veteran leadership , and the guys practice well and play hard . But that 's what we 've got to continue to do . You do n't win championships in September or October . You do n't win them in Week 8 . You do n't win them with one game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Patriots , who had won the teams ' previous six meetings and eliminated the Colts from the playoffs the last two seasons . He reminded his players that the Steelers beat the Patriots in the regular season last year but lost to them in the AFC title game . " It 's a game in the middle of the year that we wanted to win , and we got the win , " Dungy said . <p> Manning and many of his teammates agreed . Manning , who 'd had an 0-7 career record in Foxborough , conceded the victory was satisfying , but added : " You try to keep it in perspective . We have bigger goals we want to accomplish . "
