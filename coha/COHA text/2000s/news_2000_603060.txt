<p> &lt;&gt; From tinkering to roster shakeups , major league teams kept busy this winter readying their rosters for the 2000 season . With spring training set to start next week , Chuck Johnson , USA TODAY 's National League beat writer , looks at each team . &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; * The AL scouting report was published Tuesday . &lt;&gt; <p> Arizona Diamondbacks <p> What 's set : Starting pitching stacks up as biggest strength , led by ace LH Randy " Big Unit " Johnson , last year 's NL Cy Young Award winner . LHP Omar Daal returns as the solid No. 2 . RHP Todd Stottlemyre , beefed up to strengthen a torn rotator cuff , and RHP Armando Reynoso also return . LHP Brian Anderson , having proved his worth , supplants departed Andy Benes as fifth starter . 3B Matt Williams , CF Steve Finley and LF Luis Gonzalez are entrenched . 2B Jay Bell to get new double-play mate as NL stolen base king Tony Womack moves to shortstop from right field . Travis Lee , who lost starting first-base job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and RH closer Matt Mantei also return . <p> What 's not : Bullpen in transition after losing two effective right-handed setup men with free-agent departure of Gregg Olson , who lost closer 's job to RHP Matt Mantei last year , and sudden release of RHP Bobby Chouinard , charged with domestic battery . Team counting on free-agent signee Russ Springer and acquisition of RHP Brad Clontz . <p> Injury update : Finley broke bone in his right hand in fall at home but is expected to be ready . He also has recurring back injury that could flare up any time . OF David Dellucci recovering from surgery on left wrist . <p> Behind the seams : D'backs , 100-62 in winning the West last season , are one of 10 teams with 100-win season in ' 90s . <p> Outlook : After a relatively quiet offseason , D'backs expect to make noise in 2000 that echoes last season . They won division in just their second year . Taste of playoff action has them hungry for more . <p> Atlanta Braves <p> What 's set : Everything still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Smoltz and Kevin Millwood and LHP Tom Glavine form game 's most decorated rotation . Offensively , 3B Chipper Jones coming off NL MVP season . RF Brian Jordan , CF Andruw Jones and SS Walt Weiss other key returnees. 2B/leadoff hitter Quilvio Veras and LF Reggie Sanders are prominent newcomers . <p> What 's not : Can 1B Andres Galarraga ( cancer ) and C Javy Lopez ( knee surgery ) return with no drop in production ? Fifth starter could be LHP Terry Mulholland or RHP Bruce Chen . Pending appeal , RH closer John Rocker suspended until May 1 for inflammatory remarks in Sports Illustrated . RHPs Kerry Ligtenberg , who had 30 saves in ' 98 before missing last year , or Rudy Seanez in line to close . <p> Injury update : Galarraga ( cancer treatments ) , Lopez ( torn ligament , right knee surgery ) , Ligtenberg 33 or older by mid-May . <p> Outlook : Still rate as East 's team to beat bec ause of starting pitching . Trade with San Diego for Veras and Sanders ( for Bret Boone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also acquired in Padres deal , ready to step in if necessary . Offense could be explosive if Galarraga , who missed all of last season , and Lopez , who sat out most of the second half , return to form . Manager Bobby Cox usually makes pieces fit . <p> Chicago Cubs <p> What 's set : Slugging RF Sammy Sosa , 1B Mark Grace and LF Henry Rodriguez are returnees after a major offseason overhaul . New middle infield includes SS Rickey Gutierrez , signed as free agent from Houston , and 2B/leadoff hitter Eric Young , acquired with RHP Ismael Valdes from Dodgers in highly favorable deal . C Joe Girardi , signed as free agent from Yankees , to share duties with left-handed hitting Jeff Reed . New center fielder is Damon Buford , dealt from Boston . Valdes joins rotation with RHPs Kevin Tapani , Jon Lieber and Kyle Farnsworth . <p> What 's not : There 's optimism that RHP Kerry Wood , NL Rookie of Year in 1998 , will make complete recovery after elbow surgery , but former staff ace might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' 99 . Third base to be battle between Shane Andrews and power-hitting Willie Greene , signed as free agent from Toronto . Bullpen has weaknesses , but veteran closer Rick Aguilera could solve them with big year . <p> Injury update : Wood 's status unknown until spring training . RHP Jeremi Gonzalez ( reconstructive right elbow surgery for second time last July ) out for season . <p> Behind the seams : As franchise player of future , CF Corey Patterson , 20 , is non-roster invitee this spring at his first major league camp . He was Midwest League 's top player last year , batting .320 with 20 homers and 70 RBI at Class A Lansing ( Mich . ) . <p> Outlook : Team has improved to the point that Sosa wants to sign long-term deal . Big addition is manager Don Baylor . He commands respect as field boss with Colorado . He begins anew with a team talented enough to challenge in the Central . <p> Cincinnati Reds <p> What 's set : Starting lineup that surprised Central last year returns , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a free agent . Vaughn has been replaced by LF Dante Bichette , acquired in trade from Colorado . Returnees include CF Mike Cameron , 2B Pokey Reese , SS Barry Larkin , 1B Sean Casey , RF Dmitri Young , 3B Aaron Boone and C Eddie Taubensee . Strong bullpen , led by last year 's NL rookie of year Scott Williamson , Danny Graves , Dennis Reyes and Scott Sullivan , also returns . <p> What 's not : RHP Pete Harnisch finished last season with sore shoulder and status is uncertain . If he can go , he 'll lead rotation of LHP Denny Neagle , RHP Steve Parris and probably LHP Ron Villone and RHP Brett Tomko . OF Deion Sanders , signed to minor league deal , will try to regain baseball skills after two years away from game . <p> Injury update : Harnisch opted to forgo surgery on right shoulder in favor of rigorous rehab . Optimistic about starting spring on time . <p> Behind the seams : Thanks , in part , to emergence of Parris and Villone , Reds had NL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Outlook : With new ballpark being built , what better way to fill it than have Cincinnati native Ken Griffey Jr . roaming center field ? But the Reds wo n't feel pressed if they must stand pat . After barely missing playoffs , losing one-game wild-card playoff to Mets , they 'll be no fluke if they win Central . <p> Colorado Rockies <p> What 's set : After offseason roster shakeup , lineup is generally set . Holdovers include RF Larry Walker , 1B Todd Helton , 2B Mike Lansing and SS Neifi Perez . New starters are LF Jeffrey Hammonds ( acquired in trade from Cincinnati ) , CF Tom Goodwin ( signed as free agent from Texas ) , 3B Jeff Cirillo ( obtained in trade from Milwaukee ) and C Brent Mayne ( signed as free agent from San Francisco ) . RHP Pedro Astacio is No. 1 starter and RHP Jerry Dipoto is closer . <p> What 's not : Rest of rotation up for grabs among LHP Brian Bohanon , and newcomers Masato Yoshii ( acquired from Mets ) , LHP Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( acquired from Tampa Bay ) and RHPs Manny Aybar and Jose Jimenez ( acquired from St. Louis ) . <p> Injury update : RHP John Thomson ( surgery on right shoulder ) aims to return in May . Bohanon ( bone chips in left elbow ) expects to compete this spring . <p> Behind the seams : The signing of Perez to one-year , $ 2.2 million contract keeps Rockies ' streak alive for never having had an arbitration hearing . <p> Outlook : Acquiring speed in outfield was main offseason objective . Mission accomplished . The team finished at bottom of West last year but rates as viable contender under new manager Buddy Bell after adding 18 players to 40-man roster . <p> Florida Marlins <p> What 's set : CF Preston Wilson and SS Alex Gonzalez coming off solid rookie campaigns . LF Cliff Floyd dangerous when healthy . 3B Mike Lowell recovered from cancer . 2B Luis Castillo had breakthrough season in ' 99 . Staff ace RHP Alex Fernandez appears back in stride . RH reliever Dan Miceli acquired to fill setup role . RH Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitching staff loaded with potential , but what if RHPs Ryan Dempster , A.J. Burnett , Vladimir Nunez do n't come through ? RHPs Brad Penny , Jason Grilli and LH Michael Tejera bear watching . <p> Injury update : Double-play combo of Castillo ( shoulder surgery ) and Gonzalez ( hairline fracture of forearm ) have overcome injuries to non-throwing arms . <p> Behind the seams : Last year , Marlins were last in NL with 128 home runs and 655 RBI . <p> Outlook : Still too much youth to contend , but pitching depth is solid foundation . This could be an exciting team to watch grow . <p> Houston Astros <p> What 's set : RHP Jose Lima , a 21-game winner , becomes staff ace after NL Cy Young runner-up Mike Hampton dealt to Mets . RHP Shane Reynolds durable No. 2 starter . All-righty rotation rounded out by Octavio Dotel , acquired from Mets , Scott Elarton and Chris Holt . 1B Jeff Bagwell , 2B Craig Biggio , 3B Ken Caminiti , C Tony Eusebio and LH closer Billy Wagner all key returnees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returns with new outfield partners . Roger Cedeno , obtained from Mets , and holdover Richard Hidalgo replace CF Carl Everett ( Boston ) and RF Derek Bell ( Mets ) . <p> What 's not : Replacing Hampton 's 22 wins in rotation looms as challenge . Not as daunting but just as critical will be maintaining offensive threat without Bell and Everett . Middle relief uncertain beyond Jay Powell . SS Tim Bogar gets chance as everyday player after Rickey Gutierrez signed as free agent with Cubs . If Elarton does n't come back strongly from shoulder injury or if Holt falters , veteran RHP Dwight Gooden hoping to step in after signing minor league contract . OF-1B Daryle Ward a power threat but needs a position . <p> Injury update : Elarton ( recovering from surgery to repair right shoulder ) is throwing without pain , and Caminiti ( recovering from broken back suffered in November ) expects to be ready . <p> Behind the seams : The Astros ' Venezuelan academy has helped players such as Hidalgo , Freddy Garcia , Carlos Guillen and Bobby Abreu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years away , could be next . He struck out 148 and allowed just 108 hits in 153 innings at Class A last season . <p> Outlook : Astros were determined to get value rather than take chance on not being able to sign Hampton and Everett long term . New cast looks to be legitimate contender in pursuit of fourth consecutive Central crown . Players they got in trade  - -  Dotel , Cedeno and minor league SS Adam Everett  --  are high-upside talents . <p> Los Angeles Dodgers <p> What 's set : Staff ace RHP Kevin Brown did his part , but rest of talented starting rotation fell way below expectations last year . RHPs Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort and , particularly LHP Carlos Perez , look to rebound . They no longer have RHP Ismael Valdes , traded with 2B Eric Young to Cubs in salary-shaving deal , but veteran RHP Orel Hershiser ( signed as free agent ) will try to revive his former Dodgers magic . RHP Jeff Shaw is good closer . Shawn Green , acquired from Toronto for Raul Mondesi in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slugging LF Gary Sheffield . 1B Eric Karros , CF Devon White , SS Mark Grudzielanek , C Todd Hundley , 3B Adrian Beltre other returning starters . <p> What 's not : Beltre 's status is still uncertain , pending appeal to make him free agent after ruling that Dodgers signed him before turning 16 . Hundley 's arm strength was problem last year . He 's been working hard . Rookie SS Alex Cora might get chance to start ahead of switch-hitting Jose Vizcaino and slick fielder Juan Castro . <p> Behind the seams : Perez , said to have regained his velocity , did not allow a run in his three playoff appearances in winter ball and had a 0.00 ERA , giving up nine hits and striking out six in 13 innings . <p> Injury update : Hundley ( right elbow , continued rehab following " Tommy John " surgery after ' 97 season ) feeling good . <p> Outlook : Proud franchise has a lot to prove after falling flat last season . Talent would suggest a West contender , but everybody must get on same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHP Steve Woodard only returnee to rotation . He 's joined by RHPs Jamey Wright and Jimmy Haynes , acquired from Colorado and Oakland , respectively . Outfield returns intact with LFGeoff Jenkins , CF Marquis Grissom and RF Jeromy Burnitz.Everything else has changed , including 2B Ron Belliard and SS Mark Loretta , who take over from departed veterans Fernando Vina and Jose Valentin . Free-agent 3B Jose Hernandez ( Atlanta ) replaces Jeff Cirillo , dealt to Colorado . C Henry Blanco , obtained from Rockies , also set to start . <p> What 's not : Several candidates to vie for fourth and fifth spots in rotation , among them RHPs Jaime Navarro and Kyle Peterson . Young 1B Kevin Barker to get chance at winning job over last year 's starter , Sean Berry . RH closer Bob Wickman the incumbent , but newcomers Curtis Leskanic and Juan Acevedo also have closing experience . <p> Injury update : RHP Chad Fox ( reconstructive elbow surgery ) set for mid-March return . <p> Behind the seams : Belliard batted .295 last year , highest average of any rookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to challenge for Central crown this year , but new manager Davey Lopes promises an intensity that should make revamped cast much more fun to watch . They 'll need to be gritty to squelch disappointment over Miller Park 's opening being delayed until next year . <p> Montreal Expos <p> What 's set : RF Vladimir Guerrero is already a star and getting even better . RHP Dustin Hermanson leads talented , but young , starting rotation that benefits from addition of RHP Hideki Irabu . RHPs Javier Vasquez and Mike Thurman also to start . Ugueth Urbina one of NL 's best closers . CF Rondell White and C Chris Widger solid starters . 3B Michael Barrett , SS Orlando Cabrera and 2B Jose Vidro have a year 's experience under their belts . <p> What 's not : Peter Bergeron has edge on leadoff/left-field job . Fernando Seguignol top candidate at first . Fifth starter up for grabs . RHP Carl Pavano has edge over RHPs Jeremy Powell and Tony Armas Jr . and LHP Ted Lilly . <p> Injury update : Camp to open with everybody set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Loria has kept promise to increase last year 's $ 17 million payroll by 50% . <p> Outlook : After years of developing stars only to lose them as free agents , the Expos have made concerted effort to keep current crop of talent together . They wo n't challenge for division crown this year , but they 've got something to build on : stability . <p> New York Mets <p> What 's set:Veteran nucleus includes three-fourths of league 's best infield defense . 3B Robin Ventura and SS Rey Ordonez won Gold Gloves last season and 2B Edgardo Alfonzo deserved one . C Mike Piazza and LF/leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson other key cogs . RF Derek Bell and CF Darryl Hamilton complete solid outfield . Pitching rotation has new faces . Gone are Masato Yoshii , Octavio Dotel , Orel Hershiser and Kenny Rogers , who combined for 34 wins last season . They 're replaced by LHPs Mike Hampton ( Houston ) and BobbyM . Jones ( Colorado ) , who combined for 28 wins . Hampton joins LHP Al Leiter and RHPs Rick Reed and Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armando Benitez and venerable LH John Franco . <p> What 's not : With free-agent 1B John Olerud gone to Seattle , former Texas 3B Todd Zeile hopes to make smooth transition to first . No. 5 starter unsettled between LHPs Jones and Glendon Rusch and RHPs Dennis Springer , signed as a free agent , and Pat Mahomes . <p> Injury update : Ventura ( left knee surgery ) , Hamilton ( left knee surgery ) , Alfonzo ( sore right knee ) , Leiter ( tender left knee ) , Franco ( sore right knee ) , OF Benny Agbayani ( left elbow ) , RHP Billy Taylor ( left knee surgery ) , Benitez ( sore left ankle ) , Piazza ( sore right shoulder ) all expected to be ready . <p> Behind the seams : Defense set major league record for fewest errors ( 68 ) last season . <p> Outlook : Positioned for East challenge after busy offseason . Zeile , signed as free agent , has ability to match or surpass Olerud 's offensive production . Hampton , a 22-game winner , fills need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young players , OF Roger Cedeno and Dotel , but upgraded with proven Hampton and Bell . The future is now for manager Bobby Valentine 's club . <p> Philadelphia Phillies <p> What 's set : Strong and youthful team : CF Doug Glanville , LF Ron Gant , RF Bobby Abreu , 3B Scott Rolen , 1B Rico Brogna , C Mike Lieberthal , 2B Marlon Anderson , SS Desi Relaford . Two newcomers will help : RHP Andy Ashby , acquired in trade from San Diego , to bolster rotation ; RHP closer Mike Jackson , signed as free agent , to anchor bullpen . Former closer Jeff Brantley moves to setup role . <p> What 's not : A lot will depend on ace RHP Curt Schilling 's recovery from offseason shoulder surgery . Rotation unsettled behind Ashby and RHPs Paul Byrd and Robert Person . <p> Injury update : Schilling ( right shoulder ) out until May ; 3B Scott Rolen ( strained lower back ) ready for spring training ; 1B Rico Brogna ( arthroscopic surgery on right knee ) out 4-6 weeks , expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left shoulder ) out 6-7 months . <p> Behind the seams : Abreu , signed to three-year , $ 14.25 million deal , has .375 average with runners in scoring position , since 1995 . <p> Outlook : Additions of Ashby and Jackson raised expectations , but Schilling 's shoulder injury could lower hopes if he stays out too long . For first time since ' 93 NL championship , Phillies openly believe they can contend for division crown . Pitching holds key . <p> Pittsburgh Pirates <p> What 's set : Assuming he 's healthy , C Jason Kendall is the man . 1B Kevin Young , 2B Warren Morris , CF Brian Giles and SS Pat Meares are also locks . Top three in starting rotation include RHs Francisco Cordova , Jason Schmidt and Kris Benson . <p> What 's not : Wil Cordero , signed for three years , $ 9 million to start in right field . Also can play third if young Aramis Ramirez falters . Rookie Chad Hermansen to contend for outfield duties along with Bruce Aven , acquired from Florida . LF Al Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed to minor league contract , figures in third-base picture . Suspect bullpen lacks proven closer . <p> Injury update : Kendall ( right ankle surgery ) , Meares ( tendon surgery , left hand ) , Young ( right knee surgery ) all expected to be ready . RHP Rich Loiselle ( reconstructive right elbow surgery ) aiming for late April return . <p> Behind the seams : LHP John Smiley , who had 20 wins for the Pirates in 1991 and was traded to Minnesota , will be at spring training on minor league contract . Smiley , 34 , spent the last two seasons on DL with Cleveland and has n't pitched since September 1997 after breaking his pitching arm . <p> Outlook : A relatively young team has talent but several holes . The mission will be to keep enthusiasm growing while new ballpark , along with contending team , continues construction . <p> St. Louis Cardinals <p> What 's set : Pitching rotation has been revamped into potential strength . RHP Kent Bottenfield , who had breakthrough ' 99 , is lone holdover . Two big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Toronto . RHP Andy Benes returns as free-agent signee . Promising LHP Rick Ankiel gets his chance as likely fifth starter . 1B Mark McGwire 's power should flourish between SS Edgar Renteria and LF Ray Lankford. 2B Fernando Vina , acquired in trade from Milwaukee , is bona fide leadoff hitter. 3B Fernando Tatis , RF Eric Davis , CF J.D. Drew and C Eli Marrero part of potentially explosive offense . <p> What 's not : Trades for veteran starters came with cost . Loss of several young relief arms leave them vulnerable . New closer Dave Veres , obtained from Colorado , must step up . Health remains issue for former starters Alan Benes and Matt Morris . <p> Injury update : Morris ( surgery for torn ligament in pitching elbow ) hoping to be full strength by midseason . LHP Donovan Osborne ( left shoulder surgery ) still recovering . <p> Behind the seams : For second year in row , Shawon Dunston hopes to start season with Cardinals . The former longtime Cubs shortstop finished last year with Mets . Veteran OF Brian McRae , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training . <p> Outlook : Having addressed starting pitching , Cardinals should be able to refocus on contending in Central rather than settling for McGwire 's home-run exploits as their biggest draw . <p> San Diego Padres <p> What 's set : 1B Ryan Klesko and 2B Bret Boone , acquired from Atlanta in trade for LF Reggie Sanders , 2B Quilvio Veras and 1B Wally Joyner , will add more power . RF Tony Gwynn is hitting master . 3B Phil Nevin another key power hitter . CF Ruben Rivera coming off first full big-league season . LHP Sterling Hitchcock , rumored on trading block , leads rotation with RHPs Woody Williams , Matt Clement , Brian Meadows ( acquired from Florida for reliever Dan Miceli ) and Brian Boehringer . RHP Trevor Hoffman one of game 's best closers . RHP Donne Wall top setup man . C Carlos Hernandez set to come back strong from Achilles ' injury that sidelined him last year . <p> What 's not : RHP Carlton Loewer , acquired from Phillies for ace Andy Ashby , broke both lower bones in left leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break at earliest . Trade of Veras and Sanders leaves no proven leadoff or No. 2 hitter . LF Eric Owens hoping to win job . SS Chris Gomez , coming off knee surgery , being pushed for job by speedster Damian Jackson . Backup catching job up for grabs between switch-hitting Ben Davis and impressive Wiki Gonzalez . <p> Injury update : Boehringer ( shoulder surgery ) expected to be ready by first spring game . Hernandez ( ruptured Achilles ' tendon ) played this winter and is 100% . <p> Behind the seams : Third-base coach Tim Flannery has released CD , Pieces of the Past , and will donate proceeds to bring underprivileged kids to Padres games . <p> Outlook : Lineup should be more potent than last year 's speedy aggregate that had trouble scoring . Padres also got younger , which probably means they 're couple of years from serious contention . <p> San Francisco Giants <p> What 's set : The makings of a dominant rotation in place with RHPs Russ Ortiz , Joe Nathan and Livan Hernandez and LHPs Kirk Reuter and Shawn Estes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of new 3B Russ Davis ( signed as free agent from Seattle ) , everyday lineup mostly intact : CF Marvin Benard , LF Barry Bonds , 2B Jeff Kent , 1B J.T. Snow , RF Ellis Burks and SS Rich Aurilia . <p> What 's not : C Doug Mirabelli favored to earn job ahead of Bobby Estalella ( acquired in trade from Phillies ) , but free-agent departures of Brent Mayne and Scott Servais could leave them thin . <p> Injury update : Burks ( arthroscopic surgery , both knees ) will be ready for spring training . Nen ( elbow surgery ) doing well but will be brought along slowly . Bonds ( arthroscopic right knee surgery ) ready to go . Snow ( arthroscopic left knee surgery ) will start slowly but should be 100% by middle of spring training . Kent ( inflamed toe , left foot ) will tough it out . <p> Behind the seams : First exhibition game at new Pac Bell Park in San Francisco will be March 31 vs . Brewers . <p> Outlook : Not much depth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-time NL MVP Bonds should keep Giants in thick of West race . <p> New faces <p> Teams that have changed the most : <p> Colorado : Gained needed speed in the outfield . <p> Chicago : Getting Ismael Valdes and Eric Young from Los Angeles was a steal . <p> Milwaukee : Shakeup from top to bottom overdue . <p> New York : Taking direct aim at the Braves . <p> St. Louis : Darryl Kile , Pat Hentgen , Andy Benes lead a call to arms . <p> New managers <p> Chicago : Don Baylor <p> Colorado : Buddy Bell <p> Milwaukee : Davey Lopes <p> Where is . . . <p> 3B Todd Zeile : He left the Rangers to become the Mets ' first baseman . <p> OF Derek Bell and LHP Mike Hampton : Key Astros were dealt to the Mets in a big trade . <p> RHP Andy Benes : Bolted Arizona to reunite with St. Louis pitching coach Dave Duncan . <p> OF Dante Bichette : Will roam left field for the Reds instead of the Rockies . <p> 3B Jeff Cirillo : Brewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @
