Like many Catholics of their generation , Daniel Harrington 's family was n't made up of Bible readers . Harrington recalls two Protestants coming to his house when he was a child . " We 'd like to discuss the Bible , " they said , to which his mother replied , " We 're Catholics . We do n't read the Bible . " Harrington , however , has spent his professional life helping Catholics do just that , not only by teaching scripture for decades but by preaching Sunday after Sunday in the same two parishes for many years . " One of the pastors used to stand at the entrance of the church and tell people they got three college credits for the liturgy , " Harrington says of his preaching style . For Harrington , though , reading the Bible is not just intellectual but spiritual as well . " Immersing oneself in scripture wo n't necessarily make this or that decision easier for you , " he says . " But it does help answer big questions such as : Who am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I get there ? " Harrington admits that Catholics have yet to fully embrace the Bible as their own . " I think religious education perhaps has n't emphasized the Bible enough , " he says . " But the Sunday readings are a great tool for people to learn the Bible . People sometimes do n't realize how much Bible they 're exposed to . " Harrington sees facilitating that encounter as part of his job . " A preacher has to help people get familiar with the scriptures-and not be afraid of them . " The editors interview Daniel Harrington , S.J. What are the dominant images of Jesus in our culture ? My sense is that it depends on age . I think people 65 and up probably take as their dominant image the Son of God . The middle generation probably takes the Son of Man , because they want to identify with the humanity of Jesus . Younger people ? I have no idea what image of Jesus they have . Probably more like a wise teacher or a good example . In a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and place tends to pick and choose among the many images of Jesus in the New Testament . I 'm always struck , for example , that one of the earliest descriptions of Jesus is as " Lord Jesus Christ . " Jesus ' death was in the year 30 , and the first Pauline letter was around 51 , yet Paul uses the title " Lord Jesus Christ " as if everybody already knows of it , as if everybody accepts it . But the components of that title are enormously significant . To call Jesus " Lord " is to use a word that was used for God and also for the emperor . And to call him " the Christ " means the Messiah , but in Paul 's letters it 's already functioning as almost a kind of surname . It seems so familiar to the people Paul addresses that he does n't have to explain it . He simply says , " Lord Jesus Christ . " So the early Christian communities quickly associated Jesus with God ? Yes , as well as using him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has obvious political dangers associated with it . And as one scholar describes it , the development of belief around the person of Jesus was not a development . It was an explosion . What story best illustrates Jesus as the Son of God ? The confession of Peter at Caesarea Philippi in Matthew ( 16:13-20 ) . In Mark , Peter says simply , " You are the Christ . " But Matthew adds a qualification : Here Peter says , " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . " That 's a step up , and the title Son of God is then woven even more into John 's gospel , where Jesus becomes the Word of God and the revelation of God . I think each gospel in its own way has what we call " high christology , " an understanding of Jesus as somehow sharing in God 's divinity . Perhaps Jesus ' contemporaries saw him as a prophet speaking for God , but the four canonical gospels all portray him as much more than a prophet . Pope Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strong point that the gospels present Jesus as not simply a human figure but a divine figure as well . And if you read the gospels with sympathy and not fight against them , I think you have to acknowledge that the pope has made a very important theological point . If you wanted to focus more on the humanity of Jesus , what stories from the gospels illustrate that ? One would be the temptation stories , where , according to Matthew and Luke , Jesus has to contend with temptations to physical pleasure , fame , a spectacular show , and political power . At each point he rejects these temptations . These are temptations that every human being is prey to in some form or other . Here Jesus identifies with humanity and shows himself to reflect the best of humanity . Mark likes to focus on the emotions of Jesus , while the other evangelists tend to omit those references . In the first chapter of the gospel , in the healing of the man with leprosy , Jesus is angry . What he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil or the power of Satan . He also shows compassion in the same story . So Mark 's emphasis on the emotions of Jesus would be an example of Jesus ' humanity . Can you introduce Jesus through the lens of each one of the four gospels ? They all share a common stock of titles : Son of Man , Son of God , Son of David , Lord , Messiah . Those are foundational . But they each take a distinctive approach to the figure of Jesus . For Matthew Jesus is a teacher , and so he has Jesus giving five great speeches , beginning with the Sermon on the Mount in Chapters 5 through 7 . While Mark wants to show that Jesus is a wise teacher and a powerful healer , in that gospel Jesus is also the suffering Messiah . For Luke Jesus is the great example . In other words he practices what he preaches . This comes up especially in Luke 's narrative of the death of Jesus , in which Luke highlights three things that Jesus taught throughout his career : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the so-called good thief ; and trust in God , as in Jesus ' last words , " Into your hands I commend my spirit " ( Luke 23:46 ) . In John , Jesus is the revealer and the revelation of God . He 's the Word of God in the sense that he reveals what 's on God 's mind , but also he 's the revelation of God in the sense that if you want to know what God is like , look to the person of Jesus . What about Paul ? How does he present Jesus ? Paul emphasizes almost entirely Jesus ' death and Resurrection and their significance . He 's interested in the saving effects of Jesus ' paschal mystery . Only a few times does he ever quote a teaching of Jesus . And in one case- the teaching about marriage and divorce - Paul seems to give an exception to Jesus ' absolute rejection of divorce . Paul did n't meet Jesus personally . His experience was with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus . Obviously it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . What do these specific portraits of Jesus tell us about each writer 's community ? Matthew was writing for a predominantly if not exclusively Jewish-Christian community . And the teacher was a very important element in the Judaism of the time ; there is great interest in what Jesus teaches . I think what Matthew wants to say is that Jesus is the authoritative interpreter of the Old Testament law , of the Torah . And that he 's also the wisest teacher of all , precisely because of who he is- the Son of God . I would place Mark in Rome around the time of Nero and shortly thereafter . It seems that Mark 's community was under a threat of persecution , and they had to come to grips with the mystery of the cross . In this portrayal , Mark hoped they 'd find help in the midst of persecution by identifying with the suffering Messiah . It 's hard to place Luke , but what Luke wants to present basically is , as I said , Jesus as the exemplar . Some think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between rich and poor . With stories like the parable of the rich man and Lazarus , with lines like Blessed are you poor , " Luke wants to urge the rich to take a more positive attitude toward the poor and act now before it 's too late . John 's gospel is not so much a kind of individual composition as it is a witness to a strand within Christianity , the Johannine strand , which is different from the other gospels . There was a tension , as there is in Matthew 's gospel : After the temple is destroyed and the land is even less under Jewish control , how does the heritage of Israel continue ? Both Matthew and John try to show that Jesus is the fulfillment of Judaism . Most important of all for John is that what looks like a defeat- the Crucifixion - is in fact a victory . John deals with the same question that Mark was dealing with : how to explain the death of Jesus . He explains it positively , as part of Jesus ' exaltation and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus are cobbled together from all four gospels . Is that good or bad ? You lose perspective . By following an individual evangelist , I think you are better able to think the different writers ' thoughts and see what they saw . One way we already do this is with the Sunday lectionary , which leads us through a three-year cycle of readings at Mass . One year we stand beside Matthew , the next year Mark , the year after that Luke , and we hear John from time to time . You can become attuned to the distinctive features each of them brings to the story of Jesus . I think this is analogous to what goes on in present-day biographies . There are probably hundreds of biographies of Winston Churchill or Martin Luther King Jr . Should we only have one ? Or should we have several ? Each of these biographies approaches the story of their subject from its own perspective . Roy Jenkins ' biography of Churchill is entirely political . He 's not interested in Churchill 's alcoholism or his manic depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political figure , and it 's a brilliant book . In Taylor Branch 's three-volume biography of Martin Luther King Jr. , Branch focuses on how King figures within American society from the mid-1950s up through his assassination in the late ' 60s . He covers the place of the black church and other topics . But again , it 's one perspective , and there are other perspectives not covered there . Can we ever get to the " real Jesus " ? If you think you 've got the real Jesus here , you 're sadly mistaken . History can never give you the real anybody , not the real Ronald Reagan or the real John F. Kennedy or the real whomever . What you get is aspects of the person . Often people get the impression that some professor somewhere has discovered the real Jesus behind all the details the gospels include . If you look at the books on the quest for the historical Jesus in recent years , however , I think they do tell us something very important . We as Christians believe Jesus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place . He communicated in certain ways . And the more you know about those things the better . How do you help someone get to know Jesus through scripture ? The spiritual contemplation of St. Ignatius is a good starting point for helping people to develop a personal relationship with Jesus because that method basically gets you into the story . You become a participant , and thus you develop a relationship with Jesus . This is an exercise of the imagination . Take the multiplication of the loaves and fishes . You situate yourself ; you 're told , " Sit on the ground and we 'll provide food for you . " What do you see ? What do you hear ? What do you smell ? The application of the senses allows you to identify with an onlooker or with one of the disciples , even with one of the disciples who thinks this is all a bad idea . By exercising the imagination , one can insert oneself into the story and thus into a more personal relationship with Jesus . What if you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites from across the gospels ? I 'd start with the prologue to John 's gospel ( 1:1-18 ) . It provides the New Testament context for the divinity of Jesus and echoes back to Genesis , which also starts , " In the beginning . " I think it 's a very important text . The Sermon on the Mount , Matthew 5 through 7 , outlines what the disciple of Jesus should strive for and includes the Beatitudes . Another would be Mark 8 , the confession of Peter . That 's a great turning point in Mark 's gospel , as it is in all the other gospels . The prodigal son , only in Luke ( 15:11-32 ) , would be a representative parable because it emphasizes God 's mercy and raises the question of what happened to the older son . We never find out whether he decided to change his mind and go to the party , or whether he just ran away . And obviously the fifth and final would be the Passion narrative . I like all of the death scenes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark 14:62 . All through Mark 's gospel , when people would give Jesus titles such as Messiah or Son of Man , he would say , " No , no , keep this silent " He only publicly accepts the titles of Messiah , Son of God , and Son of Man at his lowest possible moment- that is , when he 's been condemned by his own people . The truth is that he can only be understood on the cross . Are there any rules of thumb to keep in mind when reading the gospels ? I think you have to have some appreciation for the Old Testament as a source for the New Testament . You find references to the Hebrew scriptures throughout the entire New Testament . Second , these books were written in areas controlled by the Roman empire , which had introduced a certain peace within its boundaries . The Romans got rid of many of the pirates , and they made the roads better . This promoted the spread of the gospel . Travel was relatively easy , so that people like Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result fairly early the gospels begin to circulate around the Mediterranean world . They became unmoored , as it were , from their original historical and community contexts and soon became general information , taken up by a variety of Christian communities . Third , it helps to know about the cultural assumptions of the GrecoRoman world . Take the importance of honor and shame , for example , which plays a part in the debates between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees . They pose a question to Jesus and think they 've trapped him . He extricates himself from the trap , and thus he comes away with the honor , and they go away with the shame . The Greco-Roman hierarchical structure featured a few people up top , a lot of people down at the bottom , and some people in between . It 's also a patriarchal society in which men are more important than women , where women are supposed to be subordinate to the men . These are all cultural assumptions , and often they make it difficult for 21st-century Americans to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people in the first century to us seems offensive . In light of these , what do you make of Jesus ' encounter with the Syrophoenician woman in Mark ( 7:24-30 ) , where a foreign woman asks for her child to be healed , and Jesus insults her . That 's a wonderful example because it 's the only debate Jesus seems to lose . He wins all the other ones , besting the scribes and the Pharisees and the priests . But this Gentile woman seems to get the better of him . In the same story in Matthew ( 15:21-28 ) , she asks Jesus to heal her daughter , and he refuses on the grounds that " I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . It is not fair to take the children 's food and throw it to the dogs . " And she says , " Yet , even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters ' table . " Now you can read that story two ways . One is that this is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she passes the test . Or you can read it in a way that I prefer myself , which is that Jesus gets his horizon widened , and he then ministers to the daughter of this pagan woman . It 's interesting that a non- Jewish woman is the only one who gets the better of Jesus . Matthew 's version also presents her as a " Canaanite woman , " Canaanites being the enemy of Israel from way back when . He is reinforcing the point that again , this is a non- Jewish woman who seems to get Jesus to do something that at first he did not want to do . Are there any bad habits that people bring to reading scripture ? One is having an excessive reverence for the text . In other words , reading everything as if it were a factual newspaper account . Or not understanding the humor in the text . Not getting the joke as with the Syrophoenician woman . Or in Mark 5:1-20 , where Jesus casts the evil spirits into pigs . For a first-century Jew that would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notice that the demons in that story identify themselves as " legion , " which of course refers to a Roman legion , the occupying force in the region . That adds to the humor . Further , by not appreciating the genres of the text and reading everything as if it was the same kind of literary form , people can go astray . Not every part of the scripture has to be some kind of cosmic statement . Sometimes the text is just talking about runaway slaves , as in Paul 's Letter to Philemon . Philemon 's slave , Onesimus , runs away , and Paul wants to send him back , but he wants Philemon to accept him as a brother in Christ . It 's very practical , not cosmic . If you could have been present for any of the gospel stories , which one would it be ? The first chapter of Mark 's gospel beginning with verse 21 . Mark presents it as a typical day in the ministry of Jesus with teaching , healing , and all sorts of interesting things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful places on earth , beside the Sea of Galilee , a beautiful setting , unspoiled still . Every time I visit there I read the first chapter of Mark .
