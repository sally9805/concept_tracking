<p> Four diners gave up their reservations at the venerable Chez Panisse on a recent Monday night to sit on the floor in a dimly lit house in Rockridge and bump knees with strangers . A cook from Chez Panisse was there , as was the executive chef of San Francisco 's Mecca . <p> They were at Ghetto Gourmet  --  one of the hottest restaurants in the Bay Area that you have never heard of . And that 's by design . <p> Ghetto Gourmet is n't listed in the phone book . Nor will you find it by cruising Rockridge 's restaurant row on College Avenue in Oakland . Ghetto Gourmet has no sign . It has no wine list . It does n't even have chairs . <p> What this unlicensed , underground restaurant does have is a pit bull named Shinobi , a cramped kitchen with appliances in various states of disrepair and a gregarious host named Jeremy Townsend who , in his untucked shirt and jeans , will dance with his guests , jam on his harmonica and invite patrons for a post-dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in looking for new ways to captivate a public that , having made Zagat a household name , is finding its food savvy turn into ennui . <p> Culinary speakeasies like Ghetto Gourmet are popping up in cities in the Bay Area and beyond , across the country and around the world . <p> Part of the thrill , of course , is the hipness factor , the ego-inflating **43;6171;TOOLONG feeling that comes with being on a VIP list . But underground diners also can find surprisingly good food at bargain-basement prices . <p> In two years , Townsend has attracted a steady following at Ghetto Gourmet , which he runs out of his rented Craftsman home on occasional Mondays . Word of mouth , and sporadic Craigslist postings , have brought out friends , friends of friends and adventurous diners eager to fork over $30 for four courses of the likes of pan-seared duck and chevre crepes . <p> The health department  --  and fear of salmonella  --  be damned . <p> " It 's sort of an anti-restaurant , " said Townsend , 29 , a poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has amassed an e-mail list of 1,200 interested parties . " The restaurant experience is very stale . People are usually disappointed , or at least not awestruck . " <p> That goes for chefs as well , some of whom moonlight at these illegal ventures for either a creative escape from restaurant rules or a way to fulfill their dreams of opening a restaurant  --  without actually doing it . <p> " It 's literally like playing restaurant . You can create the event , and then it 's over , " said Veva Edelson , who ran a weekly underground restaurant out of her home near Humboldt State before opening Firefly in Noe Valley , which she co-owned for 10 years . " When you have a business , you create the event over and over , day in and day out  --  and you have to . " <p> Edelson , who recently relocated to Penland in rural North Carolina to study ceramics , has just started another underground venture , with a friend who had his own underground brunch restaurant in Santa Fe . Shady 's Cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay what they think the food is worth , or what they can afford . <p> " There 's a spirit of generosity involved , " Edelson said . " Everyone has a little more liberty to be playful than they would in a real restaurant . " <p> Underground restaurants are mainstays in Cuba , where home-based paladares started off as illegal ventures but are now state-sanctioned businesses . Hong Kong 's si fang cai , or speakeasies , are known as some of the island 's best eateries . <p> Homegrown supper clubs have gotten press in Paris and Prague , and one of the best known in the United States  --  Ripe in Portland , Ore .  --  has since parlayed its organic , 30-person " family suppers " into one of that city 's best  --  and now legal  --  restaurants . <p> Closer to home , Mamasan 's Bistro in the Mission has been dishing up Asian-Latino fusion cuisine at an underground hip-hop supper club in an unmarked Victorian flat for six years . Two Sonoma County chefs run a roving restaurant called the Blind Pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , no Zagat Survey of underground restaurants , and no way to quantify just how many there are . <p> Some underground restaurants are more protective of their locations , and even their existence , than of their secret recipes  --  allowing in only those newcomers who are accompanied by a previous guest or a friend of the owner . Others , like Ghetto Gourmet , operate just under the surface , with Web sites , e-mail lists and fairly liberal admission policies . <p> " People e-mail and ask , ' What do I have to do to get on your guest list ? ' " Townsend said . " I reply , ' You 've done enough . ' " <p> Except for that time when the e-mail came from someone in the Alameda County district attorney 's office . <p> " I said , ' If you 're coming to bust us , you probably should n't come . If you 're coming to eat , that 's cool , ' " he recalled . The writer never responded . <p> The danger , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have teams of sleuths digging up underground restaurants , officials point out that eating establishments are regulated for good reason . <p> " You take your chances that you wo n't get sick if you eat food from a facility that 's unlicensed , " said Susan Strong , a retail food program specialist for the state . While restaurants are inspected by local health departments , state law requires the use of commercial equipment , standardized procedures for handling food , and a state-certified food safety manager on site . Even caterers are n't allowed to work out of home kitchens . <p> " The whole point of this is to give the consumer peace of mind that food is coming out of a commercial kitchen , prepared with the right equipment and handled properly , " said Strong , adding that risks include salmonella and potentially fatal E. coli . <p> While individuals are allowed to hire home chefs to throw dinner parties , underground restaurants do n't meet this exemption because the host " does not necessarily know the people coming through the door , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll typically go looking for an underground restaurant only if there are complaints , it is possible to get caught . <p> Such is the cautionary tale of Digs Bistro , a monthly restaurant Jesse Kupers ran out of his home near Oakland 's Lake Merritt for two years , regularly selling out two nights a month for $35 , five-course , prix fixe dinners . <p> " We were very nervous in the beginning , " recalled Digs chef Justin Sconce , 32 , whose real job is cooking at the well-respected Rivoli in Berkeley . " But then we were selling out and riding high on the popularity . We started to think we were untouchable . " <p> Following a neighborhood dispute unrelated to Digs , Kupers , 30 , received a notice in October from the city of Oakland to shut down his " illegal cabaret "  --  complete with a $3,000 fine . He does n't believe it was a coincidence . <p> While Kupers , who , ironically , works as an inspector for the city , had taken preventative steps in case he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , billing the dinners as " art shows " with free food  --  <p> he decided not to fight it and was able to have the fine reduced to $300 . <p> Digs served its last meal just before Halloween , impressing both regulars and newcomers with a butternut squash soup garnished with coconut milk and sriracha chile sauce , duck confit in scallion crepes with grilled persimmons , and a fried sage and pecorino souffle served atop diced apples and cucumbers in a balsamic reduction . And those were just the starters . <p> The dinners took longtime friends Kupers and Sconce two days to prepare , and included $400 shopping trips to the Berkeley Bowl , boiling chickens for soup stock , ironing tablecloths and stowing the living room couch and media center in the two small bedrooms in the Craftsman flat . <p> But the duo , and their friends , managed to create the illusion that Digs was a real restaurant , with black-shirted waiters attentively serving guests , votives on the tables and original art propped between the picture rail and box-beam ceiling of the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rave , with a racially diverse crowd of diners ranging from twentysomething hipsters to fiftysomething suburbanites . <p> " I think the food is amazing , " said Phyllis Krekel of Piedmont , who , on Digs ' last night , dined with friends from Walnut Creek , all in their 50s . " I love the intimate setting . " <p> " And the imminent danger , " quipped her husband , Kevin . <p> At a nearby table , Juwen Lam of Berkeley was celebrating her 30th birthday with friends who were raving about their Hoffman Farm quail and wild mushroom ravioli . Lam called it " just one step down " from San Francisco 's Gary Danko . <p> " It 's the perfect place , " said Lam , who initially found Digs though a food-loving friend . " It 's better than going to a restaurant . It 's more comfortable and homey . ... Every mouthful is kind of a surprise . It seems like they take more risks than a regular restaurant . " <p> Meanwhile , in the kitchen Kupers remodeled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Sconce were celebrating the passing of their enterprise with their staff of former housemates and friends  --  and no small amount of Jameson Irish whiskey  --  as Stevie Wonder 's " Do n't You Worry ' Bout a Thing " blared on the CD player . <p> " I 'm almost glad we 're being shut down . It spurs us in the direction we want to go in , " said Kupers , who dreams of opening a real restaurant . But that wo n't happen any time soon . While the duo each earned about $500 a month from Digs , it takes thousands to launch a restaurant . Instead , they may start an upscale takeout joint . <p> But " it wo n't be as wholly a labor of love as this was . It will become a job , " Kupers said . " I 'm sure we 'll look back and say these were the best times of our lives . " <p> While Digs masqueraded as a restaurant , Townsend 's Ghetto Gourmet describes itself as a modern-day salon where interesting strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mad Libs , or composes haiku about his guests . <p> " You can smoke or make out on the front porch or back porch , but we have to keep our voices down , " Townsend told a recent Monday gathering , setting the tone for the evening . <p> Thirty-nine people sat on pillows around knee-high tables and did their best to cut through lamb chops with butter knives while making small talk with strangers . No one complained . The photocopied menu  --  featuring a skull and crossbones in a chef 's hat  --  warns diners to hold on to their forks . <p> " Every time I come , I have a great time and meet new people , " said Serge Santiago , executive chef of Mecca . Townsend started Ghetto Gourmet with his brother , Joe , who cooked under Santiago . Joe no longer lives in the area , and Townsend brings in different chefs on different nights  --  including a Mexican herbalist who once served up rabbit adobo and fried grasshoppers . <p> " It 's very off-the-cuff , very casual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's very unique . " <p> Ruth Stroup , 44 , of Oakland , was on her first visit , but that did n't stop her from creating a makeshift dance floor with Townsend while a blues guitarist played . <p> The stockbroker and financial planner came for the food , but admitted being intrigued by the illegal nature , and not at all concerned about food poisoning . <p> " I think the pursuit of pleasure is not an acceptable activity anymore , " Stroup said . " To me , it 's not illegal . It 's about freedom . " <p> While an underground restaurant such as Townsend 's may not be too hard to find , do n't despair if Google searches come up empty for most . Even those in the know sometimes do n't know where to look . <p> " I feel really cool running the underground restaurant in Oakland , " Townsend said . " I always said I 'd feel even cooler if I got invited to one of the other ones . <p> " I never did .
