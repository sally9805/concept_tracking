These twins were born attached at the chest . Could they be separated ? Their parents had faith . A year later , this is the family 's story . // To Melissa Buckles , the autumn afternoon when she had the ultrasound felt light and full of promise . She and her husband , Kevin-a Marine who served in the famous drum and bugle corps-were expecting their second child , and Melissa , then 30 , was 18 weeks along , with two sonograms already behind her . Both had indicated that everything was fine . At this appointment , a few weeks before Thanksgiving , the couple felt none of the usual anxiety-today they were just going to find out whether the baby was a boy or a girl . The technician started the scan , and Melissa and Kevin watched the monitor eagerly as the wand moved across Melissa 's belly . She was so huge already , the high school students she taught were joking about whether she might be carrying more than one baby . Sometimes Kevin teased her too . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he 'd say . Nonetheless , when the technician paused for a moment and then asked if there were twins in the family , the couple just laughed and said no . The tech asked if they were sure , and , still laughing , they asked why . " There 's one head , " said the tech , pointing to the monitor . " And there 's the other head . " Kevin and Melissa looked at each other in delight . The surprise had barely sunk in when the technician suddenly asked something else . " Are you Christian ? " Melissa 's laughter froze . " I knew something was wrong , " she says now . " Who asks that in the middle of an ultrasound ? " She remembers her response : " Yes , but why do you ask ? " " Well , " the tech said , breaking all protocol , " this is going to be a long pregnancy for you , because they 're conjoined . " Melissa struggled to process the devastating news . This should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to healthy mothers with good prenatal care , with no history of troubled pregnancies or birth defects . A doctor hurried into the exam room and studied the monitor-then she offered the shaken parents a sliver of hope : The babies were fused at the chest and abdomen , from breastbone to navel , but they appeared to have their own hearts and stomachs , so it was possible that , after birth , they could be surgically separated . It looked as if they shared a liver , but that was n't necessarily a problem . As the only human organ capable of regenerating itself , the liver could be split and shared between them . Kevin and Melissa seized on the hope the doctor had extended . As long as there was a chance that these babies could survive and live a normal life , their parents would do everything possible to make that happen . And filled with that determination , the couple set off on a frightening journey to save their children . What they were up against Because Kevin was a Marine , Melissa was referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A facility famous for treating presidents , the hospital also has a high-risk-pregnancy team , and Melissa was scheduled to see them immediately . But Bethesda was a 30-mile drive from the family 's Virginia home , and a fierce thunderstorm was raging , so the couple decided to wait until morning . That gave Melissa a long night to search the Internet for information about conjoined twins . Each Web site seemed grimmer than the last , and Kevin found her sobbing . " I was terrified , " she remembers . What Melissa learned that night was that conjoined twins are the rarest of human births . One frequently cited estimate is that , globally , only 700 sets of such twins survived long enough to be delivered , and many of those lived for only a few days after their birth . Statistically , then , the odds against the Buckles twins were staggering . Beyond that , Melissa could find almost no information . After Kevin finally pried his tearful wife away from the computer , they made a decision : They would tell only their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , then two , was too young to understand anything other than that she was about to become a big sister . But Kevin 's son from a previous relationship , Kevin Jr. , absorbed the news with a seventh grader 's curiosity : How did the babies get that way ? How would they look ? There was n't much his father could tell him . The next morning in Bethesda , the doctors had news for Melissa : She could work for two more weeks but would then need to go to bed for the duration of the pregnancy . They also pointed out the alternative scenario : that the pregnancy could be terminated . But not for a moment did the couple consider that option . They wanted the babies to be born-so it was encouraging to hear , from obstetrician Christian Macedonia , M.D. , that the twins ' having made it to 18 weeks was a good sign ; most conjoined fetuses are miscarried much earlier . However , it was unlikely that Melissa would carry the babies full term . As the fetuses grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other life-threatening scenarios . To the small army of specialists who would become involved in their case , the twins became Baby A and Baby B. Kevin and Melissa gave them different just-for-now names : Hope and Faith . In this and other ways , the twins were beginning to have their own identities . More sophisticated imaging showed them in such vivid 3-D detail that Melissa and Kevin could not only watch the girls yawn but also see individual hairs on their heads . Except for being conjoined , the babies seemed to be developing normally , and Melissa remembers that " sometimes it looked like one was whispering in the other 's ear . Dr. Macedonia called them tiny dance partners . " In their favor , long term , was the fact that the babies were biracial , and girls rather than boys . For reasons experts ca n't readily explain , African-American females have the highest rate of survival among conjoined twins . At this first visit , Dr. Macedonia gave the Buckles babies an 80 percent chance of making it . A dramatic delivery Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-thick umbilical cord that the babies shared was draped across one girl 's neck . Doctors decided to admit Melissa to the hospital and care for her there until the twins were born . The cord soon shifted naturally , but " the doctors were very , very cautious , doing two or three ultrasounds a day , " Melissa recalls . They also gave her steroid shots to help develop the girls ' lungs . Seeing so many high-tech images of their daughters in the womb , Kevin and Melissa grew accustomed to the sight of two babies fused as one . " We were mentally prepared for what it would look like , " Melissa says , and the shock they 'd initially felt at the sight was replaced by an overwhelming feeling of tenderness for their girls . At the same time , says Kevin , " we did n't buy any baby furniture , any baby clothes , any baby anything . " Melissa adds , " That would have been too much of an emotional investment . " In her 33rd week , and after three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the babies ' heartbeats slowing , Dr. Macedonia scheduled a C-section for the morning of February 26 , 2004 . As she lay on the operating table , waiting for the epidural to take effect , Melissa could feel a nurse scanning her belly for fetal heartbeats-but they were fading . Melissa was in trouble too : Pressure on a major vein was cutting off her own circulation . She remembers saying something about not feeling so great and then suddenly hearing the doctor 's voice : " We have to go now ! It 's a crash ! " Kevin , out in the hall making a phone call , saw carts and medical staff rush past him into the delivery room . The epidural still had n't taken hold , so as the scalpel sliced into her , Melissa felt everything . " The pain was excruciating . For a week , I had marks on my palms from my fingernails digging in , " she recounts . The delivery , which had been rehearsed repeatedly by the high-risk-pregnancy team , took barely a minute . Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tackle a nurse who was in the way . " Go check the babies , go check the babies , " his wife implored . The girls were breathing on their own . They weighed a combined nine pounds nine ounces , with identical dark hair , rosebud mouths , and tiny hearts that beat in perfect synchronicity . Big and thriving , the miracle twins proved so robust that they were sent home after just a week in the neonatal intensive care unit . But for Jade Hope and Erin Faith Buckles , the odyssey had just begun . Kevin and Melissa had never wavered in their belief that the girls should be separated . And so an elite surgical team was assembled : some two dozen specialists , headed by Gary Hartman , M.D. , of the Children 's National Medical Center in nearby Washington , D.C. Preparations would take several months , but Dr. Hartman , a veteran of three previous separation surgeries , felt that Jade and Erin were good candidates for the risky operation . Preparing the girls Dr. Hartman cautioned Kevin and Melissa that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for certain that the girls had no additional life-threatening problems . And while the hearts did appear to be separate , about 60 percent of Erin 's was protruding into Jade 's chest . That meant there might not be room in Erin 's thoracic cavity , cardiologists warned , and she could face additional heart and chest reconstructive surgery down the line . Although the liver would regenerate , splitting it was still risky , because the organ is rich with blood vessels and even a small nick could cause fatal hemorrhaging in an infant . For Kevin and Melissa , just shuttling the babies to and from their frequent hospital appointments was a challenge . The girls could n't fit into a regular car seat , so biomedical engineers had to create a custom model . And there were always dangers to consider . If one baby fell asleep in the car seat and her head were to loll forward , there was a risk she might smother her sister . Melissa would scrunch into the backseat and sit beside the girls , keeping watch during the 40-minute drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically uncomfortable , they also showed signs from the beginning of a deep emotional bond . It was n't unusual to find one twin sleeping with the other 's fingers in her mouth . Awake , they would reach out to stroke the other 's identical face or mischievously steal the pacifier from the other 's mouth . Jade , the mellow one , could doze blissfully through feisty Erin 's crying fits , though sleep was something that eluded their parents . Fearful of infection and wary of gawkers , the family kept to themselves ; the couple never took their fragile daughters out except to go to the hospital . They protected the girls , and their own privacy , but Kevin and Melissa felt lonely and isolated . Surviving surgery The girls were 16 weeks old when Dr. Hartman and his team determined that they were finally ready to be separated . In the week leading up to the surgery , Melissa found herself repeating the same message to her uncomprehending babies : " You need to be brave . You have to be strong . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kevin 's military stoicism . To see them through whatever happened , both leaned on their faith that they were all in God 's hands . But even Kevin 's outward calm showed signs of faltering . One day , he went to his best friend , a trumpeter in the drum and bugle corps , and said , " If things do n't go right , and one or both girls die , I want you to play taps for them . " On the morning of June 19 , Kevin and Melissa kissed their daughters and tearfully watched the operating-room door swing shut . Now all they could do was wait and pray . Two hours after kissing the girls goodbye , not knowing if she would see them alive again , Melissa saw the hospital 's chief of surgery , Kurt Newman , M.D. , come through the waiting-room door . The surgery was n't finished , but Dr. Newman was beaming . " You now have two babies that are separate , and they 're both doing well , " he said . Grateful tears filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cried . " Thank you so much . " Life on their own Each baby now had more than 100 stitches and a vertical scar down her middle , but the girls recovered quickly . Released from the hospital after just 13 days , the twins had to adjust to living as singles . " At first , they screamed when we put them in the bathtub , like they were dying , " Melissa recalled . ( When the twins were conjoined , only sponge baths were possible . ) " Now they love it . They splash and kick . " Just going outside to enjoy a sunny day with her twins seems like a precious gift to Melissa . " We went for a long walk , " she reported happily one afternoon . " Then we blew bubbles out back . " But for every exhilarating peak on this emotional roller coaster , Melissa has also experienced a downward spiral , realizing that bringing these special babies into the world also means a lifetime of challenges that could not be foreseen . Immediately after the surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both physically and emotionally . During the surgery , Erin 's heart had been tucked back into her chest , far enough that surgeons are now hopeful she will naturally accommodate it as she grows , without additional surgery . But that good news had been followed by a disturbing discovery : Erin 's legs were no longer moving . At first , doctors had thought her paralysis might be temporary , the result of nerves severed during surgery . But an MRI later showed that Erin 's spinal cord had narrowed , and it 's now possible that the damage may be permanent . Although no monitors or alarms detected anything during the surgery , doctors believe Erin may have suffered something akin to a heart attack or a stroke . In December , an encouraging sign gave Kevin and Melissa some hope : Erin began to have movement in her toes . The couple hopes that stem cell research may even allow her to walk someday . Meantime , the girls continue to grow . The scars on their tiny bodies are just slender threads of pale pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't even be visible . " They 're still going to need some limits if they 're drawn to sports , " Kevin says . Protective plates would have to shield their chests . There are no protective shields for their parents ' hearts as the couple inch their way down an uncharted path , celebrating the milestones , coping with the disappointments , and always , it seems , facing new challenges . But Melissa insists that even if they had known everything that lay ahead back when the sonogram first revealed two tiny bodies fused as one , she and Kevin would have done everything exactly the same . " We would n't have changed a thing . We have two beautiful little girls who are very happy and very healthy , except for Erin 's spinal issues . Erin laughs , she smiles . We 're just incredibly grateful to have them .
