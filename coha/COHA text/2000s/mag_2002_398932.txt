IT 'LL TAKE MORE THAN ROAD RASH AND ROUGH TERRAIN TO KEEP TROOP 648 FROM PEDALING THE DESERT . Photograph // First Class Scout Yukio Maeda braked fast to avoid the bike slowing in front of him . Too late . He lost control and fell hard on the unforgiving blacktop . It took some gentle coaxing to get the sixth grader going again , some convincing that his wounds were not life-threatening . Looking more embarrassed than seriously hurt , Yukio clipped on his helmet and climbed back on his mountain bike . He wearily took his place in line again , leaving more room in front this time , and found a comfortable pace . His bloody knee pumped up and down in a regular rhythm . The desert does that to people-makes them question themselves , their competence . Yet , that was exactly why the 17 Scouts from Rancho Penasquitos , Calif. , Troop 648 came to the Mojave Desert . It was time for the 50-miler requirement of the Cycling merit badge . They had taken shorter rides around their hometown . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last February in Death Valley . Wait Just a Minute It took more than 10 hours to drive from home near San Diego to Death Valley 's far northern edge . After camping at Mesquite Spring , they arose to ride the 50 miles to Furnace Creek . Just before they set out , a ranger driving a National Park Humvee pulled up and asked a simple question : Were they crazy ? The Scouts chuckled as Scoutmaster Ron Lawrence told the ranger of their safety **27;899;TOOLONG safety jackets , two support vehicles for warning what little traffic they expected , gallons of water and more . As the Scouts watched and listened , Scout Chris Barrett said , laughing , " Looks like Mr. Lawrence is busted . " Soon enough , though , the ranger gave his conditional blessing , and the troop began its long trek southward . Peaceful , Easy Feeling The desert floor sloped . To the riders ' left , the Grapevine Mountains were hard up against the road . To their right , farther away , the majestic Panamint Range stood purplish and barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to take them into a nearly lifeless , otherworldly place . And they were loving it . " What a great view , " said Chris . " And the best part : no stop signs ! " The Scouts spread out in three groups , each a single-file line hewing close to the right edge of the road . They settled into a steady , swift pace . Some chose to bunch up close , like racers drafting each other in a road race . Though Troop 648 had amassed hundreds of riding miles , they were still short on pack-riding experience . Two miles into the ride , someone hit the brakes without a hand signal or verbal warning . And Yukio was following too close . Chalk one up for the desert . Confidence Is Key There was some irony in Yukio 's early troubles . The night before , while other Scouts joked around a campfire and read aloud scary stories , he alone voiced reservations about what they were about to do . " Those hills are going to be tough , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident that every Scout would make it to the end . " It 's a group effort , " he said , " and I think we can do it . " But now that they were really doing it , eating up mile after mile of desert hardtop , the first of several steep climbs sucked out some of their confidence . Smiles and joking gave way to reddening faces and labored breaths . First Class Scout Alex Preisser had the right kind of bike for the task . It was a 12-speed road bike , lighter than the mountain bikes some guys , like Yukio , pedaled . But even Alex was huffing on the upgrades . " Riding a bicycle uphill is like eating broccoli , " Alex cracked . " I do n't like to do it , but I 'll do it . " How Yuh Doin ' ? The troop nearly came to a standstill on one especially pitched segment of road . A few Scouts found themselves walking their heavy machines up the last section . Luckily , the majority of the first half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troop 648 had already put more than 20 miles behind them . Photograph Scout Jared Firestone and the rest of Troop 648 were determined to make it through Death Valley alive , even if that meant taking a few unscheduled rest stops along the way . Photograph LEARN THE LINGO Here are a few key words you can use when striking up a conversation with a diehard cyclist : * Amateur mark : Chain ring grease on a newbie rider 's calf . * Farmer 's tan : A dedicated cyclist 's white thighs and upper body , brown arms and lower legs . Granny gear : The small , third chain ring for pedaling uphill at a speed slower than Grandma and her walker . * Road rash : Result of skin hitting road . ( Some cyclists use a steel bristle brush to remove pebbles stuck in their rash. ) * Shin hawk : Tufts of leg hair after a bad shave . ( Hair can promote road rash infections. ) * Snakebite : Twin punctures in an inner tube after hitting a curb or rock . * Wheelsucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . // It was time for a quick lunch . They stopped under the impressive sight of a massive alluvial fan , a formation of rock debris created when a mountain stream , loaded with sediment , rushed through Death Valley and spilled out onto the desert floor . As the guys inhaled high-energy food bars , Scoutmaster Lawrence asked how they were holding up under the pace . Yukio made his view clear . The injured cyclist said he did n't like how fast the troop was pursuing its goal . He sounded downright discouraged , not sure he could make another three miles , let alone the more than 30 to Furnace Creek . His unbandaged knee was looking crusty . If the groups of encouragement had any effect on Yukio , it did n't show right away . But after the troop struck its shelter , Yukio took his place in line . When asked what was on his mind , Yukio said grimly , " I 'm thinking about how far we have to go and how long it will take to get there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to sea level , toward the lowest elevations of Death Valley , Yukio gradually worked himself into a more positive state of mind . He got more encouragement from his fellow Scouts . As Dan had said , Troop 648 was determined to get all 17 Scouts to the finish . Photograph LIFE AFTER DEATH Death Valley , in southeastern California , is the largest national park in the lower 48 states . It features amazing rock formations , volcanic craters , huge sand dunes and a wide variety of hardy wildlife But the place is probably best known for its weather . It 's often the hottest point in the country , with temperatures soaring over 120 degrees F. in summer . Troop 648 knew enough to challenge the desert in winter , when temperatures during the day are mild . Still , even then the valley ii not taine . At night , the mercury can plunge below freezing . Conditions can change rapidly , as the Scouts discovered . The day after their epic 50-mile trek , they awoke to swirling sand and winds gusting to 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't light , and more cycling was out of the question . " That 's Death Valley , " a ranger told them . For park information : ( 760 ) 786-2331 ; www.nps.gov/deva // After another brief rest , Yukio seemed like a new man . When asked his thoughts , this time he spoke of fun things the guys would do when they reached their destination . Now , the cyclist who a half-hour earlier had appeared the most likely to drop out looked like the troop strongman . As the Funeral Mountains appeared on the left and the distant snow-capped Telescope Peak came into view on the right , Yukio seemed to sense that they were nearing Furnace Creek . He picked up his pace . He even started passing his troop mates . " It 's like I have more confidence , " Yukio muttered , legs pumping faster and faster . With just a few miles to go , he was nearly at the front of the entire line of cyclists . At trek 's end , they had all made it , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Troop 648 . <p>
