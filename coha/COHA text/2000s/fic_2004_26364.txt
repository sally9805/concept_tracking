Pasadena , California January Early Tuesday morning Lacey Quinn looked around her parents ' gracefully remodeled old Pasadena home and gave herself a moment to prepare for the coming storm . Her mother and father were enjoying a sun-dappled weekend brunch in the garden room . Lacey had driven over from the coast and dropped in without warning , figuring it would be easier to tell them that way . Now she was n't so sure . " Remember that art auction benefit for the Friends of Moreno County I mentioned last time I was here ? " Lacey asked . Her mother made a noise that said she was listening despite the boring subject . Although charity benefits were Dottie Quinn 's meat and drink , her daughter 's relentless interest in art baffled Dottie as much as it irritated her . Except at the very high end of the trade , art was indelibly messy ; she preferred life well ordered and tasteful . " What about it ? " her father asked . Part of Lacey wanted to drop the subject . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing two of her paintings for a showing , Susa Donovan is going to paint a canvas onstage and then auction it off right there , with the money going to Friends of Moreno County . " Coward , sneered her inner self . You did n't driveall the way from the beach just to announce that . Brody Quinn grunted , shuffled the legal papers he was reading , and said , " That 's nice . " " Nice ? " Lacey put her paint-stained hands on her equally paint-stained jeans . " Dad , even postcard-size paintings by La Susa sell for more than a quarter of a million a canvas . " " So she gets a nice write-off giving one to charity , " Brody said . " So what ? " " In addition to donating the painting , " Lacey said through her teeth , " she has generously agreed to look at any old paintings people bring in . Sort of like Antiques Roadshow . " " Clever idea , " Dottie said instantly . " Everyone is sure they have a treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a huge turnout and lots of press for the event . Excellent approach . I 'll put it to work for my next charity auction . I 'll even use the name of your little shop , Lost Treasures Found . " Lacey managed not to wince . Her shop was n't huge , but it kept her and her partner , Shayla Carlyle , employed and paying taxes while they scoured estate sales and craft fairs both local and distant for stock . Figuring the conversation no longer needed to include him , Brody went back to the legal brief he was reading . " The point is , " Lacey started , when she got distracted by a lock of her curly hair springing free of the clip she used to tame the chestnut mass . " Damn ! " Automatically she jammed curls back in place and reset the clip . " If you 'd just have it cut short and styled , dear , it would be easier to control , " Dottie said . " Then I 'd have to do it every few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it only costs twenty dollars a painting to have Susa look at them . " Dottie adjusted to the changed subject without a pause . " Even better . All money donated , yes ? " " Yes , and I 'm going to take three paintings in for her to see , " Lacey finished in a rush . " I 'm sure she 'll be quite kind to you , " Dottie said . " After all , she has family of her own , I believe . Did n't High Style magazine mention six children and various grandchildren ? " " Not my own paintings , " Lacey said , setting her teeth . " Granddad 's . " A legal brief slammed down on the patio table as Brody stood up . The family cat shot out from under Brody 's chair and vanished into the lush undergrowth of the garden . " All over again , " Brody said . " From the beginning . " Lacey 's chin came up . " You have a good legal mind . Do I really need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is convince me that I should n't - " " Not again , Dad . We 've had this argument so many times we could speak each other 's lines . For whatever reasons , you think your father 's paintings are n't worth wall space . I do . I think he is - was - " She swallowed . His death two years ago was still fresh for her , still hurtful . Sometimes she still thought she saw him from the corner of her eye or across the street or turning down the aisle of the grocery store . " Grandfather was a very fine artist , equal to if not better than any of the California Plein Air Impressionists that are hanging in museums on both coasts . I believe in him . He believed in me . " " Honey , I 'm sure your father - " Dottie began . Lacey kept talking . " Without my grandfather I 'd be trying to be something I 'm not , a society woman instead of an artist . I do n't ask you to support my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't act like I need your permission , either . He left the paintings to me , not you . He died before I understood how much he meant to me . The least I can do is try to resurrect him from undeserved anonymity as an artist . " " Still dying to do David Quinn : Biography of an Unknown Artist ? " Brody asked . " I want to know where I came from . I love my family , but I do n't fit in . My sisters do . " She grinned wryly at her mother . " Two out of three ai n't bad , right ? " " Lacey , " her mother said , hugging her . " We love you . " " And I love both of you , " she said , returning the hug . " But that does n't mean we 're the same kind of people . The older I get , the more like myself I get and the less like either of you . Grandpa Rainbow understood that . He understood me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I want the world to understand how great he really was ... ( Continues ... )
