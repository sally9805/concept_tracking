Follow <br> Once a year there was a knock at the door . Two times , then nothing . No one else heard , only me . Even when I was a baby in my cradle . My mother did n't hear . My father did n't hear . My sisters continued sleeping . But the cat looked up . <br> When I was old enough I opened the door . There she was . A lady wearing a gray coat . She had a branch from a hawthorn tree , the one that grew outside my window . She spoke , but I did n't know her language . A big wind had come up and the door slammed shut . When I opened it again , she was gone . <br> But I knew what she wanted . <br> Me . <br> The one word I 'd understood was daughter . <br> I asked my mother to tell me about the day I was born . She could n't remember . I asked my father . He had no idea . My sisters were too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray lady next came , I asked the same question . I could tell from the look on her face . She knew the answer . She went down to the marsh , where the tall reeds grew , where the river began . I ran to keep up . She slipped into the water , all gray and murky . She waited for me to follow . I did n't think twice . I took off my boots . The water was cold . I went under fast . <br> It was April in New York City and from the window of their room at the Plaza Hotel everything looked bright and green . The Story sisters were sharing a room on the evening of their grandparents ' fiftieth anniversary party . Their mother trusted them completely . They were not the sort of teenagers who would steal from the minibar only to wind up drunk in the hallway , sprawled out on the carpet or nodding off in a doorway , embarrassing themselves and their families . They would never hang out the window to wave away cigarette smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were diligent , beautiful girls , well behaved , thoughtful . Most people were charmed to discover that the girls had a private , shared language . It was lovely to hear , musical . When they spoke to each other , they sounded like birds . <br> The eldest girl was Elisabeth , called Elv , now fifteen . Meg was only a year younger , and Claire had just turned twelve . Each had long dark hair and pale eyes , a startling combination . Elv was a disciplined dancer , the most beautiful in many people 's opinions , the one who had invented the Story sisters ' secret world . Meg was a great reader and was never without a book ; while walking to school she often had one open in her hands , so engrossed she would sometimes trip while navigating familiar streets . Claire was diligent , kindhearted , never one to shirk chores . Her bed was made before her sisters opened their sleepy eyes . She raked the lawn and watered the garden and always went to sleep on time . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proud to claim as their own . But when the girls ' mother came upon them chattering away in that language no one else could understand , when she spied maps and graphs that meant nothing to her , that defined another world , her daughters made her think of clouds , something far away and inaccessible . <br> Annie and the girls ' father had divorced four years earlier , the summer of the gypsy moths when all of the trees in their yard were bare , the leaves chewed by caterpillars . You could hear crunching in the night . You could see silvery cocoon webbing in porch rafters and strung across stop signs . People said there were bound to be hard times ahead for the Storys . Alan was a high school principal , his schedule too full for many visits . He 'd been the one who 'd wanted out of the marriage , and after the split he 'd all but disappeared . At the age of forty-seven , he 'd become a ladies ' man , or maybe it was simply that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . Suddenly he was in demand . There was another woman in the background during the breakup . She 'd quickly been replaced by a second girlfriend the Story sisters had yet to meet . But so far there had been no great disasters despite the divorce and all of the possible minefields that accompanied adolescence . Annie and her daughters still lived in the same house in North Point Harbor , where a big hawthorn tree grew outside the girls ' bedroom window . People said it had been there before Long Island was settled and that it was the oldest tree for miles around . In the summertime much of the Storys ' yard was taken up with a large garden filled with rows of tomato plants . There was a stone birdbath at the center and a latticework trellis that was heavy with climbing sweet peas and tremulous , prickly cucumber vines . The Story sisters could have had small separate bedrooms on the first floor , but they chose to share the attic . They preferred one another 's company to rooms of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiratorially to each other in that secret vocabulary of theirs , she felt left out in some deep , hurtful way . Her oldest girl sat up in the hawthorn tree late at night ; she said she was looking at stars , but she was there even on cloudy nights , her black hair even blacker against the sky . Annie was certain that people who said daughters were easy had never had girls of their own . <br> Today the Story sisters were all in blue . Teal and azure and sapphire . They liked to wear similar clothes and confuse people as to who was who . Usually they wore jeans and T-shirts , but this was a special occasion . They adored their grandmother Natalia , whom they called Ama , a name Elv had bestowed upon her as a toddler . Their ama was Russian and elegant and wonderful . She 'd fallen in love with their grandfather in France . Although the Rosens lived on Eighty- ninth Street , they kept their apartment where Natalia had lived as a young woman in the Marais district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as far as the Story sisters were concerned , it was the most wonderful spot in the world . <br> Annie and the girls visited once a year . They were infatuated with Paris . They had dreams of long days filled with creamy light and meals that lasted long into the hazy blur of evening . They loved French ice cream and the glasses of blue-white milk . They studied beautiful women and tried to imitate the way they walked , the way they tied their scarves so prettily . They always traveled to France for spring vacation . The chestnut tree in the courtyard was in bloom then , with its scented white flowers . <br> The Plaza was probably the second-best place in the world . Annie went to the girls ' room to find her daughters clustered around the window , gazing at the horse-drawn carriages down below . From a certain point of view the sisters looked like women , tall and beautiful and poised , but they were still children in many ways , the younger girls especially . Meg said that when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriages . She would wear a white dress and carry a hundred roses . The girls ' secret world was called Arnelle . Arnish for rose was minta . It was the single word Annie understood . Alana me sora minta , Meg was saying . Roses wherever you looked . <br> " How can you think about that now ? " Elv gestured out the window . She was easily outraged and hated mistreatment of any sort . " Those carriage horses are malnourished , " she informed her sister . <br> Elv had always been an animal fanatic . Years ago she 'd found a rabbit , mortally wounded by a lawn mower 's blades , left to bleed to death in the velvety grass of the Weinsteins ' lawn . She 'd tried her best to nurse it to health , but in the end the rabbit had died in a shoebox , covered up with a doll 's blanket . Afterward she and Meg and Claire had held a funeral , burying the shoebox beneath the back porch , but Elv had been inconsolable . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , she 'd whispered to her sisters , then who will ? She tried to do exactly that . She left out seeds for the mourning doves , opened cans of tuna fish for stray cats , set out packets of sugar for the garden moths . She had begged for a dog , but her mother had neither the time nor the patience for a pet . Annie was n't about to disrupt their home life . She had no desire to add another personality to the mix , not even that of a terrier or a spaniel . <br> Elv was wearing the darkest of the dresses , a deep sapphire , the one her sisters coveted . They wanted to be everything she was and traipsed after her faithfully . The younger girls were rapt as she ranted on about the carriage horses . " They 're made to ride around without food or water all day long . They 're worked until they 're nothing but skin and bones . " <br> " Skin and bones " was a favorite phrase of Elv 's . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had created was a faery realm where women had wings and it was possible to read thoughts . Arnelle was everything the human world was not . Speech was unnecessary , treachery out of the question . It was a world where no one could take you by surprise or tell you a mouthful of lies . You could see someone 's heart through his chest and know if he was a goblin , a mortal , or a true hero . You could divine a word 's essence by a halo of color  --  red was false , white was true , yellow was the foulest of lies . There were no ropes to tie you , no iron bars , no stale bread , no one to shut and lock the door . <br> Elv had begun to whisper Arnelle stories to her sisters during the bad summer when she was eleven . It was hot that August ; the grass had turned brown . In other years summer had been Elv 's favorite season  --  no school , long days , the bay only a bicycle ride away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all she 'd wanted was to lock herself away with her sisters . They hid in their mother 's garden , beneath the trailing pea vines . The tomato plants were veiled by a glinting canopy of bottle-green leaves . The younger girls were eight and ten . They did n't know there were demons on earth , and Elv did n't have the heart to tell them . She brushed the leaves out of her sisters ' hair . She would never let anyone hurt them . The worst had already happened , and she was still alive . She could n't even say the words <br> for what had happened , not even to Claire , who 'd been with her that day , who 'd managed to get away because Elv had implored her to run . <br> When she first started to tell her sisters stories , she asked for them to close their eyes and pretend they were in the otherworld . It was easy , she said . Just let go of this world . They 'd been stolen by mortals , she whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their magic by the charms humans used against faeries : bread , metal , rope . The younger girls did n't complain when their clothes became dusted with dark earth as they lay in the garden , although Meg , always so tidy , stood in the shower afterward and soaped herself clean . In the real world , Elv confided , there were pins , spindles , beasts , fur , claws . It was a fairy tale in reverse . The good and the kind lived in the otherworld , down twisted lanes , in the woods where trout lilies grew . True evil could be found walking down Nightingale Lane . That 's where it happened . <br> They were coming home from the bay . Meg had been sick so she 'd stayed home . It was just the two of them . When the man in the car told Claire to get in the backseat , she did . She recognized him from school . He was one of the teachers . She was wearing her bathing suit . It was about to rain and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started driving away before her sister got into the car . Elv ran alongside and banged on the car door , yelling for him to let her sister out . He stopped long enough to grab her and drag her inside , too . He stepped on the gas , still holding on to Elv . " Reunina lee , " Elv said . It was the first time she spoke Arnish . The words came to her as if by magic . By magic , Claire understood . I came to rescue you . <br> At the next stop sign , Claire opened the door and ran . <br> Arnelle was so deep under the ground you had to descend more than a thousand steps . There were three sisters there , Elv had told Claire . They were beautiful and loyal , with pale eyes and long , black hair . <br> " Like us , " Claire always said , delighted . <br> If they concentrated , if they closed their eyes , they could always find their way back to the otherworld . It was beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in Paris . Two doorways no one else could get past . No one could hurt you there or tear you into pieces . No one could put a curse on you or lock you away . Once you went down the underground stairs and went through the gate there were roses even when snow fell in the real world , when the drifts were three feet deep . <br> Most people were seized by the urgency of Elv 's stories , and her sisters were no exception . At school , classmates gathered round her at lunchtime . She never spoke about Arnelle to anyone but her dear sisters , but that did n't mean she did n't have stories to tell . For her school friends she had tales of life on earth , stories of demons she did n't want her sisters to hear . A demon usually said three words to put a curse on you . He cut you three times with a knife . Elv could see what the rest of them never could . She had " the sight , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ math classes . She scared the hell out of some of them and told others exactly what they wanted to hear . Even in Paris when she went to visit her grandparents , the city was filled with demons . They prowled the streets and watched you as you slept . They came in through the window like black insects drawn to the light . They put a hand over your mouth , kept your head under water if you screamed . They came to get you if you ever dared tell and turned you to ash with one touch . <br> Each day , the number of girls who gathered around Elv in the cafeteria increased . They circled around to hear her intoxicating tales , told with utter conviction . Demons wore black coats and thick- soled boots . The worst sort of goblin was the kind that could eat you alive . Just a kiss , miss . Just a bite . <br> Continues ...
