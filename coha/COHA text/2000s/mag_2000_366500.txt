 --  BASEBALL The major league version will be wildly popular but just in New York City , Los Angeles , Houston and Phoenix , Ariz . The rest of the teams will have folded long before the end of the century , and only these four megalopolises will have the population base , and thus the cash , to support utility infielders making $100 million a year . The minor leagues will flourish too , in such cities as Toronto and Seattle , where ancient ballparks like the Skydome and Safeco Field will allow fans to remember simpler times , when the game was pure and hitters actually had to run the bases , back before the advent of designated feet . <P>  --  FOOTBALL Doomed . By mid-century , selective breeding will have produced 450-lb. linebackers who can run the 40 in 3.5 . When they collide with 420-lb. running backs who can do it in 3.3 , the resulting explosions will be so gruesome that even the guy with the JOHN 3:16 sign will stop attending games . <P>  --  BASKETBALL Utterly internationalized . The Lagos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will dominate . <P>  --  BOXING Following the retirement of Don King , the sweet science will enjoy a soul-stirring comeback , a Periclean Age of noble warriors who fight monthly , only against worthy opponents and always on free television . At weigh-ins , the combatants salute each other by reciting , from memory , quatrains about sportsmanship by Grantland Rice . <P>  --  THE OLYMPICS Replaced by the AOL-Time **33;10859;TOOLONG Republic of China Inc .
