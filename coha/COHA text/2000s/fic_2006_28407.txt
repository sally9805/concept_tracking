The Silver Rose By Susan Carroll Random House Susan Carroll The storm hovered in the distance , the gathering clouds like a herd of wild gray stallions about to rampage through Port Corsair and steal away the serenity of the summer afternoon . As Miri cantered her pony into the small harbor town , she straightened in the saddle , her nostrils flaring as she scented the air . The storm was one , perhaps two hours away at most by her reckoning . The rocky coast of Faire Isle usually took the brunt of the tempests hurled from the sea , but not even the heart of the small island would be immune to the force of this one . The brisk wind blowing leeward threatened to wreak havoc with her hair , but her pale blond tresses were tightly bound in a braid that fell to the small of her back . Hair so severely confined might have left another woman 's face too harshly exposed , but it only served to emphasize the striking mold of her cheekbones . There was something a little fey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept mostly to herself , more comfortable with the creatures of the forest than she was with her own kind . Tall and thin , she wore a belted , ankle-length gown , the soft gray hue adding to the ethereal illusion that she was a lady who could easily vanish in a puff of mist . Her skirts and petticoats bunched uncomfortably about her knees as she rode astride . The fashion forsidesaddles had never been adopted by the practical women of Faire Isle . Miri would as soon have dispensed with a saddle altogether and donned a comfortable pair of masculine breeches as she had been wont to do as a child . But she feared that she already created enough of a stir when she ventured into town these days . As Miri slowed her pony to a walk , she braced herself for the familiar onslaught of faces peering at her over cottage fences . Some simply stared ; others nodded their heads in uneasy recognition . An apple-cheeked woman weeding her garden ventured to wave , but as Miri went by , the woman immediately turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , but the whispers , the stares thrust her back through the years to another gloom-ridden summer day . . . The drum beat out a relentless tattoo and her heart seemed to thud in tempo as she was dragged toward the town square by the grim-faced witch-hunters in their black robes . The halter they had fastened about her neck abraded her skin raw , but she tried to keep her chin up , remember who she was , the daughter of the brave Chevalier Louis Cheney and the Lady Evangeline , one of the wisest women Faire Isle had ever known . But she shrank from all those staring eyes , the faces of people she 'd believed were friends and neighbors . She was a true daughter of the earth . How could they think that she was a witch who had made an unholy pact with the devil ? Why would anyone want to hurt her ? She twisted her head and directed a pleading glance toward the youngest of the witch-hunters . Although he swallowed hard , his dark eyes growing moist , Simon kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered and thrust the memory back into the dark recesses of her past where it belonged . She was no longer that frightened and bewildered child , but a woman of six and twenty , all too familiar with the ignorance and cruelty to be found in the world . So much had changed in her life since that dark summer day she 'd survived her arrest for witchcraft , except perhaps for one thing . Many still suspected her of practicing sorcery . " Filthy little witch ! " Miri flinched in spite of herself at the shrill cry . She shifted in the saddle , glancing about her for the source of the angry outcry only to realize that the epithet had not been hurled at her . A group of some half-dozen women was clustered near the common well , engaged in a heated conflict . Miri 's first instinct was to ride swiftly on by . She hated altercations of any sort and Ariane had warned Miri when she had returned to Faire Isle six months ago . On the morning they had parted , Ariane had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rich gray eyes worried and solemn . " I know how badly you need to return home , but oh , please be careful , Miri . You were never convicted of treason and witchcraft as Gabrielle and I were . Give them no excuse to do so now . Live quietly on Faire Isle . Remember that even after all this time , our family still has powerful enemies . " Enemies like Catherine de Medici , the dowager queen of France , but far better known as the Dark Queen and a suspected sorceress , and her son , Henry , the present king of France , an irrational and vindictive man . But the enemy uppermost in Ariane 's mind had been the one they did not speak of , the mere mention of his name enough to afford Miri pain . The witch-hunter , Aristide . Just as Miri was no longer that innocent child , Simon was no longer that tenderhearted boy , apprenticed to the terrifying Vachel Le Vis , a fanatical witch-hunter . Over the years Simon had grown into a hardened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-dead master who had first arrested Miri . Hugging Ariane fiercely , Miri had pledged to do her best to heed her advice . " Do nothing to draw undue attention to yourself , dearest . " " I wo n't , Ariane . I swear it . " Recalling that promise , Miri nudged Willow away from the square , trying to blot out the sound of the furious , upraised voices . But out of the corner of her eye , she caught a glimpse of the victim of this wrath , a sandy-haired girl , who looked not much older than fourteen . She clutched the ends of a shawl about her frail shoulders , the cloth a bright weaving of many dyed hues like the biblical Joseph 's coat of many colors . Her freckled face blazed defiance although she held her other hand protectively in front of her abdomen . Miri drew rein , shocked as she realized the reason for the gesture . The girl was heavy with child , her thin frame appearing far too frail to bear the burden swelling beneath her gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleeves shoved up to reveal red , work-roughened arms . Miri recognized Josephine Alain , the local potter 's wife . She advanced toward the girl , shrieking , " Slut ! We 've warned you for the last time . We do n't want you showing your face in our town ever again . " Madame Alain was reinforced by an irate chorus of agreement from her neighbors , only timid little Madame Greves appearing to make an appeal for calm . The girl muttered some furious retort , her face streaked with defiant tears . Madame Alain stepped closer , spluttering more insults , shaking her finger under the girl 's nose . The girl stumbled back a step and struck Madame Alain 's hand away . To Miri 's horror , the woman set upon the pregnant girl , slapping her and pulling her hair . Forgetting all she had promised her sister , Miri scrambled off of Willow . Seizing the pony 's bridle , she peered directly into one of his large soft eyes . " Wait , " she commanded , then raced toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict , the girl had sought refuge at the base of the statue in the square . She curled herself in a protective ball with her multicolored shawl drawn over her head as Madame Alain pummeled her back . The other women crowded about , urging her on , only Madame Greves holding back , wringing her hands in her apron . Miri charged in , shoving women out of her way . She locked her arm about Madame Alain 's neck and hauled her back from the fallen girl . " Stop it , " Miri grated in the woman 's ear . " Have you completely lost your mind ? " Madame Alain grunted , fighting to break free of Miri 's grip . Miri spun the woman about with a strength born of desperation and hurled her away . The woman staggered and landed hard on her rump . Spitting furious curses , she fought her tangled skirts in an effort to rise . Although her heart thudded hard in her chest , Miri stepped in front of the sandy-haired girl , clenching her fists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lays a hand on this child will answer to me . " Josephine Alain regained her feet , ready to launch herself at Miri but she was restrained by two of her neighbors . " Great heaven , Josephine . Do n't you see who that is ? The Cheney woman . " Miri 's name buzzed through the cluster of women , their faces reflecting varying amounts of fear , wariness , and awe . Although Madame Alain shrugged free of the hands restraining her , even she hung back , glaring . Miri found the sudden silence unnerving . She was relieved when Madame Greves found enough courage to come forward to help . Taking the girl gently by the elbow , Madame Greves aided her to her feet . As soon as the girl had regained her balance , she thrust the woman 's hands away . " Leave me alone , damn you . I 'm fine . " Madame Greves 's eyes rounded in shock and she beat a hasty retreat . The girl looked shaken , but otherwise unharmed . Miri blew out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation , she was uncertain what to do next . She was painfully aware of having neither Ariane 's calming aura nor her other sister Gabrielle 's regal manner . She was more disquieted by the prospect of addressing this crowd of hostile women than she had been battling her way through them . Folding her arms defensively in front of herself , she demanded , in what she hoped was an authoritative tone , " Would someone care to explain to me what is going on here ? " " It is no concern of yours , Miribelle Cheney . " Strands of gray hair escaped from Madame Alain 's chignon , the wind blowing them about a face that had once been pretty . Bitterness had soured her visage into a shrewish expression . " I am afraid I must make it my concern , when grown women run mad enough to attack an innocent girl . One moreover who is far gone with child . " " Innocent ? " Madame Alain snorted . " Carole Moreau is nothing but a little whore , spreading her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , are you worried I wo n't leave any for you ? " Carole snapped . " Why , you -- you salope . " Madame Alain lunged at her again , but Miri blocked her path , stopping her with a fierce look . Madame Alain shouted at the girl past Miri 's shoulder . " We have warned you time and again not to come around here , flaunting that bastard growing in your belly before decent women . " " I have as much right to be here as anyone else , " Carole blazed , but her lip quivered . " You ought to stay at home , keep your shame hidden away . " " I would say the shame belongs more to the men who took advantage of such a young girl , " Miri said icily . " Oh , no , Mistress Cheney , " another woman piped up , a buxom blonde . " Carole truly is a wicked creature . Always muttering curses against us . She made my milk curdle the other day . Her eyes radiate pure evil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Miri shook her head at them incredulously . " Since when did the women of Faire Isle start believing in such nonsense as evil eyes ? My God ! I have seen my share of folly and cruelty in the rest of the world . But this island was once a place of refuge , especially for women who met with misunderstanding and abuse elsewhere . We were wont to treat each other with respect . What has happened to your kindness , your compassion ? " Miri appealed to each woman in turn , peering deep into their eyes . Most hung their heads or looked away . Only Madame Alain spoke up . " You have been gone a long time , Miri Cheney . Nothing has gone right for this island since the raids of Le Balafre and his witch-hunters . People from the mainland fear to come here anymore , our trade has fallen off to nothing . My own family has been particularly hard hit , our pottery business failed , and my husband dead of grief , leaving me six children to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sisters for bringing the wrath of that accursed witch-hunter and the French king down upon our heads . " Miri felt the heat rise in her cheeks , but she replied calmly , " My sisters are neither traitors nor witches . I am deeply sorry for your troubles , madame , but if you want to blame anyone , blame me . It was my fault for placing too much faith in the wrong man , for not stopping Le Balafre when I had the chance . " Although Miri despised herself for it , even now she could not think of him as the dreaded Le Balafre , but only as Simon . . . Simon Aristide . " Oh , I do blame you , " Madame Alain said . Although the other women stole wary looks at Miri , and Madame Greves tried to hush her friend , Madame Alain stepped closer . Miri could feel the animosity pouring off the woman like a hot , dark wave . " Though no one else here has the courage to tell you this , you are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are protecting . " " I regret that you feel that way , madame . But Faire Isle is my home as it is Mademoiselle Moreau 's . Neither of us is going anywhere . " Miri met the woman 's glare without flinching . Madame Alain was the first to look away , muttering . " We 'll see about that . " She stalked off across the green , the other women trailing after her . Only Madame Greves lingered . Tugging at her kerchief strings , she gazed earnestly up at Miri . " You must not mind Josephine , milady . She has had a hard time of it and she often says things she does n't mean . " " Madame Alain only said what everyone else is thinking . " " Not everyone . " Madame Greves ventured to touch Miri 's sleeve . " You probably believe that we have all forgotten the good that your family once brought to Faire Isle . But many of us remember the old days and we rejoice to have our lady back amongst us . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not the Lady of Faire Isle . That was my sister , Ariane . " " I know that , my dear . Such a kind and wise woman , the Lady Ariane , a true healer . I pray she might someday be restored to us . But your gift for curing the poor beasts is just as great as hers for helping ailing folk . We have all heard how you brought the Pomfreys ' cow back from the dead . &; Continues ... Excerpted from The Silver Rose by Susan Carroll Excerpted by permission .
