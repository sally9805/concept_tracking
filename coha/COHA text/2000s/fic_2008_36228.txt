Jacob Elliott flipped his left-turn signal on and patiently waited for Mrs. Moyer to pull out of her parking space . He knew it was Mrs. Moyer because her dog , Harold , was frantically clawing at the back window of her station wagon . Jacob Elliott was not especially good at remembering people , but he never forgot a dog . He was debating the merits of this peculiarity when a gleaming , cherry-red sports car zipped around the corner and beat him out of Mrs. Moyer 's spot . <p> The red car door instantly flew open . Two shapely legs extended themselves from the driver 's side , and a delicate blonde emerged . She threw her hands into the air in a gesture of furious exasperation and gave the door a thunderous slam , catching the hem of her swirly pink skirt in the jaws of the powerful machine . She glared at the skirt contemptuously , gave a yank , and tore herself loose  --  leaving half a yard of pink material held hostage by the car . Without even so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists clenched , eyes narrowed , nose defiantly tipped upward . <p> Jacob Elliott sat wide-eyed and slack jawed in disbelief as the glossy blond curls disappeared behind the automatic glass doors . He felt a smile creep into the corners of his mouth and a disturbing rush of heat burn across his belly . He was in love . <p> Life , Amy Klasse fumed , was not fair . You do all the right things , and bam ! You get kicked in the teeth . It made her furious , especially since innocent children were going to be among the hapless victims . <p> Wrenching a wire cart out of the cart stack , she viciously pushed it toward the vegetables . She glared at her shredded skirt . Of all the lousy luck ; now , on top of everything else , she 'd ruined her favorite outfit . Darn that car . And it was n't as if she could afford to buy another pink skirt : She was unemployed . She 'd been unemployed for twenty minutes . She looked at her watch . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . A chicken , for crying out loud ! She muttered a well-chosen expletive and indiscriminately grabbed a grapefruit from a huge display . " A chicken ! " she exclaimed , thunking her fist against her forehead . <p> Jake watched in absolute astonishment as his newfound love flung a grapefruit into her cart and took off in a blind rage . The remaining grapefruits hesitated for a moment in precarious limbo , and then hurled themselves onto the floor like so many lemmings making the final , fatal , migration . Jake stopped a grapefruit with the side of his foot and flipped it into the air , like a soccer ball . He scooped up several more and carefully lined them up in their bin . <p> From the corner of his eye he caught the infuriated blonde heading for the fresh eggs . " Oh , no , " he said , groaning , " not the eggs . " <p> In silent horror , he watched as she chose a carton and in some magical way managed to grasp only the top lid , spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eggs instantly exploded on their companions , oozing across gleaming shelves , sliming into pristine crevices . <p> The blonde stared at the eggs as if they were aliens . She shook her head and muttered something indiscernible while Jake doubled over his own cart in an attempt to abort the laughter that was rising in his throat . <p> In his entire life he 'd never come across a female who was that outraged , that clumsy , and that sexy . She was n't sexy by centerfold standards , but there was definitely something about her that increased his heart rate . He liked the way her short blond curls bounced when she walked . He liked her peaches-and-cream coloring and her wide cornflower blue eyes , and the way she carried her slight frame . And most of all , Jake was intrigued by the intensity of her fury , the way she could muster her pride and walk away from disaster . She was not a woman whose life would be ruined by a broken fingernail . <p> A stockboy appeared with a mop and sponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Amy . " Happens all the time . " <p> Amy nodded numbly . Lord , what a mess . Those eggs were like her life  --  scrambled . She decided she did n't want eggs anyway . Eggs reminded her of chickens ; and you know what chickens do  --  they steal people 's jobs ! <p> She proceeded down the aisles at a much more cautious pace , selecting fixings for a spaghetti dinner . She intended to go home , brew up some of her fantastic spaghetti sauce , and eat until she burst . Then she would sit in front of the TV and make the most of feeling sorry for herself . She hefted a bag of cat litter into her cart and continued on . <p> Jake saw the tear in the bottom of the litter bag . He could have told her . He could have introduced himself and explained that she was leaving a trail of cat litter that wound its way through the bulk-food section and staunchly marched through sanitary products , but he did n't . It was much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granules . <p> Besides , he knew when he would make his move . Calamity Jane did n't have a purse , and there were no pockets that he could see in her bedraggled skirt . His guess was that she 'd gone off in such a huff that she 'd left her money behind . He pursued her at a leisurely pace , selecting a bottle of burgundy to accompany her spaghetti dinner and adding a frozen pie for dessert . <p> He lined up behind his quarry at the checkout , feeling an unsettling surge of affection for her while his anxiety ran amok . What if his plan did n't work ? What if she was married ? She did n't have a ring on her finger , but that was no guarantee . Maybe she lost her ring this morning when she was bathing the baby . <p> <br> Continues ...
