The French countryside is the inspiration for a satisfying summer meal // The Provencal Diet is considered to be one of the most healthful in the world . With its reliance on locally grown fruits , vegetables , earthy grains , legumes and golden olive oil-not to mention a daily glass of wine-it encompasses all the wonderful aspects of its famous parent , the Mediterranean diet . Besides being rich in complex carbohydrates , vitamins , minerals and fiber , this diet , with its generous use of olive oil , is a good source of the monounsatu- rated " good " fat that helps lower " bad " cholesterol levels in the blood . In addition , olive oil is an important source of the antioxidant vitamin E. Of course , the ultimate benefits of the Provencal diet come from being in the south of France . But if that 's not possible , at least we can bring a little slice of Provence to your table this summer .
