Denise Darvall , 25 , had been killed in a car accident . But her heart would get a chance to live on in a history-making procedure . As Dr. CHRISTIAAN BARNARD performed the world 's first successful heart transplant on a human , the world palpitated : <P> In painstaking sequence , Dr. Barnard stitched the donor heart in place . First the left auricle , then the right . He joined the stub of Denise 's aorta to Louis Washkansky 's , her pulmonary artery to his . Finally , the veins . Assistant surgeons removed the catheters from the implant as Barnard worked . Now , almost four hours after the first incision , history 's first transplanted human heart was in place . But it had not been beating since Denise died . Would it work ? Barnard stepped back and ordered electrodes placed on each side of the heart and the current ( 25 watt-seconds ) applied . The heart leaped at the shock and began a swift beat . Dr. Barnard 's heart leaped too . Through his mask , he exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work ! " ... The heart gradually slowed its beat to 100 per minute . ( Surgeon Barnard 's had been a frenetic 140 when he finished the operation . ) <P>  --  TIME , Dec. 15 , 1967
