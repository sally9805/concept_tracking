Chapter One New Orleans - February 29 , 2004 " What are the odds of being born on February 29 ? " Rachel Manning looked at Ashley Gallagher and Jordan Bishop , her two best friends in the world and fellow leap year birthday celebrators . " If you 're the three of us , the chances are one hundred percent , " Ashley answered . Jordan tapped her chin thoughtfully . " When you think about it , the odds of three women remaining friends from the newborn nursery to the present are probably astronomical . We 're legendary , like the Three Musketeers . " " Pop quiz , " Ashley said . " What was your best birthday ? " " You 're such a college girl , " Jordan teased . " Al-though we 're twenty-four today , technically we 've only had six birthdays , so the question does n't put a strain on the memory banks . " " This is the best birthday , " Ashley said . " How cool is it to be here in New Orleans ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . " It 's getting late . We should probably head back . I 'd like to make a toast to us at a cozy hotel bar . " " Aw , Mom , do n't be a party pooper , " Ashley teased . " This is my last carefree night . Tomorrow it 's back to work and classes . For the next two and a half months I have to gird my loins , or whatever you call it , to get ready for finals and graduation . " " Hallelujah . " Jordan grinned . " Better late than never , " Ashley defended herself . " I want to squeeze every last ounce of fun out of tonight . By my calculations , we only have about fifteen minutes left until our birthday is over . And we wo n't have another official one for four more years . " Jordan linked her arms through theirs , urging them forward . " Let 's see what kind of trouble we can get into before we get that birthday drink . " That was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman standing on the sidewalk outside a shop . She was agitated and pointing . " Stop him ! Thief ! Help ! " Rachel 's heart thumped hard against her ribs . Oh , where was that safe hotel bar when you really needed it ? People on the sidewalk parted and she saw a slight figure in a black ski cap and dark clothes running straight toward them . Jordan tugged on their arms , urging them out of the way , which was just fine with Rachel . But if he had a knife or a gun .... Then the thief was directly in front of them and Rachel saw Jordan 's foot slide out . As he went down , something fell from his hand and clattered on the walkway at their feet . Jordan bent and grabbed it . Half a second later the guy was up , shooting them a furious look . Rachel braced herself for his attack . But when a siren sounded , he took off around the corner . " Jordan , " Ashley said , her voice breathless , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste any time . " " Everyone okay ? " Rachel asked . She looked at one then the other of her friends . " Yeah , " Ashley said . " Should n't we do something ? Call the police ? Chase him ? " " He 's long gone . " Jordan was turning the tarnished brass she 'd picked up from side to side . " The only thing we can do is return this . It looks like a lamp , straight out of Aladdin . " Rachel shook her head . " That 's your adventurous streak talking . It looks like a glorified gravy boat to me . But obviously that woman wants it back . " Together , they walked toward the waiting woman . She looked like a Gypsy , dressed all in black with a matching bandanna tied pirate style over her dark brown hair . Jordan held out the recovered object . " Are you all right ? " " Yes . " The woman turned the thing over , examining it . " If this had fallen into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and let out a breath . " I am very grateful . " " It was nothing , " Ashley said . " Jordan 's big feet are always getting in the way . " She grinned when the owner of the big feet in question glared at her . The Gypsy shook her head . " You shall be rewarded for your courage . Wo n't you please come inside ? " " I do n't know about this , you guys , " Rachel said , glancing down at the fog swirling around their feet . It was then she noticed the strange green light glowing inside the shop . " It 's all smoke and mirrors . You need to loosen up and be open to new experiences . Carpe diem . When an opportunity presents itself , seize it with both hands and go along for the ride . " Jordan linked her arms through theirs again and tugged them into the shop . " My name is Faith , " the woman said . She turned , holding the dull , dirty brass thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must rub the lamp and make a wish . " " I told you it was a lamp , " Jordan said . " Is n't the going rate for a good deed three wishes ? " Ashley asked . Jordan made a tsking noise . " No wonder it 's taken you so long to get through college . Do the math . One wish apiece is three wishes . " " And one is all you need if it 's the right one , " the strange woman said . " Okay . But as the story goes , a genie will appear . What do we do then ? One guy ? Three women ? Do we arm wrestle for a date with him ? " Ashley asked . " No genie , " Faith said . " That 's very yesterday . But I promise if you wish for your heart 's desire , you will be rewarded . " Ashley met Rachel 's gaze . " With your track record , it would n't be smart to wish for a man . On the off chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rachel agreed . Every time she 'd let herself care , she lost something . " I do n't want a man , either , " Jordan commented . " Good . " Ashley nodded emphatically . " Let 's do a group rub , " Jordan suggested , taking it from the woman . " We 'll wish for the most outrageous things we can think of . " Together they took the lamp and rested it on their palms . " Feel that ? " Rachel asked uneasily . Warmth seemed to emanate from metal she 'd expected to be cold . " It feels like it 's vibrating . " " You 're just shaking . " Ashley looked at the lamp . " I 'll go first . I wish for money and power . " She glanced up and searched their gazes . " What ? " " That 's two wishes , " Rachel pointed out . " Power is sort of a subset of money . " As Rachel rubbed her index finger along the curved side of the brass , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness opened up inside her producing an almost painful ache . " I wish I had a baby . " She smiled sheepishly at her friends ' shocked expressions . " You would n't let me wish for a man . " " That 's the best outrageous you can do ? " Jordan heaved an exaggerated sigh . " I can top you both . I want to be a princess and live in a palace . " " Oo-kay . " Rachel laughed . " That 's pretty outrageous since you have a better chance of kissing an above average-looking toad than meeting a handsome prince . " ( Continues ... )
