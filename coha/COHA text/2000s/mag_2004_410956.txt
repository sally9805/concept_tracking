Here 's what you 'll be buying-and lusting for-in 2004. // What 's better for your sagging winter motivation than shiny new bikes and parts ? Last October , we spent five days combing the city-sized display floor of the annual Interbike trade show in Las Vegas to bring you a look at the very latest bikes , equipment and trends. - Mark Riedy CARBON FEVER Once the domain of micro-manufacturers like Zipp and Italian craftsmen clever enough to strike up partnerships with performance automotive houses ( such as Colnage and Ferrari ) , carbon fiber is , for the moment , the material of choice in the bike world . The new wave of mid-priced bikes and products comes from Asian factories , which have only recently mastered the fabrication of the rigid , feathery fibers . It 's an incredible change from just a few years ago when French company Time worked to develop a race-ready carbon stem . When it arrived , it was light , at just over 100 grams , but sold for an amazing $250 . This year , you 'll see stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies such as Specialized . You 'll also see bikes as inexpensive as $699 ( Marin 's Venezia ) with carbon rear ends , and scads of lightweight carbon handlebars , stems , seatposts , cranks and wheels ( we liked the True Temper OX Platinum steel and OCLV carbon LeMond Zurich for just $2,420 ) . While there 's no shortage of mid- to low-end carbon frames and components , there 's also a revolution at the ultra-ultra high end . German carbon craftsmen AX-Lightness showed a set of carbon brake calipers on a sub-11-pound Storck carbon bike ; Zipp has a new $2,950 wheelset , the Z2 ; and Campagnolo will be selling a pair of $3,500 carbon clincher wheels this year . Campagnolo was n't the only company showing off carbon clinchers : Reynolds ( which has more than 50,000 all-carbon forks on the road ) , FIR , Gipiemme and FSA also displayed all-carbon-clincher wheelsets . Previously , weight weenies who wanted all-carbon hoops had to turn to tubular rims , so this breakthrough could mean the end of gluing up tires . It 's not vaporwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DV clincher , and Campagnolo plans m to be shipping two Hyperion models by year 's end . PEDAL LIKE A PRO Just a few years ago , off-road riders felt lucky to have lockout on a fork or shock . While helpful on long climbs or fladand sprints , the lockout lever was widely acknowledged to be a stopgap until a more elegant and efficient solution to energy-wasting , pedal-induced suspension bob could be found . In 2002 Specialized introduced the Epic , equipped with the Fox BRAIN shock , which could distinguish between rider input and bump forces . It was a step forward , but it was n't adjustable or predictable enough to be considered an all-purpose solution . Now Fox and Manitou have introduced technologies that wring new life from even the oldest suspension designs . These technologies-Fox 's ProPedal and Manitou 's SPV-minimize shock or fork movement from the slow , rolling inputs generated by a rider 's pedaling action . On the trail , this translates to increased efficiency : A 5-inch-travel ProPedal or SPV bike now pedals with the efficiency of a short-travel bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cannondale , Fisher , Tomac , Jamis , Giant , Trek and almost everyone else , the Manitou Swinger with SPV shock and matching Black fork are a revelation out on the trail . Manitou 's SPV technology turns a sluggish 5-inch rear-travel bike into something you could easily ride all day . The only downside is that , if not properly tuned , SPV can add a slight edge to the initial travel of a shock or fork . You absolutely have to get on an SPV- or ProPedal-equipped bike to truly appreciate the hype . THIS YEAR 'S TRENDY NICHE : TRACK BIKES Singlespeeds , ' cross bikes , cruisers , coffee bikes : Every year there 's a hot category of bike that everyone who already has too many bikes is wildly excited about . For 2004 , it 's the track bike . Loved for its graceful lines and singularity of purpose , the basic form of the track bike has barely changed in a hundred years . With rock-bottom-value bikes from KHS , Fuji and SCMA , a single-gear speedster is within reach of almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are sexy mid-range options from Felt , Bianchi and Cannondale and go-for-broke customs from masters like Oakland 's Albert Eisentraut and Osaka , Japan 's Nagasawa . Bianchi has made the budget-minded Pista for decades , but outdoes itself for 2004 . The $550 steel-framed track bike pops out of the box with a super-shiny chrome chassis . Modernists will become fast friends with Felt 's TK2 track bike . With its multi-shaped aluminum tubes , aero fork , wind-cheating deep-section wheels and an all-black-component package , the Felt looks fast just standing still . OUTBOARD-BEARING BOTTOM BRACKETS By using the same bottom bracket design in its newly redesigned Dura-Ace group that it first displayed in its 2003 XTR kit , Shimano ushers in the era of external-bearing bottom brackets . As BB spindles have grown larger in diameter , bearings have become smaller to fit into a traditional BB shell , making the design of the external-bearing BB ( with bearings in aluminum cups hanging just outside the actual BB shell ) more and more appealing . The external-bearing BB gives you increased stiffness , thanks to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no additional weight . This year will likely see external-bearing bottom brackets from a host of companies including Canadian company RaceFace , Lightning Cycle Dynamics , FSA and Truvativ . RaceFace is introducing the X-Type crank/bottom bracket combo , which will be available in cross-country ( Deus ) , freeride ( Atlas ) and downhill/hucking ( Diabolus ) versions . All RaceFace cranksets will use bearings interchangeable with those from Shimano 's XT , XTR and Saint groups . HUCKIN ' CRAZY Connect the dots between the North Shore of Vancouver , Southern California 's Sheep Hills and London 's urban hucking scene , and you 've got a craze . " It 's the future . Riding to have fun is where it 's at . You do n't have to train every day to enjoy it , " says Brandon Sloan , product manager at Specialized . In this case it 's 26- or 24-inch dirt jumping bikes , in demand by kids who have grown up jumping and trail-riding on 20-inch bikes and are making the transition to 26-inch wheels . The average hucking bike weighs more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame , single-crown 150mm-travel suspension fork ( most often from Marzocchi ) , a single chainring , disc brakes and heavy components . Produced by everyone from Haro and Specialized to Brooklyn Machine Works and Marin , prices for a solid dirt jumper range from between $500 and $2,000 . OVER-THE-TOP BIKES Perhaps taking a lesson from racing lore-attack not when you 're strong but when others are weak-bike companies continue to find success amid the stumbling economy with ever-more-expensive bikes and apparel . Seven 's carbon-and-Ti Elium frame racks in at $3,595 . Italian framebuilder Dario Pegoretti 's Luigino , made with Columbus Nivacrom EL-OS steel , tips the register at $2,400 ( frame and fork ) . Castelli 's new Laser bibs , cut with lasers to eliminate hemming at the edges and padded with the new YPro3 chamois , cost $225 . The news is n't that companies are putting outrageous price tags on their highest-end items ; it 's that they 'll sell every one they make . Which leads us to advise George W : If you want to cure the economy , turn everyone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bike world . // <p>
