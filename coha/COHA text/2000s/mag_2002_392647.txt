The latest generation of portable M players just holds more of it . Leading the way has been Apple 's elegant little iPod ( $299 for SGB ; $399 for 10GB ; $499 for 20GB ) , shown here , which is now compatible with PCs . Larger but in many ways more impressive is Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3 ( $350 ) . Its 20GB hard drive holds about 4,000 songs ; a 40GB model ( $500 ) was released in May . And the Nomad 's analog/digital line-in lets it connect to other audio devices or a microphone to create digital files without using a computer as an intermediary . - ART JANIK 2 The bag Book bags are to students what cars are to many adults : a utilitarian item that 's also a statement of personal style .

The new Spoke model ( $79 ) has a built-in rain flap , a front flap for carrying a bike helmet , a removable cell-phone pocket , two easy-access pockets on the hip belt , and water-bottle holders .

SmartPrice ( www.smartprice.com ; 877-550-5317 ) has a feature that determines which of more than 100 long-distance plans is best for your calling habits . Prepaid calling cards are usually even cheaper . We like the Sam 's Club/AT &T; card ( www.savewithprepaid . com ; 800-530-6744 ) , which costs 3.47 a minute plus a one-time $8.95 fee .
