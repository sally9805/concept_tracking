<p> April 17 : Cade McNown is selected by the Bears with the 12th pick in the draft . <p> You have no control over where you are going to go . Imagine that for yourself . You could end up anywhere in the U.S. It 's hard , really hard . But I am really happy the Bears took me , happy I 'll be playing for one of the charter teams of the NFL , a team with so much tradition , in such a great city . There were a lot of other cities I could have been playing in that my friends from L.A. would n't have been so willing to come out and visit me in . <p> May : McNown moves to Chicago , works with coaches and works out at Halas Hall every day . <p> When you show up , you have to be really focused on the football part , but you have to get everything else in order , too , all the little menial tasks , day in and day out . You really do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless you 're really diligent , your life can fall apart . I do n't know anyone in the area to lean on . <p> I am renting a place 10 or 12 miles north of Halas Hall . The other rookies who are n't sure if they 'll be here are living in a hotel 10 miles south of Halas Hall . I just come here , put in my time , spend a lot of time watching film and then go home . I definitely feel isolated . <p> Right now , it 's every man for himself . Everybody is trying to make the team , and that sentiment goes a lot further than people might think . You would think we 're all a part of the team . But a lot of these guys do n't know . <p> July 21 : McNown receives a contract offer from the Bears two days before training camp is scheduled to begin . <p> The offer is n't even in the ballpark . I wanted to be in camp on time , but at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want you bashing my head against the curb in a year or two because you are n't happy with the contract . When you 're talking about something that you are going to be playing under for five to seven years , you want to make sure it 's done right , even if it 's at the expense of a few days of a holdout . " I trust my agent , Tom Condon , and he 's been through this many times . <p> Aug. 2 : McNown ends his holdout and reports to camp . His contract , a seven-year deal that should void after five years , could be worth up to $ 22 million and includes a $ 6.1 million signing bonus . <p> The holdout was definitely worth it . But it was 11 days I would have had to learn the offense with everybody else . Everything will be pushed back a little bit . You roll with it . <p> Aug. 21 : McNown gets his first start in a preseason game against the Rams at Soldier Field . His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 of 11 attempts for 71 yards and a touchdown . <p> I 'm not discouraged , but starting out with the first couple passes being interceptions stinks . That was n't very good . But I bounced back . <p> Sept. 11 : McNown learns he will play the Bears ' third offensive series in the season opener the next day . He is sent on a doughnut run for the team to pick up seven dozen glazed , two dozen chocolate-iced chocolate , two dozen chocolate long johns , one dozen assorted , one dozen plain , a half-dozen custard-filled , two gallons of chocolate milk , two gallons of whole white milk and one gallon of orange juice . <p> I am happy I am actually being halfway hazed so I can feel I am more a part of the team . I 'm glad to be taking some lumps . I 'm in charge of making sure all the rookies have their appointment to get doughnuts on Saturday mornings . If someone messes up , it 's going to be me who gets yelled at . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way teammates talk to you and do n't respond to you . I try to be a good person and do things like carry bags and open doors for people . Things like that are usually pleasant surprises to people , but when you 're a rookie , it 's expected . <p> Sept. 12 : In his first regular-season game , McNown completes 6 of 9 passes for 77 yards , leading the Bears to a field goal in an upset 20-17 victory over the Chiefs . <p> I was really focused . I did n't care about anything except going out there and playing well . I was n't thinking of the Chiefs . I was n't concerned with coaches . I was n't concerned with anybody . All I was thinking about was doing the best I could , being as competitive as I could . <p> A lot of people have told me what a great job I did . Well , that 's what I 'm supposed to do . It frustrates me when people are excited , almost caught off guard when I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Do n't be surprised if I do what I 'm supposed to do . I expect to do things that will help us win . <p> Oct. 17 : McNown gets his first pro start . He throws his first touchdown pass , an 80-yarder to Marcus Robinson , but also is intercepted twice and sacked four times by the Eagles . He completes 17 of 33 passes for 255 yards in a 20-16 loss at Soldier Field . <p> There were times I felt I was right back in college . There were times I felt like I was still learning . Most of the time I felt pretty good . There 's a really big difference in seeing other people on film and then getting in there and experiencing it yourself . I do n't know if I felt nervousness . Initially , I was n't really firing the ball the way I like to or playing loose . Later in the game , I started zipping the ball . <p> Oct. 24 : In McNown 's second start , at Tampa Bay , he fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unforgivable pass that is thrown late and over the middle . It is his last pass of the day , as he is replaced in the third quarter by Jim Miller in a 6-3 loss . <p> I did n't like the way it felt to get benched . The only other similar experience was my freshman year in college . But they took me out and told me they just wanted me to watch for a little while , and then they put me back in . Then , I got to go back in and redeem myself . I could n't do that now , which was frustrating . After the coaches made the change and I was standing on the sideline , Warren Sapp was motioning and saying something like , " What ? You do n't want to be out here ? You had enough ? " I told him , " I 'll be back . " <p> Nov. 21 : McNown watches Miller light up the Chargers for 357 passing yards as Gary Crowton 's offense begins to receive widespread acclaim . <p> Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great system for quarterbacks . When I first came here to check out the facility before the draft and I met Gary , he said , " I do n't know who we 're going to take , but whoever comes here is going to be successful . " I was laughing , and I said , " That 's fine because wherever I 'm going , I 'm going to be successful . " He 's got the same confidence in his ability to coach that I have in my ability to play . For a while it was taking time to come together . He was hearing things like , " Is this an NFL offense ? " Whenever somebody comes up with a new idea , the first reaction is for people to come up with ideas why it ca n't work . It was frustrating for him , I 'm sure . But he 's still got that belief in himself and his offense . And now it 's starting to click . <p> Dec. 1 : Miller is suspended for the rest of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shane Matthews , who had been No. 3 on the depth chart behind McNown , is given the starting job ahead of McNown . <p> I 'm a little disappointed . The coaches are making what they think is the best decision . I 'm not going to tell them I think something else because it does n't make any difference what I think . Hopefully , in a couple of years , it will make a difference what I think . But for now I 'm a rookie and I 'm not at liberty to offer too many opinions . It just adds more fuel to the fires . I feel the longer I get denied , the longer I 'm going to have a streak of good things happen to me . <p> It is n't easy to learn an offense without being in there . Peyton Manning is a good example of someone who got thrown in there , made a ton of mistakes , learned from them and has gotten better as a result . Peyton is a knowledgeable guy . I talk with him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NFL quarterback . He was prepared for this for so long . A lot of quarterbacks ' fathers are coaches or involved in the game . It 's amazing to me . My dad did n't even want me to play football . I do n't know what he was thinking . But that 's the contrast . I 've always done a lot of stuff without that guidance from a father . There is no bad blood with my father . I do n't consciously not talk to him , but at the same time I do n't seek to talk to him . It 's not like we had a really strong relationship growing up and everything split apart . He 's just always kind of done his own thing . I do n't know him that well . <p> Dec. 5 : The Bears lose to the Packers 35-19 , and Matthews fails to distinguish himself on a wet , windy and cold day at Soldier Field . McNown fails to move the team in one series . <p> It was pretty cold . That was as nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of thick Spandex , long sleeves and a short-sleeve shirt . I did n't have that much on . I could have had another layer on . But you ca n't wear polar fleece when it 's raining because it gets wet and your arms get heavy . <p> You get used to the weather . You ca n't let that be a huge factor . You ca n't use it as an excuse . You just deal with it , be tough about it . You find a way to deliver the ball accurately , keep your feet and do all the things you need to do to perform at a high level . Everybody 's dealing with the same thing . You have to make it work to your favor . I know guys from California schools get reputations , but I prefer to be a football guy more than an L.A. guy . In football , you have to be mentally tough , whether it 's about weather , getting down early in a game , having penalties go against you , getting in bad down-and-distance situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all comes from the same attitude . <p> But the cold is an adjustment for me . I 'm still wearing flip-flops outside . <p> Dec. 8 : McNown is named the starting quarterback for the Bears ' final three games . <p> It 's a little disheartening to be put in there when most people are saying we have no chance of making the playoffs . That 's kind of upsetting . But I quickly forget that when I 'm out on the field . I want to go out there and make everybody wonder why I was n't in there earlier . This is a great opportunity for the coaches to see how much I 've developed . If we prove to ourselves that we are as good a team as we think , we 'll be able to go into the offseason encouraged and excited about getting right back into it . <p> Dec. 14 : McNown plays Santa Claus for a group of kids with brain cancer at an area hotel . <p> I know I was a bad-looking Santa Claus . Too thin . That beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was custom-fitted , either . It was made for a fat dude . Most of the kids were in pretty good condition except for a couple . Big smiles . One kid was older , about 15 or 16 . He was really stiff , could n't bend . They leaned him on me . I had to hold him up . It was kind of tough , sad . Working for this charity had a personal meaning to me because a good friend of mine from high school , Brent Evans , died last year after a battle with brain cancer . He inspired a lot of people with the way he fought it . <p> Dec. 18 : McNown pays the price for being a rookie . <p> Every week a different rookie has to buy doughnuts for the team . It was n't my week to buy the doughnuts , but since I 'm the first-round pick , I 'm still responsible for making sure that some rookie gets the doughnuts . The guy who was supposed to get the doughnuts , who shall remain unnamed , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doughnuts late . So as a result , my locker got trashed by the veterans . Then , after practice , Big Cat ( James Williams ) , Mike Wells and Jim Flanigan , a bunch of big guys , dragged me through the snow and threw snow at me . I knew it was coming . I did n't even put up a fight . I just stuck my tail between my legs . What 's the point ? <p> Dec. 19 : McNown has a breakout game , throwing for 301 yards in a 28-10 victory over the Lions at Soldier Field . Receiver Marcus Robinson catches 11 of McNown 's passes for 170 yards and three touchdowns and is named NFC offensive player of the week . <p> Marcus and I have been clicking all year , and it 's not surprising . All through the preseason , training camp and the first part of the season , I was working more with Marcus because he was a second-team receiver and I was a second-team quarterback . I 've been working with Marcus longer than Bobby Engram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for when he 's coming open , and seeing how his body is positioned . He 's so good that I have to make myself aware that I ca n't fall into a comfort zone of just looking for him . No matter how good the receiver is , you still need to read your coverages and go to where the open guy is based on the defense you 're getting . But if I see he 's getting single coverage and I feel he 's going to beat the guy , I 'll give it to him . <p> Dec. 24 : McNown gets caught up in another doughnut caper . <p> I woke up , called the doughnut place and found out the rookie whose turn it was to pick up the doughnuts had n't picked up the doughnuts . I did n't feel like being dragged through the snow again , so I had to haul it down to the doughnut place . I picked them up , bought all the juice and milk and everything and managed to get to Halas Hall and unload it about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mad . I guess I should have reminded the guy again . <p> Jan. 2 : McNown struggles through a season-ending 20-6 loss to the Bucs , throwing for 196 yards and an interception . <p> After this game , it 's weird . All the reporters are so wrapped up in all the possibilities , the what-ifs about the offseason and next year . That was only my third complete game . I can get better . Everyone else can get better . We 've got a lot of confidence in where this thing is heading . It 's going to be a real exciting offseason . <p> I do n't ever want to have a January off again in my pro career . But since I have this one off , I 'm headed to Los Angeles . I 'm going to try to relax and not do much at all for a couple weeks , then start working out . I 'll go to Atlanta for the Super Bowl festivities and take a couple friends , but I wo n't go to the game . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here when the offseason conditioning program starts in mid-March . That is when things can really start to develop . The rapport I have with Marcus , I 'll be able to develop that further , and develop the same rapport with everyone else . <p> When you 're a rookie , you 're at the same place at the same time with veterans , but you 're feeling totally different . Veterans are preparing all year , working their butts off , to get to the point where you just show up in training camp . You ca n't expect much in a rookie year . You have to keep your eyes and ears open and mouth shut . Just get better . If you can survive it , make some plays and get some people believing in you , that 's a bonus . The thing you do n't want to do as a rookie , especially as a first-round guy , is come in and turn people against you by saying the wrong thing at the wrong time , speaking when you should n't or being an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
