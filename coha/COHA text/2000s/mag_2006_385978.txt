. With twins on the way and a husband , Elvis Costello , who does housework , Diana Krall is n't singing the blues on her new album . Diana Krall may be known for her sultry ballads , but at this moment , her all-consuming passion is the chocolate cake in front of her . " A little bit of chocolate is good for the babies , " says Krall , 41 , as she licks a glob of icing off her fork , " and for the mother 's mood ! " Not that she needs much mood enhancement these days . As the delighted jazz artist reveals , she and her husband , Elvis Costello , are expecting not just one but two babies in December . Her bliss is reflected in her 10th album , From This Moment On , a collection of upbeat , old-time pop standards out Sept. 19 . " I 'm really happy , " says Krall , " and that 's been a difficult thing to say in the last little while . " Krall 's last album , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much sadder time in the life of the two-time Grammy winner who brought jazz back to the pop charts . In her first foray into songwriting ( Costello cowrote six tracks ) , the singer-pianist delved into the pain of losing her mother , Adella , who died in 2002 after a six-year battle with cancer . " Making that record was intense , but it helped me process the emotions , " she says . " I would n't have been able to get here if I had n't gone through all of that . " Helping her to make that journey was Costello , 52 , whom she met in February 2002 at the Grammy Awards  --  just months before her mother 's death  --  and wed in December 2003 She and her husband , says Krall , " share a desire to experience everything in life that we possibly can . He 's the love of my life and he 's just my heart . " The two have spent much of their married life juggling separate touring schedules . " Ten days apart is romantic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Costello , who carries photos of his wife  --  and her songs  --  on his iPod . " But six weeks apart , and you feel like you 're on the planet Jupiter ; it gets so unbearable . " With both of them taking a break before the arrival of the babies , Krall is savoring their time together . Now , she jokes , " I do n't want him to go to the corner store . " The couple have homes in New York City and on Vancouver Island . " I love the energy of Manhattan , but I also need to be in the mountains , " says Krall , a native of British Columbia . In both places Costello brews evening tea for his wife and " loves to do laundry , " she divulges somewhat reluctantly . " And yes , he irons too ! " He 's not the only music icon in her inner circle . Elton John , whose estate outside London was the site of her wedding , is a pal . " I met Elton for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krall recalls . " Within the first five minutes , he looked me up and down and said , " You 're pregnant ! ' ' " And then there 's Tony Bennett , with whom she toured in 2000 Last month in New York , Krall and Costello serenaded him at his 80th-birthday party . In fact , Krall sees Bennett , Sir Elton , Costello and herself as " a bit like the Rat Pack . " The foursome gathered recently at a benefit for Vancouver General Hospital that raised more than $2 million for research into blood-related cancers . " Instead of a somber occasion , " says Krall , who became involved in the cause when her mother was diagnosed with multiple myeloma cancer , " it was like a big party . " For the next three months , it will be a party of two , anticipating the arrival of two special guests . Krall is planning to hunker down with her husband to watch old movies , listen to Bing Crosby records and practice staying up late for those 2 a.m. feedings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither of us do , " says Costello , adding with a laugh , " How do you think we got into this trouble ? " For Krall it 's no trouble at all . " I read this checklist the other day that says I 'm supposed to have , like , 12 onesies , which means I need 24 , " the first-time mom-to-be says with a contented sigh . " What 's a onesie ? What 's a contraction feel like ? I have no clue . It 's overwhelming and sometimes frustrating . But it 's a divine dissatisfaction . " BOX HOUSE MUSIC " The babies hear us singing onstage , and we sing at home together a lot ; they hear us , sure ! " says Krall . So the twins obviously listen to a medley of rock and jazz , plus whatever 's on their folks ' playlists . " People wonder if we fight about what music is playing in the house , " says Costello . But " I 'm the one putting on the Bing Crosby records !
