Chapter One At precisely eight forty-five on the second Monday morning in June , Hannah Swensen took a number from the deli-style dispenser mounted on a pole next to the secretary 's desk and plunked herself down in one of the nondescript chairs in the nondescript waiting room to wait her turn . It was hot and muggy , standard fare for this time of year . While other states boasted of fish that jumped , living that was easy , and cotton that was high , summertime in Minnesota was just the opposite . The muggy heat caused fish to lurk at the bottom of the lake , totally unmoved by even the tastiest bait , and the living was far from easy , especially if you owned a family farm . The corn might be knee high by the Fourth of July , if it was a good year , but the only thing that was high in the second week of June was the humidity . A low rumble made Hannah frown . She hoped the sound came from one of the big trucks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from gathering storm clouds . This was the first day of the Tri-County Fair and the gates opened at noon . The coming week would be like a holiday , with hundreds passing through the turnstiles to look at the exhibits , enjoy the rides on the midway , and attend the rodeo that was held every afternoon . Hannah brushed several orange cat hairs from her tan slacks . They landed on the seat of the orange plastic chair next to her . Although she vacuumed every weekend , it was a losing battle . Her orange and white tomcat , Moishe , contributed twice as much hair as she collected in the bag of her vacuum . There were times when Hannah seriously considered installing an orange and white carpet , buying orange and white furniture , and eating only orange and white food during the shedding season . It would n't cut down on the cat hair , but it would be camouflaged . At least she would n't be aware of how many strands she was walking on , sitting on , and ingesting . This type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the cat hairs had landed . But spending more time in a chair like this was something to be avoided . It was a clone to every other molded plastic chair in every other waiting room in the state . Perhaps it was true that form followed function , but in this case it was horribly uncomfortable and as ugly as sin . Rather than glance at her watch for the third time in as many minutes , Hannah thought about why so many businesses bought these chairs for their waiting rooms . The plastic was impervious to spills and scratches , and they did add a splash of color to an otherwise drab room . The chairs were bolted to rails that conjoined them as sextuplets . Hannah supposed that this was meant to discourage theft , but she seriously doubted that anyone would want to steal them anyway . Sitting up straight did n't help to relieve the strain on her back , so Hannah tried slouching . That was even worse . A little notice stamped on the back of the chair in front of her said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that brought up another question . Was anybody truly average ? Average was a statistical tool that took tall people over six feet , added them to short people under five feet , and came up with an average of five and a half feet . Hannah knew from bitter experience not to buy slacks marked average . They were too short for tall people and too long for short people . Perhaps somewhere there might be a handful of people the slacks would fit , but Hannah had never met them . And if these chairs were designed for an average body , it was clear that the model the manufacturer had used bore little resemblance to Hannah . Looking around her , Hannah suspected that she was n't alone . Everyone who was waiting to see the secretary at the Tri-County Fairgrounds looked just as uncomfortable as she did . " Swensen ? " the secretary called out , and Hannah walked over to take the seat in front of the secretary 's desk that had been recently vacated by a man in work clothes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can issue your pass . " Hannah waited while the woman opened a drawer and pulled out a book of bound and printed forms . She flipped it open , retrieved her pen , and looked up at Hannah . " Your full name please ? " " Hannah Louise Swensen . " " Marital status ? " " Single . " " Age ? " " Thirty . " Hannah gave a little sigh . This was June and her thirty-first birthday was in July . When did a woman become a spinster ? Had it happened last year when she hit thirty ? Or would the women 's movement grant her a reprieve so she would n't enter the old maid 's category until she reached forty ? This was a question she could ponder by herself , but she certainly would n't discuss it with her mother ! Delores Swensen was n't reticent about reminding her eldest daughter that her biological clock was ticking . " Street address ? " " Forty-six thirty-seven Maytime Lane , " Hannah replied , smiling a bit as she gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinster but she owned her own home and business . " City and state ? " " Lake Eden , Minnesota . " " And your reason for applying for a pass ? " As usual , she 'd probably bit off more than she could chew . But what else could she have done when Pam Baxter , the Jordan High Home Economics teacher , had called her in a panic at six o'clock this morning to say that Edna Ferguson had been taken to Lake Eden Memorial Hospital for an emergency appendectomy ? Pam had practically begged Hannah to fill in on the judging panel , and of course she 'd agreed . " I 'm a last-minute replacement on the panel to judge the baked goods at the Creative Arts Building , " she said . " Lucky you ! " The secretary looked up with a smile that instantly humanized her . " Really ? " " You 'd better believe it ! That 's a job I would n't mind having . I love desserts and I need to lose a few pounds . " Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest because you need to lose a few pounds ? " " That 's right . My aunt lost thirty pounds when she took a job at a chocolate factory . They let her eat all the candy she wanted , and after the first couple of days , she stopped eating it . She 's been retired for ten years , and she still ca n't stand the sight of chocolate . " " That would n't work for me , " Hannah told her . " How do you know ? " " I own a bakery and I still love desserts . " The secretary sighed as she handed Hannah her pass . " It probably would n't work for me , either . Say ... is your bakery called The Cookie Jar ? " " That 's right . " " Then I 'm almost positive you 're going to win blue ! " " Blue ? " " A blue ribbon . I do n't mean you personally , but the man who took your picture for the photography exhibit . I saw it last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * Less than five minutes later , Hannah was staring at the entry that the secretary thought would take first place in the photography exhibit . It was a candid picture , she had n't even realized it was being taken , and it was undoubtedly the most flattering photo anyone had ever taken of her . Hannah felt the smile begin in her mind , spread out to her face , and flow right on down to the soles of her feet . She felt as if she were smiling all over as she gazed at the photo . It was a wonderful picture , and she could hardly believe that she was the subject ! First of all , her hair was n't sticking up in wiry curls the way it usually did , and it looked more auburn than red . And if that were n't enough to please her , she appeared at least ten pounds thinner than she actually was . Both of her eyes were open , her pose was n't awkward or contrived , and the half-smile on her lips was intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Any photographer who could make her look good deserved a blue ribbon and then some ! Norman Rhodes had taken it , of course . Hannah 's sometimes boyfriend divided his time between his vocation of dentistry , his avocation of photography , and his habit of being a prince of a guy Hannah knew she should probably marry . Unfortunately , she could n't seem to do it , even though her mind told her it was the smart choice . She 'd come to the conclusion that she simply was n't ready for marriage , and reminders from her mother about biological clocks should n't force her into walking down the aisle until the time was right for her . Hannah shook herself mentally and glanced at her watch . It was nine-thirty and she had to meet Pam and her teacher 's assistant , Willa Sunquist , at ten . She did n't have time to think about marriage now . She turned her attention back to the photograph . It was huge , two feet by three feet , and Norman had taken it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clearly visible in the mirror behind the counter , and that must be the way the secretary had recognized her . Hannah was standing behind the counter , looking off into the distance , and there was a very loving , almost beatific expression on her face . It was clear she was thinking about someone or something she loved , and Hannah wished she could remember who or what it was . There was a calendar on the wall to the left of the counter , and Hannah noticed the date . Norman had taken this photograph when Ross Barton and his movie crew were in Lake Eden . The clock on the wall told her that it was almost noon , the time when Ross and his crew arrived to have lunch at The Cookie Jar . Hannah guessed she could have been thinking about Ross , her old college friend who 'd turned out to be much more than that . Then there was Mike Kingston . She could have been thinking of Lake Eden 's most eligible bachelor , the best-looking detective in the Winnetka County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile on her face and made her heart race harder in her chest . Or perhaps she 'd been thinking of Norman . While he was n't heart-stopping handsome , he was kind , and sweet , and sexy , and gentle , and ... " Good heavens ! " Hannah exclaimed under her breath . Since she did n't remember why she 'd been smiling , her smile would just have to remain a mystery . She gave one last look and turned to head for the Creative Arts Building , reminding herself that no one knew why the Mona Lisa had been smiling , either . Hannah took a shortcut through the food court , an area with picnic tables that was ringed by food and snack stands . Some of them were getting ready to open , and Hannah stopped in front of a sign that read , DEEP-FRIED CANDY BARS . One glance at the description that was written in smaller type near the bottom of the sign and Hannah 's mouth started to water . The candy bars were impaled on sticks , chilled thoroughly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one used for funnel cakes , and then deep-fried to a golden brown . The booth was called Sinful Pleasures , and that was entirely appropriate . There should have been a warning sign that read , NO REDEEMING NUTRITIONAL MERIT WHATSOEVER , but Hannah doubted that would stop anyone from ordering . The choices of candy bar were varied , and she was in the process of debating the virtues of a Milky Way over a Snickers Bar when she heard a voice calling her name . Hannah turned to see her sister Andrea running toward her across the food court . Her face was pink from exertion , and wisps of blond hair had escaped the elaborate twist she 'd pinned up on the top of her head . She was wearing a perfectly ordinary outfit , light blue slacks with a matching sleeveless blouse , but she still looked like a fashion model . " Amazing , " Hannah muttered under her breath . " Totally amazing . " " What 's amazing ? " Andrea asked , arriving at her side . " You look gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my oldest clothes and my hair 's a mess . " " It does n't matter . You still look gorgeous . " " It 's nice of you to say that , but I do n't have time to talk about that now . I tracked you down because I need your help and I 'm in a real rush . " Andrea stopped and stared as someone opened the shutters on the fried candy bar booth from the inside . " I read about those deep-fried candy bars in the Lake Eden Journal . You 're not going to order one , are you ? " " They 're not really open yet , " Hannah hedged . " None of the food booths open until noon . " " Well , that 's a relief ! " Andrea fanned her face with her hand . " I do n't have to tell you that they 're loaded with calories , and you still have n't lost the weight you put on over Christmas , do I ? " " Absolutely not , " Hannah said . Wild horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorely tempted to come back when the fair officially opened and order one . " Why do you need my help ? " " Let 's sit down and I 'll show you . " Andrea led the way to one of the picnic tables that sat in the shade of a huge elm . She brushed off the top and opened the file folder she was carrying . " Photos for the Mother-Daughter contest ? " Hannah stated the obvious as Andrea laid out four different poses of her and Hannah 's oldest niece , Tracey . " That 's right . Norman dropped them off last night and I ca n't decide which one is the best . I have to turn it in at ten this morning , " Andrea frowned as she glanced at her watch , " and I 've got only twelve minutes to take it to the secretary 's office . " Hannah looked at each photograph in turn . They were all good , but one was a smidgeon better . " This one , " she said , pointing it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads are tilted at exactly the same angle . " " That 's true , " Andrea said , but she did n't look happy . " How about the one on the end ? " " It 's a good picture , but the resemblance is n't as striking . Tracey 's looking straight at the camera , and you 're looking off to the side . " " I know . I noticed that . It 's just ... " Andrea 's voice trailed off , and she gave a little sigh . " It 's just what ? " " My hair looks better in the picture on the end . " " True , but it 's not a beauty pageant . It 's a mother-daughter look-alike contest . " " You 're right , of course . " Andrea gathered up the photos and put them back in the folder . " I 'll use the one you picked . " Hannah 's sisterly radar went on full alert . Something was wrong . Andrea was worried about how she looked , and she 'd mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's wrong with your hair ? " she asked , forgetting to even try to phrase the question tactfully . " I knew it ! " Andrea wailed , and her eyes filled with tears . " You noticed and that means everyone in town will notice . Bill said he could n't see any more , but he must have missed one . " " One what ? " Andrea took a deep breath for courage and then she blurted it out . " A gray hair ! I 'm going gray , Hannah , and I 'm only twenty-six . It 's just awful , especially since Mother is n't even gray yet ! " She would be without the wonders of modern cosmetology , Hannah thought , but she did n't say it . She 'd promised Delores she 'd never tell that an expensive hair color called Raven Wing was partially responsible for her mother 's youthful appearance . Wishing for the wisdom of the Sphinx , or at least that of a clinical psychiatrist , Hannah waded in with both feet . Her goal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little white lie to accomplish it . " Oatmeal , " she said , remembering the extra bag of cookies she was carrying in her large shoulder bag . " What ? " " Mother swears oatmeal prevents aging . She eats it every day . " " I know it 's supposed to be good for your cholesterol , and some people use it for facials . " Andrea looked thoughtful . " Does Mother really believe that it keeps her from going gray ? " " Absolutely . But whatever you do , you ca n't mention it to her . " " Why not ? " " Because we 're not supposed to believe she 's old enough to have gray hair . If we mention it , she 'll take it as an insult . " Andrea thought about that for a moment . " You 're right . I 'll never mention it . " " So are you going to try it ? " Andrea made a face . " I hate oatmeal . Remember how you used to try to trick me into eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of chocolate chips on the top ? " " I remember . And it worked because you always cleaned your bowl . " " You only thought it worked . I ate off the brown sugar and the chocolate chips , and then I gave the bowl to Bruno when you were n't looking . " " You did ? " Hannah was disillusioned . She thought she 'd been so clever in getting her sister to eat oatmeal , and the Swensen family dog had gotten it instead . " Maybe I should n't have told you , " Andrea said , watching the play of emotions that crossed Hannah 's face . (
