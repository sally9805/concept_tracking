Mason Salisbury and his son , Moreau , were hunting by Little Sandy Creek several miles from where the stream ran through town and powered the Salisbury mill . Father and son carried old fowling pieces and had n't brought the dogs ; they were n't hunting so much as talking . Moreau was home from seminary in Cazenovia . He had n't wanted to be a miller , and who could argue with a desire to serve God ? A father , perhaps , but Mason had n't . Moreau left Sandy Creek convinced " there was more in heaven and earth than a grist mill . " Mason had wondered how much " more " resided in seminary . <p> " The Latin and Greek drummed into your head will make you a fine preacher , " said Mason . <p> " I 'm not a good speaker , " said Moreau . <p> " It 'll teach you rhythm . Like the mill . I run sums , Greek , or the words of Shakespeare through my mind . There 's a rhythm to stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Moreau smiled ; more likely the words of Daniel Webster and Senator Seward ran through his father 's mind . Mason was a political man . A talker . His son would be different . He would talk to God . <p> Moreau 's life , if he stayed in Sandy Creek , would be work , family , community . He was the only son of a miller , a Baptist in a congregation where not less than forty people were either Salisburys or married to a Salisbury , the richest man in town was married to a Salisbury , and Uncle Lorenzo Salisbury had a large farm down the Salt Road . Moreau feared his life might run as predictably and slowly as the creek moving over the broken layers of limestone and its hundreds of little falls , as Little Sandy wound through town , collected in the mill pond , and flowed to Lake Ontario . So he went to Cazenovia looking for God . <p> " The way I see it , " said Mason , " we 'll all miss the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " War ? " <p> " Yes , war " <p> Father and son and everybody in town and all the towns in Jefferson and Oswego Counties talked of war . Since the Dred Scott decision when the Supreme Court upheld the Fugitive Slave Act , reaffirming the legality of returning human beings to bondage , Mason felt war was inevitable . <p> " Slavery is an affront to God . " Mason ran his hand down the barrel of a fowling piece that belonged to his father , Reuben , who fought in 1812 , and who , with nine other Salisburys , left Vermont for the New York frontier forty-five years before . <p> " North and South compromised to avoid war , " said Moreau . <p> " That 's no compromise , " said his father , " but a pact with hell . " <p> Moreau knew his father meant what he said . Mason supported the UGRR , the underground railroad for getting runaway slaves to Canada . From here it was eighty miles north and across the St. Lawrence , or a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syracuse to Buffalo and around Niagara Falls , but sometimes tired and frightened men and women came through Sandy Creek , were hidden in the mill among sacks of meal until Mason escorted the fugitives to a lumber boat . Moreau had taken food and clothing into the mill for half-starved men , and once a shivering woman , but he 'd never accompanied a runaway to Canada . <p> Unlike most men in the North Country , Mason Salisbury had seen slavery . He had been south as a young man , and it changed his life . <p> " Tell about New York and Washington , " Moreau said . The story was a ritual between father and son . <p> Mason leaned back . A black slouch hat protected his face from the sun . He enjoyed telling the story . Moreau enjoyed listening . <p> It started as a lark-the greatest lark in local history . A neighbor , Colonel Thomas Meacham , was a showman . One might think the difficulties of wrestling a town out of the forests of the North Country , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way all three branches of Sandy Creek froze in winter , but Meacham 's mind never rested . He built the Agricultural Hall on what became the fairgrounds . He trained the local militia . In 1835 the colonel decided to make a " universal " name for himself and the town . Meacham proposed to make the world 's largest cheese and present it to President Andrew Jackson . The Democrats were delighted , the Whigs thought presenting one cheese to another most appropriate , and cynics , which the North Country produced like oaks , thought the idea would mark Sandy Creek as home to the world 's biggest cheese and biggest fool . <p> The odyssey of Meacham 's cheese was the pivotal event in Mason Salisbury 's life . Years later , during the winter of 1862 , when father and son and uncle , each in solitary agony after Antietam , put a gun to his head , and struggled for a reason not to pull the trigger , Mason traced the chain of events to this trip . <p> In July Colonel Meacham soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white oak , and nailed them in a circle to make a gigantic cheese hoop . Meacham made the cheese in the Agricultural Hall , so all could watch . He first removed the permanent exhibits : the only McCormick Reaper north of Albany , a stuffed three-legged chicken , and the pice de rsistance , a two-headed calf pickled in brine . The colonel understood imagination is fired by the rational and the outrageous-scientific marvels and freaks of nature . The cheese was the marvel ; taking it to Andrew Jackson , outrageous . <p> The tale was local lore on a par with the Battle of Sandy Creek during the War of 1812 , and the subsequent hauling of a ninethousand-pound ship 's cable from Big Sandy to Sackets Harbor on the shoulders of two hundred local men . Moreau had been brought up on these tales , but preferred the cheese saga because it involved Salisburys . He enjoying hearing his father tell it , especially on an unseasonably warm afternoon . <p> After completing the hoop , Meacham slaughtered four heifers , removed their fourth stomachs-the gastronomically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into rennet , the ingredient for curdling milk . A giant cheese press took two months to build and looked like a gibbet , except a millstone was lowered from a six-foot arm , not a criminal . <p> In October the colonel 's one hundred fifty cows were milked twice a day , and the milk was poured into oak tubs in the Agricultural Hall . Mason and his brother , Lorenzo , found time to watch . Everybody watched . Whether people thought Meacham the local genius or local fool , the cheese was an event that broke the routine of work and winter . In October , when the poplars blazed yellow along the lake shore and wind ripped down leaves and cut the clear air with cold , Meacham made his cheese . The rennet went in the tubs , and the milk was stirred with long wooden paddles until it curdled . The lumpy liquid was poured through willow baskets leaving curds to be pressed into cheese . After ten days and six thousand gallons of milk , a fourteen-hundred-pound cheese appeared . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , wanted to go to Washington . He was twenty-six and wanted to meet new people , especially important ones , see new places , especially New York City , and meet women , possibly rich . Mason had secretly dreamed of going to New York City to seek his fortune . Lorenzo , taller , quiet , more interested in how things worked than people or cities , thought making the largest cheese only a matter of degree . He was more interested in how it would be transported . Lorenzo had married in March and did n't wish to leave his bride , even to meet Andrew Jackson . <p> The cheese looked like an enormous birthday cake . An artist painted pictures of George Washington , Miss Columbia , and eagle medallions on a long paper , which Meacham dubbed " the National Belt , " and wrapped around the sides of the cheese . The biggest party ever seen in Sandy Creek was held for the departure . Hogs were slaughtered , lake trout fried , turkeys roasted , tubs of mashed potatoes prepared along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet pickles , mustard dill , Indian pudding , and gallons of home-brewed ale and sweet cider . Nothing like it would be seen until the Civil War . <p> The next day , " the Ides of November , " Mason quipped , forty-eight gray stallions pulled a sledge carrying the great cheese and eight smaller ones , only seven hundred fifty pounds each , which were to be given to dignitaries along the way . A cannon fired a salute , and a procession a mile long of buggies and swells on their best mounts followed the cheeses down the Salt Road to Pulaski , where flatboats took them to the lake port of Selkirk . <p> At Pulaski , Mason finished a flask of whiskey and felt the sting of homesickness-being away from home suddenly seemed terribly lonely , even for a man seeking his fortune-when he was tapped on the shoulder . It was Lorenzo . " You ai n't goin ' alone . " Mason hugged his brother and felt Lorenzo 's two-hammered , short-stocked shotgun under his long brown coat . It was a nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than dreams . <p> A schooner had been engaged to take the cheeses and men to Oswego . A vicious storm blew up after dark , ripping down the forward jib and almost washing Meacham 's marvels off the sleetslicked deck . Neither brother had ever been caught on the lake at night in a storm , let alone a winter storm . Mason prayed on his knees and held on to his bunk . Lorenzo shook his head and went on deck to help secure the cheeses . Mason retched . The next day they laughed , and Lorenzo said , " The lake 's a treacherous lady . " Mason swore he 'd never sail on it at night again . Silently , he swore to never be that afraid again . <p> At Oswego the cheeses were put on a canal boat . Crowds cheered , and flags flew . Mason was exhilarated . This was a foretaste of New York City . The men from the North Country were hailed by city folk . Ladies waved handkerchiefs . Gents threw hats in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to the Oswego Canal , then to Syracuse , where the colonel had a sign nailed to the boat-Meacham 's Mighty Marvel The Eighth Wonder of the World-and bigger crowds cheered the Brian Boru as it entered the Erie Canal . Lorenzo was fascinated by the canal . He talked to everyone onboard from the captain to the sweepers about speed , depth , locks , length of journey , even pirates , and agreed the canal was the " eighth wonder of the world . " Mason thought New York City was the eighth wonder , and sometimes wondered if he himself might not be the ninth . The steady pace of the packet , interrupted by wildly enthusiastic crowds , was conducive to dreaming . The brothers pondered the significance of the canal . Lorenzo was impressed by the locks and how the canal had been cut through hills . Mason watched the traffic going east-west and thought of all the commerce starting , ending , or passing through New York City . Gotham was indeed the seat of fortune . <p> Lorenzo was prescient to ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who worked it rough . Buffalo , New York , had the highest murder rate in the country . " Canawlers " finishing the trip from Albany drank , whored , fought , and often found the end of life 's journey with a crushed skull at the bottom of their beloved " canawl . " Near Troy , two hundred fifty miles west , was the " Bloody Cut , " a hotbed for gangs looking for fights and loot between jobs . <p> Moreau and his father sat under a tall oak . Mason watched a patch of thick underbrush by a cluster of willows , oaks , and tag alders by the creek . The fowling pieces rested against a log . Moreau had heard the tale so often , thought about it so much , retold and imagined it , that it was both history and a guide to the future . Young men should travel , be tested , and had to leave the North Country to do so . <p> " I wish I 'd been there , " Moreau said . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtly . " I wish I 'd been with you . " <p> " It was an adventure . " <p> Mason had been twenty-six . Lorenzo twenty-five . They 'd been brought up on tales of 1812 , when Sackets Harbor was the most important ship building port on the Great Lakes and local men ambushed the British at Big Sandy . Mason 's generation had n't gotten a war . He often lamented the fact . War had come in Texas where a hundred eighty men in an old mission would find immorality in death , but in 1835 a Sandy Creek man needed imagination to be noticed . <p> " I wish I had reason to go somewhere , " said Moreau . <p> " That 's the way I felt . " <p> " A man needs to wander , " said Moreau . " Do new things . " <p> " Things he would n't tell anyone ? " said his father . <p> " What makes you say that ? " <p> " I felt it . " <p> When the Brian Boru tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-eyed man climbed on the gangway . Lorenzo had heard about Patch Malone , leader of the roughest gang in the " Cut . " Colonel Meacham , in a black frock coat and high beaver hat , leapt to the top of the gangway and shouted , " This cargo is for President Jackson ! " Mason froze . He thought of himself as a talker , not a fighter , but was speechless . He reached for Lorenzo , who did n't talk or fight much but was capable of both . Lorenzo moved up behind Meacham . A man with Malone struck a lucifer and lit a torch , which was passed around , and a dozen torches flared , filling gangway , dock , and deck with lurid shadows as the brands were raised and lowered in unison . Mason , not moving , hot fear in his throat , watched . He saw a man missing an ear , counted fourteen unshaven rascals , noticed pistols and knives in belts , broken teeth , toothless gaps in grins , and was mesmerized by the glittering single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " said Malone . <p> " Stand clear ! " ordered Meacham . Shadows ominously rose and fell over gangway , deck , and men . <p> " Share the cheese , you damned dandy . " <p> " Not with the likes of you ! " <p> " Too good for Irishmen , are ye ? " <p> Lorenzo was directly behind Colonel Meacham , so the irregular light and leaping shadows did n't reveal the contours of the weapon under the brown coat , or perhaps Malone was carried away with audacity and liquor . <p> " We ai n't Democrats ! We 're Whigs ! " shouted Patch Malone , to the delight of his followers . <p> " Whigs ! Whigs ! " yelled the torch-bearers . <p> " You 're scoundrels ! " said Meacham . <p> Malone swaggered up the gangway . " I like that hat ! " Malone reached for Meacham 's topper , and Lorenzo Salisbury did to Patch Malone what Hernn Corts did to Montezuma-took him hostage , sticking both barrels into Patch 's stomach and saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-eyed man onto the deck and then pulled back each brass hammer . Each clicked menacingly . <p> " Tell your men to get away from the boat . " <p> Malone looked at the gun and turned his head . " Back , men . " <p> The gangway was pulled up , and the Brian Boru untied . As the packet departed , Meacham pushed Patch Malone overboard . <p> Even as a child , Moreau thought the moral of that episode was n't the gun , quick-thinking , or courage , but some men are believed when they say they 'll shoot you ; others are n't . Moreau did n't think he was one of those believed . Or his father . Uncle Lorenzo was another matter . <p> At Albany , Colonel Meacham gave cheeses to Governor Marcy and the legislature . The boat and its cargo were cheered by hundreds waving flags , hats , and handkerchiefs . A few carried signs supporting President Jackson and lauding the cheese . Mason noticed people of all variety : mechanics , stout wives , lanky farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who squealed and kissed each other , gawky boys who made faces , pinched girls , or threw a stone and ran . The North Country men were toasted by assemblymen and senators in black coats as shiny and worn as the colonel 's . Mason thought giving toasts and speeches was a far cry from milling and wondered what it took to stand for office . There was a world elsewhere . Mason looked at his gabardine trousers , rough shirt , and patched coat , and wondered if he had enough money to buy new clothes in New York . A man ought to look a certain way . <p> The Brian Boru entered the Hudson River , and Mason had never seen anything as majestic as the cliffs , towering trees , wide river , and constant traffic . All water , he told Lorenzo , leads to New York . One could go from Lake Superior to London or Africa or China . Water was the road to the world , and they were on it . <p> " I 've never seen anything so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lorenzo . <p> Both men were awed by the broad river as it passed under the promontories of West Point and sluiced through the Storm King Gap . Even in cold , gray December , they felt the genteel richness of the Hudson Valley . This was life backed by money and families who 'd been here two hundred years . Mason wanted to live hereeither in this patrician valley where winter did n't bury cabins , next to water that would n't kill you , or in the city rising at the mouth of the mighty Hudson . Any fool could see this was the gateway to the world . Lorenzo thought Mason saw what Mason wanted to see . This was nothing new , and Lorenzo kept his opinion to himself . <p> Neither Salisbury had ever been farther than Oswego . They were n't prepared for Lower Manhattan Island . The farms , trees , and roads of the upper island seemed a civilized use of marvelousIy situated land , but as the river got more crowded with sidewheelers belching wood-smoke , packets , schooners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river-and the shore such a continuous line of spars , rigging , and hulls a man might walk around the tip of Manhattan without touching land or water-they saw and smelled the City of New York . <p> Mason noted they arrived on the Ides of December , a full month out of the North Country . " Another fateful day , " he told his brother . <p> At Coenties Slip on the East River , the Brian Boru was met by Bushrod T. Hawkins , a Manhattan Meacham , and proprietor of Hawkins ' American Museum on Pearl Street . Hawkins had a sleigh , reporters , and a crowd waiting . The sleigh was covered with red , white , and blue bunting , and a sign trumpeted the arrival of the world 's biggest cheese . After listening to speeches and watching the crowd , which hooted , winked , laughed , threw hats in the air , and loudly cheered Andrew Jackson , the brothers decided this was n't a place to be clapped on the back and bought a drink by a stranger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and the Salisburys ventured into Manhattan by themselves . <p> They walked Pearl Street , taking in the maze of new wooden buildings that seemed to have sprung up on every available patch of land . Lorenzo commented on that particularly New York street mix of men with nothing to do and men in a devil of a hurry . Mason admitted the place was huge and filthy . They both thought the natives either looked too closely or paid you no attention . Lorenzo , gun under his long coat , wondered how so many people could live so close together without killing each other . He was told they frequently did . The brothers stopped for a nickel glass of beer and accompanying free lunch-bad cheese on bad breadin a place with sawdust on the floor and grimy pictures of racehorses and prizefighters , including Tom Molineaux , ex-Virginian slave turned British pugilist , on the walls . Mason confided to Lorenzo he was thinking of seeking his fortune in New York , and Lorenzo replied , " I feared so . " Mason realized his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Country , and was deeply touched . He took his brother 's arm when they walked out . <p> Neither Salisbury liked the hovels of the poor , the masses of people , especially the forlorn young girls selling corn from baskets . They had never seen garbage in the streets , dealt with only by freeranging pigs , dead horses left to stink and decay , so many low , smoky doggeries full of men , or the rabbit warren of narrow , crooked mercantile streets , but there was energy . There was , at least for Mason , the grit and anonymity-the feeling anything can happen , right now , and nobody will know-that frightened and intrigued strangers in New York . Lorenzo said he was glad he was married ; Mason was glad he was n't . They went to the district where unaccompanied women appeared after dark . How Mason knew about the Bowery was n't clear , but they had been on a boat for a month . Mason told Lorenzo it was the best area for a cheap dinner . Lorenzo said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , the brothers settled for root beer at three cents a glass . Mason was cautious , Lorenzo was mindful of Mason , so it was enough to eat sausage , drink root beer , and walk streets that ended at docks full of hard-looking men and dark river cluttered with spars and rigging . <p> Whatever might have happened with con men , corn girls , unaccompanied women , or the host of canny Manhattan folk who emerged after dark-the potential comedy or disaster of Yankee jakes negotiating the Bowery-was cut short by the night of the sixteenth . Mason 's facetious foreboding about the Ides of November and December came wildly true . Fire broke out around nine p.m . Sheets of flame rose over the tall dry goods and hardware stores on Merchant Street and raced through the district incinerating hovels , factories , doggeries , even the Stock Exchange . In fifteen minutes , fifty buildings were on fire . Then all structures , brick , stone , wood-warehouse , office , or church-were burning . The temperature was near zero . It was snowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving snow . Wells and cisterns froze . Fireman , exhausted from fighting a large fire at Burling 's Slip the previous day , and decimated by cholera the previous summer , were slow to arrive . When they did , most hydrants were frozen ; when hoses sprayed , water froze into hail . The wind blew so hard the East River was flattened and suction hoses could n't reach the water . It was disaster worthy of any country parson 's Gomorrahic vision of New York . <p> Moreau loved the story . It was raw adventure . He frequently imagined his father and uncle getting through the panic of passersby , terrified horses , flaming buildings . " We thought the sky was on fire , " Mason said . Moreau could see them running by singed teams straining to pull stuck fire wagons , dodging frightened citizens and squealing pigs , skirting dead horses . For a boy in freezing Sandy Creek , the vision of a world on fire and his father and uncle negotiating blazing streets , barely able to breathe , strangers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North Country and a terrific adventure . It was what Moreau chafed for now . <p> " Were you scared ? " Moreau asked . <p> " No time to be scared . Or maybe I was so scared , I did n't notice . We ran through that inferno , and I knew I could n't ever live there . Not in that place . We were cured like hams in a smokehouse . " <p> Fire raged across Lower Manhattan . The Salisburys raced down Pearl Street to Hawkins ' American Museum . <p> " We come with the cheese ! " Lorenzo shouted . " By God we 'll leave with it ! " <p> The wind was at their backs pushing the fire , filling the street with cinders and smoke . The brothers reached the building and found the colonel . Meacham put horse blankets over the cheese , and the three men had to carry it to a sleigh . Back home it took eleven men and a cheering crowd , but this was n't home . <p> Moreau looked at the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , but Moreau preferred his father 's tale to tramping out a pheasant or rousting a grouse . He looked at the old man-white beard , hard muscles , alert eyes-and wondered what the young man had been like . Who was that man who left Sandy Creek to do things he would n't tell anyone ? There was a restlessness about Mason now , so uncharacteristic of the North Country , a willingness to engage anyone in talk on any subject , though the subject invariably became abolition . Moreau knew his father had been tested . Tested in the big city . What a gift , he thought , provided you survived . That was the great thing about the cheese story . The teller had been there and survived . <p> Moreau stretched in the afternoon sun and wondered what he had to tell . Was it this story , or the tale of two hundred men carrying a four-ton cable twenty miles ? They were wonderful stories , but they were n't his story . Moreau believed sometime in a man 's life he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he could n't , but he would be asked . No one ever told Moreau this , but he fervently believed it . His father did the impossible-even if it was for a cheese . Moreau knew the tale had been polished , nuances adjusted , and lessons embedded in the narrative . Had his father really been ready to move to New York ? If the brothers had arrived any day but December 15 , 1835 , would Moreau be a city slicker , raised in Manhattan ? Would the Salisburys be rich ? Would Moreau be a clerk in a high-backed chair with a mean , long-nosed boss ? The story put the virtues of Sandy Creek in clear relief . Maybe too clear , but Moreau loved it . He wanted to see the sky on fire and dash through hell . If the Apocalypse was n't available , a long trip might do . <p> The men got the cheese to the sleigh . Under ordinary circumstances this would have been miraculous , but in the midst of a fire that would burn for sixteen hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel and the two Salisburys dragged the cheese off its pedestal-it was not destined for a long New York run-and hauled it out as the museum roof caught fire . The brothers hung on to cheese and sleigh as Meacham whipped the horses , and they flew down Pearl Street . Sparks went over their heads , burned the horses , danced in red air . " The devil do n't drive faster ! " Lorenzo yelled . Mason looked back and saw the American Museum go up as they dashed for the river . Smoke choked the streets ; cinders burned pedestrians . Horses reared . They saw a fire wagon turn over at the corner of Water Street . <p> " Fire follows sin ! " Meacham yelled . <p> " We ai n't sinned yet ! " shouted Lorenzo . <p> The sleigh bounced over debris , slipped on ice , skidded on frozen ruts , splashed through freezing water . The red , white , and blue bunting , the National Belt , ripped . The brothers dug their hands into cheese and managed to keep fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for nothing they had grown up hauling sacks of grain and meal . <p> Moreau liked thinking of his father and uncle hurling through New York City 's worst fire , up to their elbows in cheese , rushing through flame , sparks , and falling debris . Whoever heard of anything so wonderful ? The lessons were clear : heroism is expected ; survival is purchased with courage . <p> A son invents his father out of such tales . <p> Within sight of the Brian Boru straining at its mooring but untouched by spark or flame , they heard a ferocious crack . The heat was so intense , Mason thought the air had exploded . " Look out ! " Lorenzo shouted . A church steeple teetered : cinders and flame shot hundreds of feet in the air . <p> They did n't have time to jump . <p> The colonel whipped the team . The story could have ended in the ruins of Pearl Street in sight of the canal packet , providing fodder for generations of North Country sermons on town hubris and city peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeple came down in a plume of sparks , glowing wood , and rushing flame . It grazed the sleigh 's tailgate . <p> They made the dock , loaded the cheese , and the packet pulled out into the East River . <p> " What the hell good are churches , anyway ? " Lorenzo said . <p> The brothers saw slaves in Maryland . Neither had seen one before . In Baltimore , slaves unloaded freight and sang carols with a melancholy intensity , not easily forgotten . Mason wondered if this familiar yet strange sound was a sign , but decided a sign should be more dramatic . <p> No crowds greeted the cheese in Washington . People at the station were more interested in the disaster in New York . Christmas in the capital was a muddy , lonely affair . Everyone , it seemed , had somewhere else to be . The city was a disappointment . The roads were unpaved and the buildings so far apart fire was n't a threat . Mason said Washington was a muddy idea for a city . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best month . " Lorenzo wondered how populated the city might become . Colonel Meacham was informed President Jackson , though appreciative of the cheese , was too sick to meet the North Country men . <p> The city of mud and damp cold offered no dazzling parties , connections , or rich widows . A slave did tip his hat and say , " Welcome , cheese men , " as Meacham 's fourteen hundred pounds disappeared into the back of the White House , but the colonel and his party were not the celebrities they had been in Syracuse and Albany . Meacham was miserable . The day before they left the nation 's capital , with its few scattered impressive buildings , indifferent hotels , infamous boarding houses , provided Mason his sign . <p> Mason had stopped looking for signs . He was trying to shake a cough and congestion brought on by the cold in New York and damp of Washington . He was ready to go home to warmer fires , tell everyone New York City was dirty and crowded even when not on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to see him go . <p> On Christmas Day , Mason and Lorenzo walked the deserted streets , viewed the long , open expanses between buildings , and wished they were home . <p> " I 'm not impressed , " Mason said . <p> Lorenzo shook his head . " It ai n't the Erie Canal . " <p> " It ai n't even Albany , " said Mason . <p> The brothers passed an empty pen that seemed small for cattle . A post equipped with chains revealed its use . <p> " Slaves , " said Lorenzo . <p> " At least they do n't buy and sell human beings in the capital of the world 's only democracy on the birthday of the Savior , " said Mason . <p> They walked towards the White House and considered stopping to inquire about the President 's health . The day was gray and cold , though walking in the damp air felt less chilly than their drafty boarding house . The Salisburys were wearing their long coats , and Lorenzo had his short-stocked shotgun . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of repair than their own lodgings , and heard screams and the sound of a whip . They went around back to a stable , where a heavy man , his white collarless shirt stained with sweat , lashed a Negro . The Negro stood on an unpainted stool , hands tied together and hung over a rusty hook in a joist . His neck , shoulders , back , and feet were bare . His shiny black back was bloody , and his ragged pants were bright with blood . Three stable hands passed a jug . " Put your back into it , John , " said one . They wore soiled shirts with the sleeves rolled up . Mason saw everything in an instant , as if daguerreotype images were imprinted on his memory . A white mark on the forehead of a horse in a stall . The gap between the blackened teeth of the man swigging out of the jug . Rakes and bridles on the walls . A saddle in a pile of straw . The upraised hoof of a gray horse in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cracked . The crease in a slouch hat in the straw beside John . Manure on John 's boots . The kind of whip called a cowhide . And most of all , red welts , blood flowing on the Negro 's shiny back , muscles and tendons stretched so they might break . Bloody feet on tiptoe on the rough stool . <p> The brothers stood in the door . Lorenzo put his hand under his coat . <p> " You got business ? " said John . He spat . <p> The Salisburys did n't answer . <p> " It costs to watch a cow hidin ' , " said the man with the jug . <p> " A quarter . " <p> " That ai n't enough , " said a squat man with big forearms and bulging stomach , who leaned against a stall . <p> The Salisburys looked at each other . <p> John gave the Negro two hard lashes and grunted with the effort . He evidently enjoyed inflicting pain . The Negro turned , and Mason saw his face by the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging . Blood ran down the man 's bare feet and dripped on the stool . He screamed . John hit him again . <p> Mason was humiliated , fascinated , and furious . He could n't watch ; he could n't not watch . He felt the raw satisfaction of the stable hands . They guffawed and swigged . He felt the hot arrogance of cruelty in John . The vicious pride . Mason again stood before men . He took off his coat , walked over straw , by the hat , lantern , John , the whip . He put his coat over the man 's bloody shoulders . The coat covered him to the ankles . <p> " Damn waste of a good coat , " said John , and spat in the straw . <p> " He 's cold , " said Mason . <p> " Yankees , " said a stable hand . <p> " Yankees do n't know niggers , " said another . <p> " Do n't know nothin ' . " <p> " He 's cold , " said Mason . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro 's ear with the whip . <p> Tears ran down the black man 's face . He looked old . Old enough to be their father . <p> Lorenzo was behind Mason . Coat unbuttoned . <p> " Get out , " said John . <p> " Do you call yourself a Christian ? " said Mason , looking John in the eye . <p> The whip made a stinging sound and peremptory crack as it hit Mason across the face . Mason doubled over , clutching his face . Lorenzo hit John along the side of the head with the barrel of the shotgun and in the stomach with the butt . John staggered and sat down in the straw . The whip dropped . John put his hand to his head , which was bleeding , and groaned . <p> A stable hand reached for a pitchfork . Another picked up a rake . <p> " Do n't , " said Lorenzo . It was the voice he used in the " Bloody Cut . " <p> No one moved . <p> Mason said , " Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorenzo . <p> The Negro sobbed like a child . The sound was unbearable . <p> " I 'll kill him , " said Mason . A red mark ran from Mason 's cheek to his hairline . <p> " It 's his country , " said Lorenzo , moving back , gun leveled at John . <p> Mason stepped on the hat . " For now . " <p> The brothers walked out of the stable . Mason did n't look back . Lorenzo did n't take his eye off the men . <p> The Salisburys kept walking . They heard the whip and screams louder than before . Mason did n't feel the cold . <p> He 'd never been so hot . <p>
