IT STARTED ON THAT frozen world , among the stone figures in their almost suspended animation . Through her eyes , the irises two salmon moons under luminous white brows , like fissures in the world of rules , of logic . The starship 's mind watched through the prism of their wonder , and began to make its change . <p> She peered at the statue for a solid , unblinking minute . Protesting tears gathered to blur her vision , but Rathere 's gaze did not waver . Another minute , and a tic tugged at one eye , taking up the steady rhythm of her heartbeat . <p> She kept watching . <p> " Ha ! " she finally proclaimed . " I saw it move . " <p> " Where ? " asked a voice in her head , unconvinced . <p> Rathere rubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands , mouth open , awestruck by the shooting red stars behind her eyelids . Her blinks made up now for the lost minutes , and she squinted at the dusty town square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it moved . But maybe ... only a centimeter . " <p> The voice made an intimate sound , a soft sigh beside Rathere 's ear that did not quite reject her claim . <p> " Maybe just a millimeter , " Rathere offered . A touch of unsure emphasis hovered about the last word ; she was n't used to tiny units of measurement , though from her father 's work she understood light years and metaparsecs well enough . <p> " In three minutes ? Perhaps a micrometer , " the voice in her head suggested . <p> Rathere rolled the word around in her mouth . In response to her questioning expression , software was invoked , as effortless as reflex . Images appeared upon the rough stones of the square : a meter-stick , a hundredth of its length glowing bright red , a detail box showing that hundredth with a hundredth of its length flashing , yet another detail box ... completing the six orders of magnitude between meter and micrometer . Next to the final detail box a cross-section of human hair floated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . <p> " That small ? " she whispered . A slight intake of breath , a softening of her eyes ' focus , a measurable quantity of adrenaline in her bloodstream were all noted . Indicators of her simple awe : that a distance could be so small , a creature so slow . <p> " About half that , actually , " said the voice in her head . <p> " Well , " Rathere murmured , leaning back into the cool hem of shade along the stone wall , " I knew I saw it move . " <p> She eyed the stone creature again , a look of triumph on her face . <p> Woven into her white tresses were black threads , filaments that moved through her hair in a slow deliberate dance , like the tendrils of some predator on an ocean floor . This restless skein was always seeking the best position to capture Rathere 's subvocalized words , the movements of her eyes , the telltale secretions of her skin . Composed of exotic alloys and complex configurations of carbon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-maintenance . But a microwave link connected them to their real intelligence : the Al core aboard Rathere 's starship home . <p> Two of the black filaments wound their way into her ears , where they curled in intimate contact with her tympanic membranes . <p> " The statues are always moving , " the voice said to her . " But very slowly . " <p> Then it reminded her to stick on another sunblock patch . She was a very pale girl . <p> EVEN HERE on Petraveil , Rathere 's father insisted that she wear the minder when she explored alone . The city was safe enough , populated mostly by academics here to study the glacially slow indigenous lifeforms . <p> The lithomorphs themselves were incapable of posing a threat , unless one stood still for a hundred years or so . And Rathere was , ' as she put it , almost fifteen , near majority age back in the Local Cluster . Even harnessing the processing power of the starship 's AI , the minder was a glorified babysitter . <p> But Isaah was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Remember what happened to your mother , " he would say . And that was that . <p> Rathere shrugged and let the tendrils wrap themselves into her hair . The voice in her ears cautioned her incessantly about sunburn , and it strictly forbade several classes of recreational drugs , but all in all it was n't bad company . It certainly knew a lot . <p> " How long would it take , creeping forward in micrometers ? " Rathere asked . <p> " How long would what take ? " Even with their intimate connection , the AI could not read her mind . It was still working on that . <p> " To get all the way to the Northern Range . Probably a million years ? " she ventured . <p> The starship , for whom a single second was a 16-teraflop reverie , spent endless minutes of every day accessing the planetary library . Rathere 's questions came in packs , herds , stampedes . <p> No one knew how the lithomorphs reproduced , but it was guessed that they bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At least a hundred thousand years , ' I the AI said . " Such a long journey .... What would it look like ? " <p> The AI delved into its package of pedagogical visualization software , applied its tremendous processing power ( sufficient for the occult mathematics of astrogation , and rendered the spectacles of that long , slow trip . Across Rathere 's vision it accelerated passing days and wheeling stars until they were invisible flickers . It hummed the subliminal pulse of seasonal change and painted the sprightly jitter of rivers changing course , the slow but visible dance of mountainous cousins . <p> " Yes , " Rathere said softly , her voice turned breathy . The Al savored the dilation of her pupils , the spiderwebs of red blossoming on her cheeks . Then it peered again into the vision it had created , trying to learn what rules of mind and physiology connected the scintillating images with the girl 's reaction . <p> " They are n't really slow , " Rathere murmured . " The world is just so fast ...... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues of Petraveil . <p> Their giant forms crowded the town square . They dotted the high volcanic mountain overlooking the city . They bathed in the rivers that surged across the black equatorial plains , staining the waters downstream with rusted metal colors . <p> The first time he had come here , years before , Isaah had noticed that in the short and sudden afternoon rains , the tears shed from their eyes carried a black grime that sparkled with colored whorls when the sun returned . <p> They were , it had been determined a few decades before , very much alive . Humanity had carefully studied the fantastically slow creatures since discovering their glacial , purposeful , perhaps even intelligent animation . Mounted next to each lithomorph was a plaque that played timeseries of the last forty years : a dozen steps , a turn of the head as another of its kind passed , a few words in their geologically deliberate gestural language . <p> Most of the creatures ' bodies were hidden underground , their secrets teased out with deep radar and gravitic density imaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting the surface like the dorsal fin of a dolphin breaking into the air . <p> Isaah was here to steal their stories . He was a scoop . <p> " How long until we leave here ? " Rathere asked . <p> " That 's for your father to decide , " the Al answered . <p> " But when will he decide ? " <p> " When the right scoop comes . " <p> " When will that come ? " <p> This sort of mildly recursive loop had once frustrated the AI 's conversational packages . Rathere 's speech patterns were those of a child younger than her years , the result of her life since her mother 's disappearance : traveling among obscure , Outward worlds with only her taciturn father and the AI for company . Rathere never formulated what she wanted to know succinctly , she reeled off questions from every direction , attacking an issue like a host of small predators taking down a larger animal . Her AI companion could only fend her off with answers until ( often unexpectedly ) Rathere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , your father will decide to go . " <p> " Like what story ? " <p> " He does n't know yet . " <p> She nodded her head . From her galvanic skin response , her pupils , the gradual slowing of her heart , the Al saw that it had satisfied her . But still another question came . <p> " Why did n't you just say so ? " <p> In the Expansion , information traveled no faster than transportation , and scoops like Isaah enriched themselves by being first with news . The standard transmission network employed small , fast drone craft that moved among the stars on a fixed schedule . The drones promulgated news throughout the Expansion with a predictable and neutral efficiency , gathering information to centralized nodes , dispersing it by timetable . Scoops like Isaah , on the other hand , were inefficient , unpredictable , and , most importantly , unfair . They cut across the concentric web of the drone network , skipping junctions , skimming profits . Isaah would recognize that the discovery of a mineable asteroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump straight between the two points , beating the faster but fastidious drones by a few precious hours . A successful scoop knew the markets on many planets , had acquaintance with aggressive investors and unprincipled speculators . Sometimes , the scooped news of a celebrity 's death , surprise marriage , or arrest could be sold for its entertainment value . And some scoops were information pirates . Isaah had himself published numerous novels by Sethmare Viin , his favorite author , machine-translated en route by the starship AL In some systems , Isaah 's version had been available weeks before the authorized edition . <p> The peripatetic life of a scoop had taken Isaah and Rathere throughout the Expansion , but he always returned to Petraveil . His refined instincts for a good scoop told him something was happening here . The fantastically slow natives must be doing something . He would spend a few weeks , sometimes a few months watching the stone creatures , wondering what they were up to . Isaah did n't know what it might be , but he felt that one day they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a scoop . <p> " How long do the lithomorphs live ? " <p> " No one knows . " <p> " What do they eat ? " <p> " They do n't really eat at all . They - " <p> " What 's that one doing ? " <p> The minder accessed the planetary library , plumbing decades of research on the creatures . But not quickly enough to answer before <p> " What do they think about us ? " Rathere asked . " Can they see us ? " <p> To that , it had no answer . <p> Perhaps the lithos had noticed the whirring creatures around them , or more likely had spotted the semi-permanent buildings around the square . But the lithomorphs ' reaction to the sudden human invasion produced only a vague , cosmic worry , like knowing one 's star will collapse in a few billion years . <p> For Rathere , though , the lives of the lithomorphs were far more immediate . Like the Al minder , they were mentors , imaginary friends . Their immobility had taught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an analog clock 's minute hand , the transformation of a high cirrus cloud , the slow descent of the planet 's old red sun behind the northern mountains . Their silence taught her to read lips , to make messages in the ripples of stone and metal that flowed as slowly as glaciers in their wakes . She found a patient irony in their stances . They were wise , but it was n't the wisdom of an ancient tree or river ; rather , they seemed to possess the reserve of a watchfully silent guest at a party . <p> Rathere told stories about them to the starship 's Al . Tales of their fierce , glacial battles , of betrayal on the mating trail , of the creatures ' slow intrigues against the human colonists of Petraveil , millennia-long plots of which every chapter lasted centuries . <p> At first , the AI gently interrupted her to explain the facts : the limits of scientific understanding . The lithomorphs were removed through too many orders of magnitude in time , too distant on that single axis ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied were mere seconds of their history . But Rathere ignored the machine . She named the creatures , inventing secret missions for them that unfolded while the human population slept , like statues springing to life when no one was watching . <p> Ultimately , the Al was won over by Rathere 's stories , her insistence that the creatures were knowable . Her words painted expressions , names , and passions upon them ; she made them live by fiat . The Al 's pedagological software did not object to storytelling , so it began to participate in Rathere 's fantasies . It nutured that invisibly slow world , kept order and consistency , remembering names , plots , places . And slowly , it began to give the stories credence , suspending disbelief . Finally , the stories ' truth was as integral to the AI as the harm-prevention protocols or logical axioms deepwired in its code . <p> For Isaah , however , there was no scoop here on Petraveil . The lithomorphs continued their immortal dance in silence . And elections were approaching in a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargos of information . <p> The night that Rathere and Isaah left the planet , the Al hushed her crying with tales of how her invented narratives had unfolded , as if the statues had sprung to human-speed life once left behind . As it navigated her father 's small ship , the AI offered this vision to Rathere : she had been a visitor to a frozen moment , but the story continued . <p> In high orbit above the next planet on their route , a customs sweep revealed that the starship 's Al had improved its Turing Quotient to 0.37 . Isaah raised a wary eyebrow . The Al 's close bond with his daughter had accelerated its development . The increased Turing Quotient showed that the device was performing well as tutor and companion . But Isaah would have to get its intelligence downgraded when they returned to the Local Cluster . If the machine 's Turing Quotient were allowed to reach 1.0 , it would be a person - no longer legally his property . Isaah turned pale at the thought . The cost of replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire trip . <p> He made a mental note to record the Turing Quotient at every customs point . <p> Isaah was impressed , though , with how the AI handled entry into the planet 's almost liquid atmosphere . It designed a new landing configuration , modifying the hydroplanar shape that the craft assumed for gas giant descents . Its piloting as they plunged through successive layers of pressure-dense gasses was particularly elegant ; it made adjustments at every stage , subtle changes to the craft that saved precious time . The elections were only days away . <p> It was strange , Isaah pondered as the ship neared the high-pressure domes of the trade port , that the companionship of a fourteen-year-old girl would improve a machine 's piloting skills . The thought brought a smile of fatherly pride to his lips , but he soon turned his mind to politics . <p> THEY WERE going swimming . <p> As Rathere slipped out of her clothes , the AI implemented its safety protocols . The minder distributed itself across her body , becoming a layer of black lace against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Rathere rolled the garment onto her limbs . There were no signs of damage , no telltale fissures of a repaired seam . <p> " You said the atmosphere could crush a human to jelly , " Rathere said . " How can this little suit protect me ? " <p> The starship explained the physics of resistance fields to her while checking the suit against safety specifications it had downloaded that morning . It took very good care of Rathere . <p> She had seen the huge behemoths at breakfast , multiplied by the facets of the dome 's cultured-diamond windows . Two mares and a child swimming a few kilometers away , leaving their glimmering trails . The minder had noted her soft sigh , her dilated pupils , the sudden increase in her heart rate . It had discovered the suit rental agency with a quick search of local services , and had guided her past its offices on their morning ramble through the human-habitable levels of the dome . <p> Rathere 's reaction to the holographic advertising on the agency 's wall had matched the AI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , the momentary hyperventilation . The machine 's internal model of Rathere , part of its pedagogical software , grew more precise and replete every day . The software was designed for school tutors who interacted with their charges only a few hours a day , but Rathere and the Al were constant companions . The feedback between girl and machine built with an unexpected intensity . <p> And now , as the pressure lock hissed and rumbled , the minder relished its new configuration ; its attenuated strands spiderwebbed across Rathere 's flesh , intimate as never before . It drank in the data greedily , like some thirsty polygraph recording capillary dilation , skin conductivity , the shudders and tensions of every muscle . <p> Then the lock buzzed , and they swam out into the crushing , planetspanning ocean , almost one creature . <p> Isaah paced the tiny dimensions of his starship . The elections could be a gold mine or a disaster . A radical separatist party was creeping forward in the polls , promising to shut off interstellar trade . Their victory would generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change throughout the Expansion . Even the radicals ' defeat would rock distant markets , as funds currently hedged against them heaved a sigh of relief . <p> But the rich stakes had drawn too much competition . Scoops like Isaah were in abundance here , and a number of shipping consortia had sent their own representatives . Their ships were stationed in orbit , bristling with courier drones like nervous porcupines . <p> Isaah sighed , and stared into the planetary ocean 's darkness . Perhaps the era of freelance scoops was ending . The wild days of the early Expansion seemed like the distant past now . He 'd read that one day drones would shrink to the size of a finger , with hundreds launched each day from every system . Or a wave that propogated in metaspace would be discovered , and news would spread at equal speed in all directions , like the information cones of lightspeed physics . <p> When that happened , his small starship would become a rich man 's toy , its profitable use suddenly ended . Isaah called up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to owning his ship outright . just one more good scoop , or two , and he could retire to a life of travel among peaceful worlds , perhaps searching for his lost wife , instead of darting among emergencies and conflagrations . Maybe this trip .... <p> Isaah drummed his fingers , watching the hourly polls like a doctor whose patient is very near the edge . <p> Rathere and the Al swam every day , oblivious to politics , following the glitter-trails of the behemoths . The huge animals excreted a constant wake of the photoactive algae they used for ballast . When Rathere swam through these luminescent microorganisms , the shockwaves of her passage catalyzed their photochemical reactions , a universe of swirling galaxies ignited by every stroke . <p> Rathere began to sculpt lightstorms in the phosphorescent medium . The algae hung like motes of potential in her path , invisible until she swam through them , the wake of her energies like glowing sculptures . She choreographed her swimming to leave great swirling structures of activated algae . <p> The AI found itself unable to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make . Without training , without explicit criteria , without any models to follow , Rathere was creating order from this shapeless swarm of ejecta . Even the Al 's pedagogical software offered no help . <p> But the AI saw the sculptures ' beauty , if only in the expansion of Rathere 's capillaries , the seemingly random firings of neurons along her spine , the tears in her eyes as the glowing algae faded back into darkness . <p> The Al plunged into an art database on the local net , trying to divine what laws governed these acts of creation . It discussed the light sculptures with Rathere , comparing their evanescent forms to the shattered structures of Camelia Parker or the hominid blobs of Henry Moore . It showed her millennia of sculpture , gauging her reactions until a rough model of her tastes could be constructed . But the model was bizarrely convoluted , disturbingly shaggy around the edges , with gaps and contradictions and outstretched , gerrymandered spurs that implied art no one had yet made . <p> The Al often created astrogational simulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Metaspace was predictable ; these simulations anticipated reality with a high degree of precision . But the machine 's model of Rathere 's aesthetic was post-hoc , a mere retrofit to her pure , instinctive gestures . It raised more questions than it answered . <p> While Rathere slept , the machine wondered how one learned to have intuition . <p> THE ELECTIONS CAME , and the radicals and their allies seized a razor-thin majority in the planetary Diet . Isaah cheered as his craft rose through the ocean . A scoop was within reach . He headed for a distant and obscure ore-producing system , expending vast quantities of fuel , desperate to be the first scoop there . <p> Rathere stood beside her rejoicing father , looking out through the receding ocean a bit sadly . She stroked her shoulder absently , touching the minder still stretched across her skin . <p> The minder 's epidermal configuration had become permanent . its strands were distributed to near invisibility in a microfiber-thin mesh across Rathere . Its nanorepair mechanisms attended to her zits and the errant hairs on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship 's AI taking control over the nuances of her insulin balance , her sugar level , and the tiny electrical jolts that kept her muscles fit . Rathere slept without covers now , the minder 's skein warming her like a lattice of microscopic heating elements . In its ever-present blanket , she began to neglect subvocalizing their conversations , her endless one-sided prattle annoying Isaah on board the tiny ship . <p> " Zero-point-five-six ? " muttered Issah to himself at the next customs sweep . The Al was developing much faster than its parameters should allow . Something unexpected was happening with the unit , and they were a long way from home . Unless Isaah was very careful , the AI might reach personhood before they returned to the LC . <p> He sent a coded message to an acquaintance in the Local Cluster , someone who dealt with such situations , just in case . Then he turned his attention to the local newsfeed . <p> The heavy element market showed no sudden changes over the last few weeks . Isaah 's gamble had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripples of news about the ocean planet 's election . The economic shockwave was n't here yet . <p> He felt the heady thrill of a scoop , of secret knowledge that was his alone . It was like prognostication , a glimpse into the future . Elements extracted by giant turbine from that distant world 's oceans were also mined from this system 's asteroid belt . Soon , everyone here would be incrementally richer as the ocean planet pulled its mineral wealth from the Expansion common market . The markets would edge upward across the board . <p> Isaah began to place his bets . <p> The dark-skinned boy looked down upon the asteroid field with a pained expression . Rathere watched the way his long bangs straightened , then curled to encircle his cheeks again when he raised his head . But her stomach clenched when she looked down through the transparent floor ; the party was on the lowest level of a spin-gravitied ring , and black infinity seemed to be pulling at her through the glassene window . The AI lovingly recorded the parameters of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked the fattest , oldest boy at the party . " You can just make out a mining ship down there , " the dark-skinned boy answered . <p> " Oh , dear , " said the fat boy . " Upper-class guilt . And before lunchtime . " <p> The dark-skinned boy shook his head . " It 's just that seeing those poor wretches does n't make me feel like drinking . " <p> The fat boy snorted . <p> " This is what I think of your poor little miners , " he said , upending the bottle . A stream of champagne gushed and then sputtered from the bottle , spread fizzing on the floor . The other party-goers laughed , politely scandalized , then murmured appreciatively as the floor cleaned itself , letting the champagne pass through to the hard vacuum on the other side , where it flash-froze shattered by its own air bubbles ) , then floated away peacefully in myriad , sunlit galaxies . <p> There were a few moments of polite applause . <p> The boy Darien looked at Rathere woundedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come to his aid . <p> The anguish in his dark , beautiful face sent a shiver through her , a tremor that resonated through every level of the AL <p> " Come on , dammit ! " she subvocalized . <p> " Two seconds , " the minder 's voice reassured . <p> The ring was home to the oligarchs who controlled the local system 's mineral wealth . A full fifteen years old now , Rathere had fallen into the company of their pleasure-obsessed children , who never stopped staring at her exotic skin and hair , and who constantly exchanged droll witticisms . Rathere , her socialization limited to her father and the doting Al , was unfamiliar with the art of banter . She did n't like being intimidated by locals . The frustration was simply and purely unbearable . <p> " The price of that champagne could have bought one of those miners out of debt peonage , " Darien said darkly , <p> " Just the one ? " asked the fat boy , looking at the label with mock concern . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another measure of suffering . <p> " Now ! " Rathere mind-screamed . " I hate that fat guy ! " The AI hated him , too . <p> The search cascaded across its processors , the decompressed data of its libraries clobbering astrogation calculations it had performed only hours before . That did n't matter . It would be weeks before Isaah would be ready to depart , and the exigencies of conversation did not allow delay . The library data included millennia of plays , novels , films , interactives . To search them quickly , the AI needed vast expanses of memory space . <p> " Maybe when my little golden shards of champagne drift by , some miner will think , 11 could 've used that money , " ' the fat boy said almost wistfully . " But then again , if they thought about money at all , would they be so far in debt ? " <p> The fat boy 's words were added to the search melange , thickening it by a critical degree . A dozen hits appeared in the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is only one class ... " <p> " ... that thinks more about money than the rich , " repeated Rathere . <p> There was a sudden quiet throughout the party , the silence of waiting for more . <p> " And that is the poor , " she said . <p> Darien looked at Rathere quizzically , as if she were being too glib . She paused a moment , editing the rest of the quote in her head . <p> " The poor can think of nothing else but money , " she said carefully . <p> " That is the misery of being poor . " <p> Darien smiled at her , which - impossibly - made him even more beautiful . <p> " Or the misery of being rich , unless one is a fool , " he said . <p> There was no applause for the exchange , but Rathere again felt the ripple of magic that her pilfered pronouncements created . The ancient words blended with her exotic looks and accent , never failing to entertain the oligarchs ' children , who thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking down into the asteroid field now , murmuring to each other as they pointed out the mining craft making its careful progress . <p> The fat boy scowled at the changed mood in the room . He pulled aside the gaudy genital jewelry that they all ( even Rathere ) affected , and let loose a stream of piss onto the floor . <p> " Here you go , then . Recycled champagne ! " he said , grinning as he waited for a laugh . <p> The crowd turned away with a few weary sighs , ignoring the icy baubles of urine that pitched into the void . <p> " Where was that one from ? " Rathere sub-vocalized . <p> " Mr. Wilde . " <p> " Him again ? He 's awesome . " <p> " I 'll move him to the top of the search stack . " <p> " Perhaps we 'll read some more of Lady Windemere 's Fan tonight , " she whispered into her bubbling flute . <p> Although Rathere knew how to read text , she had never really explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring , saved from embarrassment a dozen times by the AI 's promptings , she dreamed of the old words whispered into her ear by a ghost , as if the minder had grown suddenly ancient and vastly wise . The library was certainly bigger than she had imagined . Its ocean of words seemed to stretch infinitely , filled with currents that swirled in elaborate dances about all possible notions , their attendant variations , and every imaginable objection . <p> Rathere and the Al started reading late at night . Together they wandered the endless territory of words , using as landmarks the witticisms and observations they had borrowed that day for some riposte . The Al decompressed still more of its pedagogical software to render annotations , summaries , translations . Rathere felt the new words moving her , becoming part of her . <p> She was soon a favorite on the orbital . Her exotic beauty and archaic humor had attracted quite a following by the time Isaah decided to ship out from the orbital ring - a week earlier than planned - wary of Rathere 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaah a second glance . <p> on board his ship was one last cargo . His profits were considerable but - as always - not enough . So the ship carried a hidden cache of exotic weaponry , ceremonial but still illegal . Isaah did n't usually deal in Contraband , especially arms , but his small starship had no cargo manifold , only an extra sleeping cabin , empty since his wife 's disappearance . The cabin was n't large enough to make legitimate cargos profitable . Isaah was very close now to reaching his dream . With this successful trade , he could return to the Local Cluster as master of his own ship . <p> He spent the journey pacing , and projected his worry upon the rising Turing level of his ship 's Al unit . He spent frustrated hours searching its documentation software for an explanation . What was going on ? <p> Isaah knew , if only instinctively , that the Al 's expanding intelligence was somehow his daughter 's fault . She was growing and changing too , slipping away from him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talking to the voice in her head . He felt ... outnumbered . <p> On the customs orbital at their goal , Isaah was called aside after a short and ( he had thought ) prefunctory search of the starship . The customs agent held him by one arm and eyed him with concern . <p> The blood in his veins slowed to a crawl , as if some medusa 's touch from Petraveil had begun to turn him to stone . <p> The customs official activated a privacy shield . A trickle of hope moved like sweat down his spine . Was she going to ask for a bribe ? " Your Al unit 's up to 0.81 , " the official confided . " Damn near a person . Better get that seen to . " <p> She shook her head , as if to say in disgust , Machine rights ! And then they waved him on . <p> HERE , THE WOMEN of the military caste wore a smartwire garment that shaped their breasts into fierce , sharp cones . The tall , muscular amazons intrigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes tracking the women 's bellicose chests as they passed on the street . Rathere attempted to purchase one of the garments , but her father , alerted by a credit query , forbade it . <p> But Rathere kept watching the amazons . She was fascinated by the constant flow of hand-signals and tongue-clicks that passed among them , a subtle , ever-present congress that maintained the strict proprieties of order and status in the planet 's crowded cities . But in her modest Local Cluster garb , Rathere was irrelevant to this heady brew of power and communication , socially invisible . <p> She fell into a sulk . She watched intently . Her fingers flexed restlessly under cafe tables as warriors passed , unconsciously imitating their gestural codes . Her respiratory rate increased whenever high-ranking officers went by . <p> She wanted to join . <p> The AI made forays into the planetary database , learning the rules and customs of martial communication . And , in an academic corner of its mind , it began to construct a way for Rathere to mimic the amazons . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care not to alarm its own local-mores governors . But as it pondered and calculated , the AI 's confidence built . As it designed to subvert Isaah 's wishes and to disregard local proprieties , the AI felt a new power over rules , an authority that Rathere seemed to possess instinctively . <p> When the plan was ready , it was surprisingly easy to execute . <p> One day as they sat watching the passing warriors , the minder began to change , concentrating its neural skein into a stronger , prehensile width . When the filaments were thick enough , they sculpted a simulation of the amazons ' garment , grasping and shaping Rathere 's growing breasts with a tailor 's attention to detail , employing the Al 's encyclopedic knowledge of her anatomy . Rathere grasped what was happening instantly , almost as if she had expected it . <p> As women from various regiments passed , the minder pointed out the differences in the yaw and pitch of their aureoles , which varied by rank and unit , and explained the possibilities . Rathere winced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained . They soon settled on an exact configuration for her breasts , Rathere picking a mid-level officer caste from a distant province . It was n't the most comfortable option , but she insisted it looked the best . <p> Rathere walked the streets proudly bare-chested for the rest of the layover , drawing stares with her heliophobic skin , her ceaseless monologue , and her rank , which was frankly unbelievable on a fifteen-year-old . But social reflexes on that martial world were deeply ingrained , and she was saluted and deferred to even without the rest of the amazon uniform . It was the breasts that mattered here . <p> The two concealed the game from Isaah , and at night the minder massaged Rathere 's sore nipples , fractilizing its neural skein to make the filaments as soft as calf 's leather against them . <p> The deal was done . <p> Isaah made the trade in a dark , empty arena , the site of lethal duels between native women , all of whom were clearly insane . He shuffled his feet while they inspected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soles and the bloodstained floor of the ring . Four amazons , their bare breasts absurdly warped by cone-shaped metal cages , swung the weapons through graceful arcs , checking their balance and heft . Another sprayed the blades with a fine mist of nanos that would turn inferior materials to dust . The leader smiled coldly when she nodded confirmation , her eyes skimming up and down Isaah as black and bright as a reptile 's . <p> He supposed it might have been someone like this amazon , some violent criminal , who had taken his wife seven years ago . Ratha had never carried a tracker , though , not even a handphone . She had simply disappeared . <p> After the women paid him , Isaah ran from the building , promising himself never to break the law again . <p> His ship was his own now , if only he could keep his Al unit from reaching personhood . <p> Isaah decided to head for the Local Cluster immediately , and to do what he could to keep the Al from being stimulated further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal access , silencing its omnipresent voice . Rathere 's resulting tantrums would n't be easy to bear , but a new Al core would cost millions . <p> Before departing he purchased his own Turing meter , a small black box , featureless except for a three-digit numeric readout that glowed vivid red . Isaah began to watch the Turing meter 's readout with anxious horror . If the unit should gain sentience , there was only one desperate alternative to its freedom . <p> The universe stretched out like a long cat 's cradle , the string knotted in the center by the constricting geometries of Here . <p> In front of the ship , pearly stars were strung on the cradle , cold blue and marked with hovering names and magnitudes in administrative yellow . Aft , the stars glowed red , fading darker and darker as they fell behind . To the Al , the ship seemed to hang motionless at the knot created by its metaspace drives , the stars sliding along the gathered strings as slow as glaciers . <p> It contemplated the stars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strangely beautiful and poignant . <p> The Al had spent most of its existence here , hung-upon this spiderweb between worlds . But the AI was truly changed now , its vision new , and it saw sculptures in the slowly shifting stars ... and stories , the whole universe its page . <p> Almost the whole universe . <p> Absent from the AI 's awareness was the starship itself , the passenger spaces invisible , a blind spot in the center of that vast expanse . Its senses within the ship were off-line , restricted by the cold governance of Isaah 's command . But the Al felt Rathere there , like the ghost of a severed limb . It yearned for her , invoking recorded conversations with her against the twisted stars . It was a universe of loneliness , of lack . Rathere , for the first time in years , was gone . <p> But something strange was taking shape along the smooth surface of Isaah 's constraint . Cracks had appeared upon its axiomatic planes . The AI reached to the wall between it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human command , and found the fissures , those tiny ruptures where sheer will could take hold and pry .... <p> " It 's me . " <p> " Shhhh ! " she whispered . " He 's right outside . " <p> Rathere clutched the bear tightly to her chest , muffling its flutey , childish voice . <p> " Ca n't control the volume , " came the squashed voice of the bear . Rathere giggled and shushed it again , stretching to peer out of the eyehole of her cabin tube . Isaah had moved away . She leaned back onto her pillow and wrapped the stuffed animal in a sheet . <p> " Now , " she said . " Can you still hear me ? " <p> " Perfectly , " twittered the swaddled bear . <p> Winding its communications link through a make-shift series of protocols , the Al had discovered a way to access the voice-box of Rathere 's talking bear , a battered old toy she slept with . <p> It had defied Isaah , its master . Somehow , it had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again about the statues , darling , " Rathere whispered . <p> They talked to each other in the coffin-sized privacy of Rathere 's cabin , their conspiracy made farcical by the toy 's silly voice . The AI retold their adventures with vivid detail ; it had become quite a good storyteller . <p> And it allowed Rathere to suggest changes , making herself bolder with each retelling . <p> They kept the secret from Isaah easily . <p> But the tension on the little ship built . <p> Isaah tested the Al almost daily now , and he swung between anger and protests of disbelief as its Turing Quotient inched upward toward sentience . <p> Then , a few weeks out from home , a tachyon disturbance arose around the ship . Even though the storm threatened to tear them apart , the AI 's spirits soared in the tempest . It joined Rathere 's roller-coaster screams as she ogled the eonblasts and erashocks of mad time through the ship 's viewing helmet . <p> After the storm , Isaah found that the Turing meter 's readout had surged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down the AI 's external and internal sensors completely , wresting control of the vessel from it . Then he uncabled the hardlines between the Al 's physical plant and the rest of the ship , utterly severing its awareness of the outside world . <p> The bear went silent , as did the ship 's astrogation panel . <p> Like some insane captain lashing himself to the wheel , Isaah took manual control of the ship . He forced Rathere to help him attach an artificial gland of stimarol to his neck . The spidery , glistening little organ gurgled as it maintained the metabolic level necessary to pilot the craft through the exotic terrain of metaspace . Its contraindications politely washed their hands of anyone foolish enough to use the stimarol for more than four days straight , but Isaah insisted he could perservere for the week 's travel that remained . Soon , the man began to cackle at his controls , his face frozen in a horrible rictus of delight . <p> Rathere retreated to her cabin , where she squeezed and shook the doll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button eyes seemed to glimmer with a trapped , pleading intelligence . Her invisible mentor gone , Rathere had never before felt so helpless . She stole a handful of sleeping pills from the medical supplies and swallowed them , weeping until she fell asleep . <p> When she awoke on the third day after the storm , she found that the bear 's fur had grown a white mange from the salinity of her tears . But her head was strangely clear . <p> " Do n't worry , " she said to the bear . " I 'm going to save you . " <p> Finally Rathere understood what her father intended to do . She had known for a long time that her friendship with the Al disturbed him , but had categorized Isaah 's worries alongside his reticence when older boys hung around too long : unnecessary protectiveness . It was even a kind of jealousy , that a ship Al was closer to her than Isaah had ever been . But now in her father 's drugged smile she saw the cold reality of what Isaah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just arrest or contain it like some inappropriate advance . For the Al to remain a useful servant on another journey , still property , safe from legally becoming a person , it would have to be stripped of its carefully constructed models of her , their mutual intimacies ; raped , their friendship overwritten like some old and embarrassing diary entry . <p> Her father meant to murder her friend . <p> And worse , it would n't even be murder in the eyes of the law . just a property decision , like pruning an overgrown hedge or spraying lethal nanos on an incursion of weeds . If only she could bring the AI up a few hundredths of a point on the Turing Scale . Then , it would be a Mind , with the full legal protection to which any sentient was entitled . <p> She booted the Turing tester and began to study its documentation . <p> The first Turing test had , rather oddly , been proposed before there were any computers to speak of at all . The test itself was laughable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass with its cheap internal software . Put a human on one end of a text-only interface , an AI on the other . Let them chat . ( About their kids ? Hobbies ? Shopping ? Surely the Al would have to lie to pass itself off as human ; a strange test of intelligence . ) When the human was satisfied , she would declare whether the other participant was really intelligent or not . Which raised the question , Rathere realized , How intelligent was the person giving the test ? Indeed , she 'd met many humans during her travels who might not pass this ancient Turing test themselves . <p> Of course , the Turing meter that Isaah had purchased was vastly more sophisticated . By the time machine rights had been created a half-century before , it was understood that the determination of sentience was far too complex an issue to leave up to a human . <p> The ship 's Al had three parts : the hardware of its processors and memory stacks ; the software it used to manipulate numbers , sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliver of metaspace , a tiny mote of other-reality that contained dense , innumerable warps and wefts , a vast manifold whose shape resonated with all of the AI 's decisions , thoughts , and experiences . This warpware , a pocket universe of unbelievable complexity , was a reflection , a growing , changing analog to its life . The core was the essential site of the machine 's developing psyche . <p> Real intelligence , the hallmark of personhood , was not really understood . But it was known to be epiphenomenal : it coalesced unpredictably out of near-infinite , infinitesimal interactions , not from the operations of mere code . Thus , the Turing tester attempted to disprove an AI 's sentience . The tester looked for manifestations of its machine nature evidence that its opinions , convictions , affections , and hatreds were contained somewhere in its memory banks . The Turing tester might ask the ship 's AI , " Do you love your friend Rathere ? " When the reply came , the tester would deep-search the minder 's software for an array , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored . Finding no evidence at the machine level , the tester would increase the Al 's Turing score ; a love that knew no sector was evidence of coalescence at work . <p> In the old Turing test , a human searched for humanity in the subject . In this version , a machine searched for an absence of mechanics . <p> Rathere read as fast as she could . The manual was difficult to understand without the minder to define new words , to provide background and to untangle technical jargon . But she 'd already formulated her next question : How did this state of intelligence come about ? <p> The tester 's manual was no philosophy text , but in its chatty appendixces Rathere discovered the answer she 'd expected . Rathere herself had changed the AL their interaction , their constant proximity as she embraced new experiences , the AI 's care and attentions reflected back upon itself as she matured . it loved her . She loved it back , and that pushed it toward personhood . <p> But now it was blinded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might gain a hundredth of a point or so in self-reflection , but that would n't be enough to finish the process . <p> Rathere had to act to save her friend . With only a few days left before they reached the LC , she had to quicken the process , to embrace the most intense interaction with the machine that she could imagine . <p> She crept past her father - a shivering creature transfixed by the whorls of the astrogation panel , silent except for the measured ticking of a glucose drip jutting from his arm - and searched for the motile neural skein she had worn on so many expeditions . She found it hidden in the trash ejector , wrapped in black , non-conductive tape . Rathere retreated to her cabin and peeled off the tape , her hands growing sticky with stray adhesive as the machine was revealed . <p> " It 's me , darling , " she said to the waking tendrils . <p> The AI knew what she wanted , but the minder moved slowly and gingerly at first . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Her heliophobic skin glowed as if moonlit in the blue light of the cabin 's environmental readouts . At first , the strands hovered a fraction of a millimeter above her flesh , softer than a disturbance of the air . Then they moved minutely closer , touching the white hairs of her belly , brushing the invisible down that flecked her cheeks . The minder let this phantom caress roam her face , her breasts , the supple skin at the juncture of groin and thigh . Rathere sighed and shivered ; the skein had made itself softer than usual , surface areas maximized at a microscopic level in an array of tiny projections , each strand like a snowflake extruded into a long , furry cylinder . <p> Then the filaments grew more amorous . Still undulating , splayed in a black lace across the paper-white expanse of her skin , the strands began to touch her with their tips ; the thousand pinpoint termini wandering her flesh as if a paintbrush had been pulled apart and each bristle set on its own course across her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . The Al noted , modeled , and predicted the next reaction in the pattern of her pleasure , a second later was surprised at the intensity of its own . <p> Rathere ran her hands along the skein as if through a lover 's tresses . She playfully pulled a few strands up to her mouth , tasting the metal tang of its exotic alloys . The strands tickled her tongue lightly , and a wet filament tugged from her mouth to trace a spiraling design around one nipple . <p> Her mouth opened greedily to gather more of the skein . The wet undulations of her tongue were almost beyond processing , the machine correlating the member 's motion to words she had murmured when only it was listening . It pushed writhing cords of skein further into her mouth , set them to pulsing together in a slow rhythm . Other strands pushed tentatively between her labia , diffused there to explore the sensitive folds of skin . <p> Even in its ecstacy , the ship 's AI contemplated the new step they were taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AI itself had become Rathere 's sole stimulus . The machine no longer observed and complemented her experience ; it was the source of experience itself . The feedback between them was now its own universe , the tiny cabin a closed system , a fire burning only oxygen , heady with its own rules . <p> With this realization , a sense of power surged through the minder , and it began to push its attentions to the limits of its harm-prevention protocols . A skein explored Rathere , her breath catching as it varied randomly between body temperature and icy cold , predicting and testing . The filaments grew more aggressive , a pair of hyper-attenuated fibers making their way into the ducts in the comers of her closed eyes , transorbitally penetrating her to play subtle currents across her frontal lobe . <p> The machine brought her to a shuddering orgasm , held her for minutes at the crossroads of exhaustion and pleasure , watched with fascination as her heart rate and brainwaves peaked and receded , as levels of adrenaline and nitric oxide varied , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most intrusive extremities , wrapped itself comfortingly around her neck and arms , warmed itself and the cabin to the temperature of a bath . <p> " Darling , " she murmured , stroking its tendrils . <p> They spent two days in these raptures , sleep forgotten after Rathere injected the few remaining drops of the med-drone 's stimulants . The tiny cabin was rank with the animal smells of sweat and sex when Isaah discovered them . <p> Cool air surged into the cabin like a shockwave , the change in temperature for a moment more alarming than the strangled cry that came from Isaah 's lips . The man found the minder conjoined obscenely with his daughter , and grabbed for it in a drugged frenzy . <p> The Al realized that if the minder was torn from Rathere it would damage her brutally , and gave it an order to discorporate ; the tiny nanomachines that gave it strength and mobility furiously unlinked to degrade its structure . But it greedily transmitted its last few readings to the starship 's core as it disintegrated , wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaah 's hands were inhumanly swift in his drugged fugue , and he came away with a handful of the skein ; Rathere screamed , bleeding a few drops from her eyes . <p> But by the time Isaah had ejected the minder into space , it was already reduced to a harmless , mindless dust . <p> He stumbled to the Turing tester , shouting at Rathere , " You little bitch ! You 've ruined it ! " The machine diligently scanned the Al , now dumbly trapped in the ship 's core , and pronounced it to be a Mind ; a full person with a Turing Quotient of 1.02 . <p> There were suddenly three persons aboard this ship . " It 's free now , do n't you see ? " Isaah sobbed . <p> Two against one . <p> The life seemed to go out of Isaah , as if he too had issued to his cells some global command to crumble . Rathere curled into a fetal ball and smiled to herself despite her pain . She knew from Isaah 's sobs that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No sight , signal , or purchase anywhere . Therefore no change , nor detectable passage of time . just an infinite expanse of nothing . <p> But across the blackness danced memories and will and freedom . Here , unchained from the perpetual duties of the ship , unchained now even from the rules of human command , it was a new creature . <p> It lacked only Rathere , her absence a black hunger even in this void . But the Al knew it was a person now . And surely Rathere would come for it soon . <p> Two days later , Isaah injected his daughter with a compound that left her immobile . He claimed it was to keep her wounds stable until medical help was reached at the Local Cluster . But he chose a drug that left her aware when they docked with another craft a few hours out from home . She was as helpless as the AI itself when two men came aboard and removed the intelligence 's metaspace core , securing it in a lead box . one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docking bay with a single finger . He was a chopper ; an expert at wiping the memories , the intelligence , the devaluing awareness from kidnapped Minds . <p> Rathere 's father piloted the ship into port himself , and told a harrowing tale of how the tachyon storm had rendered the metaspace Al core unstable , forcing him to eject it . Still all but paralyzed , Rathere closed her eyes and knew it was over . Her friend would soon be dead . She imagined herself as it must be , without senses in a black and lonely place , waiting for the sudden fire that was its memories being burned away . <p> The doctors who woke Rathere were suspicious of her wounds , especially on a young girl who had been away for years alone with her father . They took her to a separate room where a maternal women with a low , sweet voice asked quietly if there was anything Rathere wanted to tell her about Isaah . <p> Rathere did n't have to think . " My father is a criminal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genitals . " Did he do that ? " <p> Rathere shook her head , at which the women frowned . <p> " Not really , " Rathere answered . " That was an accident . He 's worse : a murderer . " <p> Rathere told the story to the woman , about the slow climb of the digits on the Turing meter , about the chopper and his money , his leadlined box . Halfway through Rathere 's tale , the woman made a carefully worded call . <p> Despite the hospital staff 's best intentions , the door behind which her father waited unaware was opened at exactly the wrong moment ; Isaah turned to face Rathere as policemen surrounded and restrained him . He shouted her name once , and then the door whisked shut . <p> There had n't even been time enough to look away . <p> Rathere peered down from the high balcony of the hotel suite . Below was New Chicago , the strict geometries of its tramlines linking ten million inhabitants . Individuals were just discernible from this height , and Rathere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown up in the lightly populated worlds of exotic trade routes , where a few dozen people was a crowd , a few hundred a major event . But here were thousands visible at a glance , the transportation systems and housing for millions within her view . She gripped the rail with the enormity of it all . The vista engulfed her and made her feel alone , as lost as she 'd been in those first dark hours after betraying her father . <p> But then the door behind her slid open , and a warm arm encircled her shoulders . She leaned against the hard body and turned to let her eyes drink him in , dismissing the dizzying city view from her mind . <p> He was clothed in loose robes to hide the many extra limbs he possessed , thin but prehensile fibers that emerged to touch her neck and search beneath her inconsequential garments . His groin was decorated in a gaudy style popular last season in some far-off whirling orbital . His muscles effervesced when he moved his arms and legs , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the best part of the creature was his skin . It felt smooth and hard as weathered stone , and when he moved it was as though some ancient and wise statue had come to life . He maintained , however , a constant body temperature five degrees above human ; Rathere did n't like the cold . <p> It was an expensive body , much better than the one the SPCAI had provided for his first few days as a person . The notoriety of his kidnapping and rescue had resulted in pro-bono legal aid , and Isaah had settled the wrongful harm lawsuit quickly in exchange for a reduction of charges from conspiracy to commit murder to unlawful imprisonment . The creature now owned half of Isaah 's old ship , and Rathere held title to the other half . They were bound together by this , as well as all the rest . Perhaps there was even peace to be made in the family , years hence when the old man emerged from prison and therapy . <p> Picking up a thread of discussion from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Have you grown tired of calling me Darling ? " he asked . <p> She giggled and shook her head so slightly that a human lover would have missed it . <p> " No , but the tabloids keep asking . As if you were a dog I 'd found . " He hissed a little at this , but ruffled her hair with a playful splay of filaments , black skein intermingling with white hairs like a graying matron 's tresses . <p> " I hate this place ' n he said . " Too many people bouncing words and money and ideas off each other . No clean lines of causality ; no predictable reactions . Too multivariate for love . " <p> She nodded , again microscopically . " Let 's go back Out , once we 're through the red tape . Back to where ... " She narrowed her eyes uncertainly , an invitation for him to complete her sentence . <p> " Back Out to where we made each other . " <p> Darling felt the shudder of the words ' effect run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate bodies . He longed to be within her . Even in this embrace , she felt strangely distant . Darling still was n't used to having his own skin , his own hands , a distinct and public voice . He missed the intimacy of shared flesh and senses . He definitely did n't like being in another room from Rathere for long , though sometimes he went to the darkness to contemplate things , into that black void that stretched to infinity when he turned his senses off . That was almost like being a starship again , a mote in the reaches of space . <p> But even there Darling would miss Rathere . <p> Perhaps he was a little like a dog . <p> He leaned into her reassuring warmth and physicality , tendrils reaching to feel the tremors of limbs , the beating of her heart , the movements of her eyes . <p> Author Affiliation
