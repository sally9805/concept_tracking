Quicksilver Volume One of The Baroque Cycle The Baroque Cycle v. 1 : Quicksilver Book 1 : Quicksilver Those who assume hypotheses as first principles of their speculations . . . may indeed form an ingenious romance , but a romance it will still be .  --  Roger Cotes , preface to Sir Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica , second edition , 1713 Boston Common October 12 , 1713 , 10:33:52 a.m . Enoch rounds the corner just as the executioner raises the noose above the woman 's head . The crowd on the Common stop praying and sobbing for just as long as Jack Ketch stands there , elbows locked , for all the world like a carpenter heaving a ridge-beam into place . The rope clutches a disk of blue New England sky . The Puritans gaze at it and , to all appearances , think . Enoch the Red reins in his borrowed horse as it nears the edge of the crowd , and sees that the executioner 's purpose is not to let them inspect his knotwork , but to give them all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of the portal through which they all must pass one day . Boston 's a dollop of hills in a spoon of marshes . The road up the spoon-handle is barred by a wall , with the usual gallows outside of it , and victims , or parts of them , strung up or nailed to the city gates . Enoch has just come that way , and reckoned he had seen the last of such things  --  that thenceforth it would all be churches and taverns . But the dead men outside the gate were common robbers , killed for earthly crimes . What is happening now in the Common is of a more Sacramental nature . The noose lies on the woman 's grey head like a crown . The executioner pushes it down . Her head forces it open like an infant 's dilating the birth canal . When it finds the widest part it drops suddenly onto her shoulders . Her knees pimple the front of her apron and her skirts telescope into the platform as she makes to collapse . The executioner hugs her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright , and adjusts the knot while an official reads the death warrant . This is as bland as a lease . The crowd scratches and shuffles . There are none of the diversions of a London hanging : no catcalls , jugglers , or pickpockets . Down at the other end of the Common , a squadron of lobsterbacks drills and marches round the base of a hummock with a stone powder-house planted in its top . An Irish sergeant bellows  --  bored but indignant  --  in a voice that carries forever on the wind , like the smell of smoke . He 's not come to watch witch-hangings , but now that Enoch 's blundered into one it would be bad form to leave . There is a drum-roll , and then a sudden awkward silence . He judges it very far from the worst hanging he 's ever seen  --  no kicking or writhing , no breaking of ropes or unraveling of knots  --  all in all , an unusually competent piece of work . He had n't really known what to expect of America . But people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blunt , blank efficiency that 's admirable and disappointing at the same time . Like jumping fish , they go about difficult matters with bloodless ease . As if they were all born knowing things that other people must absorb , along with faery-tales and superstitions , from their families and villages . Maybe it is because most of them came over on ships . As they are cutting the limp witch down , a gust tumbles over the Common from the North . On Sir Isaac Newton 's temperature scale , where freezing is zero and the heat of the human body is twelve , it is probably four or five . If Herr Fahrenheit were here with one of his new quicksilver-filled , sealed-tube thermometers , he would probably observe something in the fifties . But this sort of wind , coming as it does from the North , in the autumn , is more chilling than any mere instrument can tell . It reminds everyone here that , if they do n't want to be dead in a few months ' time , they have firewood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hoarse preacher at the base of the gallows , who takes it to be Satan himself , come to carry the witch 's soul to hell , and who is not slow to share this opinion with his flock . The preacher is staring Enoch in the eye as he testifies . Enoch feels the heightened , chafing self-consciousness that is the precursor to fear . What 's to prevent them from trying and hanging him as a witch ? How must he look to these people ? A man of indefinable age but evidently broad experience , with silver hair queued down to the small of his back , a copper-red beard , pale gray eyes , and skin weathered and marred like a blacksmith 's ox-hide apron . Dressed in a long traveling-cloak , a walking-staff and an outmoded rapier strapped ' longside the saddle of a notably fine black horse . Two pistols in his waistband , prominent enough that Indians , highwaymen , and French raiders can clearly see them from ambuscades ( he 'd like to move them out of view , but reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Saddlebags ( should they be searched ) filled with instruments , asks of quicksilver and stranger matters  --  some , as they 'd learn , quite dangerous  --  books in Hebrew , Greek , and Latin pocked with the occult symbols of Alchemists and Kabalists . Things could go badly for him in Boston . But the crowd takes the preacher 's ranting not as a call to arms but a signal to turn and disperse , muttering . The redcoats discharge their muskets with deep hissing booms , like handfuls of sand hurled against a kettledrum . Enoch dismounts into the midst of the colonists . He sweeps the robe round him , concealing the pistols , pulls the hood back from his head , and amounts to just another weary pilgrim . He does not meet any man 's eye but scans their faces sidelong , and is surprised by a general lack of self-righteousness . " God willing , " one man says , " that 'll be the last one . " " Do you mean , sir , the last witch ? " Enoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging . " Flowing like water round the bases of the steep hills , they migrate across a burying ground on the south edge of the common , already full of lost Englishmen , and follow the witch 's corpse down the street . The houses are mostly of wood , and so are the churches . Spaniards would have built a single great cathedral here , of stone , with gold on the inside , but the colonists can not agree on anything and so it is more like Amsterdam : small churches on every block , some barely distinguishable from barns , each no doubt preaching that all of the others have it wrong . But at least they can muster a consensus to kill a witch . She is borne into a new burying ground , which for some reason they have situated hard by the granary . Enoch is at a loss to know whether this juxtaposition  --  that is , storing their Dead , and their Staff of Life , in the same place  --  is some sort of Message from the city 's elders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one city burn , recognizes the scars of a great fire along this main street . Houses and churches are being rebuilt with brick or stone . He comes to what must be the greatest intersection in the town , where this road from the city gate crosses a very broad street that runs straight down to salt water , and continues on a long wharf that projects far out into the harbor , thrusting across a ruined rampart of stones and logs : the rubble of a disused sea-wall . The long wharf is ridged with barracks . It reaches far enough out into the harbor that one of the Navy 's very largest men-of-war is able to moor at its end . Turning his head the other way he sees artillery mounted up on a hillside , and blue-coated gunners tending to a vatlike mortar , ready to lob iron bombs onto the decks of any French or Spanish galleons that might trespass on the bay . So , drawing a mental line from the dead criminals at the city gate , to the powderhouse on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor defenses , he has got one Cartesian number-line  --  what Leibniz would call the Ordinate  --  plotted out : he understands what people are afraid of in Boston , and how the churchmen and the generals keep the place in hand . But it remains to be seen what can be plotted in the space above and below . The hills of Boston are skirted by endless flat marshes that fade , slow as twilight , into Harbor or River , providing blank empty planes on which men with ropes and rulers can construct whatever strange curves they phant'sy . Enoch knows where to find the Origin of this coordinate system , because he has talked to ship 's masters who have visited Boston . He goes down to where the long wharf grips the shore . Among fine stone sea-merchants ' houses , there is a brick-red door with a bunch of grapes dangling above it . Enoch goes through that door and finds himself in a good tavern . Men with swords and expensive clothes turn round to look at him . Slavers , merchants of rum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships that carry those things . It could be any place in the world , for the same tavern is in London , Cadiz , Smyrna and Manila , and the same men are in it . None of them cares , supposing they even know , that witches are being hanged five minutes ' walk away . He is much more comfortable in here than out there ; but he has not come to be comfortable . The particular sea-captain he 's looking for  --  van Hoek  --  is not here . He backs out before the tavern keeper can tempt him . Back in America and among Puritans , he enters into narrower streets , and heads north , leading his horse over a rickety wooden bridge thrown over a little mill-creek . Flotillas of shavings from some carpenter 's block-plane sail down the stream like ships going off to war . Underneath them the weak current nudges turds and bits of slaughtered animals down towards the harbor . It smells accordingly . No denying there is a tallow chandlery not far upwind , where beast-grease not fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
