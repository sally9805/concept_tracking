Superhuman endurance at Luding Bridge and the Great Snowy Mountains came to symbolize Mao Tse-tung 's Long March . // The enemy approaches , we retreat . The enemy halts , we move in . The enemy tires , we attack . The enemy retreats , we pursue . - Mao Tse-Tung , On Guerrilla Warfare October 16 , 1934 , was a beautiful moonlit night in Jiangxi province in southeast China . Beautiful to anyone except Mao Tse-tung and the 86,859 men and women of the Chinese Communist First Front Army . Because the Communists possessed neither artillery nor airplanes , they knew they were vulnerably exposed . Covering their heads with bunches of leaves to camouflage themselves , they began marching west . As the Communists began their trek , their slow-moving column stretched to more than 60 miles in length and was weighed down by supplies accumulated during their previous sedentary period in a Soviet base area . Groups of porters lugged along everything from X-ray machines to printing presses . Nearly all of this would soon be abandoned . But more important , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about 6,000 miles , in Shaanxi province in north-central China about a year and eight months later , only some 4,000 weary and battle-scarred veterans of this original force would remain . Through the course of those 20 months , Mao-a voracious reader and a man of incredibly wide-ranging intellectual interests-would succeed in introducing to the world a revolutionary new military and political paradigm . At the beginning of the march , Mao was not in the front rank of leadership . he had been excluded from military decisionmaking two years earlier , largely through political intrigue . Instead , German military adviser Otto Braun had been sent by the Russian Communist International , or Comintern . The Chinese Communist with whom he shared command , Bo Gu , was a man who almost invariably agreed with Brauns military advice . Two primary questions had occupied the leadership of the nascent Chinese Communist movement . The first , whether the revolution in China would follow the Russian model and be born in an insurrection of the urban proletariat , had already been decided in 1925 , when General Chiang Kai-shek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crushed the Shanghai uprising . Still , deeply ingrained ideas often die a slow death , and this idea continued to receive support for some time , especially from Josef Stalin and his agent , Braun . The second question , whether the vastly outnumbered Red Army should establish static base areas and use conventional tactics to engage Chiang 's Nationalists , was in the process of being decided once and for all . // Chinese Communists cross Ai-Hung-Hsin in the Great Snowy Mountains during the 1934-36 fighting retreat from General Chiang Kai-shek 's Kuomintang , or Nationalist army , that came to be known as the Long March ( Snark/Art Resource , N.Y. ) . // Chinese Communists cross Ai-Hung-Hsin in the Great Snowy Mountains during the 1934-36 fighting retreat from General Chiang Kai-shek 's Kuomintang , or Nationalist army , that came to be known as the Long March ( Snark/Art Resource , NY . // Previously the Chinese Communists had set up their base of operations in rural Jiangxi . This province was still largely undeveloped and had few if any established roads . Instead , transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population for millennia . Chiang , following the advice of his own German military adviser , General Hans von seeckt ( provided by Adolf Hitler ) , had built ring upon ring of stone and concrete blockhouses . Eventually more than 14,000 of these small forts were constructed . They were usually placed beside footpaths in order to control trade , and once the population had been brought under military control , another ring of blockhouses would be built , often within sight of the last . With his encirclement campaigns , Chiang was slowly strangling and starving the Soviet base area . Braun , following the prevailing military orthodoxy of the day , began building blockhouses of his own and issued a wildly inflexible directive-not one inch of territory was to be surrendered . The results were disastrous for the Communists : During the Fifth Encirclement Campaign , as it was known , the Red Army lost 60,000 men , with little , if anything , to show for its sacrifice . Original in thought and action , Mao seems to have learned from that campaign . he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his revolutionary new tactics were clearly visible . They were characterized by hit-and-run attacks , and by drawing Nationalist troops deep into Red territory , where they would be cut to pieces in deadly ambushes . Set-piece battles were avoided whenever possible . Eventually , though , Mao 's 1927 Autumn Harvest Uprising sputtered out under the weight of attrition , leaving him with a band of perhaps 1,000 men with whom he retreated to a stronghold high in the Jinggang Mountains . // Men and women of Mao Tse-tung 's First Front Army prepare for company at a way station on the Long March , in a propaganda painting by an unknown Chinese artist . When the enemy force became overwhelming , the Communists would slip away and move on . // Mao 's tactics ran counter to Marxist doctrine in several important ways . As a result , he was said to be little more than a bandit chief who relied more on the gun than on Karl Marx 's Das Kapital . Braun , though he himself had led the Red Army through a year marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao 's ideas but also his successes . Nonetheless , it was obvious that if the Red Army stayed where it was , it would face annihilation . It was imperative to break out from Chiangs and von seeckt 's stranglehold . Over the following months , many inessentials were discarded along the way-often when the Red Army was caught in the vulnerable position of making river crossings . Then the supply train would be lightened until the troops often moved at a jogging pace , regularly covering 20 , 30 , even 40 miles a day . Obviously , Mao 's tactics produced results , so that he was eventually recognized as the Communists ' true leader , and Braun was relegated to little more than observer status . The Red Army slogged on west and eventually north , tracing a path that looked somewhat like a large scraggly C. The Long March became essentially a rite of passage , a series of hardships and dangers , a triumph of human survival , punctuated by battle after battle that came within a hair 's breadth of utter disaster . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemies again and again . His troops would strike at the Nationalists ' rear with lightning speed , then disappear down some forest path as quickly as they had appeared . In one sense , the Long March resembled to a degree the campaigns of Alexander , or Napoleons march on Moscow-its essence was its whole rather than a singular event . Nonetheless , two events that occurred near the end of the march have come to be identified as some of the most dramatic and emblematic of this entire odyssey . The Dadu River comes crashing out of the Himalayas in the remote northwest province of Qinghai and flows almost due south before turning abruptly to the east . It roars with great speed between jagged black cliffs , and in 1935 there was only one means of crossing it on foot-the Luding Bridge . Originally , Mao 's plan was not to cross the Dadu at that point , but farther south at the village of Anshunchang , where he hoped to use local boats to quickly ferry his troops to the north side of the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early hours of May 24 , 1935 . It was a rainy morning , and the 1st Company of the 1st Regiment , commanded by Yang Dezhi , proceeded down a slick and muddy path to the village , which they quickly captured . They found only one boat on the river 's banks , but in it Commander Yang sent 17 volunteers across the river . The crossing was rigorous , and it demanded great effort to successfully negotiate the Dadu 's swift current . Photograph Mao addresses a conference at the new Communist base in Shaanxi province in 1936 . Seated behind him are , from left , Chu Teh , Chou Enlai and Qin Banxia. // Even though two more boats were found on the opposite bank , it was obvious that the entire Red Army would not be able to cross by boat . Mao ordered that the boats be used 24 hours a day , and in the meantime called a meeting of his senior commanders . Typically for Mao , he chose an equally unexpected and almost equally difficult solution . The 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed to proceed approximately 90 miles up the near bank of the Dadti along an almost nonexistent path and capture the Luding Bridge . The path wound tortuously along the rivers sheer cliffs , but it was the only route available . Farther west , the peaks of the Great Snowy Mountains jutted 20,000 feet skyward . Commissar Yang was given three days to reach his goal ; if he did not succeed before the KMT had a chance to reinforce the bridge , the entire Red Army stood in danger of destruction . The regiment started out just after midnight on May 27 . Often there was no real path , and toeholds had to be cut as the men inched their way along , clinging to the mountain face several hundred feet above the river . At points the gorge was so narrow they were clearly visible from the opposite bank , and would occasionally draw enemy fire . Within 16 miles of starting out , the 4th Regiment encountered a company of about 100 Nationalist troops , whom they routed , then chased up one mountain and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a small swift tributary . Commissar Yang and his men cut down some trees and built an improvised log bridge before continuing on . Pushing on , the Communists encountered the KMT 24th Division , dug in and blocking their way . Yang then sent a small advance party around and over an adjacent mountain , which attacked the Nationalist force from the rear and defeated it . By nightfall the shock troops had covered about 25 miles of mountain terrain and engaged in two battles . They settled down for several hours ' rest . By 5 a.m. the 4th Shock Regiment was again on the move , but after a couple of miles a courier sprinted up and delivered new orders : Yang and his men were to take the Luding Bridge by the 29th instead of the 30th . Having covered 25 miles in the first day while fighting running battles , they now were expected to cover 70 miles more , as well as capture the bridge , in their single remaining day ! Impossible ... but as Commissar Yang laconically announced , " Orders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent up Fierce Tiger Mountain as rolling fog closed in around them . Those fast-moving mountain clouds proved to be an asset when Yang 's men ran into another KMT battalion dug in on Fierce Tiger 's summit . Blanketed by fog , the Communists managed to approach unobserved before hurling grenades and finally charging with bayonets . The KMT fled , and Yang and his men continned the 10 miles down the other side of the mountain . By 6 p.m. the 4th Regiment had 35 miles to go before reaching the Luding Bridge . The fog and drizzle made the path slippery , but at least there was no sign of the enemy . The Communists took no supper break ; instead they munched a cold mouthful of rice and kept pressing forward as darkness fell . By 11 p.m. they began to catch glimpses of torches on the other side of the narrow gorge . Peering across , Yang saw a KMT battalion marching in the same direction as his force , no doubt called up to reinforce the Luding Bridge . Time to unleash his secret weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recently captured . Yang instructed his bugler to call out that they , too , were KMT in pursuit of Red bandits . A moment later Chiang 's forces replied in kind . The two columns marched side by side on opposite banks of the gorge 's sharp , vertical V for some 10 miles before the real KMT troops settled down for the night . Yang and his men continued on .

Along the way , the exhausted men abandoned everything they had been carrying except weapons and ammunition . With first light , the Communists began jogging again , guns in hand . By dawn , they had miraculously succeeded in reaching the approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town of Luding leading to the river . On either side were bridge houses , enamel-painted and topped by pagoda roofs covered with tiles of imperial red . Between them , stretching a span of 370 feet , were 13 chains that made up the Luding Bridge . The links were large and thick , and had been made of hand-smelted iron .

To his horror , he saw that the KMT had removed the planks that normally covered the bridge . Now , for two-thirds of the span , the bare chains perilously swayed , like some great hammock , over the Dadu . The rivers turbulent waters swirled and crashed below , leaping-as the local people described it-like dragons trying to pull men into their icy depths . Yet there was no other choice . The nine bare chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be crossed . Anyone who attempted it would have to do it by crawling and pulling himself along a tenuous , swinging cobweb . Commissar Yang gave the signal , and he and his men descended into the town , where they quickly defeated the handful of KMT troops that had been left on his side of the gorge . They then ducked into a small Catholic church not far from the bridge and made their final preparations . Peering across the river once again , Yang observed a much larger force of several hundred men on the other side . The task would be difficult enough as it was , but if he and his shock troops hesitated and the reinforcements they had seen the night before arrived , it would become impossible . Commissar Yang believed that men fight best on a full stomach , and so ordered his cooks to prepare a hasty but fortifying meal . In the meantime , he explained his plan and gave a small pep talk . By then the KMT had been alerted , and began lobbing mortars over the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists . At 4 p.m . Yang gave the signal . The Communists , having no artillery or mortars of their own , returned fire with heavy machine guns that had been set on an elevation just behind the bridge . Variously dispersed riflemen also contributed to the covering fire . // A sketch of the Luding Bridge by Huang Zhen , a participant in its seizure who produced the only pictorial record of the crossing and later became a leading diplomat . // Buglers sounded the call to " Charge ! " and the 22 men of the 2nd Company , led by Liao Dashu , dashed forward for the assault . Each man carried a submachine gun or a pistol , a broadsword and a dozen hand grenades . They began crawling out onto the swaying chains , inching their way link by link across the river , while the KMT had opened fire on the suicidally exposed men . Men of the 3rd Company crawled behind the 2nd Company and began laying planks , preparing the way for reinforcements . In the meantime , the troops of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above the turbulent river . By now the sun had risen over the mountain ridges , and sweat poured from their faces and made their hands slippery from fear and exertion . Just when it seemed that the situation could not be any worse , Yang and his men saw flames billowing up from the bridge house on the opposite bank . The KMT had poured kerosene on the old wood and set it ablaze ! There was no other choice , though , but to push on through it . The men of the 2nd Company grasped their way forward ; as one and then another of their comrades was hit , he would drop from the chains and disappear beneath the river 's foam . Finally , the survivors clambered onto the remaining flooring of the bridge , opened up with their submachine guns and charged into the smoke and flames of the bridge house . Emerging on the other side , clothes afire and faces blackened , they found the remaining KMT had fled . Two hours of mopping-up and the Luding Bridge was securely in Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the attack , 18 not only survived but also came through virtually unscathed . The Communists discovered that the cartridges the BCMT used had been moldy . Many KMT bullets fired never reached their intended targets . When Mao arrived several days later , he made his way to the middle of the swaying bridge and gazed down into the swirling waters of the Dadu . Like many men who have fought their way into power and history , he had managed to cheat death once again . For their efforts , Mao awarded his men new tunics , notebooks , enamel pans and pairs of chopsticks . Both Commander Yang and his men claimed they valued these rewards far more highly than gold medals-not surprising , considering what they had been through . Once across the Dadu , Mao and his men were temporarily out of danger from the KMT . Mao knew that Zhang Guotaos Communist Fourth Front Army lay somewhere ahead , but its precise whereabouts remained a mystery . Radio contact between the two armies had been ruled out because a code book had been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could end up revealing the positions of both Communist armies . Mao was faced with three possible routes . The first , which proceeded the farthest west , was a well-traveled caravan route to circumvent the Great Snowy Mountains . Its disadvantage was that it was long and passed through territory densely populated with Tibetans , who were traditionally hostile to the Han Chinese . The second route swept out in a curve to the east , but this would dramatically increase Mao 's exposure to the KMT forces . The third and last option led through the Great Snowy Mountains . This route was very difficult . The pass they had to cross rose 14,000 feet , and was creased by a small trail used by locals . For Mao the choice was clear : When in doubt , take the small back trail , move quickly and arouse as little attention as possible . At that point , the best estimates are that , of the 86,000 men who had started out on the Long March eight months before , perhaps 12,000 or 13,000 remained . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the route on the map was doubled if not tripled . Rarely did they march in a straight line , and often the able-bodied would be required to return to help the wounded across difficult stretches . Nowhere would this prove more taxing than in the Great Snowy Mountains . Photograph Some of the 4,000 Red Army members who completed the rigorous and meandering 6,000-mile trek from southern to northern China , out of an original force of 86,859 , in june 1936. // Mao ordered his men to protect their eyes from the blinding glare from the snowfields by wrapping cloth around their heads and peering out from between small gaps left between the strips . He also ordered them to eat before setting out , and to wear all the clothing they possessed . Most of the Red Army came from the semitropical areas of southern China near sea level . They had no experience at all in climbing snow-covered peaks . The Great Snowies are said to look like some of the more jagged peaks of the American Rocky Mountains . Spires of rock jutted up threateningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men set out . Before long they had climbed above the tree line and left behind not only green , but practically all other colors . Soon the path they had been traveling disappeared , having been erased by the wind . Mao urged his men on , up one snowfield and down another . Above 14,000 feet , oxygen deprivation began to take its toll . Men struggled just to put one foot in front of the other , all the while gasping in huge breaths of air , seemingly to no avail . As hard as they tried , they could not replenish their muscles , which began to cry out in pain . Invariably , someone would slip on a patch of ice and fall , and all the exertion of his comrades was not enough to lift the exhausted man back on his feet . Finally , the vanguard reached the crest of the pass and the path back down to more oxygen . The strongest then returned to help the wounded and stragglers . Often , however , by the time those unfortunates were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygen . They were left where they fell , to be buried under layer upon layer of snow . When the survivors did reach the crest of the pass , there was no celebration-they simply began the descent . Many of the men , out of exhaustion or due to orders from officers unfamiliar with mountain terrain , sat and began sliding down , whooping with delight as if returning to the fun of a childhood game . But what would start as a mellow descent would sometimes accelerate into a horrifying plunge from the heights . Some tried to dig in their feet to slow themselves , but many had no shoes , and their ragwrapped feet gave no grip on the wind-hardened snow . One after another , men hurtled over the ice and into rocks , where bones snapped with sickening cracks . Many others were catapulted off the edges of cliffs , never to be seen again . Finally , though , the survivors emerged from the midst of avalanches , obscuring fogs and brutal winds , holding hands to keep from falling .

Zhang even " donated " 1,000 or so men to Mao 's depleted ranks . he could afford to be generous ; his army still had close to 80,000 men , who were much better fed and had been on a much less exhausting campaign . But tensions festered just below the surface , and the armies ' two leaders parted under a cloud of mutual suspicion and foreboding . Their rivalry would be decided when Zhang led his redesignated Western-route Army on a disastrous campaign into the far northwest of China , where it was attacked and cut to pieces by Central Asian Muslim horsemen on March 14 , 1937 .
