Emptying out your checking account to take him on vacation . Ignoring the phone calls he gets in the middle of the night . When you 're addicted to that romantic rush , you 'll do anything for your man-anything except leave him BY ALENE DAWSON // Lisa* never imagined herself becoming the other woman . But when she met Larry , a married broker , at a college basketball tournament , something between them quietly clicked . He slipped the 41-year-old teacher his business card , mentioning that sometimes he just needed someone to talk to . " I got obsessed with Larry right away , " admits Lisa , who says she was smarting from her second divorce and vulnerable when they met . It did n't help that after Larry got her number , he persistently called . Dating a married man normally would be out of the question . But Lisa found she enjoyed stepping away from her " straight and narrow " self . " I started rearranging my schedule around his and sneaking away whenever he could , " recalls the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , she was the " good " other woman : When Lisa and Larry went on vacation together , she 'd make him call his family to see if they were okay . She would even remind Larry when his wife 's or daughter 's birthday was approaching so he could get a gift . And there was no shortage of gifts she showered on him : everything from a riding lawn mower for the new house with his family to thousands of dollars to help pay his 1RS bill . When he was fired from his job , she spent all night revising his rsum and composing his cover letter . " It was a rush for me to give him so much , " says Lisa , who reflects now that she wanted to become so necessary to him that he would n't leave her . " It was as if Larry were my drug of choice , and I could n't stop . " So Addicted If you have n't been in Lisa 's shoes yourself-willing to do anything for a man to keep him-you probably know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa in your girlfriend who has bailed her man out of jail more times than you can count . Or in the cousin who 's unhappy with her cheating husband , but keeps believing the situation will improve . These women have one thing in common : They ca n't let go . " Love addiction is the most painful detox there is , " says Charlie Risien , a counselor in San Antonio who 's worked with love addicts for the past ten years . " The addiction is about wanting something to work out in your life so badly that you create a fantasy in your mind that says this guy is " the one . " You think this person has the power to make you happy , when in reality , he 's probably about to bring you all the sadness you can bear . " Deborah , 25 , knows all about creating fantasies around a man . She describes her ex , John , as a knight in shining armor . Yet for the two years they were together , he broke up with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day he 'd say , ? do n't want to bother with you anymore , ' but then two weeks would pass and he 'd call me at two in the morning saying he wanted to hear my voice . It was up and down all the time , " she says . The relationship left her so stressed out she had to take a four-month leave of absence from her job . Even after John gave her herpes , she still wanted to be with him . " I thought , If I take him back after this , it 's my chance to keep him , " she says . It did n't work . He went back to his cheating ways . " Love addicts have difficulty grasping the fact that while love may involve some sacrifice , it is n't about suffering , " explains Michelle McKinney Hammond , author of How to Avoid the Ten Mistakes Single Women Make ( Harvest House Publishers ) . Whether her lover hits her , cheats on her , berates her , or empties her bank account , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the guy . For Lisa that meant ignoring Larry 's marriage-until he started to call her less and less and emotionally check out of the relationship . Afraid she was losing him , she mailed what appeared to be a videotape of them having sex to Larry 's wife . The return address : " Cheater 's Lane . " Since Larry was unemployed at the time , he was the one who got the package from the mail . In fact , that had been Lisa 's plan : It turned out the tape was blank . Lisa said she just wanted to get his attention . Surprisingly , she did n't scare him away . Rooted in Trauma " Wanting to love and be loved is a normal desire , " says Hammond . " We all want to know that we matter , know that we belong . But when we did n't get loved appropriately or enough as a child , that normal desire goes awry . " Experts point to physical abuse , sexual abuse , infidelity in the family and other childhood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does n't come out of the blue ; there 's always a reason , " says Brenda Wade , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in San Francisco who specializes in couples and family therapy . " As a rule , where there 's addiction , you 'll find intergenerational trauma . " Lisa recalls when she was growing up , she sometimes saw her mom sitting with a blank stare at the kitchen table on nights when her dad stayed out late . It was years before she understood what was going on . No one evertalked about infidelity in herfamily . But there were clues . " Once I heard my mom tell my brother , Tm just waiting for some Asian kid to knock'bn the door asking for your dad , ' " she says . According to Wade , author of Power Choices ( Heartline Productions ) , " The key to breaking a pattern of love addiction is to understand why you 're doing what you 're doing so you can change it . You have to be able to say , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pick men who are n't available to me . ' ' " Nonstop Drama Larry was n't the only unavailable man Lisa had chosen . Her first marriage to her college sweetheart lasted two and a half years and ended in infidelity after the two " grew apart . " Lisa 's second marriage , to Keith , a music producer , lasted for seven years , which were marked by constant histrionics once the cheating started . " One day I saw his car parked outside of a hair salon , and I went inside , " she remembers . " There he was , sitting with another woman . When he saw me , he left in a hurry because he knew it was on and poppin ' ' , but I stayed to talk to the woman . She knew everything about me . Our baby had even been to her house . " Keith disappeared for a few days to let things cool off , but the two stayed together for years after the incident , during which time Lisa says she was extremely unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of depression , " says Wade . " Love addicts are hooked on the adrenaline rush of the drama . " That could help explain why Lisa stayed with Keith after he came home with his shirt inside out ; why she took his word over her best friend 's when the friend told her Keith had hit on her ; and why she did n't complain when Keith 's pager would go off late at night , and he 'd leave for a meeting with a " client . " " I used to see the same number come up on his pager hundreds of times , " Lisa remembers . " Sometimes I 'd go for a drive , take his pager , and just throw it out the window . " Even now , Lisa ca n't fully explain why she put up with Keith 's bad behavior . " He once told me , Old school hangs in there , ' " she says , meaning you do n't just quit on a longtime relationship . And , still emotionally tied to her ex , Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , but I wish I 'd stayed with him longer . " To end the cycle of compulsive behavior , says Wade , a woman has to get clear on what she really expects from a man . " With addicts I always start with the question : " What makes you think you deserve so little ? ' " she says . " I try to help them see that a brother who 's married , noncommittal , abusive or unfaithful is not going to be able to give you the love you truly desire . " All About Your Man Stevie , a 24-year-old nursing student , is just starting to understand her own pattern of choosing men who give her less than she desires . " When I first met Anthony , he did n't have a car or a driver 's license and worked a low-level retail job , " says Stevie , who , months into therapy , now realizes she habitually dates blue-collar guys , thinking they 'll admire her drive and look up to her . " I knew he could do better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anthony promised her he 'd go to driving school , apply to college , and find a better job , but none of that happened . " Three years later I 'm still chauffeuring him around and paying most of the bills , " complains Stevie , who 's so overworked she was recently admitted to the hospital for exhaustion . Risien , the counselor , explains that there are two critical steps in overcoming love addiction . First you have to identify the fantasy that you 've created . " Write down on a piece of paper what you think this person has that you need , " says Risien . Stevie , for example , might think she needs Anthony 's willingness to adore her , his intellectual potential , or the possibility of his being a husband . But she has n't seen any of that materialize in her relationship , Risien points out . " When people identify the fantasy , the denial breaks down and they 're able to see the person for who he really is . What is she getting out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion . " The second step , says Risien , is to take a good look at the barriers that stand in the way of your building a lasting relationship with this personlike his unavailability , his emotional distance or instability . " A love addict generally does n't notice that there are walls all around her partner , " says Risien . But help her acknowledge them , and she can begin to see that the relationship was likely doomed from the start , and it 's time to walk away . Getting Closure " I have n't been able to quit Larry cold turkey , " says Lisa , who admits she 's seen him a couple of times in the last month . " It 's so hard to let go . " But if s not impossible . " You are not stuck with your history of love addiction , but you have to fight tooth and nail to overcome it , " says Wade . She explains that love junkies must choose to do the hard work to rewire old patterns of belief that say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get counseling or participate in a 12-step program like Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous , in which they can work on building their self-esteem and looking at how their obsession has affected their lives for the worse . " Only when we give ourselves the love we are craving can we put love addiction behind us , " says Wade . Setting up a network of friends to support you can be helpful as well . " Your friends can hold you accountable , " explains author Hammond . " But you have to agree to remain transparent with them and not isolate yourself . " Best of all , when you get to the point of refusing to settle for less than you 're worth , you wo n't be flying solo . " When you get to that place of celebrating yourself , " says Hammond , " you can be sure someone good will want to come join the party .
