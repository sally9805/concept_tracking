<p> New religions do not arise every day , so serious note should be taken when a belief moves from cult status to bona fide faith . Recently a nascent creed has stolen the hearts and minds of thousands of young Americans . Its key tenets include the idea that everyone gets along really well in high school , and thus that being a teenager is super fun . <p> The name of this new religion is " High School Musical . " <p> What began as a mere made-for-television movie ( on the Disney Channel , yet ) has grown quickly into an international phenomenon both commercial and spiritual , at least for tweenage youngsters ( mostly girls ) . DVDs , CDs , T-shirts , memorabilia and a spinoff concert tour have provided ardent adherents with the relics , icons and apostolic encounters necessary for proper devotion . Now the flock anxiously awaits the coming of a second revelation . The new testament , " High School Musical 2 , " will first be shown on the Disney Channel on Friday . <p> At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a singing and dancing creche , you might say  --  has at last been assembled and sent out on the road to help believers keep the faith . The live production of " High School Musical " played preview dates in Detroit and Philadelphia before opening officially here in Chicago at the LaSalle Bank Theater , where it plays through Sept. 2 . As a chronicler of the theatrical theology , journalistic duty required that I be in attendance . <p> For the uninitiated , some background is perhaps in order . Just as new faiths grow out of old belief systems ( see Judaism and Christianity ) , " High School Musical " is essentially derived from a previous mythology promulgated in the latter days of the 20th century . Namely , " Grease . " ( That religion has of course not wholly died out ; indeed , representatives of a new sect emerge on Broadway this very month . ) <p> As in " Grease , " in which girl and boy from opposite worlds fight social ostracism to find true love in high school , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " High School Musical , " battle peer pressure and self-doubt on the rocky road to romance . <p> " High School Musical " does , however , represent a significant philosophical evolution of the Greasian liturgy . In the old , strictly Manichean system , the lovebirds ' happy union was effected only when the good girl , Sandy , abandoned her principles ( and her ponytail ) to embrace the darker beliefs of her beloved , Danny . In the movie version , you 'll recall , Olivia Newton-John frizzed her hair , squeezed herself into black spandex and shimmied like mad to signify her baptism . <p> In " High School Musical , " neither the studious Gabriella nor the jock Troy is forced to abandon a " clique " ( to use the academic term ) ; instead they assert their independence from cultural oppression ( the " status quo , " as one of the key hymns has it ) by declaring their allegiance both to each other and to the great god Thespis in another sphere of endeavor . They find true fulfillment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anyway , the stage version , peppily directed by Jeff Calhoun ( who staged and choreographed the last Broadway revival of " Grease " ) and with a book by David Simpatico ( based on the Peter Barsocchini teleplay ) , includes all the infectious songs from the movie , in virtually the same order , as well as two new ones . <p> The stage adaptation does make some minor but significant dramaturgical adjustments . Character motivations are subtly enriched ; important contextual signifiers are added ; the narrative arc is elaborated with the addition of nuanced emotional subtext that ... er , what am I talking about ? <p> What followers really need to know is that John Jeffrey Martin , who plays Troy , the captain of the basketball team who discovers his inner drama geek , sings well and is very cute , with a nice smile and glinty blue eyes . Acolytes of the sainted Zac Efron , who created the role in the movie , should nevertheless be warned that Mr. Martin does not possess Mr. Efron 's signature floppy-swoopy hairdo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perky bristle . <p> Aside from this radical , possibly heretical departure , few liberties have been taken in the casting department . Arielle Jacobs is charmingly demure , like Vanessa Anne Hudgens , as Gabriella . Chandra Lee Schwartz flounces capably as the haughty , histrionic villainess Sharpay , just like Ashley Tisdale in the movie . <p> Admirably , the stage version is more forthright in its hints that Sharpay 's brother and pet leading man , Ryan ( the perky Bobby List ) , is gay . ( For one thing , he gets a few catty jokes . In a scene new to the stage version , in which Sharpay displays some self-esteem issues , Ryan bucks her up by suggesting things could have been worse : " They could have named you Pug . " ) <p> This is in keeping with a crucial article of this new faith , that it is O.K. to be yourself , even if it means whipping up a mean creme brulee after basketball practice . Especially if it means whipping up a mean creme brulee after basketball practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools I can not say , and frankly doubt . But religious devotion is not really about encountering the harsh truths of the world , but about seeking some solace for them and finding the inspiration to change them . <p> On that score , call me a skeptical believer in " High School Musical " and its power to improve the world . " We 're all in this together , " the chorus of the show 's climactic anthem , is probably as profound and morally instructive as most religious precepts . So , go Wildcats !
