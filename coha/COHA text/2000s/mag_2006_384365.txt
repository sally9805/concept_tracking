As American Idol successfully completes its quest for word domination , we are stirred to ask : Who is this Ryan Seacrest ? Well , as the Bible says , he is known by many names . // Ryan Seacrest , history 's greatest monster , has a full plate this morning . The KIIS-FM phone lines are lit , his cohost , Ellen K , has the latest on the 911 tape of Yanni 's allegedly battered girlfriend , today 's call-in theme-dishonesty-has n't reached liftoff yet , and Monique on line 2 says that her hubby , Carl , thinks Ryan 's gay . " Is Carl gay ? " Seacrest snaps . " Is Carl gay ? " Monique , who has phoned in from somewhere in the sprawlingtar pit of lost souls known as Los Angeles to own up to once denting a parked car without leaving a note , says her man Carl is not gay . " Welllll , " says Ryan , " how can Carl be so sure ? " Ellen K- I " m fairly sure that her if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility-leans toward her microphone . " I wish I had a gay ATM for every time someone asked me that question , " she says . " I would be so rich . " " Thanks for the call , " says Seacrest . " And tell Carl to stop hatin ' ' . And if he thinks I am-c'mon , Carl , show me your moves . see if I 'm turned on . " Oh , he 's an enigma all right , big-grinning Ryan Seacrest , a mystery wrapped in a shroud of boyish bonhomie so thick , you 'd need a pitchfork to pierce it . His green eyes glazed with pale gold , his patch of dirt-brown bedhead mussed just so , his chipmunk cheeks and square jaw dotted by winsome stubble-put him in khaki shorts and a blue bandanna and you 've got the world 's richest Eagle Scout . Yet , at thirty-one , he seems so goddamn old . Choppers as big and white as dentures , wrinkling neck , rutted brow , the faint smell of sour coffee and green Tabasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ancient . Clearly , being the fleshly embodiment of evil accelerates the aging process , and radio does the rest : Every moment counts , literally , and must hum with manufactured glee-or , better yet , woe-lest these poor dumb fucks stuck in traffic and trapped in a gray existence tune their ears and dials away from the unctions of the Devil . " Hi , Jessica . " " Hi . " " Are you sure you wan na do this ? " " Um , I changed my mind . Never mind . " Jessica 's voice is quaking . " Whaddya mean you changed your mind ? You ca n't change your mind . Jessica ? " " Yeah-who 's this ? " " My name is Ryan . " " This is n't Ryan . " " Yeah it is . Why do n't you believe me ? " " I do n't know . Because I listen to you every morning . You sound a little bit different in person . " " Well , how do I sound ? " " You sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out I have n't been home in a week . All right , now listen , Jessica : Tell me what 's goin'on . " " Well , I ... I ... I 've been having an affair with my boss . " " " I 've been having an affair with my boss . ' Is your boss married ? " " Well , yeah . " " Are you ? " " No . " " Have you ever met your boss 's wife ? " " Yes . " " Do you take her calls when she calls the office ? " " No . " " Where have you met her ? " " Um , at the office . " " Is it worth it , what you 're doing ? Is it worth it , knowing all of the ramifications of sleeping with a married man who is your boss ? Is it worth it ? " Jessica hangs up in Satan 's ear . " How do you not ask that question ? " Seacrest 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a feeling that guy 's gon na be pissed at me " cause he 's not gon na get any more office action . " " Well , " says Ellen K , " he should n't . " " That was awesome , " Seacrest says . " She hung up right at the point of impact . That was great . Love it ! " Ryan Seacrest dwells in the air from 5:00 to 10:00 each weekday morning , hostingL . A. 's most popular radio show . From February through May , two or three nights per week-depending on how many feckless , talent-free wannabes remain-he hosts American Idol , a sewer of innocent depravity that draws thirty million TV viewers per night . Weekends find him hosting American Top 40 , the nationally syndicated radio countdown of all the best pap that now passes for popular music . Seacrest 's also the managing editor and lead anchor of E ! News-his $20 million deal with E ! gives him a shot , with corporate backing , to create , market , and own new shows-and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fart 's off being fitted for yet another new heart . And starting last December 31 , he 's heir to Dick Clark 's drool cup on New Year 's Rockiri Eve . So you can see why Ryan might sound as if he needs a nap . But napping is for mortals . The Angel of the Bottomless Pit has souls to harvest , a mission demanding as much science as art . Seacrest 's voice-full of wiseass pep-has worked on radio for more than half his present incarnation , dating to his high school days in suburban Atlanta . It is not a versatile or interesting voice-expunged of all traces of any but the most generic middle-American accent , it is the aural equivalent of abagof fast-food fries-but it is quick and , in a familiar sort of way , engaging . From a studio on the fifth floor of a faceless , nameless office building in Burbank , surrounded by soundless TV and computer screens , tiers of digital-editing equipment , and a knot of assistants , Seacrest connects to the masses . He says " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks he would n't piss on if they were in flames , and invariably they reply , " I love you , too . " They are no less precious to Old Scratch for their facelessness . Names and faces mean dick ; hell needs numbers . " Five- , six- , seven- , and eight-o'clock hours , we program the show differently , " he explains as a Mary J. Blige tune spins . Some hours , Seacrest somehow finds enough time between traffic reports , gossip , promos , and ads to play as many as three songs . " The five-o'clock hour , people are waking up , people are going home from the overnight shift , so we 're a little bit more adult . At the six-o'clock hour , kids are gettingup , getting ready for school , starting to listen with their moms and dads . As we get closer to seven-this is the " mass-cume " hour-everybody 's in their car . You 've got the carpooling , you 've got the commuters , and so we do a very mainstream hour . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because school starts right about 8:30 . The mission is to get the moms to come back after they 've let their kids go . " Mass-cume ? " Youngkids , teenagers , moms , dads , singles-it 's our biggest listenership hour . " Cume ? " Cumulative . We have the biggest cume in the city in morning drive-over two million . So we sell our advertising as mainstream . I do n't try to be too controversial , too dirty , too this , too that . It 's fun and it 's real , but it 's kind of right up the middle . " And with the punch of abutton , Seacrest slides directly from this tutorial live to air : " Hey , if you missed our conversation about Britney Spears and is she preggo or not-there 're rumors that she 's having another baby-we 'll try and get to the bottom of it before we get outta here at ten o'clock . " It turns out that there is no bottom to get to . Britney 's publicist , on line 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britney is not having a baby . " But , of course , kno wing anything is entirely beside the point . Ryan Seacrest 's job , in his own words , is " content provider " - Lucifer 's gum-ball machine-and at that level of abstraction , the being or non- of a fresh Spears zygote matters not a whit . The preggo question is itself the content ; any answer , or no answer , will do just fine . The gum-ball machine does n't care what shiny , sugared ball of goo rolls down its chute . He bolts from his stool at 9:57 A.M. and hustles down the hall to his office , where one of his two personal assistants hands him a sheaf of paper , printouts of yesterday 's Google Alerts . I myself have read thousands of Google Alerts for Ryan Seacrest . He is either feuding with Idol judge Paula Abdul or he is not . He is either feuding with Idol judge Simon Cowell or he is not . He is either canoodling with the Desperate Housewife Teri Hatcher or he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homo , metro , or shmetrosexual , or not . " There was an agent I worked with who said , " You should really try and curb that innuendo , ' " Seacrest says . " I thought , Why ? Who cares ? I know what I 'm attracted to , and that 's a/emale . It 's somehow become a stripe in the Ryan Seacrest business ; it somehow takes on a life of its own just because I 'm not the stereotypical guy . A friend of mine has a house with a basketball court and a pool . The guys go over and play basketball ; I lie by the pool and nap in the sun . That defines me . That 's consistent with who I am . I do n't pretend to play basketball because I wan na feel like one of the guys . I wan na lie in the sun and relax . " Never believe people in this business who say they do n't read what 's written about them , " he says , thumbing quickly through the stack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , clears his head . Five drive-time hours of radio are done . Soon , he 's due at the American Idol studio , where four innocent children with stars in their eyes and songs in their hearts will be primped for sacrifice tonight . I ca n't prove the guy is Mephisto , but this I know : When Belial lands on planet Earth , he - wo n't be sporting horns and bare hooves ; the Tempter do n't roll like dat . Seacrest 's Bentley-his other car is an Aston Martin-is black , with tinted windows , and yet it shines in the gloom . I tailed it late one morning through a March thunderstorm from the underground garage of the Burbank office complex , through the Cahuenga Pass , into the bowels of Hollywood , and not a drop of rain touched it . And I 'll tell you something else : If Ryan Seacrest wants your gig , you 'd better check your pulse and hide your fingernail clippings . Ask Dick Clark , or what 's left of him . Ask casey Kasem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious swelling left his tongue permanently clamped to his upper palate . Ask Rick Dees , who had the KIIS morning show for twenty-two years , until a few days after Rosemary 's Baby bribed a janitor to swipe one of his hankies and Dees suddenly , simultaneously was struck with incurable hives and hiccups , essentially ending his radio career . Or ask the ghost of Brian Dunkleman , the sad-sack comic who was Seacrest 's American Idol cohost during its first season , back when nobody knew Idol would grow a huge pair of creamy tits and Seacrest wore golden highlights in his flatironed hair . Poor Dunkleman just disappeared . You 'd have an easier time finding Jimmy Hoffa . Hannah Arendt had it right : Evil does n't puke green soup . Evil puts his nose to the grindstone and his shoulder to the wheel . Evil drops out of the University of Georgia in 1994 , at the age of nineteen , and heads for L. A. in a Honda Prelude with $2,000 in Christmas cash he stashed over the years and a job cohosting Gladiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a thirteen-year-old girl . " I auditioned for it , and they offered me the job at $200 an episode , " Seacrest says . " I got that audition because I was actually hosting a show for ESPN while I was in college , Radical Outdoor Challenge . The production company was based in Atlanta , they needed a host for cheap , I did it . On ESPN , who cares what you 're doin ' ' ? I could n't believe it was on ESPN . I sent the tape to the Gladiators people , got the Gladiators gig , said to my mother , " I 've got a job . It 's not gon na be able to pay for much , but I 've got a job . We 're gon na do thirteen episodes at two hundred bucks a pop , and I wan na go . ' " Over the next several years , Seacrest hosted every two-bit TV extravaganza this side of Robert Blake 's perp walk- everything from Wild Animal Games and Ultimate Revenge to Disneyland 2000:45 Years of Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept working his way up the FM dial . " I 've conditioned myself to go to work even ' day at a studio , " he says . " I have gone to a radio station every day of my life since I was fifteen years old . It 's just a part of who I 've become . I was not born to dunk the basketball , I was not born to play an instrument , I was not born to hit all the notes . I was not born to do any of those things . What I 've figured out how to do is make people feel comfortable on television and on the radio , which enables me to have access to them , which is key for what I do . And I think more than anything else , I know when I go to bed that no one 's working/wrderdoing what I 'm doing , and I think , quite frankly , simply that hard work at some point was gon na pay off . " Seacrest 's talking while he 's getting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which goes live in an hour , at 5:00 P.M. PST , twelve hours after his radio show began this morning . He has a post-Idol dinner meeting with an E ! VP , and a predinner . Extra interview at the restaurant . He 's an investor in the restaurant , too-in six restaurants , actually , three in L. A. and three in Las Vegas , steak joints and sushi houses . He has a line of clothes . He 's also fixing to buy Kevin Costner 's palazzo , a ten-thousandsquare-foot , SU.5 million home in the Hollywood Hills with a tennis court and movie theater . But all of this is small potatoes beside the billion-dollar empire Seacrest plans to build . " I learned a very important word just after I turned twentyone . I learned the word equity . That was a very important word . That is the home run . I got the chance to shadow MervGriffin and spend time with Dick Clark-guys who had done it in the broadcast world-and I realized what I do , what the public gets to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really want to do . What these guys did , they used all those shows-American Bandstand and Pyramid and The Men'Griffin Show-as sales devices to get in the door to sell other projects that they owned . Because Dick Clark was coming , they 'd take a meeting with him . But he did n't want to talk about beinga host ; he wanted to talk about selling a show . And that 's the model we 've set up through the E ! deal . " Seacrest 's voice is hushed , full of ravenous determination . Tonight , his Idol dresser has chosen a dark-blue suit , with a dark-blue shirt and tie . All dolled up , his eyes blank gray , Seacrest looks exactly like a man primed to provide content to thirty million Americans who will spend the next irretrievable hour ingestinga long ad for Coke , Ford , cell phones , and the twisted illusion-thanks to a viewer **27;2926;TOOLONG than forty million phone calls during the two hours immediately after Idol airs-that talent and democracy are somehow compatible . But give this devil his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight " singers " and three bickering , babbling " judges " through a sixty-minute maze of plugola is the only subtle aspect of American Idol . I watch him on the TV set in his dressing room , because Idol does n't allow " journalists " on the live set , and the man on the screen in the darkblue suit and shirt is a perfect traffic cop , genial and efficient . Each ticking second pivots upon hisglad-handing , bantering , and breaking for commercial while milking the " drama " - and yet he seems not to be there at all . It is nothing to sneeze at , this hard-earned gift of his . Moments after the show signs off , when he returns to the dressing room , he still seems not to be here . " Okay , " he says , removing only his necktie . " All rise . Movin " on . " At the restaurant , on Sunset Boulevard , the Extra crew greets him with lights and cameras as he leaves the Bentley for the valet to park . Inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fortunately for me , " he tells the woman from exTra , who has been oohing on camera over his success , " I 'm in this unique business of not singing , not dancing , not performing-just kind of being there .... " Suddenly it 's clear who and what Ryan Seacrest is : Chance-Chauncey Gardiner , Jerzy Kosinski 's passive , sexless , tube-addicted cipher , whose own TV debut in Being There finds him " drained of thought , engaged , yet removed .... Television reflected only people 's surfaces ; it also kept peeling their images from their bodies until they were sucked into the caverns of their viewers ' eyes , forever beyond retrieval , to disappear . " Seacrest 's alarm rings at four the next morning . An hour and a half into the radio show , he is on the phone with Donald Trump , who 's in L. A. to cast the sixth season of The Apprentice . It 's a pleasant chat-Trump is about to spawn again . Martha Stewart is a whiny loser , the lineup for auditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-between two of our nation 's premier pimps . " You know I love you , " Seacrest says to Trump before hanging up . " I love you , too , " Trump answers . Afterward , during a stretch of commercials and the traffic update- " The northbound 5 is whimpering along in slow motion , " Commander Chuck Street , pilot-poet of the Pepsi Jet Ranger 1 helicopter reports-Seacrest scarfs his take-out egg whites . Mondays and Wednesdays , the egg whites are doctored with a few drops of green Tabasco . Tuesdays and Thursdays , he mixes in some crumbled feta . Fridays , a yolk . " So I do n't have the same thing every day , " he explains . But that 's the rotation ? " That 's the rotation . It 's actually written up in the cubicle back there for Crystal so she can order the right one on the right day . " How many egg whites ? " Like , six egg whites . " Azoy . One of Seacrest 's junior producers has a segment idea : His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptionist and an appointment at the doctor 's office this morning , so Seacrest can fly along as wingman via cell phone and help Mr. Hapless score a date . " I love it , " Seacrest says . " Let 's create awkward moment after awkward moment . " Which is precisely what he does . The ninny gets nowhere , and the receptionist gets in hot water with her bosses for yakkingon the phone while she 's at work . " Would you call yourself hot ? " Seacrest asks her . " I 'm the typical brunette in glasses at the desk , basically , " she tells him . It makes for good radio , and Seacrest 's brain starts storming . " You know what would be a great show ? Get a guy-like Wilmer Valderrama-and his posse , his entourage , right ? So his entourage , they all struggle with the girls , let 's say . He does essentially what I did , not on the radio , but on TV . You have him try and hook his buddy up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of it . That 's funny , right ? " " That 's great , " says Ellen K. Thus inspired , Seacrest plays a Shakira tune and phones an E ! development executive while she 's still in her car on the way to work . " I had this idea , " he tells her . " And I want you to bake it a little bit . " " Okay , I 'm baking . " And he makes the pitch-a guy like Wilmer Valderrama and his socially inept posse , all of that - and adds , " You get to kind of cover celebrity and dating . " " Exactly , " she says . " Which is always a good thing . " She pauses . " Do you want to hear something funny ? " " Someone just pitched it , " Seacrest says , disappointed . " No . Well , yeah . Someone has pitched it . You know who it was , about nine months ago ? " " Who ? " " Stephen Baldwin . " " He pitched that show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " She just laughs . " Dammit , " says Seacrest . " Well , there are no new ideas in this town . We just did it on the air , and it was great . " " Was there a celebrity on the air or no ? " " No , just me . But , it worked . Actually , it did n't work . The girl almost got fired . Which is great . " " Well , there you go . Where are you right now ? " " I 'm on the air . I got ninety seconds , then I got ta go back on . " " All right . Well , call me later . " Crestfallen , Seacrest neglects to mention that he loves her . Could be he does n't , or maybe he 's tired . Unshaved , harrumphing his throat clear , he signs off quickly- " It 's 9:53 , thank you for havin " us on , Seacrest out " - and bolts the radio station , bowlegged in his boots and jeans . Billboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His E ! deal runs for three years . He has three more years to go on his KIIS contract . Idol 's ratings this season-its fifth-are higher than ever . It could go on without Randy , Paula , and Simon-two potted plants and a smug prick-but not without the Dark Lord of Hosts . Not that he 's going anywhere . " If they said , " Hey , you 're gon na be charged $10,000 a month to host American Idol , ' I 'd pay $20,000 . This is something that I would pay to be a part of , to drive everything else I 'm doing . It fuels everything else . It allows me the exposure and the access to the public and to the executives in our business . But it 's not my baby . I 'm a hired hand . No equity . " Tonight 's Idol costume is a black suit-and-shirt combo , which goes nicely with the stubble . " It 's a good suit , right ? " Indeed it is . In a few minutes , Seacrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and thirty million Americans will hang on his every word . " These contestants are so close to the finals , they can taste it , " he will say . " But there is only room for twelve . The country has voted , and the results are in . The drama is about to unfold , and anything can happen . This-is American Idol . " His pacing and inflection will be perfect . I will get gooseflesh sitting here listening to him , and I 'll wonder for a moment if I 'm getting sick . Tomorrow morning , at the radio station , I will do something I have never done before as a professional : I 'll ask Seacrest to sign a photo for my six-year-old son . YOU ARE MY IDOL , Seacrest will inscribe it . Next week , back in New Jersey , we 'll sit on the living-room sofa to watch the show , and my boy will see Ryan Seacrest and say , " I bet he 's thinking of me . " Get thee behind me , Seacrest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and silently pray for his mortal soul . Sidebar Seacrest scarfs his take-out eggwhites .
