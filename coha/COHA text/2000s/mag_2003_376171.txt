Microsoft is famous for getting software right on the second or third go-round , and this year marks the second try for its Windows XP Media Center Edition . When it debuted last year , Media Center was the first PC system nongeeks could operate like a combination TiVo  --  DVD player  --  music jukebox . This year 's update enhances the photo slide show and adds a radio tuner . Better yet are two movie-download services and a program that lets you burn DVDs by using just the remote control . The user interface could still be improved , but with living-room-friendly PCs coming from Dell , Gateway and others , even DVD-equipped TiVos will face stiff competition this holiday season . <P>  --  By Wilson Rothman
