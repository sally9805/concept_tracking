I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE WOMAN . I am afraid she might hurt herself , perhaps has already hurt herself  --  there 's no way to know which of the return dates stamped on the book of poetry was hers . The book , Denise Levertov 's Evening Train , belongs to the New York City Public Library . I checked it out yesterday and can keep it for three weeks . Ever since my husband and I moved to the city several months ago , I 've been homesick for my books , the hundreds of volumes stored in my brother 's basement . I miss having them near me , running my hands over their spines , recalling when and where I acquired each one , and out of what need . <p> There 's no way to know for certain that the phantom library patron is a woman , but all signs point in that direction . On one page is a red smear that looks like lipstick , and between two other pages , lying like a bookmark , is a long , graying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made by the woman , are in pencil  --  pale , tentative marks I study carefully , reverently , the way an archaeologist traces a fossil 's delicate imprint . The rest is dream , conjecture , the making of my story . It 's a weird obsession , I know , studying other readers ' leavings and guessing the lives lived beneath . Even as my reasonable mind is having its say ( This makes no sense . How can you assume ? The marks could have been made by anyone , for any reason , over any period of time ... ) , my other self is leaving on its own journey . I 've always been a hungry reader , what one friend calls a " selfish reader . " But is there any other kind ? Do n't we all read to answer our own needs , to complete the lives we 've begun , to point us toward some light ? <p> Some of the underlinings in Evening Train have been partially erased ( eraser crumbles have gathered in the center seams ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover her tracks . The markings do not strike me as those of a defiant woman but rather of one who has not only taken her blows but feels she might deserve them . She has underlined " serviceable heart " in one poem ; in another , " Grey-haired , I have not grown wiser . " If she exists , I would like to sit down with this woman . We seem to have a lot in common . We chose the same book , we both wear red lipstick , and though I am not so honest ( the gray in my hair is hidden beneath an auburn rinse ) , I am probably her age or thereabouts . <p> And from what she has left behind on the pages of Levertov 's poems , it appears that our hearts have worn down in the same places . This is the part that worries me . Though my heart has mended , for the time being at least , hers seems to be in the very act of breaking . A present-tense pain pulses through each marked-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes what she is considering . I want to reach through the pages and lead her out . <p> My interest in marginalia , reading between the lines , began when I was an evening student at a college in California , still living with my parents but working days to help pay my expenses . It was a lonely time . Untethered from the rock-hard rituals of high school , I 'd been set adrift , floating between adolescence and Real Life , a place I 'd heard about that both terrified and seduced me . As a toddler , I 'd been one of those milkily content clingers who must be pulled away from the nipple ; eighteen years later I was still reluctant to leave my mother 's side . <p> My siblings had no such trouble : An older sister had married and left home , a brother was away at college , and my younger siblings , in various stages of adolescent rebellion , had struck out on their own . As for my friends , most had left to study at faraway colleges ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank or training to be dental assistants , seemed even more remote than those who had left . Whatever had held us together in high school  --  intramural sports , glee club , the senior-class play  --  was light-years away . As was the boy who 'd promised to marry me someday . He 'd found someone else , and though part of me had always known that 's how that book would end ( we 'd never progressed beyond kissing ) , nevertheless his leaving was the first hairline crack in my serviceable heart . <p> My only strike at independence was the paycheck I earned typing invoices at a printing shop . Though I reluctantly accepted my father 's offer to pay tuition costs , I insisted on buying my own textbooks . I could afford only used ones , and the more used the book , the cheaper it was . Some had passed through several hands ; the multiple marked-through names and phone numbers on the flyleaves bore witness to this fact . At first I was put off by the previous owners ' underlinings , marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscenities . Worse still were the unintentional markings-coffee stains , dried pizza sauce , cigarette burns . <p> After a while , however , I became accustomed to the markings . I even began to welcome them . Since I did n't live on campus or have college buddies  --  I worked all day , then went straight home after class-I appreciated the company the used books offered . I imagined the boy who had splattered pizza sauce across the map of South America . Was he lonely too ? Had he eaten the pizza alone , in his tiny dorm room , while memorizing Bolivia 's chief exports ? What about the girl who had misspelled orgasm ( using two s 's ) in the margins of John Donne 's " The Canonization " ? Had she ever said the word aloud ? Was she a virgin like me ? <p> The used texts served practical purposes as well . In the case of difficult subject matter ( which , for me , meant political science , chemistry , and botany ) , it was as though I had engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guide me through each lesson , pointing out important concepts , underlining the principles that would show up on next week 's exam . The marked-up textbook was my portable roommate , someone to sit up nights with me , to quiz me with questions I did n't know enough to ask . <p> Not since I was a child sharing a room with Great-Aunt Bessie , an inveterate reader , had I had a reading partner . Bessie and I would sit up late in our double bed and read mysteries and westerns aloud . We 'd take turns , each reading a chapter a night , and at the end , right before Bessie removed her dentures and switched off the light ( she was a disciplined reader , always stopping at the end of a chapter ) , right before she slipped her embroidered handkerchief into the book to mark our place , we would discuss our reactions to what we had read and make predictions about how the story would turn . Because of Aunt Bessie , I never saw books as dead , finished texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which we would venture the next night , and the next . Anything could happen , and we would be present when it did . <p> Years later , carrying this lesson into my first college class , I was amazed at what I encountered : rows of bleary-eyed students slumped around me , their limp hands spread across Norton anthologies . Most never ventured into the territory Bessie and I had explored . This stymied me , that people could read a poem by Shelley or Keats or Sylvia Plath and not want to live inside it , not want to add their words to the ones on the page . Looking back on my college literature texts , I can trace the journey of those years . In the margins of Wordsworth 's sonnets , beside the lines " The world is too much with us ; late and soon , / Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers , " I can chart my decision to quit my day job and pursue my studies full-time , even if it meant borrowing from the savings account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with this , " I wrote in blue ink , meaning the commerce of getting and spending , the laying waste of powers I 'd yet to discover . <p> And in the underlined sections of Gerard Manley Hopkins 's poems , I can trace the ecstasy of my first spiritual awakening ( " I caught this morning morning 's minion " ) , made all the more ecstatic since , because I was unable to understand his elliptical syntax with my mind , I was forced to take it in through the rhythms of my body . This was a new music for me . My heart was no longer metaphorical . It beat rapidly in my chest , my temples , in my pale , veined wrists . Suddenly , within Hopkins 's lines , I was breaking in new places : " here/ Buckle ! And the fire that breaks from thee then , a billion/ Times told lovelier , more dangerous . " <p> At the time I encountered those lines , I had no knowledge of the fire that awaited me in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw myself vaguely , like a character in one of the books I fell asleep with each night . In dreams I drank black coffee at street cafes , lay beneath the branches of the campus oaks , or wandered late at night , as Whitman 's narrator had wandered , looking up " in perfect silence at the stars . " In daylight , I pulled another used book from the shelf and fell into its pages . Could it be that Rilke 's injunction , " You must change your life , " was aimed at me ? I highlighted it in yellow , then wrote in the margin , in bright blue indelible ink , " THIS MEANS YOU ! " <p> Had I chosen to resell these books to the campus bookstore ( I did n't ; they had become part of me ) , their new owners might one day have read my underlinings , my marginal scribblings , and wondered at the person who left such a trail . " She needs to get more sun , " they might have thought , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worried about me the way I now worry about the gray-haired woman . They might even have responded , as I sometimes do , with an answering note . It might have gone on and on like that , a serial installment of marginalia , each new reader adding his own twist to Hopkins or Wordsworth  --  or to me , the phantom whose pages they were turning . <p> When life interrupts , you close the book . Or perhaps you leave it open , facedown on the bed or table , to mark your place . Aunt Bessie taught me never to do this . " You 'll break its spine , " she said , running her age-spotted hands across the book 's cover , and the tenderness in her gesture made me ashamed that I 'd ever considered such violence . After that I took to dog-earing pages , but after a while even that seemed too violent . Now , whenever I encounter a dog-eared page , I smooth its wounded edge . <p> Aunt Bessie used embroidered handkerchiefs to mark her place , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a chapter . Some readers are like that . They regulate their reading , fitting books neatly into their lives the way some people schedule exercise or sex : five poems , twenty laps . One of my friends always stops after twenty-five pages so she can easily remember where she left off . Though I admire such discipline , I 've never been able to accomplish it . I fall into books the way I fall into lust  --  wholly , hungrily . Often the book disappoints , or I disappoint . The first flush cools and the words grow tired and dull , or I grow tired and dull and slam the book shut . Occasionally , though , I keep reading , and lust ripens slowly into love , and I want to stay right there , at the lamplit table or in the soft , worn chair , until the last page is turned . <p> Then suddenly , always unexpectedly , life interferes ; it is what life does best . It usually happens in mid-paragraph , sometimes even mid-sentence  --  a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Though I own many beautiful bookmarks , they are never there when I need them . So I reach for whatever is close at hand . A newspaper clipping , the phone bill , my bourbon-fossiled cocktail napkin , a note from a friend , the grocery list . Once I plucked a protruding feather from the sofa cushion where I rested my head , once I used a maple leaf that had blown in through the patio door , once I even pulled a hair from my head . <p> Looking back on my nineteenth year , I am amazed at how easily I closed the books I 'd been living inside . What replaced them were the poems the young man handed me across a restaurant table . " Pretty Brown-Haired Girl " was the title of one ; " Monday Rain " another . Some were written in German , and I used my secondhand Cassell 's dictionary to translate them . The poems were not good  --  I remember thinking this even then-but they were the first love poems anyone had ever written for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded the papers , put them into my pocket , and later that night unfolded them on my bedside table . Already the poems were in my head , every ragged line-break and rhyme . <p> At twenty-one he had one of those faces that might have looked old all along . His hair was retreating prematurely , exposing a forehead with furrows already deeply plowed . But his eyes were bright blue , center-of-a-flame blue , simultaneously cool and hot . He wore faded jeans and a rugged woolen jacket and drove a motorcycle ; his mouth tasted of cigarettes . Plus he could quote Wordsworth , which weakened me even more . He was independently brilliant , a part-time student with no declared major , taking classes in subjects like German and astronomy and horticulture-nothing that fit together to form anything like a formal degree . " Come into the light of things , " he teased . " Let nature be your teacher . " <p> Nature taught me so much over the next year that it was all I could do to attend classes , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the margins of textbooks . He 'd moved into his own apartment , and his marks were all over me  --  his mouth on my forehead , his tongue on my neck , my belly , the smell of his cigarettes in my hair . All else fell away . When an occasional misgiving surfaced I pushed it down . I had reason to doubt that I was his only brown-haired girl , the only one to whom he wrote poems . But I hushed the voice of reason , even when it spoke directly into my ear . <p> My parents disapproved of him , and though Aunt Bessie had moved back to her Midwest childhood home , I was certain she would have disapproved too . I knew Carolyn did . She 'd told me so , in the same loving yet blatantly forthright tone she 'd used on me since I was small . Carolyn was my mother 's best friend , and had served as a kind of alternate mother for me as long as I could remember . Perhaps mother is the wrong word ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only loved books but believed in them , even more so than Aunt Bessie . Carolyn believed that books could change our lives , could save us from ourselves . <p> My mother also loved books , but while she was raising her six children  --  sometimes single-handedly , when my pilot father was overseas  --  she put reading aside . I can not recall , during those years , ever seeing my mother sit down , except to play a game of Monopoly or Old Maid , or to sew our Halloween costumes or Easter dresses . Certainly not to read . Late at night , when my father was away and she could n't sleep , perhaps she switched on the light beside their double bed and opened a book , probably her Bible , a beautiful burgundy-leather King James my father had given her early in their marriage and that she kept close at hand . I loved to feel the cover and the onionskin pages that were tipped in gold and totally free of marginalia . The only mark I could find was a handwritten notation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things belong unto the Lord our God : but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever . " <p> Over the years Carolyn gave me many books that she felt I needed to read at particular stages of my life . Some she 'd bought on her travels ; some had belonged to her mother ; some had been gifts . She shared my passion for hand-me-downs , and never apologized for giving me used books . " Words do n't go bad , " she 'd say , " like cheese . Read everything you can get your hands on . Live inside them . " On the subject of my newfound love , she was adamant : " You 're too young to give it all up for a man . " Carolyn had married an older , stable , kind man who adored her yet allowed the space her inquiring mind demanded . " I 'm afraid you 're going to lose yourself , " she told me . " Besides , " she added , almost as an afterthought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't be able to put it down , " booksellers claim as they ring up your purchase . But of course you do , you must . The oven timer goes off , the children come in from school , your plane lands , the nurse calls your name , your lover kisses the back of your neck , your heavy eyes close in sleep . By the time you return to the book  --  if you return-you will be changed , will not be the same person you were ten days , or ten years , before . Life is a river , and you ca n't step into the same book twice . <p> One night after we 'd made love , he lit a cigarette and leaned back onto the pillows . " I 'm in trouble , " he said . " There 's this girl . " Smoke floated around his eyes ; he blinked , fanned the air . " Was this girl . It 's over , but she 's been calling . She says she 's pregnant . " Something hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could think was He will marry her , and I will lose him .... <p> " There 's this place in Mexico City , " he continued . " It 's nine hundred dollars for everything , to fly her there and back . I have two hundred . " <p> I had seen the word abortion in biology textbooks , but I had never uttered it . In 1969 , even at the crest of the free-love movement , it was not a legal option . I had fourteen hundred dollars in my savings account , all that was left of nearly two years of typing invoices at the print shop . Each Friday I had taken the little vinyl passbook to the bank window , where the cashier recorded the deposit , half of my paycheck . <p> " I 'll get the rest , " I said , surprising even myself . <p> " I ca n't ask you to do that . " <p> My next line was from a movie . Something out of the ' 40s . I should have been wearing a hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French cafe " You 're not asking . I 'm offering . " <p> " I 'll make it up to you , " he said . <p> To this day I ca n't recall if he repaid me . The passbook shows no record of the money being replaced . Within a year we were married , and what was left of my savings was pooled into a joint account . There was little money and much to buy  --  a dinette table , a TV stand , a couch . One night he suddenly sat straight up on that couch . " I 'll bet she was lying all along , " he said , as though continuing a conversation started just seconds before . " Maybe she just wanted a trip to Mexico . She probably spent the whole time on the beach . " I wanted to believe him . I hoped the girl had spent the weekend on the sand . I hoped she 'd gotten a tan . But I knew she had n't lied . I knew because of what had been set into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow over our marriage had first approached in the bank 's parking lot , had lengthened and darkened with each month , and has never completely lifted . <p> The girl 's name was Barbara . She had blue eyes and long brown hair , and she lived in Garden Grove with her parents . She had a lisp . That 's all he ever told me . The rest has been written in daylight imaginings and in dreams : Barbara and I are sitting beneath a beach umbrella reading books and sipping tall , cool drinks . The ocean is crashing in the distance , and the child crawling the space between our knees is a girl . She is a harlequin , seamed down the center . Not one eyelash , one fingernail , one cell of the child is his . She is the two best halves of Barbara and me , sewn with perfectly spaced stitches : This is the story I write . <p> Studying the markings in Evening Train , I surmise that the gray-haired woman is an honest reader , unashamed to admit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epiphanies , antiphonal , tessellations , serrations  --  and placed a question mark above each box . Maybe she 's merely an eager learner , the kind who sets small tasks for herself ; she will go directly to the dictionary and find these words . Or maybe someone  --  her husband , her lover , whoever broke her serviceable heart  --  also criticized her vocabulary . It was too small or too large . She asked too many questions . <p> In the poem about the breaking heart , she has underlined " in surface fissures " and " a web/ of hairline fractures . " She probably did n't even notice the fissures at first . Maybe , she guessed , this webbing is the necessary landscape of every marriage , each act of love . But reading on , I sense that more has been broken than a metaphorical heart . She has circled the entire poem " The Batterers , " about a man who , after beating a woman , dresses her wounds and , in so doing , begins to love her again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? / What if she stops breathing ? " I tell myself I would n't have stayed in that kind of situation . As it is , I 'll never know . He never hit me , though one night , desperate for attention , I begged him to . ( How do we live with the knowledge of our past selves ? ) He 'd come home late , at two or three o'clock , with no explanation . Earlier in the evening , returning from a night class and looking for clues to his absence , I 'd found a woman 's jacket behind a chair . It smelled foreign yet familiar  --  her musky perfume mingled with the memory of his cigarettes . They had been here together , in our apartment . He had not touched me in weeks . <p> When his fist finally flew , it landed on the door of the filing cabinet where I kept my class notes , term papers , and poetry drafts . This should not have surprised me . For months he 'd been angry that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove ? " he 'd ask . " Where do you think this is going to get you ? Just listen to yourself , ca n't you just hear yourself ? " Though I still worked part-time at the print shop , he spent whole days on the assembly line , drilling holes into bowling balls . Anything to make ends meet . He was hoping , beyond logic , that as a married man with a full-time job , he would be saved from Vietnam . He was terrified ; his draft number was low . <p> The force of the blow was audible : a thud , a crack . Loose sheets flew from the top of the cabinet . He cried out , then brought the fist to his mouth . Surely it was broken , I thought . I rushed toward him , but he held up his other hand to block me . Time slowed . White paper ' fluttered around me like birds . I stared at his hand , and something went out of me , I could feel it , a sucking force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment was over . He turned and walked away , his wounded fist still pressed to his mouth , his blue eyes filling . I knelt on the floor and began to gather the papers . My eyes were dry , my vision clear . This is what hurt the most : the clarity of the moment , its sharp focus . Each black word , on each scattered page , distinct and singular . <p> Two years ago , when Carolyn was dying , when she could count the remaining months on her fingers , she wrote from her home in Virginia , asking me to come as soon as possible to help her sort through her books . " You can have whatever you want , " she said . " The only thing I ask is that you do n't cry . Just pretend it 's a book sale . Come early , stay late . And go home with your arms full . " <p> It took two full afternoons . Too weak to stand , Carolyn sat on a little stool , pointing and nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth a memory . Her life 's story unfolded book by book . She told me she was glad she 'd lived long enough to see a grandchild safely into the world . She was glad I had found a husband who was good to me , this time , and she wished me all the happiness she had known . When my car could hold no more books , she handed me a large envelope and explained that one of her jobs as assistant librarian had been to check the returned books before reshelving them . The envelope was labeled in Carolyn 's scrawl : Woodrow Wilson Public Library , Things Found in Books . " You 'd be surprised at what people use as bookmarks , " she said . <p> When I got home , I emptied the envelope onto the floor , amazed at what spilled out . Bits and pieces of strangers ' lives , hundreds of markers of personal histories . Love letters , folded place-mats , envelopes , sympathy cards , valentines , handwritten recipes , train tickets , report cards , newspaper clippings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracts , swimming-pool passes , scratch-and-sniff perfume ads , canceled tickets for the bullfight , bar coasters , rice paper , happy money . Studying the bookmarks , I slid into each stranger 's life , wondering which book he had checked out and whether he had finished it . What calls us away from books , then back to them ? <p> When I am in pain , I devour books , often stripping the words of conceptual and metaphorical context and digging straight for the meat . The gray-haired woman seems to be doing the same thing , taking each word personally , too personally , as if Levertov had written them just for her , to guide her toward some terrible action . Certainly this was n't the poet 's intention , yet the more I study the markings , the more I fear what the woman is considering . In " Dream Instruction " she has underlined , twice , " gradual stillness , " but appears to have missed entirely the " blessing " in the lines that follow . The marks in " Contraband " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman by the hand and remind her of the poem 's symbolic level , a level that 's nearly impossible to see when you are in pain . Contraband , I would tell her , represents the Tree of Knowledge , the tree of reason , and the fruit is the words we stuff into our mouths , and yes , that fruit might indeed be " toxic in large quantities ; fumes/swirled in our heads and around us , " but those lines are not a prescription for suicide . There are other ways to live with knowledge . <p> For instance , you can leave , gather up what remains of yourself and set off on a journey much like the journey of faith Levertov writes of . Or , if that proves too difficult , you can send your self off on its own , wave good-bye , step back into childhood 's shoes and refuse to go one step further . You can cut off your hair , take the pills the doctors prescribe and beg for more , then lose yourself daily in a gauzy sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . His deferment dream did not materialize , so you have followed him to a military base where you know no one . Vietnam is still a possibility . Your heart is divided : You dread the orders yet pray for them . If they come , you will be able to retreat honorably to your parents ' home . In the meantime , you have the pills and the books and the bed grown huge by his nightly absence  --  he is sleeping elsewhere now , with someone else , and he no longer even tries to hide it . <p> If you 're lucky , one night your hand will find the phone , and if you are doubly lucky and have a mother like mine , she will arrive early the next day , having driven hundreds of miles alone in a car large enough to hold several children . Though she is a quiet woman who rarely interferes , in this case she will make an exception . She will locate your husband , demand that he come home , now , and when he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent yourself off somewhere ) , together they will lift you into the backseat of her big car and rush you to the emergency room , where the attending physician will immediately direct you to the psychiatric wing . <p> I would remember none of this part , which is a blessing . Had I recalled the details of the breakdown , I might have felt compelled to tell the story too soon , to anyone who would listen : strangers on buses , prospective employers , longtime family friends , men I met in bars or churches ( for months I would search both places , equally , for comfort ) . " There 's no need to tell , " my mother said after my release , and she would repeat this many times , long after I was out of danger . Though I 've finally decided , after nearly thirty years , to tell , I still hear her words in my head : " You do n't need any more hurt . It 's no one 's business but yours . " <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in need  --  food , comfort , time , love  --  there is a part of herself , the heart 's most enclosed , tender core , that she guards like a secret . In this way , and others , I would like to be more like her . Less needy , more protective of private fears and desires . Less prone to look back , more single-minded in forward resolve . Though I had rehearsed his leaving for months , when he finally went , for good this time ( is n't it strange how we use good to mean final ? ) , I was devastated , terrified to imagine my future . " What should I do , " I begged my mother . " What would you do ? " I do n't know what I expected her to say . My mother has never been one to give advice . Experience , in her view , is not transferable . It is not an inheritance you pass on to your children , no matter how much you wish you could . <p> If her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would read her life . Certainly there were worlds it could teach me : She had left her parents and the family farm to follow her husband from one military base to the next ; waited out his long absences ; buried one child and raised six others ; watched as loved ones suffered divorces , financial ruin , alcoholism , depression , life-threatening illnesses and accidents ; nursed them through their last years . " Take me with you , " I begged , meaning back home , to her home , to the nest she and my father had made . <p> My mother remembers this as one of the painful moments of her life . " I wanted more than anything to say yes , " she recalls . " But I knew if I did , you 'd never find your way . It was time you found your own way . " So she took my face in her hands and said No . No , I could not follow her , I could not come back home . Then she helped me pack my suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I would be safe if worse once again came to worst , she made me a plane reservation to my brother 's town in South Carolina . Half a world away , or so it seemed to me . <p> The narrator of Levertov 's Evening Train sets off on a journey too , and though I suspect that the luggage and racks of the book 's title poem are intended to be metaphorical , I can not help but feel the heft of the bags , the steel slickness of the racks . And as I study the phantom woman 's markings , it seems clear that , like mine , her journey required a real ticket on a real train or plane , and that by the time she arrived at the poem called " Arrived , " she had already sat alone in a room with " Chairs , /sofa , table , a cup  --  " and begun the inventory of her life . Was she , like the poem 's narrator , unable to call forth the face of the one she had left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " the shape/ of his head , or/color of his eyes appear/at moments , but I can't/assemble feature with feature " ? <p> In my pain , I prayed for such moments of forgetfulness . How pleasant it would be not to recall his hands , his tanned , furrowed forehead , the flame-cool blue of his eyes . My only release was to stuff my brain with cotton . That 's how it felt when I took the pills . Though they no longer had the power to put me to sleep , they lifted me to a place of soundlessness and ether . I thought of T. S. Eliot 's hollow men , their heads filled with straw . The image of scarecrows was comforting , as were thoughts of helium balloons , slow-floating dirigibles , and anything submerged in water . I was an aquarium , enclosed . Amniotic silence surrounded me hour after hour , and then suddenly  --  What 's that noise ? , I 'd think , startled , amazed to discover it was my own breath in my lungs , my heart thumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happened , when I was brought back to myself , I 'd think , No , please not that . I had forgotten for a while that I was alive , that there were hands at the ends of my arms , fingers that could burn themselves on the gas stove , the iron , the teakettle 's steam . The world was too much with me . Why bother ? ( This is the way the world ends ... ) I fell back into bed , finding comfort in Eliot , and later in Job . The New Testament was stuffed too full of promise and light , but Old Testament sufferings were redemptive , though not in the traditional sense of the word . I was long past questioning why a loving God would destroy Job 's house and cattle , afflict him with boils all over his body , and kill his children . The worst is yet to come , I thought  --  and almost said , aloud , to Job . Happiness is what you should be fearing . Why waste your breath talking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be worse than the disease . If God answers , out of the whirlwind and the chaos of destruction , beware of what will be given : healing , forgiveness , six thousand camels , a thousand she-asses , seven sons and three daughters , each fairer than the next , your life overflowing , another high place from which to fall . <p> I did n't want to live , but I could n't imagine dying . How to gather the energy ? I did n't own a gun and could see no way to get one . I had no courage for knives . Pills seemed an easy way out ; I tried , but my stomach refused to accept them . Over the next weeks I started taking long drives on country roads , staring at the yellow lines and thinking how easy it would be to pull the wheel to the left , into the oncoming truck , which was heavy enough , I was sure , to bear the impact without killing its driver . ( I did n't want to kill anyone , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a difference . ) Or better yet , pull the wheel to the right , into that stand of pine trees . <p> What terrified me was not the thought of the mangled metal , the row of wounded trunks , or even of the sheet pulled over me  --  a gesture that seemed almost a kindness , something a loved one would do . What terrified me that late-summer day was the sudden greenness of the trees , the way their beauty insinuated itself into my vision  --  peripherally at first , vaguely , and without my consent . I blinked to stop what felt like tears , which I had n't tasted for so long I 'd forgotten that they were made of salt , that they were something my body was producing on its own , long after I thought I had shut down . OK , I said to the steering wheel , the padded dashboard , the pines . If I can think of five reasons not to die , I wo n't . <p> When I got back to my room , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form I 'd been using as a bookmark . I found a pencil in the nightstand , one without an eraser , I recall . I remember thinking that I could n't go back on what I 'd written , could n't retrace my steps if I made a mistake . I turned the form over and numbered the blank side  --  1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5  --  with a black period after each , as if preparing to take a spelling test . It was the first time I 'd put pencil to paper since I 'd left California . I thought for a while , then wrote beside number one , " My parents , " immediately wishing I 'd split them into " Mother " and " Dad " so that I could have filled two lines . Then to my surprise the next four blanks filled quickly , and my hand was adding numbers and more numbers to accommodate the names of my siblings , my nieces and nephews , the handful of friends I still claimed and even the ones who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably could have filled another , but I did n't want to try , I could n't bear any more just yet  --  the stab of joy , the possibility . <p> As months passed , the world slowly continued to make itself known , appearing in small , merciful gestures , as if not wishing to startle : voices , a pair of hands , golden leaf-shadow , a suggestion of sky . Then one morning , for no reason I can recall , the world lifted her veil and showed her whole self . She looked strangely familiar  --  yes , I thought , it 's all coming back . Put on shoes , brush teeth , smile into the mirror , pour orange juice into a glass . This is the way the world begins . This is the way the world begins . This is the way . <p> I smooth the center seam of Evening Train and run my hands over the marked-up lines . Poems can be dangerous places in which to venture , alone , and I 'm not sure the woman is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic 's black cloth falling/ over our faces , over our breath . " Please do n't , I want to say . Do n't do it , do n't drink it , do n't eat that apple . I want to tell her about the pine trees , the list , Mother and Bessie and Carolyn and Wordsworth and Hopkins and Job . Look , I 'd say , pointing to the footnote . See , Mindwalk was a film by Bernt Capra , it 's not a real place ; do n't worry . It 's about Pascal and the Void . It does n't have to be about you . But it is , of course . That 's why she is not only reading the book but writing one of her own as well , with each scratch of the pencil . The printed words are Levertov 's , but the other poem is the woman 's  --  written in the margins , in the small boxes that cage the words she can not pronounce , in the crumbled erasures , in the question marks floating above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a crazy thought , but I ca n't help myself . Wait up ; I want to tell you something . <p> <p> By Rebecca McClanahan <p>
