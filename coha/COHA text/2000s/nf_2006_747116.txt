When disasters strike , ecological damage reverberates across regions , local outbreaks become transnational pandemics , environmental changes stress socities , and famines and drought feed into the complex and devastating logic of conflict . As a result , the distinction between natural and manmade disasters blurs . The interdependence of governments , civil society and international institutions becomes undeniable in the face of emergencies that are as devastating as any human-born conflict . In short , disaster is a fundamental element of globalization . <p> The Spring/Summer 2006 issue of the Journal of International Affairs takes inventory of the inadequacies of traditional approaches to disaster response and preparedness . Since 11 September 2001 , many governments , especially in developed countries , have been preoccupied with combating terrorism or bracing for attacks on their own soil . At the same time , the international community has acknowledged the plight of the world 's poorest and most vulnerable by making commitments to eliminate poverty , promote sustainable development and enhance social welfare in the Global South , as articulated by the UN Millennium Development Goals . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented in scale  --  the Indian Ocean tsunami , Hurricane Katrina and the South Asia earthquake  --  have garnered extensive media coverage and stretched thin the response capacities of governments and humanitarian aid organizations . The attendant consequences underscore the need to redefine conceptions of national security , environmental protection and public health , and to link disaster management to development strategies . <p> International forums such as the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe , Japan and the resulting Hyogo Protocol have attempted to bring policy attention to disaster risk reduction . Yet several barriers remain . For one , economic liberalization and deficiencies in political accountability tend to inhibit the incorporation of disaster risk management into mainstream policy and practice . However , as practitioners and administrators recognize a disaster 's complicating factors , technological and strategic advances provide hope for responding to future calamities , so long as the political will to do so exists . <p> More than offering a critique , then , our contributing scholars and practitioners explore efforts to create frameworks that locate natural catastrophes within the context of security and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by state and non-state actors in addressing the causes of these threats , and in building the capacity to tackle them when they materialize , with a view to restoring people 's lives in their aftermath . <p> To frame the issue , David Alexander provides a snapshot of the prevailing international modes of responding to calamity and assesses the prospects for major changes to these approaches . He posits that while the increasing reach of mass media and other technologies have raised international awareness of natural catastrophes and enabled mobilization of relief mechanisms , growing imbalances in global economic and political structures have exacerbated the impact of disaster . Although local self-sufficiency may form the basis for resilience before a disaster strikes , it is typically not until the aftermath of disaster that the international community provides the necessary resources . <p> The articles that follow address specific aspects of the so-called disaster management cycle : prevention , mitigation and preparedness ; relief and response ; and recovery and reconstruction . Nathan Hultman and Alexander Bozmoslki begin by situating what are perceived as singular and infrequent events , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global climate change . Using Bangladesh and the Netherlands as case studies along with a number of other geographic examples , the authors determine that distinct mitigation and preparedness efforts to alleviate the effects of normal disaster and climate change are each designed to augment resilience , and are therefore mutually reinforcing . To exploit this fortuitous alignment  --  that is , both to curb the advance of climate change and to adapt to the disruptions to which it gives rise  --  the authors recommend devolving decisionmaking authority to the local level , bolstering environmental protection and distributing risk among a variety of actors . <p> The employment of scientific knowledge and diagnostic tools for environmental risk assessment can not alone build resilience against the occurrence of sudden onset events . Jess M. Macas and Benigno E. Aguirre address the challenges that attend mitigation and preparedness for one type of such events , volcano eruptions , in Latin America . Their article revolves around case studies of five volcanic hazard scenarios in three countries in the region . The authors analyze the approaches of provincial and national emergency management actors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and militaries ' and governments ' roles in implementing early warning systems . The authors argue that the wholesale application of the UN Disaster Relief Organization 's volcanic emergency model , without regard to the customs and social networks of the affected population and without enlisting their participation sufficiently , has bred seemingly intractable problems of environmental refugees , weakened political institutions and undermined the viability of communities . <p> In a similar vein , Geoff O'Brien then draws our attention to flaws in the United Kingdom 's efforts at constructing a national emergency preparedness edifice for a wide range of events  --  a process that began as a response to a succession of floods , epidemics and economic and technological emergencies , such as the Y2K Bug , but was transformed by the September 11th and July 7th terrorist attacks in the United States and United Kingdom respectively . The government 's exclusive focus on the threat of terrorism has shifted attention from more comprehensive civilian protection schemes . Resilience , argues O'Brien , should be an inclusive process of societal adaptation , rather than just aimed at returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of violence constitute the primary threats to homeland security has directly affected planning for natural disasters , it is worth considering whether the reverse might also be true , or whether both aspects of civil protection exhibit shared or parallel patterns . To that end , Irwin Redlener and David A. Berman of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness examine trends in individual and family preparedness in the United States from the Second World War to the present using historical and post-September 11th survey data . The authors maintain that ever since Pearl Harbor , the federal government has led a national public readiness campaign that prioritizes manmade international threats . Nevertheless , they find that over the decades the public has remained unconvinced of the need to take measures to protect themselves . And despite fine-tuning , the message and an attempt to convey a more inclusive conception of disaster at various points in time , the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 have done little to overcome this disconnect . <p> While Redlener and Berman warn of the obstacles and limits to enlisting public participation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mely Caballero-Anthony of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore urges the development of institutional devices for increased involvement and coordination by a broad mix of state and non-state actors in tackling the transnational threat of infectious diseases in East Asia . Drawing on the lessons that the recent SARS epidemic holds for stemming the potential outbreak of a deadly avian influenza pandemic , Caballero-Anthony supports ongoing efforts to treat what were formerly considered medical and scientific matters as imminent and ominous security threats . However , because the spread of infectious disease in the region is interwoven with a variety of socioeconomic and demographic issues and precipitated by a lack of state capacity , surveillance mechanisms and other immediate measures are not sufficient . Thus , Caballero-Anthony recommends introducing an integrated " global public goods " approach to combating epidemics through sharing and diversifying responsibility in a manner somewhat analogous to Hultman 's and Bozmoski 's policy prescriptions . <p> Next , Alex de Waal reminds us that disaster prevention is the ultimate public good , but we have yet to systematize our knowledge of what factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework for the comparative political ethnography of disaster prevention , de Waal identifies four aspects of political incentives : visibility , political salience , constituency and the availability of technology for effective response . De Waal builds on his earlier studies of famine prevention and political contract to consider the HIV/AIDS epidemic . He provides an intriguing explanation as to " why national and international responses to HIV/AIDS have been surprisingly successful in mitigating the worst social and political impacts of the epidemic but have mostly failed in preventing HIV infection . " <p> Yet even if the political incentives for disaster prevention and mitigation are in place , the need to provide effective relief for sudden onset disasters is still critical . Arjun Katoch , Chief of the Field Coordination Support Section of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , overviews the system of international disaster response , the unique features of an emergency response environment and the challenges a whole new range of actors and stakeholders pose to on-scene coordination . Maintaining an effective international emergency relief capacity , Katoch argues , requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination mechanisms , creating guidelines for corporate involvement in disaster response , maintaining specialized knowledge in disaster preparedness and relief at the decisionmaking level and establishing a common fund for deploying resources as soon as disasters occur . <p> As acknowledged by many of our contributors , the question of " who evaluates the world 's disasters significantly influences how much attention those disasters receive . " And to command the world 's attention and hence donors ' attention requires capturing the media 's attention . In addressing the question of why the media cover some disasters and neglect others , Susan Moeller goes beyond simple explanations of staggering death tolls and the appeal of telegenic images . Simple emergencies lend themselves to self-evident , apolitical solutions . According to Moeller , it is " not consciousness of another 's pain that compels media attention ; rather , it is the media 's conviction that certain kinds of pain are fascinating for their public . " In order to command attention , pain must not overwhelm an audience to the point of helplessness . <p> Given the distorted consequences of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new strategies are needed to sustainably address populations ongoing vulnerability to disaster : Strategies that promote an effective and equitable system of international emergency aid . Joanna Syroka and Richard Wilcox argue that achieving this dual goal requires shifting from the current " reactive emergency aid business model " to a " proactive risk-management model . " In doing so , already impoverished and vulnerable populations are empowered to manage their ongoing risk through sophisticated investment and financial strategies rather than by relying on charity during an emergency . The authors explain current drought monitoring and weather derivative initiatives at the World Food Programme to illustrate this innovative model of disaster financing . <p> If , as many of our contributors argue , disaster response requires cooperation among a variety of actors at the local , national and international level , could the inverse be true  --  could disaster represent an opportunity for fostering international cooperation among traditional " enemies " ? This question frames the field of disaster diplomacy . In two disaster diplomacy case studies  --  India-Pakistan and Ethiopia-Eritrea  --  Ilan Kelman elucidates seven pathways that promote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster diplomacy does have a significant impact on interstate relations . Disaster " frequently catalyzes , but rarely creates , diplomacy . " <p> While disaster diplomacy focuses on bilateral relationships among enemy states , Frederick M. Burkle Jr . advocates reviving multilateralism and investing globally in disaster response . According to Burkle , " socially sustainable forms of disaster management " must meet the expectations of an increasingly global society . To understand the limitations and opportunities at this critical moment , Burkle explores the complex relationships among globalization , state capacity and public health . <p> From the call for a global investment in disaster response , we move to two commentaries on post-disaster reconstruction . With an extensive background in risk management at the World Bank , Margaret Arnold begins the discussion by addressing the challenges that face the current policy framework of reaction and recovery . In Arnold 's view , more could be done , particularly through the World Bank , to mainstream risk mitigation into development . Supporting her argument is the evident toll disasters take on the poor , who are by all measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The development paradigm should shift from one of temporary relief to permanent coping strategies . A key aspect of this strategy involves better livelihoods and housing conditions in impoverished communities . <p> Walden Bello brings an alternative perspective to the globalization of disaster with the " **25;2453;TOOLONG complex . " Bello argues that post-conflict and post-disaster reconstruction have become increasingly intertwined , to the point that the same actors with strikingly similar agendas arrive on the scenes in Baghdad and New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina . This blurring of lines suggests an infiltration of U.S. foreign policy in the realm of humanitarian aid , or " militant humanitarianism , " where neoliberal economics takes precedence . A complicit player in these relief quagmires , Bello argues , is the World Bank , which adds an interesting twist in light of Arnold 's postulations . <p> In the Andrew Wellington Cordier essay , Cary McClelland steps outside the disaster management cycle , demonstrating that the " natural " aspects of certain calamities are largely illusory . He charts the decline of post-colonial Zimbabwe 's formerly vibrant agricultural sector to highlight the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 . While famine is often described as a natural disaster brought on by drought and climate change , McClelland first levels criticisms on the failures of President Mugabe and the Zimbabwean government and second on the international aid community for the tragedy in Zimbabwe . <p> The issue concludes with a series of book review essays . In a review of Jared Diamond 's most recent work , Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed , Jack Goldstone explores the inverse relationship between societies ' initial resource endowments and later wealth . According to Goldstone , in the face of coming environmental disaster , societies must change their own long-established behaviors in order to conserve and replenish the resources necessary for their survival . Other reviews examine the challenge of establishing insurance markets to mitigate risk ; the U.S. public health system 's preparedness for an infectious disease outbreak ; the potential role of human-centered technologies in mitigating the risks of both manmade and natural disasters ; and disaster response management approaches and recovery strategies in the United States . <p> There may not yet be a practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that attend to both security and development imperatives around the world . While there exists considerable overlap in the conceptual frameworks and prescriptions put forth by a number of the authors , there continues to be a lively debate about new directions for the field . Empowering and mobilizing local communities , shifting resources from the post-disaster to pre-disaster phase , spreading risk and enhancing coordination , and insisting on a democratic and equitable spirit in allocating responsibility for the causes and consequences of disasters , are key themes running throughout this issue of the Journal . The globalization of disaster resonates with the most pressing international issues of our time : It encapsulates the expanding scale of natural catastrophes ; the necessarily interdependent nature of risk-reduction strategies ; and the ascendance of liberal market economics , with all the dislocations , vicissitudes and transformative prospects that it implies . <p> By The Editors <p>
