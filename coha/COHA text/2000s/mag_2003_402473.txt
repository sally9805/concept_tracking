A MODEST HAMPTONS HOUSE THAT ARCHITECT CHARLES GWATHMEY DESIGNED FOR HIS PARENTS ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO SET THE COURSE OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER . NOW IT 'S BECOME HIS OWN . // It 's not easy , at the start of summer 2003 , to think back to a time when building a house in the Hamptons was a relatively simple proposition : before land became scarce ; before a stockade of privet was the only guarantee of privacy ; before the local landscape became , in the words of architecture critic Paul Goldberger , " a pedestal on which to place striking objects . . . an architectural stage . " It was at the tail end of this time , the mid-sixties , that Charles Gwathmey designed a dazzling and concise house for his parents , artists Robert and Rosalie Gwathmey . Since then , and despite an unending architectural vernissage on the eastern end of Long Island , the Amagansett getaway built by a twenty-six-year-old rookie has become arguably the best-known house in the Hamptons . " It 's really a house about presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , which marked his recent renewal of the place for himself and his wife , Bette-Ann . Though he was speaking in architectural terms , he 's right on several counts . The 1,200-square-foot house has an expansive presence because it contains everything that is essential and nothing that is extraneous . His parents ' presence is still tangible in the furniture plan and in the art hanging on the walls . Finally , the house , which quickly became a stylistic icon , announced Gwathmey 's presence on the architecture charts , where he has remained ever since . " Beginning his career with a landmark , Charles has not rested on his laurels , " his friend Robert A. M. Stern correctly observes . By now , Gwathmey and his longtime partner , Robert Siegel , have designed more than fifty houses , many for titans of business and entertainment to whom " small " is anathema . " It 's about content , not size , in the end , " says the architect , rookie no longer . Town &; Country : In 1964 your parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amagansett , New York . Charles Gwathmey : It was my mother 's idea . She and my father had been out there many times , visiting artist friends . One day , my mother and I drove to the end of Long Island , and we found this one-acre lot in Amagansett that she could afford . It was $7,500 , totally flat , and it had an unobstructed view of the ocean across the dunes . We also saw a dune site in Southampton , with the bay on one side and the ocean on the other-it was $35,000 . We could n't afford it and have enough money left to build the house . So I said I could build a great house on a flat piece of land , and that was it . T &C:; What was the budget ? CG : My mother had $50,000 total . Seventy-five hundred dollars went to the land , $35,000 to the house , and whatever was left paid for the furniture and " landscaping . " That was a lawn . T &C:; And the brief ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom for Bob and me , a living room/dining room/kitchen that , combined , will make a great space , and then make some small bed-rooms for you and whatever happens to you . " My father 's studio building came a year later , after he retired from Cooper Union and they 'd moved out there full-time . He was a painter and teacher ; my mother was a photographer and textile designer . T &C:; What an adjustment it must have been for them after so many years in Manhattan . CG : They loved Amagansett . It was a change , but it was still close enough that they could come into the city to go to the theater and museums . The house was full of people all the time . God , my mother cooked phenomenal meals for dinner parties in that little kitchen , unbelievable . My parents would have intimate dinners with their friends , everyone sitting around in the living room because there were too many to fit at the table . And they 'd have huge fund-raising parties . I was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always called upon because they were so supportive of social causes . The house became the focus of these events . There were times when 300 people would be on the lawn , listening to my father as he stood on the balcony , making a speech with Alger Hiss . No kidding . It was , in that sense , a communal place . T &C:; And a place for you as well ? CG : I spent a tremendous amount of time out there once the house was built . Bette-Ann and I slept in the studio , and the bunk rooms downstairs worked for the children the couple had four . My parents ' company was the best . I was their only child-I loved them and was close to them up to the end . T &C:; How did they react to the building 's design when they first saw it on paper ? Were they constructive critics ? CG : They truly loved it , both the idea and the reality . My father always said , " If I charged a dollar for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have paid the taxes for the whole time we lived here . " T &C:; He became a tour guide . CG : He did . Anyone who drove up , he 'd invite them in , offer them a drink , give them my book and thank them for visiting . He was so incredibly proud of me , as was my mother . And as my parents got older , the house was there for them . They moved there in 1965 ; my father died in 1988 , and my mother in 2001 . So my mother spent almost forty years there . T &C:; When your mother bought the land , you were twenty-five and just back from a year in Europe on a Fulbright grant . You 'd started working in the New York office of Edward Larrabee Barnes . Did you question the timing ? CG : If you believe in your creative potential and an opportunity is presented , the obligation to take the risk is non-negotiable . Your talent is either going to prove out or not . The only way you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the risk . When you 're young , you 're uncontaminated-you do n't have all the accumulated pressures , and you 're clearheaded , singularly focused . The burden is simply to make a good work . T &C:; Still , it must have been daunting . CG : The cheapest bid I got from a contractor was for seventy grand . I had thirty-five , right ? So I decided to quit my job and build the house myself . My mother trusted me-she just put the money in the bank , and it was my job to pay the bills and build . The obligation was huge , not only to her , but in knowing that the responsibility was all mine . I 'd had a terrible stammer all my life , and the manifestation of it at that time was that I could n't initiate a phone call to a stranger . At work , I had to con secretaries into making calls for me . But when I became responsible for the house , I had to research , make calls about materials-and 1 stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty great . T &C:; So you became a loquacious contractor . CG : Well , I found three young contractors from Brooklyn-John Caramagna , John Barbagallo and Sam Castorina-who agreed to come out and work with me . We rented a dilapidated old house in East Hampton that we called Tobacco Road-it was right across the street from where the restaurant Nick &; Toni 's is now . John Caramagna 's mother lived with us and cooked our meals . We 'd work during the week , and then they 'd leave on the weekends to go back to their wives , and I 'd be left to clean up the site . They also gave me chores to do . My father would come out and help me . He wanted to be a part of it-he loved it . It was as if he and I were making it together . T &C:; Were you always close ? CG : We were . He always had a painting studio at home when I was young , wherever we lived . I 'd spend time with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about life . When I was a boy , my father could n't wait , on one level , for me to become his contemporary . I was still his little boy , of course , but he was impatient-he wanted me to grow up faster . At eleven , I told my parents that I wanted to be an architect . I did n't think I could draw as well as my father , and I was n't sure about photography . But I could make things , and I liked the idea that buildings endured . They were sculptural ; you could walk inside them . The whole architectonic nature of sculpture and of art in general was integral to buildings , and so it seemed to me , naively , to be related to what both my mother and my father did . T &C:; When you were abroad on the Fulbright , you set yourself the task of visiting as many Le Corbusier buildings as you could . What did you apply from that experience to your parents ' house ? CG : Two things . Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was his reinterpretation of the Renaissance 's golden mean , applied to man 's occupation of space . He was able to define the proportional system and assign it actual dimensions , which could then be applied to buildings , maintaining a harmonic unity . I studied and researched it , and when I visited the buildings , it all came true . So the notion of having a dimensional , geometric and proportional grid system as a tool was very important to me and always has been . I applied it rigorously in my parents ' house , in both plan and section . Every one of Corbu 's buildings is humanly scaled , no matter how big or complex , whether it 's a house , a chapel or a monastery . The understanding of your relationship to space , and then its sculptural transformation , was a compelling and inspiring revelation . T &C:; There are few interior walls or doors in the Amagansett house . CG : The zoning is sectional , vertical . Privacy is attained not by walls , in other words , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a covered porch and an entry space , originally two bunk rooms . The second floor , the piano nobile , is the public floor : **26;525;TOOLONG . And then the top balcony floor is the master bedroom " studio , " the classic modern section overlooking the double-height space . The spatial variation in the house , the balance between solid and void , and the way the geometric forms come together all contribute to a composition that is simultaneously revealed on the exterior and interior . T &C:; Walking around the house is like watching a dancer 's rotation-there is no clear beginning or end . CG : When you experience it , you do n't sense the actual size because of its spatial continuity , both horizontally and vertically . People say , " It feels so huge , it ca n't be just 1,200 square feet . " That 's because of its volumetric and vertical continuity . I think the fascination is to understand its smallness and then realize that it 's about content , not size . It has been reduced to its essentialness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no negative perception that it 's small . It 's a reverse perception , both psychologically and literally . It 's really a house , an architecture , about presence . T &C:; The budget , though , was small . CG : The budget was very tight . But I 've always believed-and this is a formal strategy also - that constraints are opportunities . If you have constraints , you 're forced to invent . If you want to make something unique , a budget constraint is as legitimate as having one acre-which we also had , by the way-as opposed to ten . T &C:; And the use of cedar cladding on the exterior and the interior : was that a budget choice ? It has a surprising elegance . CG : Well , it enabled me to have a real material that would weather next to the ocean . It allowed a kind of precision and " no detail . " It 's all detail , in a way , but it 's self-trimming and self-finishing , thus one process . Measure it , cut it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the least expensive way to have done it , but it transformed the scale because it was both outside and inside , which changes the perception of what the space is . You 're walking through and around a sculpture , where the perceptual separation of inside/outside is ideally nonexistent . The continuity is critical . If the outside were cedar and the inside were plaster , it would have been a totally different perceptual experience and would have changed the ethic . T &C:; When you decided in 2001 that you 'd renovate the house for yourself , did you struggle with the idea of remaining true to your parents ' brief ? CG : When you come back to an original , there are really three ways to play it : one , you do n't change anything ; two , you do n't violate the formal idea but elaborate ; or three , add without compromising , add by enriching . I chose the second strategy , which is to say that the basic volume , forms and disposition held , and by adding four critical new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light and site extensions . These windows were integral to the whole site restructuring . T &C:; The site was contiguous with surrounding lots ; you chose to frame it . CG : The idea of hedging the entire site and making it all grass-no paths , no driveway-was an abstract transformation because it made a green room . I could n't do it before - my father thought hedges were bourgeois , and he hated privet . Now it 's an outdoor room in which two objects are placed and appear to float . The house and studio have more presence , and the dialogue between the buildings is more intense . The site feels incredibly calm . T &C:; In rethinking the house , you did n't want more than 1,200 square feet ? CG : Actually , I wanted less . It 's really down to a one-bedroom house now . I had the idea of giving up the ground-floor bunk rooms and making an entry space . It can always be reconverted to bunk rooms , right ? And then there is the guest bedroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that up as a work space . It has deep memories for me . My father and I spent a lot of real time together there . T &C:; Did revisiting the house in such an intimate way put you back in touch with who you were in the mid-sixties ? CG : It was a very important kind of continuity in the history of my family . My mother and father were great parents , teachers and friends . And the house is stabilizing for me , as well as a legacy . I remember being out there with the children on cold winter weekends , bundling up and walking on the beach . We 'd get back around four-thirty in the afternoon , when it was getting dark , and we 'd visit with my parents , their grandparents . My father would pour himself a vodka and tomato juice , the kids would have their games to play , and we 'd sit around the dining table , talking . Then we 'd all take naps , and my mother would cook a great dinner . The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that I 'd be very sad at the house and not able to get past missing my parents . Going back and living there was an emotional unknown . But I 've found the reality , and the experience of rethinking it , most comforting and transforming . T &C:; Physical transformation has also taken place-you 've upgraded quite a few of the materials . CG : Over the years , the cedar had weathered to a dark gray . The floor was always gray as well , and the cabinets were white . The whole idea was to make the house lighter and more abstract by making it more tonally harmonious , using natural materials : cedar , maple , stainless steel and white marble . Bette-Ann was a very positive instigator and critic , constantly questioning me to determine my convictions . We re-cedared the entire house , inside and out , and mixed a softer , light beige/gray stain . Then our decision to use maple and stainless steel for the cabinets , rather than reinstall white ones , provoked the idea of a white honed-marble floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new texture and density , as well as an abstract graphic for the entire house . T &C:; The circular staircase , which your father painted black , became white , too . CG : That was a big decision . It drove me crazy . I said to myself , " The stair connects all the floors that are white , but it 's not made of marble ; it 's steel . " Finally , I decided , " Forget being literal to the materiality , because this , in the end , is not about that . This is about an idea . " The concept of connecting all the floors by making the stair white was absolutely right . But I painted it three different times to evaluate and eliminate options . Then I added color elsewhere-the yellow transom , the blue handrails , the red corner-window mullion and the green vertical mullion-as an homage to Reitveld and Mondrian . The way these linear elements play against the white and the natural woods is a hierarchical enrichment , just a notation of color , which is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of the composition . T &C:; You 've said that you 're not crazy about the idea of revisiting your own houses in renovations for other people . CG : Coming back to houses I 've designed is hard , because I design them for one patron and then may be invited back by new owners who have a whole different agenda . It 's difficult intellectually and pragmatically . Gut it 's different when you do it for yourself and when it 's from your parents . I had an obligation , in an intellectual sense , to revisit and ask , " Has this house truly held up as a creative work ? " Re-proving that was important to me . Coming back to this project also confirmed that the principles of modernism and the strategies I 've worked through over the years have endured . You know , it was like going back to college . It was also a risk ; I could have screwed it up . T &C:; Were you afraid of that ? CG : A little , yes . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question yourself . And the pressures on me now , professionally , are so much more complex . But I think it purged me-it was like a steam bath . It actually re-energized me . I still love to design houses , and having new opportunities allows me to be focused and engaged . T &C:; There 's a new sharpness . CG : Yes , I think that 's true . It feels good . And you know , this is the first time I 've owned a house . I 'm no longer possessionless . It 's sort of an anchor now , in the best sense of the word . I have the history , the memories and the future . Sidebar " People are very interested in the house again , " says Gwathmey , on the lawn with his wife , Bette-Ann , and two of their salukis . " Ralph and Ricky Lauren were here , and Ralph said , ' This looks like it was done yesterday . It is meaningful and spiritual and feels new . It 's thirty-eight years old .
