<p> DOT-COMS SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE <p> Editor  --  I must disagree with Beryl Magilavy 's remarks ( Letters , June 13 ) about the digital industry . This industry , where more than 25 percent of the professionals do not have college degrees , should be supported , not suppressed . The entry-level positions generated by the Internet industry enable our home-grown job seekers to get the skills and experience necessary to build real careers rather than simply move between placeholder jobs . With light-manufacturing and other blue-collar sectors experiencing similar declines across the country , San Francisco is fortunate to be the incubator of this new industry , which employs people across the socioeconomic spectrum . <p> Attempts to chokeoff the Internet industry , as suggested by Ms. Magilavy and other anti-growth activists , are misguided . Our city is much better served by managing the industry 's impacts for the good of our community . We can do this by requiring the industry to pay its fair share of the costs that result from growth and by directing development to appropriately zoned areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do : impose a housing impact fee higher than that paid by any other industry in San Francisco , and permit industry development only in certain areas suited to such growth . Supervisor Katz has been an advocate for sustainable development and the digital industry for many years , long before her employment at a dot-com . By attempting to undermine Supervisor Katz 's credibility , Ms. Magilavy demonstrates that she can not win on the issues . <p> BILLY BLATTNER <p> San Francisco <p> INDIA BASIN SITE <p> Editor  --  Bay Center proponents turned away from Pier 45 need to know they have another option . The PG &E; Hunters Point power plant , located near Pier 98 at India Basin on San Francisco Bay , is scheduled to shut down in about 18 months . Some of this 30-acre site would be perfect for the Bay Center . In fact , the neighborhood has proposed a similar environment education center at this location for several years . Talk about making lemons into lemonade . <p> Take a major source of bay pollution , add creativity , the result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay . Actually , this site has advantages over the Pier 45 site : Heron 's Head Park ( owned by the port ) and India Basin Shoreline Park ( owned by Rec . &; Park ) flank the power plant . Both have recreational facilities and water access . The site is right on the Bay Trail , which rings all nine counties and makes for plenty of awareness . Buildings and infrastructure are in place . The area has great weather . There is an urgent need for some tourism dollars in the neighborhood . Two major bus lines serve the site . There is a parking lot . People could arrive by boat ! What more can any San Franciscan want ? Come on down and check it out . <p> JILL FOX <p> Friends of India Basin <p> San Francisco <p> MONSTER HOME <p> Editor  --  The hearing on the Alta Street/Grace Marchant Garden project will take place tomorrow before the Landmarks Board , at Room 400 in City Hall , starting at 3:15 p.m . <p> The project , which is now being proposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grace Marchant Garden . It would cantilever out over the Sansome Street cliffs . It would be tremendously larger than any of the nearby contributory homes in the historic district . And it would also be tremendously larger than its immediate neighbors . <p> JOE LUTTRELL <p> San Francisco <p> CRUDE BEHAVIOR <p> Editor  --  Thank you for the article , " Emerging From a Secret , " by staff writer Stacy Finz in the June 12 edition of The Chronicle . Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgendered ( GLBT ) youth in schools are constantly faced with taunts , slurs and physical attacks . Yet , when concerned citizens try to change district policies , all too often they face indifference , or outright harassment . <p> When confronted with reports of such crude behavior as faced by the student in your story , all too often conservatives and uncaring school administrators respond that including sexual orientation in schools ' anti-harassment policies promotes homosexuality and offends parents . What I find offensive is that GLBT students get beat up so that parents can feel smug in their prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives can know that school districts are " safe . " When critics say that anti-harassment policies promote homosexuality , are n't they saying that beating and taunting GLBT students is acceptable ? <p> You can beat us up , call us names , and we will still be who we are . Maybe if more school districts face lawsuits over their brutal environment for GLBT youth who just want to learn , other districts will start paying attention . <p> PETER GROSS <p> Denver <p> ACCEPTABLE BIAS <p> Editor  --  As a graduate of Live Oak High School and Martin Murphy Middle School , I was very disappointed to hear of the allegations being made by Alana Flores regarding anti-gay discrimination taking place at these two schools . I was also not very surprised . Had the attacks on Alana been based on her race or religion , or even nothing at all , I feel that the school , and the entire town , would have been outraged and would have demanded an end to it all immediately . <p> Sadly , discrimination based on one 's sexual orientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being acceptable . Whether it is in the form of an openly anti-gay speech made by church leaders , or inaction on the part of a school 's administration ( which seems to be the case here ) , our society is putting forth the message that it is OK to attack someone for being gay , because being gay is wrong . How is this form of discrimination any different from racial or religious discrimination ? <p> In either case , it is blind hatred for someone based on who they are , not for something that they have done or have the power to change . I applaud Alana and the other students for having the courage to stand up , both for themselves and for the countless others who decided not to fight . We should all stand up against the hatred , including that which we harbor in ourselves , even if we do n't care to admit it . <p> ANDREW M. SMITH <p> Walnut Creek <p> RUINED BY SUCCESS <p> Editor  --  I read , with some amusement , the article written by Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a resident of some 25 years , I have thoughts on the matter that I wanted to share . The Fourth of July celebration in Bolinas has been a fun time for all in the time that I have lived here , with anyone welcome to participate and watch . After all , it is a national holiday . The problems that have forced the cancellation this year have been growing for several years , and last year was just the straw that broke the camel 's back . <p> People coming from out of town in such numbers that ambulances and fire trucks ca n't get through the streets , litter left all over town and on the beach , and last year , mobs of young people , some of whom were drunk , wandering the streets and getting into fights until well after 2 o'clock in the morning . I , for one , will miss Annie Crotts singing the national anthem to start the parade , the tug-of-war with Stinson Beach across the channel , and the other goings-on of the day . But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the festivities can again become a family-style celebration of the Fourth of July and not a drunken street party . <p> Not everyone who attended last year was rowdy or unruly . On the contrary , during the day , it was most pleasant , if not a little crowded . The problems arose after the festivities of the day and continued well into the night , culminating with a fight in front of the bar and the street being cleared by seven police officers . Even then , the crowd that was left only moved down onto the beach and kept on partying . That part of our celebration I will gladly give up . <p> CHRIS KNOWLES <p> Bolinas <p> LIBERATION <p> Editor  --  Maureen Dowd could have boiled her entire piece down to one sentence . She nailed it with , " Women 's liberation now means being liberated from stereotypes about what women want . " This is the only relevant statement in her column and the only sentence any of us need to use from now on . <p> Women constitute more than half the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as a group , yet print media and airwaves are continually flooded with such drivel . It 's been a century , for crying out loud ! Enough already . <p> PENELOPE FLOOR <p> Moss Beach
