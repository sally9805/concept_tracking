They give no warnings . They leave few clues . But a band of environmental terrorists , which has left a trail of destruction across the Western and Midwestern U.S. for the past three years , is making no secret of its ambition to wage a wider war . In recent weeks it has struck on the East Coast , hitting targets on New York 's Long Island . <P> The group , which calls itself Earth Liberation Front , has claimed responsibility for setting fire to three luxury homes under construction on an old peach farm in the historic town of Mount Sinai . The fires caused moderate damage , and the ELF later claimed responsibility in a faxed statement to the Associated Press . But investigators on site in New York did n't need a communique .

Even a self-proclaimed ELF spokesman in Portland says he merely passes on anonymous messages . <P> A grand jury in Portland is investigating attacks in the West , and the FBI 's Joint Terrorist Task Force has joined the New York investigation . Says an FBI official : " We certainly hope we 're not seeing the beginning of a trend . " <P>  --  By David S. Jackson
