Memorial Day , 1964 The marshals looked like ordinary men . They were not in good shape , they did not have wary eyes . Their man was not handcuffed to either of them , and when the steak was served they ate with appetite . Both men took the beer that was offered . After dinner they drank Scotch . They drove a blue car , not a black one ; an Impala . They bit corn off the cob in a yard full of old trees : holly , sycamore , oak , pine . A hill sloped down to a creek , more than that , a small channel , wide and deep enough for pleasure boats to come back and forth and dock in the slips . Each yard had a slip , and at this house a Boston Whaler was tied up . The hostess was young , about twenty-eight or twenty-nine , and pretty , with blond streaks in her hair and the top pulled back and pinned . She wore a Chinese jacket with silk frog closures . And when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , looked to the gap left between those closures for a glimpse of her lacy brassiere . The other marshal was thinking of his boy . His son was slow in school and might have to go to summer classes . The marshal and his wife fought about this . At every chance , each hit the other surely and swiftly with the evidence that the boy 's poor progress could be traced back to the accused . The marshal believed his wife 's slow brain cells had diluted his own good stock and produced a son who could n't think his way out of the first grade . The second man watched the pretty hostess with some pleasure . When their ward got up from the plastic latticework of his recliner andwalked up the back steps to the porch , neither marshal blinked . The hostess refilled their glasses from a small bar set away from the heat of the grill . More Scotch . The evening was warm , and a velvet light settled on the lawn and the trees . At nightfall , they 'd be leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the house . Their two children , William Junior and Ann LouiseBo and Lou-Loustayed out on the lawn under the care of the next-door neighbors , the Maguires . The marshal with the slow son looked at the two children lying a short distance away on grass as smooth as a carpet . The children had their cheeks to the blades of grass , and when they pressed their faces , small hectic weaves imprinted there . They were listening to the worms . They could hear the rumble of earth moving . The boy 's eyes were red with blood , more than bloodshot , almost filled where the whites should be . When his sister looked at him , confirming the loud worms , she looked beyond those terrible bruises and her brother laughed , then coughed . There are worse things than being stupid , the marshal thought . And he had the first kind thought for his wife in some time . He thought of her pregnant , visiting her folks on another Memorial Day when he 'd been working , what else . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of a long , tedious day with a felon who could n't keep his mouth shut . A foul-tongued sick fuck . The marshal 's mind was dead . He rode the local train down through about a hundred shore towns and arrived in Manasquan . His mother-in-law , stout as a bull , met him at the station in the green Chevrolet . In the driveway , his father-in-law had the saw out . The stogie in his mouth was soaked . He bobbed his head toward the side yard . Behind the honeysuckle , the marshal 's wife sat on the low , thick branch of an oak tree , but stillhe ran . What do you think you 're doing ? She yawned , in no danger . He could see the shape of her belly , a white pear that erased completely , for the time being , all the things the felon had said , and he was so grateful to her he held out his hand for her swinging leg and kissed her heel and ankle and her toes all around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay Clemens saw the cake would take a while to thaw . When she first got the word that Will was coming home for a visit , she bought a cake , then froze it , because they might be late and the cake would dry out . But they were right on time and now everyone would be drunk before she could serve it . It might be good if her husband was drunk , good and bad . Eight weeks since he 'd been home . He did n't even like cake . What was she thinking . She wandered through the house , a long ranch style , with a layout of airy , sunny , low-ceilinged rooms , interweaving one into the next : dining , living , study , guest , master , and here he was , sitting head in his hands at the edge of his side of their bed , just as he used to sit most mornings waiting for black coffee in a mug . She was up at six anyway , on her third cup by the time he stirred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did his day begin ? Will ? she said . Dear heart . But her husband did not move . She sat beside him on the bed and smoothed down the silk jacket and tucked her hands beneath her thighs and waited . She stood up and listened in the doorway . She closed the door , flipped down the little hook lock . She sat beside her husband again and placed a hand against the curve of his neck . The smell of his clothing was so sharp , a desperate clean , and she thought about finding a shirt that was softer , a golf shirt maybe , from the drawerful he had , maybe something blue . She thought of his shirts but held still . She could smell the soap he used , which had no perfume , a kind of scent like shoe polish in a tin . Her husband did n't say anything . She withdrew her cheek and hands , and started with the frog closures on her jacket . Her husband released his head from his palms and , still looking down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black embroidered sandal . He watched her fingers push at the knots , then watched as she dropped the jacket back off her shoulders to the bed . She sat still , not doing anything , wearing the kind of brassiere she often wore , a full-coverage affair that clasped at the waist level in the back . Her belly rounded out just beneath the stiff ruff . She unzipped her black silk toreador trousers . Lifted her bottom off the bed just long enough to shimmy them off her hips . Dropped the trousers down to her sandaled feet . Started to lift her feet , then left them there , swaddled in black . She looked at the puddle of fabric . He looked at her ribbed , cinched waist . He looked to the cups , a bull's-eye effect in stitching , and her shoulders , rounded slightly , not interrupted by bone . Outside the door , there was a commotion coming toward them , like a beehive cracked open and the bees gaining volume and density , they could hear footsteps coming through the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maguire was knocking lightly on the door . Kay , she said . She kept the syllable tight , deliberately unemphatic . Kay heard Gert 's footsteps move away from the door . And quickly , quickly , back into her clothes , God , now , not everything buttoned . A frantic back look to her husband , and she was pressing hard at the hook on the door . Gert stood in the front foyer beyond the small corridor that led to the master suite . Red Maguire was on the phone with the pediatrician , who 'd meet them at the hospital ; the ambulance was already on the way , and the men who drove it , men Kay Clemens routinely brought gifts to , New York strip steaks by the dozen . Past Gert , and followed by Gert , out through the living , dining , pantry , kitchen , porch to the yard to her son , Bo , held steady in the arms of a United States marshal . Down two steps , her frog clasps not quite done but who was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him from the man , brought her baby into her arms , her boy whose eyes were not quite closed . He was not conscious , How long , she said , how long ? It would be the first thing anyone needed to know . The ambulance made its rude , loud way , backing up the gravel drive , backing onto the grass , and the emergency team , her friends , were beside her , oxygen first , then a stretcher . Kay kissed her daughter , Lou-Lou , who did not cry , and glanced at Gert to arrange all things in that glance : her daughter 's homework , sleep , school the next day . And then she stepped into the back of the ambulance in time to see the heart monitor register a beat strong enough , strong enough at least for her son to make it in time , once again , to the hospital . They would go local then , the next day , move him to New York . Will Clemens stood at the top of the brick step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks on the lawn , and his mouth twisted , he pressed the heel of a hand to his eye . Lou-Lou moved toward her father . One marshal put his hands in his pockets , took them out , then slipped past Will on the steps to make a phone call in the kitchen . When he came back , he said to the marshal with the interest in Kay 's brassiere : Let 's take a look at the water . The two walked down the gentle slope past the sycamore trees to watch the pleasure boats return at sundown to their slips . When the marshals climbed back up the hill after a protracted observation of a thirty-five-foot trimaran , Will and Lou-Lou were seated on the screened porch . The Maguires tidied up . They dismantled the grill , collapsed the bar , wrapped the leftovers , loaded the dishwasher . The marshals both needed to use the facilities , and Gert directed them to the children 's bath through the den . One looked over the bookshelves while waiting for his partner : all leather-bound sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A big television , cabinet console . Three golf trophies , the type a club gives for no real reason . The marshals traded places . In the yellow bathroom , almost by rote , the second man slid open the mirrored medicine cabinet : a battalion of clear plastic , all made out to the boy in care of the mother , more than he 'd ever seen in a home , this was extraordinary . He did n't touch any but bent closer to read the dates , dosages , then drew the mirror closed . The house was so quiet . The street too . A cul-de-sac without a lot of traffic . It was getting dark . The marshals made their way back to the porch . So , we 'll give it a minute . They sat down at the glass-top table , both folding their hands as if in casual prayer . Will swatted at something buzzing around his head . In the twilight , the Maguires were walking through the pine trees , across the yards , already pretty far gone . Lou-Lou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached around , pulled her closer . Will did n't watch . The insect had his full attention . No one spoke . Ten , fifteen minutes passed this way . The phone rang . Will sat still . The marshal stood , looked at Will , then crossed to the door and into the house . He picked up on the seventh ring . Yes , sir . Got it . Okay . Okay . Yes , sir . Goodbye . He stood in the door frame , All right , we 're going to the hospital , and he nodded several times . Will said , Oh God , and tried not to cry , and said , Two seconds , and went back through the kitchen , dining room , living room , den to the children 's bath , opened the same mirrored cabinet and emptied one vial from an uppermost shelf into the stiff paraffin-scented pocket of his shirt . They closed the doors , snapped out the lights . Will sat in the backseat of the blue car without restraint . He thought he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out of the drive . The marshal on the passenger side fumbled with the spinning top , reached out to attach it to the roof . This took a moment or two . At the end of the road , the driver released the siren . They ran every light .
