Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS What are the president 's ties to the bin Laden family and the Saudi royals ? Two years after the towers fell on September nth , Bush still has n't come clean <p> I 'M NOT INTO CONSPIRACY THEORIES , EXCEPT THE ONES THAT are true or involve dentists . I believe that all dentists must have gotten together at some point and decided that the real money was in root canals and full sets of X-rays every time you go in . No other mammal in the animal kingdom has to go through this . <p> The questions I have about the attacks on September nth , however , are not about how the terrorists got past our defense system , or how they were able to live in this country and never be detected , or how all the Bulgarians who worked at the World Trade Center got a secret communiqu to not show up to work that day , or how the towers came down so easily when they were supposedly built to withstand earthquakes , tsunamis and truck bombs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special commission investigating September 11th was supposed to answer . But the very formation of that commission was opposed by the Bush administration and Republicans in Congress . Reluctantly , they finally agreed - but then they tried to block the investigative body from doing its job by stonewalling it on the evidence it sought . <p> Why would n't the Bush people want to find out the truth ? What were they afraid of ? That the American people would learn that they screwed up , that they were asleep at the wheel when it came to terrorist threats , that they belligerently ignored the warnings from outgoing Clinton officials about Osama bin Laden simply because they hated Clinton ( Sex ! Bad ! ) ? <p> The American people are a forgiving lot . They did n't hold it against Franklin Roosevelt when Pearl Harbor was bombed . They did n't shun John F. Kennedy over the Bay of Pigs fiasco . And they still do n't care that Bill Clinton had those forty-seven people mysteriously murdered . So why , after this monumental breakdown of national security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very least , stop preventing the truth from coming out ? <p> Perhaps it 's because George &; Co. have a lot more to hide beyond why they did n't scramble the fighter jets fast enough on the morning of September nth . And maybe we , the people , are afraid to know the whole truth because it could take us down roads where we do n't want to go . <p> Though I myself was filled with the healthy skepticism that is required for a citizen in a democracy , I also shared the basic mind-set held by most Americans in the fall of 2001 : Osama did it , and whoever helped him with it must be tracked down and brought to justice . I hoped that this was what Bush - was doing . <p> And then one night in November 2001 , as I lay in bed , half asleep , reading an article in " The New Yorker by investigative journalist Jane Mayer , I stumbled across a paragraph that made me sit up and read it again , because I could n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen other American-based members of the bin Laden family , most of them here to study in colleges and prep schools , were said to be in the United States at the time of the attacks . The New York Times reported that they were quickly called together by officials from the Saudi Embassy , which feared that they might become the victims of American reprisals . With approval from the FBI , according to a Saudi official , the bin Ladens flew by private jet from Los Angeles to Orlando , then on to Washington , and finally to Boston . Once the FAA permitted overseas flights , the jet flew to Europe . United States officials apparently needed little persuasion from the Saudi ambassador in Washington , Prince Bandar bin Sultan , that the extended bin Laden family included no material witnesses . " <p> What ? How had I missed this story in the news ? I got up and went back through the New York Times , and there I found this headline : FEARING HARM , BIN LADEN KIN FLED FROM u.s . The story began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on New York and Washington , Saudi Arabia supervised the urgent evacuation of twenty-four members of Osama bin Laden 's extended family from the United States . " <p> So , with the approval of the FBI and the help of the Saudi government - and even though fifteen of the nineteen hijackers had been Saudi citizens - the relatives of the number-one suspect in the terror attacks were allowed not only to just up and leave the country , but they were assisted by our own authorities ! According to the Times of London , " the departure of so many Saudis worried U.S. investigators , who feared that some might have information about the hijackings . FBI agents insisted on checking passports , including the royal family 's . " <p> That 's all the FBI could do ? Check some passports , ask a few brief questions , like " Did you pack your own bags ? " and " Have your bags been in your possession since you packed them ? " Then , these potential material witnesses were sent off with a bon voyage and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorker , " When I asked a senior United States intelligence officer whether anyone had considered detaining members of the family , he replied , That 's called taking hostages . We do n't do that . ' " <p> Was he serious ? I was dumbstruck . Had I read this correctly ? Why was n't this being reported more widely ? Not that this is personal or anything , but I was stranded in Los Angeles on the morning of September nth . I scrambled to find a rental car , and then drove 3,000 miles to get back home - all because traveling by air was forbidden in the days following the attack . Yet private jets under the supervision of the Saudi government - and with Bush 's approval - were allowed to fly around the skies of America and pick up twenty-four members of the bin Laden family and take them to Europe , out of the reach of any U.S. officials . One FBI agent I spoke to told me that the bureau was " furious " that it was not allowed to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the kind police like to do when they are trying to track down a murderer . Usually , the police like to talk to the family members of the suspect to learn what they know , who they know , how they might help capture the fugitive . None of the normal procedures were followed . <p> This is mind-boggling . Here are two dozen bin Ladens on American soil , and all Bush can do is come up with some lame excuse that he 's worried about " their safety . " Might it have been possible that at least one of the twenty-four bin Ladens would have known something ? Or maybe just one of them could have been " convinced " to help track Osama down ? <p> Nope . None of that . So while thousands were stranded and could not fly , if you could prove you were a close relative of the biggest mass murderer in U.S. history , you got a free trip overseas ! <p> I STARTED WONDERING WHAT ELSE WAS going on that we were n't being told . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of all the questions that just did n't add up . Of course , I was never good at math , so to help me add it all up and analyze what it all meant , I figured I needed the help of , say , a graduate of the Harvard Business School . <p> So , George W. , how about giving me a hand ? Seeing how most of the questions involve you personally , you are probably the best individual to help me - and the nation sort through what I 've dug up . <p> My first question is : Is it true that the bin Ladens have had business relations with you and your family off and on for the past twenty-five years ? Back in 1977 , when your dad set you up with an oil company named Arbusto , you received financing from an old buddy of yours named James R. Bath . He had been hired by Salem bin Laden - Osama 's brother - to invest the bin Ladens ' money in various Texas ventures . Some $50,000 - or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After leaving office , your father became a consultant for the Carlyle Group , an investment firm with billions in defense holdings . The bin Laden family has invested a minimum of $2 million in the Carlyle Group . Frank Carlucci , secretary of defense under Reagan and now the head of Carlyle , also happens to sit on the board of directors of a think tank called the Middle East Policy Council along with a representative of the bin Laden family business . <p> After September 11nth , the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal both ran stories pointing out this strange coincidence . Your first response , Mr. Bush , was to ignore it , hoping , I guess , that the story would just go away . Your father and his buddies at Carlyle did not renounce the bin Laden investment . Your army of pundits said , We ca n't paint these bin Ladens with the same brush we use for Osama . They have disowned Osama ! They have nothing to do with him ! They hate and despise what he has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the video footage came out . It showed a number of those " good " bin Ladens - including Osama 's mother , a sister and two brothers - with Osama at his son 's wedding just eight months before September nth . The New Yorker reported that not only have the family members not cut ties to Osama , but they have continued to fund him as they have for years . It was no secret to the CIA that Osama bin Laden had access to his family fortune ( his share is estimated to be at least $30 million ) , and that the bin Ladens , as well as other Saudis , kept Osama and Al Qaeda well funded . <p> Mr. Bush , weeks went by after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon , yet your father and his friends at the Carlyle Group refused to buckle in their support for the bin Laden empire . Finally , nearly two months after the attacks , with more and more people questioning the propriety of the Bush family being in bed with the bin Ladens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the bin Ladens their millions back and asked them to leave the company as investors . Why did this take so long ? <p> To make matters worse , it turned out that one of bin Ladens brothers - Shafiq - was actually at a Carlyle Group business conference in Washington , D.C. the morning of September nth . The day before , at the same conference , your father and Shafiq had been chatting it up with all the other ex-government Carlyle bigwigs . <p> Mr. Bush , in case you do n't understand just how bizarre the media 's silence is regarding your family 's connections with bin Laden , let me draw an analogy to how the press or Congress might have handled something like this if the same shoe had been on the Clinton foot . If after the terrorist attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City , it was revealed that President Bill Clinton and his family had financial dealings with Timothy McVeigh 's family , what do you think your Republican Party and the media would have done with that one ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asked , like " What is that all about ? " Be honest , you know the answer . They would have skinned Clinton alive and thrown what was left of his carcass in Gitmo . <p> Or , to use the Clinton analogy again , imagine , in the hours after the Oklahoma City bombing , Bill Clinton suddenly started worrying about the " safety " of the McVeigh family up in Buffalo - and then arranged a free trip for them out of the country . What would you and the Republicans have said about that ? Suddenly , a stain on a blue dress probably would n't have been the top priority for a witch hunt , would it ? <p> MR . BUSH , THE BIN LADENS ARE NOT the only Saudis with whom you and your family have a close personal relationship . The entire royal family seems to be indebted to you - or is it the other way around ? <p> The number-one supplier of oil to the U.S. is the nation of Saudi Arabia , possessor of the largest known reserves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1990 , it was really the Saudis next door who felt threatened , and it was your father , George Bush I , who came to their rescue . The Saudis have never forgotten this , and , according to a March 2003 article in The New Yorker , some members of the royal family consider your family to be part of their extended family . Haifa , wife of Prince Bandar , the Saudi ambassador to the United States , says that your mother and father " are like my mother and father . I know if ever I needed anything I could go to them . " <p> As Robert Baer - who was a case officer in the CIA 's Directorate of Operations from 1976 to 1997 - revealed in his book Sleeping With the Devil , your dad even has a special name for the Saudi prince : He calls him " Bandar Bush . " Prince Bandar invests in the Carlyle Group , and he attended your mother 's seventy-fifth-birthday party . He donated $1 million to the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Barbara Bush 's literacy program . It has been a fruitful relationship all around . <p> When there was all that nasty stress surrounding the hanging chads in the Florida ballot boxes in the late fall of 2000 , your close friend Prince Bandar was there for your family , offering his support . He took your father on a pheasant-hunting trip to England , to help take his mind off all the chaos , while the royal family 's lawyer - your lawyer , James Baker - went to Florida to direct the battle for the ballots . ( Baker 's firm later represented Saudi royals in the lawsuits filed against them by the families of September nth victims . ) <p> To be fair , Mr. Bush , it 's not just your family members who are the recipients of the Saudis ' largesse . A major chunk of the American economy is built on Saudi money . They have a trillion dollars invested in our stock market and another trillion dollars sitting in our banks . If one day they chose to suddenly remove that money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailspin , causing an economic crisis the likes of which has never been seen . Couple that with the fact that the one and a half million barrels of oil we need daily from the Saudis also could vanish on a mere royal whim , and we begin to see how not only you but all of us are dependent on the House of Saud . <p> Maybe that 's why you 've blocked attempts to dig deeper into Saudi Arabia 's connections to the attacks of September nth . The headlines blared it the first day , and they blare it the same way now , two years later : TERRORISTS ATTACK UNITED STATES . Terrorists . I have wondered about this word for some time , so , George , let me ask you a question : If fifteen of the nineteen hijackers had been North Korean , and they killed 3,000 people , do you think the headline the next day might read , NORTH KOREA ATTACKS UNITED STATES ? Of Course it would . Or if it had been fifteen Iranians or fifteen Libyans or fifteen Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRAN ( or LIBYA or CUBA ) ATTACKS AMERICA ! Yet when it comes to September 11th , have you ever seen the headline , have you ever heard a newscaster , has one of your appointees ever uttered these words : " Saudi Arabia attacked the United States " ? <p> Of course you have n't . And so the question must be asked : Why not ? Why , when Congress releases its own investigation into September nth , do you , Mr. Bush , censor twenty-eight pages that deal with the Saudis ' role in the attack ? What is behind your apparent refusal to look at the one country that seems to be producing the " terrorists " that have killed our citizens ? Why are you so busy protecting the Saudis when you should be protecting us ? <p> Two nights after the attacks , according to a New Yorker article written by Elsa Walsh , you went out on the Truman Balcony of the White House to relax and smoke a cigar . It had been a horrific forty-eight hours , and you needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one close friend to join you . As he entered the White House , the two of you embraced , and then you took him out to the balcony , where he had a drink that you offered him . The two of you then lit up your cigars and stared out across the Ellipse toward the Washington Monument . You told him that if the United States could n't get any Al Qaeda operatives who may have been involved in the attack to cooperate , " we 'll hand them over to you . " It was an offer that I am sure he appreciated . After all , he was your good friend " Bandar Bush , " the prince from Saudi Arabia . As the smoke from the ashes still billowed through the air over Manhattan and Arlington , the smoke from the Saudi prince 's cigar wafted through the balmy night air of Washington , D.C. , with you , George W. Bush , by his side . rs <p> Excerpted from " Dude , Where 's My Country ? " by Michael Moore . c 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
