Psychologist Herbert Gravitz , Ph.D. , talks about the importance of families for the mentally ill . While the family may not cause mental illness , it may be one of the most powerful factors affecting the outcome . Photograph // When I lean back in my chair and think about the Parker family I know they have changed . Instead of fear , isolation and shame , there is love , connection and meaning . And most important , hope has replaced dread and despair . Millions of families throughout the country suffer just as the Packers did , but many are n't as fortunate . These families are ignored at best and blamed at worst by a society that does n't understand their needs . But the Parker family ( not their real name ) is an example of what can happen . Our first family meeting took place on a cool November afternoon four years ago in my Santa Barbara office . To my left sat Paul Parker , a young man unable to perform his duties as a bookkeeper . He had lost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-care behaviors had deteriorated as well , making it hard for him to live independently . He had become so increasingly bizarre that he was a concern and embarrassment to his entire family . To my right sat Paul 's parents , Tom and Tina . And next to them were their two younger children , 16-year-old Jim and 23-year-old Emma . Paul has a neurobiological disorder ( NBD ) and psychiatric illness caused by a brain dysfunction . NBDs currently include major depression , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder . Although different types of mental illnesses present different challenges , there are similarities in the way these illnesses impact family members and loved ones . The session unfolded . " You just do n't understand , doctor , " Paul 's father bursted out . " Nobody listens to us , his family . It 's not easy dealing with Paul . I hate to say this , but he can be such a burden . My wife and I ca n't do anything without considering its effect on Paul-and he is 30 years old . Half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul seems like a stranger to us . It 's as though aliens have taken our son and left an impostor . " Almost mindless of the children , Tom and Tina shared the devastation of Paul 's illness on their marriage . They were so drained and so angry with each other that they rarely made love , and they seldom went out together . When they did , they argued about Paul . Tom thought that many of Paul 's problems were exaggerated and that he was taking advantage of them . Like many mothers , Tina was more protective and accommodating of her son , especially during the early years . These differences led to quarrels in front of the children , which the family dreaded almost as much as Paul 's strange and peculiar behavior . Both parents had little compassion left for Paul or each other . Even less time was left for Jim and Emma , because they seemed so normal and caused no problems . Without warning Jim interrupted , " Not again . Why does Paul get all the attention ? I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoring her own fears , Emma tried to reassure the family that Paul would be okay . " We 've handled Paul 's problems before , " she pleaded . There were many unspoken feelings , such as the overwhelming responsibility Tom and Tina suffered , the resentment that Emma and Jim felt , as well as the family 's guilt , exhaustion and demoralization . And there was a half-wish that Paul would just disappear . Despite everything , the family loved Paul . They each had powerful  --  even fierce-loyalties toward him . This was evident when Tom explained : " We brought Paul here , we care what happens , we sit in the waiting room while his life is on the line , and we will take care of Paul when everything is said and done . " Paul was important to all of them . Stopping the hurt The family had sought help from other mental health professionals . Paul 's parents recounted being blamed for his disorder by several professionals , and they reported feeling confused and helpless . Emma and Jim felt like outcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friends . Everyone wanted the hurt to stop . At the very least , the family wanted someone to recognize their pain and say , " This must be very hard for all of you . " The Parkers are not rare or unusual . One in five Americans has a psychiatric disorder at any given time , and half will have one at some point in their lifetime . More than 100 million Americans have a close family member who suf72 fers from a major mental illness . Of the 10 leading causes of disability , half are psychiatric . By the year 2020 , the major cause of disability in the world may be major depression . Further , it has been estimated that only 10 to 20% of those requiring care in the United States receive it in institutions ; the rest receive their primary care from the family . Devoted to their ill member , the family may be the best-kept secret in the arsenal of healing . Yet , family members are considered the support team ; they are not known as the stressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sons , husbands and wives deserve attention as well . Mental illness can weave a web of doubt , confusion and chaos around the family Unwittingly , the person with mental illness can dominate the entire family through control and fear or helplessness and incapacity . Like a bully , the mental illness bosses the primary sufferer as well as the loved ones . Instability , separation , divorce and abandonment are frequent family outcomes of mental illness . Under the influence I have observed five factors that bind families to the despair of their loved one 's illness : stress , trauma , loss , grief and exhaustion . These factors provide a useful framework to understand the underlying structure of the family under the influence . * Stress is at the foundation of the family experience of mental illness . There is constant tension , dread and worry because the illness can strike at any time . It 's common for family members " to walk on eggshells . " The Parkers liken the atmosphere to a pressure cooker and the possibility of the ill loved one " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leads to psychosomatic illness . Tom has high blood pressure , while Tina suffers ulcers. * Trauma also lies at the core of the family 's experience . It can erode members ' beliefs about control , safety , meaning and their own value . While victims of NBDs rarely assault others physically , they do assault with words , and their words can pull apart the family . Another form of trauma is " witness trauma , " where the family watches helplessly as loved ones are tortured by their symptoms . This type of family atmosphere can often induce the development of traumatic symptoms like invasive thoughts , distancing and physical disorders . The result can be traumatic stress or posttraumatic stress disorder . Much of the family 's despair results from trying to manage and control what it can not . Knowing when to intervene is one of most difficult lessons a family must learn . * Loss lies at the very nature of family life . Family members report losses in their personal , social , spiritual and economic lives , They suffer losses in privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we miss most is a normal life , " said Mrs. Parker . " We have lost being just an ordinary family . " The family may be the only place where we can not be replaced . So it can be devastating if we can not have effective family relationships . * Grief occurs from this steady diet of loss . Family members can go through protracted grieving , which often goes undiagnosed or untreated . Grieving centers around what life will not be . " It 's as if we are in a funeral that never ends , " said Tom . Grieving can become compounded because our culture does not sufficiently acknowledge and legitimize the grief of those under the influence of mental illness . A lack of appropriate entitlement can follow . " I really have no right to feel bad . Paul is the one who is ill , " said Tom . Therefore , mourning fails to occur , preventing acceptance and integration of loss . Photograph // * Exhaustion is the natural result of living in such an atmosphere . The family becomes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concerns , issues and problems of the ill loved one . Worry , preoccupation , anxiety and depression can leave the family drained-emotionally , physically , spiritually , economically . Tina summarized it , " There 's no rest . " Tom added , " We ca n't even get a good night 's sleep ; we lie awake wondering what Paul is doing . This is 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . " Leaving it to fate Living in an environment of chronic stress , trauma , loss , grief and fatigue can also lead other family members to their own parallel disorder . Parallel disorders of family members are also known as secondary or vicarious traumatization . The family members can develop symptoms including denial , minimization , enabling , high tolerance for inappropriate behavior , confusion and doubt , guilt and depression , and other physical and emotional problems . Other more recent terms include learned helplessness , which occurs when family members find that their actions are futile ; depression fallout , the consequence of living in close proximity to a loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from intimate relationships when family members believe they can not help their loved one and are unable to disengage from the illness long enough to get restored . " I 'm just too tired to care , " said Tina . The symptoms of families under the influence of NBDs can be devastating , but they are also very treatable . Research consistently shows that four elements lead to healing : information , coping skills , support and love . Healing begins with an accurate diagnosis ; from there core issues can be confronted . The family moves beyond their loved one 's illness-not away from their loved one . In response to pain , the family can learn to develop a disciplined approach to dealing with their situations . Tina , for example , has embraced spirituality and has learned to ask herself , " What is the lesson that I am supposed to learn in this very moment ? " Tom adds , " When I gave up caring about what was supposed to be , I got back my footing and now have something to offer Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , the Parkers made five key transitions that facilitated healing . Although not every family member made all of these shifts , most family members made enough of them to change their lives . First , to transform the way they thought and felt , they shifted from denial to awareness . When the reality of the illness was confronted and accepted , healing began . The second transition was a shift in focus from the mentally ill person to attention to self This shift requires the establishment of healthy boundaries . The third transition was moving from isolation to support . Facing the problems of living with mental illness is too difficult to do alone . Family members worked within a framework of love . This makes it easier to relate to the illness with distance and perspective . The fourth change is family members learning to respond to the person instead of the illness itself . The fifth and final shift toward healing occurs when members find personal meaning in their situation . This elevates the personal , private and limited stories of the family to a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change what happened or even take the hurt away , it just makes people feel less alone and more empowered . It creates choices and new possibilities . It has been a little over three years since my first encounter with the Parker family . Yesterday , I met with them for the first time in over a year . As they sat in their familiar seats , I reminisced . I remembered the moment the family 's denial was broken : when Tina said to her son Paul , " I have your pain and I have my pain-I have both . " When we first met , they were trying to save a past ; now they are building a future . The session was punctuated by laughter as the Parkers learned to reduce their expectations to more realistic levels . They also learned to take better care of themselves . Because family members who get help and support demonstrate healthier functioning , Paul has become more responsible for his own recovery . Change has occurred for many other reasons . Newer medications , for example , have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the brain has occurred in the last 10 years . Initially , family members could n't talk to one another . Now , they turn to each other and speak openly about their concerns . Tom and Tina have found a new life through their advocacy and support group work . Emma has married . And Jim is studying to be a psychologist and wants to help families . Healing a family entails discipline . With love and commitment , family members can break the spell of the illness by broadening their sense of meaning . And meaning can be found in such diverse areas as religion , raising children , contributing to charities , forming organizations , developing a 12-step program , writing , running for office , or helping the boy next door who lost his father . Families like the Parker 's are among a growing number of people who are recognizing that they have been impacted by the mental illness of a loved one . They are choosing to acknowledge their plight , grieve their losses , learn new skills and connect with others .

It can be a terrifying , heart-breaking , lonely and exhausting experience or it can forge the latent , untapped strengths of individuals and families . There is more hope than ever for families . And it is never too late to have a happy family Said Tina Parker , " While I do n't believe life is a bowl of cherries , it is n't a can of worms anymore either . " And Tom adds , " Hardly a day goes by where I am not grateful for my family and being alive . I savor the good days and let the bad ones pass . I have learned to make the most out of every moment .
