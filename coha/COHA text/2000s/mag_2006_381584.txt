How important is your racial identity to you ? Researchers long thought it was n't that crucial to whites . But a groundbreaking new study on whiteness and race relations by University of Minnesota sociologists shows that whites in the U.S. are far more conscious of being white  --  and the privileges it brings  --  than was believed . <P> The survey is packed with fascinating findings , some surprising ( a stunning proportion of whites  --  77%  --  say their race has a distinct culture that should be preserved ) and some less so ( whites view their role in the social hierarchy more benignly than blacks and Hispanics do ) . Whites are more likely to say prejudice and discrimination put blacks at a disadvantage than to say those factors contribute to white advantage . And they are much less likely than nonwhites to attribute inequality to bias in the legal system . <P> What to make of all this ? Though whites in the U.S. believe there remain advantages to being white , they do n't necessarily link those advantages with blacks ' disadvantages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whites have invented subtle ways to convince themselves that race is n't a problem in America . " Blacks do see more racism in society than whites but , contrary to stereotype , seem disinclined to blame the system for their disadvantage . In fact , they are more likely to attribute it to individual causes like a lack of hard work  --  77% did so , compared with 62% of whites . " We think of U.S. minorities as less engaged in American individualism , " Hartmann says , " but they are maybe more so . "
