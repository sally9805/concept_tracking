A controversial new book has sparked a backlash , prompt-ing a store in Minneapolis , Minn. , to abruptly rescind a speaking invitation to the author . Is it a racy Henry Miller  --  style novel ? A political screed ? A Howard Stern tell-all ? No , the Rrated tome arousing concerns about obscene language and public decency is , of all things , a cookbook . <P> But Anthony Bourdain 's Les Halles Cookbook is not your average cooking manual . Bourdain , never one to hold back , once referred to vegetarians as " the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit . " The book is written in the same brusque style , and its language can get a little profane . The introduction to poulet rti gently proclaims , " If you ca n't properly roast a damn chicken then you 're one helpless , hopeless , sorry-ass bivalve in an apron . " Pearl onions are " little fers . " And butter should be formed into a log " like you would roll a joint " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But if you can get past all the cussing , this cookbook could be your new best friend in the kitchen . Bourdain 's passion for food is contagious , and his precise instructions go a long way toward helping make classic bistro cooking , from frise aux lardons to boeuf bourguignon , less intimidating for the home cook . Do n't worry  --  the book comes in a brown paper wrapper.  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
