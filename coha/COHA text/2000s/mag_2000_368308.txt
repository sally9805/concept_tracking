Does each generation of kids get the music it deserves ? No , but it gets the music that defines it . It 's in the generational blood . Every joy or pang of growing up has an accompanying sound track . And decades later , car-radio playings of specific songs , good or bad , can be as acute a prod to sweet or rueful memory as Proust 's tea cake . For Cameron Crowe , the pastry was named Led Zeppelin , the Allman Brothers , Poco . And Crowe did n't just listen to them . He interviewed them . <P> The ' 70s were when the machinery of rock-starmaking was perfected . The poet-satyrs onstage and the poet-flacks of the rock press fed off one another voraciously . The artists preened ; the authors postured  --  all to make the cover of Rolling Stone . <P> What gives Crowe 's story poignance is his background as a teenage working journalist . At the age when kids are supposed to be feeling those gonadal guitar jolts for the first time , he was standing backstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual confessions from rock Rimbauds . This was a kid 's dream . But to live it  --  to survive it  --  Crowe had to be a premature grownup . <P> Almost Famous has a lot of smart lines , but the best are in Patrick Fugit 's face . Fugit , who plays the teen Crowe character , William Miller , has a baby face , creased with dimples and given to grins , but it is stuck on a tall , gawky body . Then he speaks , and he sounds so much older than he looks it 's as if his voice had been dubbed by the adult he would become  --  the adult who became Crowe . Watchful and open , skeptical but not cynical , Fugit manages to embody both the child and the man , the boy who went on the trip and the writer who would remember it and shape it into comic drama . <P> William lucks into his on-the-road adventure with the rock quartet Stillwater , and is adopted as their chronicler and mascot . At 15 he could be the poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his mother could be right when she blurts out , " Rock stars have kidnapped my son . " But William and the film are too savvy for that . People use one another here , but genially , and in small doses . On this cross-country trek , everyone is , benignly , lost in poppyland . It 's Oz without the wizard . <P> The typical boy-to-man fable is one of groping in the dark , a child beset by demons , on a road with no signposts . But William is n't clueless ; he has too many clues . He is swamped in advice : from his musical mentor , the rebel critic Lester Bangs ( another off-kilter , on-target tour de force by Philip Seymour Hoffman ) ; from his muse , the knowing groupie Penny Lane ( Kate Hudson , with the soft , curly haired charisma of a Woodstock Botticelli ) ; from Stillwater 's lead guitarist , Russell Hammond ( Billy Crudup , who has finally found the movie role to fit his questing intelligence and almost-too-hunky features ) ; and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William 's task is to sift all this good , or at least plausible , advice and make his own choices . On the fly , on the road , he 's forced into maturity . <P> Most memory movies ( and novels and plays ) have a score to settle . When parents are depicted as idiots , teachers as tyrants and classmates as sadists , you can bet the writer feels so much better for taking revenge on the people who made his teen years miserable .
