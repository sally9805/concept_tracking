/Jan 2007 MAKE THE MOST OF TODAY 'S STATE-OF-THE-ART DIGITAL PREDATOR CALLS . TACTICS &; GEAR Early last winter I was walking along a creek and jump-shooting ducks when a coyote ran past me , carrying the spine of a fawn deer in its mouth . Well , if the coyotes were n't going to play fair , then neither was I. A couple of weeks later , at morning light , I slipped into the same area , set up my electronic caller and sat back to watch and wait . After 10 minutes of wailing rabbit racket , coyote ears appeared along a low ridge . The coyote looped downwind and came straight for the caller . A shot from my .25/06 ended its fawn-killing days . That was a short and sweet hunt . But there is much more to correctly working an electronic caller than just cranking up the volume . Work the terrain Gary Roberson , owner of Burnham Brothers Game Calls , says a remote-controlled electronic caller allows a hunter to direct a predator to an exact spot for a sure shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Roberson says , " so I always want to place the caller upwind of where I 'm going to sit . " If a ravine is downwind , a coyote is sure to follow it for cover when he 's coming in . Placing the caller on the far side of the ravine will pull the coyote into the open and position you for a clear shot . Al Morris , of Hunter 's Specialties , says he lets the terrain dictate where he sets up . " In a lot of places , like the hardwood thickets in the East , you do n't have any choice but to set up with the call downwind , " he says . " If that 's the case , I put the caller where I can hopefully see the coyote coming and shoot before it catches my scent . " Mike Dillon , of FoxPro , hunts predators across the country . He has found that coyotes in Texas and across the West are more used to open country . But at home in Pennsylvania , he rarely sees a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of fields , " he says . " So I put my caller in the field a ways or on the edge and then sit back in the trees . Often that 's upwind of the call , but there 's no other choice . " Dillon feels that the chance a coyote will smell him is more than off-set by the good light that enables him to see a coyote coming . " From back in the woods it 's sort of like looking out of a dark building , " Dillon says . Shift the focus A remote control is the biggest advantage an electronic caller provides . Roberson says that when using a hand call , he killed half the coyotes and bobcats he lured in and saw , but his success rate went up to about 70 percent when he started using calls with a remote . The coyotes ' attention was concentrated on the call and away from Roberson  --  the only movement he had to make was to push a button on the remote . All the experts prefer to place their calls fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never more than 100 yards . " If a bobcat 's coming in and sticks to cover like they do , you may never get a clear shot if the caller is sitting a hundred yards out , " Roberson says . Pick the right call The variety of calls and sounds available at your fingertips is what makes electronic callers so devious . Morris says he selects which to use based on the prey animals in the area . " When there are lots of cottontails in the area , I go with a distressed cottontail , " he says . " When there are lots of deer , I go with a fawn in distress . " Those calls work especially well in the fall to early winter , when predators are primarily thinking about their stomachs . The coyote breeding season is from mid-January until March , and howls work well to locate the dogs . The whines of a pup in distress play on maternal instincts during spring denning . Mix up your sounds Bobcats are well-known for stopping short of a call , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . However , you can pique their interest by adding a sound , such as the rustle of leaves or the shrill racket of a woodpecker , to the squeals of a rabbit in distress , or by switching to another call , perhaps from a cottontail to a jack-rabbit . Turning up the volume is another option you might try to bring them in closer . Dillon presets several sounds on his FoxPro caller so all he has to do is push a button when he wants to change sounds quickly . When a bobcat hangs up , Dillon might go to the squeaks of a rodent in distress . If he shoots one coyote and a second one starts to run off , he switches to a canine-in-distress call . That often stops a female coyote long enough for him to get off a shot . Some sound cards for Hunter 's Specialties calls come with preset combinations . " A cottontail with a canine pup in distress  --  that really gets into a coyote 's head , " Morris says . Hang a lure A predator approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears . Roberson suspends a turkey feather with a piece of fishing line next to his call . The feather turning with the breeze is enough motion to keep a predator 's eyes directed on the call and away from the hunter so that he can move enough to bring his gun to bear . Add sounds Several electronic callers come loaded with up to 200 calls and sounds right out of the box . And there are many options available in case you want to add even more sounds to entice predators into easy gun range . Additional sounds can be downloaded from FoxPro 's Web site ( gofoxpro.com ) . They can be stored either in a FoxPro caller or on flash cards for use in other calls . Other callers , such as the Phantom Predator Wireless and Compucaller II , require separate sound chips for their calls , ranging from owl hoots to a rat in distress .

The twin-masted courier ship flying that wind-starched banner as she scudded along on the brisk breeze was little more than seventy feet long , built for speed rather than endurance . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was small for any galley , even one as diminutive as she was , but her slender , lightly constructed hull was well suited for rowing , and her lateen sails drove her in a rapid flurry of foam as she went slicing across the brilliant sun-splintered water and foaming white horses of the thirty-mile-wide passage between Callie 's Island and the northeastern shore of Eraystor Bay . <br> Father Rahss Sawal , the small fleet vessel 's commander , stood on his tiny quarterdeck , hands clasped behind him , and concentrated on looking confident while he gazed up at the seabirds and wyverns hovering against the painfully blue sky . It was harder than it ought to have been to maintain the outward assurance ( it would never have done to call it arrogance ) proper to the master of one of Mother Church 's couriers , and Sawal did n't much care for the reason he found it so . <br> The Temple 's messengers , whether landbound or afloat , enjoyed absolute priority and freedom of passage . They carried God 's own messages and commands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mortal had the temerity to challenge their passage wherever God or His Church might send them . That had been true literally since the Creation , and no one had ever dared to dispute it . Unfortunately , Sawal was no longer certain the centuries-old inviolability of Mother Church 's messengers continued to hold true . <br> The thought was . . . disturbing , in more ways than one . Most immediately , because of the potential consequences for his own current mission . In the long run , because the failure of that inviolability was unthinkable . Defiance of the authority of God 's Church could have only one consequence for the souls of the defiers , and if their example led others into the same sin . . . <br> Sawal pushed that thought aside once more , telling himself  --  insisting to himself  --  that whatever madness had infected the Kingdom of Charis , God would never permit it to spread beyond Charis ' borders . The universal authority of Mother Church was the linchpin not simply of the world in which he lived , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that authority were challenged , if it failed , the consequences would be unthinkable . Shanwei , lost and damned mother of evil , must be licking her fangs at the very possibility in the dark , dank corner of Hell to which the Archangel Langhorne had consigned her for her sins . Even now she must be testing the bars , trying the strength of her chains , as she tasted the overweening , sinful pride of those who sought to set their own fallible judgment in place of God 's . Langhorne himself had locked that gate behind her , with all the authority of eternity , but Man had free will . Even now , he could turn the key in that lock if he so chose , and if he did . . . <br> Damn those Charisians , he thought grimly . Do n't they even realize what door they 're opening ? Do n't they care ? Do n't  --  <br> His jaw tightened and he forced himself to relax his shoulders and draw a deep , cleansing breath . It did n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been abundantly clear . Sawal was to deliver the bishop executor 's dispatches to Bishop Executor Wyllys in Eraystor at all costs . That phrase  --  " at all costs "  --  had never before been part of Sawal 's orders . There 'd never been any need for it , but there was now , and  --  <br> " Deck there ! " The shout came down from the crow 's nest . " Deck there ! Three sail on the port bow ! " " Well , well , " Commander Paitryk Hywyt , Royal Charisian Navy , murmured to himself as he peered through the spyglass . " This should be interesting . " <br> He lowered the glass and frowned thoughtfully . His orders were perfectly clear on this point . They 'd made him more than a little nervous when he first received them , but they were definitely clear , and now he discovered that he was actually looking forward to obeying them . Odd . He would n't have thought that was likely to happen . <br> " It 's a Church courier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Zhak Urvyn , HMS Wave 's first lieutenant , made a distinctly unhappy sound . <br> " Some of the men may not like it , Sir , " Urvyn said softly . Hywyt glanced sideways at him , then shrugged . <br> " I 've got a feeling the men 's attitude may just surprise you a bit , Zhak , " he said dryly . " They 're still about as pissed off as I 've ever seen them , and they know who that courier 's really working for this morning . " <br> Urvyn nodded , but he looked gloomier than ever , and Hywyt grimaced mentally . It was n't the men Urvyn expected to be unhappy ; it was Urvyn himself . <br> " Bring her three points to port , if you please , Lieutenant , " Hywyt said , speaking rather more formally than was his wont . " Let 's lay out a course to intercept her . " <br> " Aye , aye , Sir . " Urvyn 's expression was worried , but he saluted and passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden decks to tend sheets and braces . <br> Wave changed course , slicing across the water close-hauled on the port tack , and Hywyt felt a familiar surge of pleasure as his vessel responded . The sleek , flush-decked , twin-masted schooner was just over ninety-five feet long on the waterline , and mounted fourteen thirty-pounder carronades . Unlike some of her sisters , Wave had been designed and built from the keel up as a light cruiser for the Royal Charisian Navy . Her revolutionary sail plan made her faster and far more weatherly than any other ship Hywyt had ever encountered , far less commanded , and she 'd already taken no less than seven prizes  --  almost half of those captured by the entire blockading squadron  --  here in Emeraldian waters since the Battle of Darcos Sound . That was what speed and handiness meant , and the comfortable sound prize money made falling into their purses had helped overcome any lingering qualms his crew might have cherished . They were Charisians , after all , he thought with a gleam of humor . Charis ' numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kingdom of shopkeepers and moneylenders , " and not in tones of approval . Hywyt had listened to their rancorous envy for years , and he had to admit there was at least a little truth to the stereotype of the Charisian constantly on the prowl for ways to make a quick mark . <br> Of course , we 're also very good at it , are n't we ? he reflected , and felt himself smiling as the courier boat with the dark green flag drew rapidly nearer . <br> He could n't be positive the other ship had come from Corisande , but no other explanation seemed very likely . The dispatch boat had obviously approached through Dolphin Reach , which certainly meant it had also crossed the Sea of Zebediah . No courier from Haven or Howard would have been coming from that direction , and Hywyt rather doubted Sharleyan of Chisholm was particularly interested in corresponding with Nahrmahn of Emerald at the moment . And judging from the way the fellow had chosen the strait between Callie 's Island and the Emeraldian coast , he definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squadron . <br> Unfortunately for him , he already had , and it was evident that his ship , for all its sleek design , was quite a bit slower than Wave under these conditions . <br> " Clear for action , " he said , and watched the gap between the two ships narrow as the drum began to beat . Rahss Sawal tried very hard not to swear as the Charisian schooner swept towards him . Obviously , his information was even more out-of-date than he 'd feared when Bishop Executor Thomys gave him his orders . He had n't expected to see Charisian warships actually inside Eraystor Bay proper . Then again , he had n't expected to see the gold kraken on black of the Charisian flag flying above what used to be the Emeraldian fortress on Callie 's Island , either . <br> The dispersal of the Charisian warships was the clearest possible evidence of the totality of their victory at the Battle of Darcos Sound . The true extent of the allied fleet 's defeat had still been unclear when Sawal left Manchyr . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corisande had clung to the hope that the majority of the ships which had not returned had found refuge in Emerald , where they were even then helping Nahrmahn defend their anchorage . <br> Obviously not , Sawal thought sourly . <br> He could see exactly four ships now , counting the schooner charging down on his own command , and every one of them flew Charisian colors . They were spread out widely , as well , to cover as much of the bay as they could , and they would n't have been doing that if there 'd been any possibility at all that someone might consider attacking them . That , coupled with the fact that all the island fortifications Sawal could see from his quarterdeck had clearly become Charisian bases , not Emeraldian ones , made it abundantly clear that there was no " allied fleet " any longer , much less one that was still defending its anchorage . <br> Sawal had never before encountered one of the Charisians ' new schooners , and he was astonished at how close to the wind the thing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail plan . His ship had the same number of masts , but the Charisian had to have at least twice the sail area . It also had the stability and size to carry more sail , and it was driving far harder under these conditions than his own ship could manage . <br> The number of gun ports arranged along its side was at least equally impressive , and he felt his stomach muscles tighten as the stubby muzzles of cannon poked out of them . <br> " Father ? " <br> He glanced at his own second-in-command . The one-word question made the other priest 's tension abundantly clear , and Sawal could n't blame him . Not that he had an answer for what he knew the man was actually asking . <br> " We 'll have to see what we see , Brother Tymythy , " he said instead . " Hold your course . " " He 's not changing course , " Urvyn said . <br> As redundant statements of the obvious went , that one took some beating , Hywyt thought . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with massive restraint as the range fell steadily . It was down to less than three hundred yards and still dropping , and he wondered how far the other skipper was going to go in calling what he undoubtedly hoped was Wave 's bluff . " Pass the word to the Gunner to stand ready to fire a shot across his bow . " <br> Urvyn hesitated . It was a tiny thing . Someone else might not have noticed it at all , but Urvyn had been Hywyt 's first lieutenant for over six months . For a moment , Hywyt thought he would have to repeat the order , but then Urvyn turned heavily away and raised his leather speaking trumpet . <br> " Stand ready to fire across his bow , Master Charlz ! " he shouted , and Wave 's gunner waved back in acknowledgment . " I think he 's  --  " <br> Brother Tymythy never completed that particular observation . There was no need . The flat , concussive thud of a single gun punctuated it quite nicely , and Sawal watched the cannonball go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across their crests as cleanly as any kraken 's dorsal fin . <br> " He 's fired on us ! " Tymythy said instead . His voice was shrill with outrage , and his eyes were wide , as if he was actually surprised that even Charisians should dare to offer such insult to Mother Church . And perhaps he was . Sawal , on the other hand , discovered that he truly was n't . <br> " Yes , he has , " the under-priest agreed far more calmly than he felt . <br> I did n't really believe they 'd do it , he thought . I 'm sure I did n't . So why am I not surprised that they have ? This is the beginning of the end of the world , for God 's sake ! <br> He thought again about the dispatches he carried , who they were addressed to , and why . He thought about the whispered rumors , about exactly what Prince Hektor and his allies had hoped for . . . what rewards they 'd been promised by the Church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . By the Knights of the Temple Lands . There is a difference ! <br> Yet even as he insisted upon that to himself , he knew better . Whatever technical or legal distinctions might exist , he knew better . And that , he realized now , with something very like despair , was why he truly was n't surprised . <br> Even now , he could n't put it into words for himself , could n't make himself face it that squarely , but he knew . Whatever might have been true before the massive onslaught Prince Hektor and his allies had launched upon the Kingdom of Charis , the Charisians knew as well as Sawal who had truly been behind it . They knew the reality of the cynical calculations , the casual readiness to destroy an entire realm in blood and fire , and the arrogance which had infused and inspired them . This time the " Group of Four " had come too far out of the shadows , and what they had envisioned as the simple little assassination of an inconvenient kingdom had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true enemy had been all along , and that explained exactly why that schooner was prepared to fire on the flag of God 's own Church . <br> The schooner was closer now , leaning to the press of her towering spread of canvas , her bow garlanded with white water and flying spray that flashed like rainbow gems under the brilliant sun . He could make out individuals along her low bulwarks , pick out her uniformed captain standing aft , near the wheel , see the crew of the forward gun in her starboard broadside reloading their weapon . He looked up at his own sails , then at the schooner 's krakenlike grace , and drew a deep breath . <br> " Strike our colors , Brother Tymythy , " he said . <br> " Father ? " Brother Tymythy stared at him , as if he could n't believe his own ears . <br> " Strike our colors ! " Sawal repeated more firmly . <br> " But , but the Bishop Executor  --  " <br> " Strike our colors ! " Sawal snapped . <br> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew their orders as well as Sawal did , after all . But it was far easier for a bishop to order an under-priest to maintain the authority of Mother Church " at any cost " than it was for Father Rahss Sawal to get the crew of his vessel killed as part of an exercise in futility . <br> If there were any hope of actually delivering our dispatches , I would n't strike , he told himself , and wondered whether or not it was the truth . But it 's obvious we ca n't keep away from them , and if those people over there are as prepared to fire into us as I think they are , they 'll turn this entire vessel into toothpicks with a single broadside . Two , at the outside . There 's no point in seeing my own people slaughtered for nothing , and we are n't even armed . <br> The flag which had never before been dipped to any mortal power fluttered down from the courier boat 's masthead . Sawal watched it come down , and an ice-cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a small thing , in so many ways , that scrap of embroidered fabric . But that was how all true catastrophes began , was n't it ? With small things , like the first stones in an avalanche . <br> Maybe I should have made them fire into us . At least then there would n't have been any question , any ambiguity . And if Charis is prepared to defy Mother Church openly , perhaps a few dead crewmen would have made that point even more clearly . <br> Perhaps they would have , and perhaps he should have forced the Charisians to do it , but he was a priest , not a soldier , and he simply could n't . And , he told himself , the mere fact that Charis had fired upon the flag of Holy Mother Church should be more than enough without his allowing his people to be killed , on top of it . <br> No doubt it would , and yet even as he told himself that , he knew . <br> The lives he might have saved this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane 's breath beside the horrendous mountains of death looming just over the lip of tomorrow . <br> Excerpted from BY SCHISM RENT ASUNDER by David Weber . <br> Copyright 2008 by David Weber . <br> Published in July 2008 by Tom Doherty Associates ,
