This week 's platinum picks <p> The French Connection <p> ***1/2 out of four , 1971 , Fox , rated R , Blu-ray , $35 <p> Tinkering with film history is a slippery slope , and I 'm surprised that I like director William Friedkin 's makeover of his Oscar-winning masterpiece 's color palette . But take heed : Its cinematographer Owen Roizman is already on record as being " appalled . " <p> Back story : OK , history would be better served by including both versions . But DeLuxe Color negatives had myriad problems with skin tones , and Friedkin thinks everyone in the standard version of this unusually grubby cop movie looks as if they 've been in the sun too long . On balance , a most impressive Blu-ray package . <p> Extras , extras : 2001 's " Five Star Collection " DVD had wall-to-wall bonuses ; the Blu-ray retains most . Additions include a gem about jazzman Don Ellis score ( avant-garde for ' 71 ) and Friedkin 's demonstration of the color tweaks . <p> The Exterminating Angel <p> **** , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrated , $40 <p> Like Criterion 's also-new 45-minute Simon of the Desert ( 1965 , unrated , $25 ) , a romp even by the standards of rascalish surrealist Luis Buouel . <p> Back story : In a warm-up for 1972 's worldwide triumph The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie , Buouel comically dumps on the upper classes , specifically dinner-party snobs who are supernaturally unable to exit their host 's mansion . A blast . <p> Extras , extras : Beyond essays/interviews , a wonderful 2008 documentary , The Last Script : Remembering Luis Buouel , in which son Juan Luis and dad 's longtime writing collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere visit the cinematic titan 's old haunts : Madrid , Paris , New York , L.A. , Mexico , more Paris . With stories of formative pals Federico Garcia Lorca , Salvador Dali  --  and actor Fernando Rey ( The French Connection 's villain ) . <p> Changeling <p> *** , 2008 , Universal , R , $30 ; Blu-ray , $40 <p> Engrossing for 140 minutes , no minor feat . But director Clint Eastwood 's rendering of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It was 1928 municipal corruption gone wild : An L.A. suburb 's police force tried forcing the single mom ( Angelina Jolie ) of a missing son to accept a youngster they returned as the real deal when she knew it was n't . Critics split on the movie , and naysayers blamed a rambling script . This also is one chilly Jolie performance , Oscar nomination or not . But certain supporting work is solid ( John Malkovich included ) , and James J. Murakami 's Oscar-nominated art direction is beyond impressive . <p> Extras , extras : Clint and Angie love each other up , but juicier stuff deals with production design and costuming . <p> Also in stores <p> Body of Lies <p> ** , 2008 , Warner , R , $29 ; Blu-ray , $36 <p> Any director who can sandwich the execrable Hannibal between Oscar-winning Gladiator and notably better Black Hawk Down is , well ... erratic . But speaking as one who actually likes 2006 's A Good Year ( a movie that calls oblivion home ) , I 'm bummed by Ridley Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ignites despite Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe . The script by The Departed 's William Monahan pares the story down to agency basics , jettisoning material that made the book a fluid flow while changing the nationality of Jordan-based junior spook DiCaprio 's romantic interest ( for a not-very-credible relationship ) . What 's left are explosions and bandying between DiCaprio and his Langley , Va. , superior ( Crowe ) as they infiltrate terrorists via high-tech spyware . Crowe , who packed on pounds for his role , suggests months of lard Smoothies here , Cinderella Man 's frame gone pumpkin . <p> The Helen Morgan Story <p> **1/2 , 1957 Warner , unrated , $20 <p> Gogi Grant keenly dubbed lead Ann Blyth 's vocals for this boozy bio of Morgan the Prohibition-era chanteuse whose notable movies were 1929 's talkie ground-breaker Applause ( on DVD ) and the 1936 Show Boat ( amazingly , not on DVD ) . But the selling point is Paul Newman in just his fourth movie , playing a woman-slapping bootlegger . Morgan is directed by Casablanca 's Michael Curtiz late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm for Elvis 's pre-Army farewell in King Creole . Ill-scripted , this does look great in CinemaScope , and it 's amusing to see aging jazz-agers Rudy Vallee , Walter Winchell and songwriter Jimmy McHugh ( On the Sunny Side of the Street ) playing themselves as much younger men . <p> More highlights <p> *Ironweed ( *** for movie ; * for presentation ; 1987 , Lionsgate , R , $15 ) : William Kennedy 's Depression-based novel about Albany hobo-ism won a Pulitzer , and Hector Babenco 's honorable near-miss movie version ( with great moments ) got Oscar nominations for Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep . TriStar released the movie in theaters , so you 'd think Sony , a company that respects film history , would have the DVD rights . Instead , controlling Lionsgate has basically recycled the old Vestron VHS . Who does n't remaster and letterbox an ' 80s movie in this day and age ? Incredible . <p> *Soul Men ( **1/2 ; 2008 , Sony , R , Weinstein/Genius , $29 ; Blu-ray , $35 ) : November 's big-screen dual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it 's hardly the extra-base hit you 'd hope the final film of both Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes would be . The former plays a once semi-famous musician re-teamed with his estranged partner ( Samuel L. Jackson ) for a memorial concert at Harlem 's Apollo Theater . The real Bernie reflects on his career for some sweet end credits . A sadder coda is the lawsuit that Sam Moore ( of Sam &amp; Dave ) filed against the movie earlier this month . <p> *Nights in Rodanthe ( ** , 2008 , Warner , PG-13 , $29 ; Blu-ray , $36 ) : Mother Nature does a number on some lovely North Carolina beach property , and the script does something similar to Richard Gere and Diane Lane ( together again after The Cotton Club and Unfaithful ) . As Lane 's pal , Viola Davis gets to be cheerier than she was in Doubt . But this smoochy treacle would benefit from a Ray Harryhausen creature tromping out of the Atlantic . <p> Top rented movies <p> 1 . Body of Lies <p> 2 . Changeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 .
