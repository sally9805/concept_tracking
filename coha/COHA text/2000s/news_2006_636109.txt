<p> Random thoughts while wondering whether White Sox pitchers  --  starting and otherwise  --  are going to come close to last season 's success : <p> - For some inexplicable reason , there seems to be an inverse relationship between a Cubs prospect 's hype and level of success ( English translation : Major expectations bring minor achievement and vice versa ) . The latest example being Carlos Marmol , who Sunday shut down the Cincinnati Reds in his big-league starting debut . Following in the reasonably unheralded Sean Marshall 's footsteps . As opposed to Rich Hill and Angel Guzman , who were touted before being routed . <p> - For Cubs fans wanting to look to next year ( and it 's never too early for that , is it ? ) , envision a rotation of Carlos Zambrano , Marshall , Marmol , Greg Maddux and Mark Prior and/or Kerry Wood and/or some offseason acquisition and/or one of the highly touted minor-leaguers actually performing close to expectations . And as long as Cubs fans are going to dream , they might as well dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota Twins had n't been so cost-conscious five years ago in the baseball draft , they would have taken Prior with the No. 1 selection . Instead , they opted to take a high school player from the Twin Cities area . <p> Regrets ? Not by the Twins . Not with the choice  --  catcher Joe Mauer  --  leading all big-league batters with a .386 average . Not with the Seattle Mariners ' Ichiro Suzuki ( .366 ) the only challenge to Mauer becoming the first catcher since the Boston Braves ' Ernie Lombardi in 1942 to win a batting title . <p> - San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds has an oblique injury . St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols has an oblique injury . Obtuse thinking might make a connection . <p> - Oh , for the days when Cecil Fielder was swatting home runs , and the only question about his performance-enhancing substances may have involved triple cheeseburgers or the like . <p> - A 50-game suspension by Major League Baseball for a pitcher who likely never will be in the big leagues again . That ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that commissioner Bud Selig does n't rule with an ironic fist . <p> NOTEWORTHY <p> The " Late Show With David Letterman " list of " Top 10 Signs You Have World Cup Fever " : <p> 10 . You change your name from Kenny to Pele . <p> 9 . On tax return you list occupation : Hooligan . <p> 8 . After you successfully toast an English muffin , you rip off your <p> shirt and run around the house . <p> 7 . Whenever the mailman shows up , you scream , " Maaaaaiiiiilllll ! " <p> 6 . You have a tattoo of Czech striker Pavel Nedved on your posterior . <p> 5 . You replace your hairpiece with chunk of sod from Wembley Stadium . <p> 4 . Aches , a rash and vomiting  --  oh , I 'm sorry , those are signs you have Bird Flu . <p> 3 . In accordance with league standards , you 've inflated your pants to 8.5 pounds per square inch . <p> 2 . Every four years , you walk around in a Brandi Chastain sports bra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUDDHIST MONKS BETTING ON CUP <p> It would seem a sure thing <p> Cambodia 's Buddhist monks are n't betting on World Cup contests . <p> Wan na bet ? <p> Some monks apparently have , and the head of that country 's Buddhist monks is concerned . <p> Supreme Patriarch Non Ngeth has said the monks may view the matches on television  --  provided the holy men do not cheer or become excited . The monks usually do not watch TV . <p> Buddhism 's strictest laws say they should forgo pleasurable activity . <p> The monks can watch the games on TV , but they may not bet on the games , " Non Ngeth told the Associated Press . So far , I have received some complaints that some monks are betting during this World Cup tournament . <p> Cheering or screaming while watching TV are acts appropriate for children . Monks may not act like that . " <p> COMEDY <p> ( NL ) Central <p> And to think , some people do n't believe Tony La Russa ( below ) has a sense of humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewers otherwise . <p> Or at least what might pass for humor . Either that or a serious sense of sarcasm , which has been described as anger draped in humor . <p> The incident occurred Saturday in Milwaukee after La Russa 's lineup card from Friday 's game left Brewers coach Robin Yount wanting for more information . <p> Robin got in late from his daughter 's graduation in Arizona , " <p> Brewers manager Ned Yost told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . He had plane problems . And when he got the lineup card , it just had the eight starters and two relievers , and everybody else was gone . So Robin had to look up who was there as Cardinals reserves . So Robin got on Tony at home plate about not having the extra guys . <p> So Saturday when he sent the lineup card over , it had all the extra guys listed , and it had their age , their height , their weight , their wives , names of the kids for each player . " <p> Funny guy . <p> ALL IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babe <p> Getting physical and chess seem such an odd couple . <p> No odder than Australian chess star/hottie Arianne Caoili , British grandmaster Danny <p> Gormally and Armenian chess star Levon Aronian . <p> uh , wait . Even mathematically challenged Quick Hits can see those three add up to more than a couple . <p> They also added up to an incident recently at a nightclub that very well could be considered the highlight of the 2006 World Chess Olympiad in Turin , Italy . <p> Gormally , 30 , took exception to Aronian salsa-dancing with the 19-year-old Caoili . <p> I went up to him , and I punched him , " Gormally told the Melbourne Sunday Age . Which is very embarrassing to me . <p> Basically , I hit him because I was jealous . Obviously , I 've got problems with alcohol and anger , which I need to deal with . <p> I was jealous because he was dancing with her  --  maybe I was also a bit jealous because he 's the world No. 3 and I 'm the world <p> No. 200-and-something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna Kournikova of chess , " although the dark-haired beauty 's resemblance seems more gender-specific than anything . <p> She 's not my girlfriend , " <p> Gormally said . She told me that she had a boyfriend in Australia . I 've never had any feelings from her that there was likely to be a relationship between us besides friendship . But it does n't matter  --  sometimes you just fall in love with people , and that 's what happened . " <p> Caoili 's mother , Annette , downplayed the incident . <p> This is just a storm in a teacup , " she told an Aussie media outlet . It 's just the typical thing is n't it ? Sex , beauty , scandal , even the so-called chess nerds , as the world sees them  --  it sells . <p> I mean , she 's not Madonna for heaven 's sake .

But when he does finally retire , we probably will take a year off from everything , just to take some family time and some down time . But that 's not to say that it will be forever . " <p> This has been a great way to generate money , " Favre said . I think it 'd be hard to substitute something else . We 're always looking for something else to help raise money , and there seems to always be something that pops up . This has been great , as well as our golf tournament . So we 'll see . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fade from the limelight . It 's happened to every guy that 's played . I think the people here in Wisconsin , I think we all know have backed their players and have backed this team unlike any other team . So , in some ways , I would say yes , but I think it would still be hard to generate as much money as we have throughout the long haul . " <p> Favre 's Fourward Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million for youngsters in Wisconsin and his native Mississippi since it began in 1996 . <p> You know you 've been around awhile when the guys you played with are now coaching on your staff , " he said . And half of the coaching staff is younger than you . And you look at the roster and guys were born in the ' 80s . That 's when Deanna and I started dating , ' 83 .

Of course I was sorry , but what can one do after a lost match ? I can not cry for a week because of that . " <p> Switching surfaces from clay to grass is not of great concern for her .
