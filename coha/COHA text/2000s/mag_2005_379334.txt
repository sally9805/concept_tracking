Naguib Sawiris likes to think of himself as a Middle Eastern Richard Branson . Last year the Egyptian entrepreneur started Iraq 's first mobile-phone network . After just six months , his company , Orascom Telecom , already had more than half a million subscribers , earning $95 million before taxes and interest . Like Branson , Sawiris is a music lover  --  he calls himself a " party animal "  --  and has a taste for risky ventures . <P> " It 's one of our most profitable operations , " says Sawiris , 50 , sprawled on a leather chair in Orascom Telecom 's ornate Paris office . " I take a lot of risks , but calculated risks . " Now Sawiris stands on the edge of his biggest gamble , and it 's not in an unstable country . This month he closed a massive $15.6 billion deal with the Italian utility Enel to acquire a 62% stake in its mobile-phone network , Wind . Sawiris borrowed more than $12 billion to pay for it all . <P> Sawiris is no bootstrap entrepreneur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father Onsi made his fortune in Egypt in the 1950s in the construction industry but then lost it all when President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the business in the early ' 60s . After living in Libya , the family moved back to Egypt a decade later . There Sawiris Sr. built his fortune anew . He has since divided his empire among his three sons : Naguib , the eldest , took telecommunications ; Nassef , the youngest , runs the construction business ; and Samih , the middle brother , has a tourism and travel company . <P> Naguib seems to have inherited his father 's golden touch . Over the past six years , Cairo-based Orascom Telecom Holding has grown into an increasingly profitable company , with more than $4 billion in revenue and 17.1 million subscribers in Muslim countries , including Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . <P> Although Sawiris has always been able to rely on family money , his path to international success has not been entirely straight . He was once bailed out by Yasser Arafat , the late Palestinian leader , who approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 . <P> Since getting back on its feet , Orascom has jettisoned some markets , including Chad and Ivory Coast , and concentrated on a handful of key nations . At the top of the list is Algeria , where Orascom has more than 70% of the market . The firm also has 6 million customers in Pakistan . <P> The Wind buyout has some investors puzzled because it runs counter to Sawiris ' strategy of investing in underserved Middle Eastern markets . Wind , with 12 million subscribers , is Italy 's third largest mobile-phone service , but it has never made a profit . Moreover , given Sawiris ' focus on bringing phone service to developing countries , it 's hard to see the attraction of Italy , a wealthy nation saturated with telefonini . That 's one reason Sawiris is investing his own money , not Orascom 's . " It does n't fit , " he acknowledges  --  at least not for now . Yet Sawiris can point to his record of success in unlikely places : " When I went into Algeria and Pakistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm crazy because I 'm in Iraq .
