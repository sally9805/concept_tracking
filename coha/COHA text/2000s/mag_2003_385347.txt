I won the fat war BOB BELIVE BEAT ALCOHOL , CIGARETTES , FAT  --  AND INERTIA <p> I was sitting on the couch , Scotch in hand , watching Larry King interview celebrities about their alcohol addiction . " I 'd come home every night and pour myself a drink whether I wanted it or not , " said one . I looked at the glass in my hand and thought , " That 's exactly what I do . " <p> That program shook me up . I knew I smoked too much , ate too much , and drank too much , but for the first time I found myself wondering , " Am I an alcoholic ? " Panicked , I quit drinking cold turkey . I was so scared and determined that it was surprisingly easy . After just 3 weeks , I felt more energetic than I had in years , and I lost 15 pounds , bringing my weight down to 230 . Inspired , I turned to my unhealthy eating habits next . Out with the Fat <p> In my early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive attitude and Weight Watchers meats . That success taught me that I could lose weight by eating the right foods in modest quantities . Unfortunately , I had long since forgotten that important lesson . <p> Usually , I 'd skip breakfast , wolf down a huge Italian sub at lunch , and snack on chips and sodas all day . After work , I 'd meet friends for a happy hour of fatty foods and beer . Then I 'd head home for another cocktail , a steak dinner , and an evening of snacking on nachos in front of the TV . <p> Motivated by my weight loss , I began eating breakfast daily : cereal , a small banana , and fat-free milk . An apple before lunch took the edge off my noontime hunger . Then I 'd eat a green salad tossed with a small chunk of cheese , and I 'd be satisfied . For dinner , I replaced my usual red meat choices with halls chicken breast ; instead of filling my baked potato with butter and sour cream , I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked haddock rather than a steak , and I 'd skip the beer and appetizers . Up from the Sofa <p> The more weight I lost , the more energy I had , and the more I was able to do . Rather than spending hours snacking in front of the TV , I tackled household chores . I painted every room in the house ! <p> After 6 months , I 'd gone from a 44-inch waist to a comfortable 38 . After a year , I 'd lost 100 pounds and was down to 145 , a healthy weight for my 5 ' 5 " frame . But I looked like a deflated balloon . <p> It was time to tone up . Five sit-ups , five push-ups , and a handful of exercises with light weights were all I could manage . I added one situp or a few reps with the weights every other day . In 3 months , I was up to a 30-minute regimen that included 55 sit-ups , 65 push-ups , various stretches , and a number of weight exercises such as biceps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could see definition in my muscles . Off the Butts <p> A heart attack and triple bypass in 2001 , 3 years after I had stopped drinking , showed me that there 's always room for improvement . Age , stress , and years of smoking had taken their toll on my body . I immediately quit smoking and , on the advice of my cardiologist , started walking . I began with half an hour a day A month later , I was doing 3.5 miles in an hour every morning . I 've kept that up every day since . <p> Today , I 'm more active than I 've ever been . I still watch what I eat , but I can allow myself slightly larger portions and occasional treats ( ice cream , cookies , even a drink ) thanks to my increased activity . Some people ask me if I crave cigarettes , junk food , or my evening cocktails . I do n't miss them any more than someone might miss biting their nails . Breaking one bad habit at a time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Name : Bob Belive <p> Current Age : 50 <p> Weight Lost : 100 lb <p> Successful Strategies : No more alcohol , a low-fat diet emphasizing portion control , strength training , tackling one problem at a time Alcohol Calories Add Up <p> Even if you 're not overindulging , alcoholic beverages can contribute a lot of empty calories to your daily intake : 12 ounces of beer is 150 calories , 5 ounces of wine is 100 calories , and 1.5 ounces of liquor is 100 calories . And the foods you eat while you 're drinking are often high in calories  --  a double whammy . So simply cutting back on alcohol can do wonders for your waistline like it did for Bob . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BEFORE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Drink less , eat less <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Bob Belive <p> As told to Shelly Reese <p>
