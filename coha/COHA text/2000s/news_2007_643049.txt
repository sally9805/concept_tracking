<p> That Don Imus can be abrasive and offensive is undeniable , but he is also one of the most successful and influential pitchmen in the history of radio , if not broadcasting . <p> In the last few weeks , Mr. Imus has provided a forum for a Democratic presidential aspirant , Christopher J. Dodd , to announce his candidacy and promoted a book from Simon &; Schuster ( " Green This ! Volume 1 " ) that his wife , Deirdre , wrote about cleaning products she conceived . He also pumped sales for a country singer , Martina McBride , and raised millions of dollars for an Army medical facility in Texas . <p> His program generates in excess of $20 million in annual revenue for CBS Radio , his primary employer , and his flagship New York station , WFAN , according to two people apprised of the show 's finances who spoke on condition of anonymity . When advertising revenue for affiliates and MSNBC , which simulcasts the program , is included , the figure exceeds $50 million . <p> But yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a racially disparaging remark about the Rutgers women 's basketball team , he demonstrated that the brand he was having the hardest time selling was his own . <p> His plea that the Rutgers team agree to hear his apology directly  --  a request he renewed yesterday during a live , combative interview on the " Today " program  --  was answered . <p> In a midday news conference at the Rutgers University athletic center in Piscataway , N.J. , one player said that the team would soon meet privately with Mr. Imus . <p> Whether Mr. Imus can use the team 's gesture to help save his broadcasting career  --  he begins serving a two-week suspension on Monday  --  remains unclear . As CNN broadcast pictures of the players arrayed on a stage behind their coach , their faces long and at times streaked with tears , several prominent advertisers announced plans to distance themselves from the talk show host . <p> Staples , the office supply chain , as well as Miralus Healthcare , a pharmaceutical company that makes a headache medication called HeadOn , said yesterday that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulcast of Mr. Imus 's radio program and run their commercials elsewhere . <p> Some advertisers had left the Imus program before last week 's remarks . AT &T; stopped advertising in January , and General Motors stopped its radio ads ( though it still broadcasts TV commercials with the simulcast . ) <p> Procter &; Gamble went a step further yesterday . It said that , for now , it had withdrawn all its advertising from MSNBC 's daytime schedule  --  a potential loss of more than $560,000 on an annual basis for the Imus simulcast alone , according to figures from Nielsen Media Research . <p> " We have to think first about our consumers , " said Jeannie Tharrington , a spokeswoman for the consumer products manufacturer , " so anyplace where our advertising appears that is offensive to our consumers is not acceptable to us . " <p> Procter &; Gamble 's response underscored a delicate balance that has existed on " Imus in the Morning " for years . For those who have been the beneficiaries of Mr. Imus 's largess , putting a product or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roulette wheel . Sometimes , he will talk about someone after a thoughtful 12-minute interview of Senator John Kerry or Senator John McCain that is as substantive or illuminating as any on programs like " Meet the Press . " <p> Other times , he might sing a person 's praises after uttering an ill-considered remark or after a member of his supporting cast had done a scalding send-up of such regular targets as the embattled United States attorney general , Alberto Gonzales ; the mayor of New Orleans , C. Ray Nagin ; or Cardinal Edward Egan of New York . <p> " It 's a double-edged sword , " said Bo Dietl , a former New York police detective who appears weekly on the program to plug his private security business . " I do the show because the power of that show is enormous . But I 've also lost a lot of business for being on that show . " <p> That said , the program , which draws an estimated two million listeners and viewers each day , is lucrative for Mr. Imus 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is also lucrative for Mr. Imus  --  he earns an estimated $10 million a year , and has signed a five-year contract extension  --  and , at least until recently , his show had provided a lift to any number of ventures . <p> That may be at least partly why many of those who have gained from their associations with Mr. Imus  --  whether politically , financially or through the abundant publicity  --  were sticking by him yesterday , as he continued to lament his dismissal of the Rutgers team , most of whose members are black , as " nappy-headed hos . " <p> On the campaign trail , Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. McCain , two Republicans who have appeared on the program , said they found the comment wrong and offensive , but said they believed that Mr. Imus was sorry . Each said he intended to appear on the show again . " I called him a little while ago to talk to him about it personally , " Mr. Giuliani said . " And I believe that he understands he made a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued statements criticizing Mr. Imus 's original remark , but sidestepped any question of whether they would go back on the show . Mr. Kerry noted his apology . <p> While expressing his disappointment in Mr. Imus 's remark about the Rutgers team , Peter Osnos , founder and editor at large of PublicAffairs books , said he hoped Mr. Imus would not lose his job  --  a punishment that the Rev. Al Sharpton , among others , has demanded . <p> " He 's not a philistine , " Mr. Osnos said . " He 's not a bigot . But he was a jerk . " <p> " I would prefer not to see him driven off the air , " added Mr. Osnos , who recently placed Mr. Kerry , co-author with his wife , Teresa , of " This Moment on Earth : Today 's New Environmentalists and Their Vision for the Future " on Mr. Imus 's show . <p> Indeed , outside of rare berths on " Today " or more frequent but still difficult to place bookings on " The Daily Show With Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arenas with the reach and influence of Mr. Imus . <p> In the wake of the firestorm over his remark , Mr. Imus has pledged to purge the most offensive humor from his program . <p> " In that spirit , " said Stuart Applebaum , a spokesman for Random House Inc. , whose imprints include Random House , Doubleday , Crown and Knopf , " our publishers will also evaluate their future advertising commitments for the program . " <p> Similar internal discussions are under way elsewhere . <p> Lumber Liquidators , a hardwood flooring company in Virginia , said its agreement to sponsor portions of Mr. Imus 's radio show was coming up for renewal , after its initial year . Tom Sullivan , the company 's chairman and founder , said that as recently as a few weeks ago , its continued association with Mr. Imus would have been a sure thing . Now , he said , he was unsure . <p> " I 've been thinking about it the last few days , " he said in a telephone interview . " My girlfriend is black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , he said he might well extend the contract , at least partly because advertising on Mr. Imus 's program had brought him new business , especially from customers in the New York area with high incomes . <p> Ultimately , whether Mr. Imus returns to radio and television after his suspension  --  and if so for how long  --  could rest with advertisers like Mr. Sullivan , and of listeners . <p> " My bet is he survives , " said Larry Gerbrandt , senior vice president and media analyst for Nielsen Analytics . " I think it 's the principle here . You ca n't let third parties decide corporate policy . " <p> He added , " If the notoriety pushes up his ratings , he could even come out ahead . " <p> If the calculation were purely financial , both CBS Radio and MSNBC would have strong incentive to keep the program . <p> Beyond the rights fee it pays to CBS Radio to simulcast the program  --  about $4 million a year  --  the MSNBC show costs the network only about $500,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . If the channel had to replace the show with three hours of regular news coverage , " it would cost far more money than that to produce " an MSNBC executive said . <p> And CBS Radio could little afford to lose Mr. Imus 's cash stream , as it continues to reel from both the defection of Howard Stern to Sirius Satellite Radio and the failure of its efforts to institute a standardized format ( known as Jack-FM ) across the country . <p> And yet Mr. Dietl , the former detective , said he worried about the appeal of an Imus program without humor . <p> " If you handcuff him and just take away the entertainment , " Mr. Dietl said , " it 'll just become like any other talk show .
