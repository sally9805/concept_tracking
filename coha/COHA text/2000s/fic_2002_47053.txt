Don Webb 's sly , unusual stories have appeared in scores , possibly hundreds , of markets over the past two decades . His books include Uncle Ovid 's Exercise Book , Essential Saltes , The Double , and Endless Honeymoon . He lives in Austin , Texas , and knows a lot of esoteric things , not the least of which is where the reference to Harry Stephen Keeler lies buried in this story . Don says he is teaching a summer class in Writing Science Fiction for UCLA extension ( uclaextension.com ) , and that he is looking for a few great students . If you 're thinking of applying , do not - repeat , not - attempt the following exercise at home . This is the work of a trained professional . These stunts might look easy , but ... <p> UPON MY RECENT DIAGNOSIS with Carson 's Syndrome , I realized that it was time to talk about the creation of Wilson Is Not Toast , which has the dubious distinction of being mentioned in every book on the oddball novels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , even being a Mystery Club Book of the Month and having translations into twenty languages and adaptations for the WWW , film , TV , and other media . If you are at all a mystery reader , you probably have a copy at home . What makes WINT so interesting is that it had eleven co-authors. jointly written books seldom do well , but the author list for WINT has several other peculiarities . Firstly all of the authors had had only one publishing credit before the publication of WINT , in a regionally distributed short story collection , which was aptly described as " dreadful vanity publishing at its worst . " Secondly , despite the huge success of the book , only three of the writers went on to publish anything thereafter and their minor attempts were frankly published because of their connection with the successful Wilson Is Not Toast . I was the best published of the three . I am Moses Gubb , and I went on from my success with WINT into a writing " career " of seven mystery short stories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am very grateful to the editors of Has-Beens on Parade for this opportunity to share these reminiscences from my early career . I know that many people would be offended at being solicited by such a fanzine , but I am not in total denial on my lack of writing success , and I feel that my work in WINT is one of the most satisfying of my life . First let me tell you a little about myself . Not that I was born and so forth , you probably have a good idea about that , no , I want to explain the late twentieth century to you . Everyone wanted to be a writer , because a good deal of effort in the craft seemed to have been removed . My mother had told me with horror that in her first job she had a manual typewriter . It was one of those tales of " how bad it was " that ranked up there with the idea of a TV without remote control . There were all kinds of software in those days that helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with both words and plot , and they even encouraged you if you stopped writing due to some form of block . I remember when the first time my computer got the ( as it was then called ) World Wide Web . It was as much of a breakthrough then as doing away with keyboards had been a few years before . My job1 or as we said then , my job , was manager of a video store in Austin , Texas . It was the " cool " video store next to New Atlantis , which was a used bookstore , and a bar called the Decline of West . It did n't pay for shit , but it did bring in a steady group of artistic people . Austin was sort of a writers " colony in those days . You could n't spit without hitting a published author . I know because I spit a lot , mainly just at the people walking by into Violet Crown Videos . My girlfriend worked for me and made even less . We considered ourselves to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . Unlike our clientele , we had n't achieved in any art form . Now , we were smart enough to see writers do n't have any money , or they would n't have grumbled so at the dollar-a-day late fee on their DVD 's ( I 'm guessing that the readership of HBOP is historically savvy enough to pick up on most of my quaint terms . If they ai n't that 's too bad because I 'm not being paid for this ) . But everyone was working on something . Neal , the stock boy , was working on a screenplay , Susan on her novel , and Tagi on an opera . Belinda , my girlfriend , had done some painting that we used to fix a hole in the roof of our garage . I had learned to play " Stairway to Heaven " on the guitar , and even worked in a band that got to play at a couple of parties , until some drunk guy threw our drummer into the river . But we began to get the wannabe spirit . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled with it , clearly most of it turned out by people less smart than us , if not in fact less talented . I asked Mary Denning , a founder of the Contrarians , a school of Austin writers , what her secret was . " Persistence , " she said . I figured I could try that a while , at least until it got boring . Picking what to write was the next hurdle . I asked all the writers that came in what sold , and they all said mysteries . So I got some mystery writing software , and I took off . My first novel was entitled The Woman with Three Breasts . I thought my grand climax was stunning , " She gazed horrified at one of three breasts . It was made of wax . " It took me months to write and despite my sending it to three or four publishers , I could n't sell it . Therefore , I decided to try my hand at short fiction . That way I would n't spend so long at creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had joined a group of people that wanted to write mysteries called People Who Want to Write Mysteries PWWtWM ) or as they affectionately called it , " Pootem . " The group brought famous people in the field of mystery writing to Austin - agents and publishers and such - which would surely snap up some of the locally produced delicacies . So we both attended and shelled out money for workshops . We watched other people being published left and right . In fact , at our first workshop the woman who had sat to the left of me and the man who had sat to the right of me both sold a mystery novel in a month . Was there some cosmic conspiracy against us ? I wrote many short stories in those days , " The Dairy Queen Murders , " " The Jell-O Slayer , " " The Pork and Bean Menace . " But none of them sold . One was even returned to me with a thin pencil scrawl , " It 's the food guy again . " I would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Horace Greenslau came on the scene . Horace appeared in the form of unsolicited e-mail ( or as we called it in those halcyon days , " Spam " ) . Horace presented himself to the brethren and cistern of Pootem as a wily old publisher with many tricks up his ink-stained sleeves . He pointed out two facts . Fact number one : the second sale is easier to make than the first , so if you want to be a published author , the best thing you can be is already published . Fact number two : you do n't have to pay dead guys anything but respect . His e-mails to Pootem just talked about these ideas , he said he just kept thinking about them . So one day I sent a note to this list saying why not put them together ? You could put a book that was half stuff by dead guys that you did n't have to pay any money to , and half by living guys that were first time writers . What a great idea ! wrote Greenslau . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven writers , mixed with eleven classics of detection . It would be called Mystery Classics . He had some has-been guy , D. B. Bowen , author of The Cellophane Fawn Trilogy , on hand to write an intro for five hundred smackers . He would mention the twenty tales one by one and thus give illusion that the new guys ranked up there with Chandler , Borges , Doyle , and so forth . The classics were great , from literary to hard-boiled , impressionistic to great logic tales . There was only one rub . Money . He did n't want to do it as a vanity press , no , that was evil . He simply needed each of his writers to buy - say - two hundred copies . They could easily sell them to libraries , specialty shops , their friends and relatives . What proud momma would n't buy a book that listed her baby son after Agatha Christie ? He would sell the rest . I know what you are thinking . Well , it 's easy to think things like that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you that you can sell two hundred books . Belinda and I figured it this way . I could put a display of the books for sale at the store , plus I could take a suitcase full of them to our family reunions , then when the store sold off its used videos at the flea market in the spring I could sell a few more copies then . Before long we could sell our four hundred . So we coughed up the cash and we wrote our tales . Mine was " The Butcher Wore Red " and hers was " The Video Store Murders . " Nine other people in Pootem likewise coughed up the cash . The books took a long time to materialize . Since we had never met Greenslau , we began to wonder if we had been scammed . When the books did show up , they were as nicely produced as we had imagined for the rather hefty price we had put out . Belinda and I had visualized them as leather bound with gilt lettering and quaint illustrations ( at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us for a black-and-white photo . I guess he had merely asked for his collection , there were n't any pictures in the book . Bowen 's introduction was a little weird too . He wrote very perceptive things about the classic tales , but made fun of us . For example , " In Moses Gubb 's " The Butcher Wore Red " we see an interesting attempt to turn a food obsession into a tale of detection . Although the astute reader will have guessed the identity of the killer long before the end of the tale , his obsessive writing will have a special appeal for a certain type of reader interested in the workings of the authorial mind . " Sad to say , mine was not the worst . But it was a book . It had an ISBN number . It , for the most part , spelled our names right , and it was a hardback , not something easily recycled . It would live on in libraries and bookshelves of our friends . To my surprise and initial glee , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note when everyone 's book was delivered reminding him or her it had been my idea . The local paper reviewed us . The reviewer liked all the things the dead people had written . It called the editor " only half bad . " Our relatives did buy copies . But our friends could n't afford them . Local specialty shops like Adventures in Crime and Space were willing to buy a couple , but the look of pity in the eyes of the owner did n't make us feel very good . You know , nobody buys expensive anthologies at flea markets . But some people did ask our advice on how to get published . Then I started getting little nasty notes from my fellow authors . They had all laid out nearly three thousand dollars apparently for the purpose of losing closet space . Nobody blamed Greenslau ; everyone remembered that I had thought it up . Your most noble moments may be like the seeds of a dandelion , but e-mail lives forever . ( Well , at least it did in those uncivilized days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell copies . One of our members , a dentist , did sell his off to his clients , but he offered them a price break on his services . The few books we gave away as review copies showed up in used bookstores around town , anchors in the cheap bins . I lost my friends in the group . I lost Belinda for other reasons , but when she left me , her copies of the book stayed in the garage . Fine . I made a pile of them and propped up a roof beam . I became guilty . I felt that it was my fault . The least I could do was buy up the cheap copies of the books around town . They usually went for one or two bucks . I made a game of it , wearing dark glasses and pulling a hat over my face , I would go out and bag a few on nights of the new moon . I do n't know how many copies I had bought before I discovered that there were variant editions of Mystery Classics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales by the eleven masters and eleven people I had never heard of . There was an introduction by D. B. Bowen for eleven writers  --  all of whom lived in Houston , Texas . So I went out in my garage . The books looked the same on the outside , but close inspection soon revealed that I owned the Santa Fe , Dallas , and Anchorage versions of Mystery Classics . I drove to the copy shop and began shooting copies of the alternate title pages . Each edition had its own editor , some fall guy ( or in the case of Anchorage fall gal ) that had had the same " brilliant " idea that I had had . I spent all night addressing envelopes . I wanted all the Austin writers to know . To know that I had n't done it . To know that somewhere Mr. Greenslau was traveling from town to town raking in the dough from would-be writers . I had to use snail mail ; they would n't take my calls anymore . At first my fellow writers were n't concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little about contacting the other victims , but mainly we were embarrassed . Most of us had had friends that had warned us that the whole thing smelled like a scam , and we were embarrassed . But Belinda changed all that . She set up a mailing list for us all and she wrote a really impassioned letter about how I had been screwed over . She told them that I had paid for her books , and that I had bought all the copies , and that I had taken all their abuse ( including hers ) , and that I had let them know what had happened . She was really mad at Greenslau , and when people realized that I was out over six thousand dollars , they got mad too . I think it was Dr. Ellison , the dentist , who suggested that we should get our revenge . We agreed early on but we did n't know how . Belinda began researching the place that had printed all the books , it was in Polk City , Iowa . Other than printing Classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their equipment was old , and the CM line kept them going . They were very friendly , and were glad to give her a list of cities that had had CMs made up . We looked it over . Greenslau had neglected New Orleans . We could n't guess why , maybe he thought the bunco squad there was too good . So we got a local ISP and we made a group , Crescent City Crime Writers . We got us a webpage , we took out some ads in the New Orleans Picayune , and we mentioned our name on a few mystery news groups . We had people that wanted to join of course , but we told them that we had already filled our meeting space - some unspecified loft on Canal Street - and that it would be a while before we were taking members , but they were free to chat . We adopted pseudonyms , we chatted , and we even learned some things about the city of New Orleans and its rich mystery tradition . Eventually someone made the observation that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published . His name was Redslaw . Mr. Redslaw went on to tell us that the reason dead guys are reprinted is that they sell and you do n't have to pay them . Therefore , I went on-line as Mr. Phineas Thibodaux , an honest but poor man of the parishes with a great marketing strategy .... Mr. Redslaw thought my notion of an anthology of half classic and half virgin talent was nothing short of genius . He said he could get a hasbeen writer , a Mr. D. B. Bowen , author of The Cellophane Fawn Trilogy , to write an introduction . Here is where we made our move . We said that we wanted to meet him , Mr. Bowen , of course . We had figured out that much . At first there was reluctance . Redslaw told us that Bowen was reclusive , alcoholic , etc . We stuck to our guns , and Belinda had a brilliant idea . She researched Bowen . He had written five avant-garde novels in the eighties . The CFT had been marginally successful . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch . He had speaking tours , was a minor TV celeb , but each novel got stranger and the readership declined . He even tried vanity publishing with - you guessed it - the Menu House in Polk City . So in addition to our wanting to see him , we began to say good things about his work . There is n't a writer alive that does n't believe flattery . The entire strange cursed race thinks that someday their scribblings will have a place in God 's eternal bookshelf . Our plan was a little vague . We thought that we would get him in a hotel room and then just confront him and in some magical way he would pay us back the money he had sucked away . We chose an older hotel in the French Quarter called the Roosevelt . We rented the big penthouse that had looked over Mardi Gras for almost a hundred years . It was bleak December . We told him to meet us at eight on a Wednesday night . We dressed well , and those of us who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no intention of killing him , just scaring him into the straight and narrow . Belinda had a tape recorder so we could catch any confessions that might boil to the surface . He was fifteen minutes late . We were sweating and uncomfortable . We heard the old elevator make its way to our floor . Belinda and a woman named Chandra Lee escorted him to our suite . He was older and thinner than we had thought . We had our chairs arranged in a circle , his was in the middle . He laughed when he saw it . We guessed he would n't be laughing soon . After he had sat down , we all reached under our chairs and pulled out a copy of Mystery Classics , except for me . I pulled out five copies - one of each of the editions I had bought . We were expecting fear or guilt . We were disappointed . He just asked , " So which group are you ? Shreveport ? Dallas ? No , I guess it 's too long for it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we want our money back . " " Oh , that 's original , " he said , relaxing in his chair . " About as original as your fiction . " Then he laughed . " Look , Bowen , we 're not fooling around , " said Dr. Ellison . " Of course you are , " said Bowen , " That 's all you 've ever done . You 're jerk-offs . What do you want from me ? You said you wanted to be published . Well , you got your book . It 's big , it 's fat . I bet all of you have discovered the great utility it has for propping things up . You should be as happy as a pig in slop . But no , what you wanted was n't to pay three thousand dollars so that your useless names would be printed alongside people that would sneer at your ineptitude . You wanted more . You are disappointed that I am not Satan . You wanted to sell your souls for fame . Well , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't got shit . " " No , Bowen , " I said . " We 've got you . " " You think you 're the first group that has pieced this together . You 're not , and you 're not the last . But everything I did was legal . I knew this was a confrontation when I walked down here . Night meeting in an old hotel in the French Quarter , the same old cliched stuff that keeps your fiction from selling . I just wanted to see your pathetic faces , look at you , all dressed up , all proper ; does it make you feel powerful ? Your little chairs all in a circle . Well , I 'm going now , and you can go back to your lives and tiny dreams . " " Do you think you are a good writer , Bowen ? " " I 'm no Rex Hull but I 'm okay . I 'm third-rate , but my ambition is too great . So I look for eighteenth-rate scum to support me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellison . " We are not done with you . " " Why , what are you going to do , kill me ? " " Yes , " Dr. Ellison said . " We are . Just because you are n't expecting it . It is a sign of the triumph of our poor imaginations . We were on him in a minute . Eleven people can overpower a man in his sixties easily . Killing him is easier still . Taking a corpse through the French Quarter is not a difficult matter when he is small . You simply stand on either side of him and tell onlookers that he has had too much to drink . In fact as we took him to my car , we passed another fellow in the same straits . Perhaps he too was dead . We took him to my cousin 's restaurant . We sat outside until closing time . My cousin and I had an agreement . He did not ask about things that he did n't want to hear the answer to , and I treated his life the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jambalaya . The other men butchered him , while I prolapsed the rice and sauce as per the recipe in my story . He was ready at dawn , and we filled up our containers with him and took him to our homes in Austin . Just before we took off , Belinda said , " Well , he 's toast now . " I most emphatically denied that he was toast , and took offense at the slighting of my culinary creation . " Okay , " she said , " He is not toast . " We were prepared to be each other 's alibis when the law came by . It never came . Bowen did live alone . He was the alcoholic recluse he claimed to be . Eventually the residence hotel he lived in in Washington must have noticed that their tenant had not returned . The others had sworn off writing , but I turned out a few tales afterward - some of which sold . I felt my fiction getting better , and attributed it to some endorphin released after revenge . About six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Roosevelt Penthouse . She called me and said that it was very dramatic . The whole thing would make a lovely crime novel . So we broke it into eleven chapters . Each of us did our best . And unlike most of our scribbling before and after , our best was finally good enough . Sure , the novel sold as something of a curiosity , like Naked Came the Stranger , but it did sell . We had a few minutes of fame - woefully short of the fifteen minutes that a man named Andy Warhol had promised our parents " generation . The success of the book , plus my modest sales before its publication , inspired everyone to try writing again . We had all felt the writing we did on WINT had been smooth and beautiful . We were all able to get agents on the strengths of WINT 's sales , and we were busy turning out novel proposals . But something was wrong . The quality left our writing . At first we hid this each from the other . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer can not bear to acknowledge that his best days may be gone - especially if his best days were about a month in length . However , by the time the movie of WINT came out , our writing was as bad as it had been in Classic Mysteries . We did n't know what had happened . Had the crime been enough to stimulate our moribund muses ? Dr. Ellison suggested a different explanation . Over half a century before , certain experiments on planaria learning had suggested that cannibalism led to the exchange of knowledge . The planaria , a type of flatworm , were tested with a maze and their times recorded . Then the planaria were ground up and fed to a new generation , who could solve the maze in less time than their predecessors . It was speculated that there was a transference of knowledge - probably in the messenger RNA strands of the planaria . The experiment was later discredited , as some researchers believed that the mazes were contaminated by the smell of the flatworm 's passage and that was the guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discredited to keep universities from turning into professor-hamburger stands . Hoc est corpus meum . Maybe we had eaten Bowen 's talent . Unlike him , we were not jaded nor overcome by a desire to be known in a limited genre - we were just people with a burning desire to write , but perhaps nothing to say . Our desire plus his RNA got one more novel out of him . It was sad that he never got the fame , which he , like us , had craved . The RNA material must have peaked in us about nine months after the deed and receded nine months afterward . Our reaction to Dr. Ellison 's theory varied . Some of us were glad at our one shot at fame and parlayed it into little victories like my cookbook . Others drank themselves to death like Belinda , who could never face the fact she had no talent . Of course the best known case - the one you 've been reading this interview to see if I would mention - see , I still have a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Ellison . One of the good dentist 's clients was Vernon Ghosh , a well-known writer of techno-thrillers . Ellison gassed him when he was in for his yearly dental visit and then cut up his body with an eye to making lasagna from it . The unfortunate visit of a young man with a chipped tooth exposed Ellison 's attempt at cannibalism . Ironically it led to new interest in our work and a re-release of WINT , which has remained in print since . We all denied any understanding of his actions , and if in our black hearts we had been thinking of a similar deed , we abandoned such evil schemes . Although not quite the youngest of our little group of wannabes , I am the last to draw breath , and I will not do so for much longer . I enjoyed sharing our story for Has-Beens on Parade .
