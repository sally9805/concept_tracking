In a circuitous way , I 'm at the Belfry for one simple reason : I do not believe in the legend of Vermont 's Jay Peak , which lies just a few miles up a narrow , winding , frost-heaved slice of pavement from the Belfry . Oh , I believe in Jay skiers like Wetherbee , whose left wrist lies on the bar like a wounded animal . He broke it skiing , and of course he skis with it broken . This is no small matter of pride , which I know because of how much he downplays it . " I call it brain-dead mind over matter , " he says . And I believe in the Belfry , the local 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a practiced hand and the chair backs are draped in well-worn Gore-Tex and the parking lot is ringed by snowbanks higher than the peak of my hat . What I do n't believe in lies up the road a ways ( or up the road a piece , as it 's said around here ) . It 's the legend that says Jay Peak is like no other mountain in the East  --  that snow falls there in such abundance and is of such quality that skiers will drive through the night , passing by other mountains of equivalent vertical and terrain , drinking bad coffee and listening to bad radio stations and nosing their cars into furious storms for one simple reason : They believe . 2004-2005 : 327 inches . 2003-2004 : 361 inches . 2002- 2003 : 304 inches . 2001-2002 : 378 inches . 2000-2001 : 581 inches . 1999-2000 : 488 inches . Those charged with the marketing of Jay Peak would like you to think that the numbers tell the story , that every storm takes skiers , quite literally , closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eastern North America " and " It 's all about the snow " and " Welcome to the Deep . " It is fair to say that Jay Peak , which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year , has staked much on its reputation as the snowiest mountain in the East . It 's gone to great lengths to market the mountain as the antidote to the bumps and boilerplate typical of the region as a whole , hosting the East 's only International Free Skiing Association-sanctioned big mountain competition , leading the open-boundaries charge long before other Eastern resorts , and feverishly thinning steep lines in the woods . Unquestionably , it 's worked . Jay 's annual skier visits have risen by 20,000 over the past half-decade . There 's the Canadian contingent , mostly Montreal-based rippers willing to wait through long border-crossing lines on powder mornings . There are the dedicated U.S. urbanites making the five-hour midnight runs from Boston . And there are the local boys and girls , smug in their belief that they live where everyone else wants to ski . When I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why would I leave Jay 's snow and terrain to go looking for Jay 's snow and terrain ? " But perhaps Jay 's marketing department has it all wrong . If the legend of Jay Peak is built on what falls from the sky , then the hard , tangible truth is built on people who thread narrow tree lines with broken wrists and spend their Wednesday evenings making jokes about it . Just take William Akens . Poor Billy . It 's not yet 9 A.M .. on Tuesday , February 22 , and already things have gone all to hell . First came the slow realization that he 'd left his skis  --  a pair of Line Assassins mounted with Rottefella telemark bindings  --  in the rack at Jay 's Stateside lodge the night before . Then came the drive up the hill to the Jay parking lot from the yurt he shares with his buddy Chris Casey , two miles that proved to be two too many for the clutch in his 13-year-old , Bondo-spackled pickup , which was already running on only three of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road home is entirely downhill , Akens gives me a wan smile . And I shut up . Akens and Casey , best friends since they met in college in the early ' ' 90s , have spent the past seven winters in their yurt , relying on gracious landowners to provide a patch of soil on which to erect it . They 've had to move it only once . Casey spent a year living in Vail , another year bumming around British Columbia , and yet another in Stowe , before settling on Jay . " I 'm here for the snow and the terrain , for sure , but I 'm also here for the scene , which basically is n't one . " Right now , the snow is about as good as it gets . Jay 's been in the flow for the past two weeks , soaking up nearly five feet of low-moisture Clipper dust out of Canada . The night before , nine inches had fallen , buttering the already creamy snow and soothing the angst of a certain ponytailed man of 34 who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was only a few hours ago . The 10 inches are n't vastly more than other Vermont resorts received , but it sure as hell is n't less , either . Akens and Casey and I boot up and hop on the Stateside Triple . ( Jay has two base areas : Stateside  --  so named because it 's the area of the resort farthest from Quebec  --  and Tramside , where the bulk of skiers converge . ) The Triple accesses the Dip , a wide apron of moderate-angle woods that 's technically out-of-bounds and demands a short shuttle , both convenient factors in that they discourage widespread pillaging by skiers unfamiliar with the area . On big days , or on busy weekends when the rest of the mountain is clogged , it 's not uncommon for locals to spend the entire day in the Dip . A dozen Dip runs in a day is a possibility . Impromptu shuttles run regularly  --  every year , Wetherbee invests in a dilapidated minivan , rips out the backseats , sticks a bottle of something high-test under the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , there are inbounds stashes on Jay . Over on Tramside , Beyond Beaver Pond is one of the mountain 's better-known treed sections , thanks to thoughtful thinning and a **31;2918;TOOLONG pitch . The Face Chutes drop directly off the peak to skier 's right of Tuckerman Chute , another pencil of a line that 's good for maybe three laps . On Stateside , Kitz Woods and Timbuktu are the glade runs of choice for those not aware of  --  or up for  --  the carshuttle options . But they ai n't the Dip , which on this day is skiing spectacularly . On each run we find snow that 's never seen P-tex . Casey is absolutely flying , his bobbing , athletic style the perfect match to the Dip 's fully chargeable lines . Wetherbee 's in there too , knocking off smooth tele turns with one pole , his wrist cast held protectively against his chest . I 'm following , honoring unstated Powder Law Number Three , which conveys firsttrack rights to locals , all while thinking that there might just be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . And Akens ? Akens is smiling again , his ponytail flying in the air behind him , his mind no longer dwelling on stolen skis and a rust-shot truck . It 's called the Jay Cloud , and depending on whom you talk to , it 's either gospel  --  or more marketing run amok . " They 've pushed the Jay Cloud so much that if Smugg 's has 10 inches , we 've got ta have 18 , all because of the Cloud , " Wetherbee had told me that night at the Belfry , referring to the ski area to the south , Smuggler 's Notch . " I mean , look at today . They advertised 35 . I 'll kiss your ass in public if it was over 30 . " He 'd thumped the bar with his cast for emphasis . At the time , I 'd almost argued that in powder-skiing terms , the difference between 30 and 35 inches was largely academic , but I caught myself just in time . Either way , I did n't want my ass kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of huge powder days , I 'd need all the help I could get . Still , Wetherbee  --  as fervent a Jay supporter as exists  --  gave credible voice to the primary knock against Jay : Is it possible that it has painted itself into a corner ? That by virtue of receiving more snow than other mountains in the area , and by reporting with , well , perhaps optimism is the kindest word , it has created a situation whereby anything less than more is n't enough ? To find out , I pay a visit to the basement weather station of Jim Roemer , a tall , thick-chested , outspoken meteorologist who 's made a career out of providing weather reports to skiers and ski resorts , including Jay . On the day of my visit , a nor'easter is marshaling its forces and tracking along a path that should deposit it directly over Jay . Despite a case of the flu , Roemer is in a fitful state as he pulls up the National Weather Service forecast , which is calling for a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roemer , making Holstein , the 20 pounds ' worth of cat dozing on his lap , twitch his ears . " We 're gon na fuckin " get nailed here . The NWS has their head up their ass . " Spittle , which I deftly avoid , flies from his lips . " Fuck , man . I 'm gon na go three feet . " Roemer mashes a thick finger against the dot on his computer map that represents Jay . " Look , the Jay Cloud exists , it 's a real thing . Part of it is just because it 's colder up there . At 32 degrees , an inch of moisture is worth 12 inches of snow ; at 25 , it 's worth 15 inches ; and once you get below 17 degrees you 're looking at 30 inches plus . So if it 's five degrees colder at Jay , they 're gon na get more snow . " Then he points slightly north of Jay , where there is ... nothing . " See ? See that ? There are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go south , " he slides his finger down the screen to the northern tip of New York 's Adirondacks , " and you 've got mountains to the west of Vermont . " Those peaks create what 's called shadowing , which , in stark skier 's terms , means that if you 're not skiing Jay , then someone else is getting the snow that was supposed to be yours . Roemer agrees that Jay sometimes exaggerates snowfall , but only " as much as anyone else . " The reality , according to Roemer , is that Jay 's snow totals fall somewhere between the marketing department 's hype and the pundits ' pessimism . " They 're getting 10 to 15 percent more snow , there 's no question about that . " And then he turns his eye to the map that depicts the gathering storm as an angry swirl of yellow and green . " Look at all that fuckin " moisture ! " More spittle . " Look at it ! " Holstein scampers from the room . There 's no denying I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've pointed my old pickup north , and on four mornings I 've been greeted by a deep layer of powder . But if I 'm no longer a skeptic , I 'm also not yet a believer . After all , the entire northern half of New England has been in the same storm track , and conditions are epic regionwide . I could have pointed my truck at almost any northeastern mountain and found the same thing . Then came Big Jay . Situated slightly south and west of Jay Peak proper , Big Jay is accessed via a 30-minute skin ( if the skin track 's smooth ) from the tram and is widely regarded as the finest piece of liftserved backcountry skiing in the East . It 's rumored to receive even more snow than the main mountain , though no one measures , so it 's impossible to verify . Skiable lines drop a healthy 1,800 or so feet , down a pitch that 's extraordinary not so much for its steepness ( though it probably averages 35 degrees ) as for the consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the difficult access , the level of skill it demands , and the long runout dissuade the masses . Still , it 's a crucial part of Jay 's mystique . When conditions are right , Akens and Casey make the trip daily . It 's now two days after my visit to Roemer , the storm is just winding down , and the yurt boys are antsy to make a run of it . Whoever cut these lines knew exactly what they were doing . On Big Jay , more than any piece of treed terrain I 've skied , the shots open and shut at precisely the right moments . Just as you start feeling claustrophobic , just as it starts to seem as if the course you 're on can only end badly , you spy a slot and beyond it a wide expanse of white , and you slip through and you 're in the goods again . At the top of Big Jay we stop to take our climbing skins off and shrug back into our shells . It is quiet ; the wind has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 're not making much . The snow is thick on the ground , and even on fat skis , we 're sinking to our knees . Turns out , Roemer was right on target . We beat skier 's left , to the outermost , least-trafficked lines . But with conditions like these , it hardly matters where we go . Akens jumps in first , pumps a few quick turns , and slips out of sight . Casey goes next . And me ? I pause , looking over my tips at one of the sweetest lines I 'll ever ski . Then I drop , and it 's not mere belief I feel as snow billows over my head . Hell , no . It 's faith .
