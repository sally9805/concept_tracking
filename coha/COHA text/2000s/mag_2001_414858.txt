Setting your own business hours can pay off big , as these four women prove , // Who has n't fantasized about living the work-at-home life ? You ca n't beat the perks : flexible hours , a slacker-worthy wardrobe , the precious balance you 'd finally strike between work and family . Yet leaving the corporate world in pursuit of this haveit-all lifestyle has traditionally meant a big financial trade-off . Sure , you 'd be freer to volunteer for car-pool and cafeteria duty , but you would n't be earning a full-time salary . Working at home , it seems , has long been another way of saying working for less . The Internet has changed all that . A recent study by the U.S. Small Business Administration found that home-based companies now comprise 52 percent of all U.S. businesses , and they 're not necessarily run by part-timers who are looking to make pocket change : The National Survey of Entrepreneurial Parents revealed that 22 percent of women who run a full-time business from home pull in $50,000 or more a year , and 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it 's easy . Bringing your professional and personal lives together under one roof is like introducing two strangers with entirely different needs and expecting them to live together 24 hours a day . The success of the coupling is dependent on the ability of one ( the professional you ) to coexist in a space originally claimed by the other ( the personal you ) . True , the commute is only 30 seconds ( depending on traffic between the breakfast room and the spare bedroom that doubles as your office ) ; yes , you 're free to begin and end your workday when you want ; and certainly those Friday lunches with your husband can become more than just a goal . But running the kind of business that will pay you $50,000-plus a year often means you 'll work long hours and sacrifice vacations and other perks during the two years it takes , on average , to turn a profit .

" On these pages , four intrepid women tell what it really takes to make serious money while working at home and still have the family life you want . Is it simple ? No . Doable ? Absolutely . MICHELLE MM 33 , ST . MICHIEL , MN Michelle Mix had one goal when she launched her embroidery business , Mixed Thredz , five years ago : permanent flex time . She envisioned someday attending the after-school events of her daughter , then a newborn . She wanted to stop what she was doing at 2:20 every afternoon , the minute her 5-year-old son walked through the door . She wanted to take Fridays off during the summer so that she and her kids could go to the beach with their neighbors . " Friends say , You 're lucky to be home while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I want to be at home even after they become teenagers . " Mix first enrolled in sewing classes at a local textile school and began making children 's clothing and bridal gowns for friends and relatives . The money supplemented her husband 's income from construction , but it was n't enough . Then she attended a trade show and saw a demonstration of a commercial embroidery machine . Mix and her husband , Dave , 34 , pooled their resources and took out a loan to buy a machine . Then she began calling on local sporting- ( continued ) goods stores that needed logos applied to uniforms , sweatshirts , and jerseys . In less than six months she made $50,000 . Photograph Rx for success : Got comfy at home , and get out and meet with clients . // Today Mix owns two more machines plus assorted other equipment , employs two other moms as assistants , and handles the embroidery and applique needs of four sporting-goods stores through which she helps outfit 25 school teams .

" While the machines run , I get the kids ready for school , make breakfast , do car pool , " says Mix . " Then I come back home and work . Five o'clock is shutdown time . Everyone goes home to make dinner and bathe the kids ; then at 8 p.m. , I start up again . I work most nights until eleven or midnight . " Her current schedule leaves little one  --  on-one time with her husband , but at least her office is just upstairs . Often after the kids have gone to bed , Dave will go into " Michelle 's Batcave " to catch up . " When we chose to have children , we knew we 'd have to make sacrifices as individuals and as a couple , " says Dave . " This is the best choice for our family .

She 'd recently sold her share in an antiques business to prepare to be a stay-at-home mom ; after watching half a dozen of her own antiques go for $22,000 online , she had a brainstorm : Why not transfer her expertise ? After Emily ( now 21/2 ) was born , Fox approached her former business partners and various dealers about letting her sell their collectibles online in exchange for a 3 to 20 percent commission . Last year she grossed $63,000-without any of her clients hearing Barney in the background . Fox finds that e-mail lets her juggle the needs of her daughter with those of her clients  --  especially important now that she 's separated from her husband . " It 's not like I 've got a customer standing there waiting for me , " she says . " Everything I do , I can walk away from and come back to an hour later .

" I did n't have a grand plan , " says White . " All I knew was that I was miserable in my job and wanted out . I was looking for quality of life .

To keep start-up costs down , she furnished her office with a folding banquet table borrowed from her father and a " ridiculously uncomfortable " wooden chair . ( Seven years later , the chair sits outside her office as a reminder of how far she 's come . ) Her first year in business was tough . White had cleared $22,000 and was projecting earnings of $70,000 plus , but she was regularly putting in 100 hours a week , which left no time for friends and little , if any , for her husband . Her sleepless nights became his sleepless nights ; their social life became nonexistent ; whenever they scheduled a vacation , she 'd cancel at the last minute . Over dinner one night her husband told her , " I do n't like who you 're becoming . What do you plan to do about this ?

White , who now coaches executives at Procter &; Gamble , Fidelity Investments , and a number of dot-coms and oversees a virtual staff of 32 other coaches , recently used her experience to write Work Less , Make More : Stop Working So Hard and Create the Life You Really Want .
