Mercury : The solar system 's inner frontier <p> Not far from the sun lies a tiny planet with a big image problem . A fleeting presence often hidden by the sun 's glare , Mercury is the neglected child of the solar system . <p> Planetary scientists have preferred to gaze upon more exotic-looking orbs than pockmarked Mercury , whose appearance bears a superficial resemblance to the moon 's familiar facade . Only one mission , Mariner 10 , has flown past the planet , and it viewed less than half the surface . <p> <p> Scientists know almost as little about Mercury , the solar system 's innermost planet , as they do about distant Pluto . Simultaneously hot enough on one side to melt zinc and cold enough on the other to freeze methane , tiny Mercury represents a world of extremes that may push planet-formation theories to their limit . <p> Indeed , Mercury 's very existence can teach scientists volumes about how the other terrestrial planets Earth , Mars , and Venus assembled , says Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help scientists calculate the likelihood that other stars harbor Earthlike planets , he speculates . <p> " To understand processes that affected all the planets , we have to understand the extreme outcomes , " Solomon notes . " Mercury has the potential to give us much deeper insight into questions about how planets can assemble . " <p> Last month , at the spring meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington , D.C. , scientists discussed Mercury 's many mysteries as well as plans by two space agencies to investigate those puzzles . NASA 's $286 million MESSENGER ( Mercury Surface , Space Environment , Geochemistry , and Ranging ) spacecraft would examine Mercury 's atmosphere and entire surface for 1 Earth year with a suite of detectors including cameras , spectrometers , and a magnetometer . <p> <p> The European Space Agency 's more ambitious proposal , not yet funded , consists of a trio of spacecraft called BepiColombo . The craft include two satellites and a vehicle that would land on the surface , deploying a tiny , tethered rover . <p> " One of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to see the half that 's never been seen before , " says Mark S. Robinson of Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill . <p> Faithfully following the sun over the horizon at sunset or appearing in the dawn 's early light , Mercury as seen from Earth never strays far from the star of the solar system . When directly overhead , it 's swamped by scattered sunlight . Although it 's easiest to see when it hangs low in the sky , Mercury 's light must then pass through 10 times the usual thickness of Earth 's turbulent atmosphere . As a result , most ground-based telescopes produce blurry images of the planet . <p> Earth-orbiting telescopes do n't have to contend with atmospheric blurring , but many of them , including the Hubble Space Telescope , ca n't peer anywhere near Mercury , lest stray sunlight damage their sensitive detectors . <p> Thus , almost everything astronomers know about Mercury comes from Mariner 10 , which studied the planet during three flybys in 1974 and 1975 . The spacecraft , however , always imaged the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But what the spacecraft did find stunned researchers . Most scientists had assumed that the planet , geologically dead on the outside , was just as inactive on the inside . At Mercury 's equator , however , the craft detected a persistent magnetic field of a few hundred nanotesla equivalent to about one-hundredth that of Earth 's . <p> <p> The only convincing model to account for planetary magnetic fields relies on the concept of a dynamo . In this scenario , the continual rise and fall of molten , electrically conducting material deep within a rotating planet generates an electric current . The current in turn creates a magnetic field . <p> Could a planet as small as Mercury , which should have cooled substantially since the birth of the solar system , stay hot enough to keep its core partially liquid ? The riddle is all the more puzzling because a planetwide system of huge cliffs attests that Mercury has indeed cooled and shrunk . The cliffs represent places where the planet has buckled as it vented its heat and contracted , explains Clark R. Chapman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MESSENGER , scheduled for launch in 2004 and entry orbit around Mercury 5 years later , will be able to check whether the planet has a liquid outer core , says Solomon , principal investigator for the mission . <p> To do so , the craft will precisely track the planet 's rate of rotation . Mercury 's rotation varies because the sun 's gravity creates a twisting force as the slightly eggshaped planet follows its elliptical path around the sun . The twisting force would cause the rotation rate to vary by twice as much if Mercury 's surface floats on a partially molten core than if the entire planet is solid , scientists calculate . <p> Instruments aboard both MESSENGER and BepiColombo will measure the tiny oscillation . In combination with new gravity maps of Mercury , obtained by measuring how much the spacecraft speeds up or slows down as it passes over different parts of the planet , the MESSENGER experiment will determine the size of the core and how much of it is solid . <p> Mercury 's composition also poses a puzzle . Mariner 10 data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude that it must be two-thirds iron . " It 's by far the most metal-rich planet , " notes Solomon , and researchers are n't sure how it assembled . <p> Standard theory suggests that all the planets condensed from a swirling disk of gas and dust that swaddled the young sun . Small grains in the disk collided and stuck together to form bigger and bigger particles , which eventually grew into planets . <p> Interactions between the embryonic particles underlie a planet 's composition . Because the inner part of the solar system disk is denser than the outer regions , the drag force between particles there is larger . Drag slows lighter-weight materials , such as silicates , much more than heavier particles . Once they decelerate , the silicates spiral into the sun . This leaves a much higher concentration of metals in the inner part of the disk , where Mercury assembled , than in more distant reaches . <p> However , that theory may not entirely explain the planet 's high density , notes theorist Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other terrestrial planets was probably gathered over a wide range of distances in the inner disk , including regions where the metal density was lower than that of Mercury today . <p> In another scenario , ultraviolet light from the young sun shining on a fledgling Mercury might have burned off a crust of low-density rock , leaving the planet as an iron-rich cinder . According to a third theory , collisions with an asteroid as large as Mercury could have drastically altered the planet 's composition , stripping away light-weight minerals from the crust and upper mantle . Both these alternative theories allow for the possibility that after Mercury formed , it migrated in from farther out in the disk . <p> Although scientists have yet to determine which model is correct , a recent analysis of Mariner 10 images by Robinson and G. Jeffrey Taylor of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu suggests that Mercury arose in its current location and never budged . <p> From the Mercury images , as well as previous studies of moon rocks , Robinson and Taylor estimated the average amount of iron oxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , which show a relatively low abundance of iron oxide , support the idea that the planet assembled at its current location . Data from Earth , the moon , Venus , and Mars show lower amounts of iron oxide the closer a planet lies to the sun , Robinson and Taylor say . <p> Their analysis , in combination with work by Paul G. Lucey of the University of Hawaii , also supports the view that volcanic activity spawned the vast , smooth plains imaged by Mariner 10 . Researchers had already suspected such an origin but could n't prove that the material forming the plains differs from that of its surroundings . The new work indicates that the plains have a distinctive coloration and thus a different composition from adjacent areas . The findings make it more plausible that mammoth upheavals of lava once were common on the planet . <p> When it comes to extremes in temperature , Mercury is the champ . It simultaneously ranks among the coldest and hottest planets in the solar system , notes Chapman . The planet rotates under the broiling sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow rotisserie : One rotation lasts nearly half an Earth year . Because Mercury 's atmosphere is much too thin to transport the sun 's heat from the day side to the night side , the planet 's sunlit side reaches a temperature of 427degreesC , while its dark side drops as low as - 173degreesC , Chapman says . <p> Given Mercury 's proximity to the sun , finding permanent deposits of ice on the planet would seem about as likely as hell freezing over . Yet radar studies a decade ago showed that scattered areas at the north and south poles were highly reflective at radio wavelengths , an indication that the regions might contain ice . Follow-up studies have confirmed the radar findings and indicate that patches of ice might lie as far as 750 kilometers from the poles . Scientists suggest that the ice resides at the bottoms of craters where sunlight never reaches . <p> Recent evidence of water ice in craters at the poles of the moon ( SN : 3/14/98 , p. 166 ) strengthen the argument that Mercury may also have such frozen reservoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method that scientists used to search for lunar ice . The craft 's gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers will look in the polar regions for hydrogen . An abundance of hydrogen is an indicator of water . Ultraviolet spectrometers on the craft can also search for the hydroxyl molecule , an even stronger signpost of water . <p> <p> Both MESSENGER and BepiColombo plan to explore the composition of Mercury 's tenuous atmosphere . The planet 's envelope of gas is so thin that the molecules do n't generally collide with each other but bounce repeatedly off the surface like rubber balls , forming what planetary scientists call an exosphere . <p> Several processes may contribute to the buildup of the exosphere : emission of gases from Mercury 's interior , sunlight or solar wind ions evaporating material from crystal rocks , or space debris smashing into rocks and vaporizing them . To distinguish among these processes , spectrometers on the craft will compare the composition of the exosphere with that of surface rocks . <p> It wo n't be easy for a spacecraft to enter orbit around Mercury . Resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel and could n't be done with the propulsion systems available before the mid-1980s , notes Solomon . In 1985 , Chenwan Yen at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , discovered a clever way to get to Mercury . Two flybys of Venus followed by two of Mercury would give a spacecraft the gravitational kick required to orbit the innermost planet , she proposed . <p> That 's just the prescription MESSENGER will soon follow . Even with those assists , more than half the 1,097-kilogram weight at launch will be fuel , says project manager Ralph L. McNutt of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Md . An umbrellalike heat shade will shield the craft 's detectors from the relentless sun , and solar panels will help power the craft once it begins an elliptical orbit about Mercury in 2009 . Then , MESSENGER will radio back to Earth the first close-up images of Mercury since 1975 , mapping features as small as 125 meters across . <p> BepiColombo will rely on an innovative fuel to travel to Mercury . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's energy . An electric field will accelerate the ions to high velocity as they shoot out of the rear of the craft , enabling the craft to slip into orbit about Mercury rather than spiral into the sun . A combination of solar ion propulsion and gravitational boosts from the moon and Venus would give a travel time of about 3.6 years , compared with 6 years , the shortest time using ordinary rocket fuel . <p> Solar ion propulsion has only been demonstrated once beyond Earth 's orbit , on a NASA mission called Deep Space 1 . The European Space Agency ( ESA ) intends to conduct a second test flight before using the method for the first of its Mercury-bound missions in 2008 , says Rjean Grard of ESA 's European Space Research and Technology Center in Noordwijk , the Netherlands . <p> Touring Mercury , the planet gripped most tightly by the sun 's gravity , also presents an opportunity to test with unprecedented accuracy Einstein 's theory of general relativity . That theory describes exactly how the sun curves space-time and so affects the orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature two missions a spacecraft that will explore Mercury 's magnetosphere and a small lander that will plunge into the surface of the cratered planet . The Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter will have a highly elliptical orbit , enabling the cylindrical craft to investigate the outer edge of the planet 's magnetic field , some 12,000 km from the surface . <p> With luck , the magnetosphere mission will begin taking measurements while MESSENGER is still touring Mercury . " Having two spacecraft taking comparable observations at different orbits at the same time gives you a three-dimensional view of Mercury that 's enormously valuable , " says Solomon . <p> The missileshaped lander will penetrate 2 to 3 m into Mercury 's soil , leaving its top poking out just a few centimeters . A camera on an extendable mast will image the surroundings in exquisite detail . Other instruments will measure the flow of heat from the planet 's interior , record quakes , and assess the magnetic properties of surface rocks . Connected by an umbilical cord to the lander , a minirover will carry an alpha X-ray spectrometer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , in 2009 , ESA plans to launch another craft , which will fly over Mercury 's poles , imaging features as small as 10 m across . Solar cells will cover three sides of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter , which will be shaped like a truncated pyramid . <p> The studies , adds Grard , have implications far beyond our planetary system . " As far as we know , the terrestrial planets are the cradle of life in our solar system , " he says . " Now , we have a big question : Is there life anywhere else in the universe ? " <p> Understanding how every terrestrial planet formed and survive even those that do n't contain life may shed light on how some planets may have managed to become a haven for living things , Grard notes . <p> Mercury , the tiniest and in some ways the most bizarre member of the terrestrial family , may have a lot to answer for . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A cliff more than 300 kilometers long extends diagonally from upper left to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 in 1974 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Artist 's rendition of the European Space Agency 's proposed Mercury lander and its tethered rover . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Mercury as seen by the Mariner 10 spacecraft 25 years ago .
