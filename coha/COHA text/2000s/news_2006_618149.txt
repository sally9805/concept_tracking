<p> Jimmy Lee Sudduth and Mose Tolliver , two old masters in the relatively young discipline of American folk art , have had to put down their paints this year due to advancing age and declining health . <p> That means that for the first time since Folk Fest was launched 13 years ago , neither of these towering figures from Alabama will be represented by brand-new work when the annual show and sale opens its three-day run Friday at Gwinnett County 's North Atlanta Trade Center . <p> To be sure , plenty of Sudduth and Tolliver paintings will be for sale among the 90 gallery and dealer-run booths ( at prices from as little as $150 to upward of $1,500 ) . But the absence of recent pieces by the self-taught artists , both ultra-prolific for decades , is sure to be felt this weekend and more so in years to come as the number of their available works dwindles . <p> The popularity of vernacular art exploded in the 1980s , and Sudduth , of Fayette , in northwest Alabama , and Tolliver , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of self-taught makers with original visions . Their works are considered building blocks in any private or museum collection , while many art enthusiasts without serious holdings have fallen for the colorful , accessible works by Sudduth and Tolliver as well . <p> Recent years have been particularly hard on the folk-art community , as longtime creators such as the Rev. Howard Finster and R.A. Miller , both of Georgia , passed on after decades-long careers . Tolliver , in fact , is the only surviving artist among the 20 included in the 1982 landmark exhibit " Black Folk Art in America , 1930-1980 , " organized by Washington 's Corcoran Gallery of Art . <p> Folk art 's future would seem to be less secure than its storied past as museum curators , gallery owners and collectors try to sort out ( to borrow a George Jones lyric about irreplaceable country greats ) " who 's gon na fill their shoes ? " <p> Trailblazers <p> Fortunately , Sudduth , 96 , and Tolliver , in his 80s ( reports of his birth date vary ) , are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sudduth , who has had heart troubles for years , had to move into a Fayette nursing home when his cousin , O.C. Sudduth , himself in his mid-80s , grew too frail to continue looking after him . The artist , who requires oxygen on and off , is limited to drawing occasional small sketches but unable to work with painting materials at the care facility . <p> Tolliver suffered a stroke that has exacerbated his deteriorating mental and physical status . Now blind , he 's no longer able to paint but remains at his home on the edge of Montgomery 's downtown . Daughters Annie Tolliver , herself a folk artist , and Doris Jean Tolliver take shifts caring for their father . On bad days , he does n't recognize family members , reports Montgomery folk-art gallery owner Marcia Weber . <p> Calling Sudduth and Tolliver " my idols , " Alabama folk artist Woodie Long says the silencing of their artistic voices " breaks my heart ... <p> " They are folk art , " Long says . <p> Susan Crawley , the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises Sudduth and Tolliver as " highly visual visual artists . <p> " In other words , they are fascinated by the physical appearance of the world and ... preoccupied with conveying their visual perceptions in their own way , " she says . " You can see joy in the physical world in the paintings of both : in Tolliver 's free and ebullient handling of forms and in Sudduth 's painterly delight in the medium itself . " <p> Weber considers them trailblazers equal , in terms of inspiration , to the great musicians at the birth of jazz . " They painted what flowed naturally out of themselves , what they felt , and it was often not recognized as being art , " she says . " Frankly , they did n't know how to spell ' art . ' Others had to explain to them that they were creating art . " <p> ' Sweet mud ' stylist <p> Sudduth and Tolliver both grew up in agricultural communities , with little formal schooling , and worked as gardeners after moving to cities , explaining the recurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet their output reflects more differences than similarities . <p> His mom a forager of the woods for homemade cures , Sudduth began drawing on trees with charcoal and mud starting at age 3 and never veered from a love of natural materials in his nine-decade career . <p> He became famous for painting with " sweet mud , " a mixture of some of the three dozen different hues of dirt that he boasted he could find in Alabama alone . He 'd dab the mud onto boards with his fingers , and to make it adhere , he experimented and determined what worked was adding sweet stuff such as sorghum syrup , sugar , even Coca-Cola . <p> For color , he 'd use house paint and extract tints , especially in the early days , from rose petals and pokeweed berries , green pine-straw boughs and gravel , coffee grounds and turnip greens . <p> Initially , Sudduth mainly depicted things from his life : roosters , cabins , horses , cows , his succession of dogs ( all of which he named Toto ) , Fayette landmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jack Black , director of the Fayette Art Museum . It took a while for Sudduth to show Black the paintings he did at night . Black then followed his gardener 's work for a number of years before organizing a 1971 show at the museum  --  almost as a novelty , the late curator once acknowledged . ( It came two years after the artist 's debut exhibit , at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa , Ala . ) <p> Sudduth scored his national breakthrough in 1976 , when he was invited to Washington as a guest artist at the bicentennial edition of the Smithsonian 's Festival of American Folklife . <p> That trip and other travels heightened Sudduth 's interest in architecture , and over the years he 's repeatedly painted detailed renditions of the U.S. Capitol , Manhattan skylines and sassy takes on Lady Liberty . <p> These more complex and often larger compositions  --  and Sudduth 's production in the face of growing demand by those making the pilgrimage to Fayette  --  were helped by his increased use of paint starting in the 1980s . <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painting or two  --  more like the Jimmy Sudduth Experience . Sudduth would demonstrate his mud painting style , endearingly boast of his growing fame , and pull out albums of Instamatic shots of various patrons ( mostly female and mostly blond , not coincidentally ) hugging and kissing him . No visit was complete without Sudduth playing songs such as " You Are My Sunshine " or " John Henry " on his blues harmonica . <p> Sophisticated vocabulary <p> While Sudduth prospered in relative geographic isolation , Mose Tolliver turned to painting out of physically imposed isolation . <p> In the late 1960s , he was sweeping floors at a Montgomery furniture company when a box of marble fell on his legs , crippling him . A company official , who painted as a hobby , encouraged Tolliver to take fine-art painting lessons . <p> Equally true to the DIY aesthetic of folk art and to his own proud nature , Tolliver decided instead to teach himself . He painted a red bird with house paint and sold it for $3 . Many more birds soon took flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , landscapes . He dangled his paintings from trees in his yard and on his front porch wall , where they caught the eyes of passers-by . He and his wife , Willie Mae , had 11 children , and art provided after he was disabled . <p> The Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts gave him his first one-man show in 1981-82 ; the nationally touring Corcoran exhibit opened later in 1982 . <p> Though he never stopped producing quick-selling , simplistic pictures of birds , sliced watermelons and the like , Tolliver developed a sophisticated visual vocabulary . His paintings of " moose ladies , " depicting spread-eagled females straddling phallic-like scooters , are the sort that temporarily come off many a collector 's walls when proper company is expected . But Tolliver often seemed in a playful mode when painting erotic figures , whereas his straight-on portraits ( and self-portraits ) were more challenging and edgy , his characters frequently staring directly at viewers with ambiguously cool expressions and straight-lined lips . Yet around these haunting countenances often would swirl gorgeous patterns and dabs of paint , applied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tolliver could also be political , with pictures referencing aspects of the civil rights movement , such as his many takes on an empty " Freedom Bus . " And after he was photographed under Gilbert Stuart 's portrait of George Washington during the Corcoran opening , he frequently did his own powerful portraits of the first president . <p> No matter the subject , one of folk art 's most recognizable signatures was printed near the bottom : MOSET , in capital letters with the S reversed . <p> Depending on his mood , Tolliver could be cordial , businesslike or difficult to the parade of would-be buyers who passed through his two-story yellow house . After wife Willie Mae 's death in 1991 , if he was not off at one of his girlfriends ' places , he 'd sit regally on his unmade bed in the front room , gallons of opened house paint and his walker close by , rough-cut plywood boards on the easel that was his lap . <p> Equally memorable <p> Long visited Sudduth and Tolliver dozens of times over the years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the artists  --  as being completely different , if equally memorable . <p> " The first time I met Jimmy Lee , as I left , he was out in the road blowing my wife and I kisses , " Long recounts . " Jim 's a spirit , whereas Mose can be contrary as hell . One time , he was wanting a beer badly early one morning , and he could n't find his keys to the refrigerator , and he was mad . He had a gun out and was going to shoot the lock off , and I told him , ' That refrigerator wo n't keep ice if you put holes in it ! ' Unlike some people , I never took him anything to drink ; I always took him fruit and vegetables . But that morning I went and bought him two Busch Light beers . " <p> Now the days of blown kisses and nearly blown-up fridges are in the rear view for Sudduth and Tolliver , and folk art , it would seem , will never be the same . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he painted with his fingers : " That brush do n't wear out . When I die , the brush dies . " <p> * * * <p> Mose Tolliver <p> Born : July 4 , 1924 ( according to daughter Annie Tolliver , though his birth date has been reported to be as early as 1916 ) , Montgomery County , Ala . <p> About his work : " He enjoyed abstracting forms and would copy his own copies of pictures until they bore very little resemblance to the form that originally inspired him . He plays with the elements of his designs in ways that a less confident artist might avoid . Like Jimmy Lee Sudduth , he enjoys the visual or formal qualities of his painting ; that is more important for him than conveying a spiritual meaning . " <p> ( Susan Crawley , High Museum associate folk art curator ) <p> In his own words : " I ai n't interested in no art . I just like to do my pictures . " ( From the 1994 book " Revelations : Alabama 's Visionary Folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 10 , 1910 , Caines Ridge , Ala . <p> About his work : " He reached the height of his powers in the 1980s when he was exploiting the texture of mud and the fluidity of paint ; at the same time , his drawing , which was once very tight and precise , had become free and expressive . Although he 's most famous for his use of mud and other natural materials , he is a gifted painter with remarkable formal skill . His work reveals a wide range of subject matter , amazing technical ingenuity , and a fine eye for color .
