ATHLETES GET OBSESSED WITH their equipment . And with good reason . The style of ski or bike they use can mean the difference between winning and losing in split-second finishes . <p> " Innovation is paramount in this industry , " said Roland Alonzo , who designed a new mountain-bike suspension system . " The technology is fast-moving and can change every six months . " <p> The 2stage mountain-bike suspension system designed with 3-D CAD by Roland Alonzo is active in proportion to pedal force . The suspension system does n't switch abruptly between riding modes . <p> He should know . After many years of riding mountain bikes , Alonzo had an idea to help the bikes ride easier , he said . He fooled around , sketched his idea in 2-D programs , and created the final digital prototype in a 3-D CAD package . <p> Rear-wheel suspension systems are a fairly new addition to mountain bikes , Alonzo said . They help bikers ride over rough terrain and race downhill . <p> But the rear-suspension bikes can be hard to pedal because these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one for bumpier , he said . The transition between these two modes can be abrupt . And because it happens automatically , the rider ca n't control it . <p> Alonzo 's 2stage system is always active in proportion to the pedal force . So the bike ride is more pedal-efficient and the suspension system does n't switch abruptly between modes , he said . <p> Alonzo created his first 2-D sketches in Adobe Illustrator on a Mac . To create a 3-D wireframe model , he imported the 2-D graphics into the 3-D CAD modeler Rhinoceros , from McNeel North America of Seattle . Human Model <p> ONE MEDICAL MODELING COMPANY uses CAD software to make sure its models are anatomically correct - down to the smallest detail . <p> The company , Zygote Media Group of Lindon , Utah , builds and sells detailed 3-D models of the human body that are based on data from magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography . <p> Models include the human skeleton , heart , arteries , nerves , and muscle tissue . Zygote 's customers use the CAD models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and video games , said David Dunston , Zygote executive partner and designer . <p> The company 's CAD models have appeared in movies like Hollow Man , in television commercials , and on The Discover ' Channel . They 've also made appearances in a host of textbooks , university classrooms , trade journals , and corporate training videos , Dunston said . A biomedical company may use the 3-D heart models to develop stems or a skeletal model to design a brace to straighten a crooked spine . <p> " The software allows us to apply detailed MRI and CT scan data we 've generated to create extremely precise solid models , " Dunston said . <p> The company uses SolidWorks CAD software to build the models . Joints in a Crash <p> COMPUTER SIMULATIONS CAN BE cheaper than crash tests , but they do have a downside . <p> According to Silke Sommer , a researcher at the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials in Freiburg , Germany , conventional simulations do n't fully take into account the rupture of auto body joints , rivets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important because a midsize car is held together by about 5,000 spot welds , nearly 400 feet of adhesive joints , and numerous rivets , Sommer said . <p> If those joints or welded areas were to split in a collision , a part of the auto body could penetrate the vehicle and injure occupants . The Fraunhofer team has created a computer model that depicts what would happen to those areas during a collision , said Sommer , who headed the project . <p> To populate the model , research engineers first had to take a step back and examine the automobile 's individual joints in a tensile testing machine . For instance , they analyzed what happens to a spot weld under tensile , shear , bending , and torsional loading conditions . <p> The research engineers inserted the various joint models into the crash model . Researchers can now model their own simulations by adjusting the joining method and the design of the body in white to their own needs . What Lies Ahead <p> BY MAKING EDUCATED GUESSES about how best to traverse unfamiliar terrain , robots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Robots often rely entirely on sensors to guide them . But the sensors are sometimes inaccurate , and the robot can stray slightly off course , said C.S. George Lee , a Purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering who specializes in robots . <p> C.S. George Lee ( left ) , a Purdue professor of electrical and computer engineering , and doctoral student H. Jacky Chang operate robots that follow a map to traverse unfamiliar terrain . <p> Lee said he 's at work on robots guided by a software algorithm that creates a map the robot can reference to predict what lies ahead . <p> As you might expect , the more repetitive the environment , the more accurate the prediction and the easier it is for the Purdue robots to successfully navigate their environments . <p> " For example , it 's going to be easier to navigate a parking garage using this map because every floor is the same or very similar , " Lee said . " The same could be said for some office buildings . " <p> The robots also rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's Round And Smart ? <p> CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS that you ca n't reinvent the wheel . But a wheel 's intelligence is an altogether different case . <p> Scientists at the University of Portsmouth in England are at work on auto wheels that automatically adjust their ride to the road . The wheel will be used on the prototype electric car made by PML Flightlink Ltd. of Fareham , England , a company that designs electronic motors but is now branching out to the electric car . <p> The wheels rely on tiny on-board microcomputers that perform 4,000 calculations per second and communicate digitally with each other . With the microcomputer as brains , the wheels automatically make calculations and adjustments according to traveling speed and road conditions , said David Brown of the University of Portsmouth 's Institute of Industrial Research . He 's part of the research team . <p> " Traditional suspension means the vehicle dips when the wheels detect poor road surfaces , and you get a bumpy ride , while a tight corner means the drag will slow the vehicle down , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterbalance this kind of drop and drag effect , but the driver wo n't even know it 's there . It means a faster car , but a safer one . " A Smaller Wheelchair <p> PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH disabilities are too small to sit in a powered wheelchair , which they often ca n't operate properly anyway . But they still need a way to get around . <p> Medical Engineering Resources Unit , a charitable organization in Carshalton , England , that develops medical products for children , has created Bugzi , an electric wheelchair to be used indoors by disabled children younger than six . <p> Bugzi is small and maneuverable and can be transported in the back of a car . It 's also adaptable to a wide range of sizes and abilities and the seat can be adjusted , said Peter Swann , head of product development for Medical Engineering Resources . <p> To help design the chair 's compound curved surfaces , engineers at the company used the 3-D CAD package Inventor from Autodesk of San Rafael , Calif . <p> Medical Engineering Resources Unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecturer in engineering design . The organization 's story and activities are published on its Web site , meru.org.uk . Jet Through Water <p> WHEN THEY ARE PERFECTED , some small submarines will move through water as a jet moves through air . <p> For the past decade , Hawkes Ocean Technologies of San Francisco has been at work on a class of small , maneuverable submarines that can be piloted through the water to a desired depth using controls , wings , and thrusters similar to those of jet aircraft . They 're meant to mimic flight - underwater , according to Adam Wright , a marketing manager at Hawkes Ocean Technologies . <p> The design and engineering firm is using analysis software to help in the development of Hawkes 's winged submersibles . <p> Engineers are now designing a two-man craft with lightweight , carbon-reinforced composite material to replace the aluminum parts of the previous model . The exterior skin is made of layered fabric composite . The submarine is rated for a depth of 3,000 feet . <p> To determine the stresses in the complex geometries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 pounds per square inch - the company uses computational fluid dynamics software from Ansys of Canonsburg , Pa . The software defines the flow of water around the craft . Engineers study the analysis results to design the craft for minimal hydrodynamic resistance and maximum lift so the submarine can dive and maneuver under water , Wright said . Machine Tool Supercomputer <p> MACHINE TOOLS TEND TO HEAT UP after they 've been running several hours . That can affect their accuracy and makes designing them very tricky . <p> Mori Seiki Co . Ltd. of Nagoya , Japan , has enlisted the aid of a supercomputer to help speed its design process and generate more accurate models and simulations of its tools . <p> Digital Technology Laboratory Corp . provides engineering consulting services for Mori Seiki and houses the new Linux Networx LS-P supercomputer . The consulting service uses a number of computer-aided engineering applications to analyze the performance of machine tools as digital prototypes . <p> After running continuously for several hours , the accuracy of machine tools can be affected by changes in their operational temperatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Traditionally , DTL carried out analysis on standard desktop computers ; however , the need for higher-fidelity models and simulations , coupled with the need to complete jobs faster , necessitated an investment in a supercomputer , said Zach Piner , director of mechanical engineering . <p> By Jean Thilmany , Associate Editor <p>
