Section : Search and Discovery The strongest force in nature has the peculiar property that quarks become oblivious of one another when the distance between them gets small enough . <p> Particle theorists David Gross , David Politzer , and Frank Wilczek have been awarded this year 's Nobel Prize in Physics " for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interactions . " The laureates are , respectively , professors of physics at the University of California in Santa Barbara , Caltech , and MIT . The discovery was made in 1973 by Gross and Wilczek ( n1 ) at Princeton University and , independently , by Politzer ( n2 ) at Harvard University . At the time , Wilczek was Gross 's graduate student and Politzer was a graduate student of Sidney Coleman . <p> Asymptotic freedom refers to the vanishing of the strong nuclear force between quarks as the distance between them goes to zero . The surprising discovery by Gross , Wilczek , and Politzer that a certain class of quantum field theories has this property led quite quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the strong interactions ( see the article by Wilczek in PHYSICS TODAY , August 2000 , page 22 ) . The dauntingly complex laboratory manifestations of the strong interactions had prompted Freeman Dyson in the late 1950s to predict pessimistically that it might be 100 years before a proper theory emerged . <p> Why call the freedom of quarks at small separations " asymptotic , " which to the uninitiated suggests large distances ? The arcane nomenclature invokes the reciprocal relation between length and momentum in quantum mechanics . The reference is to asymptotically high momenta . Probing the short-distance interaction of quarks inside a nucleon requires scattering experiments in which a high-energy probe particle transfers a large fraction of its momentum to a target nucleon . Deep-inelastic scaling <p> Quite unexpected results from a series of such experiments at SLAC had been puzzling particle theorists since 1969 . A team led by Jerome Friedman , Henry Kendall , and Richard Taylor was measuring the deep-inelastic scattering of high-energy electrons off protons  --  that is , inelastic scattering events in which the electron suffers a large momentum transfer q . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross section on q and v , the electron 's energy loss in the collision , was peculiarly constrained : The cross section seemed to depend only on the ratio q/v . <p> Theorist James Bjorken soon explained this " scaling " behavior of the SLAC deep-inelastic scattering data in terms of Richard Feynman 's 1969 conjecture that the nucleon is made up of individual pointlike " partons . " It was not yet clear that these partons were , in fact , the fractionally charged quarks hypothesized by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964 . The deep-inelastic scaling , Bjorken pointed out , would be just what you 'd expect if the electrons were scattering off partons that rattle around perfectly free inside the nucleon , unaffected by any nuclear force other than the long-distance constraint that keeps them confined . <p> This picture of partons free at short distances was appealingly simple . But it seemed to make no sense in the search for a real theory of the strong interactions . How could hadrons  --  the particles that experience the strongest force in nature  --  be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances ? In quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) , the paradigm of quantum field theories , the electric force between point charges increases with proximity . With growing distance , the effective charge of the electron is decreased by vacuum screening . The relativistic quantum vacuum , constantly sprouting polarizable pairs of virtual electrons and positrons , screens charge very much like a dielectric . That 's just the opposite of what one would need for a quantum field theory of the strong interactions that could explain deep-inelastic scaling . Down with field theory ! <p> " Field theory was in bad repute in the 1960s , " recalls Gross , " especially in Berkeley , " where he finished his PhD under Geoffrey Chew in 1966 . Chew and his disciples argued that a few very general principles such as analyticity , unitarity , and various symmetries would suffice to yield a unique universal scattering matrix for the strong interactions . Field theories , they contended , introduce unobservable , fictitious entities . In any case , the " nuclear democracy " of the so-called S-matrix approach recognized no fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every hadron species was as fundamental or as composite as any other ; and no one had ever seen a quark . But even if one could create a legitimate field theory of the strong interactions , the argument went , it would be largely useless for calculating anything because perturbation expansions in powers of the coupling constant would n't converge . Unlike the small coupling constants of the electromagnetic and weak interactions , the strong coupling constant was so big that perturbative calculations would yield nonsense . <p> As a postdoctoral Harvard junior fellow ( 1966-69 ) , Gross began a productive collaboration with Curtis Callan that continued when both moved on to Princeton in 1969 . Much of their work involved the formulation of experimentally testable sum rules based on the algebra of hadronic-current operators in quantum field theories . Current algebra was , at the time , a kind of halfway house between the S-matrix approach and field theory . Gell-Mann had pointed out that one could learn about the fundamental makeup of hadrons by abstracting rules for hadronic currents involved in electromagnetic and weak interactions from model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He likened it to the haute cuisine practice of cooking a pheasant breast between slices of veal and then discarding the veal . <p> By 1972 , the application of current-algebra sum rules to deep-inelastic electron and neutrino scattering data had convinced Gross that quarks were real dynamical constituents of nucleons . Applying the Callan-Gross sum rule to the data clearly showed that the only components of the nucleon that coupled to bombarding electrons or neutrinos were pointlike spin- objects  --  just what one expected of quarks . Applying other sum rules to the data showed that these constituents also had the fractional charge and baryon number expected of quarks . <p> " At the end of 1972 , I undertook to settle the issue of the validity of quantum field theory by proving that no field theory could explain deep-inelastic scaling , " recalls Gross . " I would show that there are no nontrivial asymptotically free field theories . " Within a few months , Gross and Coleman had largely completed the proof for most renormalizable field theories . But they had not yet tackled a particularly difficult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an abelian , locally gauge-invariant field theory . That is , the theory is invariant under phase shifts of the electron 's wave function that differ arbitrarily from point to point . Invariance is preserved by applying a compensating gauge transformation to the electromagnetic vector potential at every point . In fact , the unbroken local gauge invariance , by itself , fixes the nature of the interaction and dictates that it be mediated by spin-1 massless photons . In group-theoretic terminology , the theory is called abelian because simple phase shifts commute with one another . The Yang-Mills loophole <p> In 1954 , searching for a field theory of the strong interactions , Chen-Ning Yang and Robert Mills generalized the notion of local gauge invariance from simple phase shifts to rotations in isospin space . Just like rotations in ordinary space , rotations in the abstract isospin space do not commute . Hence the appellation non-abelian . Yang and Mills failed to find a satisfactory theory of the strong interactions , but the Yang-Mills idea of non-abelian gauge theory did bear fruit in the late 1960s , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in 1971 , Gerard ' t Hooft made the particle-physics community take the electroweak unification theory seriously by showing that such Yang-Mills theories are renormalizable  --  that is , one can subtract away the nonphysical infinities that they , like all quantum field theories , inevitably generate . <p> With Wilczek , who had come to Princeton in 1970 after earning his undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Chicago , Gross set out to complete the demolition of strong-interaction field theories . " Frank was my first graduate student , " says Gross . " He spoiled me . I thought they 'd all be that good . " Wilczek himself was particularly interested in studying the high-energy behavior of the electroweak theory . <p> In QED , as in almost all renormalizable field theories , the effective coupling constant decreases as the fermions get farther apart . It only remained to show that the same was also true for all Yang-Mills theories . The formidable task of examining how the coupling varies with distance was made easier by a renormalization-group formalism developed by Callan and , independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper by Gell-Mann and Francis Low and later work by Kenneth Wilson . In renormalizable field theories , the coupling constant must be dimensionless . But renormalization requires the introduction of an arbitrary mass scale . Of course , the observable consequences of the theory can not depend on that arbitrary renormalization scale . " This physical triviality is given mathematical expression by the Callan-Symanzik equations , " explains Coleman . " But they yield highly nontrivial information about the asymptotic behavior of the theory . " <p> The formalism introduces a differential equation that governs a function ( g ) , where g , the effective coupling constant , is itself a function of distance  --  or , equivalently , of momentum transfer . The Callan-Symanzik function is essentially the negative of the logarithmic derivative of g with respect to distance . The sign convention is important . The field theory possesses asymptotic freedom if and only if the sign of the function becomes negative as g goes to zero . The telltale sign of <p> Callan and Symanzik had provided an acid test for asymptotic freedom . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagrams corresponding to the lowest-order perturbative expansion in g . Nonetheless , the actual calculation for Yang-Mills theories was laborious and fraught with pitfalls . " Nowadays it 's a straightforward , though still laborious homework problem in field theory courses , " says Wilczek . " But the theoretical tools available back then were primitive , and it 's always easier to do a calculation when you already know the answer . " Sign mistakes were a particular hazard . " One last sign mistake convinced us for a few days that the function limit was positive  --  that we had proven what David set out to prove . " <p> But after more checking , it became clear that there were indeed asymptotically free Yang-Mills theories . For the most plausible of these , given what was known about the strong interactions , the non-abelian local gauge symmetry was invariance under rotation of the quark wave-functions in the abstract space of three " colors " described by the Lie group SU ( 3 ) . In that particular case , which soon turned out to be the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest-order term in the perturbation expansion of the function in g was proportional to - ( 11/2 - n/3 ) , where n is the number of distinct quark flavors . <p> This result implies that the theory is asymptotically free so long as there are no more than 16 flavors of quarks with masses less than qc , where q is the momentum-transfer scale at which a hadron is being probed . Three flavors ( up , down , and strange ) were known in 1973 , and there is good reason to believe that there are no more than the six quark flavors we know now . Too many different varieties of light quarks would be a problem because vacuum creation of virtual quark-anti-quark pairs tends to subvert asymptotic freedom by screening the color charge in much the same way that virtual esup+esup- pairs screen charge in QED . <p> Under color-SU ( 3 ) symmetry , each quark flavor comes in three absolutely equivalent colors . The notion of hadronic color was introduced by O. W. Greenberg and , independently , by Yoichiro Nambu and Moo-Young Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would resolve a quantum-statistics paradox in the early quark model . Nambu soon suggested a color-SU ( 3 ) gauge field as the source of the strong interactions . Color , he was saying , might be the generalized analog of electric charge for the strong force . And that , indeed , is its role in QCD . <p> Politzer 's calculation of the negative limiting sign of the function was essentially identical and simultaneous with that of Gross and Wilczek . But Politzer had come to the task with a different purpose in mind . In 1972 , Coleman and Erick Weinberg , another of his Harvard students , had discovered a possible mechanism for dynamical symmetry breaking in QED , and they had begun to generalize it to non-abelian theories . Politzer thought that calculating the function for the non-abelian case might give additional insight into the symmetry breaking , and that it might be a suitable thesis topic . <p> He assumed , at first , that the function would yield the information he sought about the low-momentum ( long-distance ) behavior of the Yang-Mills theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon found , as Gross and Wilczek did , that was negative at small g . It was useless for examining electroweak interactions at large distances , but it meant asymptotic freedom , which was just what was needed for a theory of the strong interactions . <p> In high excitement , Politzer phoned Coleman , who was spending the spring of 1973 on sabbatical at Princeton , to report his " stupendous " discovery . But Coleman put a temporary damper on Politzer 's enthusiasm . Gross , still under the influence of a momentary sign blunder , had just assured him that Yang-Mills theories can not be asymptotically free . But Wilczek soon found the offending sign error and Politzer , having rechecked his own calculation , was confident in the negative leading term of the function . The two discovery papers appeared back-to-back in the 25 June 1973 issue of Physical Review Letters . <p> The following summer , Politzer , as a junior fellow at Harvard working with Thomas Appelquist , applied the concept of asymptotic freedom to the heavy " charmed " quark , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted by Sheldon Glashow and coworkers . Appelquist and Politzer calculated that , if the charmed quark exists , it should form a bound charm-anticharm state with an extraordinarily narrow width plus a positronium-like set of excited " charmonium " states . The system would resemble positronium , they argued , because asymptotic freedom renders the strong force between the heavy quarks coulomb-like at distances appropriate to heavy-quark bound states . <p> By the time arguments with the editors of Physical Review Letters about the neologism " charmonium " had been settled , the historic discovery of the J/ ?  --  the first charmonium state  --  had been announced on 11 November 1974 . The Appelquist-Politzer paper , ( n3 ) appearing two months later , took due note of the discovery . " The discovery of charmonium was a huge psychological boost for asymptotic freedom , " recalls Wilczek . Understanding and testing QCD <p> " Our first paper ( n3 ) already had the full-blown QCD Lagrangian , " says Gross . But some things were still unclear . On its face , the color-SU ( 3 ) gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by massless spin-1 " gluons "  --  multicolored analogs of the photon . But why had n't such particles been seen ? Most likely , it seemed , the gluons were rendered very massive by spontaneous symmetry breaking , as are the heavy vector bosons of the electroweak theory . Now we know that color symmetry is unbroken and that the gluons are indeed massless but inescapably confined inside hadrons , as are the quarks . Confinement in QCD has taken longer to understand than asymptotic freedom . " I hold the minority opinion that confinement is still largely a mystery , " says Ken Wilson . <p> Despite their absolute confinement , the reality of quarks and gluons is nowadays made vividly manifest by the highly collimated jets of hadrons they occasionally generate in esup+esup- collisions at sufficiently high energies . QCD predicts very accurately the energy-dependent cross section for producing events like that in figure 1 , whose three jets reveal two quarks and a gluon . <p> Figure 1 . Three-jet events , first seen in 1979 at PETRA , the 30-GEV electron-positron collider at DESY in Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chromodynamics really exist . Though quarks and gluons are never free outside a hadron , they can manifest themselves in high-energy collisions as jets  --  that is , collimated sprays of energetic hadrons . Three-jet events like this one , recorded at PETRA by the JADE detector , ( n7 ) are rare . The three jets are attributed to a quark-antiquark pair plus a gluon . The gluon generally produces the least energetic jet ( lower left in this event ) . <p> Further strong evidence for the validity of QCD comes from small logarithmic departures from deep-inelastic scaling at energies much higher than those of the original SLAC experiments . Gross and Wilczek pointed out , in a longer followup paper , ( n4 ) that QCD requires such corrections to naive Bjorken scaling . And their prediction was amply confirmed by experiments at CERN in the late 1970s . Figure 2 shows how well QCD predicts the hallmark of asymptotic freedom , namely , the momentum dependence of the strong coupling constant . <p> Figure 2 . Strong-coupling parameter asubs , the quantum-chromodynamic analog of the fine-structure constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gluon ( asubs = g/4p , where g is the momentum-dependent analog of the electron charge ) . At asymptotically large q , which is equivalent to vanishing separation between quarks , the quarks become oblivious of one another . The data points cover an extensive variety of experimental results . The black curve and yellow swath show the QCD prediction and its uncertainty . ( Adapted from S. Bethke , http : **30;2756;TOOLONG . ) <p> Asymptotic freedom has ramifications far beyond QCD . " The weakening of the strong force at high energies , together with the mathematical resemblance between QCD and the electroweak theory , " says Wilczek , " makes possible the quantitative examination of ambitious schemes for a grand unification of the two . " Just before asymptotic freedom was discovered , Steven Weinberg had written that in the first microseconds after the Big Bang , at temperatures above 10su K , " we encounter theoretical problems of a difficulty beyond the range of modern statistical mechanics . " ( n5 ) Wilczek says that " the discovery of asymptotic freedom dispelled this pessimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually becomes weakly interacting and you can calculate its equation of state . " The laureates <p> Politzer was born in New York City in 1949 . The story is told that , after this year 's Nobel prizes were announced , he received a congratulatory call from an old high-school classmate . " I always knew , " said the classmate , " that you 'd be the first in our class to win the Nobel prize . " " Not quite ! " Politzer had to reply . He 'd been beaten to Stockholm by Russell Hulse , another member of the Bronx High School of Science class of 1966 , who shared the 1993 physics prize with Joseph Taylor for their discovery of binary pulsars . Politzer earned his undergraduate physics degree at the University of Michigan . He 's been on the Caltech faculty since 1975 . <p> Wilczek is also a native New Yorker , born in 1951 . " The commute to Bronx Science was too far , " he recalls , " but I got a terrific education at Martin Van Buren , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton in 1970 as a graduate student in math . " But taking Gross 's field theory course showed me my true vocation . " <p> Wilczek taught at Princeton until 1981 , when he moved to UC Santa Barbara , where he was appointed the first permanent member of the Institute of Theoretical Physics . From 1990 to 2000 , he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton . Since then he has been at MIT . <p> The Santa Barbara institute is now called the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics , and Gross is its director , having left Princeton in 1997 to take that post . He was born in Washington , DC , in 1941 . When he was 12 , the family moved to Israel , where his father served as an economic adviser with a US delegation . Gross 's undergraduate education in physics was at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . <p> A historical footnote : In the summer of 1972 , ' t Hooft already knew that the small-g limit of the function can be negative for Yang-Mills theories . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment he made after a talk by Symanzik . But ' t Hooft 's comment was not widely known , and he did n't publish his result until several months after the discovery papers had appeared. ( n6 ) In any case , for his earlier proof that Yang-Mills theories are renormalizable , ' t Hooft shared the 1999 physics Nobel prize with Martinus Veltman . <p> Politzer , Wilczek , Gross <p>
