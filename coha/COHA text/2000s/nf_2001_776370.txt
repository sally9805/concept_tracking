ON OPENING DAY , FIELDS OF DREAMS // Will we survive our technologies ? We are being propelled into this new // century with no plan , no control , no breaks . //  --  Bill Joy // President , Sun Microsystems // Do you know why people fear DNA ? Because criminals always leave // it at the scene of a crime . //  --  Joke told by Monsanto scientist Stephen Rogers // Genetically modified food is part of the fabric of American life . " // So says Gene Grabowski , my seat mate and a front-line player in the new politics of food , as vendors hawk hot dogs , nachos , and Crackerjacks in front of our Section 11 box seats in Camden Yards , one of America 's grand new baseball parks . Moments before , the Orioles ' Cal Ripken clunked his 2,992d hit as a Major League player into a swath of grass temporarily devoid of any Cleveland Indians in short right field . // " In a grocery , as much as 70 percent of the processed food might contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America and therefore chief spokesman of the American food industry , he ought to know . // GMOs . Grabowski is speaking in a code that most Americans have n't unraveled . In parts of the rest of the world  --  including Europe , Japan , and Brazil  --  these three letters trigger fear and befuddlement , with a measure of hope sprinkled in . As most Europeans can tell you , GMO stands for genetically modified organism , which is what you get when you move genes across the traditional species boundaries of plants and animals in the quest for new traits . // It is Opening Day at Camden Yards , and Gene has invited me to watch baseball and , as I suspected , to talk about genetically modified food . The subject has consumed us both of late , he as point man for American food retailers , who worry increasingly about the reaction to GMOs in their food ; I as a newspaper reporter writing about a powerful technology that has landed on the world with breathtaking speed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brainchild of a handful of companies that have bigger plans for re-creating what we eat . // Up to now , the DNA of plants has been manipulated to make growing them easier . Companies have profited , and farmers have saved money by heading better equipped into the battle with weeds and insects . But there 's been little in the technology to inspire consumers , which is one of the reasons that Gene is feeling anxious today . He would love to see scientists hasten their quest to produce genetically modified food that is more nutritious  --  or more appealing in any way  --  so that people wo n't be suspicious when they learn GMOs have occupied their supermarket shelves . // " So far , we 've had to be futurists , talking about the foods that will be available someday , like fruits and vegetables that can retard tooth decay . And that 's been one of the difficulties . It 's been a challenge , always talking about the future . I like painting a picture of the future , but it 's always easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me , as we alternate between baseball and GMOs during this annual rite of spring . // I joke that in my mind , it 's not really Opening Day , seeing as how Major League Baseball commenced its season in Japan five days earlier . Hoping to enhance the game 's global appeal , baseball marketers dispatched the Chicago Cubs and the New York Mets to perform the Opening Day ritual on foreign soil . To dedicated fans , this was heresy . But tinkering with baseball is inconsequential compared to the bold drive by corporate science to reorder the world 's food system . At the moment , they are succeeding , albeit neither as swiftly nor as stealthily as they had hoped . // Fans watching Major League Baseball open its 2000 season at the Tokyo Dome ate snacks that contained GMOs . If they dipped their sushi , they undoubtedly consumed soy sauce from genetically modified soybeans grown in the United States . In China , hundreds of thousands of cotton farmers had sown modified seeds the season before , and the government also had commercialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to its engineered tobacco . In Argentina , the vast majority of seventeen million acres of soybeans were genetically engineered . In 1999 , three new countries  --  Portugal , Rumania , and Ukraine  --  planted engineered crops commercially for the first time , bringing to an even dozen the countries of the world where they legally sprout . Even Europeans , who by and large spurn the technology , were , whether they like it or not , eating food processed with genetically engineered soybeans. // When it comes to transformation of food , Americans lead by example . Ball Park Franks , a brand of hot dogs , was one of many foods found to contain genetically modified ingredients in tests sponsored by Consumer Reports , the magazine , and advocacy groups . As Gene had suggested , genetic engineering is as American as the national pastime . // North Americans are eating genetically modified foods regularly , but they do n't know which ones because , unlike Europe , Japan , and Australia , the governments of the United States and Canada do n't require labeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Americans are unaware of how deeply the technology has already reached into their cupboards . Tests by the consumer groups also showed altered DNA in breakfast cereals ; corn and tortilla chips ; granola bars ; cake and muffin mix ; corn meal ; diet drinks ; dog food ; soy burgers ; powdered chocolate drink ; and taco shells . The new modified diet starts young ; GMOs were found in three types of baby food . // GMOs are drunk as well as eaten . At Camden Yards , Gene reminds me that cola and soft drinks contain high-fructose syrup made from bulk corn that is likely to have engineered hybrids mixed in . Dairy farmers are using a genetically engineered hormone that induces cows to give more milk . Modified milk blends in the general supply of the beverage that 's hired wholesome hero Cal Ripken as its poster boy . Next , barley breeders intend to use genetically engineered varieties in beer . Scanning the patchwork of reds , yellows , and Oriole orange worn by fans in the rows in front of us , Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton from genetically engineered plants . // Our genetically engineered food is new , so new that on September 6 , 1995 , the day that Ripken surpassed Lou Gehrig 's " Iron Man " record of 2,130 consecutive games , gene-altered corn and soybeans had not yet been planted commercially . They were sprouting in American fields for the first time the following spring , when Ripken broke Japanese third baseman Sachio Kinugasa 's world record of 2,216 games . // GENETIC ERA DAWNS // On October 19 , 1992 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved Petition No. 92-196-01P , which allowed Calgene Incorporated to proceed with commercializing its Flavr Savr Tomato . Two years later , Flavr Savr became the first genetically engineered product to reach U.S. supermarkets . By then , China was already producing tomatoes and tobacco , after having sown its first commercial crop in 1992 , a transgenic tobacco resistant to the cucumber mosaic virus , on approximately one hundred acres . Two years later , Chinese scientists had engineered a second gene into tobacco to ward off tobacco mosaic virus . // By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations of Calgene 's invention , in which a gene was inserted backwards to slow the speed at which tomatoes softened as they ripened . The manipulation was supposed to remedy the tastelessness of tomatoes picked long before they 're sold . Unfortunately for the genetic engineers , the Flavr Savr tomato was as short on consumer appeal as on vowels . What we grow in our gardens remains the standard for comparison , and even gene wizards could n't produce a tomato that good . // The first truly revolutionary crop genetically engineered in the United States , a Monsanto Company soybean , won the government 's blessing on May 19 , 1994 , ushering in a series of government approvals for corn , potatoes , more tomatoes , cotton , squash , papaya , and , oddly , radicchio . In 1996 , the first year GMO crops were grown commercially , American farmers planted 3.6 million acres , surpassing China . In Canada that year , farmers planted about 300,000 acres with an herbicide-tolerant canola . Argentina , Mexico , and Australia had also begun cultivating a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops proliferate as in the United States . // By the time the new century arrived , the American government had approved more than fifty bioengineered crops . In 2000 in the United States , soybeans , corn , potatoes , and cotton were cultivated on seventy-five million acres of the 109.2 million planted globally . Never before had the worldwide acreage exceeded one hundred million , a landmass twice the size of the United Kingdom . The vast majority of these crops had genes inserted for two traits : herbicide tolerance , which enables plants to withstand sprayings of proprietary herbicides , primarily Monsanto-created Roundup formulations ; and insect resistance , which equips plants with the gene of a bacterium , Bacillus thuringiensis , so that they produce a protein that is fatal to pests . // Already , thousands of processed foods around the world contain genetically modified ingredients , most often modified soybeans . In the vision of the life-science companies , that is just the beginning . The seed catalogue of modified foods tested in the United States is thick indeed . In thousands of experiments during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted tests engineering new traits into wheat , rice , canola , melons , squash , cucumbers , strawberries , and sugarcane . Into apples , coffee , cranberries , eggplant , oats , onions , peas , pineapples , plums , raspberries , sweet potatoes , walnuts , and watermelons . Science is marching us toward a new gene smorgasbord , with many foods seasoned with DNA that has never before existed in the supply of human food . // It does n't stop with food . Modified tobacco has been tested outdoors , and experiments have been conducted manipulating the DNA of creeping bentgrass , Kentucky bluegrass , the American chestnut , spruce trees , sweet-gums , geraniums , gladiola , and the Texas gourd . Once approved by the Agriculture Department , these outdoor tests proliferated . In 1987 , there were just five of these field-test sites approved .
