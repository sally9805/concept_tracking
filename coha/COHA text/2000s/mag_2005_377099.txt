Everyone knows it 's not cool to drink and drive , but rounding up a designated driver can be a drag . Now it 's becoming surprisingly hip to hand over your keys to a stranger on a scooter . On New Year 's Eve , for instance , some 350 Coloradans caught a lift with NightRiders , a designated-driver service that safely deposits the inebriated  --  along with their cars  --  back home after a big night out . The company , like others popping up across the country , relies on collapsible scooters small enough to fit into a backseat or trunk to get its employees from one customer pickup to the next . CityScoot in Louisville , Ky. , offers prepaid cards and a catchy phone number ( 56-NO-DUI ) . Home James , a ritzy service in Los Angeles that features drivers in mod suits with fake British accents , has even won that ultimate stamp of media-age approval : a reality-TV-show pilot . <P> NightRiders , founded three years ago by a trio of college seniors in Boulder , initially aimed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its clientele among an older crowd . With a VIP service that includes discounts on drinks , the company , which expanded into Denver in September and plans to move into at least five other cities this year , is endorsed by the Colorado State Patrol and sponsored by the likes of local beer Goliath Coors , which agreed to pay the first $20 of every ride on New Year 's . But NightRiders ' most effective marketing tool is a poster comparing its fees  --  a $15 flat rate plus $2 a mile  --  with the price of a single DUI conviction , which can run up to $8,866 in Colorado when fines , legal fees and auto-insurance penalties are included . " The sad fact of it is , " says NightRiders co-founder Brad Dickerhofe , " people are more concerned about being busted than about putting lives at risk .
