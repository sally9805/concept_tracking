" The Diamond Pit " gave us one look at the Roaring Twenties in this issue . Now Robert Thurston gives us a very different take at that particular period of time , and at the nature of time in general . Mr. Thurston notes that his reading habits were formed largely by the book collections of both his grandfathers , which probably explains some of the impetus for this time-travel tale . Are n't the worlds of our ancestors wonderfully alien and distant ... and yet completely tangible ? <p> I AM THINKING OF AN OLD man and I am old now myself , not as decrepit-old as he was , but now I know the pathway to get there . I met him first in my kind of dark smoky tavern , timeless . I met his younger version soon after . In fact , it was not long after I met him the second time that I retired from the time-recording service . The first time his age , I figured , had to be close to ninety or even one hundred , maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ugliest dogs I 'd ever seen . I always hated dogs . When I was about two years old , my step-grandmother 's dog , a tiny hairy sort of mutt , chased me around a narrow side-yard next to the house where most of the family lived in small apartments and it nipped and bit me to its heart 's content . I was terrified , a terror that received little sympathy , especially from my step  --  grandmother , an ancient looking tall old lady who wore Franklin Roosevelt glasses and long-skirted heavy nineteenth-century dresses , usually dark and somber if not a bit Dickensian . She did not like me and maybe disliked all children . The dog bites were never the dog 's fault . I hated her . She died when I was still pretty young and it was the first death of my lifetime that I did not mourn . This dog in the bar , a tiny dog past its prime with a real old-dog smell , reminded me immediately of my step-grandmother 's dog , especially when he took my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lapping up beer in a cracked bowl when he took my hand instead , as I reached out to pay the bartender . In spite of my fear of dogs , I saw right away that this one had no intention of actually biting me . Its owner , whose face I had not yet seen , muttered boozily and incoherently . " Says the dog wo n't bite you , " the owner 's companion said . The companion was a short pudgy man who stood on the lowest rung of his barstool and leaned toward me , inserting his head between the owner and the dog 's . His face was close to mine and his breath smelled like an ancient carton in an alley . Smiling insincerely down at the dog ( my hand still in its harmless mouth ) , I took my change from the bartender with my free hand . I tried to gentle my hand out of the dog 's mouth . It increased its dental pressure slightly . Gum pressure really  --  I could feel only a couple of blunt teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unintelligible . The bartender , a man who apparently cared little about drinkers or dogs , nudged my drink toward me . " Said the dog never bit nobody , " the owner 's interpreter said . " Nobody except a cop once or twice . " " My brother 's a cop , " I said . My brother had actually been forcibly retired from the force a few years before for brutality beyond the call of duty . He never explained and became instead a security guard . " Oh . Maybe the mutt wants to bite you out of , oh , what you call it , some sort of guilt . " " Guilt by association . " The pudgy man laughed and sat back . His left foot slid off the continued to enjoy my hand . Its owner mumbled again and pushed the animal 's beer glass a half-inch toward him . The dog 's peripheral vision clicked on . He let go my hand and returned to lapping up beer . I held up my hand and wiggled my fingers , happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arm , the way older men sometimes do , and mumbled . Of course I could not understand what he said . His face seemed oddly curved , and his prim tiny mouth did not jibe with his flat bulgy nose . He was nearly bald , a few fragile strands of faded yellow hair across the top of his brittle scalp . He looked ancient , Shangri-La ancient . I could hardly see his eyes because of all the intruding age around them . " Says you 're very good around dogs , " his friend said before sipping at his fresh glass of beer . I picked up my drink , a gin and tonic , and took a hefty swallow . The man 's interpreter nodded toward him and said , " He was the world 's champ in nineteen twenty-something . " Actually , he did not say nineteen twenty-something . He gave the exact year . I just do n't remember it now . " Really , " I said . " That 's nice . " I searched for the champ 's hidden eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Before he could mumble his answer , his interpreter leaped into the breech : " Light heavyweight . Light heavy champ in nineteen twenty  --  something . Beat somebody with a Slavic sort of surname . " He did not , of course , say somebody with a Slavic sort of surname . Sports fans always know the exact names and dates . I just ca n't remember the name he said . I 'm not good with names . Or dates . Facts and time confuse me . My profession , I guess . " Light heavy , huh ? " I said . " I 'm not much up on boxing these days  --  " " Who said anything about these days ? I just said nineteen twenty  --  something . " " Well , I was n't born then . " " Can see that . Not goddamn potted , y'know . When were you born ? " " Nineteen forty-something . " " Remember that year . Boxer with an Irish surname fought a Negro who was a credit to his race that year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thanks . I work out three days a week . When I was a kid , I knew more about boxing . Watched Friday night fights on the TV . Name Pete Rademacher mean anything to you ? " " Familiar . Do n't recall . " " Ingemar Johanson ? " " Sure . Fought Patterson or somebody . " " Believe he did . The champ was champ in the twenties , huh ? " " Yep . For thirteen and a half months . " " My grandfather was a fight promoter back in the twenties . I do n't know if he was in nineteen twenty-something or not , probably was . He promoted a lot of fights around that time . Owned an auditorium where - " " Oh , yeah ? I was all over the map then . I 'm only a few years younger than the champ myself . Do n't look it , right ? " Mentally I shrugged , but I said , " You do n't look so old . " " Right . I followed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellas in the fight game . What was your granddad 's name ? Maybe I heard of him . " My grandfather 's name did n't mean anything to him . He shook his head . " Do n't recall . There was a magician - " " Know all about the magician . " " You related ? " " In some distant way , my father told me . " " Hear that , champ ? You used to know the magician , right ? " Champ mumbled . " Says he met him on the show circuit . Champ was doing his jump and exercise act . Appeared in skits , too . Greatest showbiz boxer in vaudeville since James J. Corbett , the ads said . Should have seen him jump rope . Real good at it . Made Sugar Ray , the original Sugar Ray , look like a street kid . " " I 'll bet . " There was something like a smile on the champ 's face . I wanted to cry . He looked so old . His blue serge suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of person younger people laughed at . " Champ 'd like to know if you know of any fights your grandpa promoted . " " Gee , sorry . Some pretty big names came to town , but - " " Any name at all ? " " Jimmy Riley , but he was a local guy . Pretty good , I guess . " " Jimmy Riley , yeah , I heard of him . Good little old boy . Used to get in the center of the ring and mix it up . " " Might be . Before my time . " Last I ever saw of Jimmy Riley , he was an old man whose whole face had been cauliflowered , much worse than the damage on the champ 's face . I always thought that , under his cheap but always well-starched clothes , Jimmy Riley must have a cauliflowered body . He was like the champ by then , never said anything anybody could understand . He had to use a tubed metal walker to get around town , clomping it down before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hello to him , he smiled even more . He 's been dead a long time . He was probably not as old as he had seemed to me . Maybe the champ , with that pastry-dough face of his , was younger than he looked , too . " Any other names ? " the pudgy interpreter said . " Champ likes to hear names . Remembers good when he hears names . " " No . Sorry . " " That 's okay . Nobody 's around from those days , " cepting us . " He settled back on his barstool , his feet locked into a rung . " You remember any names , you just shout them out , hear ? " " Sure . " The champ nodded in agreement . I took my drink to a table and brooded there for a time . Almost too long a time . I glanced down at my watch and realized I had to be someplace . It was time to escape . CATCH THE TRAIN to memory lane . A trolley , actually . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment tends to crowd the rest of us , the ride into town is comfortable . The trolley smells of new paint . Red , gold , and white paint . Men wear boaters and get along jolly well with each other . Women wear plain fabrics in colorful designs . Not a flapper in the bunch . Flappers are in big cities . Look for them to come to town with the out-of-town fighters , the big spenders , and the butter and egg men . Watch for them hanging off pinstripes . I decide to be genial with the man next to me . " Goin " to the fights ? " He pushes up the brim of his derby to see me better . He has rural eyes . Intense , colorless , distant . They make me realize how much of a city boy I am . " I am a Baptist , son . " " Yes ? " " A Baptist . " " And Baptists do n't usually go to fights , that it ? " " Baptists do not generally speak to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten how severe you Baptist folk are . " " Godliness is not severity , son . " " Whatever you say . Well , hang in there . " He looks at me strangely . In the past small-town people usually do n't comment on anachronistic slang . They think it is just big city talk . Unless , of course , they are in the big city , in which circumstances they think it is just hick lingo . The Baptist resumes his straightbacked , forward-staring position . He seems out of place , with me sitting on one side of him , a fat man telling Pat and Mike jokes on the other side , a barbershop quartet practicing quietly across the aisle . After I return from the past , I forget a lot of what you might call period detail . I want the Baptist to be cheerful . I should , after all , be able to make him cheerful . " Well , God 's in his heaven , all right , " I say , and he glowers at me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it make you proud to be a Baptist ? " " Son , we are passing the chemical plant , and the air is not what I would call pleasant . I would call that a stench . " He sniffs distastefully , as if he 's borrowed God 's nostrils . I take a deep breath . There is a mild chemical aroma in the air , a trace . " Why , sir , this is nothing . Compared to what I am used to , this is fresh air . " " You must be used to the sulfurous fumes of Hell . " " No , just New Jersey . " I can say anything I want when I am in the past . It is rare for anyone there to even question me . The Baptist returns to ignoring me . I tell my crew to gather their equipment and prepare to disembark . Nearby men and women , clearly interested in all the cameras and electronic paraphernalia that do not exist in their time , pass joking remarks among themselves . We try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camcorders inside Brownie camera boxes and planting a lot of tech stuff in old peeling suitcases , but still the sheer amount of it is noticeable and worth being puzzled over . My crew are their usual passive selves . My chief electrician allows himself a polite smile as he gently lifts a child 's hand away from his stuff . We have almost arrived at the Coliseum . I can see from my seat without having to stretch my body for the view . It is a fat building with Turkish-style domes atop a complicated brick structure . The domes and brick do not go well together . That , I suppose , is the glory of America , especially here in the past . The trolley comes to a smooth halt in front of the Coliseum , and all passengers are discharged . It is early . The boxing card will not begin for a while . Still , people are already milling around the entrance gates , talking easily among themselves , without the anxiety that waiting lines in my day often display . These people are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . It is a good feeling , and I stop to enjoy it . My crew spreads to each side of me , a double phalanx awaiting my command to attack . That is not even a correct image . My crew would attack nobody . They would not risk their equipment . I wonder if we should shoot some covering footage , but it is a while before anything will start , so I decide not to . I tell my cameraman ( once I knew all their names ) to scout locations . My chief electrician asks what 's this gig all about ? I 'm not sure , I said , it 's something to do with some writer-geek who 's making too much money wanting some period research about boxing for a TV program , maybe documentary , maybe not . I do not tell him why I chose to come to this place to do the research. - He gives me a head-tossing nod and deploys the crew properly . I wander around , taking in sights . When I am in the past , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see no longer exists , has turned to dust . I have a picture of my mother in a waitress uniform , from a slightly later time ( she was only about twelve or thirteen at this time and not likely to be anywhere near a boxing match ) , standing by a table in my grandfather 's restaurant and smiling as if there would be no tragedy in her future . And when I look at the photo , I feel that there will be no tragedy in my past . " Boxing is evil , " says a voice behind me , " two grown men beating each other 's brains out . " I turn around , fully expecting to confront another stem Baptist . Instead , I have to look down at a small , compact , and rather pretty woman who was somewhere my side of thirty . She is wearing a faded-pattern , somewhat frayed dress which looks like it belongs to another era - I mean a different one from the time we were in . Forward in time . The Depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother 's mother . That would , of course , be too much of a coincidence . Anyway , in the twenties my mother lived with her mother in South Bend , Indiana . She does not come from here to Indiana and go to the right church strawberry social at the right time and meet my father for some years yet . " Boxing should be outlawed . Politicians should close it down , not profit from it . Blood and meanness , that 's what it is . I swear I do n't know why I love it so much . " I like her hair . It is a bit unkempt . Combed loosely , down from a middle part . Several strands of gray among the black . Pre-hippie hippie . " My name is Alexandria Versailles . What 's yours ? " I tell her my name . " Then you are related to the promoter of this pugilistical engagement ? " " This what ? " " This exhibition of fisticuffs . " She points to a poster listing the night 's card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the promoter . " He is , well , a relative of mine . Distant . Quite distant , actually . " " An evil man , to prey on bloodthirsty inclinations . Are you also related to the magician ? " " Even more distantly . " " He is a very good magician . But I do not approve of magic . It appeals to my voracious hunger for fantasy . " " But you go to magic shows ? " " Often . " She smiles , obviously pleased I 'd gotten her number so quickly . " Is your name really Alexandria Versailles ? " " This week . " " And last week ? " " I do n't remember . " " I 'm sure the promoter of these matches does not consider boxing evil . " " No , he sees it as competition . Read Sinclair Lewis . Businessmen in various enterprises generally see competition as a virtue and an ideal . " " But you find it neither . " " Since I do n't compete , I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , said you do n't approve of magic shows , also a judgment . " " The difference is in whether you see them from my point of view , young man . I 've been hit , I 've felt pain , I can judge boxing . I 've withdrawn almost totally into fantasy , I can judge magic shows . But I have not competed , so I wo n't judge competition . " " Not competed ? Not in school ? Not in the general run of things ? " " Not in any way I choose to see as competition . " " And , anyway , you lie from time to time . " " That 's so , young man , though it is impolitic of you to say so . " A couple of men , obvious sports in their bright outfits and tilted boaters , look over at Alexandria and me . One of them holds a white-gloved hand over his mouth . The other nods and smiles a mean smile . I feel they are talking about us , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly takes the white glove away from his face . The listener straightens out his smile . " You found something about me funny ? " I say to the talker . " Well , no . " " You found something about us funny ? " " Not you , bud . Just her , the woman , she 's the - " " You will die , both of you , " I say and return to Alexandria , who asks what I 'd said to get such wrathful reactions from the men , who were still standing together , staring at us . I tell her . " What good did that do ? " " Introduced an unpleasant idea to their fun . " " And they 'll have to think about it for a while . " " Right . " " And maybe even examine the worth of their lives . " " You do this , too ? " " No , but I think I 'll try it sometime . " " If you really dislike the person , tell him that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a tad too cruel . You are an unpleasant young man , in some ways . " " Not young . Not young at all . I look younger than I am . " As I stroll around , searching for local color , Alexandria accompanies me . Inside the building workers are in the final stages of setting up chairs . Groups of eight or nine chairs are attached together as a unit and each unit can be set up quickly by two workers . When not in use for an audience , these chairs are folded up and stacked against a wall . The arena itself is not especially large , nor does it have much slope to the floor . People in back rows would simply not see as well as those in front . The boxing ring is set up in a stage area at one end , instead of in the middle as in most boxing auditoriums . The favored chairs , the expensive ones , are on the stage and arranged around the ring . The rabble , of course , sits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an audience for boxing . Black velvet curtains are being strapped back by another set of laborers . When the place is not used for boxing , it houses vaudeville , touring stage shows , some special movies . My grandfather has another building , downtown , for regular movies . It started as a storefront nickelodeon , and he turned it into a movie palace . Nobody pays much attention to Alexandria and me as we head toward the stage . There is sawdust on the floor , and my foot slides on little patches of it . Before we reach the stairs to the stage , my attention is diverted by a large drawing that hangs on a wall by an exit door . It depicts , in rather primitive fashion , a big man standing stiffly and flexing his arm muscles . The man 's legs are shorter than his torso , which seems too massive , even for a bodybuilder . The figure is dressed only in a pair of trunks . Crude squiggly hair has been drawn on top of the round head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if ill-sketched , features on his face . Next to the man 's wide calf is the signature , " Garibaldi . " The letters are widely spaced , the loops large , and dots on the i 's circular . " Everybody stops at that , " Alexandria comments . " What is it ? " " Self-portrait of Garibaldi the wrestler . He was here for a bout once , which he won . Afterward , he leaped out of the ring and drew this - I suspect to show that his artistic prowess was on the same level as his wrestling skills , or so he thought anyway . It 's said that he makes the same drawing of himself every place he has a bout . Those he wins , anyway . I do n't know if he 's actively .. competing anymore . That drawing was made , oh , years ago . Before the Great War , I think . " As we go up the stairs to the stage , a figure comes out of the wings and begins to inspect the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His body sends out rays of barely restrained energy . His movements are quick , a bit edgy . He might look like one of the boxers if the streak of white in his thinning , brushed-back hair did not suggest he was too old . He inspects the ring in the manner of a man who is expert at what he does and yet has a thousand other things to attend to , some unrelated to the task at hand . Alexandria whispers his name to me , but that is n't necessary . I 'd recognize my grandfather anywhere . He is even wearing a striped suit that I dimly recall from a photograph . The suit fascinates me because I 've always pictured it as photo-album gray , when in fact it is a rich and deep brown . It looks just right on him , as clothing usually does on a man with a strong personality . I suppose that his possessions become infused with his identity , even subsumed by it . Even though he is staring down at canvas and running his hands along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our presence . When he has satisfied himself about the ring 's condition , he looks immediately at me , his gaze direct . His eyes , deepset , examine me as if he recognizes me . I am more conscious now of the precision of his avian facial features . The nose has a piercing sharpness to it , the chin is an aggressive knife-point . When I did know him years later , I was a child and his face had aged a great deal , the hairline receded further , the angularity eroded over the years . But seeing him healthy is the big thrill now . I had known him as an asthmatic who spent most of his time in bed . I remember him talking in a wheeze , so when he addressed me now I am startled by the power of his voice . " Do you belong here , sir ? " " Yes , I do , I am - " " All right . I believe you . Hello , Alexandria . " It is a rich voice , resonant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she whispers to me : " He likes me to call him Hank . I 'm the only one he lets . It 's a , well , conditional privilege . " He puts one foot on the second lowest step of the set of stairs leading up to the boxing ring , with his hand on his knee , leaning on the hand a little , and he talks to me as if we are old friends : " What I want to tell you is , I need a man of about your weight to fight the first prelim . Tanktown bum did n't show up . Last I heard he 's soused up somewhere in some Polack North Buffalo tavern , and I do n't expect to see the bastard tonight at all . " It is a bit of a shock to hear my grandfather , who became so straitlaced in his old age , say bastard and Polack . " What about it , young man ? " " Jesus , I do n't think I - I mean , my age alone 'd - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forty-something . " " I was still strapping on the gloves at forty-seven . So was Bob Fitzsimmons , or was it Corbett , do n't remember . Look , I can see you 're not a fighter , you got outdoor skin , but you could pass . Pretty good build . You look young enough , mid-thirties even . And your opponent - well , he 's seen better days himself , bud . He might be nearer fifty than you are , maybe past . I 'm afraid to put a real brawler in with him , might kill him . You last a round or two , that 's all I ask , and it 's worth fifty smackeroos to me , cash on the line , and you 're the right weight , and all I got 's a ringer and I ca n't bring in a ringer , not with this crowd , a lot of betting moolah in this crowd . Anyway , my wife could take this bum , your opponent , with one powder puff tied behind her back . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childbirth , with my aunt . ) My mind collapses for a moment as I listen to his fast patter . I never heard him talk fast or use words like smackeroo and moolah . I was having a hard time with the new slant on my grandmother , who in faded pictures always looked gentle and delicate , with no punch at all . " C'm on , I can tell you can do it , ca n't he , Alexandria ? " I did not look at her , not wanting to see any encouragement from her . " Not many guys in your condition , bud . " " I work out . Take vitamins . " " What good 's vitamins ? " " Oh , just a theory they 're good . Comes from , oh , the Midwest , I think . " " What do those crackers know ? " " I play racquetball . " " Never heard of it . " " A game . I play tennis , too . But I never boxed , and I think it takes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly - I value my life . " " Do n't blame you there . But you can do it . You got good blood , I can tell . " Your blood , I almost say . But I am too tempted to play the role he has assigned me . Downstage , one of my crew was setting up the generator for his equipment ( we rarely use power from the time we visit ) . He has been listening , and he nods toward me , as if he would be pleased to see me get mauled in the ring and would see to it that every moment was recorded on tape . The idea of fighting is ridiculous , of course . No amateur ever fights at my age . I am , as I told Hank , forty-something . My father was nearly forty when he sired me , the last of his rather large brood . I can see , though , how Hank could have been mistaken . I did n't get the family curse . I do not look older than my years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since my divorce , I have had no trouble dating women in their twenties , women who are twenty-something and take me as not much older than they . Numbers fascinate me . But , youthful demeanor aside , I am sure I do not look like someone who could handle himself in a ring . Is my grandfather ( with those strong knowing eyes ) playing some elaborate joke on me ? " I 'll do it , " I say , and I find out there is no elaborate joke . He gives me " boxing gloves , red trunks with a white stripe , a gray tanktop , and tells me I got the afternoon to get in shape . He sends a guy named Jimmy to help me out . I have jumped rope for at least fifteen minutes , in a dim but spacious backstage room , and am on the verge of collapse , when I finally recognize that Jimmy is Jimmy Riley , the fellow who used to go around my town in the walker when I was a kid . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " me , right ? You reckanize me . " " ' Course I do . Just making conversation . " " I went eight rounds with Benny Leonard last year . " " Good for you . " " He says I can fight him again . Enjoyed my moves , he said . " " Do n't you worry about getting hurt , fighting guys like Benny Leonard ? " " What you mean ? It 's worth it . I like fightin ' . I 'm a scrapper since day one . " " But what about the future ? " " What about it ? You do what you can now , that 's what my pop told me . He died broke , so 'll I. " So 'll you . " But your family , your children .... " " They got to take care o " themselves . " " But you could damage your brain , wind up going around in a daze . " " Ah , get outta here . You want to spar with someone ? " " What good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save that for tonight . " " Geez , the things you guys 'll do for twenty bucks . I swear I do n't know how Henry F. talks people into it . He 's doin " it all the time , saves hisself a bundle . He should get a string o " clubfighters " n " let you bastards alone . Hold your left up higher , will you ? My great-aunt Sally could floor you , you hold your gloves like that . Let me show you . " Alexandria , who left for a while , has come back . She watches me with some concern in her eyes . She did n't want me to take this fight , I can tell . She does n't understand this is my grandfather I 'm fighting for . I never had a chance to do anything like that . I have to do it . For the hour before the fight bill begins I wander around the auditorium . I wonder where my father is . At first I think it might be the young man spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows with a garden rake . But , no , the boy is too young . The time comes for the fight . My crew is now in their places , their pair of disguised cameras directed toward the ring , their equipment forcing the removal of a couple of front rows on one side , displacing some irked customers . Henry reseats most of them , getting the young boy who 'd been spreading sawdust to squeeze a lot of folding chairs together to create some extra seating . I am introduced to the crowd under a fake name that I had n't been warned about . A number of fans seem to think I look like a bum . Fortunately , it is the first bout of the evening , and there is only a small audience . The ring announcer says I have a string of victories out west . I hold up my gloved hands and do one of those little dances I 've seen in boxing movies . The dance is sort of like the Mashed Potato with boxing gloves . Some people like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my opponent , comes into the ring . He does n't look like a bum to me . He 's been around , sure , I can tell that , and the age in his face suggests he might even be as old as Henry says he is , but his mouth is mean and there is a hunger in his eyes that nobody should have . When the fight starts , he pulls me into a clinch and tells me to tank it near the end of the second round . I am perfectly willing to oblige him and take the dive at that time . I just do n't think I can last that long . His powder-puff punches put me in a daze that begins in the first minute of the first round . I do n't know how that round ends with me on my feet . There is a pain in the hinges of my jaw whose origin I can not recall . I remember I threw a couple of blows myself , and the bum has to move into them to make them look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my comer . I feel Jimmy Riley , who is acting as my second since he has no bout scheduled on the night 's card , poke and tug at my face . There is a sting from some salve he dabs on my cuts . " You 're not very convincing , " Alexandria Versailles says . I do n't know where she came from . " Hi , Jimmy . " " Hi , Lexy . " " One of your kids is hustling change outside . " " I 'll give him a good clip when this 's over . " " That wo n't be long . " The bum guides me around the ring in the second round , and I managed to be knocked out at the right time . After the count , the bum pulls me up and says I did okay and thanks he needed the green , which he wouldn't 've got if the fight had been canceled . Henry do n't dole out the dough , he says , unless the match goes on . In the locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip his kid . I hear the crowd cheering . The next fight is evidently better than mine . I do n't care much . My face feels swollen and is throbbing with pain . Alexandria comes in . " See ? " she says . " Boxing is evil . I loved seeing you knocked about . Some of the crowd liked you . That uppercut you landed in the first round was - " " What uppercut I landed ? " " You do n't remember ? What a pity . It looked pretty good . Your friends with the cameras and junk loved it . The only convincing moment . Good thing there was no betting action . Somebody might cream you in an alley . I think everybody in the auditorium knew it was a tank job . " " Why 'd he bother letting it go on then ? " " Henry promises a full card , he gives the crowd a full card . Besides , your opponent 's one of Henry 's charities . " " Yeah , he told me , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a bit shocked . He enters with an entourage . A lot of people who ca n't help touching him . He wears a bright blue robe that looks silken , expensive . I recognize this guy right away . He 's the guy from the bar . The features of his face still in place , a jaunty bounce to his walk , an alertness in his eyes , the primness of his mouth even more pronounced , but still the champ , the light heavyweight champion back in nineteen twenty-something . And of course this is nineteen twenty-something . It might even be that particular nineteen twenty-something . It is quite possible I am here because I met him there . Often it happens that way . He glances over at me , seems to recognize me . " Hey , fellow , " he says . His diction is precise , surprisingly so for a man who could only be understood by his pudgy friend when I last met him . I sit up straight , happy to be addressed . " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get out of the business . " Everybody around him laughs , even the silken expensive lady . A couple in the entourage look scornfully at me , including again the lady . The present , soon-to-be or exlight heavyweight champion walks over to me and whispers , " You got no talent . Get out of this . Find a nice kind of life . This ai n't worth it . You go in the tank , you stay in the tank . See my point ? " " Yes , sir . " He cuffs me with a surprising gentleness . I see so much life in his eyes . I wonder how long it will last . How long will it be before it goes , and he still has decades of life to go ? He goes back to the entourage and I find a dark place to get dressed . Alexandria waits for me outside the locker room , and we find seats in the back of the auditorium . Henry joins us and offers me the twenty bucks . I refuse it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't need the green . I got a job . That 's my crew up there , moving a lot around the ring . " He nods and looks toward the stage , at the ring where the boy is wiping off the canvas with a large towel . " I wondered about them , " Henry says . " They seemed to know what they were doing . I wanted to stop them , but found I could n't . " " Nope . When we show up , you have to accept us . " " Why 's that ? " " We come from another time . " " You know , I suspected that . " " So did I , " Alexandria interjects . " I spot people from other times all the time . I 'm good at it . " " You 're supposed to be impressed , " I say . " I 'm not supposed to discuss this with you , but my brain 's been knocked around tonight and I 'm kind of addled . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I believe in all possibilities . Anything I want to do I can do . And I will . That 's what 's so terrific about this country . So I guess even the fantastic is possible . I mean , what the hell , y'know ? " I could tell him about the licks the American dream will be taking later in the century , but why take the light out of his eyes ? And anyway I 'll remove most of this conversation through post-hypnotic suggestion before I leave . I say : " Yeah , what the hell . " " Sure you do n't want the double sawbuck ? " " Give it to a charity . " " Nah . I 'll keep it . " " Suit yourself . Where 's your son ? Where 's Don ? " He narrows his eyes . The narrowing makes his birdlike nose wrinkle , and it looks like it belongs on a different kind of bird . But he answers me : " On a trip . Down to Cuba . You interested in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am stunned . My father never told me he took a trip to Cuba back in the twenties . I wish I could have asked him about it . " No , he 's not the reason . It 's just a job . Hey , this guy , he 's good , right ? " I point up at the ring where the once , now , or future light-heavy champ is entering the ring . " Oh ? " Henry says . " The guy is good , give him that , but he drops his left too much . Other boxers take advantage . Somebody 'll cream him someday , then another guy 'll cream him , and it 'll go on until whatever happens , happens . " " That 's what I 've decided about life , " I say . " It goes on until whatever happens , happens . " " Sounds pretty stupid to me . " Somehow I do n't mind being chided by Henry . I like him so much I 've stopped thinking of him as my grandfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really good . He comes out of the corner like a bulldog attacking an intruder , his arms flailing , his body bent forward , eager to start mixing it up , his whole being focused on mutilating the other guy . His opponent proves too mutilatable . It is not a long fight . It only lasts a round . But it is a round that brings the fight fans to their feet , cheering , including me and Alexandria . Even Henry . I look over at Henry and see the glow of excitement , the pleasure of a good show , in his eyes . That look is costly . I miss nearly half the fight with my glance at him . I look back to see my guy deliver a series of jabs , sharp and rhythmic like a woodpecker attacking tree bark . He follows them with an abrupt right cross , then a gentle push with his left glove that decks the other guy . At the end of the count , my guy just nods to the hysterical crowd and returns to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before he comes to . He leaves the ring meekly . When my guy comes up the aisle and reaches the last row , he recognizes me and he mouths the words , " Get out , " then smiles warmly . There is , as they say in the fight biz , not a mark on him . I hang around for a long while . I see my guy leave , the silken expensive woman on his arm , the entourage doing entourage things . Alexandria stays with me for a while and watches while I chat with the camera crew about the footage they obtained . My stage manager says they did n't get much that was usable . The main event , brief as it was , would have some value for the company archives , even if the client did n't want it , but there was little to build much of a program around . He says my bout would make for a comic interlude but of course they would not , could not , use it . After they pack up , Alexandria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , " but I have to go now . " " Where are you going ? " " To where I came from . " " And where is that ? " She smiles oddly . " That , my dear boy , is for me to know and you to ... to not know . So long . " She strolls out of the auditorium without looking back at me . I think of what an odd bird she is , and how many odd birds I meet on my travels . I doubt she even belongs to this time . She might be an agent of my own time-recording service or even one of the competitors . Perhaps I have already realized that , and she has merely planted a post-hypnotic suggestion about odd birds . It 's what I 'd do . I look around for Henry . There are only a few people about , and he is not one of them . The boy is sweeping up the sawdust that I had watched him put down earlier . Every once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his pocket . I go over to him and ask him where Henry is . He says Henry by this time is checking out the bill down at his vaudeville house or packing up the film from the movie palace and putting it on the trolley where it will go on the beltline to Buffalo to be replaced by a new film . As we speak , the boy bends down , sifts through the sawdust , and comes up with something . He holds it up to the light . It is a coin . A half  --  dollar . God , how long has it been since I 've seen a half-dollar ? " I make a lot of dough sweeping up , " the boy says . " A lot of coins drop out of a lot of pockets , you know ? In the excitement , you know ? Don taught me that . " " Don ? " " Don . Henry 's son . He used to do this job . " Vaguely , I remember him telling me about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had at the nursing home . I think it was during one of the times he rambled on about some indefinite old times . I think I only half-listened , and I regret that . " Are you related to Don ? " I ask , hoping this might be one of my uncles . " Or to Henry ? " He laughs . " Nope . Wish I was . They got it made . " Some tears I do not expect come into my eyes . " Yeah , I suppose they have , " I say . I decide it 's time to go . Take the car back to the bar . Grab the trolley back to my folly . In the bar , the ex-light-heavy champ is gone , and so is the dog , although there is still an old-dog smell hanging in the air . The pal , the short pudgy man , is still there , having drunk so much his head is hanging down almost to the surface of the bar . His hand grips a half-empty glass . Or would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twists sideways . Recognizing me , he tries to say something . But he ca n't talk . The champ 's terrific , " I say , " so 's his dog . " That seems to satisfy him .
