Watch out , USC . Quietly , steadily , KARL DORRELL is stocking UCLA with the talent to take back the city-and the Pac-10-from its crosstown rival . By Matt Hayes // Eddie is a janitor . Empties the trash , cleans the locker room . He means nothing to you yet everything to UCLA . " No one is more important here , " Karl Dorrell says . It 's Day 1 of another season , another opportunity for Dorrell , in his fourth year as coach , to pursue the monster that is Southern California and put his alma mater back on the college football map . The first full team meeting of the season is the longest-and most important-these players will sit through the entire year . Dorrell is talking about character and respect . No one , he says , is better than anyone else . No player , no janitor . He is preaching , and they are catatonic , and he then does something he never has done before . " Everyone stand up , " he says . And now everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tevaga breathe . " Words are powerful , " Dorrell says . " There 's one word that is a problem on a lot of football teams . That word is the most vulgar , hostile form of contempt in the English language . " Nigger . There 's no easy way to say it . Or read it . It 's disgusting , it 's vile , and it 's part of Dorrell 's life-like it or not . Rising above it , steering clear of it , shaping who he is today . He is one of only five black head coaches in Division 1-A , a number nearly as offensive as the word itself . Now this meeting has become a sermon- " to our young brothers and our white players " - ol football and of life . Dorrell speaks of his parents , who once were forced to use segregated bathrooms . Of his father , a career Navy man . who had to explain to his youngest son why the family always drove at night in the South-then made sure Karl understood that everyone Is equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean anything . " Dorrell says , and they 're still standing at attention . " It 's not a word in a rap song . You have to understand the historical significance of it . That word can divide you , can tear a team apart . " This speech , this lesson , can bring his team together . This team is more talented than his previous three . Bigger and stronger and more , well , more like that school 's across town . This team is his team . For the first time since he arrived before the 2003 season , nearly every scholarship player Is one Dorrell recruited . There are seven fifth-year seniors who were recruited by the previous staff , seven players who have bought into and embraced Dorrell 's philosophy . This year 's freshmen , some of whom could have chosen that school across town , make up his best recruiting class yet . This team Is coming off a 10-wln season , something only six other teams In school history have accomplished . The staff believes quarterback Ben Olson. alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waiting , finally is ready to live up to his megarecruit hype . Remember mighty-mite tailback Maurice Jones-Drew ? Meet tailback Chris Markey , who. if he lost a couple of inches , would be Jones-Drew 's twin . The Interior lines are stronger and more experienced , and the Bruins have n't been this deep at wide receiver in years . " But if you do n't have chemistry , " Dorrell says , " Il you do n't have that brotherhood , you do n't have anything . " When Dorrell arrived at UClA the program was a wreck . Even worse , that school across town had just finished a season In which its quarterback had won the Heisman Trophy . And because he was n't Pete Carroll-because he was n't a teen with boundless energy trapped in a 50-somethlng body-and because he chooses words carefully and speaks in measured tones , he was seen as a coach in over his head . Especially after that first season , when the Bruins finished 6-7 and his time was spent weeding out malcontents instead of teaching . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss to a non-BCS team In a meaningless bowl game . Then came the e-mails , the hurtful , embarrassing and , yes . threatening e-mails . This is what happens when the guy across town recaptures the glory and the Bruins are losing to the Fresno States and Wyomlngs of the world . " If they could 've hanged me , " Dorrell says , " they would 've . " It 's 8 a.m. the following day in Los Angeles , about 12 hours after the Initial team meeting , and it 's Media Day at UCLA-an opportunity for the local media to talk to Dorrell before fall camp officially begins later in the afternoon . This is the nation 's second-largest television/media market , a booming metro of sports , entertainment and hedonism . And there are eight tired bodies waiting for Dorrell 's message-nine if you count the guy who called ahead and said he was stuck in traffic on the 405 . At that other school across town , things got so wild last year the publicity staff joked that each media event was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief Q and A session , Dorrell jokingly yells , " Wake up ! " as the back and forth wanes . The night before , he turned on an overhead projector and flashed the Pac-10 preseason media poll-the one that had UCLA behind USC , California , Oregon and Arizona State . He then placed the national coaches ' poll on the projector , ran down the list of 25 and snaked back and forth over the " also receiving votes " until his finger finally landed on UCLA . " An insult , " Olson says . There 's one way to get better in college football : get better players . When that school across town is like a black hole sucking up every five-star stud high schooler north of Tijuana , it makes it even tougher . Yet Dorrell is making recruiting inroads . It began a few years ago with guys such as safety Dennis Keyes , Jones-Drew and Tevaga , who grew up a USC fan but chose to play for UCLA because of Dorrell . Look , USC still is the king-not just of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming more than just a nuisance on the recruiting trail . UCLA has seven early commitments for 2007 , three of whom USC badly wanted , including defensive tackle Brian Price from Crenshaw High School , a Trojan stronghold a couple miles from USC 's campus . " Once you meet him , " Tevaga says of Dorrell , " you believe in him . " Three team pictures hang on the wall in Dorrell 's office , daily reminders of how far the program has to go . One of the top receivers in school history , Dorrell played on three Rose Bowl champions in 1982 , 1983 and 1985 . " Sometimes I 'll go in his office just to look at them , " wideout Junior Taylor says . " We 're close to adding another to that wall . " Considering where they were when Dorrell arrived , that 's a remarkable statement . That summer in 2003 , a mere 48 players showed up for UCLA 's offseason conditioning-less than half the roster . Three years later , Dorrell is finishing his first meeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent turnout in summer conditioning-rare in the college game these days . " You guys did your part , " Dorrell says . " It 's time for the coaches to do ours . " The first step was last winter , when Dorrell-unbeknownst to most-was pursued by the Chiefs and Raiders for head coaching jobs . The guy in over his head at UCLA had the NFL floating seven-figure dreams in front of him . Dorrell decided to stay put . " I 'm not here as the cleaner , " he says . " I will get a lot more satisfaction with my job when we 're able to turn this around and bring this program back where it should be . " Dorrell took another step toward returning UCLA to the nation 's elite this offseason by hiring respected NFL assistant DeWayne Walker away from the Redskins to coordinate a defense that ranked 106th in the nation in 2004 and 113th in 2005 . " They 're horrible on defense , " says one Pac-10 coach . " Look at those athletes ; I ca n't figure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where the hell they were half the time . " The answer is as simple as eliminating complicated coverages and ever-changing responsibilities , as simple as manning up and tackling someone . Walker will rely on what he has gleaned over the years as an assistant under a few guys who know what they 're doing : Redskins defensive coordinator Gregg Williams , Panthers coach John Fox and some dude named Carroll . Yep , Walker was part of Carroll 's first staff at USC , the team that lost six games and had finicky L.A. fans wondering whether Carroll was the right guy for the job . Walker also was part of Carroll 's New England Patriots staff in the late 1990s . That 's when he first met a young coach on his way up , a coach who interviewed for a spot on Carroll 's staff but did n't get it . Who knows what would have happened had Carroll hired Karl Dorrell that day . " You stay in this business long enough , and it all comes around , " Walker says . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . " The first meeting of Dorrell 's fourth season is complete . Fall camp is hours away . " The journey starts tomorrow , " he says . It started a long time ago . He walks out of the room and walks into Eddie , who just happens to be walking by . He puts his arm around him and walks away . No one is better than anyone else . It 's that exceptional moment when you find one who is . Sidebar The Bruins hope a lefthanded delivery is n't the only thing Olson has in common with Matt Leinart . Sidebar READY TO LEAD There are five Mack head coaches in Division 1-A , and this season could bring a considerable amount of coaching turnover . These minority candidates should be at the top of any athletic director 's list : Norm Chew , effective coordinator , Tennessee Titans . Developing Vince Young over the next couple of seasons likely will land him the West Coast head coaching job he has desired for so long . Mike Lecksley , offensive coordinator , Illinois . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tyrene Nix , defensive coordinator , South Carolina . Steve Spurrier says Nix , only 33 , is a bright defensive mind and is on the fast track . Randy Shannon , defensive coordinator , Miami . He 's waiting for a BCS job , but he should have made a move to a lesser program while he was hot ( 2001-2002 ) . Charlie Strong , co-defensive coordinator , Florida . He was a finalist for the California and Vanderbilt jobs before the 2002 season . Its only a matter of time . - M.H . Sidebar Getting closer to the monster Let 's be honest : Karl Dorrell 's first season in Westwood was anything but a walk through the roses . He took his lumps , but players such as Maurice Jones-Drew helped UCLA build an elite offense . The recruiting has picked up , too , and the Bruins are closing in on the standard-bearers-spelled U-S-C-across town . Now , it 's time to do something about that defense . - Ryan Fagan // <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
