Rita Wilsons aunt died of breast cancer . After the actress herself found a lump-ultimately benign-she decided to take action . Here , she talks to Leslie Pepper about why there 's hope , and what you need to do to protect yourself // This year , more than 210,000 American women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer , and almost 40,000 will lose their battle with the illness , while one in nine women in the United States will develop it at some point during their lifetime . Rita Wilson 's own experience with the disease has made her an advocate for breast-cancer awareness ; since 1997 , she has helped raise more than $14 million as a member of the Cedars-Sinai Research for Women 's Cancers group , in tandem with Saks Fifth Avenue , with the annual fundraiser An Unforgettable Evening . Saks Fifth Avenue 's Key to the Cure initiative launches September 17 . Harper 's Bazaar : Of the many charities out there , why did you choose Cedars-Sinai Research for Women 's Cancers ? Rita Wilson : I lost an aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I like that they do n't focus solely on breast cancer-it 's ovarian cancer , uterine cancer , anything related to us girls . What also appeals to me is that there 's no bureaucracy . When we get the money , it goes straight into the fund . If the hospital needs something , they ask , and the fund writes them a check instantly . HB : Tell me about your personal experience with cancer . RW : I had a benign breast lump removed in 1987 . If that 's not enough to get you scared , I do n't know what is . HB : How did this event change you ? RW : It was scary . You begin to think , I 'm not unique-this could absolutely be happening to me . I became more vigilant about my health . I do monthly breast checks and get yearly mammograms . HB : Did you find the lump yourself or did your doctor discover it ? RW : I found it myself . The truth of the matter is , early detection is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it and not be afraid , and go see your doctor if you have to . HB : What do you think is the most important thing for women to do to help protect themselves against breast cancer ? RW : It has to be the monthly breast self-exam . It is crucial to have an awareness of your own body and the changes in it . HB : How does your involvement benefit the Cedars-Sinai group ? RW : I think that what I bring to the table is the ability to call up my friends and say , " Will you please perform ? " " Will you please allow us to honor you ? " " Will you please come and introduce or emcee ? " or whatever . HB : Your husband , Tom Hanks , also participates with fundraising efforts . How did you persuade him to join you ? RW : It 's a no-brainer , right ? If he had n't gotten involved , would n't you be mad at him ? He 's never missed an event either . HB : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award now called the Courage Award , which honors those who have committed their lives to helping others . How did that feel ? RW : It was very bittersweet . Around that time , a dear friend of mine , Liz Tilberis then editor in chief of Harper 's Bazaar , was dying of ovarian cancer . The people who are most courageous are the ones who go through the illness and the treatment and , hopefully , the recovery . Those people-and the ones who take care of the ill-they 're extraordinary . So I felt a little like I did n't really deserve it . I suppose there 's some value in being able to do a lot of work and show up at an event and get an award ... but I did n't really feel worthy of it . HB : Is there enough research being done on breast cancer ? RW : Until there 's a cure , there 's not enough being done . Saks Fifth Avenue 's Key to the Cure initiative , founded in partnership with the Entertainment Industry Foundation and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special shopping weekend , running September 17-20 . During that period , a percentage of all sales at Saks stores will be donated to local and national women 's reproductive-cancer and breast-cancer research centers . Sidebar " I had a lump removed .
