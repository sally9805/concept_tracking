THE MUSEUM OF DR . MOSES by Joyce Carol Oates 1 . 1956 " Mommy ! " The things flew at me out of the sky . I thought they were darning needles stabbing my face . Some were in my hair , and some had gotten inside the pink ruffled sundress Mommy had sewed for me . I was trying to shield my eyes . I was four years old , I knew nothing of self-defense , yet instinctively I knew to shield my eyes . A stabbing , stinging , angry buzzing against my face , my cheeks , my tender exposed ears ! I screamed , " Mommy ! Mommy ! " And there came Mommy to rescue me , only just happening to worry about where I might be , having wandered off behind my grandfather 's hay barn ; only just happening , as she would say afterward , to tilt her head to listen attentively for the cry of a little girl that might easily have been confused with the sharp cries of birds or cicadas or the half-feral tomcats that lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't hesitate for a moment . She ran swift and unerring as a young girl , though she was thirty-two years old and had not fully recovered from a miscarriage the previous spring , and was not in any case a woman accustomed to running . She heard my desperate cries and was herself panicked and yet had enough presence of mind to tear a bath towel off my grandmother 's clothesline with which to wrap me , roughly , efficiently , as if putting out flames . Mommy shielded me from the wasps with both the towel and her bare , vulnerable flesh . She was being stung herself , a dozen times , yet tried to comfort me as I screamed in pain and terror " It 's all right , Ella ! Mommy 's got you . " She half-carried me , half-ran with me out of the orchard , away from the pear tree disfigured by black knot and by a gigantic wasps ' papery gray nest attached like a goiter to the tree trunk overhead at a height of about nine feet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nowhere . Long afterward my mother would say with her breathy , nervous laugh that she had n't felt much pain herself , at the time . Not until later . For nothing had mattered except rescuing me . " My mother saved my life , when I was four years old . " This was a statement I would make often , to new friends , or to people who , for one reason or another , I hoped to impress . I was so loved once . I was a very lucky child . " My mother gave me life , and my mother saved my life . When I was four years old . " Is this true ? I wonder : could a child die of multiple wasp stings ? I think probably , yes . I think a child could die of the shock of the stings , the trauma of the assault as well as the wasps ' venom . Perhaps an adult woman could die of such an assault , too . 2 . THE SUMMONS Twenty-two years later , driving north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past decade and to whom I had n't spoken for several years , I was thinking of these things . Driving north to the town of my birth , Strykersville , New York , and beyond Strykersville into the abandoned farmland and foothills of Eden County , I told myself , as if to comfort myself , the familiar story : four-year-old Ella exploring Grandpa 's pear orchard , wandering far from the adults seated on the veranda of the old farmhouse , attacked suddenly by wasps that seemed to fly at her out of the sky ; screaming , " Mommy ! " and Mommy running desperately to save her . It was a fairy tale with a happy ending . ( But where in this story was Daddy ? He had not yet left us . He must have been there , somewhere . Or had he , too , wandered off from the adults on the veranda , in another direction ? Maybe he 'd even gotten into the car and driven away , into Strykersville , restless for a change of scene . An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy in my story , and had never been . ) Like all beloved family stories , this story had been enhanced over the years . It had been enlarged to include a description of Ella 's pretty pink sundress with the ruffled bodice which she 'd worn for the first time that day , and Ella 's blond-gold hair prettily braided , by Mommy , into two shoulder-length plaits entwined with pink satin ribbons . It had been enlarged to include an acknowledgment of my mother 's physical condition , which had n't been robust . Yet Ginny never hesitated . How that woman ran ! And none of us had even heard Ella crying . Snapshots of those lost years show my older brother Walter and me smiling and seemingly happy , and Mommy more somber , though attempting her usual earnest smile ; a youngish woman with an oddly wide , sensual mouth ; her dark hair parted on the left side of her head in the overly prim style of the Fifties . In a typical picture Mommy would be crouching between Walter and me , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent us from squirming ; face blurred , eyes averted shyly from the camera ( which had probably been held by Daddy , who 'd liked mechanical things , and had not liked his picture taken , at least with his young family ) . Poor Ginny . She had n't been well .... Because , it was vaguely said , of the miscarriage ; because she 'd never gotten over giving birth to the little girl , a thirty-hour labor ; because of certain " female weaknesses . " ( Meaning what ? In that era in which breast , cervical , and ovarian cancer as well as more ordinary menstrual problems were mysteriously alluded to as " women 's shame , " it was difficult to guess what this ominous term meant . ) And because , just possibly , though this was never uttered in my hearing , she had a husband with a quick temper and quick fists who 'd tired of loving her during her first pregnancy . But Ginny is so devoted . So forgiving . Forgiving ! That was the primary reason I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured my father 's crude , often dangerous behavior when Walter and I were growing up , but , after her divorce , when I was in high school , she fell into the same pattern with Walter . He 'd dropped out of school and never kept a job for more than a few weeks ; he was a " charming " boy but a chronic drinker while still in his teens . Mother pleaded with me to be more understanding . " Ella , you 're too hard on your brother . Ella , he 's your brother . " And I would secretly think , embittered as only a good dutiful daughter can be , confronted with her mother 's weak , hapless love for one who did n't deserve it , No . He is n't my brother , he 's your son . After my grandparents died , Mother inherited their farm . It was only eleven acres , yet a fairly large property by Eden County standards . This she 'd sold piecemeal , year by year ; she worked at various jobs in Strykersville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist , saleslady at Strykersville 's department store , substitute junior high school teachera nightmare job she 'd dreaded ) , and I 'd taken part-time jobs while still in high school ; but Walter drained our meager savings , my damned brother was always the issue , and when Mother paid a $2500 fine for him after an accident he 'd had driving while intoxicated , an accident in which the other driver was seriously injured , I stopped speaking to Mother . You 've chosen between us . Good ! I was disgusted with family life and with small-town life . I left Strykersville at the age of seventeen , attended the State Teachers ' College at Oneida on a scholarship , worked at part-time jobs to support myself for four years , and was proud of my independence . I associated Strykersville with the past and I had no nostalgic yearning for the past , I 'm not a sentimental person . For what is sentiment but weakness , and usually female weakness . I am not one of you . I lived now outside Philadelphia . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private school . I told myself that I did n't miss my mother , and I certainly did n't miss my brother , who 'd disappeared into America sometime in the mid-Seventies . I had friends , and I had loversto a degree . ( No one has ever gotten too close to me . Except for my mother , which is the reason I do n't entirely trust anyone . ) If the subject of family came up , I explained that I was " estranged " from mine . That had a dignified 19th-century sound . But one evening , with an older woman friend , I began talking of my mother who 'd " saved " my life , and I became emotional . I began telling my friend of the knitting , embroidering , sewing my mother had done , so many beautiful things , over the years ; she asked if I had any of these things and I said yes , I 'd taken a few articles of clothing when I 'd left home , a knitted cashmere coat-sweater , a long-sleeved silk blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend examined these items , and marveled over them " Your mother is a wonderful seamstress . And she 's never sewn for money ? " I shrugged indifferently . Possibly I had not wanted to feel emotion . " I do n't really wear this kind of clothing , " I said . " It is n't my style . " My friend was peering at the inside of the silk blouse , holding it to the light . " See this fine stitching ? This is the Fortuny stitch . And this exquisite lace hem . What an interesting woman your mother must be ! " I looked , and saw , yes , the stitching was fine , and intricate , but what was the point of it ? And the lace hem : Why had my mother gone to so much trouble , to hem a blouse in lace , on the underside of the material where no one would ever see ? Driving north to Strykersville , a distance of several hundred miles from my home , I thought of these things as a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the oppressive heat of August , after so many years , I thought of my mother as she 'd been , as a way of not thinking of the woman she might be now . She was fifty-four years old . To me , at twenty-six , old . She was " Mrs. Moses Hammacher " now , she 'd remarried abruptly , the previous March . Wife of Dr. Moses ! After almost twenty years of being a divorced woman in a small town where divorce was rare , yet a divorced woman whose husband was known to have been an abusive alcoholic , so that sympathy was entirely with my mother , and no one would have dreamt of criticizing her , my mother had suddenly , without warning , remarried : a locally known retired physician and Eden County coroner named Moses Hammacher , familiarly called " Dr. Moses . " Dr. Moses ! He 'd been an old man , gaunt and white-haired , or so it had seemed to me , when I was in junior high . Mother , how could you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a brief letter to her , sending it in care of relatives to be forwarded . I had to assume the letter had been received by my mother thoughof courseMother had n't answered it . Since then I had not slept well . My sleep was thin like mist or spray , disturbed by strange echoing voices and muffled laughter . And my mother 's voice sudden , pleadingElla ? Come to me ! Help me . In Strykersville , I drove across the familiar jarring railroad tracks and it was as if I 'd never left . Though I had been imagining my hometown as unpopulated , for some reason , a ghost town , yet of course there was traffic on the streets , there were people on the sidewalks downtown , and probably I would recognize some of these people if I lingered . I did take note of the number of FOR RENT FOR LEASE FOR SALE signs ; I saw abandoned , boarded-up houses . I drove past our old church , the First Presbyterian , to which Mother had taken Walter and me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past my old high school , which had been renovated and enlarged ; I felt my heartbeat quicken in apprehension and dread . Why am I here ? She does n't want me . If she wanted me ... Mother had not invited me to her wedding , of course . She had not even informed me she 'd remarried , I had learned from relatives . The shock of it ! The shame . Learning that your mother has remarried , from relatives . And that she was now the wife of " Dr. Moses . " I 'd instructed myself before I began my trip that I would not do this , yet here I was driving around Strykersville , staring with rapt , lovesick eyes . Did I miss my past , truly ? Did I miss this ? I 'd thought myself very shrewdand very luckyto have escaped this economically depressed region of upstate New York as I 'd escaped the confinements of my former life , and it seemed to me a risky matter , a sign of my own recklessness , that I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a gigantic cobweb . " Mother ! God damn you . " For there I was driving slowly past our old brown-shingled house on Iroquois Street , with the flower beds Mother had worked so hard to keep in bloom , and the flowering Russian olive tree she 'd kept watered through summer droughts , my eyes misting over with tears . The house now belonged to strangers of course . I wondered what price Mother had gotten for the property , and where the money had gone : for according to my cousin Brenda , who 'd been the one to give me information about Mother , she 'd sold everything very quickly , including most of her long-cherished furniture , and even her car , after her " private " wedding to Dr. Moses Hammacher , and had gone to live with her new husband in his stone house in the Oriskany hills nine miles northeast of Strykersville . The doctor had had an office in Strykersville , in fact he 'd had two offices , as a G.P. and as Eden County coroner ; but he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses , or Dr. Hammacher , still saw some of his elderly patients ; and that he 'd turned part of his house into a kind of museum . " Museum ? " I asked incredulously , and Brenda explained it was probably just an old man 's hobby " To give him something to do , you know , in his retirement . " " But is this an actual museum ? Open to the public ? " Brenda said , " After the Fowler House was taken over by the County Historical Society , and all those old antiques , weaving looms , dressmakers ' dummies , washboards and butter churns and whatever were put on display , Dr. Moses demanded money from the Society to start a museum of his own . A history of medical arts in Eden County which means , I suppose , a history of Dr. Moses ! So the Society gave him a small grant , to humor him , but he wanted more , and broke off relations with the Society , and I guess he has this museum out in Oriskany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeletons and cadavers ' made of plaster , old instruments , office equipment , things floating in formaldehyde ... A few people went to see it out of curiosity when it opened about five years ago , but I never went . " Brenda paused . She was conscious of speaking in an amused voice , and had suddenly to realize that she was talking about my new stepfather . " Ella , I 'm sorry . I 'm sure ... your mother is happy with Dr. Moses . " But she sounded doubtful . I said , miserably , " Why on earth would Mother marry Dr. Moses ? He 's old enough to be her father . " And my grandfather . But I do n't want another grandfather . Brenda said sympathetically , " I can imagine you 're upset , Ella . We all were , at first . I mean ... your mother is so sweet . So trusting . And Dr. Moses is , well ... a kind of strong-willed man , I guess . He must be in his mid-eighties , yet he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind is sharp as always . Razor-sharp . Maybe your mother needs someone strong-willed to take care of her . " Was this a reproach ? Quickly Brenda amended , " Ella , your mother told me , when I happened to run into her downtown a few days before the wedding , that she was embarking upon a new life'she was very happy'she and Dr. Moses were driving to Mexico , where she 'd never been , on their honeymoon . She said she had been very lonely'but that was over now . I 'm sure that she married Dr. Moses voluntarily ; I mean , I do n't think he coerced her in any way . You know what your mother is like , Ella ! " Did I ? Even when I 'd lived with my mother , had I known her ? As if hoping to console me , now that she 'd upset me , Brenda went on to say that Dr. Moses was still an individual of some reputation in the county . He still drove his fancy British car , a twenty-year-old silver-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county ; he 'd also acquired a Land Cruiser , a combination van and trailer of the kind popular with retired people . Still he cut a gentlemanly , dapper figure in Strykersville with his dignified derby hats in cool weather and festive straw hats in warm weather . He wore his trademark pinstriped suits , white starched cotton shirts with monogrammed gold cuff links , striped neckties . People respected him , though they tended to joke nervously about him as they 'd always done . ( I recalled how , years ago , my high school girlfriends made a show of shuddering and shivering as Dr. Moses passed by us on the sidewalk , tipping his hat and smiling his white-toothed smile , " Good day , girls ! " His gaze , mildly defracted by bifocal lenses , lingered on us . We had to wonder who would wish to be county coroner and examine dead , sometimes badly disfigured and mangled bodies extracted from wrecks ? And for virtually no salary . ) This tall white-haired gentleman had been both " Dr. Hammacher , " a well-to-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the cheery county official who was invited into public schools in the district to give talks and slide presentations with such titles as " You and Your Anatomy " and " The Miracle of Eyesight . " As Dr. Moses he exuded an air of civic responsibility like those fanatically active businessmen who ran the Strykersville Chamber of Commerce , the Rotary Club , the Royal Order of Moose , and other service organizations . I 'd thought him older than my grandfather back in the mid-Sixties when he came to our junior high assembly to speak on " The Miracle of Eyesight . " For this , an energetic talk that left the more sensitive among us queasy , Dr. Moses used a large plaster-of-paris eyeball as a prop ; it swung hideously open in sections to reveal the veiny interior of the eye , uncomfortably suggesting a dissection . I felt lightheaded , and resistant . Yet Dr. Moses must have made a strong impression on me since I remembered long afterward certain parts of the eye : the " pupil " the " cornea " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the " sclera " the " aqueous humor " the " vitreous humor " the " optic nerve " the " blind spot . " Dr. Moses concluded his presentation by appealing to us , " So you see , boys and girls , the miraculous anatomy of the human eye alone teaches us that evolution'the blind chance of natural selection , survival of the fittestis simply not feasible . No organ so complex as the human eye could have evolved ' in a hit-or-miss fashion as the Darwinists say . Nor could it have evolved out of some primal protoplasm . It would have to have been , like our souls , created . " Dr. Moses squinted at us through his shiny bifocals . " By a creator . " How dramatically the man spoke ! In our naivet some of us may have confused white-haired Dr. Moses in his gray pinstripe suit with creator . " Are there any questions , boys and girls ? " Our mouths wanted to smile , to grimace and giggle , but could not . And now , as in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Moses was my stepfather . Dazed , I heard Brenda 's cautious voice . She was asking , " Ella ? You are n't crying , are you ? " and I said quickly , incensed , " Of course I 'm not crying ! I 'm laughing . " 3 . IN ORISKANY Strange to be driving here alone . I stopped in Strykersville only briefly , and continued out into the country toward Oriskany As I ascended into the hills I felt as if I were driving , under a strange half-pleasurable compulsion , into the past : there were farmhouses , barns , granaries I vaguely recalled , though a number of these were for sale or abandoned ; there was the old Starlite Drive-In on the Oriskany Pike , a morose , funereal ruin jutting up above overgrown fields . About three miles north of Strykersville I crossed the high , humpbacked rusted-iron bridge above the Eden Creek which I vaguely recalled as one of the nightmare bridges of my childhood : below , the creek was diminished and mud-colored , its gnarled banks exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge ramp I saw , nailed to an oak tree by the side of the road , a small , darkly weathered sign :
