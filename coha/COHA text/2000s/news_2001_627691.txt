<p> When Lyndon B. Johnson was in the White House , Texas was awash in federal dollars for military bases , defense contractors , job training and public works . <p> Two decades later , then-President Bush kept his home state 's interests in mind as he engineered the North American Free Trade Agreement and steered the superconducting super collider to North Texas . <p> After they left office , Johnson and Bush were honored with construction of presidential libraries and prestigious public-policy schools . Johnson 's Central Texas ranch became an enduring tourist attraction . <p> So what 's in it for Texas when George W. Bush is sworn in as the 43rd president Saturday ? <p> For one thing , there might be more attention given to some issues of great interest to Texas , such as support for the U.S. Customs Service and Border Patrol . <p> But most experts say Texas probably wo n't get much more than its usual share of federal dollars and programs . Bush 's fiscal conservatism makes it unlikely he 'll allow many homegrown boondoggles , they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton did n't go overboard helping his home state of Arkansas , a federal spending watchdog said . <p> Still , " Arkansas did n't really suffer financially under Clinton , and I do n't think Texas is going to suffer financially , " said David Williams , vice president of Citizens Against Government Waste . <p> " If a project is not 100 percent meritorious , it may still get the nod from the president if it 's from Texas , " he predicted . And it might be tempting for Texas lawmakers to seek to take advantage of their ally in the Oval Office . <p> " It 's going to be interesting to see if the Texas delegation uses their clout to get more spending . But George W. Bush , per se , would not get a lot of pork , because it has to go through Congress , " Williams said . <p> Do n't look for any spending shenanigans from this president and Congress , said one congressional aide . <p> " What Texans can expect of the Bush administration is a fair shake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to pronounce Mexia and know where it is , " said Larry Neal , a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm , R-Texas . <p> " When Sen. Gramm approaches the new administration on things like expanding the Border Patrol or the Customs Service , which are important to us and our state , we expect a rather substantially improved and warmer reception than we got from the previous administration , " Neal said . <p> The same should be true as Texas endures more natural disasters and has other pressing needs for federal assistance in coming years , various observers said . At the same time , Bush has enough Texas support that he should n't have to resort to blatant favoritism to keep friends back home , they said . <p> " We 'll never go back to the heyday of LBJ 's time , " said U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez , D-San Antonio . <p> " We 'll do better , though , than we did with George Bush , whom I 've never thought of as Texan through and through , " Gonzalez said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas vein - his roots truly are Texan . His relationships and acquaintances and the fact that he was governor give him tremendous insight . And sure , I 'm hoping he gives us assistance , but that depends on how well the Texas delegation pulls together on common issues , " he said . <p> Bush soon will unveil his first proposed budget , a document that should shed light on any hopes he might have to give Texas a postelection thank-you . It wo n't be clear until autumn what kind of Texas-friendly spending Bush authorizes for fiscal 2002 . Among the bellwethers are outlays for Texas-based computer companies that stand to benefit from technology-development programs . <p> It might never be known what kind of influence Bush exerts on federal agencies ' discretionary spending - also known as " executive-branch pork " - to benefit Texas citizens and corporations . <p> " That is virtually impossible to decipher and track , " Williams said . His group , which monitors easier-to-find " congressional pork , " determined that Arkansas did n't get abnormal amounts during Clinton 's tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer for the last eight years . But when looking at the ( congressional ) pork that has gone to Arkansas , it has not gone up , " Williams said . <p> " It 's not necessarily a creature of the president , " he added . <p> During LBJ 's tenure , it was easier to point to projects he influenced , and not just the refurbishing of his Johnson City homestead . Though he often is credited with bringing NASA to Texas , many of the key decisions on the space program were made before he reached the White House . <p> But LBJ did use his influence to help NASA and the aerospace industry , as well as to launch a variety of programs using Texas as the starting point , a former aide said . Among them were the Job Corps , whose San Marcos facility became a national model ; housing initiatives ; and economic development , urban renewal and anti-poverty programs . <p> " Johnson always liked to have Texas taking the forefront in developing models for all those programs , " said George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , the state 's defense contractors and military bases were fully engaged , thanks to some degree of LBJ influence . <p> " It was different times , the Cold War , " Christian said . " The 1960s was a time of military buildup , and Texas certainly got a good share of that . " <p> Some Texas contractors also won lucrative deals for overseas jobs such as building military bases , Christian said . <p> As for the next president , Christian predicted , " He 's certainly going to be a president from Texas , but I think he 'll do his utmost to avoid being tagged as somebody who 's doing nothing but looking after Texas . " <p> Campaigning for national office , Bush did n't call for colossal new expenditures in his home state , focusing instead on across-the-board plans such as tax cuts , military pay increases , technology development and improvements in social and education programs - all with potential impact on Texas . Bush also advocated federal belt-tightening and control of wasteful spending . <p> So far , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush 's western White House at Crawford , though there are proposals to upgrade roads and one of three nearby airports to handle the new president 's entourage . <p> " We do n't know what size airplane he is going to use , and that will have an effect on which airport is chosen , " said Steve Smith , vice president of the Greater Waco Chamber of Commerce . " When that is determined , there is already a list from each airport as to what their needs are . " <p> Waco is the first Texas city to feel the economic repercussions of Bush 's rise to national power , having served as host to dignitaries , security agents and journalists . But the visits have only begun , and plans are in the works to bolster the region 's preparedness for a potential bonanza . The incoming president is sure to spur creation of businesses in Crawford , but it could be a while before Waco feels any boom . <p> " As far as bricks and mortar , that will come once we put our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55966 <p> Running 26.2 miles and winning the Compaq Houston Marathon on Sunday was merely the second most arduous thing Christopher Ciamarra of McKeesport , Pa. , did over the weekend . <p> Ciamarra , who has a fear of flying , climbed into his car in suburban Pittsburgh at 3 a.m . Friday and drove some 1,400 miles , reaching Houston around 5 p.m . Saturday , one hour before registration closed . <p> So which was more difficult , the drive or the run ? <p> " Oh , the drive , " Ciamarra said . " The whole way , I was nervous about making it on time . But I had a lot of time by myself to think about how I was going to run the race . " <p> Never in his wildest dreams did Ciamarra imagine a victory . The Washington , D.C. , native said he never had won anything more than regional races before Sunday . <p> Ciamarra took advantage of a field void of elite international runners to win the race in 2 hours , 29 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's winner since 1975 , the third year of the Houston Marathon . Last year , Stephen Ndungu 's winning time was 2:11:27 . <p> " It was a complete shock , " Ciamarra said . " I was n't expecting to win . I was just running my nice , steady pace , and when I looked up at mile 21 , there was only one guy ( Sean Wade ) ahead of me . <p> " Then he fell out , and all I saw was the ( pace ) truck . So I just took it and went with it . Fate was on my side , I guess , but this is a total surprise . " <p> Ciamarra was the first to admit he won by attrition . When he went ahead at mile 22 , he became the fourth runner to lead the race in a six-mile stretch . Ciamarra finished more than eight minutes ahead of James Lawrence of Orange ( 2:37:56 ) and was 12 minutes better than No. 3 John Zuilhof of Katy ( 2:41:26 ) . <p> In the women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also won going away . Alboucrek finished in 2:43:41 , a personal best , and easily defeated Sugar Land 's Joy Smith ( 2:55:52 ) . <p> Alboucrek grabbed the lead in the first mile and never was in trouble . Her winning time was well behind the 2:32:24 turned in last year by Tatiana Pozdnyakova . <p> The Houston Marathon did not award prize money this year , which weakened the field considerably . In the men 's division , four of the top 10 finishers were 41 or older , including Zuilhof , 41 , who won his first master 's title . Ciamarra , 30 , was not a factor during the first half of the race . The early pace was set by Joe Flores , Jerry Pullins and Daniel Shaw . At the midway point , Pullins was on pace for a 2:21 finish . <p> But his day came to a quick and puzzling end nearing mile 17 . Pullins , who had pulled ahead of Shaw and opened a lead of more than 100 yards , abruptly stopped running . <p> He got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation Pullins was using the Houston race as little more than a training run for a future marathon . <p> Pullins ' departure started a revolving door of leaders between mile 17 and mile 22 . Shaw gained the lead briefly but was out of the race by mile 19 . Flores took over after Shaw could go no farther , but he , too , could n't hold on . <p> Flores and Gannon White of Dayton , Texas , were running first and second when Wade , one of the few runners with international experience in the race , took over the lead heading into mile 22 . <p> Wade , who lives in Houston and represented New Zealand in the 1996 Olympics , was a late entry in Sunday 's race and seemed poised to steal it . But Wade , who missed a full year due to an injury and did n't resume training until last December , was passed by Ciamarra at mile 22 . Wade dropped out shortly after losing the lead . There was speculation Wade , too , was using the Houston Marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 miles . Not so , he said . <p> " I entered to win the race and for no other reason , " Wade said from his home afterward . " I ran out of steam . I thought I could run a 2:30 and win , but I did n't train well enough for a 2:30 . The quick pace that the one runner ( Pullins ) set forced me to run faster than I wanted , and I guess it caught up to me . " <p> Unlike the previous leaders , Ciamarra maintained his advantage . As he headed for home , Ciamarra scarcely could believe he was about to win . A year ago , he finished 16th in Houston , running the course in 2:35 . His time Sunday was about one minute off his personal best of 2:28:17 . <p> " In all honesty , I really do n't think I should have won this race , " Ciamarra said . " This is the pace I run every week . I just went along like I always do , really not even thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden , there was no one ahead of me or behind me . <p> " It was a strange feeling . " <p> After the race , Ciamarra , who manages a restaurant in McKeesport , appeared almost ill at ease during the award presentation and news conference . But then , he had a reason to be edgy . <p> " I 've got to get started driving home , " Ciamarra said . " I want to make Memphis by tonight , so I 've got to hit the road . " <p> At some point during the two-day drive , the fact he won the Houston Marathon likely will hit him . Sunday afternoon , he was having trouble believing it . <p> " I do n't know what to think , " he said . " I had the time I wanted to run in mind , and I did close to it . I thought I could have done a little better . But I never thought it would be good enough to win .

The article implied that minorities were excluded from the decision-making process on construction and finance and claimed there was a bias against minorities - particularly Hispanics . Yet nothing could be further from the truth . <p> The Sports Authority is responsible for putting the public 's interest first and minorities benefited greatly in the process . In fact , the Sports Authority came into being six months after the design teams were already in place for Enron Field . The Astros , the city and the county had also already designated contractors for a majority of the work . <p> However , the Sports Authority inherited no contracts and the project was over budget and behind schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default on the agreement the city and county had signed . <p> Crisis management was required . As then-chairman , I assigned board members to committees based on the criterion of experience . <p> Each member was specifically invited to attend every meeting of all committees , as was the public - including the construction and finance committees . <p> Despite a late start and inheriting many of the key players on the design and construction team , Enron Field finished on time and under budget . No other similar facility in America has matched that record . <p> Look at the facts , ignore the spin . Enron Field stands as an example of what can be done if public boards are fair and open and keep the public 's interest paramount . Everyone benefits . <p> Jack Rains , Houston <p> <p> Do n't send us all home <p> After reading Jack H. Bayless ' Jan. 10 Viewpoints letter , " Send foreigners home , " I was reminded of two stories . President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was addressing a meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow immigrants .

Mueller , Houston <p> <p> Inmates ' rights vs. ours <p> I used to be a correctional officer for the Texas Department of Corrections ' Ellis Unit in Huntsville . Occasionally , during the 20 years I worked there , I was assigned to work an " outside picket " ( gun tower ) located near the back of the prison compound . If anyone approached our picket , without prior authorization , we were instructed to verify their identity . <p> Before allowing anyone inside our picket ( including other officers ) , we were required to contact the building control center and confirm that person 's authority .

Martel , Houston <p> <p> Not buying rhetoric <p> I did n't buy the " compassionate conservative " rhetoric coming from George W. Bush 's camp during the presidential campaign and I buy it even less now . <p> By nominating Linda Chavez and John Ashcroft , both dogmatic conservatives with extremist views , Bush is proving how oxymoronic and hypocritical his campaign slogan really is . <p> The Chavez nomination was especially rife with hypocrisy . Her opposition to labor unions and such issues as workers ' rights , affirmative action , family leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we find out how incredibly hypocritical was her criticism of Zoe Baird during nomination hearings in 1993 . <p> As Chavez complains about the atmosphere in Washington being one of " search and destroy " politics , perhaps she should take some responsibility for her past participation in such politics . In her case , what went around did come around . <p> Robert Peterson , Houston <p> <p> Let councilman choose <p> City Councilman Rob Todd 's Jan 7 Outlook article ( " Space City can do better than a trolley line ) illustrated how some leaders at City Hall can not see past their rose-colored sunglasses , which are hiding the haze that hangs over our skyline . <p> We can not continue to keep paving the city over with concrete and expect to have clean air . <p> " Space City , USA " should show the world that we have the modern technology to transport Houstonians in a way which will not add to the pollution and which causes our health-care costs to be so high . <p> Howard Bingham , Houston <p> <p> Media promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News organizations pick firm to study Fla. ballots " : What a way to increase circulation and sell air time . <p> Who will really benefit from creating such controversy ? The article mentioned that George W. Bush 's lead had shrunk to just 154 votes , but failed to point out that this was after the rules had been changed . <p> Would n't it be more productive to disclose the military absentee votes that were disenfranchised because the U.S. Postal Service failed to apply postmarks ? Maybe nobody wants to disclose how much Bush 's lead would balloon if all the military votes counted . <p> But it would be easier to determine that data than to continue to scan dimpled ballots and it could be done by the Chronicle for less than the $ 500,000 spent on the firm and its eight media contributors . <p> Warren H.

Bush and Dick Cheney , and have embarrassed the nation as well as themselves . <p> Since they walked out in protest , they should not be allowed back until public apologies have been made to all . <p> Bob Shoquist , Conroe <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55959 <p> It 's a rainy Sunday afternoon , and the Bandidos motorcycle club has gathered at Bryant 's Ice House in Katy , a favorite hangout , for one of their regular , private meetings . <p> Long-haired , bearded outlaw bikers walk around talking on cellular phones .

Shiny motorcycles , covered in chrome , crowd the parking lot . <p> Guards man the entrances .

They want to talk to the outside world , set the record straight , discuss their lifestyle , which few understand and which , they say , the police misrepresent . <p> In the eyes of the police , the group is a closed society that puts secrecy and loyalty above all else . It is a money-making criminal enterprise that engages in drug dealing , prostitution , violence , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation by county , state and federal authorities , which included the infiltration of the group by undercover officers , netted the arrests of only two Bandidos and two women who hang around with the group , seizure of $ 250,000 worth of illicit drugs , some white supremacist material , Adolf Hitler collectibles and assets worth about $ 175,000 . The only charges stemming from the investigation were for drug possession and an additional charge against one female associate for drug delivery . <p> All of which infuriated thearea 's top Bandidos , who say they are frequent targets of the police and narcotics task forces trying to justify their funding . Theirs is not a criminal enterprise , they maintain . Despite their image and reputation , they say , the Bandidos are like anyone else - they have steady jobs , wives and children and are governed by a set of bylaws . Some of them even vote straight-ticket Republican . <p> " Mainstream America should be more like us , " says Jan " The Man " Christensen , vice president of the Bandidos ' Northwest Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Not so , say law enforcement officials , who insist the bikers will never admit the true nature of their fellowship - an organization dominated by money and pride , a network so sophisticated that it has lawyers on call . <p> The recent arrests , FBI spokesman Bob Doguim says , were not an isolated incident . <p> " I think it 's real important people understand everyone who rides a Harley-Davidson and has long hair is not a bad person , " Doguim said . " The way we conduct investigations , we follow information and intelligence that leads us to them . <p> " If that road leads us to the Bandidos , then it 's a road that 's going to be pursued . We 're not just out there arbitrarily picking groups to target . " <p> The Bandidos , as their motto attests , are the people your parents warned you about . <p> They look rough . Some have criminal histories . They ride noisy motorcycles . They sport leather vests , tattoos and earrings . They are non-conformists , loyal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women as possessions . <p> And while the mainstream might think , maybe hope , that such gangs faded away with the 1960s , nothing could be further from the truth . <p> Formed in the Galveston County community of San Leon in 1966 , the Bandidos have grown into an organization that today boasts 110 chapters in nine countries and a total membership base of 5,000 . About half of those chapters are in the United States . Others are in Germany , Australia , Denmark , France , Norway , Sweden , Finland and Luxembourg . <p> The group recently expanded to Canada , taking in or " patching over " a motorcycle club known as the Rock Machine and ushering in about 100 new members . <p> But police consider Houston , where the Bandidos have more national officers than any other major U.S. city and where the organization has 12 chapters and 175 members , a " power base " for the organization . <p> From Cloverleaf to Baytown , north Houston to southwest Houston , Texas City to Galveston , the Bandidos have a presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making less menacing . They claim they are represented by national officers who are drug-free and have a wide range of steady jobs . <p> Top officers in the Houston chapters include oil industry workers , a computer engineer , a metal fabricator and welder , a seaman and longshoreman , and a retired Union Pacific Railroad employee . One owns an antique automotive shop . Another is married to a lawyer and CPA . <p> And in the " mainstream world , " several Bandidos said , they pay a price for their membership in and loyalty to the gang . <p> " Log Cabin " Pat Morrison , for instance , says he was fired from his job as a concrete inspector the day after his boss saw his belt buckle identifying him as a Bandido . Morrison , who earned his nickname by sipping whiskey from a Log Cabin syrup bottle , makes no apologies and has no regrets . <p> " These people care about me , " Morrison says . " That 's what this is about , is support - physical , financial and mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . I kiss these men on the lips because I love them . " <p> When the Bandidos are all together and in full regalia , they come across much like an after-school boys ' club meeting secretly in some private clubhouse . <p> Absolutely no women are allowed to join . Rather , girlfriends are considered property of the Bandidos and are known as PBOLs - Proud Bandido Ol ' Ladies . <p> Bandidos have certain common symbols on their leather jackets - the 1% patch , the emblem representative of outlaw bikers , and the number 13 , which stands for the 13th letter of the alphabet , " M , " for motorcycles . It stands for other things , the police say - among them , methamphetamines and murder . The Bandidos scoff at this . <p> Their gatherings are called " church meetings , " and attendance is mandatory at some events , such as fellow Bandidos ' funerals . <p> And , much like a religion , the Bandidos have some sacred rules - no lying , no stealing , no messing with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these covenants can face a fine , a black eye or loss of the much-coveted patch displayed on his jacket . <p> The organization has strict bylaws governing certain types of drug use . Needle use is not tolerated . Likewise , the smoking of any chemicals - such as coke , speed or mandrax - is forbidden . <p> " If it did n't grow , do n't smoke it ! " the bylaws state . <p> The biker club has changed considerably over the years and can not be compared to its earlier , rougher days , says Jeff , a northwest Harris County resident who serves as the Bandidos ' international vice president and has been with the group since 1979 . Jeff did not want his last name used . <p> " Back then was back then , " he said , as the sounds of Steppenwolf 's Magic Carpet Ride rocked the bar . " Back then , if you rode a chopper , you were really an outlaw . You looked dirty , you acted dirty . You did n't want to be part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . . . Being a dirty old biker was a way of showing class . " <p> The Bandidos claim they do n't have to go looking for members ; people usually come to them . <p> The gang , which supposedly took its name from the popular Frito Bandito advertisements , was conceived by San Leon resident Donald Eugene Chambers during the Vietnam War era . Many Americans were returning home disenchanted . Veterans made up much of the early membership and the group 's colors mirrored those of the Marine Corps - red and gold . <p> Chambers not only founded the Bandidos , but also served as its first president . In 1972 , six years after the group 's inception , he and two others in the brotherhood were arrested for the murders of two brothers in El Paso whom they thought had burned them in a narcotics deal , according to law officers who have researched the Bandidos ' early days . <p> Chambers served time in prison .

Bikers turned out in droves for his funeral services in July 1999 , when he was buried in Pasadena . <p> Today , much of the word about the Bandidos is spread around the world via computer . Many Bandidos have personalized Web pages and e-mail accounts , which they use to communicate with each other . They know how to find each other in every town and frequently open their homes to fellow Bandidos from as far away as the other side of the world . <p> The Bandidos insist they are not white supremacists , despite the racist paraphernalia discovered during the police investigation . There are no blacks within the biker gang , but it does have a sizable Hispanic base and some Jewish , Japanese and Korean members . <p> Not just anyone can be a Bandido . <p> Newcomers must go through a lengthy initiation phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first exposed to the Bandidos as " prospects , " a trial period that lasts at least six months . <p> As a test of commitment , prospects must sign the title of their motorcycle over to the club . <p> " Like when you take out a loan , you got ta put up collateral , " said Auggie Will , a member of the Bandidos ' Galveston chapter . <p> Prospects also must be at the Bandidos ' beck and call 24 hours a day , seven days a week . They are often required to perform duties such as buying beer or standing in the parking lot to watch over motorcycles at functions . They answer to a sponsor , a seasoned Bandido who is responsible for the newcomer 's actions . <p> Full-fledged admission is only granted once a local chapter gives a 100 percent vote of approval .

To his right , his biographer had that day 's few questions . Straight ahead , a phalanx of cameras was in place , with reporters waiting to learn if he would play that night . A personal assistant had brought that day 's to-do list , while Raptors trainers waited to begin therapy on Carter 's spring-loaded but damaged leg . <p> " I deal with it and move on , " he said routinely . " I 'm just so used to it . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to talk , so I talk . It 's still hard sometimes . You want to go and relax . But you just do it . " <p> The demands placed on Carter are nothing new for celebrity athletes . They place many on themselves , as with Carter 's assorted meetings with sponsors . The photograph and autograph requests come with the territory and the millions . <p> But Carter 's burden is greater . <p> " He 's asked to carry the torch for basketball in Canada and to a degree in the States , " said Dave Haggith , the director of communications for Carter 's Visions in Flight organization . " The guy carries the local needs with Basketball Canada , the Toronto Raptors , the local basketball community , all the sponsors . He has a lot of weight other players do n't have . And he has it with whatever he does . It 's there all the time . " <p> For Carter , the job is more than meeting the expectations of being labeled the next Michael Jordan . That part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first wave of Next Jordans had their crosses to bear , to be sure . Penny Hardaway and Grant Hill understandably cringed at the comparisons they did not seek . The weight of Jordan 's legacy , whether defined by championships , records or popularity , was an unfair , unbeatable burden for them , too . <p> But for the latest generation of Next Jordans , there is a load greater than even Jordan had to carry . They have been asked to become the face of the league 's next " cycle . " With NBA attendance and ratings , to say nothing of the aesthetics of the game itself , slipping , they are asked not only to rebuild the league 's glory but also to return it to its highest standard . <p> Jordan was able to plant in ground already plowed by Magic Johnson and Larry Bird . And their era did not have to live up to a standard of popularity anywhere approaching the legacy current stars have been asked to match . <p> But for Carter , all that is not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada eye candy and assume viewers can been hooked into wanting more . It is not a coincidence the Rockets ' only national television appearance this season is tonight 's meeting with the Raptors . <p> Carter also must shoulder the fortunes of the NBA 's Canadian basketball experiment . With the Vancouver half of Canadian expansion lilting , the Raptors ' success can largely be traced to the draft day they acquired Carter . <p> " He handles it as well as anybody I 've ever been around , " teammate Mark Jackson said . " He 's a great guy . He carries a lot , but he carries it well . <p> " There 's a lot of pressure , but at the same time it 's a compliment , it 's a challenge , and Vince responds . He 's in demand 24/7 . But he can find the balance . " <p> There have been occasions , however , when the attention has seemed to wear on him . In an Olympic warmup game in Melbourne , Australia , Carter was goaded into a brief showdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local derision for weeks . <p> Carter responded with more posing and scowling than he had shown in his first two seasons in the NBA . <p> But those close to him said Carter was dealing with more pressures than a few chants from the stands or the expectation that he reprise his dunk-contest acrobatics with Olympic defenders theoretically getting in the way ( a demand he answered with " The Dunk , " his leap over 7-3 Frederick Weiss of France ) . <p> Carter had just reached an out-of-court settlement with Puma , which sued him for choosing to defect to Nike . His first NBA coach , Butch Carter , had been fired after a strange postseason departure from usual coaching prudence . His presumed running mate and cousin , Tracy McGrady , had left Toronto for Orlando . <p> Meanwhile , his parents , to whom he has remained extremely close , were going through a divorce . <p> Vince Carter would not say how much any of that affected him . But he did not seem to handle his usual load with the ease he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from veteran Olympic teammates about handling attention and demands . <p> " It made my job easier , " he said . " The focus was on the team , instead of on an individual . There were a lot of stars . There were a lot of good players on the team . That was really relaxing . " <p> But the stories circulated quickly from practices and otherwise relatively unnoticed games about how Carter had become the star of the stars , with amazed teammates and coaches spreading the tales . <p> " One play , the first time we ran it , the pass was n't there , " Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said . " He would jump , and the pass was out away from the backboard . He was jumping one way and went back and grabbed it . Just the look on the best players in the league 's faces was , ' My God ! I 've never seen anything like that . ' <p> " And of course , we were there for The Dunk , and that was an amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing on my mind was , ' He took off too far .

" <p> As much as Carter , who is averaging 28.5 points per game entering tonight 's action , must " carry the torch " of the sport and NBA basketball in Canada , carrying a team becomes a nightly , tangible load . <p> " I do n't mind , " he said . " Anything to help the team win . I love to win . I hate to lose . I do n't mind taking that challenge . I know it 's not all about me . It never will be . I do n't want it to be .

Bush prepares to take over the White House eight years after his father , he wo n't have that problem , observers say . But the crucial test will be whether he can sell that vision , his ideological blueprint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He has a vision , and it 's very clear , " said Rice University political scientist and pollster Robert Stein . " People just have n't taken him very seriously . " <p> Some skeptics , however , question the heft of Bush 's vision , saying his new bipartisanship and emphasis on diversity are more public relations than political philosophy . <p> Either way , Bush will need a certain amount of vision to propel his leadership , analysts say , in order to achieve the tax cuts , Social Security reform and increased military spending that are key points in his first-term agenda . <p> " Politics is the art of the possible , and as president you are constrained by so many things , " said David Lanoue , professor of political science at Texas Tech University . " Just because it 's your party in office does n't mean they are lockstep behind you , and you could have a vision but no guarantee it would be realized . " <p> Key elements of Bush 's vision have been forged over time through necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pragmatic strategy for dealing with a politically split Congress and the fallout from the divisive and prolonged presidential election . <p> Throughout his campaign , Bush frequently alluded to his plans for elevating the tone of politics , ending partisan warfare and working with the other party . <p> For Bush , questions about his vision represent the type of introspective , political navel-gazing he abhors . <p> The inevitable comparisons to his father 's presidency also hold potential minefields that Bush has carefully avoided since launching his presidential bid more than two years ago . <p> " I think he has already begun to define his presidency in one way , and show vision , by the quality of the people he 's selected for his Cabinet , " said Peter Roussel , a former White House aide to presidents Bush and Reagan who has known the president-elect for 30 years . <p> Even before his run for the presidency , however , Bush in his public life telegraphed a vision that includes but is not defined by " compassionate conservatism , " a term he coined to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfavorable comparisons to his father 's " Thousand Points of Light , " the name of a program that encouraged volunteerism but for some came to symbolize the elder Bush 's efforts to forge a vision of his own . <p> Part of the problem for the elder Bush , analysts said , was timing : Coming into office after President Reagan was a detriment to the former vice president , who suffered from comparisons to the president whom scholars call a great communicator . <p> Bush , by contrast , grappled with what one national magazine dubbed " the wimp factor " and seemed perpetually unable to define and articulate where he wanted to take the nation , according to his critics . <p> Perhaps not coincidentally , the younger Bush - who worked on his father 's unsuccessful re-election campaign - frequently invokes values such as cooperation , along with proposals for running the government . <p> The former president anticipated such comparisons in a 1998 letter he wrote to sons George W. Bush , re-elected Texas governor that year , and Jeb Bush , elected Florida 's governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journalists . . . will have to write not only on your plans and your dreams , but will have to compare those with what , in their view , I failed to accomplish , " he wrote . <p> During his presidency , Bush 's approval ratings soared in the wake of the Desert Storm military action . In the end , however , he was unable to parlay his success into re-election . <p> Many analysts say the elder Bush 's failure to define an overarching philosophy for his administration partly cost him his 1992 bid for re-election . <p> In the final chapter of his own campaign autobiography , A " Charge to Keep , " George W. Bush explained the philosophy behind his " compassionate conservative " slogan and why he was seeking the presidency . <p> " Compassionate conservatism is neither soft nor fuzzy , " Bush wrote . " Compassionate conservatism applies conservative , free-market principles to the real job of helping real people , all people , including the poor and disadvantaged . " <p> Talk about the poor and disadvantaged , typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush 's particular vision , said University of Texas presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan . <p> " It 's his task , his vision , to bring about a new way of doing political business , " Buchanan said . " In his heart of hearts , what he would like to do and be remembered for is being a certain kind of leader who elevates the tone . " <p> Bush 's Cabinet and staff appointments reflect his interest in diversity , political experts noted . The challenges some of those nominees are facing in the confirmation process could portend the battles Bush faces in realizing his vision for the country . <p> " He talks about reaching out to Democrats , and he is pictured with people of color , and he puts a few people of color in top appointments , but if they all have the same ideology , that 's not reaching out , " said Ann Crigler , political science professor at the University of Southern California . <p> By running on promises to forge a new relationship with Congress , Bush may have set himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered in the presidency . <p> " Governors tend to come in conceptualizing Congress as their state Legislature , but Congress thinks of itself as a co-equal institution , " Lanoue said . <p> Already , Bush 's conciliatory posture has chafed some of the more conservative elements in his party , whose leaders in Congress have a different sort of vision , Lanoue said . At the same time , many Democrats do not appear appeased by his efforts . <p> " He already has Democrats muttering that he was n't elected legitimately , and I do n't see why they would feel intimidated by him , " Lanoue said . " Their brazenness in taking off after some of his nominees suggests a level of confidence the defeated party does n't usually have . " <p> Still , many political observers are divided on the importance of presidential vision . Roussel , the veteran of two administrations , said vision rates with " spin " and " defining moment " in the pantheon of useless platitudes . <p> " The important thing is having core beliefs and following them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is a lot of give and take . In his case , he was darn good at it in Austin , Texas . And Washington , D.C. , is n't Austin , Texas , but George W.

And that is why Matthews decided the museum should tell African-American military history from the Revolutionary War to modern times . <p> " The museum was formed because of the Buffalo Soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal collection , " Matthews said . " But we want to introduce patrons to more things and have a perspective . We want people to know we were there , too - it 's part of American history . " <p> There was a time when Matthews , now 55 , did n't know the story , either . It was n't until he attended Prairie View A &M; University , from which he graduated in 1967 , that he learned about Buffalo Soldiers . He fell in love with their adventurous tales and began reading everything he could find about them . <p> But he did n't begin collecting memorabilia until he served in the Army in Vietnam in 1969-70 . The young second lieutenant received a Bronze Star and a combat medical badge . <p> For 29 years he has worked for Merck &; Co. , a pharmaceutical firm where he is now an executive business manager . But Matthews ' spare time is devoted to his avocation - the Buffalo Soldiers . <p> " I believe in the honor , valor and courage of these men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enthusiasm to do this . " <p> Opening the museum has been Matthews ' dream for some years - since his wife , Barbara , pointed out that his collection had begun to take over their home . <p> But he had to wait until his job brought him back to Houston in 1997 , after living in San Antonio , Seattle and Philadelphia . Houston is where the La Marque native began working as a Merck sales rep . <p> Matthews was joined in his dream by Robert Powell , 76 , a decorated World War II veteran Matthews fondly refers to as " Trooper " Powell . The two met because of their membership in the 9th and 10th ( Horse ) Cavalry Association , a historical group formed to keep alive the spirit and history of the Buffalo Soldiers . <p> Powell was trained by members of the 9th and 10th Cavalry ( disbanded in 1951 ) in Mineral Wells . He went on to be part of the first integrated unit that fought in World War II . <p> Seven months ago , Matthews and Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . They found space in an office building at Southmore and Almeda , near the Museum District , and spent several months organizing and displaying artifacts - with help from friends and family . <p> Matthews used $ 30,000 of his own money to start the museum , which opened Jan 5 . He has since received more funds from the community . More than 400 people attended the museum 's opening , and Matthews expects an equal number to attend the March 2 debut of a play he commissioned , " Ai n't Nobody Going to Turn Me ' Round . " <p> When he retires from Merck in 11 months , Matthews plans to make the museum his full-time avocation . In the meantime , his wife , other family members and Merck colleagues help run the operation . <p> As far as Matthews is concerned , the history of the military is deeply rooted in African-American history . One of the first casualties in the Revolutionary War was Crispus Attucks , a freedman who lived in Boston . <p> The museum 's posters and documents show activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad , as well as quotes from the eloquent Frederick Douglass . <p> After the Civil War , which thousands of blacks fought in , an act of Congress in 1866 created six African-American Army units - including the 9th and 10th Cavalries . Many of the soldiers were former slaves and Civil War veterans , though 20 percent were free men . <p> " The Buffalo Soldiers had a peculiar situation , " Matthews said . " Most were just off the plantation , and they were moved out to settle a conflict between the Indians and white settlers . But their mission was to make peace . They were paid $ 13 a month , more than they could make anyplace in the South . " <p> In the military , he said , the freed slaves had food and shelter and could learn to read and write . <p> Many served at Fort Davis in West Texas , now a national historical site , which has a large display in their honor . <p> Fort Davis was in the middle of the El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The road also intersected the Comanche war trail , as well as routes followed by the Mescalero Apaches on raids into South Texas and Mexico . <p> It was a tense and dangerous area after the Civil War , and the Buffalo Soldiers were right in the middle of it . <p> " One of the things I ask teens when they come in , " Matthews said , " is this : ' If you were pinned down between San Antonio and El Paso , who do you think would come and save you - John Wayne or the 9th and 10th Cavalry ? ' " <p> The answer , of course , is the cavalry . <p> One room of the museum is dedicated to the Buffalo Soldiers ' role in the West . Photos show them on parade at Fort Davis and escorting American Indian prisoners to court . <p> Artifacts include letters from cavalry units ' white commanders , an original U.S. Army belt and buckle , a saddle bag , a mess kit and hardtack . <p> " We have tons of pictures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Matthews said . " It also makes us very mobile , so we can go to schools . " <p> In his presentations , Powell stresses that fighting American Indians , Mexican revolutionaries , outlaws and rustlers was not all the Buffalo Soldiers did . <p> They also helped explore and map the Southwest , build forts and roads and protect stagecoaches and telegraph wires . <p> Over the years , Matthews has traveled to many military museums to see how they are organized . It adds a definite " spit and polish " to the displays , which also include sections on black chaplains and the Women 's Army Corps . <p> Retired Gen. Colin Powell , now secretary of state , has a strong presence in the museum . He is pictured with other African-Americans first to hold the highest ranks in the armed forces . Not only was he the first African-American to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff , but he also helped bring attention to the proud history of the Buffalo Soldiers . He was responsible , Matthews said , for the memorial in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Matthews planned to devote one room to the two world wars . But so many contributions were made from the community that the display now represents a number of different wars . Nearby are 12 brass plaques noting important events in African-American military history . <p> While many historical tales and texts are written about war , African-Americans have often been left out or misrepresented , Matthews and Powell said . They hope the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum will help to educate and change that . <p> " It is a strange thing that a man or woman can render service to a country , and someone with a pen will leave them out , " Powell said . <p> <p> Buffalo Soldiers National Museum <p> Where : 1834 Southmore <p> When : 10 a.m. - 5:30 p.m .

Their backers on City Council , reluctant to use such terms in public debate , fret about cost and fraud . <p> However , companies and cities that offer domestic-partner insurance benefits to their employees say such worries should be minimal . Several contacted by the Houston Chronicle last week reported that the cost of expanding the benefits is minimal and that implementing the program has not led to any problems . <p> Consequently , gay-rights advocates and other supporters of the benefits proposal say this shows that the real issue is a moral argument over homosexuality . <p> And while council members like Mark Ellis say fraud is the major concern - he wants any major medical claim made by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community leaders cut to a more biblical argument . <p> The chairman of the Greater Houston Area Pastor 's Roundtable , the Rev. Laurence L. White of Our Savior Lutheran Church , sent the group 's 600 members a letter urging them to " stand in defense of marriage and family . " <p> " For us as Christian pastors , this is not about politics but about basic moral principles , " the letter said . <p> The Houston City Council on Wednesday will take up the issue of whether to allow city employees to include same-sex partners on their health insurance . <p> Proponents say domestic-partner benefits are important because they offer equality for homosexuals , who can not legally marry . Opponents offer a variety of arguments , both moral and administrative . Among those is that by giving unmarried gay couples a benefit that unmarried heterosexual couples do not have , the city is equating gay relationships with marriage . <p> Domestic-partner benefits are offered by about 3,500 companies in the United States and seven of the country 's 10 largest cities . The holdouts among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Those that offer the benefits say that while the initial decision was often difficult , the cost has been low and they have encountered no problems with fraud . <p> " The process was more painful than the outcome , " said Linda Seyda , director of human resources for the city of Philadelphia , which adopted same-sex benefits in 1998 . " Since we 've instituted , it 's been so quiet that I have n't opened this file . " <p> Philadelphia , like Houston , estimated that 100 employees might take advantage of the benefits at a cost of about $ 200,000 a year . But only 33 of Philadelphia 's 25,000 employees are using same-sex benefits . <p> In terms of cost , Seyda said , " it really has n't had an impact . " <p> The city of Houston has 23,000 employees . Officials say they do not know how much the benefits will cost because they do not know how many employees will use them . If 100 employees sign up , the cost is estimated at $ 200,000 annually . <p> Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the cost of employee health care will jump by at least $ 24 million next year and by tens of millions more in following years . <p> Also like Houston , Philadelphia officials were concerned that employees would abuse the benefits , falsely claiming domestic partners on their insurance plans . Philadelphia requires employees requesting the benefits to register as same-sex partners and prove financial interdependence to receive the benefits . They can not be married or have been registered in a domestic partnership in the previous six months , and they are required to notify the city if the relationship ends . <p> Seyda said there has been no evidence of fraud . <p> Many of Houston 's major companies also have domestic-partner benefits . <p> Continental Airlines started offering them to flight attendants as part of their contract negotiation last year . The program , which a spokeswoman said " very few " employees have participated in , has been successful enough that last month the Houston-based airline extended the benefits to all 54,000 of its employees . <p> " Our opinion is that the industry standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 've done it from a fairness standpoint . " <p> Continental would not say what the cost to the company is but described it as minimal . The airline requires employees who receive the benefits to sign an affidavit saying they are in a same-sex relationship and have been for a year . <p> J.P . Morgan Chase , which has 5,500 employees in Houston , allows all of its 80,000 employees nationwide to include their spouse , their children and any other adult of their choosing on their health insurance . <p> " Lifestyle and family situations can differ among employees , " spokesman David Byford said . " Our employees are really pleased with this . It 's about making the bank a more diverse workplace . " <p> Another Houston-based company , the Vinson &; Elkins law firm , adopted same-sex benefits several years ago and has been pleased with the outcome . <p> " We felt it was the right thing to do , " managing partner Harry Reasoner said . " We did n't want some of our employees to be suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic-partner benefits has doubled in the last three years , according to a survey of 570 companies conducted by the Hewitt Associates consulting firm . <p> Most companies reported that fewer than 1 percent of their employees opted to use the domestic-partner benefits and that the cost of offering them was less than 1 percent of total benefit costs . <p> Mike Barbour studied domestic-partner benefits for Towers Perrin , another international consulting firm , and said there are sociological reasons for the low participation levels and low costs of providing the benefits . <p> " There are n't a lot of stay-at-home domestic partners . Most of them have coverage elsewhere , " Barbour said . " They tend to be relatively young and childless . " <p> Companies have chosen a variety of ways to design their domestic-partner programs . According to the Hewitt survey , 64 percent offer them to same- and opposite-sex partners . <p> Most require a signed affidavit and notification to the company when the domestic partnership ends . Employees typically can not claim a new domestic partner for six months or a year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic partners as financially interdependent , in an exclusive relationship and living together . A few companies require employees to attest that they are not in the relationship for the sole purpose of obtaining coverage and that they are not merely roommates . <p> Houston 's proposal would require employees to provide proof that they have been living together for at least a year and are financially interdependent , to register as domestic partners , and not to have had another domestic partner in the preceding six months . <p> Three-quarters of the companies offering the benefits reported to Hewitt that the policy helps to attract and retain employees . <p> " Companies want to differentiate themselves in today 's tight labor market , and providing domestic-partner benefits is one way to do that , " said Jennifer Boehm , a Hewitt consultant . " Employers are discovering that the benefits , such as employee loyalty and engagement , far outweigh the costs . " <p> That leads gay activists to charge that conservatives here are not being honest about their objections . <p> Clarence Bagby , a local gay activist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of research into same-sex benefits are just a cover-up for moral objections . <p> " It 's obviously a fallacy to say it has n't been well-researched , " he said . " Clearly , this is a religion issue . " <p> Bagby added that religious discussions should have no role in the workplace . <p> During a debate at City Council last week , another gay activist , Ray Hill , said the significance of adopting same-sex benefits is to show gay employees that they are appreciated . He asked conservative Councilman Bruce Tatro to turn on his microphone and say : " I do not appreciate the service of the gay and lesbian employees . " <p> Tatro laughed at Hill 's suggestion and respectfully declined , saying that is not how he feels . <p> But although Tatro has raised questions about the cost , he did acknowledge in a recent interview that whether to adopt same-sex benefits ultimately comes down to social policy rather than finances . <p> " Legally you are equating partner benefits to marriage , " he said .

They cause meningococcemia when they infect the blood . <p> Currently , the only vaccine available for the bacterial disease in the United States is Menomune , which protects against four of the five strains that cause the illness . <p> It has never been required as a routine childhood vaccination , however , because health authorities say it lasts three years and is ineffective in children under age 2 . <p> A little more than a year ago , Britain became the first nation to add the new vaccine commonly called Men C to its list of routine childhood vaccinations . <p> It provides lifetime protection for all ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meningococcal bacteria - the C strain , said Ceri Griffith of Britain 's Meningitis Research Foundation . <p> However , she said the C strain causes 40 percent of the meningococcal disease in Britain , and no vaccine prevents the B strain , which is responsible for most of the remaining cases . <p> The C strain has been identified as the primary cause of the recent outbreak in the Houston area . More than 80 percent of the 42 meningococcal cases - including five deaths - recorded in Harris County and surrounding counties since October have been linked to that strain . <p> Men C vaccinations in Britain were moved a year ahead of schedule because of similar outbreaks in two areas , Griffith said . <p> Meningococcal cases , she said , were rising since the mid-1990s , reaching a 50-year high of 2,000 cases in 1998 . <p> " The next year , the number of cases jumped to over 3,000 , which is two or three times normal , " Griffith said . " It really foxed us . We did n't know why . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program near the end of the year . " <p> Since then , about 15 million British children have been vaccinated , and officials report an overall 75 percent reduction in meningococcal disease caused by the C strain . The reduction was 90 percent for people age 15 to 17 . <p> Griffith said tabloid press reports of serious reactions to the vaccine were unfounded . <p> For instance , 12 children died shortly after being vaccinated with Men C , but none was the result of the vaccine , said Pam Troop , Britain 's deputy chief medical officer . <p> " Reactions to the vaccine were few and very minor , usually only redness or swelling at the injection site , " Griffith said . <p> Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals , which manufactures Men C under the brand name Meningitec , has not yet applied for approval from the Food and Drug Administration to use the drug in the United States . <p> " We want to develop one with a more beneficial health impact - one that has a combined protection against the C strain , as well as other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokeswoman in St. Davids , Pa . <p> While the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports outbreaks of the C strain occur more frequently in the United States since the early 1990s , that strain still accounts for 30 percent of the annual meningococcal cases . <p> " Ideally , we would want to administer one vaccine that would protect against all the pathogenic strains , " said Jim Sejar of the CDC . " The biggest would be the C , Y and B strains , which cause about 90 percent of all the meningococcal cases we see . " <p> Each of those is blamed for about 30 percent of the meningococcal cases in the United States . <p> " From the reports I 've seen from drug companies , it might be possible to have an effective vaccine on the market against multiple strains of the disease within the next five years , " Sejar said . " It might then be added to the U.S. childhood vaccination list . " <p> In anticipation of a vaccine , Dr. Sheldon Kaplan , chief of infectious diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help coordinate surveillance of meningococcal disease in 10 U.S. hospitals beginning in March . <p> " We want to check the number and serotypes ( strains ) of this organism that are causing invasive illness now , " Kaplan said . " Then , if we have a new vaccine developed , we can see the effect it has after developing a clear baseline . " <p> He said studies also are needed to show whether Men C would be effective in the United States . <p> The new-generation vaccines such as Men C are different from older counterparts in that they can last a lifetime instead of a few years , authorities said . <p> That is because new vaccines are not just made from the coating of the germ , like the older versions , but also are linked to a protein . <p> The new type of vaccine was pioneered in 1990 against the deadly haemophilus influenza type B , once the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children , Kaplan said . <p> " This new vaccine , called Hib , was so successful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Texas Children 's each year . Now , we do n't see any . Many doctors have never even seen a case of it . " <p> Another example , the pneumococcal vaccine , was routinely administered to children for the first time last year . It protects against the pneumococcus bacteria and prevents 90 percent of invasive infections they would cause , such as meningitis , meningococcemia and pneumonia . <p> A recently released study in Finland found that the vaccine has the beneficial side effect of reducing common ear infections in children . <p> Meanwhile , Wyeth-Ayerst also produces the pneumococcal vaccine , called Prevnar , and is trying to combine it with Meningitec into one injection . <p> The company is working to provide more blanket coverage against meningococcal disease by expanding Men C vaccine to cover other major strains such as Y and B. <p> The Chiron Corp . in Emeryville , Calif. , is exploring combining its own Men C vaccine with one that fights the B strain . The firm has an agreement with Norway 's public health authority to use a B vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market now against the B strain . This strain is important because it 's responsible for a third of the meningococcal cases in North America and 60 percent of those cases in Europe , " said Shelly Sneiderman of Chiron . <p> The B strain provides a difficult challenge , Kaplan said , because it has a " molecular structure very similar to brain tissue so that the body does n't recognize it as foreign and wo n't make antibodies to fight it . " <p> Scientists in Norway and Cuba have developed vaccines that were effective against only a small portion of many subgroups that can trigger an infection by the B strain . <p> With advances in mapping the genetic structure of the meningococcal bacteria , scientists discovered new proteins that may be more effective in developing a vaccine against the B strain , Sneiderman said . <p> Kaplan said he hopes to see a vaccine that at least combines protection against the C and A or Y strains in the next three to five years . <p> " A lot of people are vying for health-care dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend money , " he said . <p> Mass inoculations with Menomune were recommended in Conroe , New Caney and Humble after the number of cases surpassed the CDC 's recommended limit . <p> If more than 10 cases per 100,000 population of the same strain occur in an area within three months , the nation 's health authority suggests inoculations to contain the disease , which is spread through direct contact with infected saliva or phlegm . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @56017 <p> Xavier coach Skip Prosser has a bone to pick with those who vote on the weekly basketball polls .

In 1982 , he was appointed to the board of directors , and in 1991 , he became an honorary lifetime director . <p> But it 's his job at the gate that catches most people 's attention . <p> " We 'll be walking around and people will shout : ' Open the gate , Emmett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like he does to most everything , with his calm , slow smile . Not known as a big talker , he might go a little further and reply : " You bet . " <p> " He must be 108 now , " teased Sharon Oliver , who 's on the rodeo 's Special Children 's Committee . " He opened the gate for me when I was a kid at local horse shows . I do n't think the man can stand up without holding onto a gate . Is the man holding the gate up or is the gate holding up the man ? " <p> The next three weeks will be a busy time for the Evanses . On most days , they 're at the rodeo for 12 hours and for special events , like the junior horse show - Mildred Evans is vice chair of the junior quarter horse show - it 's more like 18 . <p> During the weeks prior to the rodeo , the couple try to relax and get more sleep at their Magnolia home in preparation for the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a big vegetable garden to put in , not to mention their rodeo correspondence , the Evans have a full schedule . <p> Still , there 's nothing like those rodeo days . After Evans opens the gate for the Grand Entry , at 7 tonight , he 'll be on duty until the rodeo ends . He opens the gate numerous times during the evening , dipping snuff between duties . <p> It 's never dull by the gate and Evans ' got his memories , though he 's not a storyteller and prefers to live in the present . He does remember the time Dale Evans caught her wig in a microphone . Then there was the night Tennessee Ernie Ford decided to stay behind after the show and swap jokes with the rodeo boys . <p> His favorite calf scramble story happened a few years back when a young boy caught his calf and rode it out of the ring . It was just one of those spur-of-the-moment rodeo experiences . <p> Emmett and Mildred Evans do n't consider themselves cowboys - though they enjoy the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted much of their lives to children , the 4-H and horse shows . <p> Rodeo folks like to say Evans has a " heart of gold " and both are the " salt of the earth . " <p> Evans ' career began when he was 10 and showed a dozen eggs in the Burbank Elementary School 's Future Farmers of America competition . He won a ribbon and that started him off . <p> " I 'll never forget it , " Evans recalled . " School started , and we had a bunch of chickens . I showed the eggs , and it was so exciting when I got second place . " <p> After that he raised everything from chickens , turkeys and ducks to steers , which he showed at Harris and Waller county fairs . <p> In fact , Evans essentially operated a small farm in the back yard of his parents ' city home . In addition to caring for the animals he showed at fairs , he raised turkeys and chickens for sale . <p> " Some kids played a lot of ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High School . " But I was more interested in raising animals . My parents did n't do it , but they were real supportive . " <p> Eventually he began showing his animals at the Houston Fat Stock Show and Rodeo , as the event was then known . When he turned 16 , Evans tried his hand as a calf-scramble boy and had his first real moment of fame . <p> It was 1950 , and only boys could enter the wild and woolly scramble . Those lucky enough to catch a calf got a $ 100 certificate to buy a calf that they would raise and sell the following year . <p> Evans was lucky that night . He was the first over the finish line . <p> " I caught that bugger right quick , " he recalled . <p> When the calf scramble finished , Evans found out that the calf was sponsored by Texas Gov . Alan Shivers , who furnished the money to buy the calf . <p> Evans , Shivers and his new Hereford calf posed in front of the Shamrock Hotel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed in a bulging scrapbook by Evans ' proud mother . <p> During the next year , Evans corresponded with Shivers and kept him posted on his calf 's progress . The following year , the calf was grand champion at the Harris County Fair and brought Evans $ 1,300 . <p> " That was a pocket full of change back then , " Evans recalled . " It was a big thrill . " <p> After the calf-scramble excitement , Evans was hooked on the rodeo . The next year he helped out with the calf scramble and by 1952 , he was on the committee . <p> " I was born in the Orange , Texas , oil fields . My daddy worked for Sun Oil , " Mildred Evans said . " I 'm just a country girl . " <p> The last steer Evans showed at the rodeo was sold to buy an engagement ring . <p> Their life together has been good , they say . They have three sons and six grandchildren . None of their sons were interested in showing farm animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rodeo and drives the fire engine during the the Grand Entry . <p> When the rodeo was held in downtown 's Sam Houston Coliseum , Mildred Evans rode around the arena with the flag and was often in the parade . But those days are behind her now . <p> Instead they both keep busy encouraging other rodeo kids . <p> During the 45 years he worked for Mosier Steel Co. ( now Trinity Industries ) , Evans took vacation to be a rodeo volunteer . Now the retiree has the luxury of time , and he enjoys every minute of it . <p> That was obvious Saturday as the Evanses helped with the Top Hands Horse Show , a competition for physically and mentally disabled children . <p> " It is real rewarding to help the children , " Emmett Evans said . " I do n't mind spending all the time in the world doing it . It makes you realize how fortunate you are . " <p> During the competition , Evans worked the middle of the ring , helping the children line up their horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greeting friends and making jokes . The rodeo is where the usually shy Evans comes alive . <p> Kathy Williams , 46 , gave him a big hug . Williams has known the Evanses since she was 4 and lived next door to them in Spring Branch . This year her daughter Lacey , 16 , will be in the calf scramble . Evans still helps out with it and shows the scramblers how to put the halter on a calf . <p> " He 'll do anything for a kid , " Williams said . " When Lacey was little , she would watch him help kids with the calf scramble and she said : ' Mr. Emmett , I want to do that one day , and you have to teach me . ' " <p> This year , Lacey caught a calf at the Harris County Fair and is ready for her rodeo challenge . <p> " Mr. Emmett , you have to be there , " Lacey said . <p> " You bet , " he replied . <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  ; Biography
