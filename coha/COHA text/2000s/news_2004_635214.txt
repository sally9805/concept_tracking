<p> Dear Carol Slezak : <p> I could n't believe it when I read Carol Slezak 's column ( " ESPYs ' tribute to Tillman will be time to tune out , " July 13 ) . I was very upset that you decided to defame a decorated , courageous , U.S. soldier who died defending this country . In your column you said that you wo n't watch the ESPYs because there will be a tribute to Pat Tillman that probably wo n't include the words , " unjust war , poor widow , what was he thinking . " Unfortunately for you , Ms. Slezak , you have managed to get the facts completely twisted and in the process defame a U.S. soldier who died defending this country . <p> First of all , Tillman was serving in Afghanistan when he was killed and enlisted months after 9/11 . If you believe the war in Iraq is unjust , that is a separate issue . But I certainly hope that you do n't believe the war in Afghanistan is unjust . Because that , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country on 9/11 . <p> As far as your question " What was he thinking ? " I ca n't say for sure , but I 'll take a stab at it . Maybe he was willing to sacrifice millions so he could help defend this great country of ours . Or maybe he wanted to help catch the monsters responsible for 9/11 and help ensure that it never happens again . Quite possibly it was the idea of defending our rights and freedoms , for instance the right to free speech . Tillman sacrificed millions of dollars , a successful career in football and ultimately his life for you and me , and you have the audacity to turn off the TV when his tribute is aired ? No , Ms. Slezak , I think you should leave it on and watch it . Then you might pay tribute to someone who made a difference in this world . <p> There is a cliche that is often overused : " If there were more people like him , the world would be a better place . " This time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kevin Kehoe , Chicago <p> Where do you get off ? <p> Pat Tillman was answering what he felt was a higher calling  --  something nobody has the right to question . Perhaps if you had the courage to answer a higher calling , I would n't have to suffer through this poor excuse of a sports column . <p> Hero , courage , warrior . That 's all you need to say about him . That 's all you need to say about all of them . <p> Jason Gorman , Chicago <p> I 'm guessing this was a desperate attempt to grab readers ' attention to read your column . That was the only logical answer I could come up with after reading it . You ended with the words " remind me not to watch . " I will not be reminding you , but I will remind myself why I can no longer read your columns every time I pick up the newspaper . <p> Jim Mitchell , Oak Forest <p> Dear Jay Mariotti : <p> Lobbying in Washington for a trade association and covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifelong registered Democrat who has given money to the party in the past , Mike Ditka could fit right in with some senators on both sides of the political aisle ( " Sen. Ditka ? Get your mouth shut ! " July 13 ) . <p> As for labeling Ditka in the " buffoon " category with the likes of Jesse Ventura and Arnold " The Terminator , " let 's remember the long line of buffoons in the governor 's mansion with the eager compliance in the Assembly in Sacramento that brought California state government to its bankrupt knees . And for all the hand-wringing by the liberal activitists in my party , Bill Clinton is and probably always will be remembered not for his accomplishments in foreign and domestic politics but for being a buffoon who could n't keep his pants zipped . <p> George Tomek , Edmond , Okla . <p> Do you pay any attention to the behavior of the numerous wackos in today 's Congress ? Career politicians who just recently voted themselves another " cost-of-living raise " while cutting their work schedule from 151 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ditka and several hundred more real Americans , not more lawyers . I really thought that a common-sense guy as yourself would realize that and not take the easy-ridicule-of-Ditka angle . <p> Vic Zvonek , Lincolnwood <p> I am puzzled by Mariotti and other media elites who question Ditka 's qualifications . What exactly makes someone " qualified " to be a U.S. congressman ? Is Ditka any less qualified than the following people : Peter Fitzgerald , Jack Ryan , Bill Bradley  --  all of whom had little or no political experience when they ran for the Senate ? I find it the height of liberal media elitism that people like Ditka and Schwarzenegger are cast as all-flash , no-substance clowns simply because of the arena they made a name for themselves in . <p> Rather than portray Ditka or Schwarzenegger as successful businessmen ( Ditka in restaurants , Schwarzenegger in movies and real estate ) , Mr. Mariotti and others prefer to see them as a football coach and a movie star , who in no way should be allowed to govern . One of the things that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backgrounds can hold elected office . Unlike in France , where one has to go to school to become a public servant , you can have a legislative body that encompasses a former high school wrestling coach ( Dennis Hastert ) and a Yale blue blood ( John Kerry ) . Diversity of opinion and , more importantly , background , is the foundation of this country . If we subscribe to the idea that no one is qualified to hold public office if they come from a background that traditionally is not a bridge to politics , this country can very quickly lose its sense of identity . <p> Matt Rogina , Oak Park <p> Dear Rick Telander : <p> In regards to your column on Mark Prior 's injury ( " Not even in Cubs ' worst nightmare , " July 17 ) , calm down . <p> Like you said , it 's a five-man rotation , not one . <p> Glendon Rusch has been doing just fine as a starter , arguably even better than Maddux . <p> The Yankees have had a so-so rotation racked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The remaining games on the schedule have not been canceled . <p> We 'll get through it . <p> Seth Kerney , Chicago <p> Dear Greg Couch : <p> I doubt that many NASCAR fans will agree or appreciate your comments regarding last Sunday 's race ( " Stewart antics , NASCAR 's approval are no accident , " July 12 ) . I was offended by some of the comments in your column . It makes me sad , being a southerner , that NASCAR is considering another race date for Chicagoland . The money generated by a race is not chump change . There are MANY race fans who do n't like taking our sport out of the south . Two historic tracks have lost or will lose all of their dates to tracks outside the southeast . I 'm sorry if you do not care for our form of racing , but I bet you sure do like the dollars generated by it . While I can appreciate that everyone is entitled to his own opinions , I hope that there are not too many like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia E. Senter , Canton , Miss . <p> E-mail letters to our columnists to inbox@suntimes.com . Please include your full name , hometown and a daytime phone number .
