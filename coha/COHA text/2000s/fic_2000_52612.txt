ON THE TOP OF MY great-great-grandfather John Lane 's limestone grave-marker , erected in eastern North Carolina in 1868 , is a set of carved hands grasped in friendship . Who is this patriarchal John Lane shaking hands with  --  God ? If I think of my paternal family line extending toward the present , he is shaking hands with his son , George Washington , who in turn shakes hands with his son , Robert Preston , who shakes hands with his son , who in due time takes my infant hand at my birth in 1954 . <p> It 's a good line , though a short one . Five men standing side to side . A genealogist friend has traced one branch of his family back to three English kings , another back to Charlemagne . He is childless , like me , but he 's still hoping . He dates young women approaching thirty who still have the certainty of family written all over them like an alphabet . <p> I was once briefly married , and I 've disappointed the family dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend the genealogist , I 've fallen in love with the idea that my family history is a story , and I am at the end of it . I am not some minor character wandering the middle acts where things get complicated , waiting for the king to show . I am a climax , of sorts . I am a writer , a scratcher of crooked lines . Instead of a child , I leave a legacy of paper , a canceled check on my branch of the bank of Lane . <p> I am also an inept historian , a poor genealogist , and sloppy with the facts . I make mistakes recording names and dates , and jump to rash conclusions . I quickly grow bored in archives . Rather than accepting the blessed assurance that raw data gives a good researcher , I doodle on the corners of my notepad while I should be recording long successions of rare tax records only available in state libraries . I should look for provable nuance and lead , but when given a choice between certainty and speculation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed breadcrumbs . Even with my short line , the family the writer in me invents is more interesting than the one safely filed away in the creases of historic record . <p> When I wander down my father 's family line , I have a powerful sense that I am headed not out of the dark forest , toward certainty and safety , but deeper into uncertainty . Writers find comfort in the murky and unasked-for provisions of the unknown . <p> Meditation pulls me back again and again to Greene County , North Carolina , where my father 's blood has always pooled . The drainage is slow there ; people , like water , tend to creep along , occasionally catch in a depression , and turn dark with one stain or another . Greene County is flat coastal plain tending gradually toward the Atlantic , less than one hundred miles away . " That 's the middle of nowhere , " a friend once said when I pointed it out on a road map . <p> Greene County is perfect land for farming  --  which is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's an occupation that makes a deep impact on the land , but most farmers do n't leave much of a paper trail , except for deeds , wills , and , on larger plantations , ledger books . You could take all the records I 've found of my line 's five generations in the county and not fill a medium lockbox in my local bank . <p> Maybe the trail is there , though . I 've never followed the research checklist given me by my genealogist friend : I have n't located the family Bible yet ; there are letters left unread ; I 've only done a few interviews ; I 've never visited the county courthouse and sorted through birth certificates , marriage records , wills , estates , deeds , mortgages ; I 've tracked down only a few cemetery logs , county histories , tax lists , newspaper articles , voter rolls ; I 've spent one weekend in the state archives looking for the land grants , census , and militia records , but I have n't been back . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absences that bother me  --  the missing names , dates , and marriages  --  it is not the hope for more information stringing me deeper into the past that stalls me , makes me brood . Instead I 'm overwhelmed by what I do have , by the presences already known to me . When I look back over the traceable line  --  almost two hundred years  --  I see great-great-grandfather John ( b. 1802-d. 1868 ) and his six children ; great-grandfather George Washington ( b. 1828-d. 1907 ) with his seven ; grandfather Robert Preston ( b. 1871-d. 1963 ) with eleven ; and my father John Edward ( b. 1915-d. 1959 ) with only me ( b. 1954 ) . A meditation on this legacy is like looking at the intricate syntax of a Faulknerian sentence , each generation a complex clause , and then realizing that I am the period . <p> If I do prove to be that period , then maybe my father can be seen as the verb . The action word . The motivating premise . My picture of him is assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stories from people who knew him , and my own stifled memory . My father , as he comes back to me ( I was five when he died ) , is still full of surprises , both mine field and garden . It was n't until I was in my twenties , going through his old wallet one day , that I realized he was five-six . I am six-two . Minefield or garden ? <p> I had a picture of my father displayed over my desk at college . He was smiling , in a head-and-shoulder shot , wearing a field jacket and helmet liner . It was taken somewhere in Europe during World War II . 1942 or ' 43 . The liner sits at an angle , and a shadow falls like a woolen hat across his upper forehead . One day I noticed my father 's teeth  --  something that simple . They were sharp and a little crooked , not at all like my own . I searched the photograph for some clue to his suicide , his past , and the way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would my father look like with a beard , one like his son had worn since his first years of college ? <p> One day I went through a shoebox where , for years , I 'd stored a few of my father 's things , mostly war souvenirs . I unfolded an old map he 'd brought back . Around the edge of a sketch of Sicily were eight names written in faded , forty-year-old ink , each in the hand of a stranger who was in the engineers with him : men from Waycross , Georgia ; Valhalla , New York . <p> I tried to call the men who 'd signed it . I chose a name at random , Michael Cohen . I reached directory assistance for New York and asked for Valhalla , then asked for Michael Cohen . <p> " We do n't have a Michael Cohen in Valhalla . " My heart drifted down . Of course they would not . It had been forty years . There was a silent moment . " But we do have a Michael Cohen in Russet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number and called . <p> " Yes , this is Michael Cohen . Yes , I was in the First Army in World War II . No , no , I do n't remember anyone by that name . " Then the voice on the other end warmed up a little and began to talk more openly . He had been a lieutenant in the Engineering Unit . They 'd seen action in every major European campaign  --  North Africa , Sicily , Italy , Normandy , the Battle of the Bulge  --  and they were mustered out in Czechoslovakia at the end of the war . I knew that my father had been an enlisted man . I read Mr. Cohen the rest of the names . There was one he recognized , the boy from Waycross , Georgia . <p> " He was one hell of a poker player . I lost a bunch of my pay to him . And there was another southern boy who was his friend . He was a good player too . Those southern boys were good at cards . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other connections . <p> I finally showed the map to my mother . She shook her head . " I ca n't imagine your father asking those men to sign , " she said . " He must have been tight . " <p> My mother says when she met my father in 1947 he was always tight , downing a quart of whiskey a day . He worked his job at the service station despite this . His brothers have told me that no one ever remembers seeing him unable to function because of drinking . <p> " How can a man drink a quart of whiskey a day ? " I asked an alcoholic once . <p> " It 's easy . You get up in the morning and you bubble about eight ounces , " he explained . " And then you sneak off midmorning and bubble about five more . Then at lunch you bubble eight more , and then mid-afternoon some more . When your shift 's over , you can go home and start the serious drinking until you pass out . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for my father 's grave . My grandfather is buried in the same cemetery , and I found his grave with no problem , safe among a clan of Lanes  --  cousins , brothers , my grandmother . But at first I could n't locate the flat military-service plaque that marked my father 's resting place . I remembered him being buried in a solitary plot on the town side of the cemetery , and a cousin who was with me remembered it being farther toward the woods . <p> We finally found him near the trees . It was the third or fourth time as an adult I had visited my father 's grave . I thought of the strange , drifting line that would trail behind me over the landscape of Greene County if I were to walk from my father 's grave to my grandfather 's , then hike three miles down the road to the small family cemetery where my great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather are buried . Four graves , not really in a line . The line is only in my imagination . <p> Faulkner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even past . He knew we do n't stand in a line . It 's more like a circle , and anyone , at any time , can be the center . Family stories make the sentence of our lives present tense . <p> When someone asks why I 've chosen not to extend the family line , I often avoid the question with an answer of another sort : " I 'm leaving behind six or seven cubic feet of paper  --  published and unpublished books , letters , manuscripts , journals  --  in an archive somewhere . That will be my only claim on history . " <p> Occasionally , when intimacy has softened the edges of a conversation , I 'll offer a more complex answer , an explanation approaching confession : Fear has kept me childless  --  the fear of failing as a father , fear of commitment , fear that I would abandon a child , or fail to provide , much as my father did . <p> My commitment has been directed to craft , to career . I have file cabinets full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty years . I understand that many people balance marriage , children , and work . But I have made a choice : silence , space , and imagination over noise , clutter , and reality . Growing anything takes care and time , and I 've always wondered : If I put the time and care into growing children , what would happen to my prose , my sheaf of poems , my reading room , my publication shelf ? Some would call it the most selfish of choices . <p> But it is mine . A friend claims it is a peculiar male thing to think of one 's accomplishments in lengths  --  a short shelf of publications in my case  --  but that does n't stop me . I walk into my living room from time to time and glance at my shelf the way a father checks a sleeping child . <p> Last Christmas I began to photocopy the first ten years of my journal , handwritten in a variety of spiral notebooks and bound books . I wanted two copies in case of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of copying the most recent ten years , a period of longwinded reflection , speculation , and quotidian accounting . The accumulated journal could run to twenty thousand pages . I 've never completely understood why I maintain this odd discipline . Sometimes a poem will emerge , or a story fragment , but not often . I do n't read back through with deep interest or regularity , either , but the journal grows like an embryo within the body of my daily experience . <p> Fifteen years ago , before I had a house of my own ( or a publication shelf ) , I was in my mother 's attic sorting through my already growing stack of documents . My sister Sandy , a woman who mistrusts paper clutter and clears her house of its accumulation once a year , was with me . She shook her head and smiled as I ordered and filed personal letters , carbons of my answers , and unpublished manuscripts . " What makes you so sure anyone will care that you kept all this ? " she asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer her now : I knew , even then , that someone would care because I care . There will always be people like me who search the scraps of the past for insights into the present and future . Even then I understood that I was n't assuring the world I " mattered " so much as confirming that reflection matters , craft matters , writing matters . I believe my need for those cubic feet of paper in some archive is a creature-need , strong and healthy as the drive to procreate . I am a pack rat , adding my layer of confirming refuse  --  drafts , letters , and journals  --  to the human nest . <p> I knew from early on that it was not a question of greatness or fame ; if not famous , I would at least be obsessively documented . Few people commit to such a task : keep every letter , draft , rejection slip . " Live in the layers , " Stanley Kunitz has said . <p> My father 's sister Eula was the sibling of his whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the present , the neighborhood gossip , and news of nearby cousins . I spent every summer after my father 's suicide with Aunt Eula in Snow Hill , the seat of Greene County . It was a childhood of sweet corn and tobacco barns . In the 1960s , it was still agricultural , though that was soon to be past . <p> Aunt Eula did write a few short letters on pink stationery that kept me informed about my father 's people . She sent money too , ten or twenty dollars for Christmas or on my birthday . When I visited the family farms , she saw to it that my uncles told stories to fill in the missing pages , how my father had driven a school bus to be his own man , how he 'd been the first in the county to enlist in the army . I listened and remembered . <p> In 1988 , a few years before Aunt Eula died , I was visiting her , reading in her sunny den . I saw a reference to a " Lane House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mentioned what the book described : the abandoned plantation house , the family graveyard under a huge sycamore . " What about this big house ? " I asked . " It says it 's the oldest home in the county . " <p> " That 's the old Lane place , " she answered . <p> " What old Lane place ? I thought the house where you and Daddy were born is the old Lane place . " <p> " No , that house was built by my granddaddy , G. W. Lane . That 's the old Lane place , " she said , pointing to the picture . " It 's in the Jones tobacco field . The old Lane cemetery is there , " she said matter-of-factly . <p> That May afternoon , in a downpour , we drove into the middle of a tobacco field and explored my ancestral home for the first and only time . My mother and aunt sat in the car , uninterested . I went into the doorless house with my sister Sandy and took pictures , walked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . No one had stolen the original mantels . Someone had scrawled " Race Masters " with spray paint on the old plaster walls . Upstairs , the house had closets , which seemed a rarity in the eighteenth or nineteenth century . <p> Hay had been stored in the downstairs rooms , but the floors were still solid , and some original windows were still in the panes . The house , which the Greene County history dated as mid-1700s , was well-preserved ; we would find out later from Mr. Vernon Jones , whose family owned it , that the house had been abandoned for forty years . It had been over a century , I would discover , since a Lane lived there . <p> It was still raining hard when my sister and I left the house . Though it was late , I was pulled toward the old cemetery . The fence was in ruins , and some of the headstones had fallen . " I want to see what those stones at the center say , " I told my sister . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackberry canes . I pushed them aside with a broken tobacco stick and saw two markers : John Lane , dead in 1868 , and Mary Lane , 1865 . I was stunned . There was my name , and the name of my mother . I went to the car and pulled out paper and pencil as my mother and aunt waited ; they still were wholly uncurious . My sister helped me keep off the rain as I sketched the layout of every standing stone . <p> They say the Mormons store their genealogical records in a deep cave in the Utah desert . When I visit family cemeteries , I daydream of visiting that cave and riding the elevator down into reamed-out bedrock to see a million names with birth and death dates , the ones the Mormons have secretly carved into stone to preserve , to assure their survival . It is survival I want most : for someone to say , a hundred , two hundred years from now , " That was his life . That 's the way he lived back then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet I 'm still walking graveyards , searching . <p> When Aunt Eula died in 1992 , we cleaned out her house . I was looking for a cache of letters from my father . But Aunt Eula was like my sister , and her house had been carefully cleared of the past . Her mail was answered , then thrown away . <p> In our culture a direct line of descent runs through the fathers . The family name is the father 's name . Genealogy tables are set up this way : a " family tree , " it 's called , and the men are definitely the trunk . Women , such as Aunt Eula  --  childless herself  --  are always just to the side of the direct line , peopling a family but not extending its name . A line continues from father to son ; daughters marry and carry on someone else 's line . But it is only through the women that true descent can be traced , descent in the scientific sense . Nuclear DNA , that which is passed on by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it divides and divides and divides like a farm carved up in wills ; but mitochondrial DNA is passed on from mother to mother whole . The father 's nuclear DNA does not interest scientists solving a family mystery dating back several generations . It 's a gamble , not a sure thing . <p> In 1997 , as the June heat was beginning to build , I arrived in Wilson , North Carolina , for a visit with my father 's eighty-three-year-old first cousin , Jenny Wooten . The winter before , Jenny had written me a note ( now filed in my cabinet ) saying , " All the old ones are gone . They 've even torn down the old house . Come to see me . " Jenny Wooten is spry . She remembers things and articulates them . Several months before my arrival she had moved from the house on Kincaid Street where she lived for seventy-three years . It was built by her father , my grandfather 's brother , Zebalon Baynard Lane , on the outskirts of Wilson , a farming center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country around it , and even Jenny has left central Wilson for a condominium in a retirement village on the outer edge of the present sprawl , which could be anywhere . Jenny told us that the young couple who bought her home had remodeled it already . Soon it would be forgotten as a " Lane house , " she worried . <p> Jenny 's living room is full of heirlooms . This was your great-aunt Angeline 's melodeon , " she said , leaning lightly against the small piano , its keys covered by a dark mahogany panel . Then she told me about my father . They were born less than a month apart , in 1915 , and she remembers him being " melancholy , " even as a boy . Jenny complained that her grasp of language was fading ; she complained as someone who had taught English and spent her life among books . But this time she had the perfect word , and she repeated it : " melancholy . " I liked her use of that word , like something out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melancholic . It placed him for me in a huge , spiraling family of Lanes that I 've always had trouble keeping straight . <p> Jenny pulled out a file folder in which she had John and G. W. Lane 's original wills , encased in plastic . She placed them on the dining-room table . " Read them out loud , " she said . John Lane had set his last will and testament down on August 8 , 1868 . He was " somewhat feeble in health but of sound disposing mind and memory , " and the document was witnessed by his two sons , George and Joseph . His three daughters are well provided for ; he leaves them over four hundred acres of land and the big house , and he " desires it that if either of my above named daughters shall mary and leave two other single that the married one Shall not draw the house and lot where in the dwelling stands so that it may remain a home for the two single ones . " Where I could not read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded or the handwriting obscure , I filled in the gaps . <p> Cousin Jenny told me that the big house had been torn down . " Sold to a furniture maker in Scotland Neck , " she said . She 'd paid that artisan to craft a small bookshelf from pine floorboards pulled from the old house , and she brought it out for me to see . I felt sad and full of grief . The shelf had a small gold plaque with " The Lane House " engraved in script . It seemed such a diminishment , merely a sanded fragment of the two-hundred-year-old dwelling , the old nails clipped clean , the heart-pine grain swirling like flame through the varnished surface . <p> She had the man 's number , and I told her I wanted a bed made from the old beams . Jenny encouraged me , handed me the phone . When I called , the furniture maker cleared up some things about the house : Yes , its unusual closets were original , a rarity in those days ; the floor joists had powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were intact . Its age ? " There were no handmade nails , so the house was built sometime from the 1790s to the late teens . " <p> Could he make a bed ? I asked . " I 'll send you some plans . The wood has been put to good use , " he said . " The handrail from the entry hall went to a beautiful house in Wilson , in eight pieces . " When he 'd finished salvaging what wood he could use , he piled the scraps with a front-end loader and burned them . <p> Is n't it enough to walk in an old family house , to discover a family cemetery , to see back over one hundred years to a namesake 's handwriting , to catch one 's name meandering toward the present from the past in stories told by an old cousin , to have a bed made from salvaged beams ? I have never believed so ; I would answer no , it is n't enough . There should be someone to write it all down . Too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reasoned into a story to stop at visits , conversations , casual experiences . <p> But the living mistrust paper trails , and the dead have nothing to say . Whom do we honor ? I think we honor the dead , and maybe writing is their realm . " Remember me , " the ghost of Hamlet 's father says . When I took my first teaching job , the English department chair walked me around the campus and said , " If I have any advice it is that you can say anything you want to anybody here , but never write anything down . " I 'm the end of a line , and to give up writing all this down would be to give up on the past . <p> I am not a farmer of facts or land . I do n't trust the percentages . I play the long odds . I am not what one of my gay friends calls a " breeder boy . " Though heterosexual , I have no children , no progeny . My genetic bank account is closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Call it choice ; call it a deep wound ; call it a family fear wide as the Cape Fear River . It 's probable there will be no direct descendant figuring out the same information I lose my way in  --  who begat who begat who begat whom . No trail will lead up to my genetic dooryard . There will be a closed door with a cliff dropping off behind it . <p> Sometimes it feels so foolhardy . Instead of raising children , I raise the past onto the mantel of the present . For me , to trust stories means to worry notebooks and tapes and random childhood details into words . It is what I do instead of breed . I am a son who has no son , writing about a father and his father and his father and his father . This dark line trails off the page , but it comes as close as I ever will get to continuing the family tradition . <p> <p> By John Lane <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
