Eminem Relapse 3 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE RAP Clearly , the pressure was on Eminem to deliver his first studio album since 2004 's multiplatinum Encore . " Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your f --  --  --  vacation ? " asks a record exec on one skit . But Slim Shady has n't been kicking back on a private island . He 's been battling some serious demons , namely an addiction to prescription pills that he raps about throughout Relapse . " I fall in bed with a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobble head , " he rhymes on the witty , whimsical " My Mom . " ( " My mom loved valium and lots of drugs , " the chorus goes . ) Em takes a more sobering approach on the confessional " Dj Vu , " breaking down an overdose in gripping detail . Even more chilling are tales of serial killers ( " 3 a.m. " ) and child-molesting stepfathers ( " Insane " ) , with Dr. Dre back supplying the menacing beats . Mandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope , Mandy Moore gave up trying to compete with the Britney Spears types and joined the coffeehouse crowd . She keeps up the musical makeunder on these country- and folk-tinged tunes . The low-key Amanda Leigh ( Moore 's real name ) delivers on modest pleasures like " Love to Love Me Back , " which evokes early Olivia Newton-John . But you keep wishing she had even a smidge of new hubby Ryan Adams ' edge .

Instead , he leaves much of the writing and production to contemporary hitmakers like Akon , The-Dream and Stargate , who put a fresh but familiar spin on Richie 's sound . Still , the old guy falls into a bit of a midtempo rut .

Actually , though , the MVB played on last year 's Conor Oberst . On Outer South , however , Oberst shares songwriting duties and even lead vocals with his band . Guitarist Taylor Hollingsworth , for instance , delivers the frisky , ' 60s-spiked pop of " Air Mattress . " Elsewhere , the MVB puts some more muscle behind Oberst on " Roosevelt Room , " one of the rockingest things the alt-folkie has done . But while this group effort is consistently good , Oberst , by any designation he wants to use , is capable of better .

VINCENT Actor As St. Vincent , Annie Clark acts in multiple roles : singer , songwriter and multi-instrumentalist . With her cinematic vision -- and a theatricality Rufus Wainwright would applaud -- her chamber pop plays well to the art-house set . 3 stars CAGE THE ELEPHANT Cage the Elephant Boasting both a rootsy grit and a hip-hop swagger , these bluesy rockers find the missing link between Kings of Leon and Kid Rock . This is what the Chili Peppers might sound like if they came out of Kentucky . 3 stars JULIAN MARLEY Awake On his smooth if unspectacular third disc , the reggae scion keeps the family legacy intact with a little help from brothers Stephen Marley and Damian " Jr .
