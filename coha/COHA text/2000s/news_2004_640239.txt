<p> Once , as a defensive lineman at the University of Miami , he backed up stars . Now Dwayne ' The Rock ' Johnson is one himself . The Rock has championship wrestling belts , leading acting roles in ' The Mummy Returns ' and ' The Scorpion King ' , and he stars in ' Walking Tall ' , which opens Friday . Last week , The Rock went to the mat with us . Adam Schefter : Do we call you Dwayne or Rock ? The Rock : Dwayne 's fine , man . That 's cool . Or Rock . AS : OK , Rock , for all the punishment you took in ' Walking Tall , ' what was most painful ? TR : Probably the end fight scene with myself and Neal McDonough . When you 're in a fight like that , with an ax involved , and a big piece of wood involved , it was deep , down , dirty and on the grind . And at times , he was swinging a real ax but it was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to chop off my limb . I had a ton of bruises , cuts all over the place . But the cuts did n't necessarily come from the ax . The cuts came from banging into the tree , the fall down the hill . Then there 's a scene at the end , without giving the movie away , when he spits in my face . That 's no camera trick . He had to spit on me about 15 different times . AS : Ever gotten spit on before in wrestling ? TR : Usually in wrestling , it 's one take . If someone 's going to spit on me , it 's one time , and then that 's it . Then they get a fresh ( butt ) whooping coming . AS : Hardest you 've ever been hit ? TR : One time when I was in junior high , I stayed after school to fight this guy that was in high school . It was over something stupid , as most fights are . It was in his neighborhood , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , and it was a pretty even fight , they were all dropping the bombs on The Rock . Got my ( butt ) whopped . I 've probably never been hit as many times or as hard as I was hit then . Coming in a close second was when I told my wife , ' Get me a sandwich with no cheese , ' and I forgot to say please . She caught me with that right cross . AS : In ' Walking Tall , ' do you say , ' You 're fired ' more often than Donald Trump ? TR : With a little less over-the-topness . AS : Is there more acting in the movies or wrestling ? TR : There 's obviously a lot more acting involved in wrestling because it 's on a higher level and a different degree . But I 've always said that the best acting you see in wrestling is always once the match is over and everybody 's backstage . That 's where you 're trying to convince people of what you want to do . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're trying to convince people that if I can write my own dialogue , it might be better . AS : Rather win a wrestling championship or an Academy Award ? TR : Well I 've won seven wrestling championships , so I 'd like to throw my hat into the ring for the Academy Awards . And I will say this : There was small talk about a Golden Globe for this next role that I 'm doing with John Travolta and Uma Thurman , a comedy called ' Be Cool ' that will be out in February . But I was like , ' OK , we 'll see . ' And my acceptance speech will be the quickest speech in the history of film . AS : And what would that be ? TR : It would be ' thank you all for coming out , thank you for everything , God bless and good night . ' AS : Any actor you 've studied ? TR : For me , I 've always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood . Just that type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( butt ) when he had to kick ( butt ) . He was a reluctant hero , if you will , in a lot of his movies . And he was n't afraid at times to poke fun at himself , to give himself up for the joke . AS : Which person at the 35th annual NAACP Image Awards made the largest impact on you ? TR : Hands down , Ray Charles . It was his moment , his night . When you get a guy like Ray Charles and you go through chronologically the things he has done , what 's impressive is that he never veered away from what he really wanted to do with his music , and he always kept it true . That 's why his music has resonated over years and years . And by the way , he was 16 , and on his own , and blind . AS : If you could take that block of wood from ' Walking Tall ' and smack any athlete , who would it be ? TR : I 'd have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hockey . But a sucker punch will always be a sucker punch to me . When I played football at the University of Miami , we would fight all the time . But every time we fought , I made sure I was in front of you and you knew where the punch was coming from . AS : Most talented teammate you had on your football team at Miami ? TR : A tie between Warren Sapp and Ray Lewis . Warren Sapp could completely take over a game . And my best memory of Ray Lewis is when we were playing at Colorado and Michael Barrow went down with an injury . Ray Lewis had to step in as a true freshman . Eighteen years old . Ran the defense . Took control of the huddle . Won player of the game with 18 solo tackles . And ever since then , never lost his starting job . AS : Do Sapp and Lewis come to your movie premiers ? TR : Those are my boys , I talk to them all the time . I always invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last time we all hooked up was at the Super Bowl this past year . We hang out and we look back and just laugh because none of us had any money in college . And a lot of times , I 'll call up Warren and just leave him this goofy message and say , ' Hey , by the way , thanks for beating me out . ' Then I hang up the phone . Because he actually beat me out of my position at Miami . AS : Now that you know what has gone on , do you wish the University of Colorado had recruited you ? TR : No , because we got in enough trouble down at Miami . Man , we broke every recruiting law you could possibly imagine , which eventually led to them going on probation . AS : What scares you ? TR : All right , man , I 've got to tell you this . Those ( darn ) spiders . They 're the worst ! Do n't get me wrong , it 's not like I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see a spider , I have to get the big towel , I have to stomp on it about 15 times , and I have to make sure it 's dead . AS : Last time you cried ? TR : A long time ago , I saw this movie called ' Beaches . ' AS : What is The Rock doing seeing ' Beaches ? ' TR : Yeah , it was a long time ago , I was a kid , and what can I say ? There was a lot of pollen in the air . AS : How did it feel to have your book climb to No. 1 on the New York Times Bestsellers list ? TR : I did that almost missing the experience , if you will . I went into that project and I thought , ' Well , maybe some people might be interested in the life that I 've already had . ' But I had no idea that it was going to turn into what it turned into . It was an honor . What an honor . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , ' How does it feel to know that you 've outsold the Dalai Lama ? ' I said , ' Well , the Dalai Lama is not the people 's champ . ' AS : Of all you 've accomplished , what has surprised you most ? TR : This sounds kind of corny , but I look at my daughter , Simone , and think , ' Wow , what an accomplishment . ' For people out there who talk about babies , now I understand . It 's funny because it 's almost like the circle comes around now . Before I had the baby , you get on the phone with your parents , your mom or your dad , and you 're like , ' C'm on , ma , I got ta go ! I got ta get off the phone ! ' They always want to keep you on the phone . Then you have a baby and all you want to do is spend time with the baby . And 15 years from now , I know it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , ' C'm on , dad , I got ta go ! I got ta get off the phone ! '
