Computers have come a long way from the dull beige box . The new Disney Dream Desk PC for kids is bright blue with yellow accents ; the speakers are Mickey Mouse ears perched atop a flat-screen monitor . The coolest application is a game called Disney 's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding , in which Goofy skateboards underwater and performs all sorts of spins and slides . There are also Disney-themed programs for mixing your own music , creating digital videos and drawing pictures . Kids can use Microsoft Works for homework and can safely surf the Net , thanks to the ContentProtect Internet filtering program . Built by the European PC maker Medion , the $599 PC ( plus $299 for the 14.1-in. monitor ) features a 2.66 GHz Intel Celeron processor , a 40-GB hard drive , 256 MB of memory and a CD burner . And there 's an array of matching accessories , including a 1.3-megapixel digital camera ( $79 ) and a game controller ( $19 ) .                 @ @ @ @
