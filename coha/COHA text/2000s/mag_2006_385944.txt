All of a sudden , videos are all over the Web . Here 's how to find them and watch them anywhere , whether on your PC , TV , or mobile device . // APPLE SAYS IT has sold over 30 million videos through its iTunes Store since October 2005 . That 's impressive . But YouTube , currently the most popular site for sharing amateur video , claims to serve up 100 million video viewings each day . That 's stupefying . These days , everything from Hollywood films and TV shows to clips from ordinary users is available right in your browser . Even cell phones are in on the act , with news , sports , and lots of short video segments just a dial away . But although video options are proliferating at an astonishing pace , problems persist , including format incompatibility across platforms , license restrictions on content , and-still-a limited selection of good videos . Following is your guide to surfing the new video wave , with tips for viewing movies on your PC and on the go , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEMAND , THE WEB WAY YOU COME HOME tired and eager to watch a film or a TV show . Trudging over to the video store or waiting for Netflix is out , and Arrested Development was cancelled . So you turn to the mother lode of all media , the Web . You should be able to find what you want there , right ? You have a lot of options these days , from TV shows and short films on sites like iTunes or Google Video to movies on CinemaNow or Movielink ( see chart ) . Such sites make it easy to watch films on a laptop or PC , or perhaps a mobile player ( without illegally ripping a DVD ) . And of course , you never have to leave home to get the film , or worry about returning it . The challenge remains finding material that is worth watching and that approaches the kind of image quality you 're used to-and that is better or cheaper than what 's on your home recorder , or what you can get from Netflix or Amazon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloads of new and old films and videos . A standard film runs around 1GB and costs $1 to $4 to view for 24 hours from the first viewing . The Starz-sponsored Vongo , which also provides movies , lets you have unlimited downloads and viewing for $10 per month ; the other sites , however , get new movies months earlier than Vongo does , and Vongo 's list of available titles changes frequently , just like cable , so a movie there one week may be gone the next . With broadband service , you can start watching a movie soon after it begins downloading , though the file transfer may take an hour or three to complete . To be safe , wait 10 to 15 minutes to begin viewing ; I had occasional problems when playback caught up with the download . Images are worse-than-DVD quality , and you may have to watch the film with the service 's own player , and be restricted to viewing it on the PC you download to . The selection of titles can charitably be described as mixed , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compared with the 60,000 titles on Netflix , each online site offers a small array of titles . Even a typical independent video store has more titles-for now . Selection and quality should improve . Many industry experts believe online services will inevitably become the primary form of video delivery-even Netflix has discussed plans for a download service . MUST-SEE NET TV MOST MAJOR NETWORKS and producers make some recent and archival TV shows available through their own Web sites , as well as on iTunes , AOL 's In2TV , Google Video , and others . Each site may offer only a few shows from one or two studios . For example , CinemaNow carries just two series , one season each of Babylon 5 and The Dukes of Hazzard. iTunes carries about 150 series from Disney/ABC , NBC , and MTV , including current shows like Law &; Order and The Office . Network shows typically cost $2 to $4 per episode . A growing body of content is viewable for free , with the revenue coming from commercials . As a trial , ABC released free downloads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after they aired , with ads . Google Video , too , is experimenting a bit with ad-supported video . AOL 's ad-supported In2TV presents many old Warner Brothers shows , such as Max Headroom and The People 's Court , with new ads . Increasingly , you see well-produced , original Web content , as well . For example , both CBS 's Innertube ( www.cbs.com/innertube ) and MTV Overdrive ( www.mtv.com/overdrive ) offer clips from broadcast shows along with online-only reality , talk , and magazine shows . ABCnews.com , NBC , and others present free nightly newscasts along with single-story videos . Some local stations have good content , too : Check out southwest Florida 's Studio 55 , which has a high-quality , daily news video podcast at naplesnews.com/studio55 . However , most free programs play as Flash Video ( . flv ) files on the provider 's site-no easy downloads for offline viewing . And you ca n't subscribe to or watch content from all sites with one viewer . Although Blinkx.tv and Yahoo both offer improving Web-wide video search , no one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial and sharing sites searchable in one place . Also , with today 's broadband , high-def video takes too long to download , and content is scarce . ( If you want to try HD , CinemaNow does have 80 titles . ) Moreover , unless your PC is connected to your TV , you have few ways to easily bring Web content to your living room . TiVo 's TiVoCast ( www.tivo.com ) and Akimbo ( www.akimbo.com ) offer two of the few alternatives : Each service downloads videos from partner sites to its set-top box for TV viewing . TiVoCast has launched with ten partners , such as iVillage and the New York Times , while Akimbo has 100 partners , with video ranging from A &E's; biography and history shows to short movies from iFilm to clips from the Karaoke Channel . Most commercial content providers currently avoid distributing their libraries via RSS feeds and peer-to-peer , presumably due to concerns about file trading . However , Warner Brothers ' agreement with P-to-P developer BitTorrent to use its technology to sell and distribute movies and shows suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE GO WITH THE RIGHT gear , your favorite shows , movies , and video clips can accompany you wherever you go . Mobile video devices come in two categories : lightweight players such as the Apple iPod , Creative Zen , and Sony PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) , onto which you download content from your computer or the Web ; and video-capable cell phones that pull in prepackaged clips of news , sports , and other short content . You 'll find a wider selection of material-and slightly better video quality-with the players , but phones offer fresher content . PREPPED TO PLAY THE IPOD AND PSP have the most market share and thus have the broadest support from tool developers and content providers . In addition to the iTunes Store and the 250 films on PSP-compatible 2.5inch UMDs ( Universal Media Disc ) , inexpensive programs such as MoviePod ( $10 ) and PSPWare ( $15 ) , both from Nullriver ( www.nullriver.com ) , provide drag-and-drop batch conversion of common video files into clips compatible with iPods or PSPs , and then automatically download the files to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Google Video , for example , has downloadable iPod and PSP versions of the free videos on its site . Even CinemaNow , a movie download site partly financed by Microsoft , has hinted at possible future support for iPod and PSP . Want an easy way to receive RSS video feeds for your iPod or PSP ? FireAnt ( www.fireant.tv ) , Videora ( www.videora.com ) , and soon Democracy Player ( www.getdemocracy.com ) each can find , download , convert , and sync RSS video feeds to these mobile devices , not just to your PC . FireAnt is currently the most evolved , and it integrates Yahoo video searching , but Democracy Player has a lot of potential . All three are as easy to use as a typical RSS news reader . Apple and Sony are n't the only players in town . Palm Desktop , which is bundled with all Palm OS devices , includes Quicklnstall , an app that can perform drag-and-drop conversion of many types of video for playback on the handheld . The open-source Core Pocket Media Player ( www.tcpmp.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows Mobile , and other devices ( though not the iPod ) play a wide range of popular video files . Windows Media devices have less downloadable video available than iPods and PSPs do , with CinemaNow the main commercial source for films . But you can use Windows Media Player 10 or 11 to convert several video formats into files compatible with the increasingly interesting Portable Media Center players from Creative , iRiver , Toshiba , and others . Prices for such devices range from $200 to $800 , with 20GB to 30GB mainstream players available for around $300 . To watch TV shows as you go about town , you have several options . If you already subscribe to TiVo , download the company 's new $25 Desktop Plus software , a one-time purchase that lets you move video from your TiVo onto an iPod , a PSP , a Treo , or certain Nokia devices . If you already own a Windows XP Media Center Edition PC , you can use WMP 10 or 11 to easily transfer your stored video from the PC to compatible devices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( www.slingmedia. com ; review at find.pcworld.com/54548 ) . Although not all the glitches have been worked out , it lets you use a newer Windows Mobile device , such as the Motorola Q , on a 3G ( third-generation ) phone network to remotely watch and control your TV and DVR via the $200 Slingbox TVstreaming device . For free , Orb Networks ( www.orb.com ) offers similar features for devices with Windows Media Player ( review at find.pcworld.com/54546 ) . CALL FOR VIDEO WHILE HANDHELDS LET you easily watch video anywhere , in most cases you must load the player before you leave home , or use a separate service . New cell phones and networks let you receive video anywhere-well , anywhere there 's a fast 3G network such as EvDO or UMTS . Check with your provider to find out if you have service in your area ; if so , for $15 to $25 per month added to your cell phone bill , Cingular , Sprint , and Verizon will give you unlimited access to a rather small selection of games , music , and video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of content overlap . All offer short clips from the usual suspects such as CNN , The Discovery Channel , ESPN , Fox , The Weather Channel , and others . Typically you can view a few music videos , recent sports and news highlights , or movie trailers . Most channels are n't live but are updated regularly . Currently Sprint offers the most options and has a feature the others do n't : live video feeds . Your device can get live news feeds from ABC , C-SPAN , Fox , and other sources . You can also see over a dozen channels that show the same video feed going to television sets . But just because you can see video on your cell , does n't mean you 'd want to . Navigating the menus , plus waiting for the media players to load and the content to buffer , can take 10 to 30 seconds . The clips are often highly compressed files at 176-by-144-pixel resolution and 15 frames per second , playing on just part of the phone 's screen . Even good images are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long . Not that you can-most phone content is less than 3 minutes long ; anything longer may rebuffer every minute or so . My rule for mobile video is simple : The smaller the screen , the more basic and personal the content . Lawrence of Arabia ? No . Sports highlights ? Perhaps . Talking heads and short , focused clips ? Okay . Hilarious video podcasts from Strong Bad Emails ? Now you 're talking ! YOUR VIDEO ON THE WEB YOU JUST CAME back from a vacation in Cancun , and you want to wow your family with videos of your Jet Ski prowess . Or maybe you got your friend 's " sick day " hole-in-one on your cell phone , and you want to share it with your buddies but not your boss . Or perhaps you caught dramatic rescues of flood victims and want to share the clip with the world . YouTube and the dozens of easy-to-use , free video-sharing sites like it can help you do all those things . Many of the sites offer the same core features ; where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video to and from mobile devices , and their ability to restrict viewing to people you select ( see chart on page 114 ) . SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE VIDEO-SHARING SITES ARE currently more similar than they are distinctive , and the services will probably become even more alike as they draw inspiration from one another . Typically they let you upload MPEG , QuickTime , and Windows Media formats , which the sites will then convert to Flash Video ( . flv ) files for hosting and playback . Flash offers good image quality and fast playback , and over 95 percent of systems already run it . Practically every site gives HTML links to embed your video in your blog or other Web page , or you can e-mail the link to friends and family . All the sites present some hassles , as well . Over most DSL and cable lines , expect to spend 3 to 20 minutes uploading a 3-minute clip . Most services have a license to use your clips any way they want , and you must indemnify them from any liability for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key one being traffic . According to online market researcher Hitwise , in late spring YouTube was by far the most frequented sharing site with 43 percent of all visits to video sites . Popularity has its downside : Although recent , wellknown , and highly rated videos are called out to visitors , the 35,000 new clips added each day make it easy for your opus to get lost in the YouTube video jungle . If you want a breadth of video options for delivery to different devices , other services merit consideration . Google Video automatically generates downloadable iPod and PSP versions of free content . Several services , like Eyespot , offer delivery to mobile phones . If you 're creating longer pieces , you may need a site that does n't limit file size or length , like Google Video or Ourmedia.com . Several sites , like Eyespot , Jumpcut , and YouTube , also let you send clips via MMS ( Multimedia Messaging Service ) over high-speed cellular networks such as EvDO and UMTS directly to your account 's page . Sprint and Verizon offer similar-though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And services such as Abazab.com and Umundo.com let you send phone video via MMS directly to your pages on MySpace and My Yahoo , for example . All are free ( for now ) , with Jumpcut 's simple editing making it the most attractive . Once your video is posted , controlling who sees it is difficult-just ask Hollywood . Or Paris Hilton . If you need some privacy , send clips to a site that supports private groups where you specify who can see your video . Know , however , that privacy features can be defeated , so if you 're worried about any dire consequences if your video gets out , do n't post it at all . No site stands far above the rest , but Eyespot 's balance of innovative cellphone features , private groups , downloadable clips , and online editing and mixing raises it just a bit above its peers . However , with many of these services being up-front about their beta status , and others in denial , the situation may change tomorrow as new features debut and sites try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bandwidth they 're giving away . Sites like VideoEgg get revenue from licensing their uploading technology to AOL , while Rewer and others insert ads into submitted videos ( some share revenue with submitters ) . Video sharing has become so popular , Microsoft is getting into the game . Its YouTube-like project , code-named Warhoi , is scheduled to go live by year 's end , though no details are currently available . Regardless of coming changes , one thing will remain constant : On the Net , only a thin line separates professional and amateur content-which means you could be the next Web-video idol . Sidebar USAGE RULES Digital Video Rights and Wrongs WHAT CAN YOU do with the video you buy and download off the Web ? The answer depends on where you got the content . Most sites that have copyrighted content such as commercial movies prohibit reselling or redistributing the video file and use digital rights management schemes to back that up . Beyond that , restrictions vary by the site . For example , you can use the videos you buy from iTunes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Google Video 's copy-protected content-which includes most of its good commercial videos-plays only in its viewer app or on a PC with a live Net connection . Neither site lets you burn video to DVD for living-room playback . With one exception , CinemaNow and Movielink also prohibit you from burning films to DVDs that play on living-room players . The exception is a group of adult titles on CinemaNow that you can burn to DVDs . Movie studios are observing the success of this limited offering to determine whether to allow such disc burning for mainstream films . ( Movielink recently said it plans to offer this capability-via Sonic Solutions ' software-once studios give the go-ahead . ) Sidebar THE FLASH-BASED GOOGLE Video Player provides pop-up thumbnails to ease navigation in downloaded videos . Sidebar COMING ATTRACTIONS Broadcast TV on Phones ? CURRENT CELL-PHONE VIDEO offerings are underwhelming , but two ( incompatible ) technologies coming soon will let more carriers provide multiple live TV channels . DVB-H ( Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld ) , promoted by Motorola , Nokia , and Intel , and FLO ( Forward Link Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both beam live video to your phone ; each requires an overlay network on top of a 3G network . Current 3G nets have unicast capabilities , which work well for calls with a signal traveling between a single transmitter and receiver . But unicast networks bog down if many users demand the same content ; extra bandwidth is needed for each additional viewer of , say , a live World Series clip . DVB-H and FLO will let 3G networks multicast : One transmitter will reach many receivers . In the U.S. , Hiwire and Modeo are building DVB-H networks ; no cell carriers have announced plans to use them yet . Verizon has signed up for FLO . The network roll-outs should begin in late 2006 and throughout 2007 . Also on the way : TDtv , from the Sprint-funded IPWireless , which runs over existing 3G nets . You may also hear talk of firms ' using WiMax , also known as 802.16 ( a wireless broadband standard with longer range than 802.11 Wi-Fi ) , on handheld devices , but no plans have been announced .

Microsoft 's free Windows Movie Maker 2.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output is limited , however , to Windows Media and DV-AVI . To save in other formats , you 'll need a tool like Apple 's $30 QuickTime 7 Pro for Windows ( www.apple.com/quicktime ) . It 's easy to use and will export in many formats , including MPEG-4 . If you do n't want to use two apps to prep your video , you could let your chosen sharing site do the conversion and compression for you , or use more complete tools . In $100 apps such as Pinnacle Systems Studio Plus 10.5 Titanium Edition and Ulead VideoStudio 10 Plus , you get more features and output flexibility . They handle all common video formats ( plus high-def video from HDV camcorders ) , allow more flexible editing , create nice graphics , and can output to MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 for DVD , Web , iPod , and PSP playback .
