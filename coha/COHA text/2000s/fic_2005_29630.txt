Chapter One Digging through her briefcase , Colette Campbell snagged her cellular phone in one hand and her contact 's information sheet in the other , while her sister rummaged through her green glitter-embellished duffel bag to grab a bright pink , misshaped vibrator . Both girls were notorious for bringing their work home ; tonight was no exception . " Amy , what the heck is that for ? " Colette eyed the odd curve at the end of the oversized contraption . In her opinion , Amy 's current employer had taken its passion line to the extreme , with the most popular products designed by her imaginative sister . But they were shooting for the next must-have sex toy . And Colette had to admit several of Amy 's creations were already must-haves for her own bedroom . Too bad they were the ones meant for singles . " This baby will put Adventurous Accessories over the top , " Amy said , grinning with unabashed pride . She made the same claim with each of her toys , though Colette chose not to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mind for business . Coupled with an affinity for the intricacies of sex , which she 'd obviously acquired from their mother , Amy had a hot combination for today 's boudoir market . Consequently , she fully intended for one of her personally designed products to become thenext Jack Rabbit . Like practically every other female in America , Colette had watched Kim Cattrall 's Samantha lose her senses over the unique vibrator on Sex and the City . And , like practically every other female in America , she 'd wasted no time purchasing a set of talented rabbit ears of her own . Thank God . Lord knows that battery-operated bunny helped her numerous times when Jeff had n't got the job done . At least she had one " energize-her " in the apartment during her six months dating Mr. Perfect . " So what does it do ? " Colette asked , accustomed to Amy 's tendency of bringing her sex trinkets home to show off her latest idea . While Amy played Vanna , running a finger down the smooth length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Alibi 's customers were extremely specific regarding when she should make calls . In this case , the woman wanted a message left while the contact was gone . A typical request . For some reason , the lie seemed more believable when heard on an answering machine . Colette 's eyes ventured to the referral line on the bottom of the front page . " Amy ? " " Yeah ? " Amy said , still grinning at the toy . " What 's up with this ? " She pointed to the name scribbled across the page . " Referred by Amy Campbell ? " Colette read the annotation made by the My Alibi sales associate . Client specifically requested Colette Campbell as her sales representative . " Oh , I ca n't believe I forgot to tell you , " Amy said , scooting closer to Colette on the couch . She pointed to the data sheet . " That 's a friend of mine . She needed a way to spend a week with her boyfriend , and I told her about My Alibi . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Colette did n't like lying for a living , and she did n't plan to do it much longer , only until she had enough money to start her boutique . " I thought you agreed that what these people do is n't right . " " I know it is n't , but Erika is n't lying to a husband . " Colette 's attention moved back to the information sheet , specifically the " Relationship to Client " line . " Her uncle ? " " She 's found the love of her life , but she does n't think her uncle will approve , " Amy explained , shrugging as though this were no big deal . " She needs an alibi for a week to spend some alone time with Butch and see if he really is the one . " " Why does she have to lie to her uncle to spend a week with her boyfriend ? " Colette did n't like the sound of this . What was Amy getting her into ? " He 's her guardian , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Colette 's raised brows , she continued , " Listen . I knew you would n't help on your own , so I had her go through My Alibi . That way it 's merely another client , right ? And besides , she 's my friend and needs help . You wo n't let me down here , will you ? " Letting Amy down was something Colette was determined not to do . And Amy knew it . Occasionally , like right now , she used it to her advantage . However , there was no way Colette would help if Erika was n't an adult . " You ca n't hire My Alibi unless you 're eighteen . And if she is n't eighteen , I ca n't help her . " " She is eighteen . Her birthday was last month . " Sure enough , the client 's date of birth on the application matched Amy 's statement . " Come on , she 's an adult looking for an alibi , and she is n't lying to a husband . She simply wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , right ? Give her a chance at true love ? " Amy asked . " For me ? " Colette sighed . " All right , " she conceded . " I 'll help her . " Amy leaned forward and hugged her sister , while her long ponytail smothered Colette 's face and made her smile . " You 're rotten , you know that , do n't you ? " Colette asked . " Yep , " Amy agreed , moving back to her bag and holding up the new toy . Her mission had been accomplished , so naturally , she turned her focus back to her newest product . " Tell your friend I 'll help her this one time , but I do n't plan to do it again . She really should n't be lying to her uncle . " " Got it , " Amy said , punching a finger in the air for emphasis , but her eyes never ventured from the vibrator . " Is n't it amazing ? " She switched her voice to produce infomercial appeal , flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive curve allows the smooth , pulsing tip to hit the G-spot precisely . Every time . And if that does n't pique your interest , feast your eyes on this . " Sounding like a late-night home-shopping host , she pushed a small button on the handle with her index finger . " Ahhh , see ? The end lights up like a rainbow . " Holding the glowing contraption against her forearm , Amy let the pulsating head play against her skin while she giggled . " Cool , huh ? " Okay . Colette failed to see why illuminating like a multicolored strobe light would be of importance , particularly if you considered where those colors would be located if and when they hit the proverbial bull's-eye . But she humored Amy , nonetheless . " Yeah , sis . Real cool . If you have a spot to find . " Amy punched the switch and dropped Pinky to the couch , where it rolled like a deformed banana until lodging between the back of the sofa and the cushion . " No way . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geez , you do n't know what you 're missing . " Colette merely smirked . From what she could tell , Jeff did good to find his own part , much less hers . But rather than elaborate on how extremely dull those six months had been , she dialed the number listed on the My Alibi fact sheet . " Seriously ? Did he , you know , even look for it ? " Amy asked , obviously bewildered at this revelation . Did he look for it ? Hmmm . Let 's think about it . Well , that 'd be a definite no . Matter of fact , all he looked for , as far as Colette could tell , was his own satisfaction . Which he obtained . Every time . And pretty dang quick , at that . Funny thing was , Jeff looked and acted every part the ladies ' man . Strutted around with his much-too-muscled chest puffed out , his politician 's smile plastered on tight and every wavy hair in place . Oh , and not a single tan line on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home-tanning bed , coupled with his ritual to make certain he stayed on each side the same number of minutes . Colette had mistakenly believed the attention he paid to his looks stemmed from his business , rather than his mega-ego . He 'd used his primary asset , his body , to promote a growing chain of health-food stores ; therefore , he had to look healthy , right ? Of course , the result was quite phenomenal . Folks saw him as their goal and bought his stuff aplenty . The fact he 'd tacked on a couple of Atlanta 's Best Body titles did n't hurt either . Yep , he was pretty to look at , all right . But a dud in the sack . Heck , Colette would 've bet plenty of money on his ability to please . She 'd have lost that bet . Shoot , she 'd have put money on him staying true too . Ditto for losing the wager . " In case you 've forgotten , Jeff and I have been over for two months . Matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith 's finger last weekend . Just as well , since he was banging her the whole time we were together . Hey , who knows ? Maybe he found her G-spot . He sure never found mine . " That sounded bitter . And she was not bitter . Relieved was more like it . She 'd tried to make the whole commitment thing work , in spite of Jeff leaving much to be desired in the bedroom . In her bedroom , anyway . As she learned two months ago , he 'd made his way through plenty of other beds during their time together . " Maybe you should try this out . It 'll find the spot . " Amy picked up the translucent pink vibrator and held it to her cheek . " It 's waterproof too . And you do n't even need a man . Really , you should give it a trial run . " Do n't need a man . Yep , that 'll fit the bill . " Maybe I should . " Colette laughed . Heck , maybe a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get her out of this funk . **25;171;TOOLONG on-thirty , she was still searching for a guy who could carry on an intelligent conversation , had at least some semblance of a career plan and- wonder of wonders- could make her toes curl as much as one of Amy 's toys . She was beginning to think she might have to let go of one of the three qualities . But if anything had to fly out the window , it would not be curling toes . Amy lowered the vibrator and focused on the phone perched against her sister 's ear . " Hey , Colette , you dialed the number , did n't you ? " Colette 's laughter lodged in her throat . She had n't heard the answering machine pick up . But there 'd definitely been a ring on the other end . Had n't there ? Yeah , she 'd heard a ring . When had it stopped ? More importantly , how much of their sisterly conversation had been recorded ? Dang . A path of heat blazed from her throat to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the office tomorrow for this faux pas . How do you explain leaving a message about sex toys on a customer 's voice mail ? But she could n't hang up . She 'd used the cellular provided by My Alibi , and the fictitious name Amy 's friend had chosen for her company would be displayed on the caller ID . She gathered her wits . So this would n't be her best performance as a My Alibi representative ; it 'd be okay . She 'd simply apologize and begin her regular spiel . Taking a deep breath , she prepared to start the process of prevarication via the uncle 's answering machine . Then she heard a responding exhalation on the other end . No . Way . There was not a living , breathing person listening to her now . Hearing her discuss G-spots , no less , when she supposedly represented a computer-graphics training company . Certainly Erika 's uncle had n't answered the phone , heard her talking and eavesdropped on that steamy little conversation with Amy . Had he ? Only one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , she mustered up her courage . " Hello ? " " Well , hello . " ( Continues ... )
