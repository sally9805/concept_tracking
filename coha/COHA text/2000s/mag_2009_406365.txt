When my five-year-old complained that it hurt to pee , I immediately suspected a uirinary tract infection and called the doctor . It turned out the reason she hurt " down there " was because she was n't wiping properly and the unhygienic results were causing her a great deal of discomfort . I was mortified and ran out to buy bum wipes to help her clean up her act . Most bottom troubles are n't commonly discussed in parenting circles . There 's something about " privates " that is , well , private . You do n't want other parents to think you are n't taking care of your tot 's little tush - and surrounding territory - properly . Lose the guilt , says Michelle Ponti , a paediatrician in London , Ont . " While improper hygiene can sometimes be a factor , it usually has nothing to do with a parent 's care of the child . " We asked Ponti and other health care experts for the bottom line on bottom troubles . ANAL FISSURES If your child cries every time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her stools , there 's a good chance she has a small tear known as an anal fissure - especially if her stools are hard . When children become constipated , they may strain to push the stool out and tear the skin around the anus . The tear , or fissure , can easily be seen when you examine your child 's behind . What to do Fissures heal very well as soon as you treat the constipation , says Henry Ukpeh , an associate clinical professor of paediatrics at BC Children 's Hospital . Ask the doctor to recommend a stool softener , and add more fluids ( especially water ) and fibre to your child 's diet . Applying petroleum jelly to the sore spot will help alleviate the pain . BALANITIS Inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis is very common in young boys who are uncircumcised . Your son may complain of itchiness and discomfort , and you 'll notice mild swelling , redness and some discharge , particularly under the foreskin . Balanitis is usually caused when the area between the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of the Paediatric In-patient Unit at Toronto 's Hospital for Sick Children . What to do Proper hygiene and a topical antibiotic or antifungal usually take care of this plumbing problem . " Sometimes we have to counsel parents on how to clean that area properly , " says Weinstein . " They have the misconception that you should be able to retract the foreskin and clean under it , but the foreskin in young boys does n't retract . All that 's required is gentle cleaning around the outside of the foreskin with soap and water . " By the time your son is five or six , teach him to retract his own foreskin and clean beneath it once a week when he is having a bath . LABIAL ADHESIONS If the skin of your daughter 's genitals appears to be stuck together , do n't panic . Even though the condition looks worrisome , it 's quite common in young girls between the ages of three months and six years , and rarely causes problems . Urine , stool , diaper rash and other irritants can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin surrounding the entrance to the vagina ) . The lips may fuse together as they heal and partially cover the opening of the vagina . " Labial adhesions are only a concern if the labia are so fused together that your daughter has trouble peeing , " says Ukpeh . What to do Never try to separate the labia forcefully . If the adhesions are blocking the flow of urine , your doctor may prescribe a topical estrogen cream . To prevent new adhesions , use a lubricant , such as Vaseline , on a daily basis . Try to avoid irritants ( bubble baths , fabric softeners , perfumed soaps ) , and give your child some bare bum time every day . PINWORMS While these tiny , white , thread-like worms are mostly a nuisance , they still make parents shudder - and children itch . Pinworms spread easily when an infected child scratches the itchy area ( usually the anus , but girls may have an itchy vulva too ) and gets pinworm eggs on her fingers or under her fingernails . They can also be picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys . What to do If your child complains at night of an itchy bum , pull out your flashlight and see if you can spot any coming out of her bottom after she 's gone to sleep . You can also press a piece of transparent adhesive tape on the skin around her anus in the morning before she gets up and have the doctor check it for pinworms and their eggs . Pinworm infections are treated with an oral antiparasitic medicine . Sometimes the entire family needs to be treated . To prevent reinfection , make sure everyone washes their hands thoroughly after going to the bathroom , keep fingernails short and wash clothes and bedding regularly . URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS UTIs are twice as common in girls as boys simply because of female anatomy . Pain while peeing is a big red flag for this bottom trouble . Other telltale UTI signs include more frequent urination but just a dribble of pee , foul-smelling or cloudy urine , and sometimes fever . It 's difficult to diagnose a bladder infection in toddlers because they may not complain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever and irritability are the only symptoms . What to do To prevent any damage to the kidneys , your child should see a doctor within 24 hours if she shows signs of a UTI . They clear up quickly with oral antibiotics . In the meantime , give her plenty of fluids to drink ( water and cranberry juice are good choices ) . To prevent further infections , encourage her to go when she has to go and not hold it . VULVOVAGINITIS Redness , discomfort and itching of the outer part of the vagina ( the vulva ) is common in young girls . The lining of the vulva tends to be thin and prone to infection from feces and other irritants . " Improper hygiene can be a major factor , " says Ponti . " Four- and five-year-old girls are independent in the bathroom for the most part , and they 'll either not wipe properly or not wipe at all because they 're in such a hurry to get back to their playing . " What to do Teach your daughter to wipe from front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of stool do n't end up in the vaginal area , advises Ponti . " You might also want to become more involved with her hygiene after she poops for the first little while . " Moist wipes , such as Candoo Flushable Toilet Wipes , will help her do a better cleanup job . Avoid chemical irritants in bubble baths and heavily scented soaps , and do n't let her sit in a wet bathing suit for too long . YEAST INFECTIONS If your baby has a diaper rash that persists despite your best efforts to treat it , yeast may be to blame . Both girls and boys can get a yeast diaper rash caused by Candida albicans , says Weinstein . The angry red rash has slightly raised borders and satellite lesions ( red spots a slight distance from the main rash ) and the skin may be scaly . A diaper rash that is left untreated can easily become infected with yeast , and children on antibiotics or who have recently had thrush ( a yeast infection of the mouth ) are also more susceptible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeast infection ; you need to apply an anti-yeast or antifungal cream , such as nystatin , clotrimazole or miconazole . Try to limit moisture by changing your baby 's diaper frequently and using highly absorbent disposable diapers . And try to let your little one 's bottom air-dry whenever possible .
