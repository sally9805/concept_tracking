Chapter One May 1670 Facing white cliffs in a strait of ocean separating two kingdoms , a fleet of ships lay at anchor . It was the fleet of the kingdom of England , sent to escort precious cargo : a princess of England and France , the most famous princess in Christendom , in fact . A yacht with a rakish bow slashed through the water toward the best and greatest of these anchored ships ; the king on board liked fast yachts , fast horses , fast women . The princess was his sister , and he and those with him could not wait to see her . " Monmouth 's on the yacht ! " said a young woman leaning over the side of the princess 's ship . She had stepped atop a huge coil of rope for this view , and a sailor , eyeing her satins and the single strand of fat pearls at her neck , had warned her to be careful , but she 'd sent him off with a withering comment to mind his own business . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools-telling her what to do . The sight of King Charles 's yacht racing toward them was thrilling . She could see the crowd waiting on shore . The queen and her father and her best friend were among them . She was so glad to see England again , she was n't certain she 'd be able to keep herself from kneeling on the beach and kissing the sand of it when shelanded . " And who else is there ? " asked the friend with her , like her a maid of honor to the princess , and like her , excited to be witnesses to this , King Charles and his sister meeting again after so many years-ten if it was a day . Flags were flying from all the topmasts , whipping smartly in the breeze . The day was bright and clear . Everyone was dressed in their finest , felt high-spirited , mettlesome as horses , stirred and thrilled by this reunion . " Climb up here and see for yourself ! " Alice said . " Do n't tease , Alice , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice 's gown , for by now Alice was leaning over the edge at a dangerous angle , the feet in her dainty satin shoes on tiptoe . " The Duke of York is with His Majesty and Prince Rupert-oh , they 're close enough to hear me-Rupert ! Prince Rupert ! Monmouth ! " Shrieking the names , Alice waved a gauzy scarf back and forth with wild abandon and was rewarded with a hearty wave from the king 's cousin , a smile from the king 's son , and a startled glance and then a grin from King Charles himself . Loud cheers had come up from hundreds of throats , the throats of the sailors manning the ships , the throats of the crowd on shore . They , too , were waving and clapping , cheering the king . Gulls , who 'd idly settled among the rigging , rose like winged blessings into the sky . " He has n't changed a whit , " Alice said . " Who ? " " The king . I wonder who he 'll be flirting with by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once ! Mademoiselle de Keroualle ! You will join the other maids immediately ! The king is boarding- " It was the keeper of the maids , Madame Dragon , Alice called her . Alice and Renee ran across the deck to join the elite circle of young women around the princess , all in satin gowns , in dainty shoes with stiff gauze bows , their hair coaxed by servants into curling orderly disorder , fat strands of pearls around their slender necks , drops at their delectable ears . As young women , unmarried , their very youth was beautiful . As part of the household of the foremost princess in France , they were everything that was fashionable . There was n't a woman on shore who would n't be biting her lip with vexation and determining to buy new gowns once theirs were seen . They could n't wait . Princesse Henriette-her formal title at the French court was Madame-glanced toward Alice and Renee as they slipped in among the other women , a slight arch in her brow , both questioning and condemning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice , one of a group of restless and handsome noblemen , but then the orchestra that had been sent to accompany the princess struck up a lively tune , and all about them another cheer began from sailors in the rigging , from those standing in order on the deck as the sardonic face of the king of England , Charles , the second of that name , appeared just above the brass of the ship 's railing . In another moment he had leaped to the deck . " Minette . " He held out his arms , his face made handsome by joy , and his sister ran to him , and he hugged her close and then swung her around , her skirt swelling out like a bell . Men had followed him over the side , appearing one after the other , dressed almost as sumptuously as any woman , laces , blue ribbons , diamond pins , long , curling hair , false , a wig but magnificent nonetheless . The princess was immediately surrounded by them . Her other brother , the Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Rupert elbowed York out of the way unceremoniously and said , " Little beauty . I thought we 'd never pry you from the Frenchies ' grasp . " Unfortunately , he spoke in French and loudly , so everyone near heard him . The Duke of Monmouth , King Charles 's son , insisted on his hug , and the princess danced from one male relative to another , kissing their faces and wiping at tears running down her face . " She 's ruining her rouge . " It was the same young man who spoke before , with the same sneering , spiteful tone . " We 're in England now , d'Effiat . You 'd best watch your tongue , " Alice told him . " Oh , I am afraid , " he mocked her , and the others with him laughed maliciously , even Beuvron , who was her friend . Alice turned her back on the group of them . The day was too happy to spoil with quarreling . There had been enough of that in France . This was adventure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about to see her best friend in the world , and the queen she so loved , and her father , and there was nothing d'Effiat or Beuvron or any of them could say to ruin a single moment . Her eyes met Prince Rupert 's , and he winked , then made her a bow . Renee pointed to the king 's son Monmouth . " He 's handsome . " She was n't the only woman who 'd noticed Monmouth . " Yes , and he knows it , so beware . " Protocol , dear to French hearts , was being ignored . Everything was becoming very confused . The maids of honor had broken rank in spite of the Dragon 's frowns , lured by Monmouth 's smiles , by Rupert 's twinkling boisterousness , by King Charles 's laughter , by the sense of froth and frivolity that seemed to have climbed right on board with him . Those who accompanied the princess from France , a duc here , a vicomte there , a priest or two , the captain of her household guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past the princess 's tall brother and cousin , to introduce themselves over the noise of the orchestra and the bellows of that cousin , who seemed to be ordering something from above in the rigging . He was . A great willow basket was being lowered from a pulley . Squeals from the maids of honor added to the growing melee as they rushed here and there to be out of its way . Once the basket was on deck , Prince Rupert patted it fondly , fell on one knee before his princess cousin , and made a motion for her to climb in , using his knee as step . " I 'm not to go overboard in this ? " Princesse Henriette cried , delighted and horrified . She spoke in French because she 'd lived in France all her life , and her English was small . " I have n't introduced- " King Charles swept her up in his arms . " Introductions are n't necessary . We 'll do what 's proper on shore . But for now , I claim my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English waters , and she 's mine . " With that , he placed her into the basket , giving one and all a glimpse of her stockings-vivid green-the princess laughing so hard , she could n't speak . " This is highly irregular- " began the French ambassador . " Pay me a formal call to complain , " said King Charles . His eyes , a rogue 's eyes , swept over the maids of honor . " One beautiful woman is n't enough . My sister must have escort . " Young women everywhere held their breath , dropped into giggling , graceful curtsies as his eyes touched , considered , and admired each of them . The captain of the household guard cleared his throat . The Dragon hovered , fluttering , not certain what to do . No one knew at this point . King Charles 's eyes found Louise Renee de Keroualle , the most beautiful among them . " Why am I not surprised ? " Rupert said to his cousin York . In a heartbeat , Renee stepped up on Rupert 's knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stockings showed , and they were the same green as the princess 's . It was shocking and exciting . King Charles 's eyes found Alice . She had dropped as gracefully as a flower drooping . A gliding , natural grace of movement was one of her beauties . He walked over and stood before her , looking down at her bent head , the riot of curls there . " My dear Verney . " " Sir . " " Her Majesty has missed you dreadfully . " " And I her . " Her heart was beating very fast . He was her liege , her lord , her king . She 'd known him since she was a child and he a penniless , beggar sovereign without a kingdom . This was a great and powerful moment . " Did you behave yourself in France ? " " No , sir . And I am happy to say I have acquired the most beautiful gowns in the world . " " The better to finally find a husband with ? " A child of court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she met his eyes . " That was my plan , sir . " " Lord Colefax was a fool . I do believe we 've missed you . " He held out his hand to help her rise , a signal honor . Enormously proud , Alice walked to the basket , cutting her eyes in a deliberate , provocative challenge to the group of sneering , fashionable young Frenchmen , impressed in spite of themselves . She stepped up onto Rupert 's knee . " Are your stockings green , also ? " asked Prince Rupert . It was all she could do not to kiss him on the cheek and add to the complete breakdown of decorum . She could see how shocked the French around her were . She bunched her skirts to climb into the basket , and the answer was evident . Sailors began to cheer , but whether it was for the glimpse of stocking or the jerking rise of the basket was unclear . There was an immediate bustle as the king , his brother , his cousin , and his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope ladder to the yacht , as nimble , as quick as any man in the rigging . People from the French court ran to the ship 's side . Everything was happening so fast ! No one had been properly introduced ! Nothing was going as planned ! Other boats , yachts , wherries , rowboats , bobbed like corks some distance away-clearly those boats would bring them to shore , but they 'd thought to have a reception on board , a long dinner . Speeches were planned ! Suspended over the water , Alice felt her heart rise like a lark . The sun was high and bright , the wind strong . The crowd on shore waved hats and large handkerchiefs , calling , hurrahing . The sea near the shore sent in wave after wave of little white frills , as if hundreds of serving maids had dropped caps in the water to celebrate this day . At the top of the sheer cliffs , the huge fortress of Dover Castle awaited them . She could see people standing on the parapets . Flags flapped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Princesse Henriette and Renee screamed . Alice took her scarf , held it over the side , where the wind clutched at it . The scarf was long , gauzy , made of spiderweb and forbidden Dutch lace by nimble nuns ' fingers . Good-bye to quarreling , good-bye to meanness , and here 's to my good fortune in England , she thought , and she let it go and screamed herself as the basket lurched straight downward , to the sound of a high , shrill trill of laughter from the princess . On board the yacht , the king 's Life Guards settled the basket , and one of them stepped forward to help the women out . Alice had the sensation of falling as she met his eyes . " I know you , " she said in English . " You 're Robin Saylor , are n't you ? " " Richard , Lieutenant Richard Saylor , at your service . " He signaled for the basket to rise , led Princesse Henriette to a bench covered with cushions as the rest of royal family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard quickly pulled up the anchor , the Duke of York took the tiller , Monmouth unfurled the sails , and the yacht was moving away from the ship . " Mission performed admirably , " said King Charles . " I did n't have to listen to a single speech . Rupert , you owe me twenty guineas . " He smiled upon his sister . " As you can see , we are not as formal as King Louis . " Princesse Henriette leaned back against cushions , raised her face to the sun . " I do n't know when I 've laughed so much . " She still spoke in French , but half the English court knew the language . So many had lived abroad during England 's civil war . " Are all your ladies wearing green stockings ? " " Only the pretty ones . " Roses and lilies , mint and balm , lay on the floor of the deck like a carpet . She picked up a rose . " Is all this for me ? " " Everything is for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into the shape you last saw him wearing , but in truth , he resembles nothing so much as a pregnant sheep these days , does n't he , Lieutenant Saylor ? Tell her . " The Life Guard King Charles addressed smiled but was silent . " Lieutenant Saylor has the gift of diplomacy . " The yacht had come in very fast to the shore , but it was large enough that it had to stop yards out . There was a harbor built , but it was dangerously silted with sand and shingle from the cliffs . " I see my father . I 'm certain of it , " Alice said to Renee . She pointed to the group standing under a canopy with the queen . Alice felt as if her heart were going to fly out of her chest . " And there 's Barbara . " She stood to wave her arms . " Barbara ! " Efficiently , expertly , the Life Guards dropped the sails and the anchor , and the yacht stopped as obediently as a docile mare . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king 's Life Guards standing on the shore walked into the water , then swam to the yacht . A rowboat was clumsily maneuvered close to its side . " Your carriage awaits , " said King Charles to his sister . " The harbor is silted up . This is the only way I can land you without wetting you . " ( Continues ... )
