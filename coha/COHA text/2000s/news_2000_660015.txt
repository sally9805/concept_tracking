<p> Texans are famous for their independence , but when Texas Baptists took a stand at their state convention two weeks ago , it was for much more , they claim , than just doing things their way : It was to save the soul of the Baptist tradition . In a stunning step that sent a shock through the conservative-led national Southern Baptist Convention , Texas Baptists voted to withhold more than $ 5 million in funding from the SBC 's seminaries and executive committee . They then voted to open the doors of the Texas Baptist Convention to churches from outside the state . No one underestimates the potential impact of these actions on the future of America 's largest Protestant denomination , now close to 16 million . " They are lining up the boxes for a parallel and competitive national convention , " is the view of Bill Merrell , the SBC 's vice president for convention relations . " This is the most significant schism that Southern Baptists have confronted since they split from Northern Baptists in 1845 to form the Convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moderate Wake Forest Divinity School in North Carolina . " It 's going to have long-term effects on the entire system . " Fragmentation has occurred among Southern Baptists ever since conservatives took over the denomination 20 years ago . Some moderate churches broke off in 1987 to form the Alliance for Baptists , and , others in 1991 , to form the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship ( CBF ) , which now claims some 1,800 congregations . Over the past decade , a slew of alternative seminaries and agencies has developed , some with links to the CBF . But this is the big blow - almost 1 of every 5 Southern Baptists is a Texan - and it has arisen following revisions made at the SBC annual meeting in June to the church 's basic statement of faith . At the core , it is a conflict between those seeking to conform the tradition to strict " biblical faithfulness " and those for whom individual freedom to interpret Scripture stands as a fundamental Baptist principle . SBC conservatives have emphasized biblical " inerrancy , " but " Texans understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a responsibility and privilege to interpret Scripture out of their relationship with God , " says the Rev. Charles Wade , executive director of the Baptist General Convention of Texas ( BGCT ) . Flowing out of this divergence , for example , are the SBC 's recent stands calling on women to be submissive to their husbands and forbidding women pastors . Former President Jimmy Carter publicly ended his lifelong affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this month , saying that the latest steps violate the premises of his Christian faith . Who is the final authority ? " The conservative fundamentalists have taken steps incrementally , culminating in the 2000 Baptist Faith and Message document , to exert authority and control over the conscience of believers and to impose a creedal document upon the Baptist family , " says Mr. Wade . " We have had confessions of faith throughout Baptist history , but they have always carefully defined themselves as statements ' without mandatory authority . ' " That phrase was replaced in the new statement with the intent to make it " an instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SBC seminaries are expected to sign the new document . The Texans conducted a study of the seminaries and hiring and firing of faculty . They then voted by 3 to 1 to divert $ 4.3 million from the six SBC-funded seminaries and $ 1 million from the SBC Executive Committee and to give the funds to Baptist seminaries and institutions in Texas . " Our intent is for Texas Baptists to make sure we hold the Baptist vision secure , " Wade says . Some 15 years from now , he adds , pastors from SBC seminaries will have a very different view from traditional Baptist teachings . R. Albert Mohler Jr. , president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville , Ky. , takes issue with that claim . " The explosive issue is whether or not there is a set of basic convictions that should bind all Southern Baptists together and that we should expect of those who teach and serve in our seminaries and institutions , " he says . " The alternative to that is theological anarchy . " According to Dr. Mohler , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist seminaries , but it just has n't been enforced . And he believes most Baptists support it . Dr. Merrell also disputes the claim of creedalism , pointing out that state conventions and local churches are free to choose whether or not they approve the latest statement . Last week , Arkansas 's state convention rejected the statement . Others have supported it , and some conventions are divided . " In North Carolina , what 's holding it together is four giving plans that allow churches to give toward or away from the SBC , " Dr. Leonard says . " Otherwise there would be a division . " Texans are also unhappy , Wade says , with the removal of the sentence saying that Jesus Christ is the criterion by which the Bible is to be interpreted . " Jesus reinterpreted the Old Testament , " he says , " and early in Baptist life , it was made clear that the Old Testament was to be interpreted by the new , and all of it by Christ . " The conservatives dropped the sentence to keep Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul and Old Testament writers , as , for example , on the issue of women 's role in the church . " Women have been at the heart of this fight , " says Nancy Ammerman , professor of sociology of religion at Connecticut 's Hartford Seminary . " Over 1,000 Southern Baptist women have been ordained to the ministry , with some 50 to 100 who are actual senior or sole pastors . Now it will be much less possible for a church to call a woman pastor . " Trust is what binds churches Baptists have never had hierarchical structures - local churches are autonomous and call their own clergy - but they did develop a vertical system of relationships between local , state , and national bodies and a cooperative program of funding . It 's this structure that the Texans have threatened . " They have turned back seven decades of partnership and destroyed the vital system of trust that has bound Southern Baptists and our state conventions together , " says Mohler , a key SBC leader . " The SBC was predicated on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crown ... is a major disconnect , " Leonard concurs . What happens next is difficult to predict . Each side says the other has been misrepresenting it among the faithful , and there seems little appetite for attempting to bridge the divide . " They are insisting that the SBC change the Baptist Faith and Message statement , " Merrell says , " which is the height of arrogance . " " The conservative leaders have engaged in a 20-year campaign to put a very conservative stamp on the SBC , " says Professor Ammerman , author of " Baptist Battles . " " They are doing exactly what they set out to do . The fact they might lose support along the way is not likely to deter them . " Now the 6,000 churches in Texas will have to decide whether they are going to follow the direction set by the BGCT or send their own monies to the SBC . More crucial , perhaps , will be the extent to which churches outside of Texas begin to align themselves with the Texas convention . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist organization was the Wal-Mart of denominations - you could get everything there , " Ammerman says . " Now people can not only imagine going somewhere else , but they 've got the somewhere else to go . " Leonard sees this as a time of permanent transition . " It may take a long time for the implications to become clear , " he says , " but the system is coming unglued . " It could become a difficult period for local churches , as ministers have to decide where they stand , and congregations , which pick their own pastors , whom to choose and what group to align with . What is clear , he emphasizes , is that Southern Baptists really have to talk about identity . This has been an issue for the under-40 crowd , the divinity school professor says , and now it 's something everyone has to face . " The SBC , to its credit , has said , ' We 've revised our confession of faith ; this is who we are , live with it . ' Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go find something else . ' And I think that 's fine . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
