In the 1860 's , the Lakota and their allies , led by Chief Red Cloud , closed and immigrant route and made it stick <p> At fifty yards , I would rather be shot at with a revolver in the hands of an average marksman . An Indian seldom misses anything the size of a man at that distance , and he will send the arrow clear through the body . These fellows are the finest riders I ever saw ; they ride into battle without saddle or bridle , - only a lariat round the nose of the pony . How they keep on them I do n't see ; but they do keep on and put them through all sorts of maneuvers with the greatest facility , It is rather a pretty sight to see a lot of warriors coming to the attack with their gay trappings and feathers . They are ' light horsemen ' and attack in open order , never coming straight in a charge , but circle round and round in a gallop till they are near enough to fire . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , and will keep four of them in the air all the time at a distance of fifty or sixty yards . " <p>  --  Lieut . Col. L. P. Bradley , Commanding Officer , Fort C. F. Smith <p> December 25 , 1866 : the Christmas ball at Fort Laramie was especially merry . Tables of viands lined the hallways of Old Bedlam ( the bachelor officers ' quarters ) , musicians from the post band produced sprightly dance tunes , and junior officers ' wives flirted ( decorously ) with their husbands ' superiors . Col. I. N. Palmer , Fort Laramie 's commanding officer , was genial . A blinding blizzard had shut down travel , and the fort , which anchored the Army 's three outposts along the Bozeman Trail , was snug in contrast to the bitter weather out-of-doors . As everyone knew , even Red Cloud 's Lakota holed up in the wintertime . Then conversation died when-wrapped in a buffalo coat , wreathed in ice-Portugee Phillips burst in . The miner had ridden four days and 235 miles to deliver the worst possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Lakota and their allies had wiped out Capt . ( Brevet Lieut . Col. ) William Judd Fetterman and his entire detachment after they had marched bravely out four days earlier from Fort Phil Kearny to protect some woodcutters . <p> In his dispatch to Army headquarters , Fort Phil Kearny 's commander , Col. Henry Carrington , begged , " Do send me reinforcements forthwith .... I have had but today a fight unexampled in Indian warfare ; my loss is 94 killed . . . . I have recovered 49 bodies , and 35 more are to be brought in , in the morning , that have been found . Among the killed are Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Fetterman , Captain F. J. Brown and Lieutenant Grummond . . . . Depend upon it that the post will be held so long as a round or a man is left . Promptness is the vital thing . Give me officers and men . Only the new Spencer arms should be sent ; the Indians are desperate ; I spare none , and they spare none . " <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stayed behind brought in the bodies of their friends and dug graves in cold so intense men could only work 15 minutes at a time . Colonel Carrington had his men lay a fuse to the ammunition magazine . Should the Lakota overwhelm the fort , the women and children were to be herded inside . " ... in the event of a last desperate struggle , destroy all together , rather than have any captured alive . " <p> Whites called the Fetterman fight a massacre . The Lakota called it " The Battle of a Hundred Dead . " It was the biggest , but neither the only nor last fight along what came to be known as " the bloody Bozeman Trail . " <p> By the mid-19th century , neither Wyoming 's Powder River country nor Montana 's Yellowstone and Gallatin valleys-which the Bozeman Trail would traverse-were terra incognita . Trappers , scouts and prospectors knew the buffalo and Indian trails , and Army surveyors had already identified some good fords . Although these trails were adequate for small parties on foot or on horseback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades were avoided , and good graze and water for man and beast had to be available after each day 's travel of about 20 miles . <p> Before the Civil War , as many as 50,000 Oregon Trail immigrants passed through Fort Laramie in a single season . The treaty of 1851 apportioned ( or tried to apportion ) disputed tribal hunting grounds and , even more important-from the white perspective-guaranteed the safety of westering immigrants . <p> On May 26 , 1863 , Federal troops opened the siege of Vicksburg , and a thousand miles to the northwest at Alder Gulch in what would become Montana Territory , Bill Fairweather made the richest gold strike since California . For placer gold mining , miners did n't need expensive equipment or capital to find riches : just good luck and a gold pan , for which a shallow washbasin would suffice . <p> Gold rushers from the California diggings , merchants who catered to them , thieves and gamblers who preyed upon them-all raced north to these new diggings . Mountain man John Jacobs and his partner , natural-born promoter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better route connecting the Oregon Trail to Montana 's riches . Guides who knew such a shorter , easier route could ask five dollars from every wagon they led . <p> Bozeman and Jacobs ' road would depart the Oregon Trail at the mouth of Sage Creek ( near present-day Doug-las , Wyoming ) and traverse the dry alkaline plateaus in the rain shadow of the Wind River and Bighorn mountain ranges . Then it would slide west above the Bighorns , ford ( later ferry ) the Bighorn River and angle across the high prairie just south of today 's Pryor , Montana , into the lush Yellowstone and Gallatin valleys , where a few pioneering farmers were already settling . At the tiny settlement ( soon named Bozeman City ) , they 'd jig south to Virginia City . Five hundred miles : three months ' wagon travel . The Bozeman Trail was shorter , more direct , better watered and altogether a better wagon road than alternative routes , but there was one big drawback to the route . <p> On July 20 , 1863 , as Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek ( near present-day Buffalo , Wyoming ) , 150 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors confronted Bozeman 's first wagon train . An Indian leader warned , " You ca n't go on in the direction you are going . You are going into our country , where we hunt . This is the only good big hunting ground left for us . Your people have taken the rest or scared the game away . <p> " We wo n't let our women and children starve . This is where we make meat , and we will keep this land .... If you turn back to the Platte , we will let you go . We will not hurt you . " Most of Bozeman 's train followed this good advice and another route ; Bozeman and a small party pressed on to Virginia City . <p> More gold strikes erupted at Last Chance Gulch , Silver Bow and Confederate Gulch . The federal government was not disinterested : the war was costing millions every day , and Montana gold helped prop up the new " greenback " paper dollars . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants traveled the Bozeman Trail . In 1865 , after Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered , the Army turned its attention to the pesky little problem out West . The government closed the Bozeman Trail to civilians and sent Gen. Patrick E. Connor with a thousand men to settle the Indian troubles once and for all . Despite ferocious rhetoric , Connor 's expedition was a wreck . His men alternately froze and starved ; the single Arapaho village Connor did find and attack had been , prior to his attack , friendly . <p> Neither General Connor 's expedition nor Col. John M. Chivington 's 1864 assault on a peaceful Cheyenne village at Sand Creek , Colorado , went unnoticed by the usually fragmented , often contentious small bands of Lakota , Cheyenne and Arapaho who would soon combine under a single war chief : the legendary Red Cloud . Chivington 's and Connor 's murderous blunders also stirred pro-Indian sentiment in the East , where worries about Indian wars and their effect on the occupation of the South and the protection of the transcontinental railroad also influenced policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace commissioners invited the Indians , mainly Lakota , to Fort Laramie to sign a new treaty . While the Indians hoped to persuade the government to close the Bozeman Trail , the whites planned to keep the trail open by bribing the various tribes with annuities . <p> In a stunningly ill-timed move , during the treaty conference Col. Henry Carrington arrived with 700 men ( 500 of them new recruits ) and instructions to construct three new forts to protect immigrants along the Bozeman Trail . Red Cloud was livid : " The Great Father sends us presents and wants us to sell him the road , but White Chief goes with soldiers to steal the road before the Indians say Yes or No . " Seemingly oblivious to Red Cloud 's anger , Carrington marched north , and built Fort Phil Kearny on Little Piney Creek ( near present-day Sheridan , Wyoming ) and Fort C. F. Smith on the Bighorn River . <p> Through 1866 , despite numerous Indian attacks , some 2,000 individuals traveled the Bozeman Trail . Some were gold seekers , some freighters bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were immigrants seeking a new life in the West . A surprising number kept diaries . Bozeman Trail authority Susan Badger Doyle , whose collection of these diaries has recently been published , says they were intended as guidebooks for other family members who might follow after . <p> " Rolled 9 miles to Humfrevilles Camp , where we found the next water. - Plenty of Grass &; water for our stock , but hardly fit for our own use .... Soon after we watered the cattle and turned them out to graze a squad of Indians made a dash on one of the herds , but the herders were on the alert and gave them a volley , which soon routed them . One of the Indians was seen to fall from his pony , and was helped on again by the others . They killed one ox and maimed several others , with their arrows .... " Sam Blythe , July 23 , 1866 . " No hopes of leaving here Fort Phil Kearny for several days by order of headquarters ... I am meditating upon the adventure that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the danger , cold chills run through my blood . " The Rev. William K. Thomas , July 31 , 1866 . At the Yellowstone , a young woman inscribed her hopes on a tree : " Jennie Sanderson . Bound for Virginia City in the Happie Land of Caneon . " <p> Sam Blythe survived the Bozeman Trail , but the Reverend Thomas ' fears were realized when , on August 24 , 1866 , Thomas , his 8-year-old son and two other travelers were killed and scalped by Indians . We do n't know whether Jennie Sanderson reached the Happy Land of Canaan , but a later pilgrim carved an appreciation beneath her message : " Jennie you are a bully Gall . " <p> As cold weather approached , immigrant trains were combined in greater numbers for safety , and the parties that went out to cut wood for Fort Phil Kearny 's building needs and firewood were routinely attacked . By November , Fort Phil Kearny was under virtual siege . Cavalry horses were kept saddled at the gate for swift relief of attacked wood trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone outside the fort 's walls . Legendary mountain man and guide Jim Bridger , who had spent 40 years on the frontier , reported that 500 lodges had gathered on the Tongue River under Red Cloud . Red Cloud-who was to survive well into the 20th century-was an unusual warrior even among a warrior people . He 'd counted coup some 80 times ( Sitting Bull claimed only 45 ) . Contemporary reports-Indian and white-stress Red Cloud 's intelligence and charismatic leadership . Unlike Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse of the Hunkpapa Lakota , Red Cloud-of the Bad Face band-had spent his youth associating with soldiers and traders at Fort Laramie . Red Cloud understood white men . <p> Although Col. Henry Carrington was a punctilious garrison soldier , he 'd never seen combat . On November 3 , 1866 , a genuine military hero joined his command . Capt . William Judd Fetterman was a soldier 's son and grandson with a brilliant record under Gen. William T. Sherman during the Civil War . Fetterman may have believed he 'd been posted to Fort Phil Kearny as Carrington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to the Indians . He boasted , " A single company of regular could whip a thousand Indians , " and famously , " With eighty men I could ride through the Sioux nation . " Jim Bridger warned Fetterman that if he ever got into an Indian fight , it could well be his last fight . <p> White narratives about Indians have often revealed more about the white narrators than their Indian subjects . When the post-Civil War frontier and its opportunities for settlement seemed unlimited , whites called those who opposed settlement " murderous savages . " One hundred thirty years later , as Virginia City presents a picture of tailing dumps and tourists , and Bozeman , Montana , is troubled by sprawl , those Indians who whipped Captain Fetterman are often seen through a green haze of ecological wishful thinking . <p> The great buffalo hunting grounds that Red Cloud 's Lakota defended so ferociously had been won by them from others . Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Lakota did not make good neighbors . A warrior culture to the bone , they lumped almost all humankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very existence was an excuse for warfare , and warfare was more or less continuous . <p> Like the whites , the Lakota had originated elsewhere . About 1760 , pressed by Cree enemies , the Lakota began to move west from Minnesota onto the Great Plains , where they were attracted to the enormous herds of buffalo . The Oglala Standing Bull discovered the Black Hills in 1776 . <p> With their new source of wealth ( the buffalo ) and new technology ( the horse ) the akota prospered . In the process they displaced the Kiowa and the Arikara , and by mid-century the Lakota and their allies , the Northern Cheyenne , were battling the Crow for traditional Crow hunting grounds . <p> Believing that the buffalo supply would be endless , when white traders wanted buffalo robes , the Lakota provided them in exchange for guns , gunpowder , lead for bullets , and blankets and whiskey . According to University of Montana historian Dan Flores , the Northern Plains Indians shipped 85,000 to 100,000 robes annually to St. Louis throughout the 1840s . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white encroachment for the diminishing buffalo population . <p> Flores says that from 1856 to 1864 severe droughts reduced the buffalo carrying capacity of the Plains by 40 to 60 percent . Altogether too frequently , Indian hunters came home empty-handed . In the Northern Plains , the remaining game found refuge in the Powder River and Tongue River basin-disputed turf that was too dangerous for hunting parties from the warring tribes to enter . <p> Although the treaty of 1851 allotted this country to the Crow , they were driven out of it by expansionist Lakota and Cheyenne . One Cheyenne explained this dynamic simply : " We stole the hunting grounds of the Crow because they the grounds were the best . " And then , along came John Bozeman and his wagon train . All the elements were present for an explosive confrontation between whites and Indians . <p> The infantrymen Capt . William Fetterman mustered at 11 a.m. on December 21 , 1866 , carried Civil War-issue , muzzle-loading Springfield rifles . In expert hands , such rifles could be loaded and fired only three times per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fetterman 's 27 cavalrymen carried Spencer 7-shot breech-loading carbines , and the two civilians who accompanied Fetterman ( because they did n't want to return East without a chance at Indian fighting ) had 16-shot Henry rifles . <p> It was a clear , cold day . Snow lay on the ridges . A woodcutting party had been attacked , and Fetterman went to its aid . Carrington climbed onto the sentry walk to give an order he apparently never dreamed the fire-eating Fetterman might ignore : " Under no circumstances must you cross Lodge Trail Ridge ! " <p> The Bozeman Trail left Fort Phil Kearny , crossed Big Piney Creek and climbed over Lodge Trail Ridge onto a 40-foot-wide spur above Peno Valley . Even now , the ruts of immigrant wagons are visible on that spur . <p> Today the place where they fought is grazing land , and the tall grass that concealed the Indians on both sides of the spur can only be imagined . The battlefield is n't very big-one can walk the interpretive trail in 20 minutes or so . But a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell in a small place . Maybe Fetterman meant to obey his orders , but infuriating Indian decoys dashed just inside easy gunshot range , jeered and fled , shouting vulgar insults , drawing the soldiers into a trap . Fetterman 's cavalrymen were lured away from the wood train , up over Lodge Trail Ridge , down off the spur , until the decoys splashed across icy Peno Creek and signaled to the waiting ambushers to close the trap . <p> When the trap snapped shut , 1,000 Indians rose out of the tall grass ; Oglala and Miniconjou , Lakota , Arapaho and Northern Cheyenne . Terrible yells drowned out officers ' commands . The cavalry apparently broke in terror and fled to refuge among rocks atop the spur a hundred yards above the infantry 's position . The infantrymen kept their discipline longer , firing in volleys , then singly , until they began to run out of ammunition . The knife slash that cut Captain Fetterman 's throat was deep enough to expose his neck vertebrae . <p> The cavalrymen loosed their horses , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these prizes . When their scouts signaled that reinforcements were coming from the fort , the Indians attacked the surviving cavalry with knives and war clubs and lances and hatchets . Altogether , 81 soldiers fell to Red Cloud 's onslaught . ( Colonel Carrington 's initial estimate of 94 dead was mistaken . ) Some 40,000 arrows were fired-a thousand for every minute the fight lasted . <p> When they heard the firing back at Fort Phil Kearny , Jim Bridger was reported to have said , " Yes . It is as I was afraid . " The shots echoed all the way East , where the newspapers told of Fetterman 's awful fate . <p> Western settlers were outraged and terrified . Ragtag militias were formed , and Colorado citizens drummed up $5,000 to purchase Indian scalps . When , in the spring of 1867 , John Bozeman himself was killed by Blackfeet he 'd mistaken for friendly Crow , the settlers ' outcry was enormous . <p> But many Easterners did n't want a protracted Indian war . In March 1867 Congress had carved the South into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . Radical Republicans and President Andrew Johnson were on a collision course over Reconstruction policy , and the Bozeman Trail was not a high national priority . After the Fetterman fight , there were no more immigrant trains up the Bozeman Trail . The trail became a military road , existing only to support those forts originally built to protect it . On July 20 , 1867 , an Indian Peace Commission was authorized to make a treaty with Red Cloud , but Red Cloud rejected its overtures : he would not negotiate peace until the Bozeman Trail had been closed and the forts abandoned . <p> To punctuate Indian defiance , on August 1 and 2 , 1867 , Lakota warriors attacked a haying party at Fort C. F. Smith , and struck a wood party at Fort Phil Kearny in what became known as the Wagon Box Fight . In both , overwhelming numbers of Indians surrounded small parties of whites forted-up behind their wagons . The Indians circled the wagon corrals to draw fire , intending to make their final rush while the whites were reloading their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers had been issued a new breech-loading rifle , the Springfield/Allen modification . The Indians waited in vain for a reloading pause , but the soldiers ' fire was continuous , and after hours of fighting , the Indians were driven off . Some Army men and most Western settlers wanted to press this seeming advantage and mount unremitting war against Red Cloud and his allies . Influential Eastern whites were more pacific , and the government believed , as Red Cloud 's biographer Robert W. Larson has written , " ... it was cheaper to feed Indians than to fight them . " <p> By this time , even the Crow had joined Red Cloud 's demand to close the Bozeman Trail , and in March 1868 , Gen. U. S. Grant gave orders to abandon the forts . Another peace commission-which included Gen. William T. Sherman-traveled to Fort Laramie , where it cooled its heels waiting for Red Cloud , who would n't meet until the forts were actually abandoned and the trail actually closed . <p> On the morning of July 28 , 1868 , at Fort C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The soldiers fell into ranks in heavy field outfit for the 324 mile march to the railroad and as we considered it , civilization . The last hand baggage was loaded and the train formed .... As a final farewell the entire Crow tribe gathered on the plain in gala attire to see the command start . " <p> Not long after the Army abandoned the isolated forts , their Indian allies , the Crow , left too , and at dawn the next day , Red Cloud and his warriors burned C. F. Smith . They went on to burn Fort Phil Kearny a few days later . Red Cloud waited until the Lakota 's fall hunt was concluded before he met with the peace commissioners , but on November 7 , Red Cloud finally signed the treaty . <p> Two years later , Red Cloud and a party of 20 Lakota traveled by train to Washington , D.C. to meet President Grant and confer with the Secretary of the Interior . When his white hosts showed him a 15-inch coastal gun that could fire shells weighing hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be much use against Lakota warriors . But Red Cloud was a realist about white power : " Now we are melting like snow on the hillside , while you are growing like spring grass . " He traveled to New York City , where thousands lined Fifth Avenue to get a glimpse of the man who had destroyed Fetterman . In a speech at Cooper Union the next evening , he said through an interpreter that even though whites were clothed and ate tame meat and Indians were naked and ate wild meat , the Great Spirit wanted them to live in peace . As George A. Custer would discover six years later on the Little Bighorn , this , too , was wishful thinking , although Red Cloud never went to war again . <p> John Bozeman 's trail prompted a war between conflicting visions of prosperity . For the Lakota warrior : limitless buffalo wealth and enough fighting to earn a warrior 's reputation . For the white immigrant : limitless gold , limitless opportunity . Both peoples had gentler visions as well , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bully girl , Jennie , was seeking Canaan , the promised land .
