A number of social conservatives , myself included , have recently been asked to respond to the news that Mary Cheney , the Vice President 's daughter , is pregnant with a child she intends to raise with her lesbian partner . Implicit in this issue is an effort to get us to criticize the Bush Administration or the Cheney family . But the concern here has nothing to do with politics . It is about what kind of family environment is best for the health and development of children , and , by extension , the nation at large . <P> With all due respect to Cheney and her partner , Heather Poe , the majority of more than 30 years of social-science evidence indicates that children do best on every measure of well-being when raised by their married mother and father . That is not to say Cheney and Poe will not love their child . But love alone is not enough to guarantee healthy growth and development . The two most loving women in the world can not provide a daddy for a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be complete role models for a little girl . <P> The voices that argue otherwise tell us more about our politically correct culture than they do about what children really need . The fact remains that gender matters  --  perhaps nowhere more than in regard to child rearing . The unique value of fathers has been explained by Dr. Kyle Pruett of Yale Medical School in his book Fatherneed : Why Father Care Is as Essential as Mother Care for Your Child . Pruett says dads are critically important simply because " fathers do not mother . " Psychology Today explained in 1996 that " fatherhood turns out to be a complex and unique phenomenon with huge consequences for the emotional and intellectual growth of children . " A father , as a male parent , makes unique contributions to the task of parenting that a mother can not emulate , and vice versa . <P> According to educational psychologist Carol Gilligan , mothers tend to stress sympathy , grace and care to their children , while fathers accent justice , fairness and duty . Moms give a child a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong and its consequences . Other researchers have determined that boys are not born with an understanding of " maleness . " They have to learn it , ideally from their fathers . <P> But set aside the scientific findings for a minute . Is n't there something in our hearts that tells us , intuitively , that children need a mother and a father ? Admittedly , that ideal is not always possible . Divorce , death , abandonment and unwed pregnancy have resulted in an ever growing number of single-parent families in this culture . We admire the millions of men and women who have risen to the challenge of parenting alone and are meeting their difficult responsibilities with courage and determination . Still , most of them , if asked , would say that raising children is a two-person job best accomplished by a mother and father .
