A Net of Identity Thieves <P> " Cyberspace thieves are the same as Old West outlaws . The territory is wide open , and the bad guys think they can successfully hide out . " R. JERRY NAEGELE Papillion , Neb . <P> The Internet is n't the secure , democratic information highway we once hoped it would be INTERNET INSECURITY , July 2 , and spying software is now being used by parents to track the activities of their young children surfing the Net . This can be a boon to concerned and vigilant parents who wish to keep the predators and pornographers who lurk in cyberspace away from their kids . SAUL CARTER Modesto , Calif . <P> Preventing computer-network attacks and security breaches is not just a matter of installing the latest technology but also one of information security awareness . Employees are vulnerable to computer virus attacks , laptop theft , et cetera . Everyone needs to be concerned about information security and privacy , not just the technology world . People are the ultimate barrier to information theft . STACEY ESCOFFERY , PRESIDENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing amount of highly personal information that people provide to Web job sites when they post their resume or complete a profile . Many of these sites offer minimal protection of this confidential data , or none at all . Please bring this important risk to your readers ' attention . SUSAN P. JOYCE , PRESIDENT NETability Inc . Marlborough , Mass . <P> I was surprised to learn that my Social Security number is supposed to be confidential . That same Social Security number that I print at the top of all my college term papers , directly beneath my name ? The number that was announced in lieu of my first name when I went to retrieve " confidential " blood-test results ? The number I spout to customer-service representatives who need to verify my identity ? SARA SCHROEDER Newton , Mass . <P>  --  Are you afraid of Internet identity thieves ? Spooked by cyberspies ? We noticed that an unusual number of you , leery perhaps of putting your privacy at risk , withheld your name and address from your letters . Generally we do n't publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . <P> Prevaricating Professor <P> Historian and Mount Holyoke professor Joseph Ellis fabricated stories about his experiences in Vietnam but never saw active duty in the war HISTORY , July 2 . That is a disgrace . Ellis needs to go to the Vietnam Memorial and touch every name on the wall . He will then realize what he has done . SEAN MCMONAGLE Cleveland , Ohio <P> I would n't be overly critical of Ellis ' confabulations in his classroom when he taught about the Vietnam War . I would suspect that he merely animated his topic a bit . True , it 's embarrassing for Ellis  --  and he ought not to have done it  --  but as a mark of scholastic duplicity , it gets a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 . DOUG URBANUS Ben Lomond , Calif . <P> The Yates Tragedy <P> For a woman with a history of self-destructive mental problems like those of Andrea Yates , who drowned her five children NATION , July 2 , dealing with them was certainly stressful enough . But to be home-schooling the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smacks of emotional abandonment . I hate to say this , given the grief her husband must be feeling , but he is either insensitive or incredibly stupid . MARIA SMITH Sycamore , Ill.
