Border-patrol agent Nate Lagasse is sitting quietly in his Toyota Land Cruiser about three miles west of a small Arizona town on the Mexican border , following a group of 12 immigrants through his night-vision goggles . He radios directions to three colleagues , who are out in the mesquite on foot and closing in on the aliens . " They do n't even know we are here yet , " whispers Lagasse , who has turned off his headlights and allowed his truck to roll to a halt without hitting the brakes . " It 's just like hunting . " <P> Something alerts the aliens , and they hit the dirt , probably at the order of the coyote , or guide , they have paid to get them across . But Lagasse has marked their location and talks his three agents in on top of them . After a few minutes , a voice comes over his radio : " We have them now . " The immigrants make no attempt to escape . The sight of a few agents in uniform is often enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained 100 people at once . <P> Between 6 million and 12 million illegal aliens live in the U.S. , the majority are from Mexico and most move through Arizona . It draws more than a third of the illegals , including 14 men who died of dehydration near Yuma after the temperature hit 115degrees two weeks ago . But the busiest place in the state is the tiny border town of Naco , a place so anonymous that its name derives from the last two letters of Arizona and Mexico . Naco ( pop . 800 ) is little more than a bar , a school , a couple of streets and 220 border-patrol agents . Across the line in Mexico is a town with the same name , 10 times the population and all the makings of a first-class staging area  --  guest houses , grocery stores and an army of local guides , or coyotes , to show the way . <P> As soon as the sun goes down , hundreds of men , women and children , armed with water bottles , toothbrushes , toilet paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , come walking , running and crawling north across the border . Each night border-patrol agents round up roughly 500 and next morning return them to Mexico , only to have them start all over again the following evening . It 's a never-ending drill , often with life-and-death stakes . The border patrol says 383 people died last year attempting to cross the border from Mexico . " Is this problem solvable ? " asks Victor Manjarrez , 37 , top agent in the Naco station . " I think we in the border patrol are getting better at what we are doing . But with a Third World economy to the south and a First World economic power to the north , you will always have this problem . " <P> THE GAME Every night a busy industry gears up to test the weak points all along the border 's 1,952 miles . In Tijuana smugglers cram three people into a car trunk and a fourth behind a dashboard , then drive through the customs checkpoint , hoping nobody suspects anything . In Calexico aliens float down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border patrol wo n't jump in to pull them out . In nearby Nogales smugglers tunnel 6 ft. under the border and funnel people through .
