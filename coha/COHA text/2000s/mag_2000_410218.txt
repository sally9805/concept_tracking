// Socially conscious investors are putting their money where their hearts are  --  and getting richly rewarded . Here 's how they 're doing it . Back in 1993 , Sue Kazmaier had logged 12 years in the workforce as a computer network administrator . Because she was hoping to one day start a family , she knew she needed a better return on her money than her meager savings account interest . So she decided to explore the stock market . Her interest was piqued by a discussion with an older colleague about the millions he had accumulated as a result of shrewd stock picking . But when Kazmaier scanned his portfolio for ideas , she discovered that he was heavily invested in corporations that made her queasy : weapons manufacturers , fast-food chains and oil companies . I do n't patronize these products , " she says , " so why would I buy the stocks ? " As a vegetarian with distinct social , health and environmental concerns , Kazmaier realized that investing was a lot more complicated than she 'd originally thought . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings grow without sacrificing her beliefs . And it turns out that she was n't alone in her mission . In fact , socially responsible investing-or SRI-has become one of the hottest trends on the ( Wall ) Street . SRInvesting , basically , is smart investing with a twist . According to Thomas Van Dyck , senior investment consultant at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in San Francisco , " We do the classic financial management techniques but " screen ' for our clients " specific social objectives to filter out non  --  sustainable industries and business practices , such as polluting the environment and conducting poor labor practices . " According to a November 1999 study by the nonprofit Social Investment Forum , one out of every eight dollars under professional financial management in the United States in that fiscal year was intentionally invested in a socially responsible manner . That translates into a total of $2.16 trillion , up 82 percent from 1997 . " People understand that companies and markets have a huge effect on the quality of their lives , " says Dianne Saenz , manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially conscious mutual fund family . " And many people like to buy stock in companies they believe in . " Female investors , with their ever  --  increasing economic power , tend to be particularly attracted to SRI , says Saenz . " Women understand the link between environmental issues and women 's health ; they understand the concepts of economic justice and fairness in the workplace . They also make a lot of consumer decisions for their households and are accustomed to buying products from companies they respect or that have been used in their family 's homes for years . There 's a great deal of brand loyalty . They have just transported that decision-making process to their investment decisions . " SRInvesting can be traced back to the 1700s , when religious groups , such as the Quakers , Mennonites and Episcopalians , refused to invest their money in the production of weapons . SRI did n't become popular for individual investors until the 1960s , however , when a handful of socially responsible mutual funds first became available . In those days , such funds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial world as a group of do-gooders doomed to settle for inferior returns . How times have changed . Not only are investors flocking to SRI , but they 're getting richly rewarded for it  --  by traditional Wall Street measures . The Domini 400 Social Index , which tracks 400 socially responsible stocks the same way the industry benchmark Standard &; Poor 's ( S &P); 500 evaluates the overall performance of the U.S. stock market , has beaten the S &P; every year since its inception in 1990 . In other words , investors have been able to do well while still doing good . Picking and Choosing SRInvesting obviously takes more into account than just a corporation 's bottom line . As Emily Hall , a financial analyst who monitors this category for the mutual fund research firm Morningstar , puts it , " We consider any fund that uses non  --  financial social criteria to be a socially conscious fund . " According to Hall , those criteria can be secular , religious or both . In choosing or rejecting specific stocks or mutual funds , SRInvestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic ways to screen are to : Avoid stocks of companies whose behavior clashes with the investor 's own values ( for example , a clothing company that outsources its manufacturing to sweatshops , or a company that does business with repressive governments ) . Support companies that act in accordance with the investor 's values ( e.g. , power companies that invest in alternative energy sources , or grocery chains that support organic farmers ) . SRInvestors have another powerful tool in their kit . They use the voting power of stock holdings to influence the company to adopt new policies or change its more egregious ones ( such as asking a company to create an internal policy that promotes more diversity at the executive level , or demanding that a relationship with a bank be dropped because it finances companies that produce chemical weapons ) . Since it can be hard work to screen each individual stock , many SRInvestors have turned to mutual funds-basically a managed collection of stocks in which investors pursue " mutual " investment objectives-with specific religious or secular screening criteria . Such funds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SRI 's maturity and mainstream status has been the entry of TIAA-CREF , the world 's largest pension system , and Vanguard , the second  --  largest U.S. company of mutual funds , into the world of socially screened funds . It was with a mutual fund that Kazmaier began her portfolio , choosing the Pax World Fund on the advice of another colleague . " It looks into the environmental and corporate policies of the companies it invests in , " she explains . " They do n't purchase anything in the alcohol , tobacco or armaments areas . " Pax also had a solid , if not spectacular , performance record . Another SRInvestor , Arthur Boyd , helps screen stock investments for the Friends Committee on National Legislation , a Quaker lobby group for which he serves as associate executive secretary . " Our underlying philosophy is that people should make a connection between their money and their values , " says Boyd . Using pacifist Quaker beliefs as a guide , Boyd makes sure the organization 's portfolio avoids companies that manufacture weapons or have military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portfolio to ensure that they conduct sound policies toward the environment , their employees and indigenous peoples . Stand Up and Be Counted Investor activists take SRI a step further by lobbying for change within the corporations whose stocks they hold . Professional investors who control mutual funds or large pension systems have been especially successful in using their holdings for leverage , petitioning companies and even governments to change their ways . The abolition of South Africa 's apartheid system , the mandate to Swiss banks to pay reparations to Holocaust survivors and their families , and the negotiations for peace in Northern Ireland have all been influenced by activist investors who used stock as a negotiating tool . Here 's how it 's done : By law , anyone with $2,000 invested in a company for one year is entitled to file what 's called a shareholder resolution at an annual meeting . The greater the number of shares one has , the greater one 's likelihood of influencing company policy . Sometimes the initiative comes from professional investors , though frequently special-interest groups approach investors for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing a third-party report on a company 's overseas labor practices to getting a commercial food producer to back away from genetically modified crops to discouraging relations with governments known for their poor human rights records . Corporate management often works to keep the resolution off the annual meeting agenda , where friction with shareholders can result in a public black eye for the company . Sometimes the most unlikely stockholders have shown their mettle as investor activists . In 1998 , a group of Dominican nuns from New York and New Jersey whose pension plan was heavily invested in General Electric stock showed up at the annual GE shareholders meeting to demand the company educate the public about the risks of its discharge of industrial waste into local rivers . The resolution was outvoted , but the publicity unified shareholders , including several government pension funds , which has led to a state lawsuit that is still pending . In an **25;389;TOOLONG hookup , Save the Baja Whale Campaign turned to Amy Domini , founder of the Domini 400 and president of Domini Social Equity Funds , and other managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitsubishi , which was building a second salt facility in the Baja region of Mexico . The mere endorsement of the campaign by SRI professional investors earned Domini the right to sit down with Mitsubishi senior management to discuss the environmental impact of their action . Currently , the project is on hold . And in yet another example of investors helping activists gain clout , Patrick McVeigh , of Boston-based Trillium Asset Management , worked with the late Henry Spira , the animal rights activist and Vegetarian Times board member , to petition McDonald 's in 1993 to abide by the animal welfare guidelines promoted by the American Meat Institute ( AMI ) . McDonald 's ended up signing-and abiding by-the resolution , thus setting an important precedent for the rest of the fast-food industry . McVeigh was also behind the recently publicized initiative by the National Rainforest Network to get Home Depot to phase out the purchase of timber from old-growth forests . After months of unproductive individual dialogue , McVeigh took the issue to Home Depot 's annual meeting , where the proposed resolution got a significant vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that it would stop purchasing wood from many sensitive environmental areas by the year 2002 . McVeigh feels that shareholder activism has increased the attractiveness of SRI . " It 's not just that investors , will feel better by not investing in tobacco , " he says . " By investing this way , they can actually make companies better . It 's another way to bring about change . " At the very least , SRI helps goad corporations into greater disclosure and accountability . " SRInvestors create a marketplace demand for information , " says Domini . " You now have a bus driver in Cincinnati knowing as much about , or being capable of knowing as much about , the inside of a financial hall of power as some supposedly big-shot policy wonk . " Getting Your Feet Wet To begin investing responsibly , you need to use both your head and your heart . You can start simply by screening out stocks you do n't want in your portfolio . According to the Social Investment Forum , 96 percent of socially screened portfolios avoid tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol , 83 percent for weapons and 79 percent for the environment . Other screens include human rights ( 43 percent ) , labor issues ( 38 percent ) , birth control/abortion ( 23 percent ) and animal welfare ( 15 percent ) . In addition to screening out stocks , you can reward good corporate citizens by buying their stock . Ironically , many SRInvestors choose classic Wall Street corporations because of their exemplary records . IBM , for example , began auditing its own environmental conduct about five years ago and now reports on it annually to shareholders . Another technology company , Hewlett  --  Packard , has set high environmental standards and implemented model energy-efficiency programs , which have actually improved their profitability . You can also help support new companies that would n't ordinarily be able to get funded through traditional financing channels . For example , Calvert Group offers a " special equity " program that allocates a portion of investor dollars to companies like Fran 's Healthy Helpings , a frozen-food company that offers low-salt , low-sugar meals that are affordable to lower- and middle-income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , use issues you have supported in the past as guideposts . Contact professional organizations you admire , such as the Humane Society , Sierra Club or Planned Parenthood , and find out which corporations have subsidized their causes-or which corporations they feel should be avoided . Read the newspaper and surf the Web to determine whether the company in which you 'll potentially buy stock has a clean record . You can even call a company 's investor-relations department , whose sole purpose is to provide answers to people who are interested in their stock . If you 're thinking of buying mutual funds , take a careful look at the criteria the fund manager uses to screen the stocks he or she purchases . For example , Morningstar 's Hall points out that a number of funds of interest to vegetarians because they screen for animal testing and avoid meat producers ( such as the Capstone Fund ) might technically still invest in , say , oil companies or nuclear power . " You can end up with absolutely opposite mandates , " she warns , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want from a fund and whether or not that fund actually does that . " Luckily , most funds are forthcoming about their disclosure practices , often posting their holdings on their Web sites or in published materials such as their fund prospectus or annual report . And yet , says Boyd . " you ca n't be 100 percent pure . Even the best investor ca n't be in touch with every single thing that 's going on in a public company . " Trust Your Gut After beginning with a mutual fund , Kazmaier built her portfolio on the companies , industries and products that she knew best . " At work , I do all the computer hardware and software support and network administration , so technology is the area in which I am the most knowledgeable , " she points out . That led her to buy technology  --  oriented stocks such as Lucent , Qwest and Microsoft . Lucky for her , they 've been skyrocketing recently . She remains vigilant about their operations , though , because she knows that certain technology companies accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decision to purchase shares in the natural food supermarket chain Whole Foods was sparked by being a satisfied customer . " I 've held on to that stock because I believe that the trend of baby boomers getting into healthier products is just nor going to go away , " she says . " Health food , natural products , organic products and vitamin supplements-I think theyll be more and more of a fixture in people 's lives . " Kazmaier makes all her purchases through a discount broker or an online trading account and plans to hold each of her stocks for three to five years . At her job she also invests in a 401 ( k ) and has put some of her money into real estate as a cushion against a stock market downturn . In roughly a three-year period , her combined investments have brought her a return of 92 percent , her best-performing stock having started at $2,500 and now valued at $21,000 . Not bad for a do-it-yourself stock picker , who has the added bonus of a clear conscience . Critics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SRI category charge slightly higher fees than their traditional counterparts . Hall attributes this to the extraordinary research required to screen each company and the extra resources needed ta pursue activist measures . But Kazmaier does n't mind paying a few more bucks to make worthy investments instead of supporting the environmental or societal damage caused by other companies . " We 're going to end up paying for it one way or another , " she says .

Sidebar A MAN , A PLAN ... Still wary about investing in capitalist economics ? You 're not alone , To prove that one can invest in the stock market without betraying his values , we recruited the most socially conscious and demanding potential investor we knew-our own Derek Hansen-and asked a professional investment manager work up a strategy that met Derek 's criteria . Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took on the task . By the way , before going on to manage $600 million in assets and filing precedent-setting shareholder resolutions , McVeigh got his start managing a small California food co-op . INVESTOR PROFILE Derek Hansen , 27 , single ; vegan raw foodist ; associate art director , Vegetarian Times . FINANCIAL GOALS : To earn between 10 and 15 percent on invested funds ; willing to take risks ; suspicious of bank investments . LIFESTYLE GOALS : To " retire " to a self-sufficient farm in 5 to 10 years . Willing to work part-time if necessary . POSITIVE SCREENS : Companies involved in bicycles , alternative energy , the use of recycled materials ; health food stores ; organic produce ; animal rights . NEGATIVE SCREENS : Companies dealing in animal agriculture/testing , products made in sweatshops , weapons , genetic engineering , pharmaceuticals , environment-destroying crops like tobacco , coffee , bananas . ASSETS : $79,000 in bank CDs ; $5,000 in a savings account ; $5,000 in Qwest Communications stock . McVEIGH 'S ANALYSIS " Because Derek needs access to this money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stocks , since the market could experience a downturn . But Sidebar $40,000 is n't enough to build a diversified portfolio , so I suggest mutual funds . Unfortunately , most invest in pharmaceutical companies , but there are two that should meet his criteria : Portfolio 21 and IPS Millennium , both run by vegetarians who use animal-rights screens and have strong pro-environmental policies . " Portfolio 21 ( www.portfolio21.com ) is a new fund and invests in firms that have adopted strong environmental sustainability policies . I would invest $5,000 to $10,000 here . IPS Millennium ( www.ipsfunds.com ) has a terrific recent track record and an interesting strategy of investing in aggressive technology and conservative utility companies . I would recommend $10,000 to $15,000 in this fund . Qwest is a leading telecommunications company and I recommend holding on to this stock . " This leaves a balance of about $10,000. 1 would suggest investing equal amounts in these other solidly performing SR stocks such as Whole Foods Markets , the leading U.S. natural food supermarket ; Lifeline Systems , the leading company in the personal-response monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels industry ; and Celestial Seasonings , the herbal tea company with a growing presence in herbal medicinal supplements . " The remaining $49,000 should stay liquid , ideally in CDs in community-based banks like ShoreBank Pacific ( ecobank@aone.com ) , which supports environmentally sensitive businesses in the Pacific Northwest . But with inflation on the rise , CDs wo n't allow Derek 's money to grow in value . If it turns out he does n't need access to his money within three years , I 'd recommend increasing his investment in stocks-the best way to strengthen his purchasing power and prepare for retirement .
