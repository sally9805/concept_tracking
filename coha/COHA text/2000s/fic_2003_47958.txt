You should n't play with fire . " Lena leans over Ivan 's shoulder and blows out the votive candle over which he is passing his index finger back and forth . She jiggles her arm nervously , and the silver bracelet slides beneath her sleeve . She looks around her . Everywhere there is plenty . The people are fat . How can some have so much and others so little ? The sun is low in the sky outside the airport lounge 's long windows . There 's still enough light to catch on Lena 's earring as it tucks in and out of her platinum hair . The reflection flickers on Ivan 's face ; his pale eyes move from the wisp of candle smoke to Lena 's hair . One strand would light a room . Would illuminate one 's way . <p> The room is dark as night although outside the sun shines on the bare branches encased in ice . Princess Elena sleeps under eider down quilts , behind thick brocade drapes , and dreams about violets blooming in the snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fur-lined boots , in a fur hat , her hands in a fur muff . She picks her way through the blossoms with cheeks flushed by the cold , no , with excitement , no , by love . She is walking toward her love . She cant see him , but he waits for her at the edge of the field , at the edge of the forest . <p> A white wolf leads her journey through the field . He speaks to her , saying , " Follow me . You 'll be glad . " When he turns to look at her , his pale eyes are older than her grandmother 's , the oldest eyes she knows . They are kind as her mother's-the queens-the kindest eyes she knows . They are strong as her father's-the king's-the strongest eyes she knows . His paws are graceful as they rise , hang limp in the air , and softly fall . Where they land , violets appear-a delicate path leading to the forest , to an unknown love . <p> Inside , it is dark as night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and looks at Ivan sideways . <p> " So , do you think I 'm done for ? " she asks in Russian . <p> Ivan looks straight ahead , as if he 's looking to see someone he knows in this strange airport , in this strange land . " What do I know ? " he answers . <p> " You know your brother . " She spits the words at him in English . <p> " Nyet , " he replies , still looking at no one , still forcing his eyes nowhere . <p> " Why did n't he just send me tickets ? " She pauses . " You Know . " <p> She looks down at her hands , her hair covering her face . Lena feels like crying . Her fingers are laced , slowly extending and retracting . She is thinking ahead . Her mind races beyond the flight with its constant offer of cold champagne , warm nuts , hot towels , ice cream . Her thoughts fly faster than the speed of light , much faster than the plane with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond her dreams , the tiny , white pill , the groggy wakening to the voice in her ear announcing . She is past the landing , the crush of people on the stairs , behind the red line , across it , the thud of the stamp , the non-smiling face behind the glass . There she is . She sees herself standing beside the perfume stall , staring at the door beyond nothing to declare . It is dark . Dread waits in the shadows . It blocks her path . She ca n't think past the Moscow airport carousel spinning with so many futures except her own . <p> Prince Ivan watches from behind the boulder as the white wolf comes closer and closer . The prince has been walking , lost in circles for hours , his horse having been torn to bits by the wolf as it stood drinking from a forest pool while Ivan slept in a nearby tree , tied to the branches to keep from falling . The shrieks woke him . In his dreams , he blindly slashed out at what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale eyes in the dying light . He rests his hand on the bloodied saddle and bridle beside him . He thinks of his horse nuzzling his face just yesterday , the warm breath down his collar against the cold . His poor horse . Bits of horse flesh still cling to the white coat skulking toward him . He holds the hilt of his sword tight in his left hand . His arm freezes in midair . The wolf looks at him and smiles . <p> The wolf speaks . " I want to make amends . " <p> Ivan touches her arm . <p> " It 's time to go . " <p> She looks up at him quickly and nods . <p> " I 'm going to the bathroom first . " She fumbles with her backpack . <p> " Be back in five minutes . " He looks into her eyes . She wo n't run . He almost wishes she would . Lena nods again . He watches her out of the corner of his eye trained on Sports Illustrated . She disappears down a hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror without recognizing the face in front of her . Her heart is broken . <p> Ivan sees her as soon as she reappears . He rises and rolls the magazine in his hands . She notices him at the last minute , just as he 's close enough to take her arm . They have only one carry-on between them-her backpack . He needs no weapon and has not been in America long enough to require even a duffel bag . <p> He bends slightly and says into her ear , " He did n't send tickets because you would n't have come . " She shrugs in acknowledgement . <p> He hesitates before he speaks again . He should n't be talking . <p> " He 'll probably beat you . " He states this as a fact ; he offers it to her . <p> " How many times ? " she asks bitterly . <p> " As many times as he wants , " Ivan says simply . <p> " If I had a choice between being a whore in America or your brother Ivanovich 's whore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front of her coat . He can barely hear her . <p> " You do n't , " he says . <p> The wolf runs over mountains and swims rivers with the prince on his back . He trudges through snow and ice . Ivan clings to the wolf 's back and burrows his face in the white coat . He does n't know where he is going or for what purpose . He is trusting a wolf who killed his horse . He is tired and wants to sleep , but dares not for fear of falling . Finally , the wolf slows , and then stops . Ivan rolls in exhaustion from his back . <p> Hours later , he wakes to the wolf licking his face . Ivan looks around . They are in a courtyard . There are fruit trees and waterfalls . It is the courtyard of a palace . Ivan walks toward the tile terrace . Hanging from one of the archways is a golden cage . In the cage , there is a magnificent bird with feathers ablaze with a golden sheen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and is surprised to see stars . It is night , but the courtyard shines with the plumage as if it were day . <p> " Set it free , " the wolf says . <p> Ivan looks at the wolf . <p> " Set it free , " the wolf repeats . <p> Ivan closes his eyes and leans back in his seat . Lena has already fallen asleep , having taken a pill with her tea and water and orange . <p> He remembers how she loves oranges . When they were little together , after her parents were killed , for Christmas they would sometimes have oranges . Her face lit up , her golden hair , the juice running down her chin-Ivan gave her his orange more than once just to bathe in the aura of her . Not so with his brother . He teased her even then . He sighs and opens his eyes . <p> She has no other relatives , no one except for his brother and him . And his brother wants her , has always wanted her . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky to be off the streets , except those times when the boys ' mother came back with a client ; then they waited in the front doorway and huddled to keep from freezing . <p> Ivan switches through the channels of movies . It could be worse . She is just another broad who ran to New York with all the money she could get her hands on . Yet even as he looks at her in the darkened plane , her hair is like a halo around her head , her ribs through her sweater , a breathing cage for her heart . <p> Ivan was n't lying when he told Lena his brother would beat her . He would beat her before he killed her . Ivan felt his eyes burn . <p> In her dreams , Princess Elena is coming closer and closer to the edge of the wood . But instead of becoming clearer , the figure is moving farther into the darkness . She can only see the flash of a white tail , a pale light , and runs not to lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle . She believes the ogre has a spell on her , making it so to step one foot outside is impossible . And here she is , following a white wolf that peers over his shoulder to make sure she does n't lag behind . Just as the ogre 's spell held her captive , the white wolf 's spell sets her free . She follows close as she can , her outstretched hands holding the luminescent violets she 's picked along the way . <p> As she goes deeper and deeper in the forest , she drops them , one by one . She does n't know any longer who is the captor and who is the captive . Now , she can only see the wolf in flickers , fireflies against the black and dark green . But she can hear him , like the wind , rustling along the forest floor . She walks softly , dropping her violets , as if she were in prayer . The faces of the saints flash through her thoughts , and then all goes dark . Elena moans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Through her lids she senses light . Slowly , she opens her eyes . Her white wolf is there with a young man , one hand on the wolf 's neck , the other holding a feather that glows like the full moon in February . <p> Ivan nudges Lena awake . <p> " We 'll be in Amsterdam in half an hour . " <p> Lena straightens in her chair and rings for the steward . <p> " Voda , " she says in a raspy voice . " Sok . " <p> The steward quickly returns with bottled water and juice and just as quickly moves away . <p> Ivan leans over so closely his lips are touching her hair . <p> " I 'm only going to say this once . Here is your passport and ticket . Here is $10,000 American . When we land , get off . You know what to do . I do n't want to see you again . Ever . " <p> She looks at his eyes . She has never really looked at them before . They are pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never look a wolf in the eye . " She touches his cheek . It is the first time he has ever been touched with love . It is the first time she has ever touched anyone with tenderness . <p> " You ca n't do this . " It is the only thing she can think to say . " Come with me , " she adds . <p> " I have no choice , " he says ironically , knowing that it 's true , even though he could walk off the plane with her . " I 'll say you gave me the slip . " <p> " He wo n't believe you . " <p> " No , he wo n't . " <p> Lena signals for the steward again . <p> " Vodka , " she says . <p> Ivan looks out the window . In fifteen minutes , she 'll be gone . He wo n't look for her again . The hole in his chest will be there forever . The bullet that Ivanovich will put through it will be nothing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he 's been waiting for all his life . <p>
