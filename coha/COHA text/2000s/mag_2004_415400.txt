Designer KATE SPADE brings a dash of her trademark whimsy to a Park Avenue classic . BY ANNETTE TAPERT // Buying an apartment in New York City has never been an exact science . But most New Yorkers will tell you that the hunt usually begins by falling in love with a neighborhood . Not so for designer Kate Spade ; space and layout were her driving forces . " We put the search out all over , " says Kate , who was assisted throughout by her husband and longtime business partner , Andy , soon to be stepping down from his role as CEO of Kate Spade . " We had lived in a loft , and I liked the idea of having rooms again and moldings . " Though she had no preconceived idea about location , she knew exactly what kind of space she wanted-one untouched by decorators and architects . " We did n't want to pull out someone else 's renovation , " Kate explains . In 1999 she found her ideal on the Upper East Side : a threebedroom , 3,000-square-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-lift in forty years . " We wanted fewer bedrooms and bigger spaces , " she says . " Some of the apartments uptown had been chopped up to make a lot of little bedrooms , and initially it made us think we could n't live up here . " Kate does n't exactly fit the profile of the standard Upper East Sider . Her two freestanding shops in Manhattan ( Kate Spade and Jack Spade ) are in SoHo . The company is headquartered in the Platiron District . Add the fact that Kate has spent a good part of her seventeen years in Manhattan living below Houston Street-and the incongruities are not lost on her . " In New York , people like to stereotype you by where you live , " she observes/Our downtown friends kept saying , Oh , uptown , that 's so provincial ; it 's not very modern . ' It 's so silly to be judged by your neighborhood . When I was growing up in Kansas City , you told people where you lived and they said , Oh , okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear this tone in their voices . It 's ridiculous . " Ludicrous it is , especially when you consider that Kate has been reinterpreting and redefining tradition since 1993 , the year she launched her first collection of handbags . Though the bags remain so classic in shape and so practical that they could have been designed by a Junior League matron , they are infused with wit , whimsy and strokes of bold color that make them anything but provincial . The playful yet elegant designs in a variety of evergreen textures and patterns-Harris Tweed , pony skin , graphic printed canvas-have been embraced by women of a variety of ages and zip codes and have made Kate Spade one of the great fashion success stories of the last decade . Now a $125 million business , the Kate Spade line includes shoes , eyewear , luggage , stationery , beauty products , bed linens , a tabletop collection and a soon-to-be launched collection of textiles and wallpapers produced by Scalamandr . The journey to the top has taken all the proverbial twists and turns that a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big city , including a sojourn in a matchbox-sized studio in TriBeCa where the kitchen and bathroom occupied the same space and , as Kate recalls , the cocktail sauce was next to the toothpaste . Her current apartment happens to mirror her long-held design philosophy : take a conventional structure and use your imagination to breathe new life , along with a touch of eccentricity , into it by creating personality through decoration-the art , objects and furniture that have been collected over time . " The apartment is a great backdrop for what we like to do , " Kate says . " Architecturally , it 's very simple . It 's all about the things you put in . " By New York standards , the renovation of the estatecondition prewar space was tame . Kate did nothing structurally ambitious ; rather , the standard makeover included rewiring , updating the bathrooms and the air-conditioning system , installing a new kitchen and floors and freshening up the old plaster walls . " Kate and Andy wanted to hold on to the prewar feeling , " says Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment and has also worked with the Spades on several of their ten stores around the country , as well as their Manhattan showroom . " Kate wanted the apartment to look timeless . Retaining its original character so that it would remain the way she found it was a challenge . In order to modernize it , we had to rip it apart and then put it back the way it had been . That was difficult but also one of the most alluring aspects of the project . " case in point were the hardwood floors : the original boards , which had seen better days , were replaced with new ones that are the same size , shape and color as their predecessors . The only structural changes were the conversion of one bedroom into a library-Sclaroff knocked down a wall so that the new library now opens onto the spacious living room-and the widening of a passage between the dining and living rooms . He also installed mirrored French doors in the passage , which he painted a glossy black . " The idea came from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer . " The black paint gives the doors a graphic quality . " With taste oozing from their fingertips and a renovation that took the equivalent of a New York minute ( actually , twelve months ) , why did it then take the Spades almost three years to decorate the apartment ? " We did n't focus on it full-time because we needed to run the business , " says Kate matter-of-factly . " We " worked on it piecemeal , as we liked and as we found things . We hit some bumps and changed our minds . " This approach echoes the " way they built their company : gradually , conservatively and in directions unique to them . Kate innately understood that for a home to take on the character of its owner , the decoration should evolve over time . At one point , Sclaroff recalls , the dining-room walls looked as though they were covered in blue Rothkos because the couple were auditioning so many color options .

Sharing equal time in the mix are African sculpture and esoteric objects like a wood assemblage , found in a TriBeCa shop , that " looks like a Picasso but is obviously not . " This room and its equally eclectic fellows add up to a distinctive decor that is both sophisticated and refreshingly unpretentious . " The apartment is aesthetically inclusive without being kaleidoscopic , " says Sclaroff . " It 's the backdrop for two personalities . It 's neither trendy nor conventional . " A fear of convention definitely contributed to the Spades ' meandering pace . " I think you have to be careful in an apartment like this , " says Kate , " not to come off frumpy . Suddenly you 're starting to try to fit into the setting . But you do n't want it to be your parents ' space , so you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate became interested in developing a new line of fabrics and wall-papers , currently in the works . The idea was born out of her increasing frustration at not finding what she wanted in the design marketplace : materials that struck a balance between the modern and the traditional , that did n't telegraph a sense of a specific time and place . The primary objective in all this was to create a comfortable home rather than one that was merely an extension of the business . The wall-to-wall carpeting in the bedroom is just one expression of a desire for coziness . It may be a bow to convention , but in concept only . True to type , the choice has a lot of snap , for it is a graphic needlepoint carpet in yellow , black and ivory-a favorite color combination often found in Kate 's handbag collection . In the end , the home charts the evolving course of two lives , both personal and professional .

I did n't want it to look like a design show house . It 's nice to see layers in how people live . " Sidebar " Kate and Andy like graphic things , " says Steven Sclaroff , the Manhattan designer and antiques dealer who worked on the apartment . For the living room , Sclaroff chose simple white curtains ( a Manuel Canovas cotton/linen blend , trimmed in black Scalamandr tape ) to keep the focus on a Richard Serra paintstick drawing over the mantel . The armchairs , in a yellow silk brocade from Cowtan and Tout , are Swedish , the coffee table English in the Chinese style , the sofa American Empire and the carpet an Aubusson .
