<p> &lt;&gt; In your left hand , you hold an NCAA tournament bracket . In your right , a satellite-dish remote . You 're about to take a tour of heaven : 32 games in the most exhilarating two-day ride in all of sports . Ah , but where to stop ? There are so many stars , so many story lines , so many Cinderellas-in-waiting . The key is a solid game plan . USA TODAY 's Steve Wieberg plots your course to maximum viewing pleasure . &lt;&gt; <p> Thursday12:20 p.m . All times Eastern <p> Kentucky vs . St. Bonaventure <p> ( at Cleveland ) You 're thinking the Wildcats are down , that this is n't their year . Well , last year was not supposed to be either , and they still came within eight points of the Final Four . Put nothing past coach Tubby Smith , whose stare alone can instill a fear of God  --  and failure  --  in his players . <p> 12:40 p.m . Texas vs . Indiana State <p> ( at Salt Lake City ) Oklahoma vs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipping . First , go to the Longhorns and 7-foot Chris Mihm , the best pure center in college basketball . Then to Oklahoma and Eduardo Najera , the best player ever to come out of Mexico and who carried the Sooners into the Sweet 16 a year ago . They are two reasons the Big 12 was so good this season . Najera , you might recall , was knocked silly in a collision with Michigan State 's Mateen Cleaves in the 1999 Midwest Regional semifinals , suffering a concussion , sternoclavicular strain and chipped tooth , but gritted out a return before game 's end . <p> 2:40 p.m . Syracuse vs . Samford <p> ( at Cleveland ) Time to start trolling for upsets . Samford seems a candidate to pull one off , a 13th seed that got its feet wet in the tournament in a loss to St. John 's last year , then came back to beat the Red Storm in this season 's opener . The Bulldogs are the nation 's most prolific three-point shooting team and they are hot , winning nine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , suffering one of only three losses in history to a 15th seed ( Richmond in 1991 ) . <p> 2:45 p.m . Iowa State vs . <p> Central Connecticut State <p> ( at Minneapolis ) You 've been wondering about the second-seeded Cyclones and their superstar forward , Marcus Fizer . Are they as good as you have heard ? Steal away from Samford and Syracuse for an introductory glimpse , and you 'll see . They are every bit as good . <p> 7:40 p.m . Michigan State vs . Valparaiso <p> ( at Cleveland ) Start the evening with a warm memory . Valpo and its homespun coach , Homer Drew , were a tournament sensation two years ago , riding a 13th seed and a miracle into the Sweet 16 . It has spun another nice story this season , turning around a 2-6 start to earn its fifth consecutive NCAA bid  --  but only a 16th seed . Michigan State wo n't take long to complete the return to reality . <p> 7:50 p.m . Louisville vs . Gonzaga <p> ( at Tucson ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent Cinderella , the Zags , who played within six points of last season 's Final Four . Forward Casey Calvary is back from that team , so are guards Matt Santangelo and Richie Frahm , and they are capable of taking at least a first step in the same direction . <p> 10 p.m . Wisconsin vs . Fresno State <p> ( at Salt Lake City ) A little mood music would be nice . Slip the Jaws soundtrack into the CD player , then tune into Jerry Tarkanian 's return to the tournament . The last time we saw Fresno 's towel-chewing coach in one of these games , he was in the ' 91 Final Four with UNLV and still going toe-to-toe with the NCAA . Hmm , those selection committee members would not have taken any delight in matching his high-scoring Bulldogs against one of the most deliberate , defense-minded teams in the country , would they ? <p> 10:15 p.m . UCLA vs . Ball State <p> ( at Minneapolis ) UCLA roared into the tournament , fortified by the reinstatement of star sophomore JaRon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced by lower-seeded teams four times in the first round in the ' 90s . Peek in from time to time just to make sure they have not lapsed into bad habits . <p> FRIDAY12:15 p.m . Illinois vs . Pennsylvania <p> ( at Winston-Salem , N.C. ) Your last chance , for the time being , to see Michael Jordan in a college uniform . That would be Penn 's MJ , who forms a pretty good senior backcourt with Matt Langel , complemented inside by athletic freshman Ugonna Onyekwe . The Quakers are a threat , steeling themselves with early games at Kentucky , Auburn and Kansas , losing by only four at Temple , then winning their last 16 games en route to the Ivy League championship . <p> 12:30 p.m . Cincinnati vs . UNC-Wilmington <p> ( at Nashville ) " How do they know how good we are without Kenyon ? " says Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins , objecting to a demotion to a No. 2 seed in the wake of Kenyon Martin 's broken leg . If the Bearcats are as eager to provide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCAA appearance in the wrong place at the wrong time . Give things , oh , 10 minutes or so to get out of hand , and go back to Illinois-Penn . <p> 2:35 p.m . Florida vs . Butler <p> ( at Winston-Salem ) By now , we know whether Illinois survived . A Florida victory could secure an intriguing second-round matchup with the Illini and their coach , Lon Kruger , who previously coached the Gators and steered them to their only Final Four in 1994 . But there 's also the matter of surviving Butler , an almost perfectly balanced team making its third NCAA appearance in four years . <p> 2:50 p.m . Connecticut vs . Utah State <p> ( at Birmingham , Ala . ) Utah State can throw a little ( Bernard ) Rock and ( Troy ) Rolle at you ; the senior small forward and junior guard are averaging nearly a combined 22 points . But the Aggies are no gim me . They are one of the nation 's stingiest defensive teams , a mere two-point loser to Florida early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak . Defending national champion UConn hardly drew a first-round walk-through . <p> 7:40 p.m . Kansas vs . DePaul <p> ( at Winston-Salem ) Potentially one of the first round 's most competitive games . Notably , too , Kansas coach Roy Williams returns to North Carolina , where he once worked at Dean Smith 's side and still is highly coveted as North Carolina 's future coach . Win this game , and then somehow win the next vs. top-seeded Duke , and see covetousness turn to a craving . <p> 7:55 p.m . North Carolina vs . Missouri <p> ( at Birmingham ) Drop in on one of the nation 's hot young coaches , Missouri 's 33-year-old Quin Snyder , who has the Tigers firing threes and playing impressive defense . Oh yeah , he also used to play a little ( for Duke , going 5-5 against archrival Carolina ) and spent four years as an assistant to the Blue Devils ' Mike Krzyzewski ( again going 5-5 against the Tar Heels ) . <p> 10 p.m . Duke vs . Lamar <p> ( at Winston-Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Start with the top-seeded Blue Devils , and stay just long enough to see them put away the team with the tournament 's worst record ( 15-15 ) . Five to 10 minutes should do . Then move on to the Hoosiers and coach Bob Knight , who are trying to win in the tournament for only the third time in six years . A fourth time in seven years is not a gim me . <p> 10:10 p.m . Miami , Fla. , vs . Arkansas <p> ( at Nashville ) Do the Razorbacks , after playing four games in four days to win the Southeastern Conference tournament , have another 40 minutes of hell in them ? If so , do they have 80 ? Round 2 awaits .
