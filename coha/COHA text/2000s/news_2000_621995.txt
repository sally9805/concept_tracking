<p> Vince King scoured Bay Area garage sales , looking for a lamp for his home . For $50 , he found a real conversation piece  --  a funky copper lamp that was bulbish at one end and flared out through the lamp shade . <p> Little did he know his lamp was a gold mine in disguise . <p> " I saw the same lamp in Architectural Digest and knew it had to be worth something , " King says . Like others in the growing legions seeking fortune  --  sometimes unrealistically  --  in their attics and garages , he decided to see what it was worth . <p> King got the lamp out of a storeroom last summer and had it appraised by Butterfield &; Butterfield , where an installment of HGTV 's " Appraise It ! " was being taped . It turned out to be an original Dirk van Erp design made in the early 1900s and was valued between $8,000 and $12,000 . <p> Antiques , family heirlooms and relics that would usually go untouched for years , left in attics or basements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shows such as " Appraise It ! " and PBS 's " Antiques Roadshow . " The big players , such as Butterfield 's , Sotheby 's and Christie 's , regularly participate in the shows , adding to the hope  --  and the hype . <p> The hype surrounding " Antiques Roadshow " went up a notch recently , after revelations that the show faked an antique owner 's reaction . On a 1997 segment , a man showed an appraiser a Civil War sword he said he found in his attic . The appraiser seemed delighted and told the man it was worth $35,000 . Turns out , the man with the sword was a friend of the appraiser 's business partner , and the whole scene was staged . The producers severed tied with that appraiser and his partner , but pointed out the sword was indeed valuable . <p> And that potential to find something of value is what drives such shows ' popularity , says Avelino Pombo , associate producer of " Appraise It ! " , produced in Corte Madera by Edelman Associates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our show , it 's like winning the lottery . " <p> However , the likelihood of discovering something old is valuable  --  like on " Roadshow , " where an unlikely looking crooked chest of drawers may be appraised for thousands of dollars  --  is slim , industry experts say . <p> " If there 's a deception , that 's it , " says Kathryn Hobart , president of Hobart Associates Inc. , a San Francisco-based appraisal business . " It 's probably 99 to 1 that you have something that is rare or worth a lot of money . <p> " It may have sentimental value , but that does n't mean it 'll translate into market value , though the shows seem to do a good job of explaining that it 's valuable for family reasons versus historical reasons . " <p> Even viewers without hidden potential treasures find it interesting to hear the stories , tales and history behind a piece of art or an antique . Whatever the reason for tuning in , the shows lure viewers and participants en masse . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the most popular show on PBS . When PBS airs even a rerun , the phones at Butterfield 's ring off the hook the next day , says Levi Morgan , Butterfield 's public relations director . <p> " Appraise It ! " gets about 25 queries a week , up from 10 a week last year . <p> HIDDEN ASSETS <p> Some people definitely get lucky . <p> Pombo talks about Susan Buhai of Los Angeles , who wanted to get two of her paintings appraised on " Appraise It ! " She brought them to the clinic in grocery bags and said she acquired them from an aunt and kept them in her garage because she thought they were unattractive . A Butterfield 's print expert looked them over , determining one was worth $15,000 and the other , $20,000 . <p> But there are stories viewers never see . About 3,000 people show up for each " Antiques Roadshow " taping , yet only 15 are selected to be on each show . The rest get appraisals with the same attention , but without the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Appraise It ! " appraisal clinic , only about 20 to 30 of them make it into the show 's segments . <p> " We try to get a broad spectrum of different items on our show , and we try not to do the same thing twice , " Pombo says . " And items are n't selected necessarily because they 're worth something . There might be an interesting story behind it , too . " <p> There also might be the disappointment of reality . <p> " Some people earnestly believe their items are worth $20,000 , but then the appraiser tells them there were thousands of reproductions and it 's really worth $10 , " says Morgan . <p> On the other hand , it would seem to the viewer that most of the items on the shows garner high appraisal values . " If someone sees a Tiffany lamp appraised for $40,000 or $50,000 and they think they have that same lamp at home , they may not be aware that they possess a reproduction , and that 's difficult to explain to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Appraise It ! ' and others try to educate the viewer on how to look for authenticity . " <p> Julie Dixon , another " Appraise It ! " producer , says the show 's appraisers " err on the conservative side , not only because we do n't want to disappoint clients , but we want them to be sure it 's of fair market value and we do n't want to give false hope . " <p> LOTS OF RESEARCH <p> The television version of the appraisal process looks quick and simple , but it 's not that way at all , industry experts say . While some objects are appraised easily because of their commonness , others require thorough research . <p> " A specialist has a deep knowledge of their area . If you 've been in a field for a number of years , you 've seen all sorts of variations of the same items and are able to quickly appraise it , " says Jennifer Biederbeck , vice president of Sotheby 's in San Francisco . " But other areas demand much more research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . " <p> Appraisals takes several hours , if not several days , to evaluate and assess each object adequately . In TV time , it 's an unrealistic matter of seconds . <p> Not only does an appraisal consider an item 's desirability , but it also takes into account the rarity , condition and overall quality . <p> The appraisals on these shows are considered to be auction estimates or fair market values , which is the general wholesale value and not necessarily retail value . Yet a formal appraisal is a legal document detailing the piece and footnoted by catalogs and records as documentation . A formal appraisal is guaranteed by an auction house as well . <p> Whether you 're an avid viewer of appraisal shows or are addicted to ebay 's auction site ( see " Wired but Wary Buyingr " on this page ) , one thing 's certain : The appraisal industry of yesteryear has undergone a dramatic change and promises to become even more accessible and understandable to even the most amateur collector . <p> WHAT 'S IT WORTH ? <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" <p> Kathryn Hobart , president of Hobart Associates Inc. , a San Francisco-based appraisal firm , also sees it changing the way prices are bid for antiques and collectibles and the sheer number of bidders . <p> " On eBay , it 's such an erratic bidding process , " she says . " Their values are n't necessarily comparable to ours ( in the industry ) , but ultimately they could become the norm . " <p> The norm , as Hobart calls it , could become a higher price than is usual for antiques and collectibles . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an unusually high price . Levi Morgan , of Butterfield 's in San Francisco , worries that people who do n't understand the principles of appraising may pay more online than an antique is worth . <p> MOVING UPSCALE <p> EBay recently began hosting a separate component called Great Collections , where the finest of arts and antiques are sold at auction . <p> Butterfield 's became an eBay company last year , opening a whole new world to this traditional and revered auction house . <p> Besides driving business up , the prices of some items have been driven up through online bidding , and this concerns some in the industry . " It does have the ability to create unrealistic prices in some sense , " Morgan says . " Hopefully if people are paying the high prices for items , they know what they 're buying , including the condition and rarity of it . " <p> An item that has not been appraised in person could have an overestimated value . For example , an appraiser with only a photo of a lamp might not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> COMPARISON SHOPPING <p> Nevertheless , many people are now looking to eBay not to purchase an antique , but to compare prices of items similar to theirs . Instead of going through an appraisal , people can find out the going price of their item by just checking out bids . <p> However , many experts are critical of buying  --  or appraising  --  an item solely based on an online photo . For an auction estimate , appraisers say it 's OK merely to look at a photo , but for a more formal appraisal , industry experts agree that seeing the object is a must . <p> " There 's still a tremendous amount of doubt when appraising just through a photograph , " Hobart says . " You have to be able to assess the condition and quality of the item and that ca n't be done through a photo .
