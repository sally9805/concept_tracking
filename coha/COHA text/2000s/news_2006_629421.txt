Fourth Sunday of Advent ( B ) , Dec. 21 , 2008 Readings : 2 Sm 7:1-5 , 8b-12 , 14a , 16 ; Ps 89:2-5 , 27 , 29 ; Rom 16:25-27 ; Lk 1:26-38 " Nothing will be impossible for God " ( Lk 1:37 ) AS CHRISTMAS APPROACHES , the readings for the Fourth Sunday of Advent focus our attention on the notion of a dwelling place for God . In the first reading , King David finds himself free , in that he no longer has to fight his enemies . Instead , he can devote his energy to whatever he likes , so he plans to build a beautiful palace for himself and a from God that turns the plan upside down : " Should you build me a house to dwell in ? " God explains that all the success David has had is God 's doing , which now culminates in God 's establishing a house , that is , a dynasty , for David . There is a play on the word " house , " as it shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Davidic ruling line . Underlying the text is a criticism of the monarchy . In the verses omitted from the Lectionary selection ( w. 6-7a ) , God objects that YHWH has never asked any of the leaders of Israel to build a temple : " I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day , but I have been moving about in a tent and a tabernacle . " God has been on the move , dwelling with the Israelites in the same way they themselves have lived - in makeshift tents as they traversed the desert between Egypt and Canaan . And God has been present in a portable tabernacle that they carried with them wherever they sojourned . In the Gospel reading for the last Sunday of Advent , Gabriel 's message to Mary readings . The Gospel for Christmas day , the Prologue of John 's Gospel , reaches its high point with v. 14 , " and the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us . " The Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's predilection is to dwell with human beings in their ordinary dwellings and in their same human flesh . While there is a place for magnificent temples and churches where we can gather as a people to glorify God , the Holy One would have us first recognize that divinity walks around in our midst in human skin . Moreover , those who are least impressive by human standards are the most favored by God when it comes to revealing God 's mystery . David , for example , was the youngest , least qualified son , when God took him from pasturing sheep to lead his people . Mary was an ordinary young woman making wedding plans in an insignificant little town in Galilee , when she was asked to take on a seemingly impossible role . In both the first reading and the Gospel for the Fourth Sunday of Advent , there is a startling twist : it is not we who make dwelling places for God , but God who builds the house . Likewise , on of a human child , but also of how our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . We keep on becoming a child of God by receiving this lowly child , not only the one in the manger , but all those who seem insignificant all around us . The scene of the annunciation to Mary is a subject of much Christian art . Oftentimes Mary is portrayed as serenely praying and surrounded with light and joy . But in other annunciation scenes there is an undercurrent of distress , incomprehension and scandal in this story . Henry Ossawa Tanner captures this sense in his painting , " The Annunciation , " in which Mary sits at the edge of her disheveled bed , with a look of puzzlement and concern , while gazing toward a golden beam in the form of a cross . Megan Marlatt 's fresco " The Annunciation " in St. Michael 's Chapel at Rutgers University likewise depicts the topsy-turvy aspect of the event , as the angel appears upside down , uttering the word " Blessed " backwards . Mary 's life , as she thought it would be , is entirely upended , which is greatly troubling . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be . In addition , in her she and the man who is already her legal husband have not yet begun to live together . But all of them can count to nine . What will they say about her , what kinds of nasty looks will they cast her way when her precious child is born too soon ? While not spelling out how , Gabriel reassures Mary that in the midst of this messy situation , God will bring forth blessing , holiness and salvation for all . Twice God 's messenger assures her that she is grace-filled and is favored in God 's sight , even if others will question this . He also reassures her that she is not alone . Her relative , Elizabeth , will help mentor and support her . Without knowing how God will accomplish all this , Mary opens a space for God to dwell within her , enabling the divine to make a new home within all humankind . Mary makes a physical home for the Holy One in her womb ; hers was a unique role . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ourselves and within our world for the Christ . The circumstances are always messy . It is not in glorious buildings beautifully adorned but in the humblest of persons , in the most difficult of circumstances , or question why it is that God is punishing us , or why we have lost God 's favor . It is precisely in such times that God dwells most intimately with us , assuring us that we are full of grace and favor , asking us to trust that God can and will bring forth blessing , even if we can not see how . Many of our ancestors in the faith were called " flavored " by God : Noah ( Gn 6:8 ) , Moses ( Ex 33:12-17 ) , Gideon ( Jgs 6:17 ) and Samuel ( 1 Sm 2:26 ) . God always asks a great deal of " favored " ones . Moses , for example , found it so burdensome at one point that he prayed God would do him the " favor " of killing him at once , so he need no longer face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Mary is right to be troubled when Gabriel calls her " favored " one . But God 's " favor " is also accompanied by God 's power and protecting Spirit . Jesus , too , has " the favor of God " upon him ( Lk 2:40 , 52 ) , a favor that extends to all who receive him , as John 's Gospel says in the Christmas reading in the Gospel for Christmas Midnight Mass , the shepherds sing of the pteace now manifest for all those favored by God ( Lk 2:14 ) - that is , all who make room in their " inns " for this unlikely Coming One .
