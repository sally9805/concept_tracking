For people with really sensitive skin , sunscreen sometimes is n't enough . More manufacturers are offering clothing  --  some fashionable , some burqaesque  --  specially designed to protect skin from harmful ultraviolet ( UV ) rays . Solar Eclipse sells a " driving sleeve " for arms that hang out of car windows . Sun Precautions has a nose-to-neck ventilated mask ( above ) . And Coolibar offers a kid 's cap with a protective neck drape . <P> Do these duds do the job ? Unlike sunscreen , which falls under the FDA 's watch , sun-protective clothing is largely unregulated . Even so , the industry has its own voluntary standards . The weave in sun-protective clothing is extra tight , so ultraviolet rays ca n't penetrate . Some companies treat fabric with chemicals that reflect or absorb UV beams , in several cases using the same compounds that keep car seats from fading . That 's not to say ordinary clothing ca n't do the trick . Off-the-rack blue jeans , for example , provide an SPF of more than 1,000.  --  By Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
