It was seven-thirty in the morning when Ella Rose , clad in her pink satin bathrobe , walked across her Culver City apartment , turned on the pert voices of KNX Newsradio , and sat down at her kitchen table , ready to write her morning list . Ella 's wooden table was dwarfed by her bulky kitchen appliances . Her table was now always set , elegantly , for one : a single lace napkin , a straw placemat , her favorite crystal glass . Ella put her pad and pencil on the placemat ; she began her list with the date . On her refrigerator , her daily calendar was turned to the page : September 23 , 1978. lena anniversary was written very neatly in red ink . Ella did not remember when she 'd last changed the day on her calendar ; she was n't sure that today was , in fact , September 23 . She reached over to her black phone on the kitchen counter . Picking up the receiver , she looked into it and then hung up . She lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book fell open as though exhausted . Placing her finger on an ad , Ella took a deep breath and carefully dialed the number . " Santa Glen Hardware , " a girlish voice said , and yawned . Ella sat very still . In a quiet , polite voice , she asked , " What day is it ? " Silence . " Santa Glen Hardware , " the girl announced , a bit more forcefully . " September twenty-third ? " asked Ella , her voice sharpening . " Miss ? Is it September twenty-third ? " " Who - Brett , what day is it ! " the girl yelled . " Some - what ! Twenty-what ? Okay . Twenty-third . Hello ? It 's the twenty-third . Can I help - " " Thank you , " Ella said , and hung up . Ella wrote september 23 , 1978 across the top of the page . She could hear the sounds of morning lifting off Pico Boulevard : produce trucks roaring like huge bison and birds cawing , sad , repetitive , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . wish lena happy anniversary .

Mrs. Lowenstein , the director of Panorama Village for the past two years , had called several times this week , each time describing Lena 's latest misdemeanors with perhaps unnecessary detail . For twelve years , Lena and Bob had occupied Room 129 . Ella had moved them into the residence when Lena was thirty-six and Bob forty-four . She had watched the two of them wander in , the babies of the place , her daughter 's red hair shining like a poppy among the silver hairdos . Lena and Bob had always been on good behavior ; Ella believed they had many friends . Ella remembered why Lena was supposed to stop smoking and wrote this down : smoking is now limited to certain rooms at panorama village . Why did they have to limit it , anyway ?

With no further ideas , Ella amended number 15 to 15. check room . 16. von 's . Number 16 was a reminder for herself . Her hand was trembling slightly , and she put her pencil down . She stood up , opened the refrigerator , and peered inside . Ella had lived alone here for three years , since Lou 's death , and she was still not accustomed to a refrigerator that held only items that she liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans of V-8 , half a roast chicken , a carton of Mocha Mix , a pint of low-fat cottage cheese , most of a box of See 's candy - some of the pieces with one bite taken out of them - an ancient container of Parkay , a large bag of Oreos , and a plastic container of matzo ball soup . She kept a package of beef jerky , one of Lou 's favorite foods , in the butter compartment . It comforted her to leave the jerky there , and she harbored a secret hope that she might open the compartment to find that the package had disappeared . She had vowed not to eat it herself , but last night she had missed Lou terribly and had tried a few of the dry , salty strips while she watched television . When she went to bed , her mouth tasted like his . Ella picked up her pad and wrote on a second page : 17. jerky. 18. bananas . 19. baloney. 20. bread . What should number 21 be on her list ? She closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark . The content of number 21 was just another bit of information she had lost . And two weeks ago she had found in her closet a scallop-sleeved , eggplant-purple polyester dress that she was certain she had never seen before . The dress hung , limp and arrogant ; it seemed to have blown in , of its own volition , to join her other dresses in the middle of the night . Ella tried very hard to remember when she had purchased it . She took the dress from the closet and placed it on her bed , wondering where it had come from and wishing it would go away . 22. talk to vivien about lena . Her younger daughter 's name had floated on and off Ella 's lists for the last year or so . She often wrote it with the best of intentions but then crossed it out . This was what Mrs. Lowenstein had told her in their conversations over the last six months : Lena had left her room at midnight and tried to get on an RTD bus . Lena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pockets heavy with stolen cigarettes . Lena had demanded to use the office phone and had dialed a strange number ; she had ended up calling Singapore . The phone rang . Ella set down her pencil and picked up the phone on the fourth ring . " Hello ? " she asked . She was very still . " Yes , this is Lena 's mother . " Ella 's brown Buick floated in front of Vivien 's house . The broad ranch-style homes were similar , built on a tract ; her daughter 's lawn was the only one aglow with red roses , and to Ella it looked as though the flowers were being readied for some exciting event . She did n't know exactly why she had come to Vivien 's first , except that she needed company ; Mrs. Lowenstein claimed that Lena had set fire to her room at Panorama Village , and Ella did not know how to handle this . Her granddaughter Shelley was on the front lawn . Shelley was twelve years old and was sitting so quietly that Ella almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fierce expression . Ella parked the car and got out . Shelley stood up and rushed to her eagerly , as though she were running downhill . " Honey , where 's your mother ? " " Out . " " Your father ? " " Out . " " You 're all alone ? " This must have been the wrong question . The girl looked lost on the patch of lawn , as if she 'd just dropped there from the sky . She shrugged violently and nodded . Then she examined Ella . " Why are you all dressed up ? " Ella had spent a half-hour selecting the right dress for her conference with Mrs. Lowenstein . After much deliberation , she had settled on a deep green silk dress with shoulder pads , her most recent acquisition from Bullock 's . She had paired this with faux diamond earrings , which matched a star-shaped brooch . On her feet were her bone pumps in Italian leather . Lou had developed a theory that important people wore light-colored shoes , because this showed that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You buy shoes that show stains , " he told Ella , his eyes large and philosophical . " You can afford to get them cleaned . " " There was a fire at Panorama Village , " Ella said . She tried to say this in a calm voice . " The director said Lena set it . " Shelley 's face woke up . " A real fire ? " she asked . " How big ? " " It was in her room . " Ella tried to remember what else Mrs. Lowenstein had said . " Lena 's fine . " Mrs. Lowenstein had sounded saddened by that fact . " They only needed two fire extinguishers , and the fire affected only one corner of her room . The wall . Maybe the rug . There was some water damage to the floor . " Her voice surged on , trembling ; perhaps it would be better to stop . " Now . I just wanted to see if Vivien would like to come - " " I will . " " You 'll what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buick , pulled open the door , and slipped into the front seat . Ella remembered that there was a rule about Shelley 's going to Panorama Village , but she could n't remember what it was . Her granddaughter had visited Lena and Bob every Saturday for the past year or so . During her nightly calls , Lena had told Ella mysterious facts about these visits . " Shelley thought it would be fun to swim in a pool filled with lemonade , " Lena reported happily . Or , " She came at twelve-thirty and left at four-eighteen . She wore a blue leather cap . " Lena 's voice was breathless when she described the visits , and had a boastful edge . Ella did not know what to make of her twelve-year-old granddaughter 's choosing to spend so much time with her retarded aunt and uncle . Neither did Vivien . " You should see what she wears to visit them , " Vivien had told her in a wondering voice . Shelley never told anyone what she , Lena , and Bob did together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for Ella , told her that the three of them wandered around the same two blocks ; occasionally they visited Sav-on . Lena , Bob , and Shelley looked forward to the visits . " Have a nice time , Lena , " Ella would say . " Make sure you take good care of her . " Shelley had stopped visiting Lena after the accident several months ago . Ella walked over to the car ; Shelley was already belted in . " She 's waiting for us , " she said . " Let 's go . " Ella did not want to drive down to Panorama Village by herself . She got in and they rode through the hills , furred and golden with chaparral , to the San Fernando Valley . It was the beginning of the day . The light seemed brighter , older , as they passed into the valley ; the gauzy gray mist separated to reveal the sky burning hard and white overhead . When they arrived , Ella and Shelley sat on orange plastic seats in the lobby , their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entertaining versions of the same thought . The sun fell in pale , dusty strips on the gritty linoleum . They waited for Mrs. Lowenstein to bring Lena to them . Usually at nine on Saturday , there were few human sounds in the lobby ; most of the residents were still sealed in their dreams . But this morning they had been awakened , and most of them clustered , buzzing , in the hall . Ella observed the residents wandering through the lobby . One woman turned to her with a weird , frothy smile ; Ella realized she had toothpaste in her mouth that she 'd forgotten to spit out . One lady was sitting with her legs apart , in a nightshirt ; her hairless vagina resembled a large pecan . There was also a dapper-looking gentleman who sometimes emitted a deep bark . Ella was glad to have her granddaughter sitting beside her , but she deeply wished Lou were here . Not that he had come with her often when he was alive - Lou had mastered the art of leaving Lena 's problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became extraordinarily helpful . She closed her eyes and imagined him sitting beside her in his navy linen suit , his aftershave smelling sweet and aquatic . He would be brimming with schemes to bribe Mrs. Lowenstein . " Let 's give her a lifetime store discount , " he 'd murmur . " Any shoes she desires , fifty percent off . Or just cash . Three hundred , plus damages , no questions . " He would be so enamored of his plans , the fire would seem a bad joke , another crooked dream . Ella had also considered ways to prevent Mrs. Lowenstein from realizing that her daughter might be a budding arsonist . Right now , Ella had a strategic box of See 's candy on her lap . She kept a few boxes in her apartment for such emergencies . She looked at the box with longing , wondering whether she could steal a candy without Mrs. Lowenstein 's missing it . Shelley was tapping her hand against the chair , as though she were secretly playing music to accompany the residents ' slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she immediately stopped tapping and folded her hands firmly in her lap . " Let me ask you , " Ella whispered . " How do we know any of them did n't do it ? " She scrutinized the crowd aimlessly milling around . " That man . With shaky hands . Now would n't he drop a match , more than Lena would ? " Shelley looked at the man . " It could be him , " she offered . " They could be framing her . " " Lena 's too nice a person , " said Ella . " They know they can get away with it . " The two of them observed the residents , most of whom looked too worn out to plot a conspiracy . " They ca n't kick her out , " Ella said . " She needs her routine . She likes the red Jell-O . " She sat up straighter . " They 've all done bad things . It does n't matter if they 're a hundred . Some of them get away with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think she 'll like nougat ? " " Who ? " " Mrs. Lowenstein . She likes candy . " Ella noticed Shelley 's puzzled expression and quickly covered the candy box with her purse . " People like to be appreciated , " she said . " They regard you in a more respectful way . " She adjusted her shoulder pads , hoping she looked a little like a general . She wished she had asked Shelley to change her outfit before coming here . The girl 's arms were skinny as a child 's in her tank top , and her denim shorts were frayed . But she did not seem concerned about her appearance . She gripped the bottom of her chair as though trying to keep herself from shooting through this place ; Shelley also seemed grimly attached to the chair , as though afraid of what , let loose , she might find . " You know , " said Ella , " appearance is the first thing people see about you . Then they get to know the real you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint off her tank top . Ella removed a small brush from her purse . " Fine for sitting on the lawn , " she said , " but not for a fire . " Gently , Ella began to brush Shelley 's hair . The girl arched up , like a cat , into the brush strokes . The aides , glistening in their white nylon uniforms , were clearing the residents . They did this tenderly , like angels separating clouds . Shelley and Ella sat and waited for someone to claim them . Mrs. Lowenstein was coming toward them with Lena . They were walking arm in arm , like a celebrity with her escort , down the fuzzy , fluorescent hall . Shelley jumped up . Ella had hoped that Shelley would walk beside her , in a dignified fashion , but the girl shot ahead . Ella fumbled with her dress and then rose and followed Shelley , her heels clicking on the linoleum . And here was her daughter , coming toward her with such breathless force that she broke free of Mrs. Lowenstein ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was wearing a new peach-colored cotton housecoat , covered with daisies , that came from Lane Bryant . Ella could see the price tag poking out of a sleeve . Her cherry-red sneakers did n't quite match the housecoat . Her fine short hair , glinting with rusty gold , looked pretty in the light . She was running her fingers down her hair , a gesture Ella recognized as an attempt to brush it . Mrs. Lowenstein stepped into a doorway and began talking in Spanish to an aide . When Ella reached Shelley and Lena , she saw how happy they looked ; they were touching fingertips and talking excitedly . " I made a fire ! " Lena exclaimed . " It smelled bad . " Her arms were powdery with ash . " Shhh ! " said Ella , glancing at Mrs. Lowenstein . " Do n't say that . " Lena 's palms were grimy , and she was making a mess out of Shelley , too . Ella dug a Kleenex out of her purse and began to wipe Lena 's palms ; getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lena reeked of fire and Thrifty 's Intimate perfume . " It was an accident , " whispered Ella , hoping . " It was an accident , and thank God you 're all right . " She carefully wiped her daughter 's fingers . They did not appear to grow old with the rest of her ; they were chubby and pink and seemed to promise a great future . " Now , what happened ? Tell me - " With her free hand , Lena brought one of Shelley 's palms to her face and kissed it noisily . " You do n't come to see me anymore . " " I wanted to , " Shelley began . " But they - " " You 're here , " Lena said . She patted Shelley 's hair as though it were a towel she was using to dry wet hands . " Today is a special day . " " Fine , " said Ella . " Now what - " " You ca n't say it 's not ! " Lena shrieked . " All right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purse . " Honey , you ca n't go around saying you set a fire . It 's not going to make you lots of friends - " Shelley stepped up to her grandmother with the demeanor of an irate lawyer . " I would like to take my aunt out for coffee , " she announced . " Coffee ? " asked Ella . " Twelve-year-olds do n't drink coffee . " Shelley tried to stand taller , as though that would help . " Doughnuts , " she amended . " Just down the block . " It was a ridiculous request , but Lena and Shelley were urgent in their desire to be taken seriously . Ella noticed Mrs. Lowenstein turn toward her . " All right , " she said quickly , " Go . Whatever . But come right back . " They ran down the hallway , urgent as two salesmen on an important mission . They went around a corner and were gone . Mrs. Lowenstein , a heavy woman in her forties , seemed to have been born in a boxy navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in Panorama Village . Every time Ella saw Mrs. Lowenstein , she wondered whether the woman had some secret job - perhaps selling insurance . This thought helped Ella maintain a healthy skepticism toward anything the director said about Lena , especially anything she did n't want to hear . " Mrs. Lowenstein , " said Ella , standing up and holding out the candy box , " I 've brought you a present . I was surprised to hear what you said this morning and - " " Ella , you did n't need to do that , " Mrs. Lowenstein said , somewhat sharply . Ella continued to offer the box . " I know you like nougat . I asked them to put extra in . " " Okay , okay , " said Mrs. Lowenstein . " Thank you . " She took the box and led Ella into a small room , where she seated herself on a couch and indicated that Ella do the same . " Now , " said Mrs. Lowenstein , " we need to talk . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just called Vivien . Let 's wait to discuss everything when she arrives . " Ella was startled . " Vivien ? I 'm sure she has plenty of other things to do . " She tried to laugh . " I would be happy to talk about it now . " Ella knew exactly how to fix Lena 's life ; it was what she had done for forty-eight years . Vivien was busy with her husband , her children , her work . She would be included in the discussion about Lena when Ella found it necessary . Mrs. Lowenstein , apparently , had broken that unspoken rule . Mrs. Lowenstein glanced at her fingernails , which were polished a clear flesh color . It seemed to Ella that if Mrs. Lowenstein wanted to polish her fingernails that plain color , she should not polish them at all . " Why do n't we wait ? " said Mrs. Lowenstein . " Why do n't you take a look at Lena 's room ? " She got up and walked quickly into the lobby . Ella remained on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Mrs. Lowenstein want to speak to her alone ? Ella wanted to make clear that Vivien was to be called only at her request . The sun flushed fiery against the windows . Outside , in the garden , the pink gardenias and birds of paradise looked brutally healthy , reaching up into the morning light . Ella watched as the director placed her hand on a resident 's shoulder . It was a gesture of sickening delicacy . Clearly , Mrs. Lowenstein had a grudge against Lena or against the retarded ; perhaps she had had bad experiences with fire . Ella wanted to rush up and accuse her of prejudice . Instead , she headed down the long hall to Lena 's room . The hallway was so familiar to her she felt as though she were not walking down it of her own accord but was being carried down its length . The doors on either side were marked with large gold numbers . Some of the doors were ajar , and Ella saw rooms filled with shadows . Each one had a TV turned up high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ella caught glimpses of faded flower arrangements , stuffed animals with wide grins , a bouquet of metallic red balloons lilting in the air conditioner 's low whir . The rooms were festive in a shabby , hopeful way . Ella paused before Room 129 , where Lena and Bob had lived . She had been here hundreds of times over the past twelve years , bringing Kleenex , Q-tips , Chap Sticks , Hershey bars , new bedspreads , posters , plastic bowls , aftershave , toilet paper , various brands of shampoo . She 'd brought combs , plastic sunglasses , toothpaste , toothbrushes , Nivea , Tic Tacs , Sucrets , Band-Aids , suntan lotion , and sunburn cream . For twelve years , Ella had walked down the hallway carrying her white plastic bags from Thrifty 's and Sav-on . Each time she approached this door , she could feel herself become a useful person . Each time , she could feel them waiting for her .                    @
