PLEAD WITH YOU , RETURN them to me - please return them . Or let me in , let me join them . I will not resist . I will come to you in silence to recover them . It will be my own decision , even if it is the only one you leave me . They would have been seven years old now . They were only five at the time . Have you allowed them to grow ? Would I recognize them if they were returned to me this evening ? Of course ! Even changed , even spoiled by the passage of time , I would recognize them . Only Benjamin would hide his face , deny the loss - he thinks they are gone for good . Two years in which he gave up hope of ever seeing them again . Resigning yourself to the worst is much easier than my way , than going on with the struggle . Hope saps the will more surely than a lapse of memory . He has wasted two years playing at being deaf and blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to explain to Benjamin , but he did not want to know anything . It 's always the same for him - they were taken away , whoever has them will not return them even if they are still alive . " They 're dead , Deborah . Get used to the idea . You 'll never see them again . " Why is it always men who go to pieces ? It is not Benjamin who night after night comes to this hill to plead for your leniency . He does nothing but wait , drunk more often than he is sober - counting the seconds , the hours , the years which have passed since that day . That day , that morning , just after we had woken up , he yelled my name from the doorway to the twins " room . I rushed in , to find it empty . The beds were unmade , the covers were thrown into heaps . The wind was roaring in through the open window . And there was no trace of the children . Flown away , Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like that , in one moment , that single second it had taken me to cross to their door . All was lost . There was no going back after that , now that the door had opened on to emptiness . I wanted to think I had n't seen what happened , so that I could pretend they were still there , on the other side , playing under the covers like two noisy imps . But that morning , for the first time in their five years , they were not waiting for us . Benjamin opened the door and regarded the empty bedroom . By then it was too late to close his eyes again . He had been drained in a single heartbeat , as suddenly as a bathtub is emptied when the plug is snatched away . He was still gripping the handle of the door when I rushed up behind him and saw with my own eyes . He uttered my first name , but after that he said no more . Something had died behind his eyes , deep down . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He abandoned everything with a single shrug of his shoulders . His twins , his wife , his family . It 's so easy to become a human wreck . When sorrow stands as an alibi , anything is possible . What good is it to hope , Deborah ? They have gone . Benjamin closed the window and locked the twins " door . He was never to reopen it . Closed with a double turn of the lock , creating a sanctum . Spent the first days searching , interrogating neighbors , scouring the fields , more with hope than belief . Finally he settled , comfortably , into quiet despair and wallowed in his loneliness . Now he could let it take over : other people 's looks allowed him to . Perhaps the seed had already been in him for a long time . But he had been under self-control for six years . Not a drop of alcohol in front of Adam and Anna , not that , never . Benjamin adored his twins . Now for him there was nothing better to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing about him changed , at first appearance . He was like a smooth and succulent fruit , but already rotting inside . There surely were some who joined him in the bar , ready to sow more discontent with their well-meaning looks and annoyed expressions . You ought to know , Benjamin , we have seen your wife acting weirdly out there at the top of the hill . You should keep your eye on her . And Benjamin gestured to them to get lost and leave him alone . I tried to explain to him , though . How could he not see the signs ? Pajamas rolled up in a ball , left on the hill , Anna 's teddy bear which lay in the middle of the lawn ? The window opened from inside* . What kind of prowler could have broken into the house without causing damage ? They opened the window themselves . They knew what they were doing . It is like those vampire stories where the monster may only enter when it has been invited . They opened the window and they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them . They came naked as they were on their first day of Uf e . Laughing , surely ? Scarcely five years of life , ten years of experience between them , and they could already hear your voice . Me , I never knew to learn . I never wished it either . Until the day when you took them . I showed Benjamin the marks and the clues . I even brought him to you so that he could see what I can see , but he averted his eyes with an expression of weariness beyond irritation . As if it was I who had become the wreck , the drunkard . As if I had pointed to mirages born of a sick brain . Two years that he has been closed like an oyster , hermetic , because if he opened up , even for a moment , all the whys and hows would flood in , and he would have to acknowledge there is no answer . So , I was the one who came to you when at last I understood . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight you , I learned how to know you . Over those two years , I have spent more nights with you on this hill than in the marital bed . That is where Benjamin turned his back on me , while breathing the restless sleep of cowards . I came to plead with you , to beg you , to threaten you , and you stayed there with me to scoff . You kept them where I could see them , but they were always beyond my reach . I waited , and I learned . You let me explore , one evening after another , while my gestures became more assured . I returned home reeking of your smell . Benjamin slept . He thought I was mad . If only he had listened to me , just the once . If he had taken in what I told him he would have come to you with an axe , and used it mercilessly . Afterward he would have consigned you to fire , until the memory of the twins flew up in the smoke . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certainty on his forgetting . The first few times when I scratched your shell I skinned the palms of my hands . The bark is rough against hands that have not been coarsened . My fists are bruised where they attacked your hard bark . I soiled you with traces of my blood , like a derisory , ridiculous offering . I struck , spat and scratched , a demented woman . This wound in the bark , a trace in the tissue like a scar , it was I who tore off this splinter with my fingernails , one night when silence wounded my ears . That silence asphyxiating me like a fetid smell , on top of the hill , you rearing up in front of me , roots anchored well in the ground . I would have sworn it was you who silenced the noise , who stole the air I was trying to breathe . The twins , were n't they enough for you ? I risked glancing down to the bottom of the hill , where the houses were quiet , as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your branches stretching out to scratch the stars . I felt the weight of the world crushing me . Then I concentrated on the shade of the twins that was in you . There were nights when I was so desperate I would have torn off the skin on my fingers to strip you of your bark , one flake at a time , leaving you naked , to get to my twins beneath the surface . Then you would have had to return them to me . I would have separated the Siamese creature with my fingernails , to make them into two again , Anna and Adam . I would have attacked you with bare hands , if I had thought it would have done any good . Instead , I learned . I discovered the intoxicating perfume of your bark after the rain . The feeling of wood beneath my fingers , solid and reassuring , all this power in my arms . The complexity of the mosaic on which my palms slipped , like the scales of an old and fantastic animal . I learned how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one discovers the skin of a new lover . Benjamin laughed the first time we made love , eight years ago , close to this place . He was a nineteen-year-old urchin who could not believe in his luck . We were married on this hill . After the ceremony he chased me through the brambles which tore at my marriage veils , as foolish as a schoolboy running after girls " skins . He planted two seeds in me while we lay between the trees , away from the gaze of others . I brushed past you in my torn skirts . Did you know then what was coming ? The bark is not so hard to the touch when one grows used to it . I know through my fingertips the relief map of your grooves , your canyons , the edges where I wounded my hands . I learned the pattern of your wrinkles and your veins , your fault lines and your crevices , the map of your scars . I inspected you as if you were a door without a visible lock , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you were an ancient parchment that had to be deciphered . I 'm sure it amused you to watch me ? To see me while holding my little ones out of reach ? I do n't know how Benjamin failed to see the two masks set in the bark . Two faces drawn in the higher pan of the trunk , just below the nodes of your main branches , as if carved from the same wood . They can be seen , though . The features are coarse : just eyes , nose , mouth . Neither lips , nor hair , nor eyebrows . But they seem a natural pan of the whole , as if they have always been there . Two oval growths on the trunk , back to back . Admit that you did it on purpose ! Two years that they turn their backs on each other , like the two faces of Janus . You did this deliberately , to separate them . It is all pan of the irony of the thing : they are together , but they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see them both at the same time . I have to choose between Adam or Anna . You placed them out of reach , just too far away for me to skim my fingertips across them . I did try , though . But you are huge , on a human scale . The trunk is so large I can not encircle it with my two arms . You erased even their differences . The two faces are identical , like two African masks without distinguishing features . They were still at the age where people could confuse them . They often wondered which of the twins was the small girl , which the boy . The same round face , the same black hair cut short , the same eyebrows already clearly featured , inherited from Benjamin . Anna had a small dimple in her left cheek when she laughed . Of the two of them , she was already the wild one . She would have made my life difficult if she had grown up . Such a mischievous smile signals great crises ahead . Adam was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need boundless patience to unravel the damage of his twin tornado . I searched for them in the faces of the other children as they walked out of school . All the five-year-old kids of the neighborhood . I watched them passing , as I stood with the group of other mothers . I was rooted to the spot . All these good , home-loving women who would never come on the hill for their little ones . But it is true that I spent many days there , to keep an eye on the school . I hated them , those animated faces so full of life . All those little faces too adorable to be fair . They nauseated me . I sought and found two of them . A little boy , a small girl , both five years old . Almost alike enough to be twins . Perhaps they were cousins . Same black hair , same grasshopper limbs , like Adam , like Anna . One evening I arrived before their mothers . I carried them in my arms to you , offering a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every kid in the village to you if you had asked . I would have knifed them with a light heart for the return of my own twins . But carved in wood , the two faces were always waiting . Did they see me burying their soft toys and their clothing between your roots ? From the first I believed that the face on the left was Anna 's . It seemed to me I could see one of the masks smiling , if a smile could be detected under the bark . But I was deluding myself . They are identical , except for small details . And I can not even see them side by side to compare them . To look closely at one of them , it is necessary to turn away from the other . Do they look at me , from their perch ? And if they do see me , can they at least remember me ? Perhaps their memory has become stilled , now that you and they have become one . I always believed that a child can not forget his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to face with your fears . Two children with the memory of a tree . Lost in their wooden sleep , their chlorophyll dreams . Certain evenings , I wound myself around your limbs so that I could press my ear against your skin . I thought I could hear something fluttering beneath your bark , almost within reach . It reminded me of my former life , when Benjamin 's quiet breathing sometimes kept me awake in our bed . I thought I heard twin hearts beating slowly against my ear . But I was just deluding myself again . Have you at least let them grow ? They are always five years old in my head - as they will be , undoubtedly , in their chrysalis . They would be cramped if they were growing physically . They would need to learn how to spread through your membranes to leave them changed . If you were to return them to me this evening , would I recognize them ? Two years of sleep nourished by your sap , that must leave a trace . They would inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less human . But you would return them to me ! I would take them again just as they are , I promise you . Benjamin would not understand , but I would take them again , no matter what form they might be in . And whether or not they recognize me . Was all this to punish me ? My mother used to talk to the trees , in her time . She spent nights on this hill , although I never knew why . I was also born to listen to the voices of the trees , but I chose to be deaf to them . You undoubtedly did what you did as a way of recalling me to you , because until then I had refused to listen . But I learn quickly , you see . I listen and I learn . I am on your side now . Let me hear your voice , the one that made my twins run to this hill . They had the gift , too . They came here laughing . Toward their wooden cage . Toward their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to ask you to take me . Let me become you . I come in peace , drunk with your perfume , to feel the reassuring touch of wood beneath my palms . I want to blend myself into you , let the bark absorb me . Later , perhaps , you will reject me again . I will be made surrogate mother for you if that is what you wish . Since they will reappear one day . You know how empty a woman feels , when she is a mother without her babies ? Benjamin fills his own void his way , by drowning the gaping hole they have left with too much whisky and beer . Me , I want only to take them into me again . Or then the three of us to melt into you . Let me join you . Ravage me if you must , nourish me with your sap . It is with pleasure that I will be made tree - what do I have to lose here ? I do n't fear for myself anymore , you see . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add mine to the fresco . Perhaps one day Benjamin will suddenly pass here and will think he recognizes me in one of the masks . But he will push away the idea , think it the delusion of a drunkard , and he will go home again to sleep it off in the empty bed . Poor fool . How he adored his twins ! I want to know what you did to them . It matters little to me that they became wood , foliage , chlorophyll . I want to know and to become like them , even if it is necessary to take a share of you . Accept me into you , put me near them , shelter me from the world . Do n't make me wait any longer .
