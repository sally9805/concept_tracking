Music , as any teen in a garage band will tell you , should be as simple to make as it is to listen to . That has n't always been the case with musicmaking software though . Turning your computer into a recording studio with programs like Pro Tools and Cakewalk Plasma means splashing out hundreds of dollars and slogging through dense instruction manuals . There had to be an easier way . Now Apple has found it with GarageBand , part of its $49 suite of Mac-only iLife applications released last week . As the name suggests , GarageBand is aimed at amateurs . You do n't need to read the manual to put together a pretty professional-sounding tune . You do n't even need much talent . <P> At its simplest level , GarageBand lets you lay down loopsprerecorded short riffs by drums , bass , piano and so on . There are 1,000 loops to choose from on the basic software and 2,000 more on the $99 add-on , Jam Pack . Here 's the clever bit : the loops are arranged not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Intense , " " Cheerful " and so on . Click and drag your loops into the score , and they become interactive . You can stretch and splice them like lumps of Play-Doh . In just 10 minutes I found I could intuitively assemble a thumping dance ditty that would not disgrace most deejays ' decks . <P> You can add your own musical stylings by plugging in a keyboard , microphone or guitar . Apple is selling a $99 keyboard that plugs directly into the computer via a USB connection , and a $149 amp for guitar , bass , microphone and keyboards with MIDI connections . There are 50 software instruments in GarageBand and an additional 100 in Jam Pack . You can make your guitar seem as if it 's coming through a vintage ' 60s amp , or your keyboard sound like a surprisingly realistic steel guitar . Select a sound and you 're ready to hit the Record button . And if you flub the recording , even with the built-in metronome ? Not to worry . Hit the Fix Timing button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Ben Folds . Just do n't let your piano teacher catch you doing it . <P> Like any other brand-new software , GarageBand has its bugs . For one thing , you 're supposed to be able to use digital music files from iTunes , theoretically making sampling a snap , but most of mine kept getting rejected . And GarageBand hogs a lot of computer memory . Still , these are quibbles compared with how easy it is to create a song with up to 64 layers of loops and tracks . Coolest of all : you can save that work of genius to your iPod . After all , your music should be as simple to listen to as it was to make .
