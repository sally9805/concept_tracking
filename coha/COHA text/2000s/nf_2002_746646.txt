This is a comparison and analysis of the tenure and promotion process at two institutions . It begins with a look at the dominant questions about tenure in literature and continues by reviewing and analyzing suggestions offered to those preparing for the process from various disciplines in higher education . The experience of seeking tenure and promotion at two institutions is reviewed with important differences in procedure explained . One committee gave detailed feedback during annual review that allowed for reflection and subsequent action to meet the expectations of the tenure and promotion committee . Additionally , that committee was guided by Scholarship Assessed , unlike the committee from the other institution that was guided only by convention and the collective wisdom of committee members . Some suggestions were offered to those preparing for the tenure process . <p> There are two questions dominating the literature on tenure : ( a ) What is it ? , and ( b ) What shall we do with it at the institutional level ? ( Hutcheson , 1998 ) . Tierney &; Bensimon ( 1996 ) interviewed over 300 tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of tenure and promotion in higher education ; answering Hutcheson 's first question . <p> Facing Change : Building the Faculty of the Future ( 1999 ) is a report from a group sponsored by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities ( AASCU ) . The AASCU organized selected Washington , D.C.- based higher education associations and public education systems to undertake an exhaustive review of institutional policies that affect faculty . It was called the Faculty Review Project and defined tenure as an effort to provide security if and when a professor wished to practice academic freedom that may or may not be controversial . It noted that somewhere along the way tenure became equivalent with job security and a guarantee of continued employment . The group made fifty recommendations ; among them were recapturing the obligations of tenure , adding more accountability to sabbaticals and incorporating part-time faculty members into the fabric of campus life . Charles Reed , Chair of the Faculty Review Project , offered that the report was the beginning of the answer to , " so what should we do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ; What should we do with it ? <p> The concept of tenure is an integral part of the employment relationship between institutions of higher education and individual faculty members ( Mawdsley , 1999 ) . Promotion and tenure decisions are often difficult and always have important long-term consequences for both the candidate and the institution ( Rhoades-Catanach &; Stout , 2000 ) . As a colleague once observed , " tenure establishes a marriage between a faculty member and the university where divorce is not an option ! " <p> To underscore the importance of tenure decisions several researchers have compiled guidance for those preparing for tenure review . Diamond ( 1995 ) considers preparing for tenure as one of the most difficult and challenging experiences a person can have . His preparation guide crosses disciplines and offers specific strategies for document preparation . Other writers address more specific disciplines . Westney ( 2000 ) addresses tenure in relation to teaching and technology . Doost ( 2000 ) addresses tenure and accountancy while Amy &; Crow ( 2000 ) offer strategies regarding recognition of computers and composition in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers eleven suggestions for Ph.D . students and assistant professors for managing their tenure process . They are : make a substantive research contribution to accountancy ; do research you love ; acknowledge , accept , and manage the nausea that accompanies writing ; do a lot of whatever works ; learn the craft of publishing in academe ; learn which aspects of teaching matter and to whom ; work with and benefit from one 's colleagues ; work and hope you are lucky ; manage " paradigmatic clash " ; reduce stress by cultivating " free attention " ; and learn to skillfully adapt to circumstances rather than carefully plan . <p> Doost ( 2000 ) argues against items 3 , 4 and 8 . He feels that Professor Stone is wrong in comparing writing as a new faculty member and that of tedious , difficulty job of dissertation writing ; referring to suggestion 3 and the notion that writing must be accompanied by nausea . Doost ( 2000 ) takes issue with suggestion 4 by arguing that we should conduct research that matters and not just " whatever works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also take issue with suggestion 8 , " work hard and hope you are lucky . " Doost ( 2000 ) offers alternatives from his experiences in seeking tenure . He offers Socrates famous argument , " An unexamined life is not worth living , " to suggest asking what have we really contributed in our lifetime , not " working harder and harder . " I propose that leaving things to " luck or a deity " is like the story that Crum ( 1997 ) tells about a man caught in a flood on the roof of his home . When a man in a rowboat came offering help , he declined saying God would take care of him . Later , when the man was waist deep in water , he denied a motorboat attempt saying God would save him . Still later , up to his neck in water , a helicopter flew over for one last attempt , the man still insisted that God would save him . After he drowned , the man asked St. Peter why God had not helped him . St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? He sent you two boats and a helicopter . " <p> I propose three additional suggestions to those preparing for tenure review . They are : keep all of your materials updated , all of the time ; get feedback from your promotion and tenure committee formally or informally ; and consider collegiality a major factor in tenure and promotion decisions ( Mawdsley , 1999 ) . <p> Mawdsley ( 1999 ) argues that collegiality is a factor in tenure decisions and gives twenty-four good reasons ; that is how many legal tenure cases he cited in his research on collegiality ! <p> My suggestions are based on personal experience . This is the second time that I have applied for and been granted tenure and promotion . The process was not identical at both institutions . Some important differences in the processes were that the committee at the second institution provided detailed guidance for improvement ; Scholarship Assessed guided that committee ; and that committee included external peer review of my tenure documents . The written feedback enabled me to have a progress report in all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that " God would save me . " The feedback guided preparation efforts and enabled me to meet the committee 's exact expectations . Lane Cooper , in his introduction to The Rhetoric of Aristotle , p. xxiii , says , " People in actual life make their choices first , and then argue in accordance with those choices . Few argue a matter out so as then to make their choices from reasonable inference . " Some committees use tenure and promotion documents simply to strengthen their argument for or against candidates ; their minds are made up very early in the review , long before the vote is even considered . The detailed guidance that I received offered encouragement and suggestions for developing the tripartite goal of teaching , research and service . The committee could see that I was attempting to reach their expectations and not rely on " hard work and luck . " <p> The tenure and promotion committee used Scholarship Assessed to answer the question ; in judging a faculty member 's performance , what are the criteria to be used ? The feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good scholarship ( Glassick , Huber &; Maeroff , 1997 ) : Clear goals Adequate preparation Appropriate methods Significant results Effective presentation Reflective critique <p> The six yardsticks of excellence apply to all forms of scholarship ( Boyer , 1996 ) . <p> Boyer ( 1996 ) envisioned a grid in which the scholarship of discovery , integration , application and presentation were placed horizontally across he top of a page , while running vertically down the side were the six standards by which the full scope of scholarship are measured . The promotion and tenure committee was guided by this vision of scholarship . <p> The external peer review allowed comments on my scholarly productivity by five peers in the field of educational administration to be added to my promotion and tenure document . The reviewers received a letter of instruction guiding their review predicated on the forms of scholarship developed by Boyer ( 1996 ) . The use of the peer review panel insured that outside referees familiar with my area of concentration reviewed my tenure document . The external review panel to conduct the review was composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department chair 's approval . Written feedback was received from the five-peer panel providing detailed assessment of my publications , service and teaching evaluations . Conclusion <p> Tenure serves as a lifetime assurance that we will receive due process in higher education . It does not assure us lifetime employment . The current AAUP contract at my institution states that faculty may be cut to respond to drastic enrollment declines or financial exigency . Peers will review a professor in order to recommend dismissal or retention as part of the review for promotion and tenure . <p> This comparison studied two institutional processes for awarding tenure and promotion . One gave detailed feedback during annual review that allowed for reflection and subsequent action to meet the expectations of the tenure and promotion committee . Additionally , that committee was guided by Scholarship Assessed , unlike the other committee that was guided only by convention and the collective wisdom of committee members . Lastly , outside peer review was conducted to gain detailed assessment of the tenure document by an outside referee .
