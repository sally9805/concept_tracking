<p> The tintinnabulations of the Abbey Church tower bells mixed with voices as the only sounds heard on the football practice field . It was on a recent gray late afternoon , and the St. John 's College team was running plays in this relatively isolated area in the central part of the state , located amid a forest with the trees nearly bare of leaves . <p> There were no whistles . <p> " I do n't like to have someone raise his voice to me , and I believe it 's the same for the players , " the head coach has said . " A whistle is like raising your voice . The players can get my drift with normal tones . " <p> For a long time in football , it was considered a resolution of toughness for coaches to withhold water from players , even on very hot days . But water was readily available here , and the coach said he has never withheld it from his players . <p> " I grew up in a coal-mining region in Colorado , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the mines , " the coach said . " They were given water and it surely did n't hurt them . When the miners came out , they got water . It only helped . So I figured , how could n't it be good for my football players , too ? " <p> And there is no tackling in practice . Never has been . " Why risk injury in practice and not have the player ready for the game ? " the coach said . " Most teams protect the quarterback in practice . We protect all the players . We assume they 'll get to do enough tackling in the game . " <p> And here the gentle coach shows another side . " And if we do n't , " one of his players said , " well , John tells us he 'll just have to get someone in our place who does . " <p> That 's another thing . The coach insists on being called by his first name . Not the traditional " Coach . " " They know I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find it necessary to keep reminding them . " <p> When considering Vince Lombardi or Bill Parcells or even Amos Alonzo Stagg , this unconventional approach would seem to be effective maybe for a sandlot team in touch football , but for a college football team , even a Division III team , like St. John 's ? <p> But , at this school run by Benedictine monks , it works , at least for John Gagliardi . And " winning with No , " as he calls it  --  there are about 100 such " no 's , "  --  works so well that Gagliardi , at 77 , stands to have the most coaching victories in the history of college football . <p> On Saturday , at home in Clemens Stadium , the red-and-white-clad Johnnies ( 8-0 ) , take on Bethel , another unbeaten team in their Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference . If St. John 's wins , it will be the 409th college victory for Gagliardi , in his 55th season as a head football coach . It would move Gagliardi one victory past the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gagliardi ( 408-114-11 ) is 68 victories ahead of Florida State 's Bobby Bowden and 70 ahead of Penn State 's Joe Paterno , both of whom follow him in the victories column . Gagliardi has also won three N.C.A.A. Division III championships and has a record of 20-9 in N.C.A.A. playoff games . ( Robinson 's record was 408-165-15 . ) <p> " Bethel is tough , " he said . " They make me nervous . " <p> Gagliardi ( pronounced guh-LAHR-dee ) never underestimates an opponent , which is part of the secret of success . And sometimes he is right to be concerned . Before last Saturday 's game , on the road against St. Thomas , he said he was terrified that the game might be played in the mud  --  rain was forecast  --  and that St. Thomas , a longtime rival , would be up for the game . This despite St. Thomas 's being 3-5 , riddled with injuries and a young squad , as opposed to the St. John 's team , which has three all-American players : wide receiver Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seniors . <p> It turned out that Gagliardi had reason for alarm . The Johnnies , before an overflow crowd of some 7,300 fans , fell behind in the second half for the first time this season , and they were losing , 12-7 , with eight minutes to go in the game . It had n't rained , but it was cold , and on the sideline Gagliardi pulled his maroon parka hood over the red baseball cap that covered the sparse gray hair on his head . He stood in ankle-high winter boots with his hands behind his back , watching a play through his wire-rim spectacles , seeming as calm as someone waiting for a light to change at a street corner . <p> When the play would end he would take a short stroll , sometimes dipping into his pocket to check the 15 or so note cards that he keeps his plays on  --  his team has no playbooks  --  and perhaps say something to one of his assistants . And then Gagliardi would stop to watch the next play , hands again folded behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stoic out there , " said Pat Reusse , a reporter for The Minneapolis Star Tribune who covers the team regularly , " but no one takes losing harder than John . He 's churning up inside . " <p> In fact , when Gagliardi was asked recently how long he thought he would stay as a coach , he replied : " As long as my health holds out , or if we start losing . And if we start losing , my health will surely not hold out . " <p> Well , the Johnnies cut their deficit to 12-9 with a safety , and then Brandon Keller , a 5-foot-7 junior place-kicker , booted a 20-yard field goal to tie the score with 3 minutes 16 seconds left . After another march downfield , Keller kicked a 35-yard field-goal with 8 seconds remaining to give Gagliardi his 408th career victory , 15-12  --  on his 77th birthday , no less . <p> The large St. John 's contingent in the stands warbled " Happy Birthday " to him ; he allowed himself a smile after the winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the kicker and a little wave of appreciation to the fans . " I do n't go in for celebrations , " he said afterward . " I 'm too old for celebrations . " <p> Although it is not often apparent , he does derive great satisfaction from his achievements , like winning another football game . And he enjoys the attention , such as the profile on him that College Sports Television is airing throughout this month . <p> " I 've never thought about goals , or how many games my teams can win , " he said . " Really , it 's the old cliche  --  I play them one game at a time . " <p> Elliott , the wide receiver , said the players " wanted to get it done for John . " <p> " We moved it up another level in the fourth quarter , " Elliott said at a news conference after the game . <p> Elliott also praised Gagliardi 's ability to adapt to different generations and to find a variety of ways to achieve victories , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on to today . " <p> Gagliardi interjected : " I 'm not stupid . When I have a receiver like him I 'm going to throw the ball . " <p> Keller , the place-kicker , said he simply did what he was taught to do , that those kicks were what he practiced every day , with positive rather than negative reinforcement . <p> " John expects us to get the job done , " he said . " Like he says , ' Just do it . ' " <p> The players hear regularly the coach 's mantra : " It 's ordinary people doing ordinary things in an extraordinary way . " <p> And if Keller did n't " just do it " ? <p> " What he probably does n't know , " said Gagliardi , seated beside Keller at a table in the St. Thomas gymnasium , " is that we would have strung him up back at the bell towers on campus if he would have missed . " <p> It is Gagliardi 's sense of humor as well as his perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is behind much of his success . He began coaching when he was 16 . As a junior in high school in 1943 , he was quarterback and captain of the Trinidad ( Colo . ) Catholic team when all the coaches were called up for service in World War II . <p> " The school officials asked me to coach the team , or they were considering eliminating football , " Gagliardi said . " So I took on the job . And I treated the players the way I wanted to be treated  --  since I was a player , too . " <p> The team won the championship . Rather than work in his father 's body shop  --  as several of his brothers did  --  Gagliardi went to a junior college and then was hired by Carroll College in Helena , Mont. , to coach football . His teams won ( 24-6-1 ) . In 1953 , at age 26 , he was offered the job at St. John 's and accepted . <p> He has had offers to move on , including one with the Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished has been without scholarships ( there are none in Division III ) , with recruiting primarily in-state , and no recruiting beyond phone calls and visits to the campus . <p> " I came here because of John , " said Damien Dumonceaux , who is a sophomore defensive lineman and one of 18 St. John 's players whose fathers had played for Gagliardi . " Because he wins and he makes football fun , the way it 's supposed to be . " <p> The Rev. Timothy Backous , the monk who is athletic director at St. John 's , said : " John is simply a football genius . He knows how to make a difficult situation come out right . " <p> No greater example was when he was courting Peg Daugherty , a student nurse at St. John 's nearly 50 years ago . She was 20 ; he was 28 . Gagliardi 's mother , who came from the Calabria region of Italy , was , he said , " a great cook , especially of spaghetti . " Daugherty was not Italian , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spaghetti dinner for him at her apartment . <p> " I used tomato soup for the sauce , " she said . " I did n't know any better . " <p> Gagliardi had a dilemma . " Should I tell her the truth , or not , " he said . " If I did n't , she 'd make it again and again for me . I could n't stand that . And if I was straightforward , would she ever see me again ? " <p> He decided that honesty with what gentleness he could muster was the best policy . " He said , ' I know you tried hard to get this spaghetti great , ' " she said , " and I do n't want to hurt your feelings . But this spaghetti is terrible . ' " <p> And what happened ? " She learned to make the spaghetti right , " Gagliardi said . " I love her .
