Section : Furniture Making A timeless rocking chair that will give you years of pleasure . <p> Everyone loves a rocker - and it 's easy to see why . This is a chair that 's not designed for anything practical , like eating or working , but simply created for one purpose - relaxation . Combining a welcome break for tired feet and a gentle , soothing motion , it 's the ideal chair for catching up with the news after a hard day on the job or just enjoying a fire on the first cold night of the year . <p> And , with its strong , simple lines , our Arts &; Crafts version is sure to become a favorite in your house . Its timeless design matches almost any decorating scheme and the compact size lets it fit almost anywhere . <p> Best of all , we 've planned our chair so you can put it together with a relatively modest collection of hand tools . While a chair can be a tough project to take on , our rocker falls on the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We used quartersawn white oak for this piece - typical of Arts &; Crafts furniture . However , any hardwood will do . <p> If possible , buy lumber from a dealer who can plane it to the required thicknesses : 13/16 in. for the rails , 15/16 in. for the legs , 1 in. for the rockers , PA in. for the curved back rails and in. for the slats . If your supplier ca n't do this , try a local cabinet shop - most will be glad to help out for a nominal fee . We chose to have an upholsterer create the seat for our chair . Preparing The Pieces <p> Use a ripping guide and circular saw to bring your stock down to the required widths ( Photo 1 ) . To make the cuts safely and accurately , clamp the wide stock to some scrap blocks on your worktable and use two hands to control the saw . Rip the slat and rail blanks slightly oversize , and use a plane and sandpaper to smooth the sawn surfaces . Then use a speed square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo 2 ) . When cutting the chair legs , leave the blanks several inches longer than specified . You 'll trim the legs to finished size after assembling the frame . <p> Next , make a template for the rockers from a piece of - in. - thick plywood or hardboard . Trace the outline of the template onto the rocker stock . By nesting the two rockers on the blank , you 'll minimize waste . Cut the rockers from the blank with a sabre saw ( Photo 3 ) , keeping the blade on the waste side of the line . <p> Clamp one of the rockers to the worktable and use a sharp spokeshave to smooth the inside curve ( Photo 4 ) . Turn the rocker over and use either a plane or the spokeshave to smooth the other side . <p> Make a template for the rear leg , trace the shape onto the leg blanks and cut out the legs with a sabre saw . Clamp two legs together , plane away the saw marks and bring them to final shape . On the back sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area where the straight bottom portion of the leg meets the tapered top section . Chair Joinery <p> Mark the locations of rail mortises in the chair legs , and use a plunge router with a spiral upcutting bit and edge guide to cut the mortises ( Photo 5 ) . You could also bore a series of holes using a doweling jig to guide the drill . In either case , use a sharp chisel to finish the mortises . <p> Carefully lay out the tenons on the ends of the straight chair rails . Note that the side rails have angled tenons and tenon shoulders . Clamp a rail against the edge of the worktable with one end facing up , then use a backsaw to cut the tenon cheeks ( Photo 6 ) . Keep the saw kerf on the waste side of the layout line . <p> After making all the cheek cuts , make a guide from a 2-in. - thick block of wood for cutting the tenon shoulders . For the side rails , cut the end of the guide block at the specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders at the top and bottom edges of each tenon . Finally , use a sharp chisel to pare the tenon cheeks so the tenons fit their respective mortises . <p> Lay out the curved back-rail shape , including the tenons , on the appropriate blanks , then cut the tenons using the same technique . Clamp one of the blanks , inside face up , to the worktable and make a series of cuts with your circular saw to define the inside face of the rail ( Photo 8 ) . Keep the cuts about 1/16 in. above the layout line . Then chop away the large waste chunks with a chisel ( Photo 9 ) . Smooth the concave surface with a spokeshave , working from both ends toward the center to keep the grain from tearing ( Photo 10 ) . <p> Turn the blank over , chop away most of the waste from the convex surface of the rail ( Photo 11 ) and smooth with a block plane or spokeshave . <p> Lay out the slat mortises in the side and back rails , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doweling jig to bore away most of the waste from each mortise ( Photo 12 ) . Finish the mortises with a chisel ( Photo 13 ) and chamfer the top of each rear leg as shown in the drawing . Assembly <p> Install the slats in a bottom side rail ( Photo 14 ) , then fit the top rail over the slat ends . Repeat for the opposite side and set the two subassemblies aside . You do n't need any glue if the slats fit snugly . <p> Assemble the slats with the curved back rails . Then , apply glue to the upper and lower back-rail tenons and leg mortises , and join the back parts . Clamp the joints and compare opposite diagonals to check that the frame is square ( Photo 15 ) . <p> Apply glue to the front-rail/leg joints , assemble the parts and clamp . When the glue has set , join the side-rail/slat subassemblies to the front and rear legs ( Photo 16 ) . Stand the chair on a flat surface to check that the legs are even . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into alignment . <p> Lay out the corner-block angled ends and cut them to length with a backsaw . Bore and countersink pilot holes as shown in the drawing , and install the blocks with 1-in. flathead screws ( Photo 17 ) . <p> Lay the chair on its side and clamp one of the rockers to the legs , positioning it as shown in the drawing . Mark the location of the rocker on two of the legs ( Photo 18 ) , remove the rocker and cut the legs with a hacksaw . Repeat for the other rocker . Test the fit between the legs and the rockers , and make any necessary adjustments so the rockers fit tightly against the leg ends . <p> When you 're satisfied with the fit , clamp the rockers to the chair and drill a - in. - dia. hole through the rockers into the bottom end of each leg ( Photo 19 ) . Cut a dowel for each joint about in. longer than the hole depth . Use a sharp chisel to cut a small groove down the length of each dowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure a strong joint , we used epoxy for the leg/rocker joints . Mix the epoxy according to the instructions and spread some in the holes and on the dowel surfaces . Tap the dowels into the holes and allow the epoxy to cure . Saw the protruding dowels about 1/16 in. above the rockers , and pare the remaining waste with a sharp chisel . Finishing <p> Sand all of the chair surfaces with 120- , 150- , 180- and 220-grit sandpaper , dusting off thoroughly when changing grits . <p> To achieve a traditional medium brown finish , we stained our chair with Behlen Solar Lux American Walnut . This solvent-based stain dries very quickly , so for application with a brush or rag it is best to add Behlen 's retarder to slow drying and prevent lap marks . Follow the manufacturer 's directions for application . <p> Allow the stain to dry thoroughly before applying a surface finish . We used three coats of Waterlox Original Sealer/Finish . Liberally coat all surfaces using a brush or rag . Allow the finish to soak into the wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it dry overnight . Lightly sand the surface with 320-grit sandpaper and remove sanding dust before applying a second coat . Apply the third coat the same way . After overnight drying , burnish with 4/0 steel wool and polish with a soft cloth . <p> Take your chair to an upholsterer to have a slip seat made . While we chose a leather seat , you can use any material that suits your decor . Fasten the seat to the chair with screws driven through the corner blocks into the seat base platform .
