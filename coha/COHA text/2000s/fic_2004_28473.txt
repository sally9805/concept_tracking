Chapter One Eric Caldwell walked a fine line with the law , but he did n't care . He had trusted the Feds before and people had died . He did n't intend to let it happen to this witness . Even if he and his brother , Cain , fought again . Cain , always the good guy , the one on the right side of the law . The man who never saw the grays . The only color Eric did see . " Come on , Eric , where 's the witness in the Bronsky case ? " Cain asked . " What ? " Sarcasm laced Eric 's voice . " Did the police lose another witness ? " " We do the best we can , " his brother said . " Do you know where he is ? " Eric grabbed a Marlboro and pushed it into the corner of his mouth . " Sorry , ca n't help you , bro . " Cain hissed , his message ringing loud and clear . Eric was lying , but Cain knew better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could to keep the witness alive . " You ca n't go around undermining the cops and the FBI , Eric , or killing every criminal who escapes the system . " He glared at Cain over the duffel bag he 'd been packing . " I did n't kill anyone . " Cain 's gaze turned deadly . " I do n't want to see your vigilante ways get you in trouble . It 's like you 're on a death mission , taking everything into your own hands . " Cain 's voice thickened . " One day you 're going to cross the wrong people . " Eric ignored the concern in Cain 's warning , zipped his bag , then threw it over his shoulder , grabbed his keys and strode toward the door . " Like you do n't cross the wrong kind all the time . " " It 's not the same thing , " Cain argued . " I have people covering me . You 're on your own . " Eric hesitated . " You could quit the force and help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New Year 's has come and gone , " Cain said . Their gazes locked briefly and Eric 's stomach clenched . His brother was serious . " Join the force , Eric , and work with the law , not against us . " But Eric could not fit the mold . " I guess we hit that impasse again . " He snagged his laptop off the counter . Cain 's jaw tightened . " Watch your back . If you get into trouble - " " Then you 'll be there to help me . " A cocky grin slid onto Eric 's face . " Now , I 'd love to stay and talk politics but I got ta go . " Cain caught his arm before he could fly past . " Where are you going ? " Eric stared him down hard , the way he had when they were boys and they 'd argued over whether or not to interfere when things had gone sour at home . When their father had taken his rage out on their mother and them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched teeth . " Legitimate business at the ranch . " His brother studied him , did n't believe him . Eric did n't care . Or maybe he did , but he would do what he had to do anyway . Mottled storm clouds rolled across the sky as he headed outside , thunder rumbling above the trees . The wind howled off the lake , a haunting reminder of the bleakness that had become his life . He did n't have time for self-analysis , though . He had to get the witness to a safe house , then meet that woman his friend Polenta had sent his way . She 'd sounded desperate , as if she was in trouble . And there was a kid involved . Some baby named Simon . The woman had n't made sense . She claimed they were after the baby , that he was the product of a research experiment . He 'd known then he had to help her and the child . He 'd even considered confiding in Cain , but she had turned to him for a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason he did what he did . Eric could never say no to a woman or child in trouble . Not when his own past haunted him , when memories of his mother 's suicide still sent sweat trickling down his spine . Years ago , he 'd started working with an underground organization to help women escape abusive homes so they did n't meet the same fate , and their children did n't suffer from abuse themselves . Someone had to help them break the cycle . He jogged down the front-porch steps two at a time , heading toward the lean-to where he 'd parked the Jeep . Thankfully , his brother followed him to the porch . The witness was hiding in the back room , waiting to escape out the side door , then slip through the woods to the SUV . Rocks and gravel sprayed beneath his boots as he walked , the sting of his brother 's disapproval burning his back . He shrugged it off , tossed his duffel bag into the back seat along with his computer and saw the witness crawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to retrieve the cash he kept stashed in the shed for emergencies . Shaded by the thick forest of trees between his property and the road , he stepped toward the knotty pines . But a sudden explosion rent the air , the impact throwing him against a tree . Glass shards and flying metal assaulted him . He banged his head and tasted dirt , then jerked around on his knees in shock . His Jeep had exploded . A fireball rolled off it toward the sky . Ignoring the blinding pain that seared him , he lurched forward to rescue the witness , but another explosion rocked the ground and sent him hurling backward again into the woods . Fire breathed against his skin , catching his clothes and singeing his arms and legs . A jagged rock pierced his skull . The world went momentarily dark , the crackle of fire eating into the night . Eric pulled himself from the haze and tried to yell for help , but his vocal cords shut down . The smoke and fire robbed him of air . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh . Pain , intense and raw , seared him . Flames clawed at his face , and pieces of hot metal stabbed his thigh . Then dizziness swept over him . He released a silent scream into the night , welcoming death and telling his brother goodbye . ( Continues ... )
