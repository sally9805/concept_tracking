Eight years ago , how many people thought that tapes of old games like the 1979 Rose Bowl or the 1968 World Series could have much value ? Brian Bedol did . As a developer of Nickelodeon 's all-rerun Nick at Nite sitcom programming in the early 1980s , he had proved , as he puts it , that " once you take something out of the attic , polish it and put it on display , it becomes an antique . " So in 1995 Bedol created the Classic Sports Network and showed that the allure of sports TV is more powerful than most people imagined . ESPN bought Classic Sports in 1997 for $180 million , with Bedol making millions ( he wo n't be more specific ) . <P> Today Bedol , 44 , is again pushing ignored goods , as a co-founder and the president of College Sports Television ( CSTV ) , the only 24-hour network devoted solely to college athletics . Major broadcast networks , as well as cable outlets like ESPN and Fox Sports Net , already have dibs on big-conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in April , will field a second-string lineup of college sports , including basketball and football from conferences such as the Horizon League ( Butler , Detroit Mercy , Youngstown State ) , plus track , baseball , soccer , lacrosse , volleyball and  --  yes  --  squash . CSTV joins several niche sports networks  --  the Tennis Channel , the Ice Channel , Black Belt TV  --  in launch mode this year . But many analysts vote CSTV most likely to succeed . " College sports fans are rabid , and CSTV holds the category , " says Neal Pilson , former head of CBS Sports . <P> CSTV has the cash to give it a go . Bedol and co-founders Steve Greenberg ( who helped start Classic Sports ) and Chris Bevilacqua ( who has negotiated TV deals for Nike ) started pitching the concept to athletic conferences and cable operators two years ago . Last spring Bedol , Greenberg and Allen &; Co. , a New York City investment bank ( and Greenberg 's employer ) , put up $10 million . In a viewer survey last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed channels , CSTV ranked No. 1 . <P> Thus armed , CSTV has secured an additional $90 million , including investments from Constellation Ventures , ( a Bear Stearns fund ) , football legend Joe Namath and Athlon Ventures , a fund whose participants include NBA star Kevin Garnett and Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson . Coca-Cola is in for $10 million , plus a $5 million marketing partnership . For programming , among other deals , CSTV has bought national rights to all sports other than basketball and football from Notre Dame , which has millions of fans . DirecTV , the satellite operator recently acquired ( from GM 's Hughes Electronics ) by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. , has agreed to place CSTV on its sports tier , which reaches some 2.5 million subscribers and should benefit from aggressive News Corp . marketing . <P> Bedol says additional distribution deals for access to 40 million subscribers are pending with eight of the country 's Top 10 cable operators . He expects $5 million in total revenues this year and to break even , at around $40 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
