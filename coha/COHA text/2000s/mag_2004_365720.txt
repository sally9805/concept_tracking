One of the tips Steve Rosenthal gives his new foot soldiers is this : When you come to a house with a fence , rattle the gate before opening it . Why ? " Big dogs , " he says , laughing . These are the things you learn when you have been at the get-out-the-vote game for more than two decades . The son of a shoe salesman , Rosenthal , 51 , grew up on Long Island , N.Y. , and got his start in politics organizing unions in New Jersey . Few in Democratic politics have shown the kind of results that Rosenthal did as head of the AFL-CIO 's political operation from 1996 to 2002 . In the 2000 election , union members accounted for only about 16% of the voting-age population but produced 26% of the votes ; two of three union votes went to the Dems . <P> Now the rumpled Rosenthal is trying to work the same magic for the Democratic Party as a whole . He has $125 million at his disposal  --  including $10 million from billionaire George Soros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party spent getting out the vote in 2000 . Rosenthal 's America Coming Together is the largest of the new political-advocacy organizations known as 527s for the section of the tax code that created them . On Election Day , Rosenthal expects to have 45,000 paid workers on the streets rounding up every Democrat they can find to vote . The secret , he insists , is staying in touch with those he has signed up . " You talk to people about issues they care about . You talk to them a lot , " he says . " You get as close as you can to them . " <P> But you stay away from their dogs  --  and imposing white turkeys like the one recently encountered in West Virginia guarding a house with menace in its eye . Rosenthal laid down a challenge to his canvasser : Get past the turkey . It took a few tries , but it was worth the risk . Says Rosenthal : " It turns out there were four Democrats in that house .
