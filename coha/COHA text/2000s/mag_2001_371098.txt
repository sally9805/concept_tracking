Brazilian singer-songwriter Moreno Veloso , 28 , sings like a sleepy puppy dog and strums his acoustic guitar as if it were liable to crumble in his arms . On Music Typewriter ( Hannibal ) , the first album by his group , Moreno Veloso + 2 , his sweetness is offset by the steely rhythmic support provided by Domenico Lancelloti on electric drums and Alexandre Kassin on electric bass . In addition , Veloso 's lyrics flow in both warm and cold , bristling with restraint one moment and full of affection and vulnerability the next . On Arrivederci , he sings , in Portuguese , " I do n't like you that much/But every time you leave me/I confess I ca n't forget you , girl . " <P> Veloso 's influences range from the bossa-nova and samba bands of his native land to the New York City new-wave group DNA . " Of course , there are influences on Music Typewriter from electronic music , from jazz , from experimental music and other things , like old funk , " says Veloso , who lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that for us is totally Brazilian . " <P> He 's right : Brazilians were mixing local rhythms with international rock styles well before his father , Caetano Veloso , helped pioneer the Tropicalia movement in the ' 60s . And if Brazil continues to produce albums as delicate and emotionally complex as Music Typewriter , that country 's music will occupy as honored a place in the 21st century as it did in the 20th . <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent
