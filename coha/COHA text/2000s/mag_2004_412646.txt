// Do your parents give you chicken soup when you have a cold ? For centuries , many Europeans and Americans have believed that chicken soup can help cure a cold . In Southeast Asia , on the other hand , people prefer to sip bird 's nest soup when they have runny noses and stuffy heads . Bird 's nest soup does contain both chicken broth and chicken meat . But tradition says that the soup 's healing powers come from the bird 's nest . Maybe you think , Yuck ! Soup made from a bird 's nest would make me feel worse , not better . Maybe you have visions of feathers , twigs , and bits of string floating around in a bowl of water . But the nests used in making bird 's nest soup are not like the nests you may have seen where you live . Bird 's nest soup is made from the nest of the tiny swiftlet . Swiftlets live and raise their young in remote caves on islands along the coasts of Vietnam , Singapore , Myanmar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests from long , gooey saliva strands that come from two glands under their tongues . The birds coil the threads of saliva into nests shaped like half a teacup . They attach them high off the ground against the walls of caves . The saliva hardens like quick-drying cement and holds the nests securely to the almost vertical cave walls . Harvesting swiftlet nests is dangerous work . Men climb barefoot for hundreds of feet up flimsy bamboo ladders . They carry lighted torches between their teeth . There are no ropes to catch them if they fall . When a collector finds a nest , he reaches for it with a long pole that has a three-pronged fork on the end of it . In order to protect the swiftlets as much as possible , only empty nests are harvested . When the swiftlets return to the cave and find their nests gone , they will build new ones . // Before the swiftlets ' nests can be made into soup , they must be soaked or boiled in water . This separates the strands of saliva from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it easier for workers to pick out and discard feathers and other impurities . The clean , boiled " noodles " can then be used to make bird 's nest soup . They can also be used to stuff a chicken or cooked with coconut milk to make a dessert . Many people are concerned about the continued survival of the swiftlets who bring bird 's nest soup to the world . The forests where the birds feed are being cut down at a rapid rate . As the birds disappear , nests are becoming more difficult to find . Thirty-five years ago , a pound of nests sold for about $30 . Because the nests are rarer now , they can cost $1,000 a pound . A bowl of bird 's nest soup costs about $50 in a Hong Kong restaurant . If it really cured colds , it would be worth much more than that . But scientists have their doubts . Researchers at Hong Kong University found that the nests contain a protein that may indeed be beneficial to the human immune system . But the protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into soup destroys the protein . American scientists are also interested in learning whether soups can help people suffering from colds . They have found that sipping a hot liquid from an open cup helped clear mucus from patients ' noses . And they have discovered that chicken broth-as found in chicken and bird 's nest soups-does this more effectively than plain hot water . Even if it does n't help cure a cold , a bowl of hot soup is comforting and delicious . Here 's a soup recipe you and your parents might like to try . As we said , swiftlet nests are very expensive , and they 're not easy to find in American stores . So this recipe for Mock Bird 's Nest Soup uses noodles instead of nests .
