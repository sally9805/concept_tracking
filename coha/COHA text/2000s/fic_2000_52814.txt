The remarkable thing in dreams : people say what he never hears in waking . Fat . They say it to his face , not behind his back , or clear of earshot . The word is succulent in their mouths  --  Faaat  --  stretching out like the waist on his sansabelt pants . Nothing derogatory about it , only an unabashed honesty . On these mornings , for a few moments , he wakes feeling curiously relieved . <p> Clarence John Softitch , Pinky to his friends , at five foot eight and four hundred and eighty-two pounds on a good day , is fat , not large , big , or big-boned . Not hefty , husky , generous , or oversized . Nor robust , portly , or pleasingly plump . He is fat . Enormous . Corpulent . And no delicate euphemisms or polite evasions can relieve him of this knowledge when every movement , whether tying a shoe or climbing a short flight of stairs , becomes a labor of the heart . <p> Not that he has much to do with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scrappy town of twenty-odd thousand on the eastern edge of the state where the paltry rainfall encourages prickly pear in lawns and twelve percent of the population is on welfare . He works as night janitor at Loyola High School , and when most the town 's folk are gathered in families for dinner , or socially at Hogan 's Bar , Pinky 's company is the clatter of scrub bucket , mop , and brush . For solace he has his voice  --  a fine , clear tenor to fill the empty rooms . He sings , " When the moon hits your eye like a big-a pizza pie , that 's amore . " <p> Not that he knows anything about that . Amore , that is . <p> For he is virginal , a moderate embarrassment at his age , having come to terms , he believes , with the reality that no one loves a fat man . And so he has given up on love , the daydreams , the hope , the mooning about , the unsightly chase and precipitous rejections . Until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly food shopping trips , when he sees her in the produce aisle of the northside A &; B grocery , a rutabaga under her nose , a peckish look about her mouth . She 's little . A narrow , neatly planed body . There is about her the solidity , the starkness of a lightning rod . <p> He finds this fascinating ; more than that it stirs him in a way he 's never imagined , his feet locked like a stammer , his breast tightening unlike the usual angina . But what is it about this woman ? Her shoulders pinned at attention  --  the fierce way she sniffs out the proper rutabaga , so that he feels intimidated . Dwarfed , really . For although Pinky knows himself to be large  --  talcums each pant leg to keep his thighs from chafing , avoids chairs with arms  --  he 's always believed himself small , just a tiny voice chirping on the horizon , flotsam in an ocean of flesh . He 's amazed at how his vessel sloshes and wags , jiggles and rolls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide . He can not imagine being of consequence in the larger world beyond bumped tables and broken chairs , the numerous bruises and insulted flesh so common that he has ceased to wonder at the many ways the world is rigged against the fat . <p> But standing in the grocery aisle , he knows for the first time in his forty-odd years what it means to be struck by love . <p> She passes on the rutabagas , and even as she 's whisking out of produce , he 's slipping the vegetable under his nose and then into his cart , perhaps as a keepsake , as he 's never actually eaten one , does n't know what to do with the thing bowling down the cart 's length , tippling stacked , frozen dinners  --  breaded fish sticks ; Hungry Man slabs of Salisbury steak , mashed potatoes , and gravy ; lasagna ; chicken Kiev  --  and the comfort foods : donut holes , potato chips , a baker 's dozen Hostess Ho-Ho 's , chocolate cheesecake as a chaser . A front wheel turned sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling everyone 's attention , he thinks , as he trails her to the checkout lane before he 's actually ready . <p> He tries not to stare , but admires the efficiency of her moves . She retrieves each item with a lean elegance , and he hangs on to the cart handle , dizzy with love , half hopes she notices the rutabaga . When she leaves the store , she 's burdened by six plastic sacks hanging plumb from her fists . She staggers out and pauses in the sunlight , the door frozen open at her back so that the heat wafts in and he imagines her body , that small dark column , immune to the glare of sun on concrete , her clothes dry , armpits forever fresh . <p> By the time he 's checked out , she 's gone , and as he pulls onto the street he sees her struggling down the block . He closes his teeth against the knocking of his heart and idles behind her , the wide-body Chevy wallowing like a whale in the shallows as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Can I give you a lift ? " he asks . <p> She angles a suspicious look at him  --  the friendly stranger  --  but then she stiffens her back along with her upper lip and marches on . <p> " Just a ride . I 'm safe , " he says and has to steer around a parked car . <p> She glances over her shoulder . " Do I look like I need help ? " she says . She crooks her elbows and flexes tidy biceps , causing the plastic bags to twist in slow revolutions , and from the cottonwoods , white duff spindles down into curbside drifts , a goldfinch flits overhead  --  a stab of yellow and gone  --  and still she holds the bags high , until Pinky begins to feel he is that assortment of odd bulges and bumps bundled in an unsightly sack turning this way , then that . <p> Of course she does n't need help , certainly not from him , and he ducks his head in apology , cheeks flushing with an old but familiar heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he touches a finger to his forehead , as if to tip a cap , and accelerates down the street as though his heart were still intact . <p> It 's a full week before he sees her again , which is odd , because it turns out she 's his new neighbor , rents the old Grieger house kittycorner . Though given his daytime schedule of sleep and hermitage he has n't noticed the lights on , the mail delivery , the mowed lawn , before this moment . Curious also is how he recognizes her , half-concealed as she is beneath the draped branches of a weeping birch , her back to him , head tilted so that the short nap of hair twists into something like a question mark against her neck . No more clue than the spine 's rigidity , the belligerence in her stance , and still Pinky 's heart begins to toll . He wishes he were driving , but these last three nights he 's begun an exercise program  --  walking the three blocks to work and back . Morbidly obese , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sadly , which is the way he 's preferred to construe it . Midway second block , he 'll be winded , and by the time he reaches the school door the back of his shirt will be sweated in the early evening cool . He 'd walk by her house without stopping , but she 's noticed him , turns , and by the look on her face he can tell she ca n't place him . He tries not to waddle , wishes he were wearing something other than Carhartt coveralls . He tips his finger to his forehead and gives it away . <p> " The man in the car , " she says . <p> He nods , pleased in spite of himself . He toes up to the lawn to extend a hand . Her own hand disappears in his , but her grip shakes him . " I live in the yellow house . " He points over his shoulder . He tells her his name , says , " Call me Pinky , " and he wants to say , All my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surge of despair . What folly . What gall . What enormous odds . It 's overwhelming , this business of love . <p> " Pinky , " her voice rises . " Rose . I 'm Rose Spencer . " She does n't release his fingertips , instead stalks up the lawn with Pinky in tow . " Tell me , what this is ? " Rose disengages her hand to point at a branch . In the upper reaches there is a cocoon , a tented web , with freckled bits splotted here and there . In yet another branch , he sees the start of another , and how is it that he has n't noticed them before ? He sights down the row of cottonwoods streetside , the upper reaches . He sighs . <p> " Tent caterpillars , " he says . He hopes she does n't register the way his flesh quivers as he thinks of the frantic shivering of worms overhead . A phobia , like some folks have for snakes , spiders . <p> " Are they bad ? For the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat their way down a branch , mature , and drop like fruit . He backs up a pace . No more than a couple tents . Not so bad . " We 'll keep an eye on them . " And suddenly he 's using " we , " and such audacity stuns him . But she lets him get away with it , nodding her head and escorting him off her lawn . <p> " If you need anything , " he says . " I have a car , " he says , " for groceries , anything . " She 's watching , and he has the sense she 's backing away , though her feet are still rooted to the edge of the lawn . " I 'm safe , " he says , ducks his head . <p> " How 's that ? " she asks . <p> He flushes . Ca n't believe he 's saying this . " Well , you can probably run faster than I can . " He laughs as he 's always had to . <p> Rose arches an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect from me . " She crosses her arms , cups an elbow in each palm . " But I 'm tapped out when it comes to men . Pity , love , anger , compassion  --  you name it , and I 've exhausted it . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Pinky says , and he means it . He wonders what could have hurt her so deeply , briefly envies her pain , the experience of being close enough to wound or be wounded . And then , of course , he realizes that 's nonsense . Believes he has the perfect vantage for sympathy , from behind this great bulwark of flesh . He 's thinking of himself now  --  the lifetime alone , avoiding pain . He runs a hand down his chest , down the globe of his belly , a gesture he 's developed over the years familiarizing himself with the expanding boundaries of his body . " We 're neighbors , " he says , and she seems puzzled , but there 's something in his face , or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxes the grip on her arms , and says , " Neighbors . I can handle that . " <p> It 's his turn to be confused now . He checks his watch , then looks west , to the sunset , as though that might be more accurate . " I have to get on to work  --  over at the school ? I 'm the maintenance technician . " A smile sweeps across his face . " Night janitor . " He avoids her eyes , looks over her shoulder , and the hills rising above the town turn amber , then the color of autumn rushes and where the light catches the grasses , the bunched sage , it is a luminous fire . It occurs to him just how long it 's been since he 's seen the hills , wonders how it is that he could have moved through these days , these months without noticing how the crowns levitate with light above the rim rock , the dimming crevasses . He backs up a step , and as she turns her attention once again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the other until he finds himself three blocks gone and on the steps of school . He unlocks the door with a jangle of keys , lets them loose to the satisfying snatch and click of the take-up reel , then enters the building . He clamps the door shut , and , flipping on hall lights , he breaks into his best Johnny Mathis voice , " Chances are ... " <p> They shop together now . One day a week . Separate carts . He 's taken it upon himself to keep Rose advised on lawn maintenance . " It 's the first yard I 've ever taken care of , " she confides , and so he understands she 's always had a man , and no , he wo n't infringe because it 's obvious she takes delight in adding oil to the lawn mower gasoline , or pruning the boxwood hedges , regards each task as an indication of competence in the larger world . " I believe a person could fix anything , " she says in the house utensils aisle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , " Except trust . " And this is the first hint she 's given of what keeps her so clearly focused on staying " neighborly . " <p> Not that he 's done much more than buddy his grocery cart up to hers , and although it 's true , the contents have more and more begun to resemble hers , still he keeps a cautious distance . He 's at a standstill , and all the month of long hours mulled over the mop handle at work , dreaming up ways to woo and win her , have yielded nothing more than any neighbor could claim . <p> Until today , when she lets slip the tidbit about trust . And then the store manager , Ray Tipp , an old classmate  --  a starved-looking man who keeps himself anxious with coffee  --  checks out Pinky 's groceries , says , " Got a sale on Hostess Ho-Ho 's . " He lifts a head of broccoli and Roman Meal bread . " You on a diet ? " <p> Pinky ca n't even run . He feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment . He shuffles between the checkout stands , the backside of his trousers snag on a magazine rack , and he endures Ray 's curiosity while he frees himself without spilling Vogue and Look into the aisle . He pays Ray , lifts his bagged groceries from the grinning stock boy . He knows that this , too , Rose must see , how the young boy 's eyes widen and the whites shine like twin moons , roll in their sockets . <p> Stupid . Stupid to have invited her along . To see this . Still stupid  --  after all these years  --  to aim yourself at inevitable hurt . But the damage is done . Rose , after all , is guilty by association , and so he pivots on his heel , the great slowing mass of him , to face this small woman and take her disgust in stride . <p> She 's handing money to Ray . Two twenties , a ten . She fishes out a single and another . Some change . She takes her bags from the boy and waits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the grace he can muster . When he breaks out into the sunshine , his heart is cluttering his chest , so huge , so full it 's become . He puffs crossing the parking lot , the bags swinging at his sides , and he sets them on the ground to open the car door for her . <p> Two blocks from the store , she says , " Why do n't you pull into the park ? I 've bought a melon . We can have a bite . " <p> Just like that . <p> And why not ? he thinks . A picnic , something he has n't done since his mother passed on , and for a brief moment he can almost hear her , see the woman she was , all comfort  --  bosomy and dimpled elbows  --  pressing food onto him , the sound of other children chasing and laughing . He is hiccuping tears . " Eat , " she says . " Like a good boy . Never mind those others . They 're jealous you got ta momma can cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your daddy was a big man . " By this he understands that he , too , would be ... large ... and in her eyes that was good . <p> Rose directs him onto River Street and down to the small riverside park . He used to come here as a younger man , walked the levy at night to imagine himself with a woman , strolling the paths or swooning on a bench in the grip of passion and the moony night , like any one of a number of couples whispering from behind the willows ' curtains , or lolling in the tall , blue grasses riverside . <p> He follows Rose 's lead , carrying the plastic-sacked melon in both hands like a gift , an offering of the magi , and she brings them to the base of a cottonwood . He is breaking a sweat , and the air is brilliant with light on water so that he squints the moisture from his eyes , releases a great round sigh , " Aaah , " and he 's just so damned grateful for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's unlikely to recover his voice any time soon so he sighs again . <p> Rose has seated herself in the grass . He wishes she were wearing a flowing skirt , frilly blouse , a wide-brimmed straw hat , instead of the baggy jeans and T-shirt that slouch on her tiny frame , and then he feels an ingrate . Clothes . What do they signify ? Certainly not the moment . She takes the melon from him , plops it in her lap like a placid child , then pats the grass beside her , and he faces the task of lowering himself . Pinky thinks to remain standing , strike a noble pose , but she 's already gazing off across the wide , blue river to the hills opposite . He braces one hand against the tree , crooks a knee , stretches the other leg behind , and bends cautiously forward and down and down some more . It 's a struggle against mass , gravity . His joints pop in series . He tries not to gasp or puff , and that 's nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wishbone , ready to snap , and then he 's down without having fallen . His face is red ; he can tell . He filches a handkerchief out of his rear pocket and towels off his forehead , neck , the skinny V of flesh between the unbuttoned top of his button-up shirt . <p> " Do you have a knife ? " she asks . <p> And he does , though he must lean back , lift his stomach , and squeeze his hand in the narrow flap of cloth , cutting the blood to his fingers as he feels for the knife . Finally , he frees it , a pocket Buck knife with all the appointments  --  even a corkscrew . But she lifts the knife away , slaps the screw back into its steel nest , and locks open the large blade . She stabs into the melon 's meat , saws a chunk free , and scrapes the seeds back into the exposed heart of the fruit . She hands the wedge to him , and he waits for her to join him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says , sinks the knife to the hilt into the melon 's rind . " Take my advice . Never fall in love with them . " <p> Pinky laughs , but it 's a squeezed little thing , his chest constricting . <p> " You think you know cruelty , I know you do . " She saws into the melon . " But the cruelty of strangers , or friends , is nothing , " she wags a finger in his face , " compared to what love can do . " She is tightlipped . Her brows beetle , and the air about her seems charged with a static energy . She bites into the melon , tells him about her first husband , his one-night stands , moves on to her second husband and his affairs . Tells it all in four short sentences , as if she ca n't bite off the ends of words hard enough , spit it out fast enough . <p> " What did I learn from it , you want to know ... " <p> She dabbles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some melon juice drips down , and Pinky thinks he has never seen anything more delectable . He 'd like to take her finger into his mouth and suck it dry . <p> She stretches her legs out , leans against the tree , and tells him of her third and last husband 's affairs . How she then called the woman , wanted to see her . " Could n't help myself . Called a complete stranger  --  though it seemed I had the right , we 'd shared so much . I do n't know what I expected . She came to my house . Not the first time , I could tell that right off  --  the way she found her way to his chair . " <p> Rose rubbed the back of her head against the tree 's bark , a leisurely scratching . " She was a short , stumpy-legged little thing , not cute , no , not even handsome . But interesting . Perky . She says , I did n't mean to ruin your life . ' She was being sincere , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my life was n't ruined . Merely changed . I told her that . " <p> She looked over at Pinky . " Do n't you wonder at how I could be so collected ? So smug ? " <p> " I ca n't imagine , " Pinky says . <p> " No . " She leans over , pats his hand . " Of course you ca n't . And of course , I was full of crap . " She sighed . " If my life was n't ruined , it was the next thing to it . Rubble . That 's what I was left with . Rubble . " <p> She squeezes her left breast , and Pinky knows it is her heart she means , but all he can picture is the tender flesh crumpled in her fist , and he wants to loosen her fingers , cradle her breast and heart in the palm of his hand , which he discovers is sweating so he swipes it down his pant leg . And then , wonder of all wonders , he reaches over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifts the knife away , slices another piece , skins and offers it to her . <p> Which she declines . <p> " Three strikes , you 're out . Is n't that right ? " she asks . <p> " In baseball , " Pinky says , and he wants to sound decisive , but hears how his voice trails off . He 's stuck with the melon wedge , dripping through his fingers onto his pant leg . <p> " Yes , " she agrees . " In baseball and in men . " <p> And what can Pinky say ? He eats the melon slice , wipes his hand on the grass . On the river , a pair of Canada geese paddle upstream , six goslings drafting in their wake . Sunlight crooks across the water 's surface , and shadows swim the face of the hills opposite . Pinky blinks , feels moisture budding behind his eyes , and blinks again . He begins to comprehend the scale of his task  --  wooing this woman-even if he were n't hobbled by his own body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at his belly , wishes he could slice away the flesh , pare down to some more supple version of himself that would be capable of the acrobatics  --  walking , sitting , bending over  --  that normal , everyday people perform in everyday courtship . He wants to be handsome for her . <p> A pair of young girls roller-blade down the sidewalk , the wheels buzzing with the sound of enormous hummingbirds . They wind down the path , skinny legs and arms knotted in protective pads . Their laughter is a shouting , and Pinky admires the honesty of it . He wonders what Rose sounds like when she laughs . He wonders if she laughs . <p> Rubble , she 'd said , and he questions the state her heart 's in now . " I 'm not like those men , " he says . <p> " Why ? " she asks . " Because you 're fat ? " And it 's just a statement . " Because you think other women would n't find you attractive ? " <p> Truth is he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see this could work for him . He nods . <p> " Another way that you 're safe ? " she asks . <p> He nods again , though he feels like he 's stepping into something unseen , something with teeth . <p> She stares across the river . " Do you think that little of yourself , or me ? " <p> It 's worse than he 'd feared , certain now that she despises him for his clumsiness , his transparent eagerness . He blames himself and his lack of experience ; he blames the hour of the day and the bristling grass that torments his ankles . He tells her he 's a fool and that he respects her and her friendship . Those are the words he uses , respect and friendship , and she continues to stare out across the river . He asks her to understand , he 's not used to ... to ... picnics . <p> Her brows furrow , and she says , as if she has n't heard him , " My last husband was different . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookish man with a sense of humor . He could n't change the oil in the car , but he was mad for opera . I believed he was different , as day is to night . " She wags her head . " But finally , he was only a different kind of night . And this is much too lovely a day , " she leans back on her elbows , " to quibble . I 'm done with men . " Rose rolls onto her side , facing Pinky . " Except as friends . Take it or leave it . " <p> Pinky nods and heaves a sigh , but even as she pats his hand and closes her eyes to rest , he is studying the logistics of getting back on his feet . <p> Late at night , in the gym , Pinky plots strategy . He turns on the overheads , and the constellation of bulbs shine from the floor 's mirror finish . He has cleaning down to an art , dry-mopping the area in under an hour , starting at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way in overlapping lanes down and back until he 's dusted his way into the boys ' locker room , where the real work begins . Though , as it is summer , this chore is reduced to a twice weekly touchup instead of the nightly tour during the school year . He switches to a wet mop , fills the big steel bucket on casters with hot water , a splash of disinfectant Sparkle and bleach . He works backwards , kicking the bucket ahead of him like a troublesome dog . The mop bangs against lockers , and Pinky loves the rat-a-tat-tat off the empty doors . Sings " Frankie and Johnnie " to their machine-gun accompaniment . Sees himself as Johnnie , but ca n't imagine doing her wrong , ca n't conceive of such discontent . He rolls the bucket into the boys ' bathroom . Lifts his voice to the tiled walls . At least that 's the way the story goes . Frankie bought everything for Johnnie , from his sports car to his Ivy League clothes . He buffs the floor , glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe it 's just love has transformed him . Or has he lost weight ? He lifts the putty knife from the cart , scrapes at a wad of paper toweling glommed to the underside of a sink . When he straightens up , he fidgets a finger into his waistband , snugs in two . Yes . Oh yes . He 's lost weight . Friend came running to Frankie , said , You know I would n't tell you no lie . I saw your man driving that sports car with a chick named Nellie Bligh <p> And this is the tough part . He enters a stall . How can he convince Rose of his own true heart ? And damn it . He slaps the brush in the toilet bowl , squirts in blue disinfectant , swabs , and flushes . He deserves one good shot at it , does n't he ? He slaps the cover up , scrubs  --  cover down  --  scrubs  --  backs out of the stall , then moves on to the next and the next . Patience , he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend and neighbor a little over two months , he 's got a forty-year backlog of empty nights , and Pinky stops , envisions the calamity of another forty empty years , and finds himself doubled over one of the toilets . When his heart calms in his chest and the angina eases under his left wing bone , he backs out of the stall . The room is bright , as only locker-room bathrooms can be with the high banks of fluorescent lights buzzing and reflecting off the mirrors and stainless steel doors , the white , porcelain sinks and urinals all ablaze so that when he looks in the mirror this time what he sees is his forehead shining with sweat and the enormous bell of his body overexposed in white overalls , and for a moment he loses himself against the white wall tiles . <p> He leaves the bucket and mop , the toilet brush and disinfectant , and crosses back through the locker room , turning off lights as he goes , through the gym and out the side door . He stands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc lamp 's cone of light seethes with winged insects  --  swirling , bumping , a luminous feast that the nighthawks scoop through . Pinky breathes deeply , feels the moist back of his shirt cooling . Crickets pick up where they 'd left off . He steps away from the building and walks until the locked school folds into the night . He walks slow and steady , his heart easing , chest lightening . He knows he will have to return to work , but for now he turns up a side street where lamplight streams out onto porches and grass . <p> He stays to the sidewalk , but glances in each house . Where drapes are open , it 's the furniture he notices  --  which place has a piano , or a lamp centered in the window like a beacon . Then there are all the dining rooms with tables bunkered by chairs . So many chairs . Seascapes over the sofa , mounted deer , or the grouping of family pictures like a lineup in the post office . Once in a while he glimpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner : chicken , hamburger , barbeque ribs . Or more vaguely Italian cuisine , Oriental , Middle East . He feels a stirring of hunger , but he tucks his two fingers into his waistband again and thinks apple instead of apple pie . He journeys down another side street and exchanges greetings with a man smoking a pipe on his front porch . He passes a young couple , and the woman titters , but they do n't notice Pinky , so wrapped up are they , and he finds that utterly disarming . He meets more people strolling under the streetlamps . Why , it seems to him , that the whole town must be spilling out into the warm night . Or maybe this is the way the world congregates when he 's alone , in his school , his home . And there it is . His house . Locked tight and shuttered close . He opens the front door , the drapes , turns on all the lights . Then he steps back out on the sidewalk to see what he can of himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fare so badly . Tomorrow , first thing , he will dig out the old photos , frame the one of his mother and father 's wedding , the portrait of his grandfather  --  big-chested , with thighs like a Percheron . It will take so little , he thinks , and he pivots on his heel to look across the street , to the house of his beloved . The lights behind the drapes are a wan glow , and he 's stricken with how tidy the place is , how self-contained . He feels ... what is it ? Not exactly love , but a stirring that is equally unfamiliar from his end of things , and ... disconcerting  --  call it pity . He wishes he could step into her life as easily as his home , open it wide to this sweet night . He heaves a sigh , and looks up , over the trees and over the tops of houses to where the distant hills shoulder the dark beneath the quickening stars . <p> He means to take her on a date , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare . He mentions the movie , casually , over groceries . He tells Rose , " Dutch treat , " to allay her suspicion . It 's a love story , but he does n't mention that , either . She offers to buy the popcorn . " Only fair , " she says . " All the gas you 've used on grocery trips . " <p> Pinky accepts . He feels pretty smart . Of course he has n't thought about the theater seats , and though his pants are looser now and sitting upright no longer cuts off his wind , still it 's a tight , tight squeeze , but he manages . He 's appreciative for her small kindness of unbuttered popcorn . She 'd noticed his weight loss a couple days ago . " Hope you 're not doing this for me , " she 'd said , and when he replied , " No , " he could see she was unprepared for the truth , some small part of her stung by his admission . He felt encouraged . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the first to ridicule the sentimentality . Except , now it is Rose scoffing , and that provokes in him a desire to defend it . She curls her lip , and Pinky lets his heart go soft . Walking back to the car , she recaps some of the lowlights . When she snorts at the dialogue , Pinky taps her arm with a finger , says , " You could give it a chance . " <p> " You ca n't mean it . " <p> " It had heart , " he says . <p> She pinches his arm . " It had a lobotomy . Not the same thing . " <p> " Ouch , " he says . <p> She goes on , " What you do n't know , " she shakes a finger at him , " is this kind of willful ignorance about the realities of love wearies me sometimes . " <p> They drive away from the theater in silence . He wants to talk , but is embarrassed to admit that there 's little willful about his ignorance . Inexperience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bite , and she agrees . Rose 's hamburger fills her hands , drapes over fingers , lobs chunks of lettuce and pickle into the napkin covering her lap while Pinky 's grilled chicken breast sandwich is a pale , insignificant thing in comparison . It hardly seems worth the effort . He takes baby bites to stretch it out . She offers him a sip of her malt , and it 's so intimate a gesture he 's dumbfounded . He accepts the plastic cup from her hands and takes the straw  --  squeezed between her lips just moments earlier  --  into his mouth , tongues the tip tenderly . It is a jolt of pure chocolate , cold and clean and sweet . His eyes close . <p> So this is what it 's like  --  the taste of a woman , and there 's a curious quivering at the base of his spine . And of course he knows that 's not the case , but he enjoys the idea of it and has to stop himself from draining her malt . <p> " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie . But the point is , " she crumples the emptied hamburger wrapping , " romantic love suggests we are incomplete without another , in need of salvation . You 're led to believe that you 'll be a better person if there 's someone around to expect it . But somewhere down the line , you find the cost of these expectations too dear . What ? you say . Eat the same cooking ? Sleep on the same side of the bed ? Give up variety ? Implausible if not impossible . All you will ask for is a little kindness , but what you will want is more than anybody can give  --  their undivided attention for the rest of their life  --  and so you struggle and struggle and hurt each other endlessly . <p> " Three marriages , over twenty-five years ' worth . Imagine  --  twenty-five years attempting love . Trust me . It 's a complication you 're better off without . " <p> Rose sighs , pats her lips dry , then sets the soiled napkin and empty malt cup back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . She sounds utterly weary . <p> Pinky takes a deep breath , resettles in the seat . His stomach bumps the steering wheel . He drives the long way , down Bridge Street , over to Riverside , up to Highland , slowly . How painful she makes it sound , twentyfive years , but all he can think of is turning over in bed to find someone there , of eating someone else 's cooking , and it sounds grand to Pinky , worth the risk , the heartache . He knows what it 's like to be alone  --  the long haul of it , not the early phase , when the day winds down because you 've nothing better to do and stretching across an empty bed still seems a luxury . <p> It 's coming onto seven in the evening , and the sky is yet bright with daylight . He stops at the school , invites her in . He shows her the broom closet , the mops . He shows her classrooms , the new computer lab  --  shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the gym , throws on the lights just to show her how the floor shines . He stands center court and lobs a high A at her . He could almost swear she blushes . He proceeds to sing the only song he can think of with her name in the title , " The Yellow Rose of Texas . " <p> On the way out of the building , she says , " A most unlikely , but lovely serenade . Thank you . " They leave the car there to walk the three blocks home . He knows she slows her pace to match his . It is early evening , and the shortening daylight lapses into a dim gloaming . Dusky-winged ash aphids are swarming  --  bumbling clouds of blue-bodied mites that rise like yeast from the grass . Late summer , they come down from the Camas and Palouse Prairies to swim in the warmer valley air . By full evening , they will web together in gray winding sheets around the south side of the ash tree trunks , where they will shiver into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squall , riding the turmoil of heat convections and cooling drafts . They speckle the couple 's clothes , dust their hair . Pinky is enthralled with the tiny creatures , the enormous bulb of their bodies and improbable flight . They bobble and fall , rise and fumble . This is not a matter of grace . <p> Rose waves a hand through the air in front of her . They stop on the far edge of the cloud , and Rose ducks her head , swipes at an eye . Pinky can see a bead of aphids riding her eyelashes . <p> " Ow , " she says , her eye tearing . <p> " Here , " he comforts , nips her chin between thumb and forefinger , lifts her face to what is left of the light . Rose is a woman who has little truck with makeup . There 's no attempt to disguise the lines , the thinning skin . He is captivated , as he was the first time he saw her , by the static energy of this woman , her relentless honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . And this is the thing he both fears and admires , how she has been pared down to the bone , tried and fired as he never has been . Though his fingers barely grace her chin , he feels her energy , some galvanic current of old doubts running through her , and she sidesteps under his hand . He takes a steadying breath , says , " Hold still . " He spits on his free thumb , touches that small drop of moisture to the corner of her eye . The speck of blue floats off the white , onto Pinky 's thumb , and he neatly lifts it away . <p> Up and down the block , house lights come on , and children shoo cats out of front doors . The hills over the town flatten , grow larger with the dark . There 's no help for it , but Pinky feels a melancholy he 's hard put to explain , and it has to do with the onset of dark and the sudden still . It has to do with the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lifetime of hiding , in his house , his work , and foremost his own flesh . And , he sees it has to do with fear  --  the way we run through our lives in terror of it  --  and everything to do with despair , and perhaps , he thinks , that is what despair is , finally , a lack of daring . He feels savvy . Overhead , a crow lifts from the treetop , banks toward the river with a hard laugh  --  ha , ha , ha . <p> In another block they stop again so that Pinky can catch his breath . He pants in the quiet , shakes his head . He will lose weight  --  he will because he can not go on as he always has , he understands this now  --  but he also knows he will always be big . Not small , or even trim , and he is struck by this . It has been with him so long , this ocean of flesh . Pinky feels he must tell Rose . Warn her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes , " she agrees . She lays a hand on his forearm . " As I will always be bitter , " she says . <p> They stand that way in the new dark , and he thinks , should a young husband look out from his living room window , or should the young wife hurrying home from errands come across them standing so , they would think Rose and Pinky some middle-aged couple of long years  --  the way Rose 's hand is anchored on his arm . And he wonders about the couples he has so long envied , how much is illusion  --  a public face for the private griefs and hurts they harbor ? He thinks of the depth of Rose 's bitterness , the earnest way in which she confirms it , and he understands it 's as deep and abiding as the bones seated in the continent of his flesh . It humbles him , how fiercely she is grounded in her resolve . <p> And he does not feel up to the task . Sees himself as the lightweight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be consoled by the pat of his hand . How he already misses the easy comfort of food , the anonymity . He feels a nervousness , an anxiousness like a missed meal , or the temptation of chocolate before sleep . He sways from foot to foot , rocking in place . A terror steals upon him that he can not fathom , so that his feet are seized in place and his fat plumbs him to the earth while she stands stark and quiet at his side as if forged of consequences larger than his imagining . He sees she is not the rod , but the lightning itself , flinty bits striking off  --  old loves , grudges , misfortunes , a hundred errors in judgment and more  --  quizzing his friable heart . He should run . He should bolt , for he senses this is a struggle deeper than the naive courtship he 'd embarked on . Not the territory of novices . Not for the uninitiated . It is a journey of days , years , a chronic case of heartache , the relentless wooing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost laughs , for all his assurances to Rose of how safe he is  --  he sees now that it is she who is the danger ... always has been . <p> Overhead , the clouds quail beneath the rising moon . He turns his face away . He slows his panic by imagining the imaginable : the march of days , the orderliness of work  --  nights , cleaning , trips to the grocery store , lawn care , and diets . Conversation that spills over from day to day , and running jokes . He wonders how they will look in a year , two , five . Will she grow generous as he grows slight ? He steadies , takes a deep breath . What he wants , he realizes , more than anything , is to imagine a time when fear will carry no weight in his heart . When love will need no proof . He squints into the dark , as if to make out the features of that distant time  --  the heel of a foot striking the floor as she steps down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , is it Rose ? But he can not know this . Not now . Not yet . And , perhaps , for now , the question is enough . He quashes the impulse to push back his sleeves . Instead , he leads them arm in arm , their bodies swaying each its own way , beneath the steepled canopy of sycamore where the first flush of moonrise swims the wavering shadows in a school of light . <p> <p> By Claire Davis <p>
