<p> Last fall , the Sun-Times assembled a handful of Chicago 's best and brightest to discuss the first title in the city 's " One Book , One Chicago " program  --  Harper Lee 's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird . Our " book club " format proved so successful that the paper decided to convene another equally learned and distinguished panel to discuss the city 's second choice , Night , author and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel 's stark , disturbing account of his Holocaust experience . <p> Participants included Ald. Edward Burke ( 14th ) ; Circuit Judge Sharon Coleman ; attorney and former Chicago School Board president Gery Chico ; Shawnelle Richie , former press secretary for Mayor Harold Washington , and retired Circuit Judge Ilana Rovner , who , as a child , fled Riga , Latvia , to escape the growing Nazi threat . <p> The discussion touched not only on Wiesel 's story and their reactions to it , but also on the Holocaust itself , its parallels to slavery and its bearing on the tumult in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book , One Chicago " programs commence this week , read what some notable Chicagoans thought about the experience of reading Night : <p> Why was ' Night ' chosen ? <p> Ilana Rovner : I would hope that Chicago Public Library Commissioner Mary Dempsey and her staff were trying to get people to consider where hatred , cruelty and misunderstanding of other ethnic groups can take an entire world . <p> Edward Burke : Could it be that someone thought that , given the tremendous unrest in the Mideast and the violence between the Jews and the Arabs , somehow an understanding of the Holocaust could give us a sense of the feelings of so many of the leadership of Israel ? Or could it be as simple as being able to get people to know such a tremendously compelling story in such simple and stark terms and in such a short period of time ? This is a quick read , but yet , a remarkably horrific story . <p> Shawnelle Richie : It was clear to me that it was chosen because it is so incredibly provocative on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said , is compelling . And you are taken on a journey that has , on so many levels , transformed the way I think about the Mideast and what 's going on there now and transformed how I look at my daily life . <p> Rovner : I find it very interesting that you Burke say it 's a quick read . I read this book for the first time in 1960 . I come to it from perhaps a different road than the rest , because I am a survivor . I recall being able to read it quickly in 1960 . But in 2002 , when I picked it up again after all of those years , I could barely turn the pages . I would read two pages and put it down . Then pick it up again and try to read two more pages and put it down . For me , it was an excruciatingly slow read because even though I know it by heart and I know a thousand , 10 thousand other stories by heart , it 's unbearable . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin book , but I had a hard time reading it . I could not read it at night . And I read 50 , 75 pages a night . I could n't do it . I had a hard time . I read about 10 pages at a time and I read it in the morning . And I think a lot of it was due to the youth perspective . Kids need to get this from a young person 's perspective . As the mother of a 13-year-old , I was very very moved . <p> Should kids read ' Night ' ? <p> Burke : Would you urge your 13 year old to read it ? <p> Coleman : Yes , I would , but with my help . <p> Gery Chico : Coming from my background , one of the hardest things that we found was to get young people interested in reading . Obviously , this book , with the subject matter of the Holocaust , is very , very gripping , and I think that one of the objectives is to get young people interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , as a young person , you could read this book and not pick up another one after this experience . <p> Rovner : There 's no question that it 's absolutely unique , because what it is is the experiences of a child told by a child . A child who is literally in hell . So it is n't as if other children can relate , but they are being shown something unimaginable that happened . <p> Coleman : When I really think about it , and maybe I 'm being overprotective of my 13-year-old , this book affected me and my generation and those above me much differently and in a much more horrific manner than the young people . Think of what they look at and see all the time . They have become desensitized to a lot of violence . And so they might be able to handle this . And I think what is important about this is that it is the truth , and they need to know about that and they need to realize that it happened , so that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's the same old story . ' They need to hear this . It really did happen . And just because time has passed by does not make it any less horrific . <p> Richie : He made this book very real . And it depends on your life experience as to how you process it . I can absolutely understand what you 're saying about high schoolers . They might not process it in the same way . What I found particularly interesting is that all of us mentioned at some point how we had to read the book . I had to have quiet . I could n't have any distractions . And it would seem to me that if I were to have read this book with a teenage child of mine that I would have to put some protocol around it . It requires more than just the quick read that a teenager might give it . <p> The Holocaust in hindsight : Why was n't the danger recognized ? <p> Burke : Ilana , I 'm sure you 've thought of this . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what was going on ? Why would they decide to leave early , but yet Wiesel 's family apparently had an opportunity and did n't . Was it a matter of religion ? Was it a matter of wealth ? <p> Rovner : There are two responses . First , my father came to America ahead of my mother and me in 1938 . My mother and I did n't come until the Germans had invaded Poland . But my father and mother had traveled the continent on their wedding trip . My father saw the writing on the wall very clearly . Secondly , my father had the great good fortune of being the opera critic in Riga . His seat at the opera was next to the American consul general . And one night , in the spring of 1938 , the American consul general said to my father , " Have you thought of leaving ? " <p> Burke : But it still takes great courage , does it not , to leave all your roots ? <p> Rovner : It 's beyond my comprehension what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $57 . ... Who in Nazi-occupied Europe could believe such things ? Such madness ? But today I believe that not only would people believe it , they would see it on television . <p> Coleman : Because that 's a leap of faith , to be able to leave like that . And I thought about it from the standpoint of an African American , and the slaves getting a chance to escape or not , and being told about the Underground Railroad , that there is a way to get out , and how they would n't go . " No , we 're better off staying right here . " <p> Burke : But even in the end , in 1944 , the Wiesel family apparently were the last ones to be shipped out . They 'd been put in the ghetto and even then they had an opportunity to leave . I mean , at that point would n't you think , " Run to the woods ! " <p> Rovner : The terror you know is better than the terror you do n't know . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom what was happening . It was too senseless , too mad , too deranged , too bizarre , too ridiculous , too impossible . <p> Chico : Look at Sept. 11th . Who on Sept. 10th would have thought it fathomable that four airplanes would be turned into missiles with human cargo ? I mean , you would shake your head the say it 's impossible . <p> Rovner : Some of you would say it 's impossible . <p> ' Night ' and human nature <p> Burke : It 's even more than just a story of horror and violence . Is n't it also a story of spirituality and coming to grips with the realization that the almighty power that Wiesel had clung to as a youngster and studied in the Torah and the Talmud suddenly does n't apply . And he sees all around him that which he held so close suddenly evaporate . But then , as his father is suffering and Wiesel sees another child abandon his own father , he prays to the God he does n't believe in to give him the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's so true , because the betrayal of the father by the son shocked Wiesel more than the Nazi cruelty , more than the Hungarian fascists ' cruelty to their neighbors , more than anything else . <p> Burke : And what an insight into human nature when the prisoner that is selected from their group is led off and he says to them , " Say the Kaddish for me . " And Wiesel says that when the prisoner was gone they did n't even remember to say the Kaddish for him , they forgot . What does that say about all of us ? Are n't we all subject to the same human frailty ? And maybe that is why this is so bothersome . It tells us what we are all about , that were we in this horrific setting , we 'd be guilty of the same human failings . <p> Rovner : Well , it certainly makes us wonder what we would do , who we would save , how we would react . It makes us ask terribly difficult , uncomfortable , horrible questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've looked at the righteous Christians who gave their lives and took their lives and the lives of their families in their hands , who sacrificed themselves , often for Jews and gypsies and gays and others that they had never even known . And you say to yourself , " Would I have been one of them ? Could I do that ? " So it forces you to look very deep inside your own soul . ... At the same time , of course , you see the beauty of human nature as well . In the book there is the violinist who plays Beethoven as his last act of defiance . <p> Coleman : When I looked at the back of the book and I saw the picture of the three people hanging , I thought about the question we started out with , " Why this book ? And how can we encourage people throughout Chicago to read it ? " And from my standpoint , how can you encourage people in the African-American community to pick up the book and read it ? And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three people hanging and the similarities of lynching , of torture of African Americans over the years . If you add it up over the years , you would have the same horrific numbers . And I think it is important for our community to read this book . They 've got to be able to understand what went on and that there is a connection . I think this book would help the communities to understand the similarity . And not just the African-American community and the Jewish community , but communities that have suffered . Every community has suffered in some way . <p> Richie : One of the things that struck me personally was a deep sense of regret that , as an African American , there was no forum , no way for the slaves ... to leave a legacy like this , to leave a story . And the stories of the Middle Passage have been obscured over time . I imagine a Jewish person would find this book difficult to read , but such a treasure and something to be held up and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , yes . What he 's done is bear witness to the events that happened . It 's a form of therapy , surely . It 's a form of transference . But most of all , you 're absolutely right , it 's an homage . It 's an homage to his mother , his father , his sister , his cousins and his people . <p> The Holocaust and violence in the Middle East <p> Burke : The book gives us an opportunity to understand the mentality of what the Israelis now may be confronting . Now the Israelis have to look around the world to their allies and think , just as in 1944 , who was delivering on their promise to the Jews ? A lot of historians say it certainly was n't the Vatican . And many historians say that FDR could have done more , and many historians say that Winston Churchill could have done more . And I think in that historical perspective there are people at the head of the Israeli government who say , " Well , they 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're gon na do this on our own . " <p> Coleman : We 're talking about something on a different level when you compare it with the Hitler situation and the discrimination toward a particular ethnic group based on superiority issues . Even though the Jews have that experience with Hitler , you have these Muslims who are just as true to their faith , which is evident from their suicide bombings . I just wonder now if we 're fighting on different levels . You 've got more of a faith level . They 're digging in because of their faith , their beliefs on both sides . Is it , then , something that can be resolved ? <p> Rovner : You have the Jewish people who were almost annihilated with the threat of being annihilated again . <p> Richie : The imagery that I took away from this book was overwhelming on so many levels . I thought about the kids . I did n't really think about the conflict . But I thought about the kids on both sides who are embroiled . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an immediate and direct , hard-hitting between-the-eyes lesson from this book , it would be the kids in the Middle East . I do n't know how this conflict is going to be resolved because both sides are so vested and adamant about their positions . <p> Chico : I do n't mean to simplify this at all , but there seem to be solutions to the problem . It seems like people want to throw up their hands and say it 's Arab vs . Jew . It 's unsolvable . I 'll never understand terrorism as a means to an end . I think it 's right on par with what I see in this book . I think it 's inhumane and it 's just not conscionable . <p> Richie : And I think Elie and his life experience would be a lesson , because ultimately , as the problems get solved , the young people are going to have to take on the peace when it comes and they 're going to have to embrace it and articulate it and become the spokespeople that that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art approximate experience ? <p> Rovner : I think Wiesel , Anne Frank , Andre Schwarz-Bart , who wrote The Last of the Just in 1959  --  they are artists of the highest order in speaking the truth and in holding sacred the past regardless of how ghastly the past may have been . And I do think that this is one of those books that transcends literature and it transcends reality and I think that it is absolutely art in the same way that Michelangelo is art or Beethoven is art . <p> Coleman : I just kept saying to myself , " He was there . He was there . " Last month , I watched both " Amistad " and " Roots " with my son ... and those are all these little pieced-together stories , and it 's pretty horrific when you see all those people packed in on the boat . But they were n't there . <p> Richie : I turned each page with the sense that each vignette was careful , methodical and immediate . There was not a lot of laboring over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted good and then it tasted like corpses , it gets on a level that books that write volumes ca n't speak to . <p> Burke : He does n't editorialize and he does n't try to opinionate . It is just the facts . " This is how it happened . " <p> Rovner : He himself said that he tells it so quickly and in such short staccato sentences because that was the way one had to deal in the ghetto , in the concentration camps . Quickly , quickly . Everything had to be fast and quick and short and careful . <p> Have we become desensitized to the Holocaust ? <p> Rovner : The shock is not there anymore . At first it was so shocking that no one wanted to hear or read or see or know or think about it . <p> Coleman : Could that have been because of the time period , because it was still so close ? " Amistad " was not the big hit that people thought it would be . And I 'm just wondering , as time goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dilute it . <p> Chico : As evidence of that , genocide continues to take place . I 'm shocked when you see what happened in Kosovo . Thank God the world powers got together and did something about it  --  later than we would like , but nevertheless stepped in . And you know what strikes me ? In Africa nobody interceded . <p> Richie : And we read very little about it . <p> Chico : There 's still a very very large question on the table . Obviously Elie Wiesel chronicles very vividly here what happened . But the question in my mind remains , Had Pearl Harbor not taken place , how much longer would it have been before the United States joined the Allies to do something about the Nazi genocide ? We were late in Kosovo , we never arrived in Africa . Sometimes we never answer the phone , and I think that 's a very , very large question . <p> Rovner : I was so taken with Wiesel 's acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize that I have it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , there 's much that can be done . One person of integrity can make a difference , a difference between life and death . As long as one dissident is imprisoned , our freedom will not be true . As long as one child is hungry , our lives will be filled with anguish and shame . What all these victims need above all is to know that they are not alone , that we are not forgetting them , that when their voices are stilled we shall lend them ours , that while their freedom depends on ours , the quality of our freedom depends on theirs . " <p> That says it all , does n't it ?
