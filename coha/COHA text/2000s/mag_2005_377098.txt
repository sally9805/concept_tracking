Even as the Iraq war has dragged on , offering no foreseeable end , top Pentagon officials have maintained that the nation 's Army is fit enough and big enough to fight it . But last week the military 's taut tendons  --  at the breaking point for better than a year  --  could be heard painfully snapping from the Pentagon to the Sunni triangle . First came a warning from the head of the Army Reserve that those troops are " rapidly degenerating into a broken force . " Then Army officials , speaking privately , conceded that a long-standing policy limiting deployments of National Guard and Army Reserve forces is likely to be scrapped . That 's going to make the already difficult job of recruiting  --  and retaining  --  such part-time soldiers even tougher . Finally , they added , the continuing instability in Iraq will probably force the Army to make permanent what was supposed to be a temporary addition of 30,000 troops to the active-duty force . <P> Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  --  who has long opposed a permanent hike in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling indicators surfaced . The Defense chief has argued that retooling the Army  --  turning cooks and accountants into trigger pullers and hiring contractors to perform such civilian tasks , among other steps  --  should generate efficiencies that would ease the strain on the Army without having to boost its size . But other Pentagon officials doubt that such measures will suffice . " We 're growing increasingly concerned about the health of the force , " an Army personnel officer says . " These deployments are really beginning to take a toll . " <P> Outside observers agree . " The Army 's wheels are going to come off in the next 24 months , " Barry McCaffrey , a retired four-star Army general , said last week . " The data are now beginning to come in to support that . " McCaffrey said the service needs to add 80,000 troops to ease the strain brought on by the Iraq war . " We are in a period of considerable strategic peril , " he said . " And it 's because Rumsfeld has dug in his heels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " <P> Because of other commitments overseas , in Europe and Eastern Asia , and because the Pentagon is trying to limit Iraq tours to a year , the Army increasingly has had to rely on the National Guard and Army Reserve to help fill the roster of 150,000 troops in Iraq . Those part-time forces represent 40% of the current U.S. troop strength in Iraq and will grow to 50% in coming months . There were about 160,000 National Guard and Army reservists on active duty last week , including 60,000 inside Iraq . In a Dec. 20 memo published in the Baltimore Sun last week , Lieut . General James Helmly , chief of the Army Reserve , warned that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have put in " grave danger " his force 's ability to fulfill other Pentagon missions or help grapple with domestic emergencies . " I do not wish to sound alarmist , " wrote Helmly , who won a Bronze Star for valor in Vietnam . " I do wish to send a clear , distinctive signal of deepening concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  those who praised Helmly 's candor and courage , and those who found the memo 's tone , and its appearance in a newspaper , a little too self-promoting.
