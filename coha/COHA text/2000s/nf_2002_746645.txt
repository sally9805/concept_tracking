Learning scientific Information Historical examination <p> Earlier international comparisons of scientific performance by students at higher-grade levels from various countries have indicated surprisingly low levels of achievement by United States students . Students ' withdrawal from scientific disciplines continues both at the high school and early college levels . In spite of the varied and additional types of scientific information presently available in this electronic age to students , retreat from scientific careers continues to increase . Several explanations have been proposed for this withdrawal , and searches for new instructional strategies to stop it continue . One aspect of scientific instruction that has been generally neglected , presented here as a possible remedy , is that of emphasizing retention of scientific concepts by students while in the process of performing laboratory activities . This process of retention and learning of scientific concepts is important to students for formulating higher concepts as they advance to explorations of more difficult areas of natural phenomena . <p> In recent times , the main focus in science classrooms has been on mastering science skills and doing science as it is practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 ) . In contrast to older methods of science instruction , which emphasized lectures to efficiently present scientific information and encouraged students to memorize facts from textbooks , examination of today 's scientific instructions quickly reveals an emphasis on problem solving , inquiry- based laboratory activities and the rejection of science as a body of facts that must be memorized ( Stuart &; Henry , 2002 ) . Nowadays , an overall assessment reveals significant advancements in scientific instructional activities ( Ediger , 2001 ; Hammond , 2001 ) . <p> Several strategies have jointly contributed to the overall improvement in today 's scientific instruction . Constructivist teaching methods , in which inquiry-based instructional strategies are emphasized , have received much attention nationally ( Brooks &; Brooks , 1993 ) . These methods , guided by principles of the learning cycle , allow students to explore and develop scientific concepts while completing meaningful activities ( Lawson , 2000 ) . Equally enriching is the use of group discussion sessions for clarifying scientific concepts . In addition , cooperative group activities have provided a positive social stimulus for enhancing these discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defined - Acquiring scientific knowledge <p> However , in spite of these positive developments in science instruction , as indicated by present day statistics , high school and college students continue to perform poorly in scientific disciplines and maintain high rates of failure ( Cavallo &; Laubach , 2000 , Halloun , 1998 ) . International comparisons have revealed low levels of scientific achievement among high school students in the United States ( Mayer &; Kumano , 1999 ) . These results are unacceptable and have continued to force educators to re-examine science curricula in an effort to decrease the rate of exodus from scientific careers ( Archibold , 1999 ; Stake &; Mares , 2001 ) . This retreat from science is in direct response to high failure rates experienced in pre-college and college courses , stemming from a lack of skills for retaining scientific knowledge necessary for acquisition of more advanced concepts by students as they encounter more complex natural phenomena ( Archibold , 1999 ; McCallister , 2002 ) . <p> Today , emphasis in science classes is primarily on completing laboratory activities . However , students must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they should also be guided in the process of learning the scientific information discovered during these laboratory activities . Larger concepts can only be defined when connections between the subconcepts are attained during laboratory investigations . <p> As instructors , we do not spend sufficient time focusing on acquisition and development of scientific vocabulary . Although it is well known that technical concepts must be retained , processed , and stored intellectually if they are to be applied to later explorations of more advanced concepts , students are not given adequate time to acquire new terms and definitions during laboratory and discussion sessions . <p> Unless students are able to master the technical language associated with scientific concepts and retain these concepts as they advance to higher levels of scientific explorations , they will fail to achieve full comprehension of later scientific explorations since mastery of technical language is necessary for acquisition of more complex information ( Eric &; Samford , 1999 ) . Active learning with the help of instructors <p> Instructors can become active participants in the learning process by presenting to students assessment items such as concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of laboratory activities . It is during phases of inquiry-based laboratory activities that students are given the best opportunities to develop and retain scientific information ( Cajas , 2001 ; Warren et al . 2001 ; Hewsen , 1981 ) . During these sessions , not only are students constantly faced with problem-solving situations but they are also provided with opportunities to constantly connect , correct , expand and apply scientific terms and definitions associated with the concepts that are being explored . By applying previously developed scientific concepts to these novel situations , higher constructs develop and opportunities for retaining scientific information arise ( Ausubel , 1968 ; Lawson , 2000 ) . Cooperative group learning and discussion sessions <p> A large part of developing scientific literacy is associated with discussion sessions in cooperative groups ( Johnson et al . 1991 ) . These discussion sessions following laboratory sessions stimulate thought processes arising from earlier exposures to interesting natural phenomena during ( Erick &; Samford , 1999 ) . Interactive presentations that encourage questions from students will often allow them to examine concepts presented and redefine new constructs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Time for making associations between concepts and accommodating new information can be assigned during these discussion sessions which should also include periods for peer questioning . Role of Technology in learning process <p> With the explosive use of technology in today 's science classrooms , including exposures to electronic information , students can expand on their knowledge if they are sufficiently literate . In order to encourage students to develop as autonomous learners , students must be capable of grasping scientific information presented at these electronic sites . They must be taught , through guided instruction , how concepts can be developed and retained ( Palladino , 2002 ) . In science laboratories we commend students for doing science - hypothesizing , planning experiments , collecting and analyzing data - but de-emphasize the value of retaining scientific information , which are derived from these activities ( Carter , 1999 ; Hurd , 1998 ) . Rarely do we allow sufficient time for important links to be developed , links that are essential for the emergence of well-defined constructs . <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
