This man is serious . He has put a map of the Mall in my hands and is now insisting that after meeting with the media at the Washington Monument , the parade/demonstration must be routed to the White House for a final statement . <p> " You 're crazy , " I shout above the other voices , a strategy I learned at Columbia 's democracy salon . " We 'll need two permits . One from the Park Service for the Mall maybe , but the city will never give us one for Pennsylvania Avenue on the same day . Impossible . " <p> Wang shakes his sheen of shoulder-length hair from side to side , practicing for the TV cameras . It glistens in the subdued light of the living room . It 's gorgeous , and its image has already been beamed to every TV set on both sides of the Pacific . Then abruptly he looks straight at me , his seriousness and sincerity focused for the photojournalist 's close-up . <p> " Look , we 're all here . " Wang sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Cat from San Diego . " <p> " We know , we know , " yells someone from the kitchen . " Where he 's been selling Yamaha guitars after his expulsion from Berkeley for lying about his green card . YA-MA-HA . Ha ha , good thing he lives in California . For penance he must offer his Nanjing grandmother oranges every week . " <p> " We must be serious here , " Wang continues , Wang the career organizer , who has put this curious coalition together , COC , Committee of Overseas Chinese , ever watchful of human rights violations in China and always promoting the struggle for democracy in the motherland . <p> But what he says is true , we 're all here , half of Beijing 's leaders ' children all gathered in one room in America , the third brain drain this century  --  Qing from Brandeis who still sleeps with the lights on , Gao holding down a Nieman at Harvard , Liu from CUNY , and even crazy Li from Michigan State . A casually tossed grenade here could seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select someone to make the speech , " that same voice yells from the kitchen . <p> " What about the physicist Fang Lizhi ? " Xiao Liu raises her hand . She is rumored to be dating an American , but she has not yet changed her Beijing-styled bobbed hair . <p> " No , that wo n't work , " Wang answers . " Nobody trusts a physicist , not anymore since Galileo . " <p> " He was n't a physicist , you idiot , " Black Cat shudders . " But I agree with you . Feng 's not very good in front of a camera , in either language , Chinese or English , physics or politics . " <p> Here comes the silence of agreement , the vast stillness of conspiracy hatched some ten years ago in Beijing , before the first gathering in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace in April . <p> " We need someone younger , someone with good teeth , someone who 'll make those mothers in Peoria cry over their TV dinners and send us their checks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever the consensus builder , she has not yet abandoned her role of saying what everyone else in the room is already thinking . <p> " All right , then . What about Wang Dan ? " Someone had to say it , and it is Black Cat . " He 's recognizable , even for America 's short memory . Good in front of cameras , and he sounds convincing with his new dentures . He even mentions those prisoners that have been left behind  --  surely that will wring some hearts for our cause . " <p> " Yeah , but there 's always that rogue reporter out there who 's going to make him slip , even with an interpreter . It happened twice last year , in Milwaukee and in Denver . " Wang sounds very sure of himself  --  he has stopped shaking his hair for this announcement . " He 's going to be our next president ; we ca n't expose him to any negative publicity . " <p> " What about that student who stopped the tanks during the demonstration at Tianamen Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the south who speaks a passable Mandarin but has been accepted because of his success at raising funds from Hong Kong 's motherland candle burners . <p> " You mean Charlie Cole 's Newsweek photo that 's reprinted all over the world a hundred times every June 4 since 1989 ? " Black Cat asks between sucks on his funky cigarette . " I thought everyone knew he did n't stop those tanks of the 38th Army in T-Square ; those four unarmed tanks stopped for him . It is n't just a squabble between interpretations . I thought everyone knew that . Strange that we 've never been able to identify him . Perhaps he was an MSS agent . " <p> " Or he was a student swiftly arrested and imprisoned , " Chen argues . <p> " All right , you two , all right , " Wang intercedes , shaking his hair . " Let 's not fight among ourselves . We still have a lot to decide before meeting with the Park Service tomorrow . " <p> " Hey , let 's order out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 'll get some work done . " <p> Tomorrow : <p> Date : October 10 <p> Time : 9:00 a.m. for staging 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 for parade , up Independence Avenue to Washington Monument <p> Wang , Black Cat , Xiao Liu , and I are at the Park Service office filling out a form for a parade/demonstration permit . We have been here for more than an hour , and are having some problems with these questions . <p> Organization : COC <p> Address : <p> Officers : <p> " Looks like you could do with some friendly assistance with that form , " a woman 's voice drifts to us from the blind side . A ranger with shorter hair than Xiao Liu 's has come to help . <p> " Yes . Thanks , ma'am , " Wang turns around , shaking his hair . <p> " Please do n't ma'am me , " the ranger says . " I 'm here to help , and my name is Dorene Okamura , " she smiles , patting her burnished nameplate over her starched left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend not to know what his look means . Instead I hand Dorene Okamura the form and the Park Service pen . <p> " This is as far as we 've come , " I add . <p> " The Washington Monument , that 's okay , Fifteenth and Constitution , still within the Mall , " Dorene Okamura reads the form . " Let 's see here . Okay so far . Hmmmmm . " <p> Xiao Liu is beaming with admiration . <p> " October 10 . Hmmm . That might be a problem , " Dorene Okamura looks at me . " Another group has also applied for a permit for the same time that day . Perhaps you know ? Human Rights Watch , Human Rights in China , and AI ? " <p> " We did n't know . " It is Wang who answers . <p> Ranger Okamura continues to talk to me , as if my running shoes , baseball hat , and no cloud of tobacco stink encircling me make me less likely to misunderstand her words . <p> " But we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be going up Constitution Avenue . Would you have any problems if the two groups saw each other four blocks apart ? " <p> She is directing the question to me again , but it is Wang who answers , again . <p> " No problem , " he says , in the same tone of voice as if the ranger had just changed her order from a Big Mac to a double cheeseburger . " Who 's their speaker ? " he asks . <p> " I think Were Kaiser , but I 'm not sure . " <p> " Yes , you mean Wu'er Kaixi , that Uighur minority hooligan from Beijing Normal , that exploiter of human tragedy ? I thought he was in Australia or Japan , last I heard . " <p> " Wherever , " Dorene Okamura says . " But they said he 'll be here October 10. 10:45 a.m . The media 's been prompted . My job is to see three things : first that there 'll be no conflict between the two parades ; then ensure the media will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make sure there will be enough Porta Potties for everyone . We also provide the necessary deputized security to make sure these things will happen , and in the right order . " <p> I can tell that Xiao Liu wants to know what a Porta Potti is , but she looks down at the floor tiling instead , suppressing the question for later . <p> " These demonstration plans look pretty controlled and rehearsed to me , " Black Cat speaks for the first time . " Whatever happened to good ol ' spontaneous demonstration ? " <p> " We do n't believe there 's ever been a spontaneous demonstration in human history . " Ranger Okamura looks ready for the cameras . " Not even in front of the Hilton in 1968 Chicago . In Indonesia last year , first a truck shows up with the demonstrators , then a minute later another truck loaded with rocks . They are all planned , some more successfully than others . " <p> " If any of your people plan on being at high places , " she adds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must know where and their names . " <p> The four of us take turns looking at each other and say nothing . <p> The ranger continues . <p> " There 'll be a staging area available to you at nine . " She walks to the wall map and points to a small section off the freeway at the junction of Independence and Third . " Here you can organize your pro-democracy parade . Are you sure you do n't know about the other group ? " She looks straight at Wang , who is busily shaking his hair , which has become his answer to everything he wants to avoid . <p> Black Cat and I exchange looks to say nothing , and it is Xiao Liu who answers the ranger . <p> " Yes , at the staging area we can put on makeup for the cameras . Some powder so our faces wo n't shine under the bright lights . Some lipstick , too . We must look young , energetic , and dedicated to democracy . " <p> The rest of the details are worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose interest in this meeting , so Dorene Okamura is talking directly to Wang instead . <p> Sometime Later : <p> My mind wanders back to the Beijing of ten years ago . We did it wrong back then , and we 're doing it wrong again on this side of the Pacific . It 's now beginning to be doubtful that we 're ever going to survive the messiness of this part of our history . <p> But when the meeting is over , I will drive to the Georgetown Mall to look for just the right shade of Revlon . I will find the exact lipstick that will let everyone in the world know just enough , not too much , and not too little . Maybe a Cappuccino or Natural Nude that wo n't kiss off . So they would have no doubts . So they would continue to believe . <p> <p> By Alex Kuo <p>
