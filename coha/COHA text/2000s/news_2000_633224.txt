<p> He has raised hybrid orchids and ridden Harley-Davidsons . <p> He once slapped one of his own pitchers and publicly chastised an opposing rookie . <p> He was loved by teammates and hated by management . <p> He has been at war with two franchises , estranged for years first from the Boston Red Sox , then from the White Sox . <p> He is the complex Carlton Fisk , who will have to choose between Sox hats Tuesday after likely being selected to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame . <p> Election appears to be a near-certainty , with Fisk the leading holdover candidate from a 1999 class that sent Nolan Ryan , George Brett and Robin Yount through Cooperstown 's doors . Fisk fell 43 votes short of receiving the necessary 75 percent of the vote from the Baseball Writers ' Association of America . Among those eligible for the first time are former relief ace Rich " Goose " Gossage and starting pitcher Jack Morris , who won World Series with three teams . <p> If Fisk does n't make it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even tougher time next winter when Kirby Puckett , Don Mattingly , Dave Stewart , Dave Winfield and Kirk Gibson become eligible . <p> Perhaps afraid to jinx his chances , Fisk refused to discuss his Hall of Fame prospects last week , opting instead to take a vacation in Florida . He also has refused in the past to discuss which team 's hat he will wear on his Hall of Fame plaque . <p> But that appears to be a certainty , too . Fisk will be wearing a Red Sox hat on his bronze bust . And White Sox fans simply will have to understand . <p> Even though his number has been retired at Comiskey Park and he gave instant credibility to the Jerry Reinsdorf-Eddie Einhorn ownership team in 1981 , even though he played longer for the White Sox ( 13 seasons ) than he did for the Red Sox ( 11 ) and set all his longevity records in Chicago , even though he and wife Linda still live in Lockport , Fisk 's heart is in New England . <p> It is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house he was raised in Charlestown , N.H. , where there is a feeling of defiant separation from the rest of the country . Being from New Hampshire also means having a Granite State toughness . <p> " I have that old New England mentality of guarding my emotions well , of not getting all worked up so I 'd be crushed if I did n't get it , " Fisk recently told the Concord ( N.H. ) Monitor about missing the Hall of Fame last year . " But I was disappointed . I feel as though I was as good at my position as the guys ( who made it ) were . " <p> But basking in a baseball spotlight made last summer the best Fisk had spent in years . Being named an honorary captain at the All-Star Game last summer at Fenway Park brought back memories of playing for his hometown team . <p> " Growing up in New England , that 's every boy 's fantasy , to play for the Boston Red Sox , " he said . " This is maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He received a long , emotional standing ovation before that game and also was introduced as one of the top 100 players of the century . So after nearly two decades of separation , Fisk patched things up with his local team , even taking a public-relations job with the title of assistant general manager . <p> He never really has repaired the emotional hurt of his unceremonious release from the White Sox early in the summer of 1993 , never forgotten the constant contract conflicts that marred each Chicago winter . When Fisk 's No. 72 was painted on the loge level at Comiskey Park in 1998 , board chairman Reinsdorf was notably absent  --  at Fisk 's request . <p> Chicago simply will have to understand when it comes time for Fisk to select a Cooperstown cap . <p> You see , Fisk 's career meant more to New England than it did to the Midwest . There was the unforgettable Game 6 of the 1975 World Series , which Fisk won with a 12th-inning home run off the left-field foul pole , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan and late commissioner Bart Giamatti called " the worst moment for Red Sox fans since the team sold Babe Ruth . " <p> Fisk was a true local hero , commuting to Fenway each day from New Hampshire and being unanimously selected American League Rookie of the Year in 1972 . At the time , Fisk lived in Raymond , N.H. , and volunteer firefighter Charles Perkins recalled meeting him . <p> " I went to a chimney fire , and he was right up there on the roof with me , " Perkins told the Monitor . " I was there with the fire department , but he was just a neighbor come to help . " <p> By the time he retired , Fisk had caught a record 2,226 games , hit more home runs than any catcher ( 351 ) , was named to 11 All-Star teams and caught a record 25 innings in one game . He also underwent five knee surgeries and three hand operations . <p> His career made him a respected figure everywhere , except in the Red Sox ' and White Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , Minnesota Twins infielder Ron Coomer fulfilled a dream by playing as Fisk watched from the first-base coaching box . <p> " I did n't think I 'd make it here , but I did think it would be great if it happened because ( Fisk ) is the guy I owe this to , " Coomer said . <p> Coomer met Fisk while growing up in Lockport . Fisk not only helped Coomer with his hitting , he also talked the White Sox into giving him a chance . A neighbor come to help , so to speak . <p> " I would n't have had a job without Carlton , " Coomer said . " Now we 're golfing buddies , and he 's always trying to get into my pocket . " <p> Fisk built an allegiance among the members of his pitching staff , even though he once startled White Sox teammate Greg Hibbard by slapping him on a visit to the mound . <p> When former White Sox Cy Young winner Jack McDowell caught on with the Anaheim Angels , he picked out No. 92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Sox . It was similar to what Fisk did when he switched from No. 27 with the Red Sox to No. 72 with the White Sox . <p> " It 's for Pudge , " said McDowell , who paid his own way into Comiskey Park when the White Sox retired Fisk 's number . <p> Another former White Sox teammate , Robin Ventura , remembered his first days at Comiskey Park in 1989 and 1990 , when Fisk was the clubhouse veteran . <p> " At that time , Pudge was just like the father of everybody , " Ventura said . " He could snap at you , and doing things right was more out of fear of disappointing him . You respected him , but you really did n't want to disappoint him . He had this stature about him , the way he did everything . " <p> The way he did everything was his way , the tough New England way . <p> In 1990 , a brash New York Yankees rookie named Deion Sanders found out the hard way about Fisk 's style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran only 20 feet before he stopped . <p> Two innings later , when Sanders came to bat again , Fisk looked him in the eye and said : " Run the ( bleeping ) ball out , you piece of ( bleep ) . " <p> " There 's a right way and wrong way to play this game , " Fisk said later . " Yankees pinstripes . Yankees pride . Some of those guys are rolling over in their graves looking at this . It offended me , and I 'm playing for the other team . " <p> Fisk played for two teams during his nearly 2 1/2-decade career . In the end , which hat he wears will not be all that important , except perhaps to his family in New England . <p> " All the elements have to be weighed , " Fisk said not long ago . " It 's a combination of personal , emotional and sentimental levels , not just the professional , statistical and longevity angles . <p> " There can be time and games , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements . " <p> A lot of elements for a complex person .
