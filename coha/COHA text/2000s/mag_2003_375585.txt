Family films . That genre usually means either animated features or something about a dog . So it was nice to find a film  --  heck , a franchise  --  with kids who admired their parents and uttered no curse ruder than " Oh , shiitake mushrooms ! " <P> We come to praise Spy Kids and to bury it . Robert Rodriguez says his third installment is the final one . That 's a shame , because the first two were smart , genial family outings , and because the finale is a bit off  --  less a detour than a pothole . <P> In the first Spy Kids we met the superspies ( Antonio Banderas , Carla Gugino ) , who married , retired , had two kids , then went back to work , this time letting Carmen ( Alexa Vega ) and little bro Juni ( Daryl Sabara ) help Dad and Mom save the world . At the end , Carmen intoned the film 's family-values homily : " Spywork , that 's easy . Keeping a family together , that 's difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> With kids who were recognizably kids and a hero dad with a goofy ( i.e. , human ) streak , the movies underlined Rodriguez 's sense of family : both his actual brood ( his wife produces , his cousin Danny Trejo co-stars ) and the local filmmaking community . ( Mike Judge and Richard Linklater , two dons of the Austin movie Mafia , acted in the series . ) <P> But what Rodriguez really wants to do is entertain , using sight gags , computer sorcery , fast farce and funny town names ( San Diablo ! ) . A pinwheel of inexhaustible ingenuity , he had the kids in the first film pursued by an army of giant thumbs ( " I snap my fingers , " says a nutty TV clown , " and my fingers snap you " ) , and in the second one swordfighting a pirate band of Ray Harryhausen skeletons . Here were terrific adventures that paid homage to old films while they extended the art . <P> Spy Kids 3-D : Game Over has a frenzy of invention too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget  --  save the world ? But its visual thrills are chilly and wearying compared with the other films ' quirky humanity . It 's not a megamovie ; it 's a Sega movie . The parents just about disappear . ( Has any top-billed star spent less time onscreen than Banderas does here ? ) As for the 3-D glasses : now you know why that ' 50s fad ended so quickly . <P> Game Over may be this one-man film studio 's autobiography : a glimpse into the virtual heart of the computer nerd who spun so much Spy Kids fun . Now if he could just crawl out of his labyrinth and give us a brighter , warmer Spy Kids 4 . In 2-D , please .  --  R.C.
