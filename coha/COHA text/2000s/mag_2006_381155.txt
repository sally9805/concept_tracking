It may be time to retire Caspar David Friedrich 's The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog from further use on a book cover . Lovely as it is , this painting has done enough time as shorthand for a sentiment along the lines of " Man is so small , the world about him so vast , gaze on it with me , wo n't you ? " Then again , sometimes exactly that sentiment is called for . Such is the case with Jason Roberts ' A Sense of the World ( HarperCollins ; 382 pages ) , an enthralling biography of a man you 've never heard of named James Holman . <P> Holman was a prodigiously restless world traveler in the early 19th century , a time before Ambien and JetBlue when the world was a dangerous , miserably uncomfortable place to travel . He circled the earth , traversed Siberia , roamed the Australian outback and the Brazilian rain forest , climbed Vesuvius during an eruption , hunted elephants in Ceylon and slave ships in the Atlantic and wrote best-selling books about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he was blind . <P> A promising naval officer , Holman lost his sight at age 25 after a mysterious illness . That was , to say the least , a calamity . Braille had not been invented yet . The blind were institutionalized and infantilized , expected to lead celibate lives mooching or begging or doing menial work . None of which appealed to our hero . Seeking a cure ( not only for his blindness but also for agonizing rheumatism ) , he set off alone for southern France . <P> As he traveled , he made a strange discovery : he felt better . Soon he realized he would n't , maybe could n't , stop traveling . He never got his sight back , but when he was on the move he felt different  --  healthy , dignified , whole . " I see things better with my feet , " he said , with characteristic good humor . <P> Holman had a talent for brushing up against interesting people and things  --  literally . He occasionally got into trouble for groping a piece of statuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of any occasion for a rich , satisfying digression . Holman met Franois Huber , a pioneering blind entomologist who , like Holman , had managed to carve out a career despite his disability . He studied bees using a special hinged hive that opened and shut like a book . Holman sailed with William Owen , the brilliant , illegitimate , eccentric naval captain who surveyed the coast of Africa . <P> A Sense of the World is inspiring  --  but in the real way , the way most " inspirational " books are n't . Holman was n't a Fear Factor thrill seeker ; he was a deeply Romantic figure , a man ransacking the globe for peace of mind even as he fled the demons of disappointment and bitterness nipping at his heels . A celebrity in his time , Holman subsided after his death into the darkness in which he lived . He , and readers everywhere , owes Roberts thanks for leading him back into the light .                  @ @ @
