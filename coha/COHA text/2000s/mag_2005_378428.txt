The speed world has a new demon . At this year 's Indianapolis 500 , Danica Patrick , 23 , became the first woman to hold a lead in the race . Winner Dan Wheldon passed her with six laps to go , and she ended up placing fourth . But TV ratings soared , and she has injected new life into the struggling IndyCar circuit . Patrick spoke to TIME 'S Sean Gregory from her Phoenix , Ariz. , home . <P> IS YOUR PHONE RINGING OFF THE HOOK NOW WITH ENDORSEMENT OFFERS ? <P> My phone is n't , but I bet Brent 's is Brent Maurer is her press rep . All I know is that we 're going to do our best to make sure that I 'm not so distracted that I ca n't do my job , which is to drive a race car . Because nobody is going to want to do a story if I do n't do well . We all know the important parts here . <P> YOU WOUND UP FOURTH IN THE INDY 500 AND STILL MADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIS ATTENTION A BIT AWKWARD ? <P> What I 've done  --  forget gender  --  is still a great thing . I almost won the pole the last two races . I have led the last two races , and I 've never really done any oval racing before . Then there 's the fact that the ratings went up so high , which helps all the other teams as well . We 've gotten some interest from so many areas that have n't been interested in Indy cars before . So I think that I 'm deserving of good things . I 'm not going to say exactly what I think I deserve because realistically I 'm just driving a car and doing what I love to do . <P> HAS IT BEEN HARD TO BREAK INTO RACING 'S BOYS ' CLUB ? <P> I 've always been respected , within reason , because of everything I 've done . The real defining moment for me was after a practice during the first week at Indy when I was faster than everybody . Tony Kanaan and Dario Franchitti drove by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . " You can just tell that they were sincere . They respected me completely as a driver , and they know that I 'm somebody they need to beat . <P> YOU POSED FOR FHM MAGAZINE IN A SKIMPY BLACK LEATHER OUTFIT . ANY REGRETS ABOUT THAT ? <P> Not at all . It was an opportunity to find sponsorship , and it opened lots of doors . You have to do what you have to do , within reason and in respect to yourself , but I do n't feel one bit uncomfortable with it . I look at the pictures and I think , The girls are pretty . I had fun . <P> HAS PLAYBOY CALLED ? <P> Um , yeah , I think they have . I would never do that . It 's just a matter of respecting myself . <P> DRIVER ROBBY GORDON HAS SAID HE WOULD N'T RACE AGAINST YOU BECAUSE YOU 'RE SO MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER DRIVERS , GIVING YOU AN ADVANTAGE . WHAT 'S YOUR REACTION ? <P> I do n't really have a reaction . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know , Buddy Rice won with the heaviest car last year at Indy . So I 'm not sure it really matters that much . <P> YOUR FIANCE IS A PHYSICAL THERAPIST YOU MET AFTER YOU HURT YOUR HIP DOING YOGA . YOU DRIVE OVER 200 M.P.H. FOR A LIVING , BUT GET HURT DOING YOGA ? <P> I was trying to compete with everybody on TV at 6 a.m. , and I was still sleeping . So were my muscles . <P> WITH YOUR LONG HAIR TUCKED UNDERNEATH THAT RACING HELMET , HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH HELMET HEAD ?
