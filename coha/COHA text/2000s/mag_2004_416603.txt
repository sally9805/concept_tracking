BEAUTY IS PRECISELY SKIN DEEP IN THE REALM OF EXTREME TATTOOING THAT EDWARD LAMBERT PORTRAYS IN HIS RECENT WORK . HUMAN FLESH IS TREATED LIKE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL CANVAS , RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT MERELY HOLDS YOUR INSIDES IN. // " Show me a man with a tattoo and I 'll show you a man with an interesting past , " Jack London said in 1883 . Evidently , the fiber artist Edward Lambert has met many interesting people overthe past fewyears , while exploring the fleshy world of contemporary tattoo artistry . Along the way , he has created a rich and provocative body of work that needles the viewer with questions about the resurgence of an ancient practice in contemporary life . About a half dozen years ago , Lambert encountered a student who sported tattoos , the veteran University of Georgia art professor explained during an interview at the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Macon , where an exhibition of his figurative , photo-silk-screened textiles was windinguparunin early August.1 From that student , Lambert began to learn about a subculture that he barely knew existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own conferences , Web sites , artisans , master artists and patron saints ( like Sailor Jerry , a maker of classic " flash " or tattoo designs on paper , active from around 1940 to 1970 ) . " I really do find tattoo artists to be extremely intelligent and creative people , with a great repertoire of ideas and imagery , " said Lambert , who thus far has elected not to be tattooed himself . " These people are very , very serious about what they do , even though you ca n't always be serious about the imagery that they 're using . " He pointed to one of his large-scale fabric murals from 1999 , A Tattoo Is Common Man 's Way of Appreciating Art , in which an elaborately tattooed man displays his body art , one hand modestly shading his private parts . Covered with dots , stipples and whorls , his skin looks like an old engraving . " He 's a janitor , I think , " Lambert continued , " and he has thousands of dollars worth of tattooing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No longer is body ink an automatic mark of outsider status , either , according to Lambert . Lately , doctors , lawyers and business executives have joined bikers and ex-cons in wearing what some call the " graffiti of the soul . " Beauty is precisely skin deep in the realm of extreme tattooing that Lambert portrays in his recent work . Human flesh is treated like a three-dimensional canvas , rather than something that merely holds your insides in . Tapestry Back , 2002 , for instance , presents repeated images of colorful , florid designs spilling across the back and shoulders of a shirtless young man , underscoring the physicality of his extravagantly decorated body . Size matters , too . The large dimensions of Lambert 's printed canvases , combined with the specificity of the photographic images he uses , make for a visceral impact . It is hard to forget that one is looking at designs pricked into people 's skins with sharp needles . Lambert frequently heightens the effect by juxtaposing figurative images with backgrounds consisting of details of enlarged swaths of tattooed flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 . The iconic figure of a man posed like Christin a Renaissance painting-but tattooed from neck to ankles-blends seam lessly into the psychedelic swirls of the magnified epidermis in the background . Lambert 's visual point could hardly be clearer . Human hide is treated like fabric , be it tapestry , toile or old lace . Many of the photographs that serve as the building blocks of Lambert 's compositions were taken by Bobby Hansson , an artist , a freelance photographer and fellow fan of tattoo culture . Others Lambert takes himself . Regardless of the source , most are altered quite a bit on the computer . Normally , after creating his screens , Lambert constructs his collage-like prints by workingfrom foreground to back , a process he likens to paintingon glass . He prints the front images first , then dries and masks them before applying others that will be perceived as further back by the viewer . The resultingfabric murals give the appearance of layering , even though most of the individually printed images are a single layer thick , referencing cloth production rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textile artist , my way of learning about things is through repetition and pattern . I understand things by seeing them over and over , " Lambert said . This approach is employed par excellence in the monumental composition Contorted , Distorted , Reported , 1999 . Bands of nearly nude tattooed bodies alternate in a complex figurai counterpoint , interlocking both horizontally and vertically , flip-flopping from front to back views . The muted color scheme of dark blues , browns and grays is punctuated by strategically placed shots of Chinese red . Subliminally , this rhythmic composition might remind viewers of another meaning of the word tattoo-a military drumbeat or continuous rappingsound. // All Edward Lambert fabric murals shown here are screen prints on canvas .

In the mid-1990s , however , his artistic antenna turned in the direction of the here and now . Lambert became involved in a collaborative project spearheaded by the West Coast artist MeI Chin that was pivotal for his own work . Students and faculty from both the University of Georgia and California Institute of the Arts created set decorations for the prime-time TV soap opera/Me/rose Place , known for its slick glamour . The artists conjured up a variety of rather subversive home furnishings , including a set of screen-printed bed linens called Safety Sheets , cozily bordered with condoms . These pointed , even preachy objects nonetheless helped Lambert appreciate the possibilities of art that comments directly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigued by the weird stuff he found in their pages . Whole bodies of knowledge from beyond the Groves of Academe called out to him : pro wrestling ! Fergie 's marital difficulties ! Dennis Rodman 's latest fashion statement ! Though he professed to know little about these subjects in the beginning , Lambert found his students well versed in the details . Sometimes , he literally ripped the head lines out of newspapers in order to interpolate them into his increasingly topical compositions . He produced portraits of entertainers , such as Michael Jackson and Madonna , that channeled the spirit of Andy Warhol 's silk-screened celebrity icons of the 19605 , and made funhouse-mirror images of the cartoonish world of professional wrestling . Lambert also realized that the digital-imaging techniques he 'd been exploring since the mid-1980s were well suited to his growing interest in the recontextualization of visual data from popular culture . " With the use of the computer and the photo screen process , I can amplify , distort , repeat or manipulate images until I am able to understand these cultural phenomena , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a 1997 artist 's statement.2 The thrust of Lambert 's most recent work has been to delve more deeply into the motivations of the people who make and wear tattoos . Some individuals appear to want merely to transform their skin into portable art galleries-Lambert has run across people decorated with everything from an entire Drer print to interlace patterns derived from the Book of KeIIs . Others are taken with the primal romance of tattooing . Many ancient societies had traditions ofindelibly inked bodyart . Egyptian , Aztecand Polynesian **50;2186;TOOLONG religious , affiliational and protective purposes . Interestingly , the motivations of today 's body art aficionados may not be so different from those of their tribal forebears . According to a Harris Poll conducted in 2003 , people who wear tattoos indicated they feel sexier and more rebellious , attractive and spiritual than individuals without such markings , although not , it should be noted , more intelligent.3 The beatific youngman pictured in **26;2238;TOOLONG , 2001 , would probably agree thathis tattoos express spiritual yearnings . Em blazoned on his chest-in the shape of a tau cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern derived from Chinese calligraphy . A small portion of the pattern repeats , like a flag , on his forehead . His timeless , transfixed appearance is underscored by the frozen presence of an Egyptian statue , similarly associated with the desire for eternal life . Whatever their reasons for decorating their bodies so radically , the people portrayed in Edward Lambert 's textiles have one thing in com mon : for them , h u man skin is the ultimate social fabric . Pliant and absorbent , it has become a canvas for self-expression not very different from the textile artist 's medium . Reference 1 .
