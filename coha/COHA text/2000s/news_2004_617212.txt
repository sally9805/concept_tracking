<p> Janice Liddell could be describing a romance when she talks about her relationship with the ballot box and the Democratic Party . <p> At first she resisted getting involved . When she finally relented , she was filled with excitement and passion . Now , 28 years later , she is committed and comfortable . <p> A self-described " radical " who tried to dress the part with a big Afro and a lot of fringed suede , Liddell , 55 , spent her college years on the edges of the Black Panther movement . She did n't trust the political system , and she never voted . <p> That changed in 1976 , when her father , a Toledo , Ohio , barber who had marched on Washington with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , told her he believed in a candidate named Jimmy Carter . She cast her first ballot that year in Ann Arbor , Mich. , where she was a graduate student . She remembers thinking , " My vote is going to help elect the president . " <p> She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a pattern that places her , along with her African-American sisters , at the core of the party 's constituency . Studies of voting patterns show that black women are the most loyal Democrats of any demographic group . <p> " I think what the Democrats represent is much more in keeping with what black folks want in this country , " said Liddell , a playwright and director of the center for faculty development at Clark Atlanta University . <p> Mary Parker , 76 , a retired cafeteria worker in Reynolds , a town surrounded by cotton fields in rural Middle Georgia , puts it more plainly : " It looks to me like the Democrats always treat colored people better than the Republicans . " <p> Their enthusiasm  --  and that of other black women  --  for the party nominee could determine the next occupant of the Oval Office . <p> In Georgia 's 2000 Democratic presidential primary , 31 percent of the voters were black women  --  the highest percentage of any group . And in the 2000 general election , 94 percent of African-American female voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for Al Gore , according to an analysis by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies , a Washington-based African-American think tank . <p> Difference makers <p> In some important states , African-American women made the difference for the Democrats in 2000 , said Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich , an author , political consultant and former deputy mayor of Philadelphia . In Illinois , the white vote split almost evenly between Gore and George W. Bush , she said , but the 10 percent of voters who were black women pushed Gore over the top with 54 percent . <p> Black women not only tend to vote Democratic , but those who are the organizers in their churches and neighborhoods also volunteer in voter registration drives , pass out campaign literature and get people to the polls on Election Day . <p> That means they can deliver not only their own votes , but those of others . <p> " The challenge to the Democratic Party , " said Scruggs-Leftwich , " is to keep these women committed . " <p> Republicans say they would like to attract more African-American women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic base . They are slowly making inroads , said Scott Rials , executive director of the Georgia GOP . <p> Black women " have the same problems as everybody else , " he said . " You have to appeal to them around the kitchen table , through issues like jobs , health care and education . You have to have a total package . " <p> Doug Heyl , an Atlanta-based Democratic political consultant , agrees that real-life issues are the way to black women 's votes . He , of course , thinks Democratic front-runner Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and runner-up Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina are better equipped to meet their needs than President Bush . <p> " African-American women are looking for candidates who understand everyday people 's lives , " he said . " A campaign 's job is to say , ' I understand your lives , your hopes , your dreams . ' I think the Kerry and Edwards campaigns are doing that effectively . " <p> Joyce Turner , 45 , a computer instructor at DeKalb Technical College , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education before casting her vote in Georgia 's March 2 presidential primary . <p> She 's a Chicago native and lifelong Democrat who says she thinks Democrats are more attuned to the needs of women and families than Republicans . <p> " I have children , " she said . " When I vote , I 'm not just voting for myself . I 'm voting for their future . " <p> Demographics of the black community affect both turnout and voter agendas , said David Bositis , a researcher with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies . <p> One reason for higher participation among black women than black men is that a greater percentage of black men  --  more than 20 percent in some Southern states  --  are convicted felons and have lost their right to vote , he said . His claim is supported by a 1998 study by the Sentencing Project , an advocacy organization for prisoners ' rights , and Human Rights Watch , an organization that monitors human rights internationally . <p> The high percentage of single women raising children makes issues such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People talk about the Democrats being the Mommy Party and the Republicans being the Daddy Party , " he said . " The Democratic Party does emphasize domestic issues such as health care , education and child care . Those are issues that women are more concerned about than men . " <p> Young are n't so loyal <p> Some of the commitment to the Democrats is historical . African-American voters , once loyal to the party of Lincoln , began favoring Democrats during Franklin D. Roosevelt 's administrations . That trend was reinforced when Democrats pushed through civil rights legislation in the 1960s . <p> Marianne Clarke , 64 , an Atlanta media consultant and retired Columbia University professor , recalls casting her first vote for John F. Kennedy . <p> " I was awed with Kennedy and with Jackie , " she said . " He brought in a whole new generation of voters . " <p> Hattye Brown , 83 , a retired teacher and school administrator in Taylor County , recalls hearing about poll taxes and literacy tests that kept many African-Americans from voting . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I always like to vote for the Democrat , " she said . " I do n't think anybody could change my mind . " <p> Younger black women may not be so loyal . The civil rights movement seems long past to young women who are doing well professionally and financially . <p> " There definitely is emerging a more independent mind-set among young black women , " said Felicia Davis of Jonesboro , a member of the advisory board of the Black Women 's Roundtable , a national project that encourages participation in the political process . <p> Images of Condoleezza Rice , a black woman who serves as national security adviser to a Republican president , do n't " go past young black women , " she said . <p> Davis describes herself as a " progressive Republican " but said she voted " very much as an independent . " She is raising a very active and independent-minded daughter who started a club called Future Voters of America . <p> " From what I 've heard , African-American women feel as if the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Wilhite , 44 , of Canton , who was raised by Democrats in Chicago but is a Republican . " That 's not what I 've experienced . I 've had the opportunity to be heard . " <p> Wilhite , who coordinates a faith-based community development organization , said she thought African-American women  --  who she said had " been led down the Democratic road for so long "  --  were becoming more open to alternatives . <p> Scruggs-Leftwich , a Democratic voter whose mother was secretary of the New York State Republican Convention , said , " It 's almost as if the pendulum is swinging back . " <p> Older women are remaining with the Democratic Party , she said , " but I am not seeing their ranks being backfilled by young African-American women . . . . Many of them are identifying themselves as independent . " <p> Shon Payton , 30 , a DeKalb County state employee , said she based her vote on the candidate , not party affiliation . " Who is going to benefit me to have in office ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a housekeeper and laundress at a Jonesboro nursing home , voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 . She 'll vote this year , but has not decided for whom . <p> " I always feel like my vote is the one that makes a difference , " she said . <p> To boost their chances in November , Democrats need to lock in as many votes of black women as possible . <p> " What they need to do is hit on issues that speak to black women , " said Jeremy Mayer , author of " Running on Race  --  Racial Politics in Presidential Campaigns , 1960-2000 . " " We are such an evenly divided nation that if one side whips up its troops , it 's going to be very hard to beat . " Based on ballots cast in at the 2000 presidential primaries in Georgia .
