// The classic fireplace , with a blazing fire open to the room , is a traditional symbol of comfort and security . Many people include a fireplace among their " must have " features when planning for their dream home . On a more practical level , an open fireplace is notoriously inefficient as a means of heating a room . Its appetite for air , to keep smoke from the fire going up the chimney instead of out into the room , is what causes the inefficiency . But lots of people , including many who already heat their homes with a woodstove , probably would consider a fireplace instead - if they could find one that would do the job efficiently . The enduring popularity of fireplaces combined with the choice many of us make to use renewable wood heat for our homes has prompted a number of changes in traditional fireplace design that attempt to address the inefficiency problem . To be an effective heater , a fireplace must borrow some of the features perfected by woodstove designers over the last 20 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system to keep them clean ; firebox insulation and internal baffling . An adjustable combustion air supply also is needed to control the burn rate and , therefore , the output of heat . Some fireplaces with all these features are on the market . The quick way to find them is to look for either factory-built fireplaces or fireplace inserts that are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) as meeting the EPA smoke emission standards , which stipulate acceptable concentrations of air polluting emissions from freestanding woodstoves and fireplace inserts . In designing these fireplaces to burn efficiently enough to meet the standards , the manufacturers have produced some beautiful units that also are able to provide significant heat to your home . Here 's what you need to know to sift through the product specifications , sales advice and marketing hype to choose a unit that will match your personal sheating and decor goals . OPEN FIREPLACES Open fireplaces commonly found in North American homes today fit into one of four general structural categories : Conventional masonry . The standard traditional fireplace , this style is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building code rules , without reference to any specific design criteria . It has a deep , squarish firebox that tends to trap radiant heat in the masonry and allow excess air to flush the heat up the chimney . The efficiency of all other fireplaces is compared to this most-common and least-efficient design . Steel heat form . Popularly called heatilators ( after a major manufacturer of this kind of fireplace ) , steel heat forms consist of a firebox and often a heat exchanger around which masonry fireplaces can be built . Some steel heat forms have air circulation chambers , usually with inlets under the firebox at floor level and outlets between the mantel and the ceiling . When equipped with tight-fitting glass doors and a blower to force air from the room through the heat exchanger , these fireplaces can match the heating performance of an antique potbellied stove for short periods of time . But most heat forms are not designed for , and ca n't stand up to , serious heating chores without failing . Commonly , the fireboxes will warp or crack from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open fireplaces can be designed to increase the amount of radiant heat delivered to the room . Fireplace designs by Benjamin Thompson ( aka Count Rumford ) and later , Peter O. Rosin dominate this category . The Rumford design features a tall , shallow firebox with a narrow back and splayed sides to bring the fire forward and reflect more heat into the room . Rosin 's firebox , precast with a bulge in the back , reflects the heat down , towards the fire , and then out into the room . The success of both the Rosin and Rumford designs in directing more radiant heat into the room is apparent to anyone standing in front of one of these fireplaces . But neither design overcomes the problem of heat loss from the flow of air up the chimney . Nevertheless , they 're great options for a rustic weekend cabin . " Zero-clearance " factory-built fireplaces . This style has a multi-layer sheet metal structure and usually , a firebox lined with custom firebricks . Around the firebox is a sealed space through which room air can circulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature . The name " zero clearance " refers to this style 's standard positioning against the combustible wood framing into which these units are built . Tens of thousands have been installed in suburban houses during the past 30 years . They mimic the look of conventional brick fireplaces but cost much less . The heating performance of conventional ' zeros ' is generally poor . Photograph An EPA-certified Energy King Bay 2000 fireplace insert . // FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS All four styles of conventional fireplaces suffer from three inherent problems . Any one of the problems reduces their appeal , but the combined effect make them unsuitable for use in new houses for heating or aesthetics . 1 . High air demand reduces efficiency . This is true even in fireplaces with special features that increase radiant heat to the room or that have air circulation chambers in which room air can be heated . True , a Rumford or Rosin puts out a lot of radiant heat , and true , the air pouring from the outlet grills of a heat form or a factory-built fireplace is very hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room once and then flows right back into the firebox and up the chimney . The uncontrolled flow of excess air through an open fireplace is an efficiency robber . ( See " Forego the Open Fireplace , " Page 92. ) 2 . Open fireplaces demand more air than modern houses leak . To adjust for this situation , either a window must be opened or some other allowance made for the fireplace to get the air it needs to work . The little 4- or 6-inch-diameter ducts often installed to provide outside air to fireplaces for combustion are far too small to supply even a fraction of what is necessary . So without that open window , even a fireplace with an outside air duct will be smoky and fussy to operate , as many users can attest . But obviously , no practical heating system in a cold climate could depend on an open window for proper functioning . 3 . Unless conditions are perfect , smoke spills into the room . The absence of a barrier between the fire and the room means that smoke can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem called " spillage . " The small currents of air from people moving around in the room and pressure changes at the top of the chimney caused by wind are enough to trigger such spills . Many people are unaware that the pleasant , woodsy smell of fireplace smoke is a health hazard and that even slight smoke spillage should be unacceptable inside a house . STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT Add glass doors ( to reduce excess air flow ) to all the open fireplaces above and you can increase their net efficiency to some extent . In the case of masonry fireplaces , glass doors allow some of the heat from the fire to soak into the masonry for slow release into the room . In the case of fireplaces with air circulation chambers , glass doors can boost internal temperatures , increasing heat transfer to the circulating air . The majority of glass fireplace doors , however , are not tight-fitting , so they reduce air flow only by about half . The tempered-glass panels also block most of the heat from getting into the room and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating , making them unsuitable if you want large , continuous fires to produce heat for your home . So , while tempered-glass doors can boost efficiency by reducing excess airflow , they also reduce radiant heating efficiency and that is why they do n't tend to produce a large net increase in fireplace efficiency . Some fireplace doors use a ceramic glass like that used in woodstoves . It 's a type of glass that permits much of the radiant heat to pass through and has the added benefit of far greater heat resistance than tempered glass . The drawback is that it is significantly more expensive .

The tighter they fit , the quicker they 'd soot up , too . Having to clean the glass after every evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a thick haze would form long before your evening had passed , spoiling your view of the fire . If you already have a conventional open fireplace , you will find a fireplace insert is a far better upgrade option than glass doors . Inserts are woodstoves adapted by their manufacturers to fit within the hearth of an existing fireplace . They are EPA-certified , so they have all the features of " the perfect fireplace " ( read on ) . If you decide to get an insert , be sure to tell the installer you want a full stainless steel liner on the top of the chimney ; full liners improve heating performance and keep maintenance costs to a minimum . THE PERFECT FIREPLACE For new homes and additions , a good selection of beautiful , efficient and convenient factory-built fireplaces is available . Here 's what you should look for if you want a fireplace that will warm your home as well as your heart . 1 . The firebox must roughly match the size of fire that most of us build . That means it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning in conventional fireplaces and you 'll see that they occupy , at most , a third of the hearth opening . 2 . The door glass must be ceramic and the fireplace must have a " glass airwash " system . In such a system , preheated combustion air is released through a narrow slot just above and behind the glass . A good airwash system can keep the glass clear for a week or more of round-the-clock heating . 3 . The door must be gasketed and the fireplace must have a combustion air control . The combustion air control allows you to adjust the firing rate of the fireplace ; any fireplace with a controllable firing rate also must have a combustion system to convert the smoke from slow-burning wood into usable heat . Just as with woodstoves ( see " Woodstove Buyer 's guide , " December/January 2002 ) , two options exist : A catalytic combustor can be built into the fireplace to burn off the smoke before it exits the firebox . Or , alternatively , the fireplace must have an insulated firebox , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support flaming combustion at the top of the firebox . Either a catalytic combustor or an insulated firebox , baffle and air tubes must be in place if the fireplace is to perform to an acceptable level for home heating . Although fireplaces are exempt from the EPA emission limits that all woodstoves must meet , some are engineered to achieve low emissions so they appeal to those of us who have an environmental conscience , and a desire for renewable , wood heat and the beauty of a fire . A by-product of these low-emission technologies is much higher efficiency than conventional fireplaces can achieve . Some of these advanced fireplaces have optional central heating packages with fans and ducts to send the heat throughout the house . Companies that offer these EPA-certified fireplaces are listed on Pages 96 and 97 . OTHER OPTIONS A cheap , inefficient factory-built fireplace , including the chimney , will cost a few thousand dollars to include in a new home , plus some hidden costs from the heated air that goes up the chimney every time you use it . An efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cost twice as much up front , but you will get much of that cost back in fuel-savings over the life of the house . Every time you use a high-efficiency fireplace , your regular heating bill will be reduced . If you use the fireplace often and cut your own firewood , your savings will be even greater . Plus , whenever you heat with wood instead of fossil fuel , you are reducing your household 's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and protecting yourself from the skyrocketing costs of non-renewable energy . If you just want a nice fireplace that makes heat , but you do n't plan to use it for day-to-day home heating , you should explore another category of fireplaces that we 'll call " low emission , EPA exempt . " These units have glass doors with airwash and a reasonably effective combustion system . They do n't have an adjustable air control ; heat output is adjusted by the size of the fire you build . An all-masonry alternative to these clean-burning , factory-built fireplaces is a masonry heater . As the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a stunning centerpiece for a new home through the use of brick , stone or adobe outer shells . Masonry heaters are designed to burn wood quickly and store the heat in their massive structures for slow release in the following hours . One fire a day in cool weather and two fires a day in cold weather are all it takes to keep a reasonably well-insulated house warm and comfortable . // The ideal high-efficiency fireplace is EPA-certified and will likely include a small firebox ; gasketed , ceramic doors ; an airwash system ; low-emission technology ; and airflow control . // In the case of factory-built fireplaces , the EPA-certified types can cost two to three times as much as conventional fireplaces , but conventional types have hidden costs in higher heating bills . You pay more upfront for a high-efficiency fireplace , but that cost can be recovered over time , your furnace will last longer and , especially if you cut your own firewood , the cost for the fuel ( wood ) will be less .

An open hearth may seem inviting ( and ol ' Rover may like to warm his bones next to a blazing fire ) , but open fireplaces are dramatically inefficient at space heating , encourage cold drafts and have a ravenous appetite for fuel . Sidebar Forego the Open Fireplace An open fireplace ca n't heat a home even though a big fire burning in it releases more than enough energy to do so . The basic problem is that open fireplaces have a huge appetite for air . Despite decades of tinkering by enthusiasts and entrepreneurs to improve performance , these fireplaces are condemned to low efficiency by uncontrolled flows of air . Sidebar To keep smoke from rolling out into the room , a lot of air must flow through the firebox opening and up the chimney . This excess air is an efficiency destroyer . The more air flowing through the fireplace that exceeds the minimum needed for complete combustion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two reasons exist for this : first , all that air dilutes the hot combustion gases , lowering their average temperature ; and second , the large resulting volume of excess air and exhaust gas must rush through the fireplace and chimney , leaving little time to transfer its heat to the structure , making it overall less efficient . Fireplaces consume between 150 and 500 cubic feet per minute ( cfm ) of air , whereas high-effi- ciency woodstoves and EPA-certified fireplaces consume only about 10 to 20 cfm . That huge difference in air demand is why you can easily heat a small home with a woodstove or a high-efficiency fireplace , but not with a conventional fireplace . Open fireplaces consume between 150 and 500 cubic feet per minute ( cfm ) of air , whereas high-efficiency woodstoves and EPA-certified fireplaces consume only about 10 to 20 cfm . Open fireplaces also are firewood guzzlers , going through 20 to 30 pounds of wood per hour . In contrast , an advanced woodstove or high-efficiency fireplace that is busy heating an entire house uses only five to 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The efficiency at which an open fireplace converts firewood into useable heat is somewhere between 10 and 40 percent ( depending on the fireplace 's design ) , which is not great . But that figure does n't account for the effect of the fireplace on the house ; in cold weather , that effect can be dramatic . Consider that the large amount of air consumed by the fireplace first must be heated by another system . Otherwise , the house 's temperature quickly would fall , almost to the outdoor temperature , as cold outdoor replacement air comes in . One study found that when the outdoor temperature is at the freezing point , the net efficiency of a conventional fireplace falls to less than 10 percent . In very cold weather , the overall efficiency of fireplace operation can be negative . In practice , a fire lit in the fireplace would cause the house heating system to work harder to keep the house warm than it would if the fireplace were not burning . This negative efficiency of open fireplaces has rendered them an endangered species in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used because they increase heating costs but not comfort .
