If a juryman be an alien born , this is defect of birth ; if he be a slave or bondman , this is defect of liberty , and he can not be liber et legalis homo . Under the word homo also , though a name common to both sexes , the female is however excluded , propter defectum sexus. 3 Blackstone 's Commentaries 362 <p> <p> With rare exception , English juries under the common law system were solely male and , according to renowned English jurist Sir William Blackstone , excluded women propter defectum sexus , or because of a " defect of sex . " Early American common law , which was born of English common law , excluded women from the jury as well . Unlike women 's suffrage , which was attained nationally in 1920 upon the ratification of the nineteenth amendment , women gained the right to serve on juries on a state-by-state basis , and nowhere was that right more grudgingly granted than in the South . <p> Georgia was among the last five states in the Union to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The privilege of serving was not accorded until 1953 : thirty-seven years after women first practiced law in its courts , thirty-three years after women won the vote nationally , and thirty-three years after women first voted in a state primary or general election . In Georgia , moreover , women did not vote in 1920 after the nineteenth amendment became effective , because state officials invoked a requirement that voters must be registered six months in advance of election day . Though women requested that a special registration be set up so that they could vote , they were refused ; thus , Georgia women could not vote in a presidential election until 1924 . Mississippi was the only other state to exclude women from taking part in the 1920 general election. ( n2 ) Over two decades later , Georgia women , led by state senator Iris Blitch and the Georgia Association for Women Lawyers ( GAWL ) were still waging a struggle for access to jury service. ( n3 ) <p> Georgia and the South were well over one-half century behind other states and regions in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both grand and petit juries had resided in the territory of Wyoming . The privilege of jury service was presumed to accompany the right to vote , which had been granted in 1869 to women in the territory. ( n4 ) The passage of the " Act to Grant to the Women of the Wyoming Territory the Right of Suffrage and to Hold Office " was motivated by a number of factors . Some hoped that the passage of a suffrage statute would lure women of refinement to move to the uncivilized territory , while the sponsoring legislator , William H. Bright , reasoned that if blacks had the vote , his wife and mother should have the right as well. ( n5 ) <p> Although Wyoming 's experiment met with some approval , including accolades sent by telegram to President Ulysses S. Grant from King William of Prussia , the state of Georgia was hardly persuaded to follow suit. ( n6 ) An 1872 article in the Atlanta Constitution dramatically described the " suffering " of husbands and children during a murder trial in Wyoming that deprived them of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At morning the doorways of the courtroom were crowded with disconsolate husbands and children waiting to catch a glimpse of their wives and mothers .. At night they would linger to gaze at the retiring forms that once gladdened their homes and their hearts .. One husband became uncontrollable and asked the Judge to permit his wife to go home and see her children and spend the night once more . But the Judge was inexorable , and the poor husband returned alone to his desolate fireside to indict a withering review of the baneful results of Women 's Rights , which appeared in an evening paper on the following day . " ( n7 ) <p> Not only were husbands and their progeny traumatized by the event , when the court ordered a new trial upon discovering that one juror was not a citizen , the accused pled guilty " rather than go before another chignon jury . " ( n8 ) To make matters even worse , the heady experience of serving on a jury dulled the " charms of home " for these wives and mothers whose " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their heads filled with vain ambitions . " Little wonder , then , that the Georgia newspaper declared itself " agin " women 's rights making such a " topsy turvy of social matters . " ( n9 ) But the Wyoming jury experiment was brief , lasting only from March 1870 to September 1871. ( n10 ) With the replacement of Chief Justice J. H. Howe by a new chief justice who was also " agin " allowing women to serve as jurors , women were once again excluded from jury service. ( n11 ) <p> Less than a decade later , the Supreme Court of the United States in Strauder v. West Virginia confirmed in dicta the authority of the states to exclude women from the jury. ( n12 ) The Strauder court opined that although the fourteenth amendment denied to the states the power to discriminate in jury selection on the basis of race , the Constitution did not proscribe the authority of the states to place other reasonable restrictions on jury service , such as confining the selection to males . <p> Although women remained banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1881 , the U.S. Supreme Court held in Neal v. Delaware that when the fifteenth amendment qualified African-American men as electors , they automatically became eligible to serve on juries . The court 's conclusion was bolstered by " the right secured to the colored man under the fourteenth amendment and the civil rights laws . that he shall not be discriminated against solely on account of his race or color , and it follows that no State law can for that cause alone exclude him from the jury box . " ( n13 ) <p> The language of the fifteenth amendment  --  " the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude "  --  was tracked precisely by the nineteenth amendment , which merely substituted the word " sex " for the phrase " race , color , or previous condition of servitude .

Thus , upon ratification of the nineteenth amendment in 1920 , women became eligible to serve as jurors in only a few states that statutorily qualified as jurors all legal voters , and since enfranchisement was not automatically linked with access to jury service , the battle had to be fought on a state-by-state basis. ( n14 ) <p> Georgia resisted vigorously the concept of a mixed jury , and newspaper editorials lectured its readers that the " uncouth , smoke-filled jury room " was no place for a lady. ( n15 ) The 1870 experiment placing pioneer women on Wyoming juries was in 1929 portrayed in the Georgia press as having imposed a terrible hardship on husbands and fathers who were forced to do housework and care for babies . According to a Wyoming senator , a popular rhyme of that day went : " Baby , oh baby , do n't get in a fury , your mama 's been called on the jury . " ( n16 ) <p> At the same time , there was at least one judge in Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve in his courtroom , because " women have more time than men . " ( n17 ) In 1929 , Justice of the Peace John Dillon sent an officer into the streets of Clarkston with a stack of jury summons , four of which were handed to women . Although all four women asked to be excused from service , Dillon rejected their requests and observed that one would have thought " that they could n't live if they had to serve , or that their homes were threatened with rack and ruin by their absence . " ( n18 ) One of the women , Allie Estes , was selected for a five-juror panel and remained for one day . Her service as a juror was not challenged , and she declared it to be a wonderful experience . " I enjoyed it even if the men did look at me sort of askance , " she asserted. ( n19 ) <p> Burnita Shelton Matthews , who in 1949 became the first woman on the federal trial bench , indignantly expressed the frustration felt by advocates of jury service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Women 's Law Journal : <p> If it be , as Blackstone says , a " defect of sex " that bars women from the jury box , the women claim that the defect lies in the masculine , not the feminine ranks .. As women are dissatisfied with Blackstone 's reasoning , so they are dissatisfied with the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court . That court has decided that a state can not bar colored men from jury service because the debarment would brand them as an inferior class of citizens , and deprive them of the equal protection of the law which is guaranteed by the National Constitution . Since the Constitution guarantees that protection to persons and not merely to negroes , that doctrine should apply to women as well . However , with the curious ability which judges of the male persuasion have manifested to regard women as persons at one time , and not as persons at another , the court in this case said that certain restrictions might legally be put upon jury service  --  such as limiting it to males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations , the Muscogee County delegation introduced in the Georgia House of Representatives an ill-fated bill sponsored by the Georgia League of Women Voters that would have allowed women to serve on a jury . Representative H. Dixon Smith , a supporter of the 1937 bill , evoked a strong image of the stereotypical nagging housewife with his comment that " no member of the legislature will disagree with our contention that as inquisitors , which grand jurors really are , women are far superior to men . " ( n21 ) That same year the Affiliated Democratic Women 's Clubs of Georgia sponsored a jury school for women in Savannah . The club had begun pushing for the extension of jury service to women , and the groundbreaking school was the second to be held in the United States . Designed along the lines of the nation 's first jury school in New York , the topics covered during the one-day seminar included the duties of a juror , how juries were drawn , disqualification of jurors , and basic points of law. ( n22 ) Twenty-one states and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury. ( n23 ) In Georgia , however , the 1930s ended with juries still segregated by gender . <p> A senate special judiciary committee again took up the debate in 1941 when J. B. Park of Greensboro authored a bill that would permit women to sit on Georgia juries . According to eighty-six-year-old Senator Park , a former judge of the Ocmulgee superior court , the opposition consisted of " moss-backed old men who want their women to draw water , hew the wood and stay home all the time . " ( n24 ) Critics of the bill ominously predicted a wave of immorality in the event that a jury could not reach a verdict by nighttime . In response , representatives of several women 's organizations offered the testimony of a former woman juror from North Carolina who pointed out that in her home state , men and women were locked in separate rooms if overnight sequestration was necessary. ( n25 ) Although this obvious solution had been used to separate mixed juries since a murder trial in the territory of Wyoming in 1870 , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forums debating the wisdom of legalizing women jurors. ( n26 ) The lone woman senator , Helen Coxon of Ludowici , voted against the bill , which contained an amendment that would require a woman to make written application to the jury commissioners in order to be included on the jury list . " If women are going to serve on juries , they should serve on an equal basis with men , " reasoned Coxon. ( n27 ) After passing the senate , the bill lost momentum in the house . <p> In 1945 , the state constitution of 1877 was amended to give the legislature the power to require jury service of women " under such regulations as the General Assembly may prescribe . " The constitution failed to inspire the necessary legislation , without which a woman could not legally serve on a jury ; however , two years later several developments converged to breathe renewed life into the women jurors ' movement : Iris Faircloth Blitch of Homerville began her first term as a state senator , and the Georgia Association of Women Lawyers mustered its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in Ballard v. United States ( 1946 ) to conduct a massive campaign to seat women on the state 's juries. ( n28 ) <p> The Ballard decision intentionally excluded women from the panel of grand and petit jurors in the Southern District of California where the trial occurred . Prior to the case , the United States Congress had by statute provided that jurors in a federal court should mirror the qualifications of those of the highest court in the state . Under California law , women were eligible for jury service . In noting that Congress clearly reflected a design to make the jury a representative cross-section of the community , the Court decided that " the purposeful and systematic exclusion of women from the panel in this case was a departure from the scheme of jury selection which Congress adopted . " ( n29 ) <p> In response to the argument that an all-male panel drawn from the various groups within a community would be as representative as if women were included ( because the factors that tend to influence the action of women are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , background , and economic status ) , the Court observed : <p> Yet it is not enough to say that women when sitting as jurors neither act nor tend to act as a class . Men likewise do not act as a class . But if the shoe were on the other foot , who would claim that a jury was truly representative of the community if all men were intentionally and systematically excluded from the panel ? The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible ; a community made up exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both ; the subtle interplay of influence one on the other is among the imponderables . To insulate the courtroom from either may not in a given case make an iota of difference . Yet a flavor , a distinct quality is lost if either sex is excluded . The exclusion of one may indeed make the jury less representative of the community than would be true if an economic or racial group were excluded. ( n30 ) <p> Although the Ballard court never discussed the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , months after the decision was handed down , several women 's organizations met at the Cox-Carlton Hotel in Atlanta to discuss implementing a state-wide dialogue on the subject. ( n31 ) The specter of rampant immorality surfaced once more as the media discussed GAWL 's expectations of opposition from women themselves : " In years past , representatives from the Council of Church Women , among other groups , have appeared to protest women jury service , on the ground that it was of dubious community service and even immoral to be locked up all night on a mixed panel of a hung jury . " That claim was just " medieval " and " Victorian , " scoffed GAWL 's new president , Caroline Pennisi , who pointed out that as assistant counsel for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society , she often saw women 's interests jeopardized due to the exclusion of women from juries , such as in cases where elderly housewives requested an award of alimony from husbands who abandoned them. ( n32 ) <p> Weeks after GAWL met to discuss reviving the twice-killed women jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state senate providing for jury service for women. ( n33 ) Touted as " litigation with the feminine touch , " the senate voted 28 to 20 to approve the bill after a rancorous debate . The opponents argued that the Bible forbade such practices ; that decent women would not want to serve on juries ; that women should be protected from the abhorrent facts that surfaced during some criminal trials ; and that women would have to drag their children to court with them . " Those women who are so anxious to serve on juries do n't raise many children , do they ? " asked Sen. T. S. Mason of Hartwell . " No , " replied Sen. L. T. Mitchell of Clayton , who also opposed the bill , " they drag poodle dogs around . " ( n34 ) <p> The two women in the senate , Iris Blitch and Mrs. Benton Odom , split their votes . Blitch spoke in favor of the bill , noting that if the courts were as uncivilized as the bill 's opponents claimed , women were needed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial system . Odom , of Newton County , echoed the 1941 sentiments of Helen Coxon : if given the privilege to serve , women should be no more exempt from jury service than men . The bill as originally proposed would have permitted jury service under the same terms as specified for men , but had been amended to allow women to decide if they wished to serve. ( n35 ) Everett Millican , author of the bill , indirectly referenced Wyoming legislator William Bright 's argument that women should have the same rights as blacks by noting that women were needed on the jury because the elimination of the poll tax had resulted in " lower class " juries. ( n36 ) Once again , the bill failed to survive passage ; on the last day of the 1947 legislature the house tabled the legislation . President Carolyn Pennisi encouraged GAWL to continue the fight , noting that although the bill " did not go over the top , we could say that it reached the mid-way mark , by getting past the senate . We laid some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( n37 ) That same year , a federal district court judge delivered another setback to supporters of women jurors by ruling that as long as Georgia law excluded women from state court juries , it would be illegal for women to sit on federal grand or petit juries empanelled in the state. ( n38 ) <p> The following year , the Atlanta Constitution reversed course from its 1872 stance " agin " women jurors . Women 's news editor Doris Lockerman described to readers of an Atlanta paper a recent scene from a courtroom in Fulton County , where a woman , nervous and new to the judicial system , had brought suit to recover damages suffered in an automobile accident . Lockerman indignantly quoted the defense lawyer 's argument to the all-male jury : " Gentlemen of the jury , " he smiled insinuatingly at his peers , " you saw this woman on the witness stand ; you saw how nervous she was when she testified . That , gentlemen , is a woman driver ! You know , you 've seen ' em . they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it every time ! " ( n39 ) <p> Lockerman opined that the defense won , of course , because every man on the jury " knew women drivers , " but that few of them knew , or cared about , justice . Lockerman then launched into a description of GAWL 's fight for jury service for women , countered the standard " flaccid and decadent " arguments against women on juries , and declared that justice is everybody 's business. ( n40 ) Several days later an unsigned Atlanta Constitution editorial rifled " Women on Juries ? Well , Why Not ? " maintained that Georgia 's ban against women jurors was an anachronism clung to by a minority of the states , and that it was high time for Georgia to pass legislation enabling women to sit on a jury. ( n41 ) The editorial dismissed the notion that women would bring to the justice system greater integrity , justice , or benevolence than men , but did conclude that women seemed eager to serve , which in itself was an improvement over the attitude of potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar Association reported that a majority of its members approved jury service for women . " It 's all right , girls , Atlanta lawyers would like to see you serve on juries , " chirped the Atlanta Constitution under a headline proclaiming that " Lawyers Favor the Girls . " ( n43 ) <p> Amber Anderson took the reins of GAWL 's jury bill committee in 1948 . At that time , approximately one hundred women practiced law in the state , and most of them were GAWL members. ( n44 ) GAWL , which was backed in its struggle by the Georgia Federation of Women 's Clubs , the Georgia League of Women Voters , and the Georgia Business and Professional Women 's Clubs , vowed to make passage of a women 's jury bill its main objective that year. ( n45 ) To that end , GAWL prepared a pamphlet for statewide distribution tided " Jury Service for Women , " which provided a brief history of women 's jury service and outlined a proposed bill to amend section 59-106 of the Code of Georgia of 1933 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors. ( n46 ) The proffered language would have simply inserted the words " and women " after the word " men " occurred . The pamphlet also set forth the arguments articulated by both sides of the issue , and included a five-point " suggested procedure " for clubs interested in procuring jury service for women . GAWL asked organizations to approve a resolution to support their proposed bill , and provide that endorsement to the organization . It also suggested that club members lobby legislators , prepare educational programs , and discuss the issue with individuals and clubs at every opportunity . The introduction to the pamphlet claimed that jury service was not a right , but a civic duty , and women were ready to assume their obligation to society . Additionally , it quoted passages from the two-year-old Ballard case , which expressed the conviction that an all-male jury could never be sufficiently representative of a community . <p> The " pros " and " cons " debate in the GAWL booklet set forth the usual objections to jury service for women : Georgia 's courthouse facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs associated with appropriately outfitting the buildings were too prohibitive ; women were too delicate to be subjected to the coarse language and facts that must necessarily be addressed during some trials ; very few women wanted to serve ( additionally , the law , if passed , would likely end up making jury service optional , which would make it too expensive and inconvenient for the courts and counties to implement ) ; there were a lack of facilities to keep jurors overnight ; and ( perhaps the most impassioned argument against jury service for women ) it would be disastrous for the country as it would " weaken the Home , " by taking women away from their duties as wives and mothers and " on the Home depends our civilization . " ( n47 ) <p> Indeed , assured one opponent of the proposed bill , drawing mothers away from the home would be " a tragic detriment to our entire spiritual , moral , social , and political structure , " thus resulting in even more " delinquents , criminals and crooks for these same new feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other arguments commonly voiced by foes of " feminine jurors " were that women were too emotional to handle the realities of the courtroom , women would cause distractions with their feminine wiles , and empty-headed women would introduce frivolous chatter into solemn courtroom proceedings. ( n49 ) <p> Countering those arguments , the GAWL brochure noted that since women practiced law , paid taxes , owned property , held office and voted , there was hardly any reason to deny them the opportunity to serve as jurors , which presumably would not require any qualifications beyond those necessary to perform the other roles . The booklet pointed out that female jurors elicited compliments from the judges and attorneys in the thirty-three states that allowed them to serve . <p> One proponent of jury service for women commented that it would hardly " purify jury action " to require women to serve as jurors , however . " From long observation , " she wrote , " I know that women behave much like men once they get into politics . all too often they seem to be enthusiastic about fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " ( n50 ) <p> In 1948 , Amber Anderson published an article in the Georgia Bar Journal covering in more detail the same topics addressed by the brochure , and explained that the qualities required to discharge the duties of a juror  --  to understand the issues , pay careful attention to the evidence , apply that evidence to applicable principles of law , and to maintain intellectual honesty and impartiality  --  were all gender-neutral qualities . Beyond that , she maintained , a female 's viewpoint was needed in all cases , particularly in those cases involving sex offenses , most of which affected girls and women . By then , the endorsements solicited by GAWL through its publication and state-wide distribution of the brochure had begun rolling in , and the article listed seventeen organizations endorsing the movement , including local chapters of the American Association of University Women , the Women 's Chamber of Commerce , and the League of Women Voters. ( n51 ) GAWL 's October 19 , 1948 , bulletin touted Anderson 's efforts ; beyond preparing the pamphlet , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the Georgia Federation of Women 's Clubs and to every weekly newspaper in the state , she had made speeches , contacted newspapers , and " eaten and slept Jury Service for Women for the past year . " ( n52 ) <p> On December 3 , 1948 , the Board of Governors of the Georgia Bar Association unanimously approved the proposed women jurors bill , and noted that since 1947 , when a similar law failed , GAWL had dedicated itself to raising awareness and stimulating public opinion . The board had acted on the favorable recommendation of a special committee composed of five attorneys that included Amber Anderson . Their investigation had shown that a majority of the superior court judges favored putting women on juries. ( n53 ) <p> The following year , Iris Blitch , then Georgia 's only woman legislator , began serving her first term in Georgia 's House of Representatives . She had been a freshman in the Georgia Senate during the 1947-1948 session , but had switched over to the house ostensibly for the color and excitement inherent in that larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her move was " secretly to get her Woman Jury Bill passed " into law . " I 've high hopes of getting that through this time , " Blitch said . " Last time I introduced and the Senate passed a bill providing for jury service for women on a voluntary basis . That was killed in the House . " Blitch , along with the physically handicapped , was given her first choice of seats in the house by speaker Fred Hand of Pelham . " I 'm physically and mentally handicapped , " Rep. Alex Boone of Wilkerson County said coyly . " So is it all right if I sit next to you ? " " Why , certainly , " she replied . " I 'd be glad to keep an eye on you and help you out up here in this gr-reat big place ! " The photograph accompanying this new story featured a seated Blitch surrounded by six smiling men adoringly looming over her ; the cutline noted that Iris Blitch " gets plenty of attention from her colleagues . " ( n54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsurface prejudice " of her colleagues and to surprise with her independent , straightforward speech those " momentarily deceived by her ultra-feminine wardrobe and pretty face . " ( n55 ) By 1949 , only sixteen states banned women from serving as jurors , and Blitch planned to shepherd the bill through the political body that had been its main obstacle in 1947. ( n56 ) <p> Blitch wasted no time . GAWL 's January 27 , 1949 , bulletin contained the news from Amber Anderson that the amended bill , which exempted women with children under sixteen from serving when they asked to be excused , had been introduced in the house on January 24 , and that it had been reported out of committee. ( n57 ) By February 24 , GAWL had to report that the bill had tailed again , defeated by twelve votes after two hours of debate. ( n58 ) Anderson vowed to get a list of representatives voting against the bill so an effort could be made to change their minds , and Blitch promised to introduce the bill again in 1950 . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid for reelection in 1950 . <p> The debate continued , however , and in White County the names of four women were placed on the jury list because , according to the court clerk , the ' Jury revisers decided that if Negroes could serve , so could women . " Attorney General Eugene Cook noted that women were still not eligible to serve as jurors . State law prescribed that jurors be " upright and intelligent men , " and Cook wryly stated that he did not believe the word " men " could mean " women . " However , he explained , if a woman was called for jury duty and no one challenged her at the time of trial , the case could not be appealed on the ground that she was not a legal juror. ( n59 ) <p> The Atlanta Journal quickly polled six lawyers , three of each gender , and they all stated that they were in favor of women jurors . " One  --  male  --  even said he thought women have as much sense as men , " reported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick end when all four women offered duty on the jury asked to be excused . Celestine Sibley disclosed that the reasons given ranged from a bad cold to a previous engagement , but that three of the four admitted to her that their real reason was " fear of masculine resentment . " Only one of the women actually took the jury box ; the other three were excused over the weekend . When Juror No. 4 of Panel 5 , sixty-two-year-old Naomi Lance Allen , took the stand , Judge Edmondson excused her without requesting a reason . Her husband joked that he could not let her serve because then he would have to do all the milking and churning himself ! " ' I would have liked it , ' Mrs. Allen said wistfully . ' I think jury duty is a privilege and a responsibility we women ought to have . But I did n't want to be the first one . ' " ( n61 ) <p> Having temporarily lost its advocate , Iris Blitch , GAWL sponsored a voluntary women jurors bill in 1951 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Habersham County. ( n62 ) GAWL 's January bulletin reminded its members that jurors would be more and more difficult to find as men were called to serve in the Korean War . GAWL had furnished every member of the General Assembly with a copy of the proposed bill and petitioned them to support it as co-authors ; fifteen house members agreed to do so. ( n63 ) Once again , Sen. Everett Millican introduced the bill in the senate and it was referred to the General Judiciary Committee , where it was designated " do not pass " in a fight led by floor leader Grady Rawls. ( n64 ) The house also gave the bill an unfavorable report. ( n65 ) Perhaps GAWL could make better progress if it were a subsidiary organization of the Georgia Bar Association , mused Pearl Burnette , chair of GAWL 's 1951 Jury Bill Committee . It is possible that if the bill had been sponsored by the Georgia Bar Association , of which women attorneys were an integral part , it might have had a better chance of becoming law. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senate proposal fizzled and died in committee. ( n67 ) <p> In April 1951 , a woman finally sat in the juror 's box in Cleveland , Georgia . Mary Ball Tinius served unchallenged as she joined her eleven colleagues in finding the defendant not guilty of manufacturing liquor . Though her name had been placed in the jury box by mistake , the judge decided to let her stay anyway. ( n68 ) Being a juror is the sort of thing that any citizen , " even though a woman , " should do to the best of her ability , she said after the trial. ( n69 ) <p> Voters returned Iris Blitch to the state senate in 1952 . When the new legislature began its work in 1953 , only five states still barred women from juries , and a powerful group had been aligned to champion the goal . In the senate , ranking minority leader G. Everette Millican and president pro tem J. Douglas Carlisle of Macon agreed to join forces to fight for the bill . Rep. Braswell Deen , Jr. , of Alma introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one house member that only " organizationists or poor white trash " wanted to serve on the jury , the house special judiciary committee recommended passage six to one . " You 'll just get poor white trash on the juries , " warned Rep. G. Stuart Watson of Dougherty County . " Then my wife is poor white trash , " retorted another committee member. ( n71 ) <p> On February 23 , 1953 , the house-approved bill hit a snag in the senate when it was tabled on Robert Jordan 's motion , thus precluding debate , and the first session of the 1953 General Assembly ended without any further action. ( n72 ) Jordan , of Talbotton , who had previously expressed his view that the bill would be prohibitively expensive to implement , pointed out that Georgia 's rural courthouses just did not have appropriate restroom facilities for women , and that juries that had to be sequestered would require four bailiffs to watch over them : one for each sex and one for each race . Picking up the racial theme of Jordan 's argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Southern men-folk " that they sit on a jury with black men but were not willing to have white women jurors. ( n73 ) <p> GAWL , the Georgia Federation of Women 's Clubs , the Georgia League of Women Voters , and other advocates swung into high gear as they used the time between sessions to " educate , inundate , and saturate the people of the state with reasons why women should sit on the jury . " ( n74 ) GAWL 's November bulletin urged its members , at the behest of Representative Deen , to persuade at least three women in each district to contact their senator. ( n75 ) The state 's civic leaders held meetings , gave lectures , and generated petitions . Countering their opponents , they offered solutions : if the courthouses were not clean enough for women , then women would bring housekeeping equipment and clean them . If juries had to be sequestered overnight , there were such things as hotels with more than one room . If women were emotional , so were men ; although women may cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of the 1953 legislature convened , the Deen bill was not scheduled for debate in the senate until December 9 , the penultimate day of the session. ( n77 ) Despite a flurry of proposed amendments that would have punched holes in the bill , the women jurors bill passed the senate 30-8 . Gov . Eugene Talmadge signed the legislation on December 21 , his initial misgivings allayed by the optional nature of the law : women could serve if they wished , but if they did not , upon notifying the jury commissions in their home counties they would be permanently excused. ( n78 ) <p> On April 19 , 1954 , Frances Smith , an Atlanta secretary , became the first woman to serve legally on a Georgia jury. ( n79 ) Later that year , voters sent Blitch to the 84th Congress ; she was the third woman from Georgia to serve . Her Eighth District constituents gathered to celebrate a victory dinner for which the women of Clinch County had prepared baskets of food. ( n80 ) There was only one problem : Blitch had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Don " Wheeler , who " hurled the Democrats to regular victories in the annual Congressional baseball game .
