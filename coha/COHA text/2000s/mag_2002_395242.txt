Imagine a tiny Japanese island where you can encounter works by Walter De Maria , Bruce Nauman , Jean-Michel Basquiat and James Turrell  --  just for starters-at any time , day or night , The island is Naoshima , and it is sheltered between two of the main islands , Honshu and Shikoku , in Japan 's Seto Inland Sea , about 500 miles west of Tokyo . There the Benesse Corporation , working with Pritzker Prize-winning architect Tadao Ando , has created a unique environment in which to encounter contemporary art , expanding on such Japanese traditions as harmonizing one 's dwelling space and garden , and creating a site for contemplation , rather like a vast enlargement of the tokonoma , a domestic niche that might contain a scroll and a single flower or bamboo stalk . The Benesse Corporation ( or the Fukutake Publishing Company , as it was once called ) purchased the southern part of Naoshima in 1987 and three years later hired Ando to design a building that would combine a museum and a hotel . Benesse House opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following two years of temporary exhibitions , starting with " Issey Miyake Twist , " the museum began to build a permanent collection . An additional guest residence was constructed in 1995 , and the Art House Project , which brings together architects and artists in a program to rehabilitate some of the island 's derelict vernacular buildings , was inaugurated in 1997 . Late in 2001 , Naoshima organized a 10th-anniversary exhibition . The business that bankrolls this undertaking was founded in 1955 by Tetsuhiko Fukutake , a former teacher who had started a printing company that went bankrupt . Fukutake went on to market correspondence courses and school examination practice tests with great success . In the 1980s and ' ' 90s , his company grew into an international corporation , with over $2 billion in sales for the year 2000 . Besides owning the Berlitz language schools worldwide , Benesse engages in educational publishing and human-services management , overseeing childcare centers and retirement homes . In 1995 Fukutake Publishing was renamed Benesse  --  Latin for " living well " - in order to signal the corporation 's commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have beset Japan since the 1970s . Art was assigned a significant role in that corporate mission , whose declared social agenda sets the Benesse Corporation apart , even in a country where contemporary art has been promoted with substantial business support . Nevertheless , the connection between culture and commerce can look a bit incestuous . For example , Soichiro Fukutake ( who became Benesse 's president at his father 's death in 1986 ) is the museum 's director . Yuji Akimoto , the 47-year-old chief curator , trained as a painter at Tokyo 's National University of Fine Art and , before coming to Naoshima in 1991 , worked as an installation artist , freelance curator and writer . Curators of private Japanese museums need persuasive skills to match their eye for art , and such skills Akimoto clearly possesses . He proposes acquisitions to Fukutake , and ( whether quickly or over a period of years ) he has secured approval , subsequently ratified by the corporate board , for every one . Because its business has largely escaped the economic downturn , the corporation continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Focus of Benesse 's largesse , the 3-square-mile island of Naoshima , with a population of 3,700 , has two small ports , a village and an industrial zone where Mitsubishi has long refined copper . Why did the company choose this venue for its activities instead of Tokyo , say , or Okayama , where Benesse is headquartered ? For one thing , Naoshima has a romantic past : located along important sea routes , the island played home to pirates who built a castle there and whose traces can still be detected . For another , the land forms part of a national park ( its purchase from the Japanese government required an extraordinary dispensation ) and offers dazzling views of water , cliffs , coves , wooded isles and passing vessels . Most important , the journey to Naoshima , coupled with Benesse House 's isolated setting on it , transports visitors away from prevailing urban tempos . This place is about escape but not escapism , about removal , the better to engage . Photograph Above , exterior view of the Benesse House , 2001 .

Ando built Benesse House into a steep hillside , and much of the structure is underground . Still , enough of his signature polished concrete , paired with rough-hewn marble , emerges to create a strong sculptural presence . And while Benesse House burrows in , it also opens onto generous patios , grand staircases , extensive lawns and the sea beyond . Blurring the boundary between inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exterior 's polished concrete planes into the museum and installed massive sliding glass doors to expose the interior to changes in weather , time of day and season . The transition from guest rooms to the museum 's exhibition areas feels almost seamless , and works by the collection 's artists appear in both residence and gallery spaces . Should you , at midnight , say , want a second look at Winston Roeth 's mostly monochrome paintings of 1996 , you have only to go downstairs . Adjacent to the dining room , Ando placed a terrace that faces the water and is flanked by high walls on which hang 14 panoramic photographs ( 1980-97 ) by Hiroshi Sugimoto of seas across the globe . Emphatically framed by the terrace walls , the Inland Sea looks painted , while Sugimoto 's black-and-white photos are so reductive that they evoke abstract paintings . Diners can ponder the idea of " seascape " in two radically different embodiments , each of which appears to be tinged with artifice . From Benesse House a monorail ferries you up to Ando 's second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water flows beneath the pathway and down to the sea below , you emerge into an enclosed oval court with a reflecting pool ringed by entrances to the lodgings . Although the structure sits atop a ridge , the pool , sea-blue walls and vegetation hanging from the roof together convey an underwater impression . Walk into a guest room , however , and your elevated point of view is reestablished : the outer wall is made entirely of glass and opens to an expansive view of sea and islands . Expertly scaled , the architecture balances intimacy with grandeur . Every element has been made with deliberation , attention to craft , and sensitivity to materials and setting . Held up to that level of design achievement , the art holdings themselves occasionally falter . Initially the museum bought mainly postwar American works and formed a conservative collection including good if not brilliant examples by Pollock , Francis , Giacometti , Warhol , Johns , Nevelson , Twombly , Calder , Segal , Bartlett , Haring , Hockney , Long , Judd and others . These name-driven purchases seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accord with the particular character of the place . A couple of three  --  dimensional Stellas from the late ' ' 90s , for instance , make a bold statement , but the early geometric paintings would have better suited Naoshima 's spirit . On the other hand , the core collection established the museum 's credibility in Japan , and its acquisitions policy has grown more self  --  assured and adventurous over time . As it figures out how to more fully inhabit its unique space , the museum has begun to buy younger and less established artists , and more Asian ones , like Shinro Otake , Susumu Kinoshita or Yoshihiro Suda . At the same time , Naoshima is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan , thanks to the Benesse Prize awarded by the corporation since 1995 ( when it spotlighted the company 's name change ) at the Venice Biennale . The prize recognizes the work of younger artists and carries a cash award and commission to create work on the island . The first recipients were Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang , now based in New York ; Alexandros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller , from Canada . The latter may help to fill one notable gap in the expanding collection : video and film . Recent work in those mediums by artists like Bill Viola or Stephen Prina would accord with Naoshima 's contemplative intention . The museum 's most powerful experience comes in the form of a dialogue between Bruce Nauman 's 100 Live and Die ( 1984 ) and Kan Yasuda 's Secret of the Sky ( 1996 ) . Nauman 's installation of 100 small neon signs occupies the gateway to the museum , a huge cylindrical gallery ( its ceiling is 33 feet high ) approached from above by descending a spiral ramp . At the other end of the building , Yasuda 's marble sculptures rest on the floor of a cubic chamber , 30 feet on each side . Nauman 's room is dark , Yasuda 's open to the sky , yet both spaces feel cavelike . Together they anchor the collection conceptually as well as spatially . 100 Live and Die comprises four columns of short phrases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " lack and live , " " suck and die , " " come and live . " Flashing on for a moment each , the sequenced phrases arrest the visitor until the cycle 's end , when they light up all together in a cool , vulgar , cliched , jokey battery of commands that , in this context , ironically echo the corporate mission , By contrast , Secret of the Sky is a pair of low , rounded marble forms ( 2 by 734 by 9 feet ) that evoke cushions or giant raindrops flattened by their fall . The pillowy curves soften the surrounding space 's hard edges , as their natural material plays off the concrete . Despite its stony nature , Yasuda 's sculpture invites visitors to sit and even lie down upon it to study the square patch of changing sky visible above . Outdoor installations , some commissioned for specific sites , extend the art beyond Benesse House . These include works by Kazuo Katase , Karel Appel , George Rickey , Yayoi Kusama and Dan Graham .

In a concrete , Ando-designed alcove facing the sea , De Maria installed twin 9-ton polished granite spheres , each 6 feet in diameter . Like giant eyeballs " with eternal lids apart , " as John Keats would have said , they seem to contemplate " the moving waters ... round earth 's human shores . " These oversized spheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprising three vertical elements sheathed in gold leaf . A five-minute ride by shuttle bus from Benesse House takes you to Honmura , a village of traditional tile-roofed houses with walls of charred cedar . Here the museum has been restoring 200-year-old unoccupied houses-not to create more exhibition space for contemporary art but to blend old structures and new art works into unified environments . The Art House Project entails matching artist and architect with the site , following traditional building techniques and being alert to neighbors ' sensibilities , Three houses are finished ; a fourth , featuring Sugimoto and architect Masaru Kimura , is in progress ; and another is planned . In varying ways , the completed buildings all heighten the visitor 's experience of time . Tatsuo Miyajima 's Sea of Time ( 1998 ) introduces his signature electronic art into the shadowy interior of the house called Kadoya ( Japanese for corner house ) , restored by architect Tadashi Yamamoto . The artist arranged LED counters that display numbers from 1 to 9 in a shallow pool that extends over the house 's entire footprint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timing of the blinking lights , which are colored the red , yellow and green of traffic signals . A different tempo prevails in the second house , Minamidera ( South Temple ) , an Ando/James Turrell collaboration . In a new structure-an exception within the project 's scheme-that recalls the Buddhist Jizoji Temple which occupied the spot until the 1870s , Turrell installed Backside of the Moon ( 1999 ) , the darkest of his " Aperture " series , and the slowest to reveal itself . You enter a room of total blackness , or so it seems until after about 10 minutes , when the outline of a big blue rectangle begins to appear , comes gradually into focus and finally resolves into light emanating indirectly from behind a partition . Minamidera embodies the quintessence of Naoshima , a convergence of Asian and American , old and new , that conspires to slow us down and heighten awareness . Kinza ( 2001 , named for the former occupants ) , by Kimura and Rei Naito , Japan 's representative at the 1997 Venice Biennale , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation Being Given . For a 15-minute period visitors are admitted , one at a time , into a darkened house whose flooring has been removed , The house 's walls stop inches above bare ground , like a skirt , and allow a sliver of natural light to enter . In this tranquil and mysterious space , small objects  --  cylinders , sticks , spheres made of wood , stone , glass or bamboo-seem to appear one by one , even as the installation cunningly suggests that still more objects await discovery . Last year Naoshima expanded its activities beyond Honmura and across the island with " The Standard , " an exhibition marking the museum 's first decade and , in effect , its coming of age . Moving onto the streets and into residences and public buildings , " The Standard " ( the title refers to the values or ethical standards by which we live ) presented Japanese artists exclusively , both well-known and unfamiliar . Certain works were related to their locations , including a fictitious general store by Shigemi Ohtake on the site of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospice patients , again involving LEDs and housed in the former Mitsubishi health clinic . Among the stronger presentations count Tatsumi Orimoto 's record of his mother 's struggle with Alzheimer 's disease . Although lately seen in several exhibitions around the globe , these photographs remain touching , absurd and abject , as she tries to please him and he to remain patient with her . Aging is also the subject of Susumu Kinoshita 's large-scale graphite drawings of a 101-year-old blind woman who is a musician . With Durer-like precision , he zeroes in on her wrinkled hands , ear and neck , seen from behind as she sips tea . The only paintings in " The Standard " are Kyoko Murase 's portrayals of a child in water , her hair draped through tree branches in an Ovidian metamorphosis that blurs distinctions between sleep and death . For next year , Naoshima plans a second edition of " The Standard " that will focus on waste and pollution in the Inland Sea and include installations by Benesse Prize winners . A new Ando building , scheduled to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain a very late Monet water lily painting and large installations by Turrell and De Maria . Ten years on , it is fair to ask how well Benesse has fulfilled its mission . On the credit side , attendance is up ( from 15,000 in 1991 to 30,000 in 2000 and 38,000 in 2001 ) , and visitors come from increasingly distant places to take the 30-minute ferry ride from Okayama . Besides the enhanced tourism , the island benefits from Benesse 's restoration of houses in Honmura . In addition , certain works in the collection raise important social and political issues . On the debit side are some familiar objections to corporate art programs : quality of life arguably might have been better enhanced for the many , rather than the few , with other types of programs ; locating part of Benesse 's business on Naoshima could have helped to retain young people , who now typically seek employment off the island . And of course , the project is n't entirely philanthropic , because the corporation benefits from high-toned PR . As the Benesse Prize suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the corporation has spread its investments across the globe , But such strict ledger-keeping misses the point . To evaluate Benesse 's accomplishments , we need another calculus , one that takes into account quality as well as quantity . We need pockets of resistance like Naoshima , where the deeper existential transformation comes less from social programming than from sheer extraordinary experience . Because of its remoteness and the restricted number of people the guest houses can accommodate , Benesse 's art initiatives on Naoshima may be vulnerable to the charge of elitism , but those very limits are what make possible , albeit for only a few at a time , this brush with a utopian vision . Like a Zen student , the visitor to Naoshima discovers that sometimes beauty is its own truth .
