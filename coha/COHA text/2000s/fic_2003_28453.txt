his linen napkin and scowled across the spotless white tablecloth at his mother . Framed by the tall window behind her , Bettina Bentley was a magnificent sight , as usual . Her blue feathered hat exactly matched the color of her elegant dress and jacket , her hair had been tinted a perfect shade of dark blond , and , with the help of clever makeup , she looked much younger than her fifty-six years . Not that George appreciated the charming picture she made right then . He was too irritated . " George . " His mother breathed his name , leaning forward until her bosom hovered perilously close to her hot fudge sundae . Her coated eyelashes flapped at him in feminine appeal . " I 'm desperate . I promised Jessica you 'd take care of things . Do be a darling . I assure you it will be fun . " Fun ? George almost snorted . He should never have accepted her invitation for dinner , even if Martoni 's was his favorite restaurant . He should have known she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sparkling chandeliers that hung from the ornate ceiling . Dining at Martoni 's was always a pleasant experience . The Italian-style furnishings and decorgave the whole room a festive atmosphere , with colorful floral arrangements and bright paintings of hot , sunlit streets hanging on the peach walls . Elegant - like his mother . Bettina revered elegance to the point of making it a religion . Since the heart attack that had taken his father 's life , he 'd done everything in his power to be there for his mother when she needed him , but sometimes her demands could border on outrageous . He glared at her , more angry at himself than at her . " Mother , you must have a dozen friends who would be only too happy to show Amanda - " " Her name is Amelia . " " - Amelia the sights . After all , Portland is n't exactly New York . It does n't take that long to find your way around . " " I 'm not asking you to show her the city . All cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a beautiful state . I just know the girl would adore a trip to the mountains , the ocean , the gorge , the desert , the wineries .... " She paused to give him the smile she usually reserved for her charity targets . " You are terribly knowledgeable about wine , darling . I 'm sure Amelia would be awfully grateful to learn from you . After all , one can never know enough about good wines , do n't you think ? " " Mother ... " George laid his napkin down at the edge of his empty plate , " I do not have the time or the inclination to play travel guide to that little brat . " Bettina 's perfectly tweezed brows rose a fraction . " How on earth can you say that ? You do n't know anything about her . You ca n't even remember her name , for heaven 's sake . " " We practically grew up together . From what I remember , she took great pleasure in humiliating me . " " Amelia liked to tease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . Besides , that was fifteen years ago . Amelia was just a child then . She 's all grown up now . " " In that case , she does n't need someone to show her around . She 's old enough to take care of herself . I have far better things to do with my time . " The stubborn look he dreaded appeared in Bettina 's blue eyes . " Doing what ? All I can say , George , is that your father would be most disappointed in you . He would have jumped at the chance to help Ben Richard 's daughter . " George could never understand how a woman as tiny as his mother could have such a formidable will . His father had been a giant of a man , towering over his wife , yet had seemed totally incapable of opposing her . No wonder his son was having so much trouble filling his shoes . Afraid he might weaken , he strengthened his resolve . " I 'm far too busy right now . My work - " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bettina wagged a finger at him . " When you 're not there you 're cooped up with no one but a cat to keep you company in that dreadful apartment , doing God knows what - " He straightened . " The apartments at River Park West happen to be some of the nicest in town . " " - when you should be out enjoying yourself with a nice young lady . All you care about is that job and that ridiculous car of yours . " George took time out to swallow the last of his chardonnay . Even so , he could n't quite contain his resentment when he said stiffly , " My Lexus happens to be an excellent car , my job pays my rent and I have all the social activities I can handle . " Bettina uttered a short bark of derision . " Two nights a week at a fitness club ? An occasional night at the theater ? You call that a social life ? You happen to be a very handsome man , George , if I say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room right now who ca n't keep their eyes off you . You have the looks , the money and the time , so why do n't you have girlfriends ? What 's wrong with you ? You 're thirty-two years old , for heaven 's sake . You should be giving me grandchildren . " Her eyes narrowed and she leaned forward again . " You 're not one of them , are you , George ? Surely a son of mine - " George gritted his teeth . " As I 've told you before , many times I might add , I am not gay . You know very well I 've had some very ... healthy relationships in the past . I 'm just not in one now , that 's all . I have n't the time . " " Of course you have the time . I 'll never understand why you ca n't be more like David . At least he joined the navy to see the world . The most you see are the four walls of your apartment . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pang that had hit him at the mention of his younger brother , George muttered darkly , " I spent half my life keeping David out of trouble . That was enough adventure to last me a lifetime . " Bettina studied him with a maternal eye . " What you need is a good woman . At least then you would have sex regularly . Every man needs plenty of sex to stay healthy . " It was time , George decided , that he put an end to this conversation . Discussing his sex life with his mother was low on his list of enjoyable pursuits . " Well , Mother , this has been quite nice , but now I really do have to get back to the office . " " Not until we have this settled . " " It is settled as far as I 'm concerned . Get someone else to keep an eye on the brat . " ( Continues ... )
