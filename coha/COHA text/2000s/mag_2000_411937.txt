I first rode with Troy on my way to lunch , catching up to him as he plodded along on a nondescript mountain bike . At a red light , we did the chat thing-exchanging pleasantries , looking at each other 's bikes . The light turned green and I pedaled off , content-no , proud-to have spent a moment with a fellow cyclist . I 'm a bike racer nut . Troy , as he explained it , relies on his bicycle as his sole source of transportation-riding to work , to the grocery store , to his club meetings . Two wheels get him anywhere and everywhere . He 's a strictly utilitarian cyclist , which got me all sappy- " Wow , we 're such different people yet the simple act of cycling unites us .... " We 're different , alright . The next time I rode up beside Troy I noticed two giant Nazi swastikas on each of his calves . Perfect : My lunch-break riding buddy turns out to be a white supremacist . I still hung to the shreds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclist , right ? Despite our huge differences , we must share something . So we talked-uncomfortably , for me-again at the light . l learned he 'd lost his driver 's license from a rash of run-ins with the law , on top of getting his Chevelle repossessed for " just a few " missed payments . His marriage was failing , and he had n't seen his kids in more than two years . Life is n't easy for Troy , but I kept thinking that he 'd brought much of the hardship upon himself with his racially motivated hatred . Because I 'm white ( " very lucky , " according to Troy ) , he " befriended " me right there at the stoplight . I was n't sure I knew what that meant I was sure I did n't want to know . Another lunch , another light and this time Troy felt comfortable enough to voice his opinioncomplete with gestures-of the many minorities walking past us . I simply rode away . And that was the last time I pedaled along with the creep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I keep wondering about my initial impression that this guy on a bike must be okay just because he 's on a bike . I always believed that - and it 's one of the things I love about our sport Obviously , I was wrong in Troy 's case . So where does that leave me ? I still feel that strange kinship every time I pass a person on a bike-commuters , pros , even the local Mormon patrol squad . Sure , some might not acknowledge your existence when you wave or smile , but most do . Some might be casing your bike to steal it later-who knows ? We 're not going to connect with every rider we meet , but that does n't ruin the sport . I think it 's if you give up faith on every rider you pass that cycling would start to get really lonely . I saw Troy one last time . He was trying to show off by riding a wheelie through a busy intersection with his " White Power " chest tattoo on full display-only to flip over backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to lunch , Andrew Juskaitis , BICYCLING 's test editor , will ride with a different cyclist every month in this space . <p>
