Paris Winter , 1659 She was a creature of mud and dirt , and though from time to time light glinted in her corner of the alley , she did not see it directly . Sometimes the light would catch the edge of her blade and it would startle her , stirring a faint memory . It would stir something around her heart . But it hurt , this remembering , and she would push it away into a dark part of her mind . Instead , she scrabbled for what food she could take from the rats when she could not find a dropped coin , and tried to avoid notice . Occasionally , she received kicks from passersby if she strayed too far from her corner , but the pain from this was only slight , nothing compared to the pain she felt when she saw pain in others . So she closed her eyes and tried to sleep when she was not searching for food . She did not know what day it was , only that light and darkness passed one after another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cold , she was forced from her corner in the alley to the church , where she could sit in a far corner of the sanctuary and look at the light of the candles when she was sure no one was looking . This was more comfortable than the alley , to be sure , and sometimes she would find a piece of bread that someone must have dropped on their way to confession . And . . . it eased the pain in her heart to be there , and she did not bleed from her hands , and her back did not ache when she slept underneath one of the pews . But a church was not for one such as herself . It was on one such cold morning that she awoke to the sound of the priest yawning and opening the sanctuary . She stayed still underneath the pew until she was sure thepriest had passed by , and she crept -- she thought -- noiselessly out the door . " You , boy , stop ! " She looked wildly about her and stared for a moment at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked surprised , then shook his head . " Are you the one who has been sleeping here at night ? " Fear clutched her heart , stopping her voice , but she nodded slightly . " I am sorry , ma Pere , " she managed to whisper after a while . " I will not do so again . " She looked away , fear overcoming her once more , but this time the fear gave her legs motion and she ran . " Wait ! " She would not wait . She knew what waiting would do . Waiting led to a place where she had no way to escape except through more pain . She ran to the alley that was her home , her sheathed blade tapping against her hip , hoping that no one had claimed her corner . But just as the street she followed turned into the alley , she stopped abruptly . Tears began to build beneath her eyelids and she drew in a deep , harsh breath as she looked at the scene before her : a young girl sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man shoved her against the wall and pushed up her skirts . Pain sliced across her back , making her gasp , and her hands prickled with the first flow of blood from them . She pulled out two strips of cloth from her pockets and tied them around her shaking hands . She slowly , carefully pulled out her sword while rage built underneath her ribs , rapidly pulling the air into her lungs . It was the only way . The only way to stop the blood , the pain , and the rage . She ran to the girl and to the men , snarling in her anger and at the almost blinding pain that surged across her back . It was the sound of fury , the sound of a cornered animal . The men turned , and she lashed at them with her sword . " Get away from her . " Her voice was a growl . " Get away , or I will kill you . " She could feel the cloth at the palms of her hands dampen with blood , and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go away -- unless you want some , too . " One man -- short and dark -- sneered and the other , taller , man turned back to the girl , leaned down , and thrust his hand underneath her skirt . The girl screamed . The scream lashed at her , and she jerked as if whipped . She gripped her sword tighter , then her hand lifted and the blade 's tip scored the back of the dark-haired man 's neck . His scream lessened the pain in her hands and he released the girl , putting his hand to his neck and then looking with disbelief at the blood on his fingers . The man 's scream made his friend loosen his hold on the girl ; she fell to her hands and knees , than scrambled out from between the men 's legs . She ran , screaming and weeping , as the taller man tried to hold her by her apron skirts , but her apron came off in his hand . His sneer grew into a frown , then he rushed with a knife at the intruder who had spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked the knife from it . He cried out , and the pain on her back began to fade . She almost let down her guard in relief , but the other man came for her , as well , more cautiously . He , too , had a knife . " Jesu , Marie , " she whispered . She had not ever taken on two men before . She had the advantage of a rapier that was longer than their crude knives , but her pain slowed her , and she knew if she were not swift enough , the strength of these large men would overcome her . She hoped her skill would be enough , as little as it was . The second man circled her , and she could see he was trying to maneuver her so that her back was to his friend . If she could keep both of them in sight -- She turned the other way , but it did no good ; both men had their knives in their hands now , and she was not sure she could deal with both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the alley . It would be possible to run if she needed to , cowardly though it was . The thought of the two men raping another girl made her stomach turn , and the pain across her back increased . No . No , she could not let these men go free . The men lunged as one at her , and she had no choice . She ducked under the arm of one and thrust her rapier , clumsily , at the other . A roar from the man on whom she 'd used her sword told her that she had cut him . She glanced quickly at him and saw that he was clutching his stomach , his clothes showing a spreading blotch of blood . Good . She turned to the other . This man still had his dagger , and now had a large stick in his other hand . She bit back a groan -- the rapier felt heavier to her now , and she had not the rage-induced strength she had long ago before she -- before she . . . She shook her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in the beginning of this fight . She raised her rapier again , flexing her knees as she should , put her other hand behind her back to reduce fatigue , and wished she had learned to fight with a dagger , two-handed . But she had not learned , and her dagger was still strapped to her leg . " Come , cochon , you pig , " she called out . " You can fight me now or later , but either way you will die . Make it quick , so you will not bleed slowly to death like your friend . " She jerked her chin toward the other man , who groaned and vomited blood on the cobblestones . The ruffian looked uncertain , but only for a moment before he rushed at her . She was not so quick this time , and his dagger sliced her arm before she had a chance to move to defend herself . Fatigue washed over her , and she was glad her hands had stopped their bleeding and that the pain in her back had faded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wily and stronger than the other . . . and what was worse , looked more well fed than she . Hunger gripped her stomach at the thought , and her knees trembled . Relief showed in the man 's eyes -- he had seen her trembling . He struck . Again she put up her rapier in defense , and she whipped her blade at him -- too slowly , for she barely escaped another cut of his knife . Blood dripped from her arm and sweat stung her eyes . At least it was not her hands that bled , or her back that stung now . Her arms and legs ached , and the breath wheezed from her lungs . She could not stand much longer , she must fight with all the strength she had left . She swallowed down a sob , and made a desperate lunge . She missed and fell to her knees , her sword rattling on the street from her fatigue-numbed hands . She would die now . It would be a blessed relief . She closed her eyes and waited . And waited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a body hitting the ground . She opened her eyes to see a different man , cleaner , better dressed than the two she had fought , and frighteningly handsome . She looked blearily around her -- the man she had fought was on the ground , a knife sticking out of his throat . " Damned shoddy fighting , " he said . " Bravely done of you , boy , but shoddy . " He spoke French well , but she could hear an accent -- English , she thought . " Not that my method was particularly elegant -- a thrown dagger , you see . " He grinned suddenly . " Fine aim , though , if I do say so myself . " He peered at her , then offered his hand . She could not seem to stand -- her legs would not move . But she would not touch him . She sat , then willed herself to push up to her feet and take a step away from him . The Englishman 's eyebrows rose , but he gave an elegant bow . " Sir John Marstone at your service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kind . She closed her own eyes briefly . It was a long time since she had seen kindness . She remembered her mother had been so before that good lady had died , and had been gentle in her words and her touch . Remembering the kindness made her remember something else , as well . " I . . . merci , monsieur , " she said , and sank into as much of a precise curtsy as she could , though she knew it would never do for a formal curtsy at the king 's court . But this was not the court , or even her . . . home . The Englishman 's brows rose higher . " My name . . . my name --  " A sob escaped her . " My name is Catherine de la Fer . " Pain , old shame , fatigue , and hunger sliced through her , and her sight grew black . " Dieu me sauve , my name is Catherine de la Fer , " she whispered , and fell into darkness . Jack Marstone gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this was inconvenient . It 'd be best if he left this alley ; he 'd hardly want to be caught with two dead bodies should anyone in authority decide to come down this alley . However , if he left the girl here , and said authority found her alive with the two ruffians -- with a bloodied sword , no less -- then she 'd be as good as sentenced and dead . It 'd be a waste of his efforts , and he disliked wasted effort . Then , too , she was a mystery ; he was curious about her , and he rarely resisted his curiosity . He nudged the girl with his boot . " Up , girl , ' t is morning and no time to sleep . Indeed , we need to be awake on the moment if we 're to get away with our skins . " The girl did not move , and Jack grunted in annoyance . God 's blood , it looked like he 'd have to carry the child . . . . The girl looked not much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bent over the still form and felt sticky wetness when he touched her arm . Blood . Worse , the girl was wounded . Jack sat back on his haunches and shook his head . Good intentions were a damned nuisance . Well , there was nothing for it but that he 'd have to take the girl to his lodgings . He 'd patch her up , get some food into her , and send the girl on her way to her mother , with a warning against playing with knives . It was easy to pick her up and carry her over his shoulder -- the child was as light as a feather , her bones easily felt through her clothes . He wrinkled his nose . She also stank . She 'd be better for a washing . If he brought her back to her family in this state , they might just think he was less than a good Samaritan . . . and he intended to be a well-paid Samaritan . Unless she was an actress and trollop and stole the clothes from some patron , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing coarse about her voice , her refined curtsy , or her manner , and that she displayed them even in the midst of extreme circumstances showed that she must be from a noble family . If so , then there had to be money in her return , and he was never behindhand in acquiring funds where he could . The thought of money cheered him , and he whistled a tune between his teeth as he made his way through the narrow alleys to his lodgings . He garnered a few startled looks from passersby , but his rueful grin and response of " He 's as drunk as a louse in a whore 's bed " gave him a few chuckles , as well . His landlady only rolled her eyes at him when he entered the hotel , and he winked at her . " Yes , yes , Madame Felice , yet another one of my charity cases , but this one will bring me into funds , you 'll see . " He jerked his chin toward his room upstairs . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possibly full of vermin . " " And you say this boy will bring you into funds , monsieur ? " The plump landlady wrinkled her nose . " No doubt he will bring fleas into my house , and I will not stand for that ! " Jack grinned . " Aye , the faster the bathwater 's brought up , the better . And it 's a girl , not a boy , possibly run away from her family . " Mme Felice frowned and put her hands on her hips . " En vrai , she will bring you trouble , not money . Her family will not want her if she looks like this . " " True . " Jack hefted the girl more comfortably on his shoulder . " Therefore , I must have the bath . " Mme Felice shook her head and threw her hands up in exasperation , then bustled off as he went up the stairs to his room .
