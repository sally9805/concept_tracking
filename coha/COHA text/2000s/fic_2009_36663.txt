She wished him dead . <p> She knew about him . Witnessed the way his gaze ran lustfully over some preteen girl . Saw how his eyes glued to her athletic limbs and small breasts , how his lips parted and his cock grew hard . <p> But wishing was n't enough . It almost was , but it was n't quite . Sometimes wishing needed a little push . So , she waited for him to go to an unlucky place , the kind of place where bad things happened . Deaths . Accidents . Poisonous secrets . She knew about those places better than anyone because bad things had happened to her at an unlucky place a long time ago , and she 'd spent many formative years getting payback for those bad things . <p> She waited with her jaw set . She was good at action , not patience . But today it had all come together , his unlucky place had materialized : a soccer field , with lots of tweens , their limbs flashing in nylon shorts and jerseys . She herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was n't often because she avoided encounters with strangers as a rule , she told them , " Lucky , " and they generally oohed and aahed and said what a great name it was . <p> People were stupid , as a rule . <p> The soccer fields were full of young bodies . A jamboree was taking place : kids of varying ages playing half-hour games and then moving on to another field to challenge another team . The boys were playing on the north-side fields , over by the water tower . The girls were closer in , on the hard-packed dirt of the south-side fields-fields that looked as if they 'd been forgotten by the parks department . Fields good enough for girls , not for boys . <p> Her lip curled . Figures , she thought . She was n't a man-hater , but she had definite thoughts about certain members of the male sex . She was responsible for the deaths of several of their gender and did n't regret any of them . <p> She waited in her stolen car . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd learned a few things during the twenty-seven years she 'd been on the planet . She knew how to take care of herself . She could accurately fire a gun up to twenty yards . Well , fairly accurately . And she could break into and steal older-model vehicles-the only kind she would drive because she distrusted air bags . Those things could kill you . She knew a guy who would dismantle them for her , which was a good thing , because it was getting harder and harder to find vintage cars available for her purposes , although she currently had a ready supply from Carl 's Automotive and Car Rental . Hunk O'Junks . That 's how they were advertised by the amateurish spray-painted sign posted off Highway 26 , about fifteen miles east of Seaside , Oregon . Hunk O'Junks . Yessirree . They could be rented for $19.99 a day , but Lucky did n't bother with that . A sorry line of tired-looking vehicles they were , too , but they served the purpose . No one noticed when they were gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a simple matter to hot-wire . And she was adept at using a flat bar to slide down the inside of the window and pop the lock . It was then child 's play to dig under the dash , yank the wires , spark the ignition and drive away . <p> But the Hunk O'Junks were perfect in one more aspect : the owner left the keys under the mat . In the early hours of this morning she 'd simply helped herself to the one farthest from the flickering vapor light at the corner of the automotive garage and driven away . The horny mechanic and sometime car thief who 'd shown her the ropes and introduced her to Carl 's Automotive had been as unfaithful as a rutting bull . She 'd used him as a means to an end and they 'd almost parted friends . But he 'd pushed it , had actually attempted to rape her . Lucky had been down that road before and nobody was going to try that again and live . She 'd grabbed a nearby table lamp 's electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bullish enough to scarcely notice , so involved was he in spreading her thighs and jamming himself into her . She 'd pulled the cord taut with all her strength , with all the rage of injustice she 'd nursed from years of abuse . He passed out and she held on . It had n't been his face she was envisioning ; it was someone else 's . Someone faint in her memory , yet dark and looming . Twenty minutes later she 'd surfaced slowly , as if awakening from a long illness , her fingers numb , her mind clearing . She did n't have much faith that anyone would believe her about the attempted rape , so she gathered up the lamp and its cord from the dirty and sparse living room he called home , wiped down everything she 'd touched , and left someone else to find his body . She 'd made the mistake of entering his home after this , their last car-thieving lesson , because she 'd begun to think they were friends . <p> She had n't made that mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her current Hunk O'Junk , her gaze centered on a light brown van parked near the jamboree parking lot exit . This maybe was n't the best venue for what she 'd planned , but it could be worse . And it was where he trolled . And it had that unlucky feel she could almost taste . Edward Letton was n't aware that he was being followed . Did n't know she 'd found him out , that she 'd tailed his van through parks and malls and schools , the environs of little girls . <p> Lucky had originally picked up on Letton by a means she did n't fully understand herself . They 'd crossed paths in a small clothing store in Seaside , a place that specialized in beach togs and gear . She 'd brushed past him and read his desire as if he 'd suddenly whispered his intentions in her ear , making her skin crawl . Glancing back , she saw the way his gaze centered on a young girl who was trying hard to display her breast buds as the real deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the girl thrusting them forward , her back arched like a bow . She was around eleven . Gawky . Unformed and unsure . She both hung by her mother for protection , and stepped away from her scornfully , as if she could n't bear the idea that Mom was so old and completely uncool . <p> Letton stared and stared . He was so hungry Lucky felt his lust like a living thing . It filled her senses as if he were secreting pheromones . Made her ill . So , she started following him . That day she tailed him a good fifty miles , all the way back to Hillsboro and the untidy green-gray house where he lived with his adoring , mentally-suspect wife . Not the brightest jewel on the necklace , her . Letton was some kind of middle-grade manager at a machine-parts company . Lucky had watched him from the parking lot of his workplace and followed him around , in and out of restaurants , to an all-you-can-eat place where she seated herself in the booth in front of him , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-worker she sensed he 'd unerringly watched the girl in the T-shirt serving soup whose chest was so flat she could have been a child . <p> He did n't drive the van to work . It was parked in his garage , and Lucky did n't know about it at first . Neither did his dimwit wife . His garage was his domain . He drove a Honda Accord to work , new enough to be reliable , old enough to be forgettable . She knew those kinds of cars well . <p> And then she realized he used the van when he . That need . She 'd been on the receiving end of it and it had n't been pretty . <p> He had almost grabbed a girl at the mall , but she was with friends and hard to snatch . Lucky had watched him , her gloved hands tensing on the wheel of her appropriated car , but he 'd passed up the chance , though he 'd climbed from his van and paced around it , watching with distress as his victim and friends meandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reach . <p> But here he was , a scant week-and-a-half later . Saturday morning . Cruising past soccer fields was one of his favorite pastimes . She 'd parked today 's Hunk O'Junk , an early ' 90s model , half a block down from his house , dozing a bit as she 'd risen before dawn . When he backed the van out of the drive , she let it disappear around a corner before she started to follow . He did n't try any tricky moves on the way to the fields . He drove straight to the jamboree . Once there , he circled around , parking at the end spot near the girls ' fields , nose out . It was early , so Lucky parked her sedan across from him , a couple of slots down , and let him see her as she locked the vehicle and strolled across the road toward a strip mall with a coffee shop , its door open to the cool morning air . She wanted him to think she was just another soccer mom , biding time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocha . <p> As soon as she was across the street , she circled the east building of the strip mall and settled behind a row of arborvitae directly across from the jamboree parking lot . Hidden behind the trees , she put a pair of binoculars to her eyes , watching Letton through the foliage . <p> More cars arrived . Teams of boys and girls . Letton watched and waited as the girls banded into teams , running in their uniforms , blurs of red , green , yellow , and blue , young legs flashing in heavy shin guards and cleated shoes . <p> She had never played soccer herself . That had not been the kind of childhood she 'd experienced . Mostly she 'd plotted and dreamed of escape . Sometimes she had thought of murder . <p> Now she waited until another crush of people arrived-more vans spilling kids and equipment onto the pavement-then hurried back , blending in with the other moms , sliding into her silver car . Letton was too enthralled by the bounty of adolescent flesh to even notice her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's seat . <p> The teams began to gather in groups , readying for play . Every group was a tight , wiggling pack , like a hive of bees on the move . <p> And then a young girl , ponytail bobbing , broke free , running across the fields toward the parking lot , her gait stuttering a bit as her cleats hit the pavement . What worked on grass did n't offer the same kind of purchase on asphalt . She was clomping toward the portable bathrooms , passing directly in front of Edward Letton 's van . He called to her . Lucky had rolled her own window down and now she turned on the engine and slipped the car into gear , foot light on the brake . <p> " Hey , you 're with the Hornets , right ? " Letton called to the girl , climbing from his seat . He was obviously quoting from the back of their jerseys , which displayed their teams ' names in block letters . He left the door ajar for a quick getaway . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed toward the side door of the van , sliding it open . His pants were still unzipped . <p> " Yeah ? " the girl said warily . <p> " I 've got those extra balls your coach wanted . Let me get ' em . Maybe you could take some back . " <p> " I 'm going to the bathroom . " <p> But Letton was already reaching into the van . The girl hesitated . A soccer ball rolled out and started heading toward her . She automatically went after it , the movement drawing her closer to the van . She picked it up and said , " I ca n't take it now , I 'll come back for it , " reaching toward him , intending to hand it to him . He did n't make a move to meet her , just waited for her to approach . <p> Do n't go , Lucky thought , foot off the brake . Stay back . <p> The girl hesitated . Lucky could practically feel when she made the decision that Letton was " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another step forward Lucky smashed her foot down on the accelerator and jammed the horn with her fist . The car leapt forward like a runner at the gate . The girl jumped back , startled . Edward Letton forgot himself and lurched for the girl , but she 'd automatically moved out of range of the silver car shooting down on them , running for the safety of the soccer fields . Letton glanced up darkly , his plan foiled , glaring murderously at Lucky . His mouth open to ... what ? Berate her for unsafe driving ? He looked mad enough to kill . <p> She slammed into him at thirty and climbing . Threw him skyward . Threw herself forward . The steering wheel jumped from her hands . The sedan 's grill grazed the back bumper of the van . Someone screamed . She grabbed the wheel hard , turning , both arms straining , sensing calamity . Then she spun past the van , tires squealing . Letton 's flying body thunked off the roof of her car and bounced onto the asphalt , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her rearview mirror Lucky stared hard at Letton 's body . She drove away with controlled speed , slowing through a tangle of neighborhoods , weaving her way , heart slamming hot and fast in her chest , zigzagging toward Highway 26 . She had to get this car out of the area and fast . <p> It was only when she was safely away , heading west , keeping up with fast-moving traffic , that she saw the blood on her steering wheel . <p> A glance in the rearview . Her face was covered with blood . The impact had smacked her face into the steering wheel . Her left eye was closing . She had n't even noticed . <p> There was Windex in the back . Rags . Bleach . She would wipe up the evidence , clean herself and the car . All she had to do now was keep the growing pain and swelling under control . Her vision blurred . <p> She had to get to an off road near Carl 's Automotive , one of the myriads of turn-outs on this winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneak the car back onto the weed-choked gravel lot and hope that the front grill , lights , and body were n't too damaged . The vehicle needed to stay undiscovered at the Hunk O'Junks lot for a long time . <p> She swiped at the blood running down her forehead , blinding her . <p> Not good . Not good at all . <p> But she was lucky . She would get away with it . She would ... <p> She just hoped to hell she 'd killed him . <p> Chapter Two Surfacing from a yawning pit of blackness , her eyes adjusted to an unfamiliar room : cream vertical blinds , cream walls , television on a shelf bolted high on the wall , blankets covering what must be her feet , wood veneer footboard . <p> A hospital room . <p> Her heart clutched . She thought of surgery . Pain . Inside her head was a long , silent scream . <p> Automatically , her hand flew up and touched the bandage wrapped around her head . One eye was covered . She did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd blacked out . Far from it . But this time she 'd hurt herself , maybe badly . What had happened ? <p> She had a terrible moment of not knowing who she was . <p> Then she remembered . <p> I 'm lucky , she thought , memory slipping back to her , amorphous , hard to grasp , but at least it was there . At least some of it was there . <p> And she was angry . Hot fury sang through her veins , though she could n't immediately identify the source of her rage . But someone had to pay . She knew that . <p> A nurse was adjusting a monitor that was spitting out paper in a long , running stream . Red squiggles wove over the paper 's lined grid . Her heartbeat . Respiration , maybe ? She closed her eye and pretended to be sleeping . She was n't ready for the inquisition , yet . Was n't ready to find out the whys and wherefores of how she 'd come to be at this hospital . <p> She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . A soft whoosh of air , barely discernible , said the silent door had been opened . Not hearing it close , she carefully lifted her eyelid . As suspected , the wheelchair-wide door was ajar . Anyone could push inside and stare at her , which consumed her with worry . She had to stay awake . <p> The last vestiges of what seemed to be a dream tugged at her consciousness and she fought to hang on to the remnants but they were slippery and insubstantial , spider threads . She was left merely with the sensation that she was heading for a showdown , some distant and unwelcome Armageddon that was going to shatter and rearrange her world . Maybe not for the better . <p> But then she always felt that . Always awoke with that low-grade dread which followed the gaps in her memory . Maybe someday she would wake up and not know who she was at all . Maybe her memory would be gone for good . <p> What would happen then ? <p> The door swung in noiselessly and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with the county sheriff 's department and , seeing her looking at him , he said , " Hello , ma'am . I 'm Detective Will Tanninger with the Winslow County Sheriff 's Department . " <p> She nodded , eyeing him carefully . He was in his mid-thirties with dark brown hair and serious eyes , but she could see the striations at their edges , from squinting them in either laughter or against the sun . " Where am I ? " <p> " Laurelton General Hospital . You 've been admitted as a Jane Doe . Could you tell us your name ? " <p> He was steely polite . Alarm bells rang . What had she done ? It took her a long moment to come up with her name . " Gemma LaPorte . " She hesitated , almost afraid to ask . " Are you here to see me ? " <p> " We do n't know how you got here , Ms. LaPorte . You walked into the ER and collapsed . " <p> Her hand fluttered to her head once again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Did you drive yourself ? " <p> Gemma moved her head slowly from side to side and she felt a twinge of pain . " I do n't remember . " <p> Will paused , regarding her with dark , liquid eyes . She could sense his strength and knew he was good at his job . A tracker . Someone who never gave up . Someone dogged and relentless . She shivered involuntarily as he said , " You do n't remember the circumstances that brought you here ? " <p> " No . " <p> " What 's your last memory ? " <p> Gemma thought about it a minute . " I was making myself breakfast at home . Oatmeal and cinnamon . I was looking out the window and thinking we were drowning in rain . It was a downpour . The dirt was like concrete and the water was pouring over it in sheets . " <p> The deputy was silent for so long that Gemma felt her anxiety rise . She sensed that he was deliberating on an answer . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained for three days . " <p> Will Tanninger regarded the woman with the scared green eye and stark white bandage with a healthy sense of skepticism . Her skin had paled at his words . He understood about trauma-induced amnesia . More often than not , serious accident victims could n't remember the events that led to their hospital stay . But they usually lost a few hours , not days . In Gemma LaPorte 's case , he could n't tell if this was a ploy or the truth . The half of her face he could see was swollen and bruised , blue and purple shadings of color already traveling from her injured side to the other . Even so , he could tell she was rather extraordinary looking . Smooth , prominent cheekbones and a finely sculpted nose beneath a hazel-colored eye that glinted green when hit by the hard morning light coming through a twelve-inch gap in the hospital drapes . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>                    @
