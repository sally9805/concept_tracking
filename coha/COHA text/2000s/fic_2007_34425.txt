1 Quintus Dellius was not a warlike man , nor a warrior when in battle . Whenever possible he concentrated upon what he did best , namely to advise his superiors so subtly that they came to believe the ideas were genuinely theirs . So after Philippi , in which conflict he had neither distinguished himself nor displeased his commanders , Dellius decided to attach his meager person to Mark Antony and go east . It was never possible , Dellius reflected , to choose Rome ; it always boiled down to choosing sides in the massive , convulsive struggles between men determined to control  --  no , be honest , Quintus Dellius !  --  determined to rule Rome . With the murder of Caesar by Brutus , Cassius , and the rest , everyone had assumed that Caesar 's close cousin Mark Antony would inherit his name , his fortune , and his literal millions of clients . But what had Caesar done ? Made a last will and testament that left everything to his eighteen-year-old greatnephew , Gaius Octavius ! He had n't even mentioned Antony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really recovered , so sure had he been that he would step into Caesar 's high red boots . And , typical Antony , he had made no plans to take second place . At first the youtheveryone now called Octavian had n't worried him ; Antony was a man in his prime , a famous general of troops and owner of a large faction in the Senate , whereas Octavian was a sickly adolescent as easy to crush as the carapace of a beetle . Only it had n't worked out that way , and Antony had n't known how to deal with a crafty , sweet-faced boy owning the intellect and wisdom of a seventy-year-old . Most of Rome had assumed that Antony , a notorious spendthrift in desperate need of Caesar 's fortune to pay his debts , had been a part of the conspiracy to eliminate Caesar , and his conduct following the deed had only reinforced that . He made no attempt to punish the assassins ; rather , he had virtually given them the full protection of the law . But Octavian , passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forced him to outlaw them . How had he done that ? By suborning a good percentage of Antony 's legions to his own cause , winning over the people of Rome , and stealing the thirty thousand talents of Caesar 's war chest so brilliantly that no one , even Antony , had managed to prove that Octavian was the thief . Once Octavian had soldiers and money , he gave Antony no choice but to admit him into power as a full equal . After that , Brutus and Cassius made their own bid for power ; uneasy allies , Antony and Octavian had taken their legions to Macedonia and met the forces of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi . A great victory for Antony and Octavian that had n't solved the vexed question of who would end in ruling as the First Man in Rome , an uncrowned king paying lip service to the hallowed illusion that Rome was a republic , governed by an upper house , the Senate , and several Assemblies of the People . Together , the Senate and People of Rome : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts meandered on , victory at Philippi had found Mark Antony without a viable strategy to put Octavian out of the power equation , for Antony was a force of Nature , lusty , impulsive , hot-tempered , and quite lacking foresight . His personal magnetism was great , of that kind which draws men by virtue of the most masculine qualities : courage , an Herculean physique , a well-deserved reputation as a lover of women , and enough brain to make him a formidable orator in the House . His weaknesses tended to be excused , for they were equally masculine : the pleasures of the flesh , and heedless generosity . His answer to the problem of Octavian was to divide the Roman world between them , with a sop thrown to Marcus Lepidus , high priest and owner of a large senatorial faction . Sixty years of on-again , off-again civil war had finally bankrupted Rome , whose people  --  and the people of Italia  --  groaned under poor incomes , shortages of wheat for bread , and a growing conviction that the betters who ruled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status as a popular hero undermined , Antony resolved that he would take the lion 's share , leave the rotting carcass to that jackal Octavian . So after Philippi the victors had carved up the provinces to suit Antony , not Octavian , who inherited the least enviable parts : Rome , Italia , and the big islands of Sicilia , Sardinia , and Corsica , where the wheat was grown to feed the peoples of Italia , long since incapable of feeding themselves . It was a tactic in keeping with Antony 's character , ensuring that the only face Rome and Italia saw would belong to Octavian , while his own glorious deeds elsewhere were assiduously circulated throughout Rome and Italia . Octavian to collect the odium , himself the stout-hearted winner of laurels far from the center of government . As for Lepidus , he had charge of the other wheat province , Africa , a genuine backwater . Ah , but Marcus Antonius did indeed have the lion 's share ! Not only of the provinces , but of the legions . All he lacked was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perennial golden fowl , the East . Of course he had taken all three of the Gauls for himself ; though in the West , they were thoroughly pacifi ed by Caesar , and rich enough to contribute funds for his coming campaigns . His trusted marshals commanded Gaul 's legions , of which there were many ; Gaul could live without his presence . Caesar had been killed within three days of setting out for the East , where he had intended to conquer the fabulously rich and formidable Kingdom of the Parthians , using its plunder to set Rome on her feet again . He had planned to be away for five years , and had planned his campaign with all his legendary genius . So now , with Caesar dead , it would be Marcus Antonius  --  Mark Antony  --  who conquered the Parthians and set Rome upon her feet again . Antony had conned Caesar 's plans and decided that they showed all the old boy 's brilliance , but that he himself could improve on them . One of the reasons why he had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who went east with him ; every last one of them was a crawler , a sucker-up , and knew exactly how to play that biggest of fish , Mark Antony , so susceptible to praise and flattery . Unfortunately , Quintus Dellius did not yet have Antony 's ear , though his advice would have been equally flattering , balm to Antony 's ego . So , riding down the Via Egnatia on a galled and grumpy pony , his balls bruised and his unsupported legs aching , Quintus Dellius waited his chance , which still had n't come when Antony crossed into Asia and stopped in Nicomedia , the capital of his province of Bithynia . Somehow every potentate and client-king Rome owned in the East had sensed that the great Marcus Antonius would head for Nicomedia , and scuttled there in dozens , commandeering the best inns or setting up camp in style on the city 's outskirts . A beautiful place on its dreamy placid inlet , a place that most people had forgotten lay very close to dead Caesar 's heart . But because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempted it from taxes , and Brutus and Cassius , hurrying west to Macedonia , had not ventured north enough to rape it the way they had raped a hundred cities from Judaea to Thrace . Thus the pink and purple marble palace in which Antony took up residence was able to offer legates like Dellius a tiny room in which to stow his luggage and the senior among his servants , his freedman Icarus . That done , Dellius sallied forth to see what was going on , and work out how he was going to snaffl e a place on a couch close enough to Antony to participate in the Great Man 's conversation during dinner . Kings aplenty thronged the public halls , ashen-pale , hearts palpitating because they had backed Brutus and Cassius . Even old King Deiotarus of Galatia , senior in age and years of service , had made the effort to come , escorted by the two among his sons whom Dellius presumed were his favorites . Antony 's bosom friend Poplicola had pointed out Deiotarus to him , but after that Poplicola admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough service in the East to recognize them . Smilingly demure , Dellius moved among the groups in their outlandish apparel , eyes glistening at the size of an emerald or the weight of gold upon a coiffed head . Of course he had good Greek , so Dellius was able to converse with these absolute rulers of places and peoples , his smile growing wider at the thought that , despite the emeralds and the gold , every last one of them was here to pay obsequious homage to Rome , their ultimate ruler . Rome , which had no king , whose senior magistrates wore a simple , purple-bordered white toga and prized the iron ring of some senators over a ton of gold rings ; an iron ring meant that a Roman family had been in and out of offi ce for five hundred years . A thought that made poor Dellius automatically hide his gold senatorial ring in a fold of toga ; no Dellius had yet reached the consulship , no Dellius had been prominent a hundred years ago , let alone five . Caesar had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Antonii were not quite antique enough . And Caesar 's iron ring had gone to Octavian . Oh , air , air ! He needed fresh air ! The palace was built around a huge peristyle garden that had a fountain at its middle athwart a long , shallow pool . It was fashioned of pure white Parian marble in a fishy theme  --  mermen , tritons , dolphins  --  and it was rare in that it had never been painted to imitate real life 's colors . Whoever had sculpted its glorious creatures had been a master ; a connoisseur of fine art , Dellius gravitated to the fountain so quickly that he failed to notice that someone had beaten him to it , was sitting in a dejected huddle on its broad rim . As Dellius neared , the fellow lifted his head ; no chance of avoiding a meeting now . He was a foreigner , and a noble one , for he wore an expensive robe of Tyrian purple brocade artfully interwoven with gold thread , and upon a head of snakelike , greasy black curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough easterners to know that the curls were not dirty greasy ; easterners pomaded their locks with perfumed creams . Most of the royal supplicants inside were Greeks whose ancestors had dwelled in the East for centuries , but this man was a genuine Asian local of a kind Dellius recognized because there were many like him living in Rome . Oh , not clad in Tyrian purple and gold ! Sober fellows who favored homespun fabrics in dark plain colors . Even so , the look was unmistakable ; he who sat on the edge of the fountain was a Jew . " May I join you ? " Dellius asked in Greek , his smile charming . An equally charming smile appeared on the stranger 's jowly face ; a perfectly manicured hand flashing with rings gestured . " Please do . I am Herod of Judaea . " " And I am Quintus Dellius , Roman legate . " " I could n't bear the crush inside , " said Herod , thick lips turning down . " Faugh ! Some of those ingrates have n't had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag . " " You said Herod . No king or prince in front of it ? " " There should be ! My father was Antipater , a prince of Idumaea who stood at the right hand of King Hyrcanus of the Jews . Then the minions of a rival for the throne murdered him . He was too well liked by the Romans , including Caesar . But I dealt with his killer , " Herod said , voice oozing satisfaction . " I watched him die wallowing in the stinking corpses of shellfish at Tyre . " " No death for a Jew , " said Dellius , who knew that much . He inspected Herod more closely , fascinated by the man 's ugliness . Though their ancestry was poles apart , Herod bore a peculiar likeness to Octavian 's intimate Maecenas  --  they both resembled frogs . Herod 's protruding eyes , however , were not Maecenas 's blue ; they were the stony glassy black of obsidian . " As I remember , " Dellius continued , " all of southern Syria declared for Cassius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am beholden to the man , for all that Antonius 's Rome deems him a traitor . He gave me permission to put my father 's murderer to death . " " Cassius was a warrior , " Dellius said pensively . " Had Brutus been one too , the result at Philippi might have been different . " " The birds twitter that Antonius also was handicapped by an inept partner . " " Odd , how loudly birds can twitter , " Dellius answered with a grin . " So what brings you to see Marcus Antonius , Herod ? " " Did you perhaps notice five dowdy sparrows among the flocks of gaudy pheasants inside ? " " No , I ca n't say that I did . Everyone looked like a gaudy pheasant to me . " " Oh , they 're there , my five Sanhedrin sparrows ! Preserving their exclusivity by standing as far from the rest as they can . " " That , in there , means they 're in a corner behind a pillar . " " True , " said Herod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front , howling and beating their breasts . " " You have n't told me yet why you 're here . " " Actually , it 's more that the five sparrows are here . I 'm watching them like a hawk . They intend to see the Triumvir Marcus Antonius and put their case to him . " " What 's their case ? " " That I am intriguing against the rightful succession , and that I , a gentile , have managed to draw close enough to King Hyrcanus and his family to be considered as a suitor for Queen Alexandra 's daughter . An abbreviated version , but to hear the unexpurgated one would take years . " Dellius stared , blinked his shrewd hazel eyes . " A gentile ? I thought you said you were a Jew . " " Not under Mosaic law . My father married Princess Cypros of Nabataea . An Arab . And since Jews count descent in the mother 's line , my father 's children are gentiles . " " Then  --  then what can you accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am let do what must be done . The Jews need a heavy foot on their necks  --  ask any Roman governor of Syria since Pompeius Magnus made Syria a province . I intend to be King of the Jews , whether they like it or not . And I can do it . If I marry a Hasmonaean princess directly descended from Judas Maccabeus . Our children will be Jewish , and I intend to have many children . " " So you 're here to speak in your defense ? " Dellius asked . " I am . The deputation from the Sanhedrin will demand that I and all the members of my family be exiled on pain of death . They 're not game to do that without Rome 's permission . " " Well , there 's not much in it when it comes to backing Cassius the loser , " said Dellius cheerily . " Antonius will have to choose between two factions that supported the wrong man . " " But my father supported Julius Caesar , " Herod said . " What I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to live in Judaea and advance my status , I will always stand for Rome . He was in Syria years ago when Gabinius was its governor , so he must be aware how obstreperous the Jews are . But will he remember that my father helped Caesar ? " " Hmm , " purred Dellius , squinting at the rainbow sparkles of the water jetting from a dolphin 's mouth . " Why should Marcus Antonius remember that , when more recently you were Cassius 's man ? As , I gather , was your father before he died . " " I am no mean advocate , I can plead my case . " " Provided you are permitted the chance . " Dellius got up and held out his hand , shook Herod 's warmly . " I wish you well , Herod of Judaea . If I can help you , I will . " " You would find me very grateful . " " Rubbish ! " Dellius laughed as he walked away . " All your money is on your back . " Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sixty men in his entourage had expected that Nicomedia would see Antony the Sybarite erupt . An opinion shared by a troupe of musicians and dancers who had hastened from Byzantium at the news of his advent in the neighborhood ; from Spain to Babylonia , every member of the League of Dionysiac Entertainers knew the name Marcus Antonius . Then , to general amazement , Antony had dismissed the troupe with a bag of gold and stayed sober , albeit with a sad , wistful expression on his ugly-handsome face . " Ca n't be done , Poplicola , " he said to his best friend with a sigh . " Did you see how many potentates were lining the road as we came in ? Cluttering up the halls the moment the steward opened the doors ? All here to steal a march on Rome  --  and me . Well , I do n't intend to let that happen . I did n't choose the East as my bailiwick to be diddled out of the goodies the East possesses in such abundance . So I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and a settled stomach . " He giggled . " Oh , Lucius , do you remember how disgusted Cicero was when I spewed into your toga on the rostra ? " Another giggle , a shrug . " Business , Antonius , business ! " he apostrophized himself . " They 're hailing me as the new Dionysus , but they 're about to discover that for the time being I 'm dour old Saturn . " The red-brown eyes , too small and close together to please a portrait sculptor , twinkled . " The new Dionysus ! God of wine and pleasure  --  I must say I rather like the comparison . The best they did for Caesar was simply God . " Having known Antony since they were boys , Poplicola did n't say that he thought God was superior to the God of This or That ; his chief job was to keep Antony governing , so he greeted this speech with relief . That was the thing about Antony ; he could suddenly cease his carousing  --  sometimes for months on end  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now . And he was right ; the potentatic invasion meant trouble as well as hard work , therefore it behooved Antony to get to know them individually , learn which rulers should keep their thrones , which lose them . In other words , which rulers were best for Rome . All of which meant that Dellius held out scant hope that he would achieve his goal of moving closer to Antony in Nicomedia . Then Fortuna entered the picture , commencing with Antony 's command that dinner would not be in the afternoon , but later . And as Antony 's gaze roved across the sixty Romans strolling into the dining room , for some obscure reason it lit upon Quintus Dellius . There was something about him that the Great Man liked , though he was n't sure what ; perhaps a soothing quality that Dellius could smear over even the most unpalatable subjects like a balm . " Ho , Dellius ! " he roared . " Join Poplicola and me ! " The brothers Decidius Saxa bristled , as did Barbatius and a few others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dellius shed his toga on the floor and sat on the back of the couch that formed the bottom of the U. While a servant gathered up the toga and folded it  --  a difficult task  --  another servant removed Dellius 's shoes and washed his feet . Dellius did n't make the mistake of usurping the locus consularis ; Antony would occupy that , with Poplicola in the middle . His was the far end of the couch , socially the least desirable position , but for Dellius  --  what an elevation ! He could feel the eyes boring into him , the minds behind them busy trying to work out what he had done to earn this promotion . The meal was good , if not quite Roman enough  --  too much lamb , bland fish , peculiar seasonings , alien sauces . However , there was a pepper slave with his mortar and pestle , and if a Roman diner could snap his fingers for a pinch of freshly ground pepper , anything was edible , even German boiled beef . Samian wine flowed , though well watered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered , Dellius did the same . At first he said nothing , but as the main courses were taken out and the sweeties brought in , Antony belched loudly , patted his flat belly , and sighed contentedly . " So , Dellius , what did you think of the vast array of kings and princes ? " he asked affably . " Very strange people , Marcus Antonius , particularly to one who has never been to the East . " " Strange ? Aye , they 're that , all right ! Cunning as sewer rats , more faces than Janus , and daggers so sharp you never feel them slide between your ribs . Odd , that they backed Brutus and Cassius against me . " " Not really so odd , " said Poplicola , who had a sweet tooth and was slurping at a confection of sesame seeds bound with honey . " They made the same mistake with Caesar  --  backed Pompeius Magnus . You campaigned in the West , just like Caesar . They did n't know your mettle . Brutus was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Gaius Cassius . He escaped annihilation with Crassus at Carrhae , then governed Syria extremely well at the ripe old age of thirty . Cassius was the stuff of legends . " " I agree , " said Dellius . " Their world is confined to the eastern end of Our Sea . What goes on in the Spains and the Gauls at the western end is an unknown . " " True . " Antony grimaced at the syrupy dishes on the low table in front of the couch . " Poplicola , wash your face ! I do n't know how you can stomach this honeyed mush . " Poplicola wriggled to the back of the couch while Antony looked at Dellius with an expression that said he understood much that Dellius had hoped to hide : the penury , the New Man status , the vaunting ambition . " Did any among the sewer rats take your fancy , Dellius ? " " One , Marcus Antonius . A Jew named Herod . " " Ah ! The rose among five weeds . " " His metaphor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Antony laughed , a deep rich bellow . " Well , with Deiotarus , Ariobarzanes , and Pharnaces here , I 'm not likely to have much time to devote to half a dozen quarrelsome Jews . No wonder the five weeds hate our rose Herod , though . " " Why ? " asked Dellius , assuming a look of awed interest . " For a start , the regalia . Jews do n't bedizen themselves in gold and Tyrian purple  --  it 's against their laws . No kingly trappings , no images , and their gold goes into their Great Temple in the name of all the people . Crassus robbed the Great Temple of two thousand gold talents before he set off to conquer the Kingdom of the Parthians . The Jews cursed him , and he died ignominiously . Then came Pompeius Magnus asking for gold , then Caesar , then Cassius . They hope I wo n't do the same , but they know I will . Like Caesar , I 'll ask them for a sum equal to what Cassius asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah  --  " " Caesar demanded a sum equal to what they gave Magnus . " " Oh , I see ! I beg pardon for my ignorance . " " We 're all here to learn , Quintus Dellius , and you strike me as quick to learn . So fi ll me in on these Jews . What do the weeds want , and what does Herod the rose want ? " " The weeds want Herod exiled under pain of death , " Dellius said , abandoning the avian metaphor . If Antony liked his own better , so would Dellius . " Herod wants a Roman decree allowing him to live freely in Judaea . " " And who will benefit Rome more ? " " Herod , " Dellius answered without hesitation . " He may not be a Jew according to their lights , but he wants to rule them by marrying some princess with the proper blood . If he succeeds , I think Rome will have a faithful ally . " " Dellius , Dellius ! Surely you ca n't think Herod faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin . " Definitely , when it 's in his best interests . And since he knows the people he wants to rule hate him enough to kill him if they get a tenth of a chance , Rome will always serve his interests better than they will . While Rome is his ally , he 's safe from all but poison or ambush , and I ca n't see him eating or drinking anything that has n't been thoroughly tasted , no going abroad without a bodyguard of non-Jews he pays extremely well . " " Thank you , Dellius ! " Poplicola intruded his person between them . " Solved one problem , eh , Antonius ? " " With some help from Dellius , yes . Steward , clear the room ! " Antony bellowed . " Where 's Lucilius ? I need Lucilius ! " On the morrow the five members of the Jewish Sanhedrin found themselves first on the list of supplicants Mark Antony 's herald called . Antony was clad in his purple-bordered toga and carried the plain ivory wand of his high imperium ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beloved secretary , Lucilius , who had belonged to Brutus . Twelve lictors in crimson stood to either side of his ivory curule chair , the axed bundles of rods balanced between their feet . A dais raised them above the crowded floor . The Sanhedrin leader began to orate in good Greek , but in a style so florid and convoluted that it took him a tediously long time to say who the five of them were , and why they had been deputed to come so far to see the Triumvir Marcus Antonius . " Oh , shut up ! " Antony barked without warning . " Shut up and go home ! " He snatched a scroll from Lucilius , unfurled it , and brandished it fiercely . " This document was found among Gaius Cassius 's papers after Philippi . It states that only Antipater , chancellor to the so-called King Hyrcanus at that time , and his sons Phasael and Herod , managed to raise any gold for Cassius 's cause . The Jews tendered nothing except a beaker of poison for Antipater . Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong cause , it 's clear to me that the Jews have far more love for gold than for Rome . When I reach Judaea , what will change from that ? Why , nothing ! In this man Herod I see someone willing to pay Rome her tributes and taxes  --  which go , I might remind you all , to preserve the peace and well- being of your realms ! When you gave to Cassius , you simply funded his army and fleets ! Cassius was a sacrilegious traitor who took what was rightfully Rome 's ! Ah , do you shiver in your shoes , Deiotarus ? Well you should ! " I had forgotten , thought the listening Dellius , how pungently he can speak . He 's using the Jews to inform all of them that he will not be merciful . Antony returned to the subject . " In the name of the Senate and People of Rome , I hereby command that Herod , his brother Phasael and all his family are free to dwell anywhere in any Roman land , including Judaea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his people , but in the eyes of Rome he is no more and no less than an ethnarch . Judaea is no longer a single land . It is five small regions dotted around southern Syria , and five small regions it will remain . Hyrcanus can have Jerusalem , Gazara , and Jericho . Phasael the son of Antipater will be the tetrarch of Sepphora . Herod the son of Antipater will be the tetrarch of Amathus . And be warned ! If there is any trouble in southern Syria , I will crush the Jews like so many eggshells ! " I did it , I did it ! cried Dellius to himself , bursting with happiness . Antonius listened to me ! Herod was by the fountain , but his face was pinched and white , not suffused with the joy that Dellius expected to see . What was the matter ? What could be the matter ? He had come a stateless pauper , he would leave a tetrarch . " Are n't you pleased ? " Dellius asked . " You won without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did Antonius have to elevate my brother too ? " Herod demanded harshly , though he spoke to someone who was n't there . " He has put us on an equal footing ! How can I wed Mariamne when Phasael is not only my equal in rank , but also my older brother ? It 's Phasael will wed her ! " " Come , come , " said Dellius gently . " That 's all in the future , Herod . For the moment , accept Antonius 's judgement as more than you had hoped to gain . He 's come down on your side  --  the five sparrows have just had their wings clipped . " " Yes , yes , I see all that , Dellius , but this Marcus Antonius is clever ! He wants what the farsighted Romans all want  --  balance . And to put me alone on an equal footing with Hyrcanus is not a Roman enough answer . Phasael and I in one pan , Hyrcanus in the other . Oh , Marcus Antonius , you are clever ! Caesar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolt . Now I find another Caesar . " Dellius watched Herod plod off , his mind whirling . Between that brief conversation over dinner and this audience today , Mark Antony had done some research . That was why he 'd hollered for Lucilius ! And what frauds they were , he and Octavian ! Burned all Brutus 's and Cassius 's papers , indeed ! But , like Herod , I deemed Antonius an educated dolt . He is not , he is not ! thought Dellius , gasping . He 's crafty and clever . He will put his hands on everything in the East , raising this man , lowering that man , until the client-kingdoms and satrapies are absolutely his . Not Rome 's . His . He has sent Octavian back to Italia and a task so big it will break so weak and sickly a youth , but just in case Octavian does n't break , Antonius will be ready . 2 When Antony left the capital of Bithynia , all of the potentates save Herod and the fi ve members of the Sanhedrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers of Rome , still maintaining that Brutus and Cassius had duped them , lied to them , coerced them  --  ai , ai , ai , forced them ! Having scant patience for eastern weeping and wailing , Antony did n't do what Pompey the Great , Caesar , and the rest had done  --  invite the most important among them to join him for dinner , travel in his party . No , Mark Antony pretended that his regal camp followers did n't exist all the way from Nicomedia to Ancyra , the only town of any size in Galatia . Here , amid the rolling grassy expanses of the best grazing country east of Gaul , he had perforce to move into Deiotarus 's palace and strive to be amiable . Four days of that were three too many , but during that time Antony informed Deiotarus that he was to keep his kingdom  --  for the moment . His second most favored son , Deiotarus Philadelphus , was gifted with the wild , mountainous fief of Paphlagonia ( it was of no use to anybody ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what the old king should have made of that was now beyond his dwindling mental faculties . To all the Romans with Antony , it meant that eventually drastic changes would be made to Galatia , and not for the benefit of any Deiotarid . For information about Galatia , Antony talked to the old king 's secretary , a noble Galatian named Amyntas who was young , well-educated , efficient , and clear-sighted . " At least , " said Antony jovially as the Roman column set off for Cappadocia , " we 've lost a decent percentage of our hangers-on ! That gushing idiot Castor even brought the fellow who clips his toenails . Amazing , that a warrior like Deiotarus should produce such a perfect pansy . " He was speaking to Dellius , who now rode an easy-gaited roan mare and had passed the grumpy pony to Icarus , previously doomed to walk . " You 've lost Pharnaces and his court too , " said Dellius . " Pah ! He ought never to have come . " Antony 's lips curled in contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather much better still . " " You mean the great Mithridates ? " " Is there any other ? Now there was a man , Dellius , who almost beat Rome . Formidable . " " Pompeius Magnus defeated him easily . " " Rubbish ! Lucullus defeated him . Pompeius Magnus just cashed in on the fruits of Lucullus 's labors . He had a habit of doing that , did Magnus . But his vaingloriousness got him in the end . He began to believe his own publicity . Fancy anyone , Roman or otherwise , thinking he could beat Caesar ! " " You would have beaten Caesar with no trouble , Antonius , " said Dellius without a trace of sycophancy in his tone . " I ? Not if every god there is fought on my side ! Caesar was in a class all his own , and there 's no disgrace in saying that . Over fifty battles he generaled , and never lost a one . Oh , I 'd beat Magnus if he still lived  --  or Lucullus , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone down to him . " The voice , a light tenor surprising in such a big man , held no resentment . Nor even , refl ected Dellius , guilt . Antonius fully subscribes to the Roman way of looking at things : because he had lifted no finger against Caesar , he can sleep at night . To plot and scheme is no crime , even when a crime is committed thanks to the plotting and scheming . Singing their marching songs lustily , the two legions and mass of cavalry Antony had with him entered the gorge country of the great red river , Halys , beautiful beyond Roman imagination , so rich and ruddy were the rocks , so tortured the planes of cliffs and shelves . There was ample flat ground on either bank of the broad stream , flowing sluggishly because the snows of the high peaks had not yet melted . Which was why Antony was marching overland to Syria ; winter seas were too dangerous for sailing , and Antony preferred to stay with his men until he could be sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had belonged . The weather was chilly but bitter only when the wind got up , and down in the bottom of the gorge country there was little wind . Despite its color , the water was potable for men as well as horses ; central Anatolia was not a populous place . Eusebeia Mazaca sat at the foot of the vast volcano Argaeus , white with snow , for no one in history remembered its erupting . A blue city , small and impoverished ; everyone had looted it time out of mind , for its kings were weak and too parsimonious to keep an army . It was here that Antony began to realize how difficult it was going to be to squeeze yet more gold and treasure out of the East ; Brutus and Cassius had plundered whatever King Mithridates the Great had overlooked . A realization that put him severely out of sorts and sent him with Poplicola , the brothers Decidius Saxa , and Dellius to inspect the priest-kingdom of Ma at Comana , not far distant from Eusebeia Mazaca . Let the senile King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denuded palace ! Perhaps at Comana he would find a hoard of gold beneath an innocent-looking flagstone  --  priests left kings for dead when it came to protecting their money . Ma was an incarnation of Kubaba Cybele , the Great Earth Mother who had ruled all the gods , male and female , when humanity first learned to tell its history around the campfi res . Over the aeons she had lost her power save in places like the two Comanas , one here in Cappadocia , the other north in Pontus , and in Pessinus , not far from where Alexander the Great had cut the Gordian knot with his sword . Each of these three precincts was governed as an independent realm , its king also serving as high priest , and each lay within natural boundaries like Pontic cherries in a bowl . Scorning an escort of troops , Antony , his four friends , and plenty of servants rode into the beguiling little village of Cappadocian Comana , noting with approval its costly dwellings , the gardens promising a profusion of flowers in the coming spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , surrounded by a grove of birches , with poplars down either side of a paved avenue that led straight to Ma 's earthly house . Off to one side was the palace ; like the temple , its Doric columns were blue with scarlet bases and capitals ; the walls behind were a much darker blue , and the shingled roof edged in gilt . A young man who looked in his late teens was waiting for them in front of the palace , clad in layers of green gauze , a round gold hat upon his head , which was shaven . " Marcus Antonius , " said Antony , sliding from his dappled grey Public Horse and tossing its reins to one of the three servants he had brought with him . " Welcome , lord Antonius , " said the young man , bowing low . " Just Antonius will do . We do n't have any lords in Rome . What 's your name , shaveling ? " " Archelaus Sisenes . I am priest-king of Ma . " " Bit young to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too young than too old , Marcus Antonius . Come into my house . " The visit started off with wary verbal fencing , at which King Archelaus Sisenes , even younger than Octavian , proved a match for Antony , whose good nature inclined him to admire a master of the art . As indeed he might have happily tolerated Octavian , had not Octavian been Caesar 's heir . But though the buildings were lovely and the landscaping good enough to please a Roman heart , an hour on the water clock was quite enough time to discover that whatever wealth Ma of Comana might once have possessed had vanished . With a ride of only fifty miles between them and the Cappadocian capital , Antony 's friends were fully prepared to set out at dawn of the following day to rejoin the legions and continue the march . " Will it offend you if my mother attends our dinner ? " the priest-king asked , tone deferential . " And my young brothers ? " " The more , the merrier , " said Antony , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to several vexed questions , but it would be prudent to see for himself what kind of family had produced this intelligent , precocious , fearless fellow . Archelaus Sisenes and his brothers were a handsome trio , with quick wits , a thorough knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy , and even a smattering of mathematics . None of which mattered the moment Glaphyra entered the room . Like all the Great Mother 's female acolytes , she had gone into service for the Goddess at thirteen , but not , like the rest of that year 's intake of pubescent virgins , to spread her mat inside the temple and offer her maidenhead to the first comer who fancied her . Glaphyra was royal , and chose her own mate where she wished . Her eye had lighted upon a visiting Roman senator , who sired Archelaus Sisenes without ever knowing that he had ; she was all of fourteen when she bore the boy . The next son belonged to the King of Olba , descended from the archer Teucer , who fought with his brother Ajax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome nobody guiding a team of oxen in a caravan from Media . After that Glaphyra hung up her girdle and devoted her energies to bringing up her boys . At this moment she was thirty-four and looked twenty-four . Though Poplicola wondered what drove her to appear for dinner when the guest of honor was a notorious philanderer , Glaphyra knew very well why . Lust did not enter the picture ; she who belonged to the Great Mother had long ago abrogated lust as demeaning . No , she wanted more for her sons than a tiny priest-kingdom ! She was after as much of Anatolia as she could get , and if Marcus Antonius was the kind of man gossip said he was , then he was her chance . Antony sucked in his breath audibly  --  what a beauty ! Tall and lissome , long legs and magnificent breasts , and a face to rival Helen 's  --  lush red lips , skin as flawless as a rose petal , lustrous blue eyes between thick dark lashes , and absolutely straight flaxen hair that hung down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels she wore none , probably because she had none to wear . Her blue , Greek-style gown was plain wool . Poplicola and Dellius were shoved off the couch so quickly that they were hard put to land on their feet ; one huge hand was already patting the space where they had reclined . " Here , with me , you gorgeous creature ! What 's your name ? " " Glaphyra , " she said , kicking off her felt slippers and waiting until a servant pulled warm socks over her feet . Then she swung her body onto the couch , but far enough away from Antony to prevent his hugging her , which he showed every sign of wanting to do . Gossip was certainly right in saying that he was n't a subtle lover , if his greeting was anything to go by . Gorgeous creature , indeed ! He thinks of women as conveniences , but I , resolved Glaphyra , must exert myself to become a more convenient convenience than his horse , his secretary , or his chamber pot . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a girl . A girl of Antonius 's could marry the King of the Parthians  --  what an alliance ! As well that we are taught to suck with our vaginas better than a fellatrix can with her mouth ! I will enslave him . Thus it was that Antony lingered in Comana for the rest of winter , and when early in March he finally set out for Cilicia and Tarsus , he took Glaphyra with him . His ten thousand infantrymen had n't minded this unexpected furlough ; Cappadocia was a land of women whose men had been slaughtered on some battlefield or carted off to slavery . As these legionaries could farm as well as they soldiered , they enjoyed the break . Originally Caesar had recruited them across the Padus River in Italian Gaul , and , apart from the higher altitude , Cappadocia was n't so very different to farm or graze . Behind them they left several thousand hybrid Romans in utero , properly prepared and planted land , and many thousands of grateful women . They descended a good Roman road between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , larch , spruce , fir , the sound of roaring water perpetually in their ears , until at the pass of the Cilician Gates the road was so steep it was stepped at five-pace intervals . Going down , a comb of Hymettan honey ; had they been going up , the fragrant air would have been polluted by splendid Latin obscenities . With the snow melting fast now , the headwaters of the Cydnus River boiled and tumbled like a huge swirling cauldron , but once through the Cilician Gates the road became easier and the nights warmer . They were dropping rapidly toward the coast of Our Sea . Tarsus , which lay on the Cydnus some twenty miles inland , came as a shock . Like Athens , Ephesus , Pergamum , and Antioch , it was a city most Roman nobles knew , even if from a fl eeting visit . A jewel of a place , hugely rich . But no more . Cassius had levied such a massive fine on Tarsus that , having melted down every gold or silver work of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the populace gradually into slavery , starting with the lowest born and working their way inexorably upward . By the time Cassius had grown tired of waiting and sailed off with the five hundred talents of gold Tarsus had thus far managed to scrape together , only a few thousand free people were left out of what had been half a million . But not to enjoy their wealth ; that had gone beyond recall . " By all the gods I hate Cassius ! " Antony cried , farther than ever from the riches he had expected . " If he did this to Tarsus , what did he do in Syria ? " " Cheer up , Antonius , " Dellius said . " All is not lost . " By now he had supplanted Poplicola as Antony 's chief source of information , which was what he wanted . Let Poplicola have the joy of being Antony 's intimate ! He , Quintus Dellius , was well content to be the man whose advice Antony esteemed , and right at this dark moment he had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of all Cilician trade , but once Cassius hove in view , the whole of Cilicia Pedia stayed well away from Tarsus . Cilicia Pedia is rich and fertile , but no Roman governor has ever succeeded in taxing it . The region is run by brigands and renegade Arabs who get away with far more than Cassius ever did . Why not send your troops into Cilicia Pedia and see what 's to be found ? You can stay here  --  put Barbatius in command . " Good counsel , and Antony knew it . Better by far to make the Cilicians bear the cost of victualing his troops than poor Tarsus , especially if there were bandit strongholds to be looted . " Sensible advice that I intend to take , " Antony said , " but it wo n't be anything like enough . Finally I understand why Caesar was determined to conquer the Parthians  --  there 's no real wealth to be had this side of Mesopotamia . Oh , curse Octavianus ! He pinched Caesar 's war chest , the little worm ! While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dying in Brundisium , would never last ten miles on the Via Appia . And what do the stay-at-home letters have to say here in Tarsus ? Why , that he coughed and spluttered all the way to Rome , where he 's busy smarming up to the legion representatives . Commandeering the public land of every place that cheered for Brutus and Cassius when he is n't bending his arse over a barrel for apes like Agrippa to bugger ! " Get him off the subject of Octavian , thought Dellius , or he will forget sobriety and holler for unwatered wine . That snaky bitch Glaphyra does n't help  --  too busy working for her sons . So he clicked his tongue , a sound of sympathy , and eased Antony back onto the subject of where to get money in the bankrupt East . " There is an alternative to the Parthians , Antonius . " " Antioch ? Tyre , Sidon ? Cassius got to them first . " " Yes , but he did n't get as far as Egypt . " Dellius let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syrup . " Egypt can buy and sell Rome  --  everyone who ever heard Marcus Crassus talk knows that . Cassius was on his way to invade Egypt when Brutus summoned him to Sardis . He took Allienus 's four Egyptian legions , yes , but , alas , in Syria . Queen Cleopatra can not be impeached for that , but she did n't send any aid to you and Octavianus either . I think her inaction can be construed as worth a ten-thousand-talent fine . " Antony grunted . " Huh ! Daydreams , Dellius . " " No , definitely not ! Egypt is fabulously rich . " Half listening , Antony studied a letter from his warlike wife , Fulvia . In it she complained about Octavian 's perfidies and described the precariousness of Octavian 's position in blunt , graphic terms . Now , she scrawled in her own hand , was the time to rouse Italia and Rome against him ! And Lucius thought this too : Lucius was beginning to enlist legions . Rubbish , thought Antony , who knew his brother Lucius too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abacus . Lucius leading a revolution ? No , he was just enlisting men for big brother Marcus . Admittedly , Lucius was consul this year , but his colleague was Vatia , who would be running things . Oh , women ! Why could n't Fulvia devote herself to disciplining her children ? The brood she had borne Clodius was grown and off her hands , but she still had her son by Curio and his own two sons . Of course by now Antony knew that he would have to postpone his expedition against the Parthians for at least another year . Not only did shortage of funds render it impossible ; so did the need to watch Octavian closely . His most competent marshals , Pollio , Calenus , and trusty old Ventidius , had to be stationed in the West with the bulk of his legions just to keep that eye on Octavian . Who had written him a letter begging that he use his infl uence to call off Sextus Pompeius , busy raiding the sea lanes to steal Rome 's wheat like a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their agreement , Octavian whinged  --  did Marcus Antonius not remember how the two of them had sat down together after Philippi to divide up the duties of the three triumvirs ? Indeed I remember , thought Antony grimly . It was after I won Philippi that I saw as through crystal that there was nowhere in the West to reap enough glory for me to eclipse Caesar . To surpass Caesar , I will have to crush the Parthians . Fulvia 's scroll fell to the desk top , curled itself up . " Do you really believe that Egypt can produce that sort of money ? " he asked , looking up at Dellius . " Certainly ! " said Dellius heartily . " Think about it , Antonius ! Gold from Nubia , ocean pearls from Taprobane , precious stones from the Sinus Arabicus , ivory from the Horn of Africa , spices from India and Aethiopia , the world 's paper monopoly , and more wheat than there are people to eat it . The Egyptian public income is six thousand gold talents a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " You 've been doing your homework , " said Antony with a grin . " More willingly than ever I did when a schoolboy . " Antony got up and walked to the window that looked out over the agora to where , between the trees , ship 's masts speared the cloudless sky . Not that he saw any of it ; his eyes were turned inward , remembering the scrawny little creature Caesar had installed in a marble villa on the wrong side of Father Tiber . How Cleopatra had railed at being excluded from the interior of Rome ! Not in front of Caesar , who would n't put up with tantrums , but behind his back it had been a different story . All Caesar 's friends had taken a turn trying to explain to her that she , an anointed queen , was religiously forbidden to enter Rome . Which had n't stopped her complaining ! Thin as a stick she had been , and no reason to suppose she 'd plumped out since she returned home after Caesar died . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship had gone to the bottom of Our Sea ! And how downcast he had been when the rumor proved false . The least of Cicero 's worries , as things turned out  --  he ought never to have thundered forth in the Senate against me ! Tantamount to a death wish . After he was executed , Fulvia thrust a pen through his tongue before I exhibited his head on the rostra . Fulvia ! Now there 's a woman ! I never cared for Cleopatra , never bothered to go to her soirees or her famous dinner parties  --  too highbrow , too many scholars , poets , and historians . And all those beast- headed gods in the room where she prayed ! I admit that I never understood Caesar , but his passion for Cleopatra was the biggest mystery of all . " Very well , Quintus Dellius , " Antony said aloud . " I will order the Queen of Egypt to appear before me in Tarsus to answer charges that she aided Cassius . You can carry the summons yourself . " How wonderful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that led fi rst to Antioch and then south along the coast to Pelusium . He had demanded to be outfi tted in state , and Antony had obliged by giving him a small army of attendants and two squadrons of cavalry as a bodyguard . No traveling by litter , alas ! Too slow to suit the impatient Antony , who had given him one month to reach Alexandria , a thousand miles from Tarsus . Which meant Dellius had to hurry . After all , he did n't know how long it was going to take to convince the Queen that she must obey Antony 's summons , appear before his tribunal in Tarsus
