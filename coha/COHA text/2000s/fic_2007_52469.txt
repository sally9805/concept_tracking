THE MAN , JIMMY PORCELL , was a large fat man with freckles like impressions from rusty nailheads patted onto his face . I never felt kidnapped , not until he showed me the photographs . The photographs were of little boys . Boys laid out dead on narrow beds . The boys were naked and they lay on top of dark bedspreads with their hands folded over their private parts . Tm a photographer , " the man said . He had stopped his black Cadillac to pick me up . We were a few miles down the road when he said , " I thought you were a boy . " " That 's because I wear my hair short , " I said , slightly scandalized , though I was the one who 'd demanded that my brother cut off my wild black hair . " Now I do n't know what I want to do with you . " " I 'm on my way to the beach . " " I suppose I can take you " I 'd been there before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highroad I had only waited a few minutes for a car . I knew-it came to me lightly and swiftly-that I would go on to the next town , and then the next and the next , to see how far off I could get . The country extended away from me limitlessly , and this was its charm . Wherever I was , the ground simply peeled away continuously , headed elsewhere . The ocean would be no different . All of it was connected to itself , not a break in any of it . And here came my first traveling companion . He was a heavy man wearing a brown suit . His grizzled hair was like a thick hair cap set hard onto his head , appearing to make the sides of his face swell out ; the freckles made him look as if he were playing at something . He drove with both hands high on the steering wheel . " You want a drink ? " I said sure . He reached in the back and brought out a soda , a cola drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and handed it to me . " You got a opener ? " He cursed and glared at me , half like he was making a joke , but not really , and said , " Now she wants a bottle opener . " He pulled a small church key from the breast pocket of his suit and holding the bottle against the steering wheel , as if he was afraid to let go of the wheel even with one hand , opened it . The soda spewed against the windshield and he lost control . The car lurched across the empty road and ran through the low grass into a ditch , bumping and slurring a ways before it came to rest . We sat there in silence . The bottle had fallen to the floor . The man was white-faced and his jaw chewed . I could see he was trying to get a grip on himself . I had experienced a surge of emptiness in my stomach . As if a hollow place had blown open . But then it filled back up . I was scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were stopped on a slant , driver 's side angled down into the ditch . The air smelled of grass and fresh-turned earth , like a newly plowed field . The man took his hands off the steering wheel and looked at them . The palms were speckled pink like a baby 's . " I got to get out a minute , " he said . He opened the door-it still worked-and slid out , falling to his knees in the ditch . He pushed himself up and there were wet black circles on his knees . He looked scared , and sad , like he knew the worst was going to happen to him . I slid down and gingerly got out , slipping past the man , and holding onto the hood made my way around to the front of the car . I went up to the road to wave down a passerby , but nobody was coming . Far away a tractor turned in at a farm road , but it was two miles away if anything , and it continued hauling its dust cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , and a breeze tickled the fuzz where I had had my brother shave the back of my neck . Between my shoulder blades I could feel the sweat that must have come up when we wrecked . " You think you can get it out ? " I called down to him . " Like as not , " he said in a mournful voice . I walked a ways along the road and stopped . The fields , pale green at this time of year , stretching away , had a tightfisted , jumbled look , the hollows pressed hard against the swollen places , the grass wind-crawling as if tormented or caressed by swarms of bugs . I felt loneliness like a fever , taking me . I stayed still to feel what it would do . It was familiar and large and filled my body . Far across the fields a flock of crows settled into some pecan trees and lifted off again . They were doing something I did n't recognize . There was nothing much happening in any other quarter . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined me . " I guess we have to hitch a ride , " he said . " You wo n't tell anybody about me , will you ? " " What is there to tell ? " " I do n't know . " He took out his handkerchief , spread it on the grass , and sat down . " I look funny to some people . Act funny , too . Sometimes people get the wrong idea about me . " " What idea is that ? " " That I 'm up to no good . " I stepped up the road and came back . There were beggar's-lice on my sneakers . I sat down in the grass and began to pick them off . " What are you up to ? " " No good . " We both laughed . He said his name was Jimmy . " I know six Jimmies , " I said . " Everybody does . " I realized I would have to make everything up . That was how I would say it later , years from then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly mean by what I was doing . I got up and as if in passing-though it wasn't-touched the man on the back He flinched . I liked that . He squinted up at me . " Maybe a car 'll come soon . " " Maybe not . " I crossed to the other side of the road . The road was a river I waded , and then I was on the far shore . He could n't come after me , I reckoned that . He lay on his back whistling . I did n't recognize the tune but liked it . After a while a car came over the low rise to the south . It seemed at first to be coming through the grass . The man Jimmy got up before it reached us and began signaling . I did n't make any sign , but the car pulled up next to me . The man Jimmy , who was too fat for his own good , made a wobbling trot across the road . The driver of the car looked like a preacher because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He aimed his narrow , clever face at me and asked if I needed any help . " I do n't . But I think he does . " " You know where I can get somebody with a tractor to pull this car out of the ditch ? " the man Jimmy asked . " I can take you to the settlement . " " Well , if there 's nothing else , that will suffice . " He piled into the front . " This is my niece , " he said , indicating me as I got in the back . The back smelled like something had died there . I mentioned this to the driver , and he winced . " It was mice got in . A nest of them . " " How 'd mice get in your car ? " " I did n't use it for six months , and they built a nest . " " Pugh ! " " We 're on the way to the beach , " Jimmy said . His voice sounded false and hopeful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little run . Then I could see in the distance a gap opening up through the woods . It was wide and blue , yellowish at the edges , and there were people riding on horses down it , approaching . I understood these were people from the past , entering the present in a stately and dignified way . For a while now I had brooded over the responsibility I had for my visions . Was I supposed to do something , take some kind of part ? I could n't tell , and nothing was asked directly of me , but I had a feeling that I was a participant and this worried me . For the moment I did n't say anything . The sun , which was keeping up a quiet existence behind clouds so pale they looked not like clouds but a new form of sky , rubbed through , and it shone so brightly on the pale green fields that I thought they were about to change into something else , but they did n't . The riders faded into the background . Often it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations , just a sight seen and passed on from . On that side , too , the other side , heaven or hell or a far boundary land not discovered yet-how could anybody know what it is , I thought-there was n't much going on . We were headed away from the county seat . I did n't mind and felt aloof from what was happening . Then we came to the settlement , Rest Peak ( country store , caf and filling station combo , church , three houses at a crossroads ) , and the driver put us out . " I ca n't take you no farther , " he said with a cross finality . We thanked him , both of us saying thank you in unison-so it must appear we really were kin , I thought-and entered the caf . There was no one inside , so we went into the store and a woman behind the counter directed us to the filling station , which we should have gone into first . There we found a man with a dumb handsome face who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that second . We returned to the caf and took a booth . It was there the man showed me the photographs . " So you wo n't think I am some kind of mysterious person . " " I think these pictures are mysterious , " I said . " You must either really trust me or be especially crazy to show me such a stupid thing . " I said this because the pictures hurt and excited me and I wanted to conceal this . " I do trust you , " he said nervously . I could tell he had to show me the pictures . They were burning him up , I could tell . He had waited as long as he could . It was all not right , though I realized I could stand it . I was a little breathless . " Could I have a CoCola ? " The man Jimmy signaled . I bent down and studied the pictures fanned out on the tabletop , without touching them . " They are holy , " I said . " Nah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waitress would n't see . " Wait ... " " In a minute . " I sucked the Coke until it hurt in my cheekbones . I liked the pain . The man fanned the pictures out , then closed them up , then fanned them out again . He probably did that when he was alone , sitting on a hotel bed , just staring . I probably would , too , I thought , and this embarrassed me . " Why you turning red ? " he said . " The snaps too much for you ? " " They almost are . " " I should n't carry em around , I know . " " It 's really wrong . " I bent down close . The boy on top had light-colored hair and a big nose above a pointed little chin . He looked like he was sorry for whatever he had done . " You said you took these yourself ? " " I did . " " Did people let you , or did you sneak in ? " " They pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " " Where was that ? " " Over to Scotland Neck . " He picked up my Coke and started to swig from it , all in one swift motion , but then he set the glass back down . He rubbed the wet off his palms . " You collecting evidence against me ? " " I do n't know yet . Well , yes , I am collecting evidence , but not necessarily against you . " " What were you doing walking out on the road ? " " Where you picked me up ? I was looking for love . " " Hunh , hunh . How much 'd you find ? " " You 're getting personal now . " I was tired and did n't want to joke with this man . Then I wanted to be kissed . It came on me suddenly . There was a counter , or was it a bar , along one wall . Two men sat over there eating oysters another man behind the counter had shucked and set out for them on trays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else I could n't put my finger on . " Excuse me " I said to Jimmy , then got up and went over to the bar . " Can I sit here ? " I said to the closest man , a stringy fellow in overalls and a hat with a blue patch on it . He had a pinhole eye that intrigued me . " Sure " he said , and acted as if he would snug over on his stool to make room . I hauled up on my own stool and leaned over the counter . In a soft , engaging voice I said , " How much are those oysters ? " to the stringy man , not looking at him as I spoke , just to see if he would get that I was talking to him and answer . " Penny a piece . Ten cents a dozen " I caught him in the corner of my eye . " How about buying me one " " Dozen ? You like oysters ? " " Whenever I can get em . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his companion . Bob , who had black hah- cut short as beard stubble , ducked his head into his shoulders . " You should n't be feeding oysters to a child . " " I can if I want to . And the young lady wants rae to , " he said , smiling at me . His pinhole eye took me in and sent me back out chilled like fruit from the icebox . " Hey , mister , " I said to the man behind the counter . He was skinny , too , but he had a warm , slightly slanted face . " What you need ? " " Could I get a dozen oysters on credit ? " " Ai n't you Mr. Trapnell Marks 's little girl ? " " No . " " I think you are . You look just like him . " " What if I looked like President Hoover-you 'd think I was his daughter ? " " He ai n't got no daughter " the pinhole eye said . " He does , too , " Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio . What 's her name , Rud ? " " Who ? " the bartender , thus addressed , said . " President Hoover 's daughter-what 's her name ? " " Hoover ? " " Nah . His daughter . " " He 's daughterless , " pinhole eye said . " It 's a shame , " Rud said . " A man like that . He could use a good daughter . " " How about those oysters ? " I said . I made smacking noises and licked my top lip . " They look mighty good , do n't they ? " pinhole said . " Why would you want to starve a young girl , Rud ? " he said , leaning slightly forward . The bartender turned half away , scratching at a place below his left ear . " Her daddy , I know him ; he wo n't pay for no oysters . Not if he did n't order em hisself ? " I was angry now , and embarrassed . This was becoming an embarrassing day . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth and asked the fat man , Jimmy , for a quarter . " What you want it for ? " " To get you to stop asking me questions . " " You do n't have to be rude to me . I know I wrecked the car , but I did n't mean to . " I 'm sorry . " " Will you ride with me some more ? " " Probably not . " " That makes me feel terrible . " " If you had your car here right now I would . " " Would you wait till I bring it ? " " I ca n't do that , Jimmy . " " Why do n't I get a room ? " He pursed his lips , looked around , focusing sharply as if he was counting things . " What for ? " " We could take a nap . " OK . " He gave me a case quarter and got up to arrange for a room . They had rooms upstairs , up a box staircase in the back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coin . " I think I 'd rather have a beer instead . How much is that ? " " It 's a nickel . But I ca n't serve you no beer . " " It 's not for me directly . It 's for ... my uncle . " " Who 's your uncle ? " pinhole eye said . " That fat man who just went into the store . " " That man ai n't nobody 's uncle . " The barman eyed me assessingly . " Do n't think he 's yours . " He turned away , then turned back . " Out at your daddy 's place , y all got-ah , I guess you do-y'all probably got ten phones . " " Yep . I mean , I do n't know what you 're talking about . " I felt hot now , tired , and wanted to rest somewhere , briefly , out of the light of scrutiny . I thought of the fat man pressing his face down upon mine . Would it weigh a lot ? I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " His brother ? " the man Bob said , jerking a thumb . " My uncle on the other side . He fell through his kitchen floor . " " Ate one chunk of sidemeat too many , huh ? " " It was n't as funny as it sounds . " " Things rarely are , " pinhole eye said . A nervousness like a rash began to come on me . I had n't meant to stretch the truth or to try to divert attention , none of that , and I had already done it several tunes . Was there something wrong with me ? It was too hard to be among people . " I 'll take that beer now , " I said . The barman would n't give it to me , but it was all right because as it turned out , the man Jimmy had a pint of still-run whiskey in his coat pocket . He showed it to me when we got up to the room . " Did you see how those men 's eyes were following us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something untoward . " " They did n't think we were who we said we were . " " Did you tell em anything ? " " I told them what you told me . But they did n't believe me . " " Gaa . Life 's just a damn comedy . You want a drink ? " " I 'll have a little one . " He splashed a bit into two glasses and handed one to me . " Best to you . " " And to you . " I felt like crowing . The liquor tore my throat and I coughed hard , spewing it on the floor . " Damn . " He looked at me with avid eyes , then looked at the spots of whiskey on the varnished floor board . " You did n't swallow any of it . " " I could n't . " " Try again . " I got it down this time by sipping . It tasted rusty and depleted , as if everything but the rasp had been boiled out of it . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a warm trail . It was all right . I lay down on the bed and balanced the refilled glass on my chest . I pouched my shirt out to conceal the buds of my breasts , just last week appearing . They 'd shocked me , but I had n't let on to anyone , not even my sister out in San Francisco . " I 'm not usually a calm person , " I said . " Me neither . I look like I ought to be-what with being fat and all- " " People expect it . " " You 're right , but I 'm not . I 'm nervous as a dog shitting razor blades . " I let this picture sink in , and winced . " All the time ? " He sat in the threadbare floral armchair , leaning over his knees . The posture squeezed him together in a puffy way . A look of pain crossed his face . " I look and long for anything that will unfluster me . You might say seeking the so-called Balm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made headway ? " " Well , this whiskey helps some . " " It 's making me light-headed . " " That 's good if you carry burdens . " " I 'm eleven . I do n't know what burdens I could be carrying . " But I was lying ; there were plenty of burdens . Probably I could off-load a warehouse full if I had to . All the visions for one . I started to say something about them , but stopped . " We all got burdens-even children . Think of these little dead boys . " He took the pictures from his coat pocket and shuffled through them , stopping here and there to study one . The room 's one window was fogged over with dust . The sun was turning it orange . A rooster crowed , the sound brassy then suddenly disengaging . It made me lonely . He tapped a photo . " A couple of these boys I knew in life " " How did you get so many ? " " This is several years " work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't really a question . I could see how it would . After you got over the shock-or maybe because of the shock . I set the glass on the table , stretched , and plumped up the pillow . " I want to take a nap " I said , though I did n't really intend to . I had a desire to go exploring , play a game of chance if I came on one . " Could I lie down beside you ? " The way he said it-humbly , without sham-touched me . " All right . " I scooted over to the side and watched him carefully settle his bulk . " I know I take up too much room , " he said , turning his back to me . Up close I could smell his fusty , stale chicken-grease odor . I still thought I would ask him to kiss me-or , I thought , I still wanted to be kissed , suddenly very badly-but I could n't bring myself to do it . I scrunched around to face him , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humped and swollen and this unnerved me . Maybe he would crush me . Maybe he would do something worse to me , rise up whooping and ranting , shouting crazy things about God or the devil ; or maybe he would start to cry and want to tell me secrets that he told to no one . Maybe I would stab him then , if I could find a knife somewhere . I wanted him to attack me so I could scream at the top of my lungs and tear his eyes out and leave the room bloody so people would come by for years and say to each other , It was here that brave young girl fought for her life against a madman , and then I wanted him to scrunch quietly around and tell me how he had once fallen in love with a hootchie-cootchie dancer who broke his sorry heart . I turned away from the fat man and pressed my back against his , at first gently and then hard . " Am I taking up too much room ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nah . It feels good . It 's a long time since I had something solid pressed up against me . " That could n't be true , but I knew what he meant . I started to tap his back , thinking I would ask him to kiss me , but just then a key rasped in the lock and the door swung open . Several men burst into the room . " Hold on there , " the first one said . He was a khaki-clothed man I did n't recognize . Behind him were the two men from the bar and a couple of others I had seen before , but I did n't know where . I jumped off the bed in a hurry . The man Jimmy rolled onto his back and pushed partway up on an elbow . The first man had a gun , a pistol , in his hand , and he pointed it at the man Jimmy and told him to stay right where he was . " Do n't move one inch , " he said . The other men fanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in the back , and she pushed up to the front , saying as she came , " It 's all right , is n't it ? " " Y'all better get out of here , " I said , disappointment showing in my voice . " Oh , honey , " the woman said-she was the woman from the store , wearing a man 's straw hat- " you do n't have to be scared now . " " I 'm not scared . I 'm mad . " The man Jimmy had covered his head with his arms , his wrists crossed over his forehead . " Look at him cringe , " the pinhole-eyed man said . He was n't looking at Jimmy , though ; he was looking at me . He might start slobbering any minute , I thought . I started at the men , with my fist raised . But I did n't know what I was doing . Before I reached them , in the short space inside the room that was painted light green and smelled of salt sweat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment or any other , and so I stopped and stood there blinking at them , my head buzzing . A sadness came over me and 1 slumped down . " It 's all right , " the man with the gun said . " Get him off the bed , " he said to the others . I watched as they hauled the man Jimmy up , put handcuffs on him , and rough-walked him out . " We were having an OK time , " he said , looking at me as he passed . He did n't wink , but I wanted him to , wanted something that would make things a little better . I felt sorry for him and sorry for myself because I was too young to do anything . They took me out , left me to sit with the woman in the store , and after a while the man with the gun-he was the deputy sheriff-drove me home . While I was in the store 1 stole a little mirror and a red-hot jawbreaker . It shocked me to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen me take the jawbreaker-no , not might ; she did see me-but she did n't say anything . I could see in her face that she wanted to-was about to-but just then the sheriff came in and said it was time to go . The woman shook her finger at me and I grinned at her . " Where 's Jimmy ? " I asked . " You wo n't be seeing that young man again , " the deputy said . " Not before he 's brought up on trial , that is . " " He did n't do anything . " " Well , he did for a fact-a lot of things . " " You better get on home , " the woman said . I could tell the woman did n't like me . It hurt me a little to be disliked , and I thought of putting the jawbreaker back , but I did n't have the strength to and I did n't really want to either . I could n't tell exactly why I was acting the way I was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You probably just better forget all this for now , " the deputy said . He took my hand in his , tenderly , like he wanted to do it especially , and walked me to the car . Outside I saw the sun was using sunbeams to feel its way through the dust thrown up off the road . Beams , I thought-girders , studs , rafters . The dust glittered , and then four small brown birds flung themselves in full flight through it , veering up over our heads and over the peaked roof of the filling station . I reared back a little , straightening my posture , glad to be alive , glad to be in such a honey-colored , sunshiny world . The rooster , over by the big gas supply tanks , crowed again . On the way home the deputy asked me about what happened with the man Jimmy . Several questions . " At what point did he get overfriendly ? At what time did he do something that made you feel uncomfortable ? What did he do-exactlythat made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too personal ? " " I have to ask you . Jimmy Porcell has committed a crime-several crimes . " " I got slightly nervous when we went into the ditch . " " What ? Did he make you go down there ? What did he do ? " " He gushered a drink all over the car and lost control . " " You mean he went crazy ? " " No . I think he was just shocked . He happened to be driving the car at the time . " " Did he strike you at that point ? " " That man Jimmy ? At which point ? " " The one where he lost control " " How could he hit me ? He was trying to hold on to the car . And he did n't want to hit me anyway . " I was mortified that this man would think any traveling companion of mine would want to strike me . I was n't an unpopular girl . " He was drunk ? " " Not that I noticed . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was my mothers twin sister . I told her she was lying . " " Were you with Jimmy Porcell at that time ? " " No . I met that man Jimmy after I met the old woman . She was an old , old woman-my mama 's not old like that . You ca n't be older than your own twin sister-not by that much . " " That 's true . Now what did Jimmy Porcell make you do down in that ditch ? " I shifted into a silence , my eye caught-or something caught me-on a streak , bright silver and flowing like a river , but where there was no river I could remember . I was sad I was n't going to the beach , was n't , I realized , getting out of this county . Then I did n't want to get out ; I was forlorn , as if something indispensable had been taken from me-forlorn : " The very word , " Papa quoted , " was like a bell . " I wanted to go home , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to Mama , a strange person who had a twin . " You can whisper it in my ear , if you want to , " the deputy said . " Whisper what , exactly ? " " What Jimmy Porcell did to you down in that ditch . " " I do n't have to whisper it . " " But you can if you want to . It 's probably best if you did . " He shifted slightly in the seat , moving a little closer , and inclined his head toward me . I remembered what I 'd felt ; how an open space had appeared inside me , not a lonely place , exactly , though it felt like that at first , but a kind of sunny spot , lonely a little ( you could say ) because it was only me , only inside me , that it appeared-as the visions made me lonely in that way-but charming , too , and appearing ; so that I found myself wandering away from the wreck , across the road that was like a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming really , my eyes following the flight of some crows in the distance that were rising and falling in the tops of pecan trees . " You know how lonely you get sometimes ? " No , that was n't what I wanted to talk about . " Does it make you lonely ? " " Does what ? " " This late experience . I 'd imagine it would . " " Could we go get something to eat ? " " Would n't you rather go home ? " " I 've had enough of home for today . " I did n't even know what I was saying . But I could say anything . I knew already that the world was unsure of what it really was , constantly changing itself , disappearing and reappearing in new and stranger garb . It had holes in it and avenues unmentioned by others I knew . I wondered if the deputy sheriff could see down leafy roads that were on no map . He tapped the steering wheel . " Where would you like to go ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Then could you take me to the orphanage ? " " You poor child . " " Take me somewhere where I can make a phone call . " At the Patio Drive-in I ordered a banana split made entirely with banana ice cream , hold the bananas . " Is n't it interesting , " I said , " how you can love banana ice cream and hate bananas . Is that a bad sign ? " " No , it 's all right . " " I 'm feeling a little faint . Could we go over there under those trees , where that tire swing is ? " Beyond a fence line on the other side of the trees was the city cemetery : a sloping , bumpy expanse of sparse grass set with shaggy cedars . Some of my relatives were buried there . The descending sun seemed to be taking some of the usual color back , some of the grass and the weight of the headstones , too . I imagined riding across the cemetery on a horse , leaning down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the graves . The deputy continued his questioning . He wanted to know what had happened . " It was nothing , " I told him . " We got interrupted . " " Somebody saw you ? " I was tired of listening to this man . He sat on a leached cypress stump like on a commode , leaning over his elbows . His face had a peculiar jut to it , as if it were sticking out from itself , and his leaning made it seem bigger than it was . Halfway through the banana split I was full , but I made myself finish it by imagining that I was lost in a strange forest , alone , with only this to eat . Scout rations , I called such food at home , where nearly every meal I imagined myself out on the trail , lost or lonely , a wanderer , with only this rough homemade pemmican to eat .

I liked standing up for him . Probably tomorrow , if not in a minute , I 'd feel the opposite . He was a sad man , misguided probably , but I could tell he could n't help himself .

I " spect they have one inside . But we can go over to my office after a while . I got one you can use . It 's probably more private . " OK , lets do that .

It was different enough to be something from another world , really , and it took my mind off some things that were beginning to trouble me . I could n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little insinuations and tsks . I stood up , lengthily stretched , and then to my surprise , so swiftly that I did not feel any introductory nausea , leaned over and vomited . Everything came up . " Oh , " I said , " oh , " and swayed . The deputy was on his feet instantly and caught me , caught as well-oddly , I thought , even then-a little of the upsurge in his cupped hands . I backed away , dizzy somewhat , frail , seeing things . He shook the vomit off his fingers-it was yellow-and the look in his startlingly blue eyes troubled me , even as my stomach kicked again and I brought up bitter squirts . Then I felt better . The look was gone from his eyes . He was too interested , I could see that clearly . But I felt paralyzed in a way , not sure of what to do . I had experienced this before around adults , and alone , too , walking out behind the barns , thinking of what I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with anything ; right in the middle of a conversation-even at school-I 'd go blank as if the language or the way of doing things or the world itself simply trailed off-simply quit-and I was left standing there , empty-minded . This was how it was now , a little , as the deputy , who 'd held me first around the waist , then by the shoulders , then not held me at all , stepped back and looked at me . What was the man Jimmy doing right now ? They had probably taken his photos away from him . Years from then , in the women 's prison in Kalima , out in the desert east of Jelidibad , I would remember that afternoon and think of how time on some days piled one thing upon another as if you could n't get enough , as if time itself couldn't-as if there was all the time in the world and plenty to go around . I would think again about the deputy , who became embarrassed and shy like a boy and asked me to excuse him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was gone for a long time-he did n't come back . I climbed the fence , went into the graveyard , and lay down in the uncut grass on the grave of my sister Ronnie , who had died in pregnancy three days before Mama bore me . The baby , I knew , was still inside her body . They had buried them that way , in a grave belonging to her husbands family . I wondered if the baby was still waiting . Of course it wasn't-it had never lived , Mama told me-but still I wondered , and pictured it lying in the dark inside the dark-tiny , mute thing-waiting . When Papa came looking for me I was asleep in the grass and night had come . Author Affiliation CHARLIE SMITH is the author of a dozen books of fiction and poetry .
