Twice And For Always By Cathy Thacker Harlequin Enterprises , Ltd . Harlequin Enterprises , Ltd . Meg Bassett heard a man 's low , husky voice as she stepped through the arched front door of the sandstone building in Seattle 's Belltown area . " I 'll be back at the office as soon as I get this cleared up . Yes , it 's a nuisance , but I 've got to have my pager . No . Tell the managers I 'll be there . I want to have that staff meeting today , no matter how late we all have to stay . " Spoken like a true workaholic , Meg thought . And she ought to recognize one . In fact , if she did n't know full well that Brody Taylor was in Ireland now , she 'd even think that man sounded like her sexy , successful - workaholic - ex-husband . Not that he was of any concern to her now . Her priority was deciding what to do about the mischief her five-year-old daughter Kelly had been getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing this much trouble , Meg thought firmly as she walked down the cheerfully decorated front hall of Forrester Square Day Care . It was only Kelly 's second week in the school , and already she had conspired with another student to disrupt storytime with an impromptu song and dance routine , take off down the street in the day care 's pedal cars and , last but not least , switch Meg 's and another parent 's beepers . If the troublemaking continued at this rate , her daughter and her equally precocious partner in crime would be asked to leave the prestigious new school before the end of the week . And that would be a tremendous problem . Meg needed a good , safe place for Kelly to attend kindergarten while she taught musical theater classes at the university . She had to meet with the other child 's parents and the day care staff to resolve this quickly and amicably , Meg thought as she entered the office and came face-to-face with the man talking on the cell phone . For a moment , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned amazement . It had been five long years since Meg had laid eyes on Brody Taylor , yet nothing much had changed . He was still as tall and fit and ruggedly appealing as ever . Broad shoulders and a sinewy chest filled out his olive tweed sport coat . Long legs and lean hips made the most of his stone-colored dress slacks . His thick black hair was conservatively cut and combed straight back . And his dark brown eyes had zeroed in on her with mesmerizing accuracy . " What are you doing here ? " Meg demanded , aghast . Brody 's strong jaw took on the familiar , stubborn tilt . Using the flat of his palm , he smoothed his silk tie against his crisply ironed shirt . " I came to get my beeper . And I could ask the same thing of you ! " he challenged . " You 're supposed to be in New York . " Meg squared off with Brody , trying not to notice the way he was hungrily drinking in the sight of her , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " And you 're supposed to be in Ireland , " she accused , her heart turning cartwheels in her chest . She had always known she would see Brody again - she just had n't expected it to be so soon . And certainly not without warning . But he was here now , and Kevin , too . With more strength than she knew she had , Meg suppressed the flood of maternal love that rose within her at the knowledge that her little boy was so close . First she had to find out what Brody was up to . Brody blinked , his glance roving over her casually up-swept hair and parted lips before returning to her eyes once more . " You did n't get my letter ? " he asked in a low , piqued voice . Folding her arms in front of her , Meg dug in her heels and regarded him just as contentiously . " You did n't get mine ? " " Someone want to fill me in ? " Katherine Kinard asked dryly as she walked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unison toward the driving force behind Forrester Square Day Care . At twenty-nine , Katherine was a beautiful woman with silky chestnut-brown hair and a big wide smile . " We used to be married , " Meg explained uncomfortably , not sure Katherine would understand just how far awry cupid 's arrow had been when it joined her and Brody together . " We split up five years ago , when Kevin and Kelly were just two months old , " Brody continued matter-of-factly . " We each took one of the twins with us . " " I went to New York to pursue a stage career on Broadway , " Meg added , " and Brody went to Ireland to begin a computer software company . " " Do Kevin and Kelly know they 're twins ? " Katherine asked , a faintly disapproving look coming over her face . Meg and Brody exchanged uneasy glances . " They know they have a sibling their age who lives with their other parent , but that 's all , so far , " Meg said . " We thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a young child . " About that , Katherine Kinard seemed to agree . " We planned to introduce them and tell them everything when they were old enough to understand , say around twelve or so . " Brody frowned , his expression troubled . " We had n't expected to do it so soon . " Katherine sat down behind her desk . " Why did n't you list each other as next of kin on Kevin and Kelly 's applications ? " " Brody and I do n't have joint custody , " Meg explained . " We each assume total responsibility for the twin in our care . " And they had done so for a reason , she thought as she sat down in one of the chairs along the wall opposite Katherine 's desk . Her own parents had divorced when she was very young , and Meg had spent her entire childhood being volleyed back and forth between them , to the point where she 'd ended up feeling insecure and torn apart inside , as if she really did n't belong either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents and was extremely conflicted about that . It had been a sad , unhappy way to grow up . She had n't wanted to inflict similar pain on their twins . Brody settled his six-foot-two frame into the chair next to Meg 's . " Given how far apart the two of us were going to be living , " he elaborated in his usual all-business tone , " Meg and I felt it would be too hard to arrange visitations . So we each took one of the twins , and promised we would let them get acquainted when they were twelve . " " In the meantime , all we 've ever told Kevin and Kelly is that they each have another parent and a sibling living an ocean away , " Meg said . It had been like a fairy tale , or a faraway dream that brought only happy thoughts , and not the pain and heartache of divorce and a family split in two . " Of course , " she sighed , looking back at Brody , " now that Kevin and Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the whole story and go from there . " Brody looked just as daunted by the possibility of doing that as Meg felt . " Maybe I should give you two a moment alone to sort all this out , " Katherine said kindly . " Thanks . " Brody stood and began to roam the office restlessly . " We 'd appreciate that , " he said distractedly . Katherine stepped outside , shutting the door behind her . Meg and Brody were left alone . " I guess we 've both got some explaining to do , " Brody said reluctantly . Meg crossed her legs at the knee and looped her clasped hands around one . " You first . What brought you back to Seattle ? " He could n't have been here for very long . She had just spoken to him five weeks ago , and he had still been in Ireland then . " I 'm opening a U.S. office of Taylor Software here in Seattle . I just moved a few weeks ago . I had my attorney send you a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke on the phone , but I guess the letter did n't reach you . " ( Continues ... ) by Cathy Thacker
