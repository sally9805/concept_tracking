It was n't every day a guy saw a headless beaver marching down the side of a road , not even in Dean Robillard 's larger-than-life world . " Son of a . . . " Dean slammed on the brakes of his brand-new Aston Martin Vanquish and pulled over in front of her . The beaver marched right past , her big flat tail bouncing in the gravel , and her small , sharp nose stuck up in the air . Way up . The beaver looked highly pissed . She was definitely a girl beaver because her beaver head was missing , revealing sweaty , dark hair pulled into a short , scraggly ponytail . He 'd been praying for a little distraction from his own depressing company , so he threw open the door and stepped out onto the shoulder of the Colorado road . His newest pair of Dolce &; Gabbana boots emerged first , followed by the rest of him , all six feet three inches of steely muscle , razor-sharp reflexes , and unsurpassed gorgeousness . . . or at least that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was pretty much true , although Dean did n't have nearly as much personal vanity as he let people believe . But emphasizing the superficial was a good way to keep people from getting any closer than he wanted them to be . " Uh , ma'am . . . You need some help ? " Her paws did n't break rhythm . " You got a gun ? " " Not with me . " " Then I 've got no use for you . " On she marched . Hegrinned and set off after her . With his extra-long legs and her shorter , furry ones , it took just a few steps to catch up . " Nice day , " he said . " A little warmer than I 'm used to for May , but I 'm not complaining . " She hit him with a pair of grape lollipop eyes , one of the few curvy things about her . Most of the rest of her came to sharp angles and delicate points , from a set of fragile bladed cheekbones , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to cut glass . But after that , things got dicey . A razor-edged bow marked the center of a wide and startlingly plump top lip . Her bottom lip was even fuller , giving him the disconcerting feeling that she 'd somehow escaped from an X-rated nursery rhyme . " An actor , " she said with the trace of a sneer . " Just my luck . " " What makes you think I 'm an actor ? " " You 're prettier than my girlfriends . " " It 's a curse . " " You 're not even embarrassed ? " " Some things you have to accept about yourself . " " Brother . . . " She gave a grunt of disgust . " Name 's Heath , " he said , as she picked up the pace . " Heath Champion . " " Sounds phony . " It was , but not in the way she meant . " What do you need a gun for ? " Dean asked . " Murder an old lover . " " Is he the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ol ' paddle tail smacked him in the leg as she spun on him . " Beat it , okay ? " " And miss all the fun ? " She gazed back at his sports car , a lethal , midnight black Aston Martin Vanquish S with a V-12 engine . The machine had set him back a couple of hundred thousand , but even that had n't made much of a dent in his net worth . Being the starting quarterback for the Chicago Stars was pretty much like owning a bank . She nearly poked out her eye as she pushed a sweaty spike of hair away from her cheek with her paw , which did n't seem to be detachable . " I could use a ride . " " Are you going to gnaw my upholstery ? " " Do not mess with me . " " Apologies . " For the first time all day , he was glad he 'd decided to get off the interstate . He tilted his head toward the car . " Hop in . " Even though this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him . He should have helped her in -- he did open the door for her -- but he just stood back to watch the fun . Mainly it was the tail . The sucker was basically spring-loaded , and as she attempted to wedge herself into the leather passenger seat , it kept smacking her in the head . She got so frustrated she tried to rip it off , and when that did n't work , she stomped on it . He scratched his chin . " Are n't you being a little tough on the ol ' beaver ? " " That 's it ! " She started to take off again down the road . He grinned and called out after her . " I apologize . Comments like that are exactly why women have lost respect for men . I 'm ashamed of myself . Here , let me help you . " He watched her struggle between pride and necessity and was n't surprised to see necessity win . When she returned to his side , she let him help fold over her tail . As she clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had to sit on one cheek and peer around the tail to see through the windshield . He climbed behind the wheel . The beaver suit emitted a musky odor that reminded him of a high school locker room . He cracked the window a couple of inches as he pulled back out onto the road . " So where are we off to ? " " About a mile straight ahead . Take a right at the Eternal Life Bible Church . " She was sweating like a linebacker underneath all that malodorous fur , and he turned the AC to full blast . " Are there a lot of career opportunities in beaver work ? " Her derisive look told him she knew exactly how much entertainment he was having at her expense . " I was doing some promotion for Ben 's Big Beaver Lumberyard , okay ? " " When you say promotion . . . " " Ben 's business has been down lately . . . or so I was told . I just got to town nine days ago . " She nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ben 's lumberyard . That four-lane highway back there leads to Home Depot . " " I 'm starting to get the picture . " " Right . Every weekend , Ben tries to hire somebody to stand out by the highway with a sign to draw some of the shoppers his way . I was his latest patsy. "
