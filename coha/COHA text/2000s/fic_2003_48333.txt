We 've been publishing Kit Reed 's sharp stones for upwards of forty years now ( in fact , we hope to have a complete index of the magazine on our Website by the time this issue reaches subscribers-check it out and see for yourself when Kit 's first story appeared here ) . A longtime resident of Middletown , Connecticut , Ms. Reed draws on her Southern roots with this new tale . Ms. Reed 's last novel was @expectations and she reports that her latest . Thinner Than Thou , is nearing completion . <p> SOUTH CAROLINA IS nothing like Nelly thought . " Home , " Mommy said , like it was going to be so great , " I 'm taking you home , " and she had tears in her eyes . Well , it is n't great so far . These woods are dark . The big trees drip gray moss like mummies unwrapping , fixing to run after you . Nelly hides her head as the car crunches along the oyster shell road . Astonishingly , the trees just quit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between it and the sky . It 's like the edge of the world . A ruined hotel sprawls on the banks like a dying thing . Empty rockers line the wooden porches and cement urns on the gateposts spout sprays of pale green blooms . Paper lanterns swing from the overhang and there are flowerpots and flowered cloths on the wicker tables , as though the party is just about to begin . Nobody 's around . Mommy 's voice goes all brave and fluty , like she 's scared . " Well , Nelly , here we are . " " What are you afraid of ? " " Nothing ! It 's just been a long time . " They 're visiting Mommy 's family for the first time since Lucille Cornwall ran away with Hal Peterson and made them all so mad that Mommy was scared to go home . They , what was it Mommy said , they cut her off without a cent . " I have n't been back since before you were born . " " Do you think they 're still mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what they are . " They did n't come here direct . They had to stop at a florist on Bay Street . Mommy made Nelly wait in the car . She waited and waited . She thought Mommy was never coming out . Was something awful happening to her inside the store ? What if she got kidnapped , Nelly wondered , what if she fainted and they were in there waiting for 911 to come ? Had she gone in the front and run right out the back ? Nelly did n't know . She was getting up the nerve to unbuckle her seatbelt and go looking when Mommy came out with a great big wreath with a fat white bow . " What 's that ? " She did n't explain , exactly , she just thrust it into Nelly 's lap . " Here , hold this . When you ca n't be at your own mother 's funeral , you have to come back sooner or later and make amends . " They have come all the way down here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about mending fences , friends are friends but when you 're in need , there 's nothing thicker than blood , but the truth is , they did n't have anywhere else to go . She said everybody needs a place to be , especially Nelly now that Hal is gone . Hal is in Vegas with a new woman and this time , he wo n't be back . He used to be Nelly 's daddy . Now he 's this girl Victoria 's boyfriend , is all . He cut off his mullet and left in a new forest green sports car . When he told her it was over , Mommy cried and cried . " Oh , " she wailed . " Oh , oh . What am I going to do now ? " That night she hugged Nelly and cried some more . " How am I going to take care of you ? " Mommy has n't been herself since Daddy left . She and Nelly sort of mourned for weeks , getting into their jammies before supper and eating Hot Pockets in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with TV light flickering on their faces and stumbled off to bed . Mommy came home sick from work one day and never went back . After a while they had to have supper in the supermarket , free samples of this and that . Then one morning Mommy woke Nelly up before it got light . Get dressed , she said . Their bags were by the front door . We ca n't go on living this way . When Nelly looked back , a truck was taking their furniture away . Mom ! If Mommy noticed , she did n't care . We 're going back to our roots . So far Nelly 's roots turn out to be Aunt Glory , who lives in a development near the Marine base . When they drove in last night Aunt Glory was excited to see them , but there was no place for them in the house on Ribault Road , just a futon in the front room , and there was nothing to eat but Lean Cuisine . Nelly could n't wait to get out of that tight little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get on your feet , " Glory said , " I just do n't have room . " Aunt Glory is cute but she 's kind of a disappointment , like she 's glad to see Mommy , but Nelly is something else . She whispered , so Nelly would n't hear , " What am I supposed to do with her , Lucy , she 's nine . " Glory is nice but in her situation , a kid is only going to get in the way . " Glory , I lost my job . " " Get a grip , Lucy . We 'll find you a man . " Aunt Glory wants Mommy to start having fun with some cute Marines she knows . Last night she said , " Come on , Luce . Hal 's over . It 's time . " " What about Nelly ? " " First things first . You need a life ! Lucille , these guys are really cute . " " Who 's going to babysit Nelly if I go out ? Maybe you .... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See what I mean ? " " Well , do something with her . In your situation , you ca n't afford to have a kid around . " The whole time they were talking Aunt Glory thought Nelly was playing with her stuffed toys out in the car . Mommy 's words squeezed out , whispery and thin . " What am I supposed to do ? " " Oh hell , I do n't know . But I can tell you this , Lucille . In your situation , a kid is only going to get in the way . " Before Mommy could say anything Nelly dropped Teddy and went " Ooops " just loud enough to signify that she was there . Mommy said , fast , " I did n't come to meet men , I came to make my peace . " " Oh , that . Well , you know where they all are , " Glory said . " I do . " Now they are here , although Nelly is n't sure exactly what here is . She thought they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead they are standing in front of the wrecked old hotel , like Gramma and Grandpa are in the biggest and nicest room , just waiting for Mommy to apologize so they can invite her to stay . Nelly is n't supposed to be here at all . Aunt Glory was supposed to keep her today while Mommy came out here and did this , but at breakfast it turned out Glory 's boyfriend had stayed over and they had plans . She told Mommy this at the last minute and they had a fight . " Hell with you , " Glory said . " You 'll never get a fresh start with that attitude . " Mommy was distracted and miserable . " Come on , " she said , shoving Nelly into the car . " Get in . " " Where are we going ? " " To pay my respects . " " What kind of respects ? " " Last respects . Oh , forget it . Do n't worry yourself . " From the front stoop , Glory called , " Say hello for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , " but not loud enough for Glory to hear . When Nelly looked back , her aunt was checking her reflection in the glass storm door ; she had on a short , short skirt with flowers on it and plastic and silver lilies drooping from each ear . Bart , his name was Bart , Bart slipped into the doorway behind her and waved goodbye . Nelly just remembered all of that , even though it was long and embarrassing , and she and Mommy are still on the bottom step . " Are n't we going in ? " " In a minute , " Mommy says . " Are you scared ? Are you scared of what they 'll do to you ? " " They 're mad at me , but they are n't that mad . " " I thought they were dead . " Mommy does not explain . She shifts the wreath to her shoulder like a gardener carrying a hose . " You wait here . " There are gold letters on the white tails of the bow-ribbon , Nelly sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to come . " " You 're too young . Besides , you 'll just get bored . " " Will not . I do n't want to stay here . " " Well , " Mommy said , " you do n't want to come in either , it 's all depressing . Besides , you ca n't . " " Why ? " " Because you are n't ready yet ! There . " Mommy thrusts a Gameboy at her and slaps a roll of Life Savers into her hand , what else does she have in her purse ? Pills , Nelly sees , lots of pills , and she thinks she sees .... " Entertain yourself . " Nelly waits and waits . It 's creepy out here . Where is Mommy , why has n't she come out ; all the old fears roll past behind her eyes : kidnappers , sudden death , mother telling her to wait and just running away . She wo n't know the name for it but any kid who 's ever lost a parent knows - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never coming out . When you give up waiting for them , what are you going to do ? They 'll find Nelly 's bones sitting here , she 'll starve to death waiting for Mommy to come back . When the Life Savers are gone she gets hungry . When she gets bored she sneaks up on the porch . She 's only looking , she is n't hurting anything , what can they do to her ? The place has been so quiet for so long that she whispers into the silence , " Where is everybody ? Is anybody here ? " Louder . " Is anybody here ? " She stamps across the porch . That 'll bring them out . Thud . If anybody comes , she can ask .... Odd , from here the water looks like pale glass that you could walk out on and the invisible horizon is just exactly where you 'd disappear . If she stares at it long enough maybe she will see some person she thought was lost or gone forever , walking back into her life . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide screen door like a swamp mosquito desperate to get in . Nothing opens , nothing moves but in the next second she 's inside . Mean of Mommy , leaving her out there . Extremely pissy , when in here there 's a party going on , people are eating cookies and ginger ale and laughing , and everybody but Nelly is having a good time . Waiters go by with trays and she can see from the hall that the lobby is filled with good-looking people in party clothes that look old-fashioned to her-whatever their relatives picked out as their Sunday best for the big day all those years ago . She wants to run in and join the party but she 's afraid . " Yes , " a guy who looks like Ricky Martin in a sailor suit says . Nelly ca n't be exactly sure he 's talking , any more than she 's certain that she said any of the above out loud . He answers as if she has . " We 're all dead . " " You do n't look dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's so weird . " " Not really , " the sailor says . " How did you get in ? " " How did you ? " " I told you , we 're all dead . It 's okay , you can run away if you 're scared . " " Dead people do n't stay in hotels . " He gives her a sweet look . " Where else would we go ? " " Heaven ? " " Too soon to tell , " he says . A new voice says , " That has n't been decided . " " Whether you 're going ? " Laughing , a woman in a long fur coat drifts in without touching the floor . She says , " Whether there is one . " The sailor says kindly , " Nobody knows the whole truth about being dead . " " What happened to you ? " He laughs . " Pearl Harbor . " " You wish , " the fur coat woman says . " He was in a car wreck outside Charleston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap bar . " " Prohibition Polly , dead on bathtub gin . " Nobody in this hotel matches , not the sailor , not the lady in furs nor any of the old people floating down the halls and definitely not the mean little girl Nelly sees crutching this way in an outfit that looks two hundred years old . She 's scowling as if Nelly has no right to be here , but who does ? She asks , " Are you all from around here ? " " Every town has a place like this . " The woman in furs looks at Nelly through a pair of silver glasses on an ivory stick . " What are you doing here ? " " Looking for Mommy . " The cross-looking girl is n't much older than Nelly , although she 's dead . She snarls , " You mean the scared lady ? She 's upstairs . " " Betty , shh . " Nelly says , " She said she was n't scared ! " " Well she was , she was bawling when she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " the girl says meanly . " You ca n't go . " " Could too . " She looks at Nelly like she 's the dumbest thing on the playground . " No you could n't , it 's in the rules . You ca n't come visit the dead if you do n't belong to them . " " But it 's my grandparents ! " The girl says scornfully , " That does n't mean anything . They do n't know you . If they did , we 'd know . " " Betty , that 's enough , " the sailor says . Betty sticks her tongue out at him . " We know who belongs and we know who 's connected , and you are n't connected . You have to be connected or you ca n't stay here . " Connected . Like people on a phone line , or Christmas tree lights on a string ? " What do you mean ? " The child gives her a smug grin . " Only family can visit the dead . " The sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're inside you might as well wait with us . Come on , the party 's in full swing . " " But I want Mommy . " " Tough rocks . " " Betty , shh . " " I have to find Mommy . " " I 'm sorry , that 's not allowed , " the lady in the fur coat says . There are diamonds on her fingers and glitter caught in her hair . " She has to find you . " This is so terrifying that Nelly dodges like a cornered fox and runs for the stairs . Nobody follows , maybe because nobody cares . At the top of the stairway she stands in the well of dust spinning under the skylight and waits . Mommy must be up here somewhere , at the end of the main hall or behind one of these closed doors . Some are hung with wreaths like the one Mommy brought attached to the knockers , or American flags or sprays of withered flowers on the sills . She 's got to be behind one of these doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mommy ? " she calls , but not so loud that the dead will come out and chase her away . " Mom ? " Nothing . Gramma Cornwall ? Granddaddy ? She sends their names out in thought waves , but nothing comes back . " Anybody ? " A thought wave rolls in . Go away , little girl . We 're dead . If those people downstairs are dead and everybody up here 's dead , what 's happening to Mommy anyway , Nelly wonders , and what 's going to happen to her ? If this was TV it would turn out I was already dead . She and Mommy could forget about their old lives in New Jersey and where they 'll stay since Glory did n't have enough room . There 's plenty of room here . If she and Mommy were dead , Mommy would stop crying for good ; they 'd never have to worry about new clothes or getting enough to eat . They could write off Mommy 's bad bills and forget Hal and move in and set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standing here in the hall with the sweat running down and her panties riding up in the crack , wondering where in this big old place her mother is and whether she can find her and if she can , how she 's going to get her to leave . She could start by peeking into every room but all the doors are closed and she 's afraid to knock . She could holler but she 's afraid of who may come . She could knock anyway but she 's scared of who 'd come and what they 'd do to her . The dead people are nice enough , she thinks , but what if they hate being interrupted ? What if they have family visiting from the town and the living relatives hate kids ? What if the girl on crutches was right and she does n't belong ? That ugly part of her that thinks too much runs ahead : Maybe you 're here for Mommy because she 's dead . She does n't know what to do . Then she hears laughter from the farthest room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing her mother laugh like that . She has n't been this happy since her last birthday , when Hal bought her the bracelet with the tiny diamond in the middle of a little gold heart . " Mom ? " It 's easy to find the room ; in spite of what she thought the door is open a crack and gold light slants into the hall . For a moment Nelly thinks she 's walked into heaven - Mommy in the rocker beaming happily and two sweet old people beaming back at her from a pink velvet sofa where they sit in white outfits as light and fluffy as clouds . " Lucy , we 're so glad you came . " The sweet old man gives Mommy a smile that would turn anybody into an angel . " Your sister does n't send flowers and she never comes . " Granddaddy ? " Oh , Glory , " Mommy is saying , " she 's a selfish cow . She knew I was hurting and she could n't be bothered , we had to sleep on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " The old lady is laughing a warm and wonderful laugh that fills the room . " Lean Cuisine . " Gramma ? " Oh sweetheart , that 's terrible , we can do better than that , " Nelly 's grandfather says . Her grandmother gets up , laughing , and begins to bustle . " We certainly can . My goodness , Lucy , a girl in your situation deserves better than a bed on the floor and Lean Cuisine . " " She does , " Granddaddy says . Mommy 's voice brightens with hope . " You mean I can stay ? " " You mean you want to ? " The look that crosses Mommy 's face is so happy that it plows into Nelly 's heart like a rock . Mom ! " Yes , " Mommy says . She has decided . " Absolutely yes . " Nelly holds her breath , waiting for her to ask : Nelly too ? But she does n't . She does n't say anything except , " I 'm so glad . " " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Mommy leans in for a group hug and Nelly wants nothing more than to worm her way into the middle of this family tangle , move in and set up housekeeping and never have to leave . And to think they were so mad at Mommy before she came up here and said whatever she said that made them forgive her , and to think she was so scared . Well , she is n't scared now , she is warm and safe and laughing in this pretty , pretty room . The three of them are cuddling and smiling so happily that Nelly 's mouth waters . Me too , Nelly thinks , shuddering . Me too . She 's about to speak when she looks at the table next to Mommy and sees the glass of water and the open bottle of pills . " Mom ! " The hugging stops . Her mother and her grandparents turn . " Nelly ! " her mother says . " Oh , Mommy , pills ! " She grabs the pill bottle and is lunging for the water glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There are n't enough pills there for two . " Then Gramma 's voice hits the air between them and cuts it in two , leaving Nelly and Mommy frozen on one side of the chasm in space , Granddaddy and Gramma on the other side . " Lucille , you never told us you had a child . " Mommy hisses , " Nelly , you ca n't be here . Go away ! " She ca n't help herself ; she starts to bawl . " Mommy , Mom ! " " We ca n't have children here . " Mommy hits a high , anxious note . " But what am I supposed to do with her ? " " You should have thought of that before you defied us with Hal . " " I told you I was sorry . Oh Mother , Father , please ! " Granddaddy says , " You know there are no children here . " Girl on crutches ; Nelly howls , " Are too ! " " Not here here , " Gramma says . " Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Little girl , I 'm sorry , " Granddaddy says . " But you ca n't be here . " Words float into Nelly 's head even though he has n't said them . You have things to do . She turns quickly and catches a smile just as it flies off his face . The gap between them widens ; it is as if the grandparents are on the other half of an ice floe , floating away . Everything in the room has changed . Mommy strains to close the gap but Granddaddy waves her off like a passenger on a boat that 's ready to sail . " I 'm sorry , you ca n't be here either , Lucille . " " Daddy ! " " No . You have responsibilities . " When Mommy turns to Gramma , Gramma waves her off . Nelly ca n't tell whether she is being mean to Mommy because she 's a mean person or whether she 's doing it for Nelly 's own good . " Now , go . " Mother is sobbing . " Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid front , standing at the edge of nothing in their white fluffy clothes . They drift away as something pushes Nelly and her mother backward , toward the door . " Sorry , but in our situation , a kid is only going to get in the way . " Mommy makes a grab for the pills and misses . She is sobbing like a baby . " What am I going to do , what am I going to do ? " " You 'll think of something , " Granddaddy says . The last Nelly sees of her dead grandparents is Granddaddy 's wink . Then she does n't see him anymore . The door closes on an empty room . It takes a while for Mommy to stop crying . Waiting , Nelly studies the other doors . She 'd like to go down to the lobby and find that sailor and the lady who was so nice to her ; she 'd like to have fun at the party before she has to go but she ca n't leave Mommy here . A family - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up the stairs . " Somebody 's coming , " Nelly says , because her mother is still crying . Her mother sobs , " What are we going to do ? " Words kite into Nelly 's head from somewhere else : You 'll think of something . She says , " You 'll think of something , right ? " " I 'll think of something . " Mommy snuffs up the tears and runs her knuckles under her eyes to wipe away the rest . " What , Mommy ? " Nelly is waiting , excited and hopeful . She came this far and got her mother back and if she can just get her moving maybe they 'll find a way to make it through . " What ? " she cries . " Mommy , what ? " " Do n't know yet . " And in the second before the folks from town reach the top of the stairs , Lucille counts on her fingers like a person making a list . She looks up . " But let 's go , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just resolved . On the stairs they brush past a family with a picnic hamper and a floral offering . " Excuse us , " Mommy says quickly , " we 're going now . "
