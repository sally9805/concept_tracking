// Once there were three little pigs who lived in a country with a housing shortage . All the condominiums and apartments had long been occupied , and houses were as rare as dodos . The three little pigs decided to build their own home . But having seen how building a house together had ruined so many relationships all around them , they thought it safer for each to build his own ideal home . This way , each could be creative without the others telling him that his ideas were dumb . Unfortunately , in addition to a severe housing shortage , their country also suffered from an economic recession . There were no more building materials , because the forests had long been cut down and the quarries mined dry . The three little pigs would have to use other materials . The first little pig towed his wagon around every day collecting old newspapers . After a week , he had enough to build himself a house . It was n't the most sturdy of homes , but the first little pig liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evenings and read the walls . One thing he had to be careful about , though , was building fires . He became an expert outdoor chef . // The second little pig collected aluminum cans . He built his home by stacking the cans together . His house was comfortable most of the time except during midday , when it would be as hot as an oven inside . The second little pig did n't mind . He loved the sound of raindrops falling on his tin roof . It made him feel luckier than his brother , whose newspaper house would collapse and have to be rebuilt every time it rained . The third little pig learned from the Indians how to make adobe bricks . For months he labored over making an adobe house . It was the dream house he had always wanted . It shielded him from the hot sun and kept him safe from wind and rain . When he was hungry , he nibbled on the straw sticking out of the wall , tidying his house as he ate . // One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his apartment because he had n't paid the rent for three months , came upon the first little pig 's newspaper house . " Little pig , little pig , let me come in ! " he cried . " Not by the hair of my chinny-chinchin , " the first little pig answered . " Then I 'll huff , and I 'll puff , and I 'll blow your house in ! " So he huffed , and he puffed , and he blew all the newspapers away , exposing the first little pig clutching the sports section to his chest . The first little pig took one look at the wolf and ran . He ran as fast as his four short legs could carry him to his brother 's aluminum house , with the wolf hot on his curly tail . Just in time , he reached his brother 's home , and they slammed in the last few aluminum cans , sealing themselves inside . Now that he had two little pigs instead of one to handle , the wolf cried , " Little pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not by the hair of my chinny-chinchin , " replied the two pigs in unison . " Then I 'll huff , and I 'll puff , and I 'll blow your house in ! " So he huffed , and he puffed , and he scattered the aluminum cans all over the landscape . While the wolf stumbled over the cans , the two little pigs took off like two shots for their brother 's adobe home . // The third little pig was sunning himself outside his adobe home when who should come running along but his two silly brothers who had built paper and aluminum houses . " Oh , darn , " he said to himself . " I knew they would have to move in with me one of these days . But could n't they have waited a bit longer ? " Then , to his surprise , they told him that the wolf was going to eat them all up unless he saved them . They ran inside the house , and the third little pig latched the door . Soon the wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs , little pigs , let me come in ! " " Not by the hair of my chinny-chinchin , " the three little pigs said together . " Then I 'll huff , and I 'll puff , and I 'll blow your house in ! " So the wolf huffed , and he puffed . He huffed , and he puffed again . And again . And again . But he could n't blow that sturdy adobe house down . The three little pigs stood by the window gleefully watching the wolf puffing himself silly . But suddenly , as they watched in horror , the wolf collapsed , clutching his chest . " Oh , no ! " said the first little pig . " What 's wrong with him ? " " I think he 's having a heart attack , " said the second little pig . " We must save him , " said the third little pig . " We ca n't let him die ! " " Save him ? " cried the first and second little pigs together . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives will sue us . Pretty soon , we 'll have every wolf in town knocking on our door . So come on ! " // The three little pigs opened the door and went out to help the wolf . While the first little pig counted , the second and third little pigs performed CPR on the unconscious wolf . After a while , the wolf stirred and sat up . When the three little pigs saw that the wolf had recovered , they made for the safety of the house once more . But before they could slam the door shut , the wolf said , " Why are you afraid of me ? " The three little pigs did a double take . " Pigs are supposed to be afraid of wolves , " they said . " Do n't you want to eat us up ? " The wolf guffawed . " Pork chops ? No thanks , I 'm a vegetarian . " " Oh ? So why were you chasing us and blowing our houses down ? " asked the first little pig . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the wolf . " And I wanted to find out if your house is solid enough for me . I see that this one is . " " If you wanted to move in with us , why did n't you just say so ? " The second little pig threw up his front paws in exasperation . " But I did ! I asked you to let me in , " said the wolf . " You did n't say please . And you should n't have asked so aggressively , " the first little pig rebutted . " He 's right . And you should have said exactly what you meant . You should n't beat around the bush like that , " the second little pig scolded . " All right , all right , " intervened the third little pig . " It 's all a lack of communication . Let 's start all over again , shall we ? " He turned to the wolf . " Now say your line . " The wolf cleared his throat and said solemnly . " Little pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He looked around at the three little pigs and when they did n't reply , he added , " Please ? " The three little pigs nodded . So the wolf and the first two little pigs helped the third little pig remodel the adobe house so that there was room for all of them . They learned the importance of cooperation and communication , and they all lived together happily ever after . <p>
