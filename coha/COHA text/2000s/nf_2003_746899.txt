Section : FEATURES Introduction <p> The 67th NEHA Annual Educational Conference ( AEC ) was held in Reno , Nevada , from June 8 through 11 , 2003 , and it was a tremendous success . Nearly 2,000 people attended , including approximately 1,500 attendees and over 100 exhibitors . Attendees came from as far away as Canada , Ghana , England , Jamaica , and New Zealand . <p> While many attendees commented on the wide variety of entertainment and tourist attractions in the vicinity of the conference , nothing has been the subject of more praise than the quality of the education sessions . Sessions on food safety , indoor air quality , onsite waste-water , and chemical and bioterrorism were well attended . <p> We note with appreciation that this year , the level of attendee feedback was the highest it has been for any AEC . The valuable comments we received challenge NEHA to raise the bar in advancing the educational needs of the environmental health and protection professional . One attendee stated , " The information available at this conference would take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a must for any public health professional . " <p> NEHA strives to present a broad array of educational activities and learning tools to meet the needs of all conference attendees . Following are highlights of this year 's conference . Opening Ceremony and Keynote Address <p> The opening ceremony and keynote address started with presentation of the colors by the Nevada Army National Guard . The soldiers wore their battle dress uniforms , instead of Class A Uniforms , to show support for soldiers participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom . NEHA President Jim Dingman welcomed everyone to the conference , and NEHA President-Elect Doug Ebelherr offered the invocation and asked for special prayers for our military . Recognition was given to conference attendees from around the world , including attendees from Australia , Canada , England , New Zealand , and Ghana , as well as to new NEHA members and first-time AEC attendees . Sponsors were recognized for their generous support of both the keynote address and the conference as a whole . <p> The awards presentation preceded the keynote address this year . For a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> President Dingman then introduced the keynote speaker , Dr. Patrick Meehan . Meehan represents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) at its highest levels , and NEHA was honored to have him speak in Julie Gerberdings stead . He has been a longtime friend of public and environmental health . Within hours of the September 11 attacks he was on the ground in New York representing CDC and administering the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile program , for which he was responsible . More recently , he has played a prominent role in the development of CDC 's national strategy to revitalize environmental health in our country . <p> Meehan has been the director of the Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services since October 2000 . Before that , he was director of the East Metro Health District in Georgia , serving as county health officer and chief executive for three counties with a total population of nearly 700,000 . Meehan had previously been director of the Georgia Division of Public Health , Department of Human Resources , for over three years and was director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1991 until May of 1994 . He has completed a preventive medicine residency and the Epidemic Intelligence Service Program with CDC , and is a board-certified family practitioner . His publications address suicide epidemiology , violence epidemiology , foodborne illness , vectorborne illness , vectorborne viral diseases , and surveillance . <p> Meehan began his address by outlining the four areas he planned on discussing - traditional and emerging environmental public health problems facing the profession , special qualities that practitioners contribute to the solutions , why environmental public health is facing a crisis , and seven ideas for addressing the crisis . <p> He highlighted some of the great accomplishments of environmental public health services , including the reduction of diseases , the increase in life expectancy , and the capacity to " think outside the box " and confront new and emerging problems in public health . Without a return to basic sanitation and public health principles , the future of environmental health could include tasks such as disinfecting the streets to contain and interrupt outbreaks like the SARS epidemic . Meehan stressed that the root of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the time of environmental health professionals would be better spent educating the public than disinfecting streets . <p> A few examples of future issues facing environmental public health include emergency response , lead-based paint in housing , mold , and land use planning . Emergency response for environmental and public health professions will include worker protection , assessment of environmental exposure , and determining effects on groundwater and food supply . Lead-based paint in housing is already being addressed by public health professionals ; however , Meehan foresees that the emphasis in this area will in the future be on identifying and remediating lead exposure risks in existing housing , rather than on testing every child for exposure . Efforts to define the human health effects caused by mold exposure will continue , and health departments will be increasingly burdened by interpreting data on mold exposure and health effects . Finally , Dr. Meehan highlighted land use planning issues , including the increasing number of parking lots , strip malls , and concrete corridors ; while their net effect on the environmental is ill defined , he suggested it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including foodborne disease and rodent/vector control , will continue into the future and will grow more complex as they evolve . Meehan said that the vast majority of foodborne illnesses continue to be underreported and that the West Nile Virus is an example of a complex vector control and habitation-related issue . The re-emerging rodent problem and the issues surrounding brownfields development will both serve as markers of larger urban environmental health problems . <p> After presenting the issues lacing environmental public health , Meehan went on to explain the unique set of problem-solving skills that environmental health practitioners apply to these issues , including a systems approach to problem solving . The systems approach looks at the entire process involved in making it possible for someone to be exposed to a hazard . It also looks at all the factors in the process , including people , equipment , wages , and the process itself . The traditional environmental health philosophy is based on the agent-host relationship , but when the systems approach is applied , the real issue of why an exposure occurred in the first place can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition to problem-solving skills , Meehan discussed the broad and flexible set of skills that environmental health professionals apply . The environmental health workforce , he said , is the flexible workforce of the public health system . The numerous activities that environmental health professionals were involved in following 9/11 serve as examples ; they included incident command systems , syndromic surveillance , worker health and safety , decontamination , the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile Program , and environmental sampling . <p> " Environmental health touches everybody every day , " Meehan said . " Its professionals are the frontline in terrorism defense , working on the security of water and sewage utilities , monitoring the food supply , and detecting naturally occurring and deliberate outbreaks . " <p> Where do the problems lie ? Meehan pointed out that the environmental health workforce is in a crisis , especially with respect to leadership . He feels that environmental health practitioners are not afforded , encouraged , or given the opportunity to get into leadership positions . The public does not understand what they do , and the stakeholders need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good working relationships can be established . The number of environmental health professionals has decreased ; there has been a 42 percent decline in the number of students enrolled in environmental health programs . Also , there is a lack of scientific research to support the decisions that environmental health professionals must make . In general , environmental health is outmoded and needs to move into the 21st century in terms of science and leadership . <p> To address these problems , Meehan , his colleagues , and numerous stakeholders have developed a " Strategy to Revitalize Environmental Health Services . " A work group developed the strategy after outlining six major goals over the course of a year : build capacity , support research , foster leadership , communicate and market , develop the workforce , and create strategic partnerships . <p> Meehan said that the strategy will improve environment public health services by preventing environmentally related disease , preparing environmental health staff for new and emerging threats , providing better access to training and information , providing effective analytical tools , creating a core of environmental health leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships . <p> Meehan discussed the initiatives that have or are currently taking place under the strategy guidance . Three states and two local health departments were funded by CDC to establish communities of excellence in environmental public health services . The communities of excellence are building capacity to address new and emerging issues , and to provide distance learning and up-to-date training opportunities . CDC funded eight states on the EHS-NET food safety initiative , and two cities ( New York and Philadelphia ) were funded for commensal rodent control programs . In addition , CDC has been working with the National Association of County and City Health Officials on the Protocol for Assessing Community Excellence in Environmental Health ( PACE-EH ) . PACEEH is a collaborative , community-based project that allows communities to prioritize environmental health issues on the basis of public values . Finally , the Environmental Health Competency Project was funded to define non-technical competencies for the environmental public health workforce . <p> Meehan concluded by thanking the audience and expressing his pleasure in speaking with the second biggest cadre of public health practitioners - environmental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meehan and introduced Jim Henderson from the Anchorage Convention Bureau , to talk about Anchorage , Alaska , the site of NEHAs 2004 AEC . <p> Mr. Henderson 's enthusiasm excited the crowd ; he told everyone that there are only two types of people - those who want to go to Alaska and those who want to go back . Henderson advised his listeners that when making plans to attend the NEHA AEC next May , they should plan ahead , plan extra time to see all the Alaska has to offer , and plan to bring the family !

This one-day session was made possible through the efforts of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) , CDC , and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . Attendees acquired knowledge on " a topic that is gaining momentum . " The feedback was positive , with comments such as " This was the most informative one day of any conference I have attended " and " We need more educational sessions like this . " NEHA is looking to expand upon this topic in the future . <p> The Chemical and Bioterrorism Preparedness educational track continues to be in demand and well attended because of the ever-growing issues and responsibilities that environmental health professionals are encountering in this area and because of the need for education . Workshops such as the Public Health Agency Role in Incident Command Systems ( ICS ) and Nuclear , Biological and Chemical ( NEC ) Terrorism Planning offered attendees a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only place where valuable information was offered . Several pre-conference workshops were given , along with review courses and exams for the Certified Food Safety Professional and the Registered Environmental Health Specialist/Registered Sanitarian credentials . Attendees were also able get to a glimpse of future environmental health professionals through the undergraduate and graduate student research and poster presentations . <p> Educational sessions at the AEC are made possible through the hard work and dedication of the association 's technical section chairs . These individuals are responsible for creating the sessions by assembling speakers to present on relevant topics - the topics you tell us you want to learn about - within their respective areas of expertise .

In the congenial setting of a buffet luncheon , where tables are set with placards indicating areas of environmental health expertise , attendees can easily identify professionals of specific disciplines to mingle with while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silent Auction <p> In a busy , activity-filled exhibit hall , AEC attendees still found time to make their way to an item-filled silent auction booth . Here , they carefully evaluated the many gifts donated by others and determined which jewelry to purchase , how much a child ( or adult ) would appreciate a puppet of a timber wolf , what foods could serve as a special meal , and how badly they wanted to attend AEC 2004 in Alaska . In the past , a lot of bidding was done earlier in the auction , but this year the old-timers kept saying , " I 'm just looking now . I 'll bid just before the auction ends . " <p> A few items always garner the most attention , and this year was no exception . Most popular in terms of number of bids was National Capital 's U.S. flag , which was flown over the Capitol on June 2 , just days before the auction . A very determined Vince Radke won the flag for $150 , paying more than twice its value . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " Johnny " talking soap dispenser from the exhibitors at " Handwashing for Life . " This year , two dispensers were again donated and were popular items . <p> In second place in the bidding wars were a Sony Digital Camera and Memory Stick from the industry affiliate . Close behind were a 40-year-old Navajo necklace from the collection of Nevada member Shannon Swann and a sapphire necklace handcrafted in Montana . <p> Other popular items at this year 's auction were an Alaskan spirit mask , Omaha steaks from Nebraska , and duck decoys from Bundy in Indiana and from Paul Weber in North Carolina .

Only one stroke separated all of the teams that participated . The winners were declared through a tiebreaker : Elwin Coll , Tom Hatfield , Larry Yates , and Dale Nagata . President 's Banquet <p> At each AEC , the Presidents Banquet , a semi-formal occasion of dinner and celebration , is the final networking and social event . The official transfer of NEHAs presidency takes place , the Mangold Award is presented , and sabbatical-exchange participants are recognized . Events got under way with a video that paid tribute to the environmental health profession and highlighted some of NEHAs members . <p> President Dingman recognized Steve Konkel , who will be going to England , and Sara Forstring , who will be going to Canada , on exchange sabbaticals sponsored by NEHA , UE , and NST . <p> David McSwane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented Earry Eils from Illinois with the 2003 Walter S. Mangold award , NEHAs highest honor . Mr. Eils accepted the award and gave particular acknowledgement to Herb Ripley , his boss at his first job in Waukesha , Wisconsin . Mr. Ripley encouraged Larry to pursue an advanced degree and taught him the importance of Grafting a succinct business letter . <p> Eils encouraged environmental health professionals to get involved through NEHA and stale affiliates and set an example by running for political office , joining a committee , or volunteering . By joining the political process , environmental health professionals can get to know the people who control the purse strings . Eils also suggested supporting the media , stating that the media can , in turn , support environmental health . He concluded his acceptance speech by recognizing his wife of 40 years , Marsha , and thanking her for her tireless support as proofreader and sounding board . <p> Jim Dingman gave a farewell speech and noted that it seemed like just yesterday when he accepted the position of president . He stated that he had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to increase visibility with federal agencies , and to strengthen the credentialing program . NEHA made substantive progress on educational programs in epidemiology , indoor air quality radon , counterterrorism , and onsite waste-water , as well as on the Tools for School program . " We are now at the table with the feds in Washington and Atlanta , " he said . Also , Dingman said , NEHA was in the final stages of negotiating a Washington presence through collaboration with former regional vice president Larry Yates .
