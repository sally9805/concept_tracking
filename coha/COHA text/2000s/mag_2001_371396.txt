The New Age of Terror <P> Re The reports of people bracing for a terrorist attack AMERICA ON GUARD , Oct. 8 : A waitress at my local diner had a Middle Eastern man escorted out because he made her uncomfortable . Listening to the radio , I heard a woman say she is going to buy an expensive couch because it 's the only way she knows how to help the country . I believe the U.S. has become a nation of idiots . Gas masks wo n't help , nor will flying that American flag you just bought . We must concentrate on peace , love and equality . STELLA BLUE Chicago <P> I took comfort in reading about the extreme difficulties of using chemical or biological weapons in an attack on the public . But I keep thinking of how a similarly reassuring article describing the unlikely odds of simultaneous , multiple-airplane hijackings could have been written just a few short weeks ago . There is one inescapable fact we all must take away from the events of Sept. 11 : if something can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARVER Long Beach , Calif . <P> More people are reaching out to friends and family , singing patriotic songs , giving money , donating blood , praying and doing anything possible to help others . That it took a tragedy for people to forget themselves and remember family , freedom and God is a sad commentary on Americans . Maybe we have learned something from this . Do I want to return to the selfishness and complacency of a " normal " life ? No ! MINDY CARLSON Provo , Utah <P> If Americans are serious about shopping for protection , they should contribute to the congressional leaders who call for strengthening the U.N . and oppose U.S. covert operations that cause damage in the Muslim world . When the U.S. consistently demonstrates a foreign policy commitment to universal human rights instead of its own short-term interests , Americans will no longer need to purchase security . " Liberty and justice for all " is n't supposed to be limited to U.S. citizens . VIVIANA GEORGESCU Chantilly , Va . <P>  --  Our reporting on gas masks , vaccines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily to people 's jitters about biological attacks . " Not only are you helping fuel hysteria , " complained a Wisconsin man , " but you are promoting the flawed logic that if you have enough money , you can keep your family safe . " From San Antonio , a Texan warned , " Sensational journalism does little more than cause inevitable panic buying and doomsday fears . " A Nebraskan declared , " Gas masks wo n't help against an anthrax attack , " and urged TIME to " stop scaring people and tell us how to protect the country . " And a reader from Maine imagined " the terrorists laughing their heads off as Americans frantically wave the flag and shop for gas masks . We should thumb our nose at these criminals and get back to everyday life . " <P> Security vs . Liberty <P> I was appalled that 31% of those surveyed in a TIME/CNN poll favored holding American citizens in camps solely because they happen to be of Arab descent AMERICA ON GUARD , Oct. 8 . That is blatant racism at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi Germany ? The Constitution guarantees us certain rights , such as a speedy trial , security from unreasonable searches and seizures and so forth . We can not allow terrorists  --  or our own government  --  to take away those rights . If that happens , the terrorists win . EDUARDO GONZALES Bailey , Colo.
