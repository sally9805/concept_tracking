<p> THE ultimate account of what happened when the mostly white Duke University lacrosse team hired black exotic dancers for a party last month remains to be established . <p> One of the women has accused three white team members of forcing her into a bathroom and sexually assaulting her . She has also complained of racial insults . The three co-captains who hosted the March 13 party at an off-campus house and lawyers for many of the 40 or so players who attended the party have denied that any sexual assault occurred . Initial DNA tests have failed to link any of the athletes to the accuser . But two players were arrested Tuesday on charges of rape and kidnapping . <p> The New York Times takes special care in dealing with accusers when sex crimes are the issue . The paper does not name accusers , its style guide says , except in " rare circumstances . " And every decision about whether to reveal or shield an accuser 's name must be discussed with a top editor . <p> So without naming the accuser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault  --  an always sensitive subject that is further complicated in this case by issues of race , class and politics  --  with a front-page article on March 29 . The paper has published more than 20 stories in its continuing coverage . The dozen or so thoughtful messages I have received on this subject from readers have mostly complained of unfairness to Duke and the lacrosse players . <p> Based on the close look I have given The Times 's coverage in response to these messages , the soundness of the news judgment reflected in the paper 's performance so far deserves a decent grade . The coverage has been basically fair , I think , with a few miscues mainly related to the placement and the space given articles . <p> " I 'm very comfortable with our coverage , " said Tom Jolly , the sports editor , whose staffers have handled the bulk of the coverage . " From the beginning , we 've felt this story had two main elements : one was the allegation of rape ; the other was the general behavior of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several decisions that shaped The Times 's coverage struck me as well founded . <p> The Times started off boldly with a 1,100-word front-page article , which laid out the woman 's accusations as described in an application for a search warrant as well as the team members ' denials . The placement was controversial , but warranted in my view . Even if the sexual assault charges should completely collapse , the allegations of racial slurs and other questionable behavior by members of a top-ranked athletic team that have been brought to light raise important issues of race and class at a prestigious university . <p> The article 's restrained one-column headline below the fold on Page 1 placed it gently before Times readers who may not visit the sports section regularly . At a time when several other major newspapers left it to brief items inside the sports section , I think The Times performed a service in alerting a broader audience to an important story . <p> Most editors recognize the need to exercise special care in publishing information about a person who claims to be the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual experience or attitudes that could be used to minimize or mitigate an accusation of sexual assault generally should not be published , I think most editors would agree . To help them assess accusations , however , readers deserve to know facts that could affect an accuser 's ability to recall events in certain sexual assault situations . <p> The Times 's decision to publish on April 14 an Associated Press story in which one of the first police officers to see the accuser after the party described her as " just passed-out drunk " met the test for me . The Times 's use of the 370-word A.P . article , which was based on a recording of the police radio traffic in Durham , N.C. , where Duke is located , gave readers relevant information about the accuser . The article included a cautionary note that the description of the accuser 's subsequent medical examination " does not mention her being drunk . " Although the article did n't bring it up and probably should have , there 's always a possibility that the accuser had other medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Several Duke supporters have complained about the attention The Times has given to the criticisms by Michael B. Nifong , the Durham County district attorney , of the refusal of any lacrosse team members to tell investigators what happened at the party . When those supporters stressed that three co-captains had gone to the police station for interviews and even volunteered to take lie-detector tests , it at first left me with some concern about fairness . But I think it has become more apparent , based on the public record , that the players have volunteered little eyewitness information . And that means Selena Roberts , a Times sports columnist , had ample reason for her recent concern about a " code of silence . " <p> Turning to points where The Times could have better served readers , I think fairness suffered a bit when it devoted a 550-word article on April 5 to one lacrosse player 's earlier run-in with the law in Washington , D.C. The article recalled that Collin Finnerty had been charged with assault on Nov. 5 for punching a man who had complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be one of the two players charged Tuesday in the rape case in Durham , the size of the article in early April seemed to make too much of the incident . A paragraph or two in some other early April article on the rape investigation would have been adequate for readers and fairer to Mr. Finnerty , it seems to me . <p> The Finnerty story stands in interesting contrast to The Times 's decision not to publish information about the accuser 's criminal record because senior editors have decided it is n't " germane " to the pending sexual assault case , according to Mr. Jolly . The News and Observer in Raleigh , N.C. , has written about her past arrests . I also think readers deserve to know about her record , but I would favor treating it the same as Mr. Finnerty 's : summarizing it in a paragraph or two for inclusion in some broader article . <p> The possible impact of the political pressures on Mr. Nifong as he deals with the rape accusations could have been explored in more depth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell readers about this strand of the story until the middle of a March 31 article , which noted only that the district attorney was " in a heated race for re-election . " Actually , he was appointed to the post last year , so he is seeking election for the first time against two other candidates in the May 2 Democratic primary that will determine the next district attorney . <p> When The Times got around to a profile of Mr. Nifong on April 12 , it noted that he had assured the audience at a candidate forum at North Carolina Central University , the historically black college where the accuser is a student , that " my presence here means this case is not going away . " The population of Durham is about 45 percent black , and one of the candidates facing Mr. Nifong is black . Whether the political pressures are real or perceived , readers deserved to be alerted much earlier to that aspect of the situation . <p> There is one nit I would pick with a sentence in Ms. Roberts 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a search warrant as if it were somehow a court finding of fact . " According to reported court documents , " Ms. Roberts wrote of the accuser , " she was raped , robbed , strangled and was the victim of a hate crime . " While the wording is technically correct , I fear readers could have easily come away thinking the case was farther down the road than it was . <p> A final thought , based on my review of The Times 's performance : Covering the legal proceedings that seem likely to focus on the extremely serious charges of sexual assault and kidnapping is vital . But the paper needs to keep an eye on the allegations and reports about the racial insults voiced by various players , and on the lacrosse team 's seemingly flawed culture . If the rape and kidnapping charges do not hold up , the story does n't end . The Times should be prepared to continue covering what is done about the racial-insult allegations , given the prominence of the team and the university . <p> URL : http @ @
