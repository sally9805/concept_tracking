<p> MOVIE PREVIEW <p> " The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King " <p> Starring Viggo Mortensen , Ian McKellen , Elijah Wood and Sean Astin . Co-written and directed by Peter Jackson . Rated PG-13 for intense epic battle sequences and frightening images . Starts Wednesday in metro theaters. 3 hours , 12 minutes . <p> Los Angeles  --  It 's so easy now . What with the first two " The Lord of the Rings " movies having raked in $1.78 billion at box offices worldwide and the third , " The Return of the King , " the final installment in Peter Jackson 's miraculous J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy , set to officially debut on Wednesday . The new film is expected to tally at least a billion dollars more . <p> It 's just so easy now . Jackson , the sultan of cinema 's Middle Earth , is propped up on a cushiony club chair beneath a beige canopy . He 's sitting inside a gigantic white tent that New Line Cinema erected on the grounds of Los Angeles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jackson , the Kiwi from New Zealand who says he has more in common with hobbits than humans , might not look Hollywood , but on this day he owns this town . He 's pushed a plus-size golf shirt over his bowlful-of-jelly belly . He 's wearing the same shorts he had on two days ago when he met dozens of newspaper , Internet and radio reporters at a Beverly Hills hotel to promote " The Return of the King . " The long curly black hair that looks like it 's never met a comb is , as always , tousled , framing Jackson 's chubby face and marking him , at age 42 , as the cherub who never grew up . <p> The telltale sign that everything here is going Jackson 's way ? Just like when he 's at home or often at work in Wellington , New Zealand , his feet are completely free of socks and shoes . He 's laying bare 10 thick toes to wiggle at the world . <p> " Pete 's a very confident person even though he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Boyd , who portrays the hobbit Pippin . " Do n't let that fool you . One of the main reasons the trilogy got made is that he can make decision after decision all day every day . " <p> " Rings " fans are surely expecting a lot with " The Return of the King , " and Jackson quickly reveals what they 'll get . <p> " They get the ending , " he says with a smile . " I actually think the third one is just about the story racing toward its climax . All the characters in some respects are having to sacrifice part of themselves to help their friends . I wanted to finish it in a way that felt absolutely like it was the end , that it was the final chapter and there was no more . " <p> There will indeed be no more " Rings " beyond " King , " but at a whopping 3 hours and 12 minutes ( not counting the credits ) , the film is packed with the kind of imagination , spectacle and drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilogy . <p> The battles are bigger , longer and more brutal than moviegoers experienced in " The Two Towers , " the treachery more vile from the groundbreaking computer-driven character Gollum ( voiced by Andy Serkis ) and the heroic action more grand than previously seen from characters like Legolas ( Orlando Bloom ) . There is magisterial screen time with Aragorn ( the film 's title character played by Viggo Mortensen ) and more urgency in the perilous trek of ringbearer Frodo ( Elijah Wood ) and his ever-sturdy companion Sam ( Sean Astin ) . There 's a huge spider , armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands , giant creatures , sword-wielding ghosts and ugly orcs . Lots of truly ugly orcs . <p> Australian actor David Wenham , who plays Faramir , accurately dubs the film " gi-normous . " <p> In 2001 , " The Fellowship of the Ring " made $73.1 million in its first five days . Last year , " The Two Towers " earned $101.5 million in the same amount of time . Even with its longer length , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will only open bigger . <p> More than 100,000 fans lined Wellington streets to get a glimpse of Jackson and his stars as they rode in open limos during a parade at the film 's world premiere two weeks ago in New Zealand . <p> Critic David Hunter of the Hollywood Reporter has already proclaimed the film " masterfully entertaining " and " a breathtaking argument for director Peter Jackson winning every award there is to give . " <p> Opening week will indeed be big . On Thursday , one day after " The Return of the King " debuts , nominations for the Golden Globes , handed out annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , will be announced . Jackson was a best director nominee the past two years for " The Fellowship of the Ring " and " The Two Towers . " In Hollywood , the buzz is that it would be unfathomable for him not to get a third nomination for " King . " He 's also considered a shoo-in for multiple Oscar nominations ( best picture , director and screenplay adaptation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not too many years ago , though , it just was n't this easy . <p> What seems now like the most sensible filmmaking decision of the past decade was , at its genesis , the joke of Hollywood . <p> " At the time , it was regarded as the end of New Line , " says Jonathan Rys Davies , who plays " Rings " fighting dwarf Gimli . " The word was that they bet the farm and were really going to fall flat on their face by putting all their money into a film in New Zealand by this small-time film director Peter Jackson . " <p> Before New Line stepped up to the plate , Jackson was developing " Rings " with Miramax and its chief Harvey Weinstein , who ultimately decided he was really interested in making only one film , not three . So Jackson was then able to shop it to New Line . <p> " Obviously the industry had all sorts of questions but I never got doubt and suspicion from New Line , " Jackson says . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they felt New Zealand was going to be the cheapest place to make them so they were going to get a better deal for their money . More of their $300 million was going to end up on screen . " <p> He also praises New Line for making a bold move . <p> In 2001 , when " The Fellowship of the Ring " was to be released in December , New Line ordered a 20-minute cut to screen at the Cannes Film Festival in May . <p> " That 's a real gutsy decision , because how do you impress people with 20 minutes of a movie ? " Jackson says . " And if they are unimpressed then all it would do is feed more fuel of doubt into the industry . In hindsight , it worked out incredibly well . " <p> If Jackson had personal doubts , they came in late 2000 as he was nearing the end of principal photography on all three films . He shot at least 12 hours a day , five days a week for 15 months . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tired , " he says . " My mental capacity was shrinking down . I could n't multitask . Physically I was able to go on day after day . But mentally I found my imagination was sort of drying up . I was worried . I would show up on set , and I was struggling to be imaginative with the camera . I felt like I was just shutting down . " <p> He did what comes naturally to someone obsessed with films . He watched movies . <p> " On the weekends I put on ' JFK , " Goodfellas , " Casino , " Saving Private Ryan , ' " Jackson recalls . " I wanted movies where the directing was flamboyant , where directors are using every trick in the book and their imagination . I just watched films that are dynamic . And I 'd think , ' OK , I know what I have to do now . ' " <p> The cast and crew were completely unaware of Jackson 's exhaustion . <p> " You would never know , " Wenham says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 14-hour days and then watching dailies for like five hours and get a few hours sleep and he 'd show up fresh and sprightly , full of energy and very much into what he was going to achieve that day . You 'd think , ' God almighty , how does this man just keep going ? ' He could control everything . " <p> No glamour-puss <p> Jackson is an atypical worldwide film-industry phenomenon . Few celebrities look as out of place on a red carpet . Even flamboyant stars like Johnny Depp and Jack Nicholson show up for interviews in public settings with footwear . <p> Marty Walsh , the first assistant director of the " Rings " miniatures unit , has known Jackson for at least 15 years and says he has only heard him swear once . <p> Trilogy co-writer Philippa Boyens laughs while relating the story of Jackson 's failed attempt to hide out from fans . <p> " He tried to disguise himself in England , " she says . " He changed the shape of his glasses and put a hat on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hair sticking out from under the hat , and the glasses were just a different round shape . And I said , ' Dude , completely recognizable . ' And he was like , ' No , no , no . Nobody will recognize me . ' " <p> Jackson may be naive or simply uninterested in Hollywood glamour but ask him a question , say , about the pressures of making his trilogy , and he 'll launch into a complex 640-word answer . Or if you ask why he decided to begin " The Return of the King " with a flashback of Smeagol finding the ring and eventually transforming into Gollum , he 'll reply with 479 words that weave through every aspect of his decision . <p> He 's also obviously thought a lot about what making this trilogy has meant to him . <p> " I 'm sort of aware that these three films are going to stand as the accomplishment of my career , " Jackson says . " I 'm never going to shoot three movies again at the same time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful and popular as these films . Which is fine . I am very comfortable with that . <p> " Every filmmaker dreams of making a successful movie both critically and box-office-wise , and I 've made mine . I 'm happy now to have that pressure taken away from me . So I 'm not going to allow the rest of my career to be a miserable one where I 'm trying to top ' Lord of the Rings . ' There are other movies around . " <p> Like " King Kong " with Naomi Watts . In August , Jackson will start filming for New Line a remake of the classic 1933 big-ape movie that inspired him in his youth to become a filmmaker . <p> His task is to re-envision a timeless classic . He must deliver a computer-generated Kong that 's 25 feet tall , looks even more believable than Gollum and , at the same time , evokes as much emotion without being able to speak . <p> Really , it 's as easy as that . <p> * Coming Tuesday in Living : AJC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King , " first shown publicly at just past midnight that night . <p> * Coming Friday in Movies &; More : An interview with actor Viggo Mortensen . <p> * Born : Oct. 31 , 1961 . <p> * Worth seeing on video or DVD : " The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers " ( 2002 ) , " The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " ( 2001 ) , " The Frighteners " ( 1996 ) , " Heavenly Creatures " ( 1994 ) , " Meet the Feebles " ( 1989 ) . <p> * Honors : Five Oscar nominations involving " The Two Towers " ( best picture ) , " The Fellowship of the Ring " ( picture , director , adapted screenplay ) and " Heavenly Creatures " ( original screenplay ) . <p> * Family : Lives with longtime companion and filmmaking partner Frances Walsh .

So it certainly is our hope that we get some of them in ' Kong . ' And if not ' Kong ' then something after ' Kong . ' " <p> * On considering doing another J.R.R. Tolkien adaptation : " People keep asking me if I would do ' The Hobbit , ' but New Line has some problems with the rights . There 's some historical thing going back to the 1970s so it would be some very clever legal discussions between New Line and United Artists , as far as I 'm aware .
