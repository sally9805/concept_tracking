Grandmother Hudson sat there with an I-told-you-so smile on her face at the breakfast table after I returned from speaking with my mother on the phone . " Well ? " she asked when I sat in silence . I knew she wanted to hear she had been right . Spitefully , I wanted to keep her waiting . Actually , my reluctance to speak was more out of my own pain . No matter how brave a face I put on , I was still disappointed . " She 's not coming , " I said quickly , my eyes downcast . " She says the attorney general is having them over for dinner . I 'm supposed to call her if you dare make plans to go with me to England . " " I should go just for that , " Grandmother Hudson said like a petulant little girl . " Have you packed everything ? " " Yes . " She slid a long white envelope over the table to me . " What 's this ? " " Extra spending money . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . It 's a bank draft , so soon after you arrive , ask Leonora to direct you to her bank and have it deposited . You know , of course , all the money will be changed to English pounds ? " " Yes . " " You 'll have to learn the exchange rate so you understand what things will cost . Of course you 'll speak the same language , " she continued , " but there are many differences . My sister has become an Anglophile . She has an accent and all , although there were times even recently when I caught her sounding more like an American . It will take a little getting used to , but that will be part of the adventure . " She paused , sat back and sighed . " I wish I was your age , going off somewhere . I feel like I 've been chained to this chair and imprisoned by my own traitorous heart , " she moaned . " You 've told me many times that you did a great deal of traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I reminded her . " Yes , we did travel quite often until Everett became ill . " She paused , looking thoughtful for a moment and then smirked at me . " No one told you that you have to memorize every last word I utter in this house and then throw them back at me . " I laughed at her and she smiled , wagging her head . Then she grew serious again . " I should tell you a little about my sister Leonora and her husband Richard , " she said sitting forward . " You already know he is a barrister , and Leonora will be the first to tell you how important he is . They live in a fancy part of London , Holland Park . I 've actually only been there twice , once for a visit and once ... for a funeral . " " Funeral ? " " They lost their only child Heather . She was seven at the time . " " How horrible . How did she die ? " " She was born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . One morning , they found she 'd died in her sleep . It was very sad . " " What did you tell your sister about me ? " I asked . " What everyone else believes . It 's better for us to leave it that way . My sister is n't as liberal minded as I am . For now , she thinks you 're going there to live and help with the domestic chores while you attend the drama school . Since they have a maid , a cook , a butler and a chauffeur , I 'm sure there wo n't be all that much for you to do . She 's certainly not going to give up her maid and assign her duties to you . Having a team of servants is too much of a status symbol to Leonora . " " I 'm not afraid of hard work , Grandmother . " " I know . " She smiled and then her face turned somber to add , " It 's not the work that will be hard . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't feel you would do well , Rain . Mr. MacWaine will take good care of you , and I do hope to get there myself someday soon , despite my oppressive physician . " I nodded . I really did hope she would . Later in the day while I was writing a letter to Roy , I heard Victoria come into the house . I could always tell when it was Victoria . Her heels tapped down on the tile floor like tiny hammers when she walked . Her steps were deliberate , each one falling with a vengeance . I suppose I could say she did n't walk as much as she marched , her long legs striding forcefully as her bony shoulders turned . I could hear her voice , barely muffled behind Grandmother Hudson 's closed door . " I just learned of the expense of this ridiculous trip to England you 're sponsoring , Mother . On top of it all , you 're sending her first class ? " " You always travel first class , Victoria , " I heard Grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm your daughter . I run the affairs here . I should travel first class . That ... girl is a family disgrace , someone to hide , not blatantly wave about as if we 're all so proud my sister had an illegitimate child with a black man . Daddy would turn over in his grave . He did n't even travel first class ! " " Your father never took advantage of his money . I never understood the reason for making it if you do n't enjoy it , " Grandmother Hudson said calmly . " Exactly my point . She did n't make it , did she ? " " When will you understand that what I do with my money is my business , Victoria ? We 've had this conversation ad nauseam . If you want to be thrifty , be so with your own money and leave me alone . " " I saw how much that school is costing , too , " Victoria said , ignoring Grandmother Hudson 's wishes . " It 's ridiculous to assume she has any talent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbing us . He probably enjoys taking advantage of stupid Americans . " " Are you calling me stupid ? " " It 's not very bright to spend forty thousand dollars on ... on that girl becoming an actress . " " If you 're quite finished ... " " I 'm not finished . I want to know when you 're calling your attorney about the will , Mother . " " I told you what I 've done I will not undo . When you make up your own will , you can leave her out . " " What ? " Victoria 's laugh was more like a thin squeal . " You do n't think I 'll ever include her in my will , do you ? Oh , what 's the use ? I 'm wasting my breath . " " Finally , you say something intelligent . " " Everyone should n't depend on me keeping my mouth shut forever about this , Mother . One of these days ... " " You 'll do nothing , " Grandmother Hudson snapped . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not right and it 's ... unhealthy to be coddling her like this . Megan should be ashamed of what she has done to the rest of us . " It grew quiet and then a few moments later , Victoria emerged from the room and stomped out of the house . I hoped she had marched out of my life . She was so bitter , with her teeth clenched all the time and her eyebrows turned in like someone with a continuous headache . She seemed to take pleasure in nothing . I did n't think she even liked herself , much less me . I imagined she lived in a house without mirrors so she could avoid looking at herself . When I saw Grandmother Hudson later in the day , I did n't mention hearing any of the conversation between her and Victoria . I was sure she wanted me to forget it as quickly as she apparently did . She enjoyed so little in the way of pleasure from her children and grandchildren . It made me reconsider what it means to be rich and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there early the next morning . We had barely finished breakfast when he arrived . After he stepped into the dining room , I realized I rarely , if ever , had seen Jake in the house . Occasionally he would bring in groceries or whatever packages had to be carried , but usually he waited outside by the car . This morning he looked spiffy . His uniform was cleaned and pressed and the brim of his cap glittered in the light of the chandelier . " Morning , ladies , " he declared as he took a tiny bow . " I am here to fetch the princess and her things for her journey to the Old World . " " Do n't make a fool of yourself this early in the morning , Jake Marvin , " Grandmother Hudson warned . She glanced quickly at me and then straightened with a military posture in her chair . " Everything is waiting in her room . " " Thank you , ladies , " he replied with a smile on his lips , pivoted and paraded off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , looking after him with a soft smile on my face . " Yes , well , when you get to London , you 'll see the way a chauffeur is supposed to behave , I 'm sure . My sister wears her servants like ribbons on her chest . They 're all properly uniformed and trained . My brother-in-law runs his home as if it was a Swiss timepiece . They live their lives according to the tick of that grandfather 's clock . The English and their high tea . " When I think of what a dizzy , foolish little girl Leonora was before she went to finishing school and then to England , I marvel at what one 's ego can accomplish , " Grandmother Hudson said . " Do n't you like your sister ? " " Like her ? Of course I do n't like her . I love her as I should love a sister , but we never got along . Now that I think of it , your mother takes after Leonora more than she takes after me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking , " she added . " Are you sure your sister really wants me there ? " I asked , still suspicious about everyone 's motives . " Leonora does n't do anything she does n't want to do , even though she owes me more than she can ever repay . I do n't mean to make her seem unpleasant . I have no doubt you 'll enjoy your stay there and she 'll be able to brag about the great charitable thing she 's doing , and for an American no less ! " We heard Jake carrying my bags down the stairs . Grandmother Hudson glanced at the small clock in her hutch and then looked at me . " You should get yourself ready , " she said in a softer voice . My heart began to thump like a tire that had gone flat . I still could n't believe I was going to be taken to the airport and flown across the ocean . Grandmother Hudson had seen to my passport . Everything had been done . There was nothing left to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good at good-byes , " she said , " but I 'll walk out with you . " " I was hoping you would come along to the airport , " I said . " Oh , I hate that ride . Besides , you have to learn how to be on your own from the get-go , " she added firmly . I swallowed back my anxiety and started out . She was right behind me . Jake stood by the Rolls holding the rear door open for me . His smile glimmered in the morning sunlight . I hesitated on the steps , took a deep breath and started toward the car . Grandmother Hudson followed . When I got to the car , I turned and we looked at each other . I had a sinking feeling in my chest . What if we never saw each other again ? I had said good-bye to too many people this year , I thought . " Are you going to take better care of yourself ? " I asked her . " Do I have a choice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " I replied . " Then you 've answered your own question . Stop worrying about me . I 'm an old lady . Worry about yourself , about becoming someone of whom we would all be proud , including your mama , " she added . It brought a smile to my face . " Thank you . " I glanced at Jake . The way he looked at us made me wonder if he knew more than he pretended to know . Impulsively , I stepped forward and gave Grandmother Hudson a hug . She stiffened as if it was unwelcomed , but in her eyes I saw the softness and affection that had drawn me closer to her all these months . " I was afraid there was nobody in my family with a sense of propriety and the grit to do the right things . Do n't disappoint me , " she said . " I wo n't . " I could n't hide the tears in my eyes . " Good-byes are simply ridiculous , " she muttered , spun around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got into the vehicle and he closed the door . Grandmother Hudson paused at the front door and looked back . I rolled the window down and we just gazed at each other . Then I lifted my hand as Jake started the engine . I waved once . She waved back and we were on our way . She watched us leave and then turned and entered the house . How lonely she was , I thought , despite her brave and blustery act . She should be the one who goes off to drama school , not me . She 's a much better actress . Both her daughters were disappointing to her and she did n't enjoy her grandchildren . Her friends were all society ladies who used her for her charity contributions . Her house was full of echoes , empty voices , dark memories , heavy whispers and heavier music drifting out of windows and caught in the wind . " Do n't worry about our queen , " Jake said . He had been watching me in the rearview mirror . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to see you in short order . " " You ? " I started to laugh , but there was a look on Jake 's face that told me not to underestimate him . " I hope so , Jake , " I said . As we rode to the airport , Jake told me stories of his own travels , filling them with little warnings about people , about scam artists . " Be really careful about who you talk to and never show your money . Never show anyone where you 're keeping it on you , Rain . Just take out a few bucks for gum and magazines and stash the rest safely , hear ? " " Yes , Jake . " " If you take your time and do n't let anyone rush you along , you wo n't make mistakes . When you 're in a strange place , it 's always better to listen first and talk last . " " All right , Jake . " " Just go directly to your boarding gate and wait with your carry-on luggage right by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'll be some creep ready to scoop it up . The airports are full of parasites who hang around just looking for someone like yourself who looks green . " " Me ? Green ? " I started to laugh , but Jake kept a serious expression . " These people are experts , Rain . They know how to tell the difference between a seasoned traveler and an innocent young lady , " he warned sternly . " All right , Jake . I 'll pay attention . " " Good . " " You should have had a dozen daughters , " I told him . He laughed , but I really meant it . Why was it people who did n't want children , who were too selfish to really care for them , were the ones who had them , and people like Jake who were generous and loving at heart went through life alone ? Mama used to live with the deep-set belief that ultimately fairness and right would win out at the end , that there was a good and just superior power taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was there . Poor Mama , I thought . I wonder if she died still believing in good angels or if she had lost her faith in the end and died with disappointment blackening her pure heart . It was n't until the airport came into sight that I realized not only had I not flown overseas , I had never flown anywhere ! I wondered if Jake knew that . " It looks so busy , " I commented seeing all the vehicles double-parking , people rushing about , skycaps rolling luggage , shuttle buses winding around cars , policemen screaming at drivers and waving on other cars . I thought it was pure chaos . " What a mess . How does anyone know where to go ? " " This is n't your first airplane ride , is it ? " Jake finally asked . " Yes . " " Oh man , " he said . " All right . Do n't worry about it . You 'll have to check your luggage inside and show them your passport with your ticket . They wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be on your own from the time I let you out . Of course , I could park in the lot and wait with you if you like , " he offered . " I 'll be all right , Jake . Mrs. Hudson told me to be on my own from the get-go . " " She would because she thinks everyone was born with the same steel in her bones , " he muttered . " Victoria was , " I said , thinking that was the best part of Grandmother Hudson to inherit . " Yeah , that she was , " Jake said , concentrating on squeezing the vehicle into an opening . As soon as he did , he stopped and jumped out of the car . He opened my door and went around to the trunk , signaling for a skycap . " She 's going to London , " he told him . He helped load my luggage onto the small wagon and then turned to me . " He 'll take you to the counter , Rain . Everyone will be helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , Jake . " " Well , the queen is right about one thing , " Jake said . " Good-byes suck . " He and I laughed . I hugged him . " Do n't forget to send me pictures of Rain , " I said referring to his colt . " I will . You 'd better get going , Princess , " he said nodding at the terminal . I started away . " Show them English how good you are , " he called . " Okay , Jake . " He held up his hand a moment and then got into the Rolls . " This way , lady , " the skycap told me . I followed him , but I looked back at Jake and the car one last time . I would miss him more than I had dreamed . He had a quiet confidence like someone who knew important things and just stood in the background waiting for you to catch up . Jake had been right about people being helpful . I was told that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge . It was comfortable and the flight attendants were friendly and helpful . One came to tell me when it was time to board . I followed a couple to the gate and boarded the plane . The man sitting beside me was an English businessman . He barely muttered his name and then went back to his paperwork . After the meal and the movie , he fell asleep . I do n't think we spoke more than a dozen words and finally I dozed off myself . It was n't until the pilot announced that our landing was imminent that my English businessman asked me where I was going in London . I told him about the Richard Burbage School of Drama . He raised his eyebrows and nodded softly , which was the extent of his reaction to anything , and then he returned to his paperwork . Were all Englishmen this reserved ? I wondered . I 'll be talking to myself most of the time . After we landed and were herded through customs , I saw a stout man with a square jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my name printed in large block letters . He was in a dark blue chauffeur 's uniform with little gold epaulets on his shoulders , which were as thick and wide as his neck . He looked like a wrestler who had been asked to don a servant 's outfit . All of his facial features were harsh , especially his mouth because of the way his lower lip curled out a little . " I 'm Rain Arnold , " I said stepping up to him . He looked me over as if he was deciding whether or not to believe me . He did n't smile or even grimace , but his eyes darkened and he thrust his hand out as if his arm was a steel coil , grasping my carry-on . " I 'm Boggs , " he finally said . " Mrs. Endfield will be waitin ' in the car . Follow me to the luggage carousel , " he ordered . " All right , " I said , but he did n't wait for my response . He pivoted and started away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked with his head straight , eyes forward , never turning to see if I was following behind him . I could barely keep my eyes in my head . Everywhere around me people were talking in foreign languages . I saw Arabs in their national dress , people from Africa with their heads wrapped in colorful turbans , people from India , and hundreds of Orientals as well as businessmen of all nationalities walking quickly and carrying briefcases . Not in my wildest fantasies did I imagine that a girl like me , coming from where I came from , would have this opportunity . Maybe I really was caught up in the babbling brook of destiny , swept along by forces I could n't begin to understand . Mama , I thought , would n't your eyes bulge too at the sounds and sights here . When we arrived at the luggage carousel , Boggs put my carry-on down and finally turned to me . " Point out yer pieces , " he commanded . " Pardon me ? " " Yer luggage . How many pieces ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's one ! " I cried pointing . He grabbed at it and picked it up with such ease , I thought someone might have emptied it and stolen my clothes . After we retrieved the others , he gathered them under his arms and in his hands , nodding at my carry-on . " You take that , " he ordered . Again , I practically had to jog to keep up with him . He led me down the walkway toward an older looking , but well-kept Rolls-Royce . Before he opened the trunk , he opened the rear door and I peered in . There was my Great-aunt Leonora sitting in the far corner . She had a much thinner face than Grandmother Hudson , but I saw the similarity in her eyes and nose . Her dark brown hair was styled with a sweep over the left side of her forehead . Every strand looked pasted in place forever . She wore a gray tweed suit and pretty gold earrings spotted with tiny rubies . I saw she wore a great deal more makeup than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Welcome to London , dear , " she said . " Get in quickly and while Boggs is putting your luggage in the boot , tell me how my sister is managing herself . " " Thank you , " I said slipping into the car . Boggs closed the door and opened the car trunk . As soon as I sat , my nostrils immediately filled with the scent of her pungently sweet perfume . I nearly choked on the overwhelming waves of it . In the semi-darkness I saw that my aunt had small brown spots on the right side of her jaw . " Mrs. Hudson wanted me to tell you how sorry she was that she could n't come over with me right now . Her doctors want to monitor her pacemaker a little longer . " " She must be furious . I know my sister Frances . You do n't tell her not to go somewhere , " Leonora said . " How was your trip ? " " It was fine . " " First time abroad , is it ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet you 're all excited about attending the school of drama . What a wonderful opportunity . I never would have thought my sister capable of such an enormous altruistic act . I know she is involved in this charity and that , but becoming someone 's guardian so late in life is quite a responsibility . " She tilted her head a bit to look at me . " I wonder from where she got this sudden , new motherly impulse ? What have you done to charm my sister so ? " she asked . There was a strange note of suspicion in her voice as her eyes widened with the question . " I do n't know , " I said . " Mrs. Hudson has been very kind . It 's as simple as that . " " Really ? How interesting , " she continued , still gazing at me with those scrutinizing eyes . " How are my nieces ? " she followed . " Fine , I guess . I do n't see all that much of them , " I added quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be put under such a cross-examination so quickly . " Victoria is still not romantically involved with anyone . " " I would n't know , ma'am . " " She 's been around often enough , has n't she ? " " Yes , but not that often , " I said . " Hmm . " She nodded slowly and then smiled . " I bet you 're ravishingly hungry . We can stop along the way and get you some warm food , if you like . I know a nice new French restaurant that 's not far . Do you like French food , dear ? " " I have n't eaten all that much of it , " I said . " Oh ? " " I 'm really not that hungry , " I said . " I ate enough on the plane . I 'm okay . " I wanted to be polite and look at her when she spoke , but I wanted to look out the window , too . Where were the places I had read about in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Parliament , the National Gallery ? " Just yesterday , " she said , " at tea at Lady Bishop 's , I told everyone I was getting an au pair from America . It 's usually just the opposite , " she bragged with a short laugh . " Excuse me ? Au pair ? " " A foreign girl exchanging housework for room and board , " she explained . " Oh . " How strange it was to consider myself a foreign girl , but that 's exactly who I am here , I thought . " When we arrive at Endfield Place , I 'll have Mary Margaret show you to your sleeping quarters , and then you 'll meet Mrs. Chester , our cook . Boggs will describe your duties to you , however . My husband has made Boggs the staff manager . " What do you think of my new hairstyle ? It 's the rage in Paris . See how this side looks like it 's floating ? " She patted the side of her hair softly . " How old are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything . " I 'm eighteen , " I said , smiling to myself at the way she flitted from topic to topic . She reminded me of a hummingbird , buzzing over one flower and then rushing off to the next . It was as if she was afraid of being tied down for even a moment . She was either someone pursued or someone in pursuit , I thought and wondered if I would ever discover which it was . " Eighteen . Yes , it seems like yesterday , " she said wistfully . " Oh , I do hope you do n't smoke , " she said with a firm face of warning . " Richard wo n't permit anyone to light a fag in our home and he can smell it a mile away , so do n't try to sneak one . " " Fag ? " " Yes . " " I do n't understand . What 's a fag ? " I asked . " Oh , it 's what you Americans call a cigarette , " she said , laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are n't you still an American ? " I asked . " Goodness , no . Richard would n't tolerate the idea . " She gazed out the window and then turned back to me . " You 're so lucky . We 're having a week without showers , if you believe what you hear on the telly . " " Telly ? " " The televison set , of course . Richard says Americans ca n't live a day without the telly . I do n't suppose you 're hooked on one of those dreadful soap things , are you ? " " Oh . Television . No , ma'am , I 'm not , " I said . " Good . Just look there , " she said pointing to a woman pushing a shopping cart full of cans and bottles . " I do n't know what this country is coming to these days . I see more and more aluminum miners foraging for recyclables to get food . Dreadful . " " Homeless people , " I said looking back at the woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States . " " Richard just rages and rages about them . He thinks the government should get them off the streets . Just the other day , he met with the P.M. , you know , and gave him a bloody what for . " " Is that the Prime Minister of England ? " " Of course , dear . Now I 'll stop talking and you tell me about yourself . Pretend you 're telling the story of your life . Go on . Where were you born ? " she asked , resting her arms on her lap and sitting back as if I was about to tell her a fairy tale . I started , describing my life in Washington , D.C. , and what it was like growing up there . She listened and then suddenly , she leaned forward and tapped emphatically on the back of the driver 's seat . " Go the long way , Boggs . I 'd like her to see the Gardens . " " Very good , Mrs. Endfield , " he muttered and made a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , I know , " she said . " Frances has n't told you that our **29;703;TOOLONG owned slaves , has she ? " Before I could reply , she shouted , " There ! " and stabbed her finger in front of my face , " Kensington Gardens . Everything is in bloom . " Lady Billings and I are going to sponsor a picnic for the orphans next month . Oh , I believe my sister said you were an orphan now . You must forget all that , my dear . Think of us as your surrogate family until ... until whatever , " she said laughing . " Everyone tells me I could have been an actress . I have the talent for it . Boggs , can you drive a little faster ? I promised Lady Billings I would ring her up this afternoon . " " Very good , Mrs. Endfield , " he said quietly . " You were saying ? " she said , turning back to me and smiling . " Something about your sister Beni , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I knew a Beneatha . Oh yes , that dreadful East Ender who came around with the chimney sweep . Boggs , remember them ? " " Yes , Mrs. Endfield . I do indeed . " " Well , what happened to them ? " " I would n't know , Mrs. Endfield , " Boggs replied . " No , I do n't suppose you would , Boggs . Dreadful people . You could see the soot in the very pores on their faces . " She shook herself as if she had gotten a bad chill . Then she looked at me again and shook her head . " I do n't know why you 're not hungry , my dear . The food they serve on planes is just dreadful . However , Mrs. Chester will have something for you , I 'm sure , even if it 's tea and a fig biscuit . We 're almost home . Endfield Place , " she said grandly as if it was Tara from Gone with the Wind . My head was spinning . A little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was myself . I really began to wonder how Grandmother Hudson and Leonora could be sisters . " This is Holland Park , " she said , " one of the nicest areas of London . My throat 's suddenly so dry . I 'll have a cup of tea myself when we finally get home . Thank goodness , we do n't make the trip to the airport all that much , right Boggs ? " " Yes , indeed , Mrs. Endfield , " he said . He was like a statue  --  never turning his head once during the journey . " Well , in any case , welcome to London , dear , " she said as we turned into a cobblestone driveway toward a very large stone house . As we circled toward the front entrance , I saw what looked like a quaint little cottage behind the house . Well-trimmed hedges lined the front of it with a small walkway in between . It looked like fresh flowers had been planted along the path . The cottage was different , sparkling like new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretty white shutters . I thought it looked more like a dollhouse . " What a pretty cottage , " I remarked . " Who lives in it ? " My Great-aunt Leonora turned slowly to me . Her face had changed , hardened so that her true age seeped out from under the makeup and deepened the crevices in her forehead and the lines at the corners of her mouth and eyes . " No one lives there , " she said . " And no one is ever to go there . " Her voice was deep , almost threatening . Then she smiled and laughed . She was obviously someone who could hop from one emotion to another in an instant . " Welcome to Endfield Place . Welcome to your new home , my dear . " I gazed at the grand house and beautiful grounds . Home , I thought , when will that word have any real meaning for me again ?
