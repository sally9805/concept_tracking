Air Intelligence Agency Headquarters , Lackland Air Force Base , San Antonio , Texas Weeks later " Where is he , Chief ? " Colonel Trevor Griffin , operations officer and acting commander of the 996th Information Warfare Wing of the Air Force Air Intelligence Agency , asked as he hurried through the doors . His excitement was obvious as he waited at the verge of impatience exchanging security badges with the guard , facing a sensor for a biometric face-identification scan , and entering a security code into a keypad to open the outer door . Griffin was a sort of caricature , like a kid wearing his dad 's military uniform  --  short in stature , beanfaced , with slightly protruding ears and narrow , dancing blue eyes . But the broad shoulders , thick neck , and massive forearms under his overcoat only hinted at the soldier hidden behind those giddy eyes . " In the boss 's office , sir , " the command 's Chief Master Sergeant Harold Bayless responded as he met the colonel on the other side of the security barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some paperwork , and he was already here . I buzzed you and the boss as soon as I found out . " " Let me know when the boss gets in , " Griffin said as he removed his Air Force blue overcoat and handed it to the chief master sergeant . " Make sure he has an office , a car , and billeting set up . " " Yes , sir , " Bayless said . Physically , the two men could not have been more different : Bayless was husky and tall , with lots of thick , dark hair and humorless , penetrating dark eyes . Despite their height difference , Bayless had trouble keeping up with the quick full bird  --  Bayless finally had to let Griffin hurry off ahead of him , and he retreated to his own office to make all the appropriate notifications on behalf of this most unexpected distinguished visitor . Despite his fast pace , Griffin was n't even breathing hard as he hurried past the stunned noncommissioned officer in charge and into his office . There , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their unexpected visitor . " General McLanahan ! " Griffin exclaimed . He stood at attention and saluted . " I 'm sorry , sir , but I did n't know you 'd be here so soon . I 'm Trevor Griffin . Good to meet you , sir . " Patrick McLanahan got to his feet , stood at attention , and returned the colonel 's salute . Griffin came over to him and extended his hand , and Patrick shook it . " Good to meet you , too , Colonel Griffin , " Patrick McLanahan responded . " For Christ 's sake , General , please , sit down , " Griffin said , a little confused at McLanahan 's formal bearing . " It 's a pleasure to have you here , sir . Can I get you anything ? Coffee ? " " Coffee is good , thank you . Black , " Patrick said . " Me , too  --  commando style . " Griffin buzzed his clerk , and moments later the man came in with two mugs of coffee . Griffin introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , but I did n't expect you for quite some time  --  in fact , I was only just recently notified that you 'd be joining us , " Griffin said . He stood aside so Patrick could take the commander 's seat , but Patrick reseated himself on the sofa , so Griffin , a little confused , took his armchair at the head of the table . " We 're thrilled to have you take command of the unit . " " Thank you . " Griffin waited until Patrick took a sip of coffee , then said with a smile , " I 'm Trevor  --  or ' Tagger ' to my friends , sir . " " Sure , " Patrick said . " I 'm Patrick . " Griffin nodded happily and took a sip of coffee , still acting as excited as a kid about to go through the turnstiles at Disneyland . " I guess it 's been a while since I 've reported in to a new unit . I 'm a little nervous . " " And I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanfare . " " I 'm no longer a two-star , Tagger . " " It was either a mistake , or a temporary budgetary/billeting/ allotment thing , or somebody 's sending you a pretty strong message , Patrick , " Griffin said , " because the Air Force does n't take away a general 's stars , like you 're some young captain that just got a DUI . If they did , guys like MacArthur and LeMay would 've been buck sergeants in no time . General officers either get promoted or they retire , either voluntarily or involuntarily  --  they do n't get demoted . " He could n't help but stare , bug-eyed , at the ribbons on Patrick 's chest , especially the Air Force Cross  --  the highest award given to an Air Force officer besides the Medal of Honor  --  and the Silver Star . " But whoever 's testing you or pushing on you , " he went on , dragging his attention back to his new commanding officer , " it 's their loss and my gain . But we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to show up early and meet everyone , " Patrick said . " My son is with his aunt in Sacramento . " " And your wife ? " " I 'm a widower , Trevor . " Griffin 's face fell . " Oh , shit ... I 'm sorry , sir , " he said sincerely . He averted his eyes apologetically , embarrassed that he had n't known this extremely important piece of information . " I received your personnel file , but I only glossed over it  --  as I said , I did n't expect you for a few weeks . " This uncomfortable pause gave Patrick a chance to look Trevor Griffin over . His compact frame only served to accentuate his powerful physique  --  he looked as if he had been power-lifting most of his life , and perhaps still did . Griffin 's short-sleeved casual uniform had few accoutrements  --  command jump wings under a senior weapons director 's badge  --  but Patrick saw his Class A uniform hanging on a coatrack behind the door , and it appeared as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have  --  and then some : Patrick noticed a Combat Infantry Badge and even a yellow-and-black ranger tab . " That 's okay , Trevor , " Patrick said . " I guess I 've thrown a monkey wrench into your office by coming here early like this . I 'm sorry . " " We both have to stop saying ' sorry ' to each other . " Patrick smiled and nodded ... Continues ...
