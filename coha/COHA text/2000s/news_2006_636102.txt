<p> We ca n't even agree on the name . What the rest of the world calls football , we call soccer , simply because we already have our football and it reflects America 's desired macho profile of bleeding , crippling physicality . Our soccer is a fringe sport of moms , kids and diehards , contrary to their football , a life-and-death psychosis that can breed hooliganism , suicide and occasional murder if a player heads a ball into his own net . <p> They do n't relate to us , we do n't relate to them . They are on Mars , we are on Pluto . When Bono narrates those cool World Cup promos with accompanying U2 music , we see kids kicking balls and wonder why they are n't throwing or shooting balls . Clearly , the world cares and we do n't , for reasons more political and generational than we 'll ever grasp . The only time your typical SportsCenter " guy has talked soccer is when Brandi Chastain ripped off her shirt , introducing the wonders of the sports bra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest and best kid athletes play football and kids too small generally play soccer , which could be a metaphor for American life . <p> So why even try to be part of the global football culture ? Why force-feed ourselves into an elite party when we do n't have the pedigree or the passion , when we fail to get a buzz over teams squeezing maybe a minute or two of cumulative excitement out of a 90-minute match ? This sports nation in 2006 is about football 's speed and hard knocks , basketball 's speed and creativity , NASCAR 's speed and crashes . If we want to hang out , ponder strategy , drink beer and watch life go by , we attend baseball games and cheer home runs , 1-2-3 innings and catcher-to-catcher knuckle sandwiches . <p> Soccer ? On the food chain , it ranks somewhere above lacrosse and below Sudoku . <p> Our national kickball community , as one radio host dubs it , tried to market the game this month with an unprecedented blitz . It coincided with America 's supposed inroads on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Cup four summers ago  --  do you even remember that happening ?  --  and a blurry No. 5 ranking by the sport 's governing body , FIFA . A sleeping giant , " U.S. coach Bruce Arena called his team , considered our most talented ever . The hype heading into a new World Cup , in Germany , was suffocating . <p> Confusing futbol with football , apparently , ESPN decided to lather the event like the NFL playoffs , complete with studio shows breaking down the daily action . Nike erected huge billboards in New York and other cities with a bold-faced warning  --  BEWARE "  --  which instinctively makes you look skyward in Manhattan for King Kong or aircraft until you see the images of four U.S. soccer players , two of whom I 'm vaguely familiar with . Sports Illustrated placed players on its sacred cover and referred to them by first names and nicknames  --  Beaz , Landon , Gooch and Bobby  --  a quartet that could have been a boy band for all anyone knew . Corporate America was rallying around a cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that ? <p> We were told to wave our flags , flaunt our patriotism and bask in an American soccer renaissance . The Fourth of July was coming , and by golly , our boys were going to race through the first round and force a defining showdown against those grand Brazilians , whose players go by solo names  --  Ronaldhino , Ronaldo , Adriano and , of course , Kaka . Before the first game , President Bush called the boys with an inspirational message . On a June Monday in the USA , people actually took longer lunch breaks to see what all the fuss was about , with 2.14 million households tuning in compared with 998,000 for a similar interval in 2002 . Here we go , laddies , here we go . The Americans were going to silence the Czech Republic and prove their transcendent point . Did somebody actually suggest soccer as our new national pastime as the game started ? <p> Whoever did was sadly mistaken . <p> National waste-of-time , I 'd say . <p> The great soccer salesmanship job turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been compiled by Fifi , as in someone 's dog , because Team USA entered the stadium in Gelsenkirchen and laid one of the all-time stinker eggs in World Cup annals . If the Americans looked scared , disorganized , confused , passive and out of their league , that 's because they would say all those things themselves after a 3-0 loss , keeping in mind that 3-0 in this sport is akin to 49-0 in the NFL . <p> What bothered me most was finger-pointing by Arena , which surely is perceived and ridiculed as ugly Americanism by a world hardly enamored of the U.S. these days . The coach is responsible for a team 's psyche and preparation , especially in an event that comes every four years . But Arena showed the body language of a man so disgusted by the performance that he wished to separate himself from these inferior slugs beneath him . When he was n't shaking his head and looking at the sky , he 'd stare at his players with his hands behind his head . With two games remaining , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how poorly they played . If Arena thinks he 's a tough guy , I 'm here to tell him he 's no Bill Parcells in the cred department . <p> Arena 's shots off the mark <p> He called out forward Landon Donovan , midfielder DaMarcus Beasley , goalie Kasey Keller and others . And while nobody was disputing that everyone played terribly , it 's revealing that some players are questioning Arena 's strategy . Beasley , who needed to be aggressive offensively with a big deficit , wondered why he was placed at right back in the second half . I was back there defending the whole time , " he said . I do n't know what he wants me to do . " <p> At a Wednesday press gathering in Hamburg , midfielder Bobby Convey said some of the players did n't understand their roles . Whose fault is that ? And why did Arena wait so long in Germany before announcing his starting lineup ? <p> Arena has continued to rip away anyway . Of Beasley , he said , If he 's any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he does n't , then he 's not going to be able to help us in Games 2 or 3 , either . " <p> The reason we did n't do well is because everyone did not do their role , maybe did n't know their role and maybe did n't know what to do , " Convey said . <p> Is it possible this team was so absurdly overhyped that expectations rose beyond reality ? Because barring a Saturday miracle against Italy , which never has lost to Team USA , you can say arrivederci to the stateside soccer dream . Why would anyone with a clue think the Americans were ready to break through ? Their World Cup record at European venues is 3-10-1 , and against European competition , they 're 0-8 and have been outscored 23-4 . It can be done , " Arena said . <p> I do n't share his belated optimism . America was n't ready for the elite world stage and probably never will be , at least in our lifetimes . <p> It would be wrong to suggest no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich cities such as Chicago , interest is huge in neighborhoods and bars . But the people who drive this U.S. sports engine needed a specific reason to care . <p> That reason disappeared Monday . Wake me up in four years . <p> On second thought , do n't . <p> Jay Mariotti is a regular on " Around the Horn " at 4 p.m. on ESPN .
