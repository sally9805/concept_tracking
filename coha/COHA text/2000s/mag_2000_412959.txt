Follow master wood-carver Jack Portice 's tips for perfect pieces . BY BUCK TILTON + PHOTOGRAPHS BY BRIAN PAYNE Photograph Photograph Just like tha boys : Master carver Jack Portice demonstrate the craft to Scouts Zach Backes ( left/ and Andy Lingusky. // Jack Portice looks like what he often carves-a mountain man . He 's weathered and strong , with long gray hair and a bushy gray beard . For more than 20 years Mr. Portice has turned what most Scouts would consider firewood into mountain men , Indians , bears , dragons and " bristlechauns . " Bristlechauns ? " Yep , " he says with a merry , Santa Claus twinkle in his eyes , " bristlechauns ; gnomelike relatives of leprechauns . I find them hiding in bristlecone pines . " Bristlecone pines grow only high in the mountains of the West , near the tree line , They may live for thousands of years . That makes them among the oldest Living things on Earth . " Most of the wood I carve has been dead for more than 200 years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead bristlecones is hard , and few carvers use it . Mr. Portice 's bristlecone carvings are sought after by collectors around the world . He has won more than 25 first-place ribbons at woodcarving shows . His small carvings sell for about $50 . His award-winning carvings sell for as much as $7,000 . " Today , " he says to Andy Lingusky , 16 , and Zach Backes , 14 , both Star Scouts in Troop 238 in Bailey , Colo. , " we 're not carving bristlecone . We 're going to be carving aspen . Any idea why ? " " Aspen is easier to carve , " Zach answers . " Right , and I take limbs from standing dead aspen after the bark has started to peel . In the East , the basswood tree carves about the same . " Photograph Zach Backes secures the wood in a vise as he carves his mountain man neckerchief slide .

Whittling There are two ways to sculpt wood . A whittler holds the wood in one hand and makes cuts with a knife . A carver puts the wood in a vise and cuts with many different tools . There are more than 50 cutting tools in Mr. Portice 's tool rack . Some are knives , but most are gouges . Some of these have a round edge , some a V-shaped edge , and some are flat-edged . " I have eight or 10 favorites that I do most of my work with , " Mr. Portice ex plains . " Before we start carving , " he continues , eve need a couple of safety rules . " " Always cut away from yourself , " says Andy . That 's right , " Mr. Portice answers . In carving , as in whittling , the tool is pushed away from the carver . With the wood in a vise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to control the tool . With two hands , you have more control and more power . For additional safety , the Scouts wear a thick glove on the hand not holding the tool , just in case of a slip . " The most important rule for safety and accuracy when carving is keep your tools sharp , " adds Mr. Portice . He stops about every 15 minutes to sharpen his tools on a flat sharpening stone . A sharp tool wo n't skip out of the wood and into the carver 's hand . A sharp tool also cuts more deeply and more precisely than a dull tool . Facing Up Jack Portice lives and works quietly in a house tucked away on the edge of a woods near Fairplay , Colo. , at an altitude above 10,000 feet , not far from the bristlecones he loves . Not far from aspen trees , either . Today the Scouts will carve aspen into neckerchief slide likenesses of mountain men . " Just any old mountain man ? " Zach wants to know . No . Mr. Portice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scouts will use his carving as a guide . " But we do n't expect the carvings to look exactly the same , " he says . " We all have our own technique . " With Mr. Portice keeping close watch and offering helpful suggestions , Andy and Zach dig into the wood . Chips soon litter the studio floor . " Take bold cuts , " he says at one point . " Depth is what makes a good wood carving . " Under Mr. Portice 's careful direction , it takes Andy and Zach about four hours to finish the slides . Their mentor is very pleased with the results . " I 've never seen such fine work from beginners , " he says . The Scouts ' wide smiles speak for themselves . Make a Carving Vise You can build your own vise to help you carve . Simply take a short piece of 1 1/2  --  inch plumbing pipe with a 90-degree elbow . Attach a plumbing flange to both ends . Screw one flange securely to a piece of flat wood . Attach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flange with short screws . Clamp the vise to a table top . Photograph A face in the wood : One of Jack Portice 's intricate designs .
