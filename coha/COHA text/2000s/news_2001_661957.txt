<p> The Cubs had n't won a World Series in a lifetime , but 77-year-old Jim Green indulged in a little optimism as he sat basking in the sun at Wrigley Field . <p> " I do n't give up on the Cubs , " declared the retired banker . " Sometime in the next 100 years , they 're going to win . " <p> But despite their team 's unfamiliar sojourn at the top of the divisional standings in this season 's early months , pessimism comes more naturally to Cubs fans . They are the longest-suffering in a city in which baseball 's White Sox , the NHL 's Blackhawks , even the once-storied Bears of the NFL and Michael Jordan 's gloried NBA Bulls all have fallen on hard times . <p> " We 're never going to see a World Series here , are we ? " Green 's friend Leo Deutsch , 74 , asked with a sigh . <p> But why not ? Why in the name of Sammy Sosa do the Cubs keep falling short year after year ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santo is as stumped as everyone else . <p> " I wish I had the answer , " the ex-third baseman said , raising such possible factors as Wrigley 's winds , the pitcher-hostile conditions and bad luck . " I just think you 've got to be lucky . Timing is everything in life . " <p> Still , he lamented : " I ca n't believe that it 's been 93 years since we won a World Series . " <p> The collective tailspin of Chicago 's teams is a citywide slump for the ages , deeper than anything a Philadelphia , Cleveland or , alas , New York can dredge up from losing years of yore . <p> Chicago , the city of the " El , " has been the city of the " L " in sports-page won-loss columns , especially in the last few years . <p> - 1999 marked the first time that all the major teams finished with losing records . Only the White Sox in baseball kept it from happening again in 2000 . <p> - Chicago teams hold half the longest current championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cubs , without a World Series title since 1908 , and the Blackhawks , who last won hockey 's Stanley Cup in 1961 . <p> - The Bears have n't had a winning season since 1995 and last made the NFL playoffs in ' 94 . Mike Ditka achieved legendary status , despite guiding his team to only one championship . <p> - The Cubs - despite stellar players like Santo , Ernie Banks and Ryne Sandberg - have essentially been out of championship contention since World War II . Since their 1945 World Series loss , they have finished within 10 games of first place just five times . <p> - The White Sox have n't won the World Series since 1917 and have n't been in one since 1959 . <p> - The Blackhawks have missed the NHL playoffs four straight years . <p> Sports economists and other experts blame a combination of reasons : <p> Poor player personnel decisions , owners more committed to the bottom line than winning - even the weather . Then there are the intangible factors , including Second City syndrome . <p> " Chicago should have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Temple University economics professor . " It 's one of the biggest cities , it has mega-media deals - the Cubs in particular - it 's got all these things going for it . And yet the teams do n't seem to win . <p> " It must be the water . " <p> The water aside - or was Michael Jordan drinking only Gatorade while leading the Bulls to six titles ? - a primary reason for all the losing may lie in financial numbers whose full extent remains closely guarded by the franchise owners . Winning may not be as important financially as it used to be . <p> Vince Lombardi said , " Winning is n't everything , it 's the only thing , " but Richard Sheehan , professor of finance and business economics at Notre Dame suggests an update : " Winning is n't everything - business is everything . " <p> Despite being in the nation 's third-biggest city with a far-reaching media market , Chicago teams rank only middle-of-the-pack in payroll and expenditures . Nos. 1 and 2 , New York and Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a $64 million payroll , and the White Sox at $62.3 million ranked 14th and 16th among baseball 's 30 teams as of Opening Day this spring , while New York and LA teams topped $100 million and accounted for three of the four fattest payrolls . <p> The Blackhawks were 16th of 30 teams in the NHL with a payroll of just under $32 million last season . The Bears , at $73 million , were eighth in the NFL . The Bulls had the NBA 's lowest payroll - but only because the elite free agents they tried to sign took one look at the lowly franchise and said no . <p> Some reluctance to spend heavily is sound business . Sports business experts say disincentives have been built into the system - from the increased revenue-sharing in the NFL to reverse-order drafts and parity scheduling . <p> In the NFL , says University of Chicago sports economist Allen Sanderson , 80 percent of revenues are shared , and national TV revenues - about two-thirds of all league income - are divided equally . The Bears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Somehow , there 's such loyalty in this community to certain teams that the owners do n't feel the financial imperative to succeed , " says Robert Baade , sports economist at Lake Forest College . " It seems to me there 's some loyalty surplus that these owners have abused . " <p> And spectators share the blame , just for showing up to watch a bad team ? <p> " People want to be entertained , " says Sanderson . " The blurry line between sports and entertainment is more blurred than ever now . The more it becomes about entertainment , the less the focus on competition . " <p> Mark Grace , a fixture at first base for the Cubs until they let him go to Arizona as a free agent , put it this way in Baseball Weekly : " What they are is a tourist attraction . All of the tourists come to see this historical monument ( Wrigley ) , and they do n't give one whit whether they win or lose . " All that matters , he says , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not true , insists the owner of the team since 1981 . " We want to win , but we want to do it in a way that makes economic sense , " Tribune executive vice president Dennis FitzSimons said recently . <p> Analyzing the finances of big-league sports franchises is difficult because of complex ownership structures and accounting maneuvers . But experts dismiss such reports as a Major League Baseball study released last year claiming that every team except the Yankees , Cleveland and Colorado lost money in 1995-99 . <p> Most teams are owned by a limited partnership , an individual or a larger corporation . <p> Authors James Quirk and Rodney Fort note in their book " Hard Ball : The Abuse of Power in Team Sports " that sports team owners have tax shelter opportunities not available to most other businesses . So , what appears to be a before-tax loss by the team can , under certain circumstances , be converted into an after-tax profit for the owner . <p> An esoteric factor is Second City complex , part of the notion that Midwesterners accept what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have portrayed Chicagoans as taking their share of hard knocks and accepting it . Could some of that attitude have rubbed off on their teams ? <p> Do n't laugh , it just may be true , says Bernard Beck , a Northwestern University expert on the sociology of sports . <p> The phrase " Second City " outraged Chicagoans , Beck notes , when it was coined by journalist A.J. Liebling in the New Yorker magazine in the ' 40s . But it 's long since become an accepted axiom that New York is top dog over Chicago . <p> " You 've got to believe there 's some kind of connection between the general public and how its sports teams do , " Beck says . <p> " It 's not that people in Chicago relish being losers , it 's just that they accept that in life there are losers . It 's sort of like the Russian national character - this stolid determination to survive no matter how bad life treats you . " <p> Winning , according to conventional wisdom , is good for not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune magazine estimated that Jordan alone had generated $10 billion for the U.S. economy and untold millions for the Chicago economy . <p> Since the Bulls and Blackhawks went bad , souvenir and sports memorabilia sales have fallen off . Even the pizza delivery business that thrived during the Jordan era has slacked off . <p> But there 's a silver lining to all the losing , and its local acceptance , says Sanderson , a Chicagoan since 1984 . <p> " I think a city can overdose on sports , " he says . " Maybe we have our values in not a bad place , in that we do n't care about the losing . We 're enjoying the museums , the lakefront , the restaurants and the other cultural amenities . I think the city has its sports in quite a reasonable perspective . " <p> End Adv for Weekend Editions , June 23-24 <p>
