Section : Special Report America 's Best Leaders <p> MICHAEL BLOOMBERG , JOEL KLEIN , PAUL VALLAS : Education Reformers <p> As icons of bureaucracy go , 110 Livingston Street , Brooklyn , was among the most powerful in the country . The labyrinthine building housed the New York City Board of Education for so long that the address itself became synonymous with cronyism and entrenched interests . So when the state granted the mayor direct control over New York City 's more than 1.1 million students and 1,450-plus schools in 2002 , the Livingston Street building was among the first to go . <p> In short order , Mayor Michael Bloomberg sold the building and moved school headquarters to the Tweed Courthouse , close enough that he could rap knuckles without leaving his City Hall office . " At the beginning , the Board of Education sort of rolled their eyes and thought ' this too would go away , ' " says Bloomberg . " Bureaucracies always assume that elected officials who want to change everything will quickly forget about it and get on to helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has consistently touted school reform as his top priority , did n't forget . Since the takeover , the city has instituted a controversial uniform reading program , cut administrative costs , and partnered with private groups in everything from facilities management to school construction . The on-time graduation rate has climbed to the highest in nearly 20 years , the achievement gap between minority students and their white counterparts is narrowing-if slightly-and social promotion has been eliminated . <p> The founder of the media company that takes his name , Bloomberg built an estimated $4.8 billion personal fortune by developing an innovative computer system that provided traders with the most up-to-date information . " As an entrepreneur , " he wrote in his autobiography , " I 've learned to know what I do n't know , get access to the people who do know , and then study hard . " <p> One of those who knows is Bloomberg 's handpicked school chancellor , Joel Klein . A product of the New York City schools himself , Klein is a veteran litigator who successfully pursued federal anti-trust claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radical career switch because he was passionate about the issue , he says , and anxious to stop a cycle of mediocrity . " Public education transformed my life . My father had to quit high school , and we grew up in public housing , and the teachers in Queens really gave me a worldview and a sense of opportunity and purpose , " he says . " Second , God has been good to me . And . I feel like if we do n't figure out how to educate all our kids-we 've got so many kids in this city who leave the school system unprepared for anything . " <p> Makeover . A systematic worker , Klein started from the premise that the most crucial people in a school system are teachers , and the most important change agents are principals . " Schools are the basic unit that needs changing , " Klein says , " and if we can empower the principals to lead their schools , we can reform the system from the top down and the bottom up . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by visiting two or three schools a week , typically unannounced . " I 'll ask students things like ' How many of your teachers care about you ? ' " he says . " It 's a very illuminating question . " <p> Taking a cue from business , Klein and Bloomberg established a principal leadership academy based on a corporate leadership school started by former General Electric Chairman Jack Welch , who is also an adviser to the program . The 15-month curriculum relies on problem-based learning to teach management techniques . " Welch talked to our senior leaders , " Klein said , " and he basically said that the challenge we face here is greater than the one he faced when he took over GE , and we have far fewer tools in our toolbox . " <p> As logical as Klein 's ideas sound , they represented a radical change ; previous reforms had been centered on the classroom-on higher pay and better teaching methods . In shifting the emphasis to the school leaders , Klein and Bloomberg were rejecting the traditional journeyman approach to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randi Weingarten , the head of the New York teachers union , gives Bloomberg credit for his boldness but faults him for dismissing a more teachercentric approach . <p> Still , New York managed to avoid a teachers strike by agreeing to a contract that gave teachers a 15 percent raise in exchange for productivity increases and givebacks . Says former New York Mayor Edward Koch : " Bloomberg 's not a charismatic figure , but he has a common decency and calm demeanor that allow him to get things done without raising tensions . " <p> Thick skinned . Centralizing authority and increasing accountability have been hallmarks of many big-city reform efforts . But firing principals and running charter schools is not for the faint of heart . As Bloomberg and Klein have learned , radical change requires leaders who can build public support and also withstand withering criticism . When the local school boards were dissolved , for instance , parents were troubled by the lack of connection with the education department . And some teachers have been demoralized by rules that compel teaching a specific curriculum . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status quo , " says Klein . But it comes with the territory . " If you 're going to hold your finger to the wind . you 're not going to be an effective leader , " he says . " If you 're not prepared for that dimension , you 're not going to be able to successfully lead-certainly if you want to lead large-scale complex reform or change . " <p> Another big-city reformer who can take the heat is Paul Vallas , a veteran of the Chicago public schools who assumed control of the Philadelphia school system after losing a primary bid for governor of Illinois . " I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I came in the door , " says Vallas , " because I had come from a district with exactly the same problems , and twice as large . There were no new discoveries to be made . " <p> So far , his initiatives show promise . Citywide , 42 percent of students scored at advanced or proficient levels on state math tests and 38 percent in reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 percent in reading just four years earlier . The achievement gap between ethnicities is narrowing , and school violence is down . Moreover , the number of schools that have met their goals as established by the No Child Left Behind Act has jumped to 166 in 2005-06 , from 153 in 2004-05 . The fact that 103 city schools are still failing to meet goals shows how much work Vallas has yet to do . <p> Running a school system is perhaps an unlikely job for a former city budget director who once spoke with a stutter and says he would have been assigned to special education classes had they existed at the time . Yet Vallas says he understood that " there is a potential in all students that is n't always realized-that they are often victims of a system that does n't always serve them as well as it could . " <p> To make sure his system does perform , Vallas makes careful observations-soliciting thoughts from parents , union representatives , and teachers-and then uses them to make new assignments . " I am always gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on , then you can find the right people to fix what does n't work . " And he expects results . " Anyone who 's worked for him feels an absolute need to be accountable , " says Phil Hansen , a former elementary school principal and retired chief accountability officer for the Chicago public schools . " I 've been paged while sitting in church and late on a Saturday night . " <p> Challenges . Like Bloomberg , Vallas has also managed to avoid the paralysis that comes when contract negotiations fail . As a teenager , he coordinated a group of 30 busboys , chefs , and wait staff at his father 's restaurant , and that taught him some valuable lessons , he says , including the importance of compromise . " The first order of business is always sitting down with the teachers and principals to find out what their solutions are . I did that in Chicago , and I did that here , " he says . " That 's probably why I 've never had a strike or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration . " <p> To be sure , challenges remain . Graduation and literacy rates in Philadelphia and New York are still dismal , and there is a huge and ever widening chasm between the haves and the have-nots . But there is a commitment to both the fixes and the fixers : Vallas 's contract has been extended through July 2009 , and he reportedly turned down an offer to head the Los Angeles school system . Mayoral control in New York will be reconsidered in the coming years as well . In the end , however , the success of education reforms can be measured only with years of hindsight . " Fixing education is a long-term thing , " says Bloomberg . " Whether it takes a long time to do it , or it takes a long time to see the results , does n't really matter . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chancellor Joel Klein and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have made radical changes to New York 's public schools . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : MENTOR . Superintendent Paul Vallas with students at Kearny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Klein <p> When I needed a chancellor , I went down my address book from A to Z , and I wrote down the names of anybody who I could conceivably think of somebody saying " oh he or she should be chancellor " so that I would give everybody a fair shot . And I looked down the list , and there was just no question . Right away , Joel Klein stood out . I interviewed maybe 10 people . The other nine-their names were in the paper the next day . Klein 's name was n't in the paper . That 's one of the reasons to pick him . But he 's also smart , and he cares . He worked his way up . Phenomenal academic background , management background , great feeling for people . I think what 's important is that he leads from the front . A lot of people think that management is about doing a poll , finding out what people want , then giving it to them . That 's leading from the back . Great advances are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform is littered with good ideas , poorly executed . The mayor understood that to execute his vision he needed to depoliticize the process . He understands management , understands accountability , and takes responsibility . I remember early on , one of our reforms had n't been executed properly , and it caused a lot of noise , and there were all sorts of stories in the newspaper . That morning , the mayor got up before the city and said fundamentally , " I 'm accountable ; we screwed this up ; we will fix it . " There was n't the almost inevitable finger-pointing you see in government : " We did n't get the right information ; this guy did n't do this . " There was the mayor standing before the entire city saying , " Nope , we did n't do this right ; we will fix it . That is our responsibility , and you should hold us accountable . " That , I think , is quite unique in public life . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
