<p> Each year , more than 541,000 injuries occur at our nation 's playgrounds . Many of these injuries could be prevented with attention to playground equipment installation and maintenance , appropriate surfacing material and playground design . <p> Orthopedic surgeons are the physicians who see firsthand the fractures , dislocations and other results of playground injuries . In many cases , surgical treatment is needed for these children . The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons is urging school officials , parents and community officials to perform a playground safety checkup on area playgrounds this spring . If you find unsafe conditions , report them to the proper authorities and do n't use the playground until corrections are made . <p> April is Injury Prevention Month , and orthopedic surgeons nationwide urge everyone to make sure their local playgrounds adhere to basic safety guidelines to prevent unnecessary injury : <p> **Never leave children alone on playgrounds . Keep children in your line of vision and make sure they follow playground safety rules . <p> **Steer children to age-appropriate playground equipment . <p> **Inspect playground equipment for damaged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps , steps and seats ; sharp edges or points because of wear or breakage and debris such as broken glass or metal and other hazards like rocks or tree roots . <p> **Check the playground surface . Look for shock-absorbing materials like rubber , or loose fill , such as double-shredded bark mulch . Do n't let children play on surfaces like asphalt , concrete , soil , packed dirt and grass . <p> For more information on playground safety tips and guidelines for making your neighborhood playground accessible and safe , visit the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Web site , www.aaos.org , or contact the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons ' public service phone line , ( 800 ) 824-BONES . <p> Vernon T. Tolo , M.D. , <p> president , American Academy <p> of Orthopedic Surgeons <p> The schoolyard brawl between two South Side elementary schools " Kids go on playground rampage , 18 injured , " news story , April 5 was a wake-up call to educators , community leaders and parents throughout Chicago . <p> These were young kids who resorted to taking up baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone agrees that the feud should never have been allowed to escalate . Everyone agrees that as a community of adults , we need to do a better job of serving these kids . But exactly what can we do ? We can make it a priority to teach our kids social skills , including conflict resolution and peer mediation . <p> As the leader of the largest independent youth services agency in Chicago , I 've seen great results from violence-prevention programs that teach these skills . <p> In the past , many of these programs were conducted in partnership with Chicago elementary and middle schools . But our schools face increasing pressure to improve student academic performance . There is n't enough time in the school day for everything we want our kids to learn . <p> There are quality youth service agencies and community groups throughout Chicago that keep our kids active and learning after school . Community centers such as the Chicago Youth Centers offer after-school and summer activities that include violence prevention and peer-mediation programs . <p> Our centers are in some of this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harsh fact of life . Now more that ever , we need the entire community of adults to support youth programs like ours to ensure that our kids have a place where they can be taught important life skills . <p> Miller R. Anderson , <p> president/CEO , <p> Chicago Youth Centers <p> The school brawl between students at two schools gives a firsthand look at what teachers have to face in dealing with so many out-of-control , violent children . Teachers spend a big part of a school day trying to get these children to sit down and shut up . <p> Parents are trying to shirk the duty of instilling obedience and discipline in their children . When they do n't do their job , all community life suffers . <p> Hattie Wilburn , South Shore <p> As an American Jew , I feel compelled to comment on the increasing pressure brought on the State of Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza . <p> It seems hypocritical that the United States should make such stringent demands of Israel  --  a country that has been besieged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , Americans lived without fear  --  blessed with secure borders . On Sept. 11 that changed , and in response our government has carried out a sustained military offensive in a country 8,000 miles away . <p> To compel the prime minister of Israel to negotiate with a terrorist is doubly hypocritical . Would President Bush meet with or negotiate with Osama bin Laden ? The answer , plainly , is no . Should the prime minister of Israel be asked to do something we , as a nation , would not be willing to do ? <p> While I support a withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza , I understand that Israel does not feel it can do so without a guarantee of peace and border security . In discussing land for peace , land and peace are not severable . Demanding land first and peace later is not negotiable  --  it has already proven ineffective . <p> The Israeli people want only to live in a country with secure borders and to enjoy a lasting peace with their neighbors . And that is why Jewish daily prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace like a star in the heavens bring peace to Israel and all the world . " <p> Aidan Gilbert , Hyde Park <p> We readers of the Sun-Times have been treated lately to oh so many lofty , sophisticated musings by the academics and pundits urging , with sternly furrowed brows , that America follow this or that intricate and artfully contrived policy with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . We would do well , perhaps , to take a more mundane view of things and adopt an approach derived from simple tenets of civil and just behavior . <p> First , be loyal to your friends . Who is our friend in this situation ? Israel , a democratic nation , loyal ally and fellow beneficiary of the Judeo-Christian tradition . Next , be fair . Do n't create one set of standards to govern U.S. dealings with terrorists , and then impose upon Israel a completely arbitrary and byzantine straitjacket for her own . Finally , mind your own business . It might be little uncomfortable for all the think-tankers and big thinkers out there , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And wish her well . <p> Missy Higgins , <p> Clarendon Hills <p> After reading the article " Daley : Hire Andersen victims " Business story , April 12 , I have never been so outraged by the stance our mayor is taking toward the recent layoffs at Andersen . I have worked closely with Arthur Andersen for the past nine years as a client and a vendor and can hardly call these people " victims . " Powerful , Chicago-based Andersen has given its employees many opportunities and clout that most in the business community were never as fortunate to experience . <p> I am sure there are many individuals who are entirely innocent in the recent events , but you have to take the good with the bad . Now Mayor Daley is acting as if these are the only people who have lost their jobs in Chicago , when in the last year thousands of us have been put out of work for a number of reasons not clouded in such negative shortcomings . <p> It is hard enough to find another good-paying job in this city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver spoon on our resumes and the mayor 's letter of reference . <p> John M. Hunt , Humboldt Park <p> What is wrong with the U.S. government ? We should stop giving money , tanks , planes and guns to Israel . Ariel Sharon is worse than Hitler . All the real trouble started when he was elected . He is power hungry . We should not back Sharon in what he is doing . Israel will lead us into World War III . <p> The United States is the only country that agrees with Israel . Israel is our friend if we agree with everything they do  --  plus , give them all the money , planes , tanks and guns . We can not buy friendship . Our government should stop backing Israel for the safety of the United States . <p> Rosemarie A. Przybylski , <p> Lemont <p> I must applaud Sen. Peter Fitzgerald 's pol-pummeling protege Patrick Fitzgerald on his aggressive stance toward political corruption in this state . With indictments and subpoenas flying , he 's a crime-busting breath of fresh air . <p> George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . Illinois citizens are properly mortified by their transmogrified perception of old grandfatherly George . <p> But it is uproariously risible and ridiculous for Illinois Democrats , who up to now had been quite cozy with and complimentary toward Ryan , to start piously clucking their forked tongues at Republicans . Tammany Hall had nothing on Da Mare and his on-the-make , on-the-take minions . And let 's not even talk about Bill Clinton . <p> It 's going to be a long and bumpy ride for our state 's politicians as the scum gets cleaned out of both parties . Their unconvincing convictions should be rewarded with incontestable crucial convictions . I ca n't wait ! <p> John Briatico Jr. , Bensenville <p> Three inner-city schools are to be closed " Daley backs school closings , " news story , April 12 . Teachers will be displaced . Will we see the same call from Mayor Daley for businesses to hire these " victims , " as he did for the Andersen " victims " ? <p> Just wondering . <p> Tasha Lynette Clopton , <p> West Englewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul balls hit in a row should be an automatic out . It 's similar to when a batter hits three fouls while attempting a bunt and is called out . This would speed up the game . <p> This rule should go into effect immediately  --  while the baseball season is still in its infancy ! <p> Bruno Jachymiak , <p> Libertyville
