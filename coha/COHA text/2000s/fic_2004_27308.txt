Heidi If truth was a crayon and it was up to me to put a wrapper around it and name its color , I know just what I would call itdinosaur skin . I used to think , without really thinking about it , that I knew what color that was . But that was a long time ago , before I knew what I know now about both dinosaur skin and the truth . The fact is , you ca n't tell squat about the color of an animal just from looking at its bones , so nobody knows for sure what color dinosaurs really were . For years I looked at pictures of them , trusting that whoever was in charge of coloring them in was doing it based on scientific fact , but the truth is they were only guessing . I realized that one afternoon , sitting in the front seat of Sheriff Roy Franklin 's squad car , the fall before I turned thirteen . Another thing I found out right around that same time is that not knowing something does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still room left to wonder . For instance about dinosaurswere they the same color as the sky the morning I set off for Liberty ? Or were they maybe the same shade of brown as the dust my shoes kicked up on the driveway at Hilltop Home ? I 'd be lying if I said that given a choice , I would n't rather know than not know . But there are some things you can just know for no good reason other than that you do , and then there are other things that no matter how badly you want to know them , you just ca n't . The truth is , whether you know something or not does n't change what was . If dinosaurs were blue , they were blue ; if they were brown , they were brown whether anybody ever knows it for a fact or not . Continues ...
