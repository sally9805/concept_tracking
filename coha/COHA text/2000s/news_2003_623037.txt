<p> MARSHAL BUSH FACES ' HIGH NOON ' <p> Editor  --  Many who hate George W. Bush like to call him a " cowboy , " invoking the notion of his being a feckless yahoo . <p> Bush reminds me of a cowboy in a famous movie . That movie is " High Noon , " and the cowboy is Marshal Will Kane ( played by Gary Cooper in the 1952 film ) . Kane had to face a criminal who had been sentenced to hang , only to have 19th century liberals release him after a few years in jail . He had vowed revenge on Kane . The townspeople of Hadleyville urged Kane to leave in order to avoid the problem . They hoped that the threat would n't amount to anything . Kane realized that running was not a choice , so he stayed to face it . <p> Kane attempted to rally support from his friends and neighbors . He only needed seven or eight deputies to help him deal with the baddies . But for various reasons , he wound up having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cowboy . And France and the anti-Bush protesters are the citizens of Hadleyville . <p> JAMES KING <p> Carmel <p> RESOLUTE OR RECKLESS <p> Editor  --  It was about time for someone such as Carolyn Lochhead to write why President Bush seemed so certain and sure of himself when everyone else was anxiety-ridden at this time ( " Bush calm , secure in his decision , " March 14 ) . <p> While analysts ponder the " r " words ( resolute or reckless ) used by opposing parties to describe him , a greater reality emerges . He is simply focused on the pursuit of his policies of political and social outcomes for which the presidency is just a means . <p> His position to lead and protect makes him a decisionmaker with an unchanged goal . We should all remember that after Sept. 11 , he adapted to the new era more efficiently than any other world figure , proposing an entirely new and expansive national security strategy . I , for one , choose to call Bush resolute . <p> SANDY JANE WONG <p> Mountain View @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . . . " article about analysts debating if Bush is resolute or reckless . I filed it under " A " for ambidextrous . Why ? Because like politicians , academics are skilled in two-handedness . That is , they employ " on the one hand " and " on the other hand , " or the equivalent , as a device for deciding nothing . <p> All those who argue that the president is resolute and all who argue that he is reckless miss the point . A cloud of erudition blinds both sides . We ordinary folks see our man in the White House quite plainly as resolutely reckless , which is the same as recklessly resolute . <p> MARVIN CHACHERE <p> San Pablo <p> KERRY IN COMBAT <p> Editor  --  So Sen. John Kerry is just another wannabe who is anti-war , bordering on anti-troop ( " Bush ' robbing Peter to pay Paul , ' Kerry says , " March 13 ) ? Let me explain to state Republican Party spokesman Rob Stutzman who Kerry is . He 's a decorated Vietnam War hero who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants on military issues . <p> I guess Stutzman prefers the tough talk and aggressive posturing from hawks such as George W. Bush and Dick Cheney . <p> By the way , how much combat have each of them seen ? I 'll save you the time . None . <p> TODD GANSER <p> San Francisco <p> THE ULTIMATE VIOLENCE <p> Editor  --  Elie Wiesel is an author and humanitarian I hold in high esteem , but I respectfully disagree with him ( Open Forum , " Peace not possible in facing down evil , " March 12 ) in his reasons for supporting an invasion of Iraq . Yes , international terrorism is a threat to the civilized world , but bombing Iraq and its citizens will not eradicate the problem . <p> Unlike Nazi Germany , international terrorism is not a country we can simply go into and weed out the problem . While the Allied Forces of World War II liberated Europe , one can hardly call the lethal firepower we will unleash on Iraq a " liberating " force for its citizens . The destruction will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Wiesel put so eloquently , war is the ultimate form of violence . Why would Wiesel , who has witnessed and experienced violence , contemplate war when the world community thinks other options have not been exhausted ? <p> OLIVIA WONG <p> El Cerrito <p> BLAME IT ALL ON BILL <p> Editor  --  I am ever so grateful to letter-writers such as Claire M. D'Orso ( " Forged evidence ? , " March 13 ) , who frequently remind us that everything wrong these days is Bill Clinton 's fault . The state of the military , Saddam Hussein , North Korea , the dreadful economy , and probably the French ; the complete list is too long for this letter , but generally , all of it can be laid at Bill 's doorstep . <p> You might think that George W. Bush could have vanquished some of the Evil One 's powers by now , but that 's because you have forgotten just how bad Bill was . Luckily , we have our Republican friends to help us stay focused . <p> ELAINE PARK <p> Redwood City <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep ? Try to imagine if you and your family were living in Baghdad right now . Would it somehow be justified if you became " ' collateral damage " ? Would you really choose to sacrifice your family so that Saddam Hussein could be eliminated ? Would you mind if that choice were made for you by a foreign country ? <p> LISA BOLLMAN <p> Windsor <p> CHRONICLE 'S GONE DEAF <p> Editor  --  Several days have gone by since Rep. James Moran , D-Va. , publicly said , " If it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq , we would not be doing this , " and still I wait for The Chronicle 's outrage . When Sen. Trent Lott let loose with his insensitive comments about the Confederacy , nary a day went by that The Chronicle did n't run a front-page , or prominently placed , article about Lott 's comment and his insufficient apologies or his past . Moreover , the editorial staff condemned him and asked that he step down as the leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why has The Chronicle gone deaf to what Moran has said ? Where are the articles digging into his past anti-Semitism ? Where are the calls for him to resign ? Perhaps if " D " is next to your name , as it is with Democrat Moran its OK to be anti-Semitic ? The Chronicle 's silence suggests that as long as you are a Democrat , any behavior is acceptable . Nice double-standard . <p> PAUL ROSCELLI <p> Professor of Economics <p> Canada College <p> Redwood City <p> ' HELP US LEARN ' <p> Editor  --  California is going through a budget crisis . Everyone should be aware of it . Soon our high school classes are going to be reduced from seven periods to six periods a day . Our elective classes are going to be cut . You will no longer be able to get an education in music . ( Music should be a part of all our lives . ) Class sizes are going to double . It 's going to be harder to learn . <p> Instead of money going toward education , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might steal because it 's an easy way to get money . They want money because they do n't have well paying jobs . You get a high-paying job by receiving a good education . Help us learn . Do n't take away our education by taking away money . It also takes away the jobs of our teachers . Children are the future . Make sure we get a proper education . <p> JAIMIE YUNG , 14 <p> Abbott Middle School <p> San Mateo <p> RISK TO CHILDREN <p> Editor  --  Regarding " Dangerous chemical found in women 's breasts , " ( March 12 ) : <p> The Chronicle 's otherwise excellent article on PBDEs in Bay Area women 's breast tissue failed to mention the enormous threat these chemicals may pose to children 's health . Their presence in breast milk and breast tissue indicates children may be exposed in the womb to chemicals shown to cause developmental and neurological damage in lab animals . Exposure at this vulnerable period of brain development may result in irreversible damage . <p> At a time when learning disabilities and developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , we need to seriously examine and reform the regulatory system that allows the widespread use of chemicals that threaten our children 's health . <p> SUSAN LEE <p> Environment California <p> San Francisco <p> LIPSON RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  In your March 13 article , " Bankruptcy rears its head at school board meeting , " The Chronicle inaccurately claims that I stated that my vote was based upon an inability to " comprehend the magnitude of the layoff warning notices . " Quite to the contrary , I am very well aware of the extent and consequences of our financial crisis . The statement that I made at the board meeting was that " I do n't feel that the information ( provided by the district ) is to the depth of what I need it to be to make the best informed decision , especially considering the magnitude of this issue . " <p> SARAH LIPSON <p> Commissioner <p> Board of Education <p> San Francisco <p> FRIES BOYCOTT <p> Editor  --  Instead of just renaming the offending food " freedom fries " as a swipe at France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether ? With the average American now consuming four orders of fries a week , a boycott could not only have a substantial impact on international opinion but on our national waistlines as well . <p> Saying " no " to oily fries would render more of our young men and women fit enough for the military , where they could fight for another kind of oil . And as increasing numbers come back in body bags rather than living to grow old , we could even lower the projected costs of Medicare and Social Security . <p> MEREDITH MINKLER <p> Kensington <p> SPRING BREAK KITS <p> Editor  --  Although I was not shocked to read about the spring break kit giveaway at SFSU in The Chronicle ( " A little help for spring break , " March 13 ) , I felt compelled to write and offer my observation that providing students , many of whom are underage and unmarried , with condoms , lubricant , etc. , perpetuates an attitude that encourages casual sex and underage drinking , behaviors that are epidemic among college students , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extremely poor taste , and at worst , very irresponsible . I hope that no taxpayers ' money was used to provide these so-called kits , but I am not holding my breath . After all , anyone who would think it was appropriate to provide such items to college students , would probably have no qualms about using tax money for such a dubious endeavor . <p> JEFF DICELLO <p> Sanita Rosa <p> A jury is a law unto itself <p> Editor  --  Judge Quentin Kopp correctly proclaims that jurors have no right to ignore the law in refusing to convict ( Letters , March 8 ) , but he should have added that jurors have the power to do that and that no one , robed or otherwise , can do anything about it . A federal court has even described jury nullification as " a fundamental necessity of a democratic system . " <p> Jury nullification frustrates folks who fear anarchy , but it ought to comfort them that it is rarely applied and has not caused anarchy . In fact , courts and commentators have acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishments , such as incarcerating a person who grew marijuana for medical purposes under the auspices of a city government or sending a petty thief to prison for life . On the other hand , in days gone by , juries in the Deep South routinely used the power to let racist murderers go free and in more recent times in California it may have been applied in the trial of a sports figure who stood accused of a double-murder . <p> L.M. WIJSEN <p> Alameda . <p> Editor  --  It 's hard to understand how someone so ignorant of the American jury system can become a judge . <p> Jury nullification is not only constitutional , it was touted as a virtue by most of the Founding Fathers . The writers of the Constitution were men who had seen firsthand the tyranny of a legal system that ignored people 's rights and they were determined that citizens of the United States would have the power to overturn bad laws by ignoring them and acquitting regardless of the " evidence . " <p> Judge Quentin Kopp 's fears about the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unheard of for a jury to ignore the evidence and acquit for real crimes such as rape , armed robbery , kidnapping and murder . Juries are not crazy or frivolous , and when they nullify they do so with serious intent . <p> Kopp seems to forget that the cases in question here involve medical marijuana , not crimes against people . <p> The " invidious debasing of our judicial system " comes from " Reefer Madness " laws based on the most ridiculous fictions in legislative history . The lies used to outlaw marijuana are so ridiculous that the proper response to the term " marijuana crime " would be gales of laughter aimed at Kopp and any other proponents of marijuana prohibition , except for the fact that putting people in jail for " Reefer Madness " is no joke . <p> REDFORD GIVENS <p> San Francisco . <p> Editor  --  Judge Quentin Kopp says ( in part ) that jurors understand and obey the sworn oath which they accept before commencing their grave duties in every criminal and civil case . ' <p> When the 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even pretending to deliberate , it exposed the fact that a jury is a law unto itself . There is apparently no penalty for violating the oath , which means that the oath is meaningless and the jury is free to do as it sees fit . <p> CHARLES KELLY <p> Fairfax . <p> Editor  --  Judge Quentin Kopp is , to put it bluntly , dead wrong . When laws are used to infringe on the fundamental rights of people , it is the duty of every citizen to , in his words , flout ( or , in words of the people , nullify ) arbitrary and unjust laws . It 's becoming apparent that the lessons of Nuremberg have been lost on Judge Kopp  --  does he have any business being near a bench with this attitude ? <p> TIM MEEHAN <p> Communications Director <p> Ontario Consumers for Safe Access <p> to Recreational Cannabis <p> Toronto
