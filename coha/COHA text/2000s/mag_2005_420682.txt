// Before you blame your chronic headaches on stress or chalk up your constant colds to a weak immune system , you may want to examine your diet . " Many women think that pain or other symptoms , like mood swings and hair loss , are the result of a serious medical condition , when something far more simple is the cause : their eating habits , " says Gail Frank , R.D. , Dr.RH. , a professor of nutrition at California State University , Long Beach , and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . " It 's important to remember that everything you consume will affect your body , from your skin to your digestive system . " That 's not to say symptoms like stomach cramps or depression do n't warrant a doctor 's visit . But before you schedule one , you 'll want to take an inventory of what you 've been eating - or not eating - and consider making an appointment with a dietitian too . ( For a recommendation , visit eatright.org . ) On the following pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between six common - problems and poor dietary habits , and tell you how to get your diet - and your health - back on track . Problem Weakness , fatigue Possible cause A low-calorie diet Dipping below your daily calorie needs ( more on that later ) is a major health no-no . " Your body uses food as fuel , " Frank explains . " If you 're not eating enough , your system slows down and begins to burn muscle tissue for energy , which is a large part of why you may feel weak , tired or lightheaded . " Experts suggest consuming 1,800-2,400 calories a day , depending on your height , weight and activity level . Cure Visit Shape.com/calories to calculate your individual daily calorie needs . If you 're trying to lose weight , talk to a dietitian about your eating habits , Frank advises . But keep in mind that no matter how much weight you want to lose , you should never drop below 1,200 calories a day . When to see a doctor If you start eating more but still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or concentrating . You could have a virus such as Epstein-Barr or mononucleosis , or another serious condition such as depression . Photograph // Problem Mood swings , short-term depression , increased appetite Possible cause A high-protein , low-carp diet Consuming fewer than 50 grams of carbs a day can lead to a decrease in serotonin , the brain chemical that regulates both mood and appetite , according to two studies from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge . " A dip in serotonin means that you 're more vulnerable to mood swings and even a depressed mood - and that you may not experience a " full " feeling after eating , " explains Judith Wurtman , Ph.D. , MIT scientist and a co-author of both studies . " On the other hand , carbohydrates help stimulate serotonin production . After you eat them , your mood improves and you feel sated . " If that is n't reason enough to jump off the low-carb wagon , a study from RVA University in Copenhagen , Denmark , shows that people on low-carbohydrate , high-protein diets report more muscle cramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cure To keep your blood sugar stable , preventing crashes that lead to mood swings and shakiness , eat a diet that 's rich in complex carbohydrates ( aim for at least five servings a day from sources like whole-grain pasta , brown rice and vegetables ) as well as protein and unsaturated fats ( found in fish , olive oil and nuts ) . When to see a doctor If binge eating , mood swings or depression lasts more than two weeks , see a physician and/or psychologist , who can determine whether you have a more serious condition . Problem Headaches Possible cause Trigger foods Headaches - believed to be caused by swelling blood vessels in the head - can be triggered by alcohol , caffeinated beverages , cheese , deli meats , chocolate , nuts , foods with MSG and even bananas , says David Buchholz , M.D. , associate professor of neurology at Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University and author of Heal Your Headache ( Workman , 2002 ) . " Some people react to chemicals in certain foods , " he explains . " For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common irritant . " Cure Buchholz suggests that when a headache strikes , write down everything you 've eaten that day . If your list contains one of the foods mentioned above , avoid eating it for several weeks . Then , slowly reintroduce it ; if you eat or drink it again and your headache returns , you 've found your culprit . When to see a doctor If your headache is so painful and sudden that you ca n't function normally . Keep in mind that some people suffer from chronic headaches - often called migraines - for no apparent reason . A headache specialist can help determine the best course of treatment . Problem Digestive troubles Possible cause Not consuming enough fiber , or eating foods you ca n't tolerate Women often blame gastrointestinal problems like pain , diarrhea and constipation on a " sensitive stomach , " says Susan Lucak , M.D. , a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City . " More often than not , their diet lacks fiber , which cleanses the system and regulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach problems are the result of an intolerance , either to wheat or , more commonly , dairy : " Twenty-three percent of Americans ca n't digest lactose , the sugar found in milk . When they consume dairy products , they may experience bloating , gas or diarrhea , " Lucak says . Cure Pay attention to whether there 's a link between certain foods you eat and your symptoms , and if there is , make changes to your diet . Aim for 25-35 grams of fiber a day , to keep you regular . Good sources include whole-wheat breads and cereals , beans and vegetables . When to see a doctor If you experience severe stomach pain or vomiting , or if any symptom such as constipation or diarrhea lasts more than three days and/or is accompanied by weight loss or gain , you could have irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) or celiac disease , a disorder in which the lining of the small intestine becomes inflamed from foods that contain gluten , such as bread and other wheat products . Problem Hair loss Possible cause A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins A and C If you 're not eating right , your locks will show it . " Hair is made of protein , which your body produces when you 're healthy and following a balanced diet , " says Megan Majernik , R.D. , a clinical dietitian at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago . But consuming too few calories or simply skimping on protein , iron and vitamins , especially A and C , which are crucial for cell growth , means your system wo n't have the energy and nutrients it needs to create hair . Cure To keep your hair healthy and strong , be sure you 're eating enough calories . Also , aim for 700 micrograms of vitamin A a day ( good sources include leafy green vegetables like spinach , as well as eggs and dairy products ) and 65 milligrams of vitamin C daily ( citrus fruits like tangerines , strawberries and red bell peppers provide a good dose ) . When to see a doctor If your hair falls out rapidly or in clumps . You could have a thyroid condition ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone ) and hyperthyroidism ( when the body produces too much ) can be culprits . Studies have shown that consuming too much vitamin A , although rare , can also lead to hair loss . In addition , sudden physical trauma - including extreme nutritional changes - can cause your hair follicles to release " telogen " hairs , those that are in the resting stage of the growth cycle . Problem PMS ( Premenstrual syndrome ) Possible cause Too much sodium , sugar or caffeine , or too little fiber . As tempting as it is , chowing down on potato chips and espresso ice cream before your period can exacerbate and even cause PMS symptoms . Specifically , sodium can cause bloating , while caffeine and sugar may induce mood swings . Lack of fiber may also be behind your constipation or diarrhea that often occur before your period , says Diana Taylor , R.N. , Ph.D. , in Taking Back the Month : A Personalized Solution/or Managing PMS and Enhancing Your Health ( Perigee , 2003 ) . " Excessive sugar is particularly problematic , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down an hour later , " Frank agrees . " That 's when you become ravenous - and , often , cranky . " Cure To help combat PMS , consume 25-35 grams of fiber daily , try to limit yourself to one caffeinated beverage a day and keep your daily sodium intake below 1,500 milligrams . No more than 25 percent of your total calories should come from added sugars that are found in junk food . You may also want to up your calcium intake to at least 1,000 grams a day ; several studies , including one recently published in the Jour-1 nal of American College of Nutrition , report that calcium from supplements or food may help ease PMS symptoms . When to see a doctor If your mood swings become extreme and are accompanied by depression or feelings of suicide , you may be suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder , a more severe form of PMS that 's treatable with medication . You should also contact your gynecologist or physician if symptoms like headaches or cramps render you unable to function normally .
