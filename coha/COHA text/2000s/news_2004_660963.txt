<p> Do you know what makes coral , a bird 's bone , and wood so strong ? Hint : You ca n't see it , but you really need it . The answer is holes ! <p> You may think that a completely solid object is always the strongest . Think again . When nature needs something to be strong and lightweight , holes are just the thing . Scientists call these hole-filled materials " cellular solids . " Wood , bird ( and some human ) bones , coral , porcupine quills , and plant stalks are just a few examples of cellular solids . <p> Humans have learned nature 's lesson and turned it into ways to make things like cars and packaging more lightweight . <p> Lorna J. Gibson is a professor of materials science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , Mass . She describes cellular solids as " a combination of solid rods , or plates and holes . " Each rod or plate is connected to adjoining rods or plates . <p> Cellular solids are classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellular solids , the plates all go in the same direction . Plates are randomly scattered in foamlike materials . <p> Coral as strong as concrete <p> Coral is " just dead skeleton , " says University of Buffalo ( SUNY ) biology professor Howard R. Lasker . In the ocean , coral is made up of many thousands of tiny animals called polyps . The cylinderlike polyps grow upward from their coral base . Think of a polyp as " a straw with long curtains inside , " Professor Lasker says . The " curtains , " called septa , are made of calcium carbonate . That 's the same material seashells are made of . Some corals are about as strong as concrete , he says . <p> And because of the holes in between the calcium carbonate " curtains , " a coral is able to grow larger than it would if it was completely solid , and do so without sacrificing strength , Lasker says . <p> Now imagine a structure hundreds of feet tall , thousands of yards wide , and as long as the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia 's east coast . Coral reefs are found throughout the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean . <p> To be strong , you have to bend a little <p> Wood 's cells " are like a honeycomb , " Professor Gibson says . A tree needs to be strong to support itself . When you look at wood under a microscope , you can see that its structure is like a honeycomb . The plates and hollows let the cells stretch or compress slightly under pressure . This flexibility helps a tree to be able to withstand strong winds . <p> Helping birds to stay up <p> Many ( but not all ) bird species have hollow bones . Bones that are strong and lightweight help birds fly , especially over long distances . According to Gary Ritchison , an ornithologist at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond , " size determines whether birds have ' pneumatic ' bones . " A pneumatic bone is one that is largely hollow inside . The interior is " a series of little bone sections - like struts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite sides of bone to strengthen them . <p> Small songbirds such as bluejays and robins do n't need hollow bones because they only weigh an ounce or two . They do n't need extra weight-saving tactics . Larger , heavier birds - crows , for example - do need pneumatic bones . <p> Since the primary reason for hollow bones is flight , water birds like loons , grebes , or cormorants have more solid bone structures . Being heavier makes it easier for them to dive . Having hollow bones would be like trying to dive underwater while wearing a life preserver . <p> Have a slice of cellular solid with jam <p> It 's easy to recognize the strength of coral , wood , or bird bone . But what about meringue , bread , or a Nestle Aero candy bar ? They 're full of air spaces . They are cellular solids , too . But are they strong ? <p> Get a piece of wood and press on it . Now take a piece of bread and do the same thing . How would you describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends upon a structure and how it is loaded . " <p> " Loading " is an engineering concept . Think of someone sitting in a chair : That person is " loading " his weight onto the chair . How well the chair holds up tells us how strong the structure is for its weight . This idea also applies to cellular solids . But even though each object has its own strength , it is n't really possible to compare coral to bread . Or meringue to wood . Each cellular solid has its own unique properties that give it strength . <p> Okkyung Kim Chung is a cereal chemist and research leader who directs the United States Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service . She says that breads , rolls , and cakes are " foamlike " cellular solids . Their plates are scattered randomly . <p> When bread dough is first mixed there is n't much air in it . Air is introduced by kneading . Kneading produces little pockets of air - let 's call them cells of air - in the dough . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide expands the existing air cells ( it does n't create new cells on its own ) as the dough rises and becomes lighter or " leavened . " As the dough is baked , the heat expands the air in the cells still more . Baked bread is 80 to 85 percent air , by volume , says Dr. Chung . <p> The baking industry today has complicated machines to determine how strong bread is ( you can see a picture of such a machine at : www.gardco.com/lfra.html ) . But American consumers have figured out their own test for bread strength . It 's called " making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . " " If the bread can hold up under the peanut butter and jelly without dropping through and onto the floor , " Chung says , then the bread is strong enough . <p> Or take a cellular solid for a spin <p> Drop a metal pipe in the water , and it sinks . But what happens when you put " metal foam " into water ? It floats ! <p> Metal foam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copper , graphite , tin , carbon , zinc , lead , or titanium . Just about any metal that can be made into powdered form can become a " metal foam . " It is used for objects that need to be strong and lightweight . For example , in cars , aluminum foam is placed between two solid pieces of metal to create a " sandwich panel , " helping to reduce a car 's weight , Gibson says . <p> Here 's how aluminum foam is made : First , powdered aluminum and titanium hydride ( titanium that 's been compounded with hydrogen ) are mixed together and compressed . Then the mixture is heated until the aluminum melts . As it melts , the titanium hydride releases hydrogen gas . The gas creates bubbles in the metal . The resulting metal foam is cooled . A hard foam that looks like plastic is the result . The metal foam is amazingly lightweight because 70 to 90 percent of it is holes . ( To see metal undergoing a foaming process , go to : **33;1080;TOOLONG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials that are as strong as possible and that use as little material as possible . " By copying nature , we have learned how to make our world safer and better . ( See the accompanying story above for another example of a cellular solid made by humans . ) <p> So look closely at the objects all around you . There is still a whole lot - or should I say " hole " lot ? - to be learned every day ! <p> Test the strength of a cardboard ' sandwich ' <p> The common corrugated cardboard box is strong because it is constructed like a sandwich . There is a thin solid piece ( a face ) on the top and another on the bottom . In the middle is a wavy , corrugated ( from the Latin word for ' wrinkled ' ) core - a cellular solid . This core keeps the faces apart . Prof. Lorna Gibson , a materials scientist at MIT , says ' that distance between the faces gives the cardboard box its stiffness . ' In fact , a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and weight will not be as stiff as the corrugated ' sandwich . ' <p> You can prove this for yourself . You will need a corrugated cardboard box ( and a grownup 's permission to cut it up ) , scissors , a ruler , and a piece of solid cardboard that 's about the same weight as the corrugated cardboard of the box . <p> Carefully cut two strips of corrugated cardboard out of the box . Make them about 18 inches long and as skinny as you can - an inch or so wide . <p> Cut one of the cardboard strips ' with the grain . ' That is , cut one length of cardboard in the same direction as the wrinkles in the corrugation . When you look at the long side of this strip edge-on , you wo n't be able to see through it . Cut another strip ' against the grain . ' When you look at this strip edge-on , you will be able to look through the little tunnels created by the wrinkled paper . Cut the solid piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three strips do you think will be strongest ? Let 's test them . <p> First , hold each one in turn at the very end and wave it . Which one seems to wiggle the most ? <p> Try a different test . You 'll need a supply of pennies for this . Make sure your strips are all the same width and length . Put one of the strips between two objects of the same height ( books , perhaps ) . Notice how far the strips overlap on the books , as you 'll want to duplicate this spacing for the other strips . Now start piling pennies , one by one , in the middle of the strip . How far does each strip bend under five pennies ? Ten pennies ? Does any strip collapse ? So which one is the stiffest ? In other words , which one bends the least under a load ? <p> Cardboard 's strength comes from the sandwich structure - but only when the height of the box goes ' with the grain .
