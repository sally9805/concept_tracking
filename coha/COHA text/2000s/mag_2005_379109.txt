Sir Richard Branson is just as likely to be traversing the Atlantic in a hot-air balloon as hatching ideas for the Virgin Group 's 200-odd businesses . The British CEO is ramping up U.S. operations , with plans for a new airline next year . He talked to TIME 's Barbara Kiviat about planes , space travel and the band he let get away . <P> TIME You got on the wing of an airplane with Pamela Anderson to celebrate Virgin Atlantic 's 21st anniversary . Will there come a point when you 're too old to do those things ? <P> RICHARD BRANSON Most likely , yes . And I 've been backpedaling a bit . But I do n't have any children of an age where they could step into my shoes and take on the baton . I 've got a 19-year-old son , but I think it 's important he does n't end up doing my job just because he 's my son . <P> TIME Airlines are a tough industry to be in these days . How have you done so well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we have the business market , with our limousines , our stand-up bars , our manicures . Because we 've captured the business market , that 's enabled us to keep fares at the back of the plane down . <P> TIME Why does the U.S. need another low-fare carrier ? <P> R.B. In most businesses , America is superb at customer service . The American airline industry is not . We 're not necessarily saying it needs another low-cost carrier . I do believe it needs the kind of carrier that 's more akin to Virgin Atlantic . <P> TIME Do you ever kick yourself for not joining David Neeleman when he wanted to start JetBlue with you ? <P> R.B. Yes . I 'm not somebody who looks back and has enormous regret , but there 's no question that was a mistake . <P> TIME Made any others ? <P> R.B. I failed to sign Dire Straits . And I say yes to more things than I perhaps should . To some people , that 's a mistake . At head office , my nickname is Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial flights to space in 2 1/2 years . At $200,000 a ticket , how much of a market do you think there is for space tourism ? <P> R.B. There is a gigantic market . We 've had 40,000 people put their names down . We 've gone to the first hundred and said , We need you to pay a $200,000 deposit up front . And all hundred have paid that price . We 're now going after the others . A lot of people are going to drop away when it comes to putting up hard cash , but after five or seven years , I think we 'll be able to start bringing prices down and enable more people to go up in space . I hope that in my lifetime , Virgin Galactic will be taking people to a beautiful hotel on the moon . <P> TIME So this is really going to happen ? <P> R.B. There 've already been four successful flights of SpaceShipOne , which is the basic technology . People have been extremely skeptical about almost everything I 've ever launched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say we 're going to deliver on . And we certainly will deliver on this . <P> TIME Who are your role models ? <P> R.B. Nelson Mandela . I suspect he 's the greatest living person of the last 100 years . As far as business , Herb Kelleher , founder of Southwest Airlines , is incredible . The only problem is , when I have lunch with him , I end up starting to smoke again , so I 'm trying not to see him for a while . <P> TIME We 're not going to see a second season of The Rebel Billionaire , are we ?
