<p> Kanye West 's performance at the House of Blues a few weeks ago was a triumphant moment for Chicago hip-hop . <p> The 26-year-old South Side native and red-hot producer had released his debut album , " College Dropout , " on Feb. 10 . Barely 24 hours later , the disc was already on course to debut at No. 2 on the Billboard albums chart . <p> At his celebratory homecoming gig , Kanye was joined onstage for a symbolic passing of the torch by the most successful rapper that Chicago had produced to date  --  Common , who broke out of the Windy City in the early ' 90s . <p> The former Rashied Lynn accompanied his younger protege on several songs , and it was clear that Common could n't be prouder of Kanye 's success  --  or happier about what it might mean for the local hip-hop scene . <p> " My man is singlehandedly bringing hip-hop to a whole new level , " Common declared . " There are going to be 10 rappers from Chicago signed in the next six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing breeds imitation like success . And the Chicago music world has n't witnessed success on this level since 1993 . <p> Back then , prompted by the critical and commercial triumphs of alternative rockers such as the Smashing Pumpkins , Liz Phair , Urge Overkill and Veruca Salt , Billboard , the bible of the music business , ran a lengthy front-page series branding Chicago as " the next Seattle " and " the new capital of the cutting edge . " <p> The articles ran complete with a map of Wicker Park marking the location of every venue that booked live music . Major label talent scouts descended on our town en masse with their corporate credit cards drawn , wining and dining every garage band on the scene , and a dozen local groups were signed in the months that followed . <p> Many of these acts were dropped just as quickly  --  the alternative-rock boom was already on the wane at the time  --  but for a few months , Chicago was indeed as trendy as the grunge epicenter of Seattle had ever been . Suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional industry centers of New York , Nashville or Los Angeles in orders to take their career to the next level . They could try to grab the brass ring while staying in what Billy Corgan called " the city by the lake . " <p> More than a decade later , Kanye 's " College Dropout " is hanging steady at No. 8 after seven weeks on the Billboard albums chart , and it is approaching sales of a million copies . Meanwhile , another album , " Kamikaze " by Chicago speed-rapper Twista ( which features several tracks that Kanye produced ) , is perched at No. 18 . It debuted at No. 1 nine weeks ago , and it has already been certified as platinum , with more than a million copies sold . <p> As these two Chicago rappers maintain a presence at the top of the charts and on radio and video play lists , the promise that Common made onstage at the House of Blues several weeks ago hangs in the air , and rappers , DJs , producers and fans are wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at long last usher in a golden age for Chicago hip-hop ? Will 10 acts really be signed from the Windy City in the weeks to come , and , if so , who will they be ? Most important , who are the local underground rappers most deserving of the national spotlight ? <p> A Second City of hip-hop ? <p> In terms of the amount of national attention that its rappers have received  --  though certainly not the talents that it has given us  --  Chicago has long been a " second city " not only to New York and Los Angeles , but also to Atlanta and Detroit . <p> Those cities have all produced one or more readily identifiable styles of rapping and schools of hip-hop production . But there has never been one dominant " Chicago sound . " <p> " In Chicago , we get influences from everywhere  --  that 's why it 's hard to have a Chicago sound , " says Chris Tannehill , a.k.a . DJ Cosmo , who hosts " The Hip-Hop Project " on community radio WLUW ( 88.7-FM ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are influences from New York 's Wu-Tang Clan , and a lot of people have the Tupac influence , and Dr. Dre and all that West Coast stuff . That 's why it 's so hard to pinpoint a sound from here . " <p> Allen Johnson , the publicist for the local independent label Birthwriter , agrees . <p> " There has been so much talent that 's come out of here , but it has n't been as genre-defining as the ' dirty South ' style , where you know right off the bat that this person is from somewhere in the South , " Johnson says . " Whether it 's Lil ' John or OutKast or Ludacris , you know where they 're from just from what they talk about or their vocal clarity or things like that . " <p> Though Chicago has produced such staggering talents as Common , No ID , Rubberoom and Malik Yusef  --  as well as novelty acts such as Da Brat and H.W.A. and one-hits wonders such as Crucial Conflict and Do or Die  --  the city has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The New York-based magazine the Source even went as far as describing Chicago as " a city of 3 million muth  --  as that ca n't rap . " <p> Kanye has finally put that notion to the lie , according to Damon Dash , the CEO of Roc-A-Fella Records , the label that he started with superstar rapper Jay-Z . <p> " L.A. got its time , St. Louis got its time  --  it 's just when there is a proper individual representing and the proper venue to display his talent , then everyone gravitates to the area and the artist , " Dash says . " There 's been a scene out there in Chicago for a long time , but now it 's coming to the masses . " <p> Still , despite the success that Kanye has had on his label , Dash is n't looking to sign any other Chicago rappers to Roc-A-Fella . <p> " I 'm not that much of a trend-follower ; I 'm a trendsetter , " he says . " People are always jumping on the bandwagon . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the next Kanye or Twista , but those are people with small visions . They should 've been there from the beginning . A true A &R; talent scout has a true ear . It 's like me  --  if I do n't get it first , I do n't want it anymore . " <p> Many veterans of Chicago 's hip-hop scene are skeptical that we 'll see a flood of local artists signing to the major labels , or that lightning will strike for a third time any time soon with another Windy City rapper topping the charts . They note that R. Kelly 's rise to superstardom in the R &B; world  --  which coincided with the alternative rock explosion in the ' 90s  --  did not automatically translate to a rash of signings of other Chicago R &B; and soul singers . <p> They note that Common and West both achieved their greatest success only after they left Chicago for New York ( though Twista remains here , and he even told me that he hopes to open a hip-hop club in town ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other artists or producers  --  Common with the Roots and their extended family ( including D'Angelo and Erykah Badu ) ; West with Jay-Z , and Twista with West . <p> Connections with the " right " producer arguably matter more in hip-hop than in any other genre of popular music . " As far as Chicago rappers getting signed , I see it happening more through Kanye , whoever he 's worked with , or Twista and his camp , than the labels coming to town to sign people in the clubs or from the streets , " says rapper PNS of Chicago underground favorites the Molemen . <p> But perhaps the biggest factor indicating that the Chicago hip-hop scene wo n't be undergoing the sort of major-label feeding frenzy that the city 's rock world witnessed in the ' 90s is the fact that the music industry today is a very different business from the one that existed a decade ago . <p> Corporate consolidation of the major labels , ever-shrinking rosters , an increasing emphasis on the bottom line over artist development and the industry 's tardiness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that labels are signing fewer acts than before  --  and independent artists arguably need the big companies less than ever . <p> " There are a lot of people in this city who I think are perfectly happy with underground success  --  like the Molemen and the Family Tree artists , " Tannehill says . " They do n't have to worry about a label telling them what to do . It might take a little longer , because they have to come up with all of the money themselves . But ultimately , they can do exactly what they want . " <p> In this regard , Chicago 's underground hip-hop scene mirrors the city 's post-alternative underground rock scene , with an impressive array of diverse and original talents , a dedicated and thriving infrastructure of independent labels and a devoted following in the clubs ( though the live hip-hop scene , like the underground rock scene , is having a difficult time , thanks to the city 's much-publicized post-E2 club crackdown ) . <p> The next ' 10 in six weeks ' <p> Whether the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country are definitely finding their attention drawn to the city by the lake . And those who take the time to listen and explore its bustling underground are being richly rewarded . <p> Critics of course do n't run the music world , but if I had the power to realize Common 's dream  --  making national stars of 10 Chicago hip-hop acts in the next six weeks  --  these are the artists who I would single out to follow in the wakes of Kanye and Twista ( along with Common , who has signed to Kanye 's new Roc-A-Fella-distributed label and is working on producing his fifth album ) . <p> 1 . DIVERSE <p> Born in Englewood as Kenny Jenkins , Diverse has built up a significant buzz for his debut album , " One A.M. , " recently released on the independent Chocolate Industries label . The jazzy , soulful , genre-hopping production ( courtesy of an all-star roster that includes Prefuse 73 , RJD2 and Madlib ) has been compared by some to the Roots ' " Phrenology , " while Diverse 's erudite , uplifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Water for Chocolate . " <p> In fact , while there might not be a " Chicago sound " in terms of production , a common thread is emerging in the lyrics of many of Chicago 's best rappers : They refuse to pander to the gangsta cliches that dominate so much of the music from the East and West coasts or the South . Rhyming in his quick , agile , free-flowing style , Diverse has the vision to chart a complicated tale of street violence that clams both the guilty and the innocent in " Ai n't Right , " and the depth to imagine " seeing " life through the eyes of the sightless in " Blindman . " Tracks such as these promise great things to come . <p> 2 . J.U.I.C.E . <p> Renowned as one of the finest freestylers that Chicago has ever produced , J.U.I.C.E . has long been pegged as the rapper most likely to break out of the local scene and go national . In 1997 , he twice defeated Eminem in freestyling competitions at the Rap Olympics in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' s reputation is well-deserved . <p> " It seems like in the underground scenes , when most people think of Chicago , they think of J.U.I.C.E. , " Tannehill says . " But I do n't know if he wants to be signed and to blow up like that  --  I do n't know him personally , but he might be perfectly happy with the success he has . I think he would have been signed already if he really wanted to be . " <p> J.U.I.C.E . has n't released a full album of his own since 2001 's impressive " 100% J.U.I.C.E. , " which was mixed by DJ Risky Bizness and featured appearances by major names like Common and Jay-Z . But he provided the lead track on last year 's " The Chicago Project " compilation disc , which offered a solid overview of the local scene and also featured contributions from All Natural 's Capital D , the Opus , Earatik Statik and Offwhyte and Qwel , the last two among the many strong artists who record for the ambitious Galapagos4 label ( www.galapagos4.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago underground , the Molemen  --  Panik , Memo and PNS  --  are a trio of talented producers and sometime-MCs who could well follow the path that Kanye took to fame and fortune , hooking up with outside artists and winning recognition for their production work before garnering acclaim as artists in their own right . <p> On the 2001 compilation album " Chicago City Limits , " the Molemen showed the range of their talents behind the mixing board by crafting tracks for some of the city 's best MCs , including Pugslee Adams , J.U.I.C.E. , Qwel and Capital D. Last year , they won accolades for their work on Vakill 's album " The Darkest Cloud . " <p> And as the long list of group and solo releases on their Web site ( www.molemen.com ) testifies , hardly a day goes by when they 're not stopping by the recording studio . <p> 4 . ALL NATURAL <p> 5 . IOMOS MARAD <p> David Kelly ( a.k.a . Capital D ) and his partner Tony Fields ( DJ Tone B. Nimble ) have been recording as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , layered musical backings and smart lyrics based on the old-school political style of " edutainers " such as KRS-One . ( Their debut album , 1998 's " No Additives , No Preservatives , " opened with a track called " Phantoms of the Opera " that was built on a riff by Tchaikovsky and was dedicated to dissing gangsta rappers obsessed with kidnapping . ) <p> The group enhanced its reputation with 2001 's " Second Nature , " and in 2002 , Capital D branched out with a solo release called " Writer 's Block ( the movie ) , " which ranked with some of the sharpest , funniest , most passionate and most politically aware hip-hop that Chicago has produced . <p> Meanwhile , All Natural has been expanding its so-called Family Tree collective of artists . Among the others who are winning some well-deserved attention : Daily Planet , Mr. Greenweedz and especially Iomos Marad , who came on strong as a solo act with last year 's " Deep Rooted " album . Rhyming and playing drums simultaneously , Marad is smart , positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first name means " I 'm on my own style , " while " Marad " stands for " multiple abstract rhymes always directing . " <p> 6 . THE NACROBATS <p> Recording for their own independent Birthwriter Records label ( **25;8337;TOOLONG ) , the Nacrobats are a group of five South Side MCs  --  Pugslee Atomz , Infinito : 2017 , Cosmo Galactus , Thaione Davis and Psalm One  --  who have won serious props both individually and collectively over a 10-year career of varied recordings and intense stage shows . <p> A prime introduction to the group is last year 's " All Ways " album , the collective 's third release . Meanwhile , the individual members ' solo efforts number more than 35 at this point , with Psalm One winning the most acclaim . <p> 7 . PSALM ONE <p> One of the few female rappers making a name for herself in Chicago , Psalm One released her first solo album , " Bio:chemistry " ( appropriately titled , given her day job as a chemist ) in 2002 . She is preparing to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ant later this year . Birthwriter publicist Allen Johnson says the major labels are already sniffing around . <p> 8 . ANDREUS <p> South Side resident Deandrias Abdullah made a startlingly powerful debut earlier this year with " Street Troubadour " ( The Dialogue Group ) , a 12-track set of sharp , socially aware lyrics about the harsh realities of life on the streets paired with a sophisticated sound that blends elements of classic soul ( via Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield ) and cutting-edge hip-hop ( with a level of gritty , soulful musicianship that places him among kindred spirits such as Common and the Roots ) . <p> Following the mold of Prince or D'Angelo , the artist played most of the instruments on record himself ( including guitar , bass , percussion and keyboards ) , while on stage , a deft band provides solid musical backing for his impressive rhyming and pure , ringing and very Mayfield-like vocals . <p> 9 . REDSTORM <p> An old-school spoken word artist in the tradition of the pioneering Last Poets , RedStorm has been on the scene for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of heads , whether he 's delivering his cautionary street tales on his own ( infusing them with knowledge that was hard-earned during a stint in prison ) or with musical backing from Andreus . He was recently featured on HBO 's " Def Poetry " series , and he hopes to make his recorded debut later this year . <p> " The poetry/spoken word field is not a million-dollar field like rap , but I speak a real message about what I 've been through  --  the flip side of what everybody 's talking about on the records , " RedStorm says . " Kanye did that ' Jesus Walks ' thing , and that 's sort of on the level that I 'm on . I talk about the things that would n't normally be said  --  the drug addiction on the streets , the forgotten people in jail . " <p> 10 . WHITE BOY <p> From his controversial moniker ( which plays off his interracial background ) to his impressive victories as a battle rapper , 18-year-old Rockford native Chris Riley has made it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago 's independent ICEE Records ( a Christian label , which is a real rarity in the hip-hop and R &B; worlds ) , he is gearing up for the May 18 release of his debut album , " No Gray Area . " It features some high-profile star power , with tracks produced by Kanye West and house legend Maurice Joshua , and cameos from Kanye and Twista . <p> Pop music critic Jim DeRogatis co-hosts " Sound Opinions , " the world 's only rock ' n ' roll talk show , at 11 p.m .
