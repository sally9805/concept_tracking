In accepting the U.S. Catholic Award for Furthering the Cause of Women in the Church last October , Justice Anne M. Burke looks to the rich history of U.S. Catholicism for a vision of the church of the future . // Our common heritage as U.S. Catholics has never been more important or more threatened . We live in precariism , global warming , and urban street of confidence in the direction of our church , the truthfulness of its leadership , the role of the laity , and the persistent inability of the church to recognize our " Catholic place " in the modern world . This inability has wrought growing frustration for many , suspicions for others , and wide embarrassment for us all . As a well-educated Catholic and a professional woman , I am perplexed and dismayed . I am old enough to remember the bright promise that filled the air in the glory days of the second Vatican Council . Little did I suspect then , as a young woman with her whole life ahead of her , that 40 years later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The joy and hope , the grief and anguish of the men of our time , especially those who are poor or afflicted in any way , are the joy and hope , the grief and anguish of the followers of Christ as well . Nothing that is genuinely human fails to find an echo in their hearts . " Those words , crafted on the wings of the Holy Spirit in the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World 40 years ago electrified the church and a generation of believers . Gaudium et Spes was an explosion of hope in the future and the vehicle through which the church sought to recalibrate its self-understanding . It offered a natural excitement to U.S. Catholics because so much of that document 's substance flowed from our American Catholic experience . It was the age of John Courtney Murray , Xavier Rynne , and other American thinkers who brightened the interior of St. Peter 's with their ideas during that tumultuous time . Back at home decades of enlightened social leadership , particularly in places like the Archdiocese of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Egan , and the legions of clergy trained under the great Msgr . Reynold Hillenbrand , connected the laity to experiences of faith like Catholic Action , the Cana Conference , the Catholic Worker Movement , and Young Christian Students . The wisdom of this enlightenment touched people across the archdiocese and around the nation . Today , five years into the 21st century , I fear that the understanding of the church in the modern world presented by the second Vatican Council in Gaudium et Spes is under fire . I say that after my experience on the National Review Board of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops . I say that after looking under the tent . I say that after experiencing a loss of trust and a sad realization that only the worst crisis in the American church could bring the hierarchy to ask for direction and help from the laity . I do not for a minute believe that the bishops would have adopted either the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People and the norms for dealing with the abuse crisis or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to the bottom of the crisis had they not had their backs to the walls . Nor do I believe that without continuous scrutiny by the laity will the bishops refrain from tinkering with the burdens of justice and accountability placed on them by the charter . I have always seen the mission of our board and the difficult data that we uncovered as being a real work of the Holy Spirit . But I would be less than honest if I did not acknowledge how often many bishops fought us every inch of the way . Accountability continues to be a one-way street for many . Throughout the process I feared that once bishops found some breathing room from public outrage , largely because of what our board members were putting into place , some would think the coast was clear to roll back the clock . I was right . But power plays to sabotage accountability never worked , I 'm happy to say . Many bishops of real courage and reason prevented that from happening . // This art by M. P. Wiggins was specially commissioned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Award for Furthering the Cause of Women in the Church . // AS I try tO Understand what this experience means in my life , it has taken me a while to see the larger issues . Often in our work I thought of something that Father Donald Senior of Catholic Theological Union shared with me while we were butting heads with some of the bishops . He wisely said , " You know , Anne , it is n't their church or our church . It is Christ 's church . " I can not begin to tell you how often that ecclesiological truth saved me not just from imprudent words but even more importantly from my own despair . It is that understanding that helps sustain me when I see the concentrated effort from some in the church to retreat from the modern world . So traumatized has the institutional church been by the scandal of clerical sexual abuse and the ensuing confrontations in our nation , diocese by diocese , that I believe there are many in church leadership who want no part of the modern world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness that prevailed in many places before and after World War II . You may recall that world of moral absolutes and heavy hierarchical control . There was little interest in the role of the church in the modern world . Our vision was inward , not outward . Our relationship to other religious traditions carried little importance . A vast array of litmus tests-doctrinal , ecclesiastical , and educational-established the loyalty and trustworthiness of those entitled to steer the ship of Peter or even row the boat . I fear that those who are incapable of reading the signs of the times will attempt to carry us back to that lost moment . So I believe that you and I must commit ourselves to read the signs of the times for ourselves and respond as best we can , as the Lord has taught us . We must act with justice , generosity , and love ; with wisdom and sacrifice ; with candor and truthfulness ; with deep reason and with heart . Is this not something uniquely American ? Is this not what it means to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Review Board , we members traveled the length and breadth of America , from diocese to diocese , from one local church to another . This was an affirming and hope-filled experience . I came to a new and wider understanding of the life of the church here in our nation , particularly in the early days of the infant American Republic . It was a brilliant moment in our history . During those early days under the leadership of Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore , the Roman Catholic Church here was imbued with the inescapable wisdom of the Enlightenment . The church was unabashedly patriotic , boldly exuberant , courtly , thoughtful , scholarly , and an equal participant in this " great experiment in democracy . " It was a rich moment in American Catholic identity and one of the few eras in which we had little to apologize for or envy from the larger , dominant non-Catholic American culture . We were viewed by some with suspicion , of course , but ultimately our honor , our commitment to the American cause of freedom , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had what it took to be real citizens of the Republic . We are called to do great things in the world-feed the hungry , care for the sick , defend the vulnerable , shelter the homeless , and make peace real . There is , however , no mandate to hide the abusers or keep them near the defenseless . There is no mandate to jeopardize the resources of the church for the sake of the cover-up of crime . Sadly we will live for the rest of our lives with the damage from this scandal . But we can also alter the terrain and widen the opportunities for redemption . We must make room for everyone at the table and listen to those for whom the light , not the darkness , is the goal of our journey . Is this not the goal of the pastoral mission spelled out by Vatican II ? I am grateful for the opportunity I had to serve the church over my two and a half years on the National Review Board . It was a spiritual endeavor for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth is always a virtue . And the church is always cleansed by such virtue and made strong again by our commitment to the truth . More than 160 years ago , in the tragic aftermath of the American Civil War , Father Isaac Hecker , the founder of the Paulist Fathers , set out to transform the spirit of American Catholicism in a moment of national brokenness . The mission he set out to accomplish sought to heal and reconcile America . The impact he struggled to make was among the best and brightest of his generation of Americans . It was something that he had already experienced in his own life . He was a gift to lay Catholics , especially thinking Catholics . " The Catholic Church is my star , " he wrote , " which will lead me to my life , my destiny , my purpose . " What more could any of us ask ? I believe that the Catholic Church can be a star for all of us . IfI did not , I could not stand here tonight and look you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not have endured my two and a half years as a member of the National Review Board . IfI did not believe that the Catholic Church was " my star , " I am quite certain I would not have consented to get to the bottom of the most hurtful and disheartening crisis in the history of American Catholicism . We have COme a long way from debating the use of English in the Mass , or the appropriateness of guitars in church . Can you remember when these were big issues ? Now , in the time we have been given , we are challenged to resolve harder issues and harder hearts . Somewhere in it all abides the Advocate , the very breath of God 's Spirit . It is the Spirit who stirs up within us the resources we need to sustain one another . Remember , when things are at their worst , we are at our best . It is vital that Catholic organizations , especially the Catholic media , insist on expanded roles of significant leadership for the laity within the church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who believe in the ongoing mystery of grace , the life of God at work in human history . In spite of the long litany of horror that has befallen the Catholic Church , we believe that grace will transform the present not by magic but by our willingness to engage the truth . For ultimately , what the church has been engaged in these past 30-plus months since Dallas is the embrace of the truth-the often frightening reality of what humans are capable of creating for ourselves . Trie work of embracing the truth is also affirming , enriching , and life-giving . I hope that despite the shame , shock , pain , and anger , you judge us-the past and present members of the National Review Board-by what we do and say . Only this can free all of us from being prisoners of the past , its paralysis and its failure . We can change things , once we are willing to know them-heartache and all . It is in that spirit that I gratefully accept this award . Photograph Sidebar I feared that once bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast was clear to roll back the clock .
