<p> " Landmark , " the dictionary instructs us , is a building with " historical significance . " Now that the city is intent on designating the Daley Center for preservation ( news story , Jan. 5 ) , one can discern a disturbing pattern emerging in the Daley administration 's approach to public spaces . <p> The mayor a few weeks ago gave an enthusiastic endorsement to an outlandish design for the Grant Park band shell . That monstrosity , if actually built , would resemble a giant sardine can forced open with wire cutters . <p> The Daley Center is only a little less punishing to the eye . It is a glass slab that impudently elbowed its way into the neighborhood , ignoring the grace and beauty one finds across the street at City Hall , or one block over where the appellate judges sit ( 160 N. La Salle ) . <p> The truth is that this building , like most buildings erected in Chicago since World War II , is not very pretty . If its claimed role in carrying the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ignoring the past . Building boxes in the post-war International Style was well on its way in Chicago by 1965 ( Mies van der Rohe designed the IIT campus boxes in the 1940s ) , so there is little historical meaning in the erection of the Daley Center . <p> It remains simply one of the more conspicuous examples of the cold , banal design that has come to dominate American business centers . One sees it everywhere : Circle campus , La Salle Street , government buildings , corporate " woods " developments in edge towns such as Schaumburg , and , to its significant detriment , the Magnificent Mile . These edifices may be engineering marvels , and teem with life inside , but they exemplify a step backward in the urban aesthetic . <p> The fact that architecture in recent years has gone back to pre-war lines and structure  --  under the banner of post-Modernism  --  reflects a recognition that the kind of design thinking behind a Daley Center was a mistake . <p> Burr E. Anderson , Loop <p> Appalled by pickets <p> In response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " Jan. 5 ) , I think it is appalling that these Teamsters ( Local 727 ) have been picketing Donnellan Funeral Home for the last few months . While it is disturbing to me , it must be unbearable for the family members and friends who are visiting the funeral home . <p> I can not believe how these Teamsters followed the procession to the church , in order to picket outside the church . This really goes way beyond the bounds of common decency . I think these Teamsters need to place themselves into the shoes of the mourning family members . How would they feel if it were their mother , sister or aunt in that coffin ? <p> I am not saying that unions should not be allowed to picket . However , there is an appropriate time and place to do so . If the union has a gripe with the owners of Donnellan Funeral Home , then it should meet with the owners . <p> Personally , seeing Teamsters picket a funeral home will not make me more likely to choose a funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do just the opposite . <p> Karen Hoogland , Alsip <p> Repulsive behavior <p> The very thought of seeing pickets at a funeral gathering is both disgusting and repulsive to me . Are there no limits to the behavior of those who persist in trying to persuade others to share their views ? What has happened to sensitivity , decency and respect ? Losing a loved one is painful enough without being subjected to the unnecessary , cruel and senseless acts of others . <p> I.V . Sobol , Belmont Cragin <p> Millennium keepsake <p> The Sun-Times never ceases to amaze me : On Jan. 1 , you surpassed yourselves with page after page of " Welcome , 21st century "  --  absolutely superb . <p> Then to top it off , an extraordinary supplement : " Jan. 1 , 2000  --  A Keepsake Magazine . " <p> " 21st impressions  --  Chicago artists and Sun-Times writers predict how we will live , love , play and work in the 21st century . " <p> At 83 , I am one of your older readers . Reading the Sun-Times daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to . So when you present a remarkable issue such as this one to your readers , you should be complimented . Your work and research is very appreciated . It is our current history  --  I intend to keep all this for my heirs  --  and I hope they will have the sense to save it for theirs . <p> Katherine Guardi , Gage Park <p> Do what people want <p> When are politicians such as Mayor Daley and Gov . Ryan going to do as the people want ? Certainly the people want proper gun control . This is not the issue with these leaders . They do n't want gun control , they want gun confiscation ! There are thousands of gun-control laws on the books . Why do n't these politicians see that they are enforced ? <p> Daley files frivolous suits against law-abiding gun manufacturers just to harass them and force them to spend millions of dollars in legal fees to defend themselves from these underground , made-up charges . Again , why do n't these politicians see that existing gun laws are enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should disarm his bodyguards . Ryan says this is not a law to harass ordinary citizens or hunters . Of course it is ; that 's the whole reason for this impasse ! <p> None of this double-dealing and gun-control maneuvering would even be considered if there was not the incessant drumbeat to disarm the citizens by the liberal news media as typified by Neil Steinberg and Steve Neal , for example . The only crime that the NRA has committed is to stand firm in defense of constitutional law . I sometimes wonder whether these reporters/columnists have even heard of the Constitution and/or citizens ' guaranteed rights . <p> None of this contentiousness would be necessary if our elected officials would see that existing gun laws were enforced . This wo n't happen until the electorate forces them to do so , since politicians are interested only in those actions that keep them in office . <p> The Second Amendment gives citizens the right to keep and bear arms . If these self-appointed dictators can not negate this constitutional right , they will see that laws such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the people under one excuse or another , such as " protecting the public . " There is no need to make carrying a gun a felony ( unlawful use is another matter ) for the law to be effective . In Chicago , it is unlawful to own a gun , so its citizens are at the mercy of the criminals . The politicians have made certain that only law-abiding , honest , ordinary citizens ca n't get guns without a lot of harassment , and they are the ones who need guns for protection that the politicians are not providing ! For a change , Senate President James " Pate " Philip is absolutely right on this one . <p> J. Edward Knowles , Barrington <p> Mankind prevails <p> Thank God that this Y2K mania is all over with ! It 's amazing how otherwise rational , intelligent people could be so easily brainwashed into believing that the world was nearing a tragic end . Did n't they know that mankind was around long before computers were invented , and that mankind will still be around when computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ! <p> Joseph Daudish , Westchester <p> Shedd staff lauded <p> A judicious and impartial editorial ( Dec. 30 ) rightfully lamented the death of beluga whales while also emphasizing the conscientious , dedicated professionals affiliated with the Shedd Aquarium . These vigilant marine biologists and nature proponents never want to witness the untimely death of a magnificent species . <p> In a world where barbaric slaughterhouses , hunting and poaching continue to thrive , animal welfare advocates should realize their allies toil at humane sanctuaries exemplified by the Shedd . <p> Brien Comerford , Glenview <p> Irresponsible choice <p> I find the use of Monica Lewinsky as a spokeswoman for Jenny Craig a totally irresponsible promotion by Jenny Craig management . Lewinsky should not be seen as anything less than an embarrassment to herself and this country for her conduct while an intern in the White House . This embarrassing behavior is the only reason we know who she is  --  end of story . <p> Wendy Jones , Calumet Park <p> Correction <p> Due to an editing error , attribution was left out of a letter ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of judges would be no better than the current elections . The letter should have read : <p> ( Winston ) Churchill once said that messy democracy is the worst form of government but it is better than all the rest . The open primary and election system is conducive of a measure of judicial independence , and even the randomness of the process works to that end . This independence from political and governmental power was at the heart of the founding fathers ' concept of the judiciary . Although federal judges are appointed ( by the executive , precisely to promote independence ) , the " complete independence of the courts of justice " from " the legislature and the executive " in the Constitution precluded , even for federal judges , anything like retention by commissions ( Federalist Papers , No. 78 ) . <p> Mark McGuire , West Town
