Last week Hillary Clinton was a better mayor of New York City than the man who holds the job . Commenting on the most recent killing of an unarmed man , Patrick Dorismond , by an undercover narcotics cop , Clinton told a congregation at the Bethel A.M.E. Church , " I do not believe that bad relations with the police is a necessary cost of doing the business of keeping our cities safe . " She went on to criticize Mayor Rudy Giuliani directly : " If he is leading the rush to judgment in New York , how can we trust him to exercise good judgment in Washington ? " <P> Winning the Senate race in New York may not come from Clinton or Giuliani doing well but from one of them doing badly . By that measure , Giuliani 's reaction to the latest police killing , the fourth of an unarmed black man in 13 months , gave Clinton her best campaign week yet . Giuliani typically springs to the cops ' defense . But this time he would n't even express sympathy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the shooting was unjustified . " He had no compunctions about implying that the shooting was justified . Dorismond was " no altar boy , " Giuliani reported , as if all non-altar boys are subject to summary execution on the sidewalks of New York . The slain security guard had behaved in a way that was " very aggressive toward the police , " he added , though there was no proof that Dorismond did anything except perhaps annoy the plainclothes narcotics cop by rebuffing his attempt to buy marijuana . Giuliani also asserted that Dorismond had spent a " good deal of his adult life punching people , " a reference to a domestic complaint filed by Dorismond 's girlfriend , which resulted in no charge against him . Though Giuliani released Dorismond 's adult and juvenile records ( the latter are supposed to remain sealed ) , they revealed that he had never been convicted of anything more serious than disorderly conduct . At the same time , Giuliani praised Anthony Vasquez , the officer who shot Dorismond , as a " very , very distinguished undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no altar boy himself ; he once shot a neighbor 's dog and pulled out his revolver during a personal altercation at a bar . <P> As his weeklong campaign against Dorismond aroused criticism rather than quieted it , Giuliani stopped holding his daily press briefings at city hall and refused to meet with the black community , saying the killing of Dorismond , a Haitian , had " nothing to do with race . " By Thursday , the Rev. Jesse Jackson had chimed in , claiming that the New York City mayor is " not only mean ; he is becoming mental ... His reaction to the killing of unarmed people is irresponsible . " Giuliani said he expected such carping from " the political pile-on team captained by Al Sharpton for Hillary Clinton . " <P> But what he may not have expected was criticism from his own ranks . Long Island Republican Congressman Peter King , the son of a cop who will eventually endorse Giuliani , said , " Rudy is a great wartime mayor . But once he got rid of murderers and squeegee men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't stop himself . Obviously , the cop made a mistake here , but the mayor ca n't acknowledge it . " Former Giuliani aide and Republican National Committee chairman Rich Bond worried out loud that Giuliani 's strong defense in this particular case could turn what has been a huge positive for the mayor  --  his record on crime  --  into a negative .
