Into the woods A stand of second-growth redwoods defines the irregular boundary of this small , elevated deck that stretches out- y ward from a concrete patio . A sectional failing with inset panels of safety glass borders the highest edge , while an L-shaped bench adds seating and safety along another edge . Steps lead down to the forest floor . DESIGN : Marilyn and Terry Boyd , Ben Lomond , CA Photograph // Our contest winners prove that the best decks take inspiration from their sites Although all decks create flat outdoor-living space . not all decks serve the same functions , as our winners vividly demonstrate . One weaves through a grove of trees . Another helps tame a sloping site by dividing it into unstable stairstepping levels , complete with built-in planters and a barbecue area . Still others function as " satellite ' decks-important visual elements in the garden , as well as inviting , serence destinations separated from the noise and light of the house . Out collection shows that decks can be as varied as the topography they cover . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a deck 's long life and lasting beauty . Here 's a care guide for decks made of conventional wood or pressure-treated lumber . Decks constructed of such wood alternatives as Trex or TimberTech require less maintenance , but be sure to inspect their underpinnings-which are often built with pressure-treated lumber-for signs of dry rot or mildew . 1 . Clean the deck . Remove debris from between the boards . Leaves , twigs , and rocks can trap moisture and lead to dry-rot problems . Use a commercial deck cleaning solution or make a mixture of 1 gallon of water and 1 cup of household bleach and a little powdered laundry detergent . ( Note : Do not combine bleach with any detergent containing ammonia . ) Wet the deck with a hose and scrub on the solution with a stiff-bristled broom ( to avoid rust stains , do not use steel wool or a wire brush ) , Spray clean and let dry . Thoroughly rinse any adjacent plant material . 2 . Reset loose nails or screws . As wood swells and shrinks with moisture and heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer and a broad nailset to drive any popped nail heads below the surface of the deck . ( it 's a good idea to punch all the nail heads below the surface  --  especially if you are planning to sand an older deck . ) In addition , check other fasteners on the deck 's frame , rim joists , and stairs . 3 . Check for mildew and dry rot ( often found underneath the deck where there is wood-to-wood contact ) . If you find an affected area , scrub it with a brush and detergent , apply household bleach to kill any spores , and rinse with water . 4 . Remove nail rust stains . After setting nail heads below the deck surface , clean the surface with a dilute mixture of oxalic acid ( 1 ounce per quart of water ) . Wear gloves and avoid skin or eye contact . 5 . Restore original wood color . The gray color of a weathered wood deck is the result of the sun 's ultraviolet light breaking down a natural chemical ( called lignin ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original color , you must remove the " dead " fiber using a cleaner ( such as Woodwash , a biodegradable cleaner from Napier Environmental Technologies ; 800/8585011 or www.biowash.com ) or a power-washer with a wide spray head . ( Wear goggles and hold sprayer at least 6 inches away from deck 's surface. ) 6 . Seal deck . Choose a water-repellent wood preservative with UV inhibitors and a mildewcide . Such sealers , available clear or slightly tinted , soak into the wood rather than sit upon its surface . Depending on manufacturer , they last from one to three years . Semitransparent or solid-body finishes are longer lasting but have a less natural appearance .

At the rear , a bold torii creates a graphic backdrop that anchors the garden .

Design elements include curving fascia boards that mask the underpinnings of the deck , gently curving steps , and a J-shaped bench . To face one end of the bench , they cut short vertical strips with beveled edges from the fascia board ; the other end they wrapped with fascia board . DESIGN : Dawna Jackson and and Dave Sanford , Boise Photograph Ladder for living This multilevel deck has six separate conversation and dining areas created with retaining walls and built-in planters . At the time of construction , stair railings were not required because no more than three steps separate levels . Broad benches on the upper levels provide safety . Lift-tops turn the benches into storage compartments for deck accessories . DESIGN : Ernest Delto , Architect , Glenwood Springs , CO ; ( 970 ) 945-8921 A place apart Owners Lu and Roger Buranen designed and built this two-level deck , approximately 18 by 26 feet , to replace a small , uninviting concrete patio that once stood outside their kitchen . Just two steps above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elegantly defined by an open railing , a small torii , and a bamboo fountain . Lowvoltage lights built into the tops of the railing posts make this area particularly inviting at dusk . The deck is constructed from a handsome and durable hardwood called ipe ( Brazilian ironwood ) . DESIGN : Lu and Roger Buranen , Fircrest , WA // <p>
