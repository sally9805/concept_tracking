An American Dilemma : // " An Astonishing Ignorance . . . " // The winter of 1940 was a cruel one for Gunnar Myrdal , and spring was shaping up even worse . He was in the United States , finishing the research on the most comprehensive study yet of race relations and the condition of Negroes in America . But he was having trouble reaching conclusions , and he struggled to outline and conceptualize the writing . " The whole plan is now in danger of breaking down , " he wrote the Carnegie Foundation , which was underwriting his project . // What ? s more , the gathering crisis in Europe had thrown him into a depression ; he feared for the very existence of his native Sweden . In April , Nazi Germany had invaded Denmark and Norway . Myrdal believed Sweden would be next . He put aside more than two years of work by 125 researchers and began arranging passage home for himself , his wife , Alva , and their three children . He and Alva wanted to fight alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found , the Mathilda Thorden , a Finnish freighter , was laden with explosives , and the captain tried to dissuade the Myrdals from boarding the dangerous ship . When this failed , the captain jokingly urged Myrdal to look on the bright side . He would not have to worry about his family freezing to death in icy waters . If German U-boats attacked , the resulting explosion would almost certainly kill everyone instantly . // The U-boats did not attack , and the Myrdals arrived in Sweden only to be appalled by what was happening there . Rather than preparing for war with Germany , the Swedish government was seeking an accommodation with the Nazis . // Knowing that Germany was monitoring the Swedish press for anti-German sentiment , the government first confiscated copies of anti-Nazi newspapers ; then , emboldened , it interfered with the distribution of one of the nation ? s most important dailies , G ? teborgs Handelstidning . This , Myrdal believed , could not happen in America . He was outraged . " The press is strangled , " he wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets written about Germany . News is suppressed . " 1 // There and then , Myrdal ? s understanding of America and its race relations became crystallized . In a book that quickly took precedence over his Carnegie project , then became its seed , Gunnar and Alva Myrdal wrote Kontakt med Amerika ( Contact with America ) , which was crafted largely to rally Swedish resistance against Hitler . In Kontakt , published in 1941 , the Myrdals argued that Swedes had much to learn from America about democracy , dialogue , and self-criticism . " The secret , " they wrote , " is that America , ahead of every other country in the whole Western world , large or small , has a living system of expressed ideals for human cooperation which is unified , stable and clearly formulated . " 2 The Carnegie project , they added , was evidence of America ? s willingness to sanction a sweeping examination and discussion of a national problem . // Almost all of America ? s citizens , the Myrdals said , believed in free speech and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly disagreed . As a result , diverse ethnic groups were living with one another in peace while Europe was tearing itself apart . // Before writing Kontakt , Myrdal didn ? t have the insight or context he needed for his weightier book on race in America . Nor did he have the words he felt would serve as the road map to change . Three years earlier , in 1938 , he had reached the South , the dark side of the moon . There , he had found an enigmatic , sometimes exotic , always deeply divided and repressive society whose behavior was known to , but overlooked by , the world beyond . In pursuit of an understanding and insight that was still beyond his grasp , his immersion had been total , the details of his discoveries had been staggering , and he had come to a point where he was no longer horrified by the pathology of racism or stunned by the cruelty and pervasiveness of discrimination . He had found himself fascinated by the way an entire social order had been built , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrdal frequently found himself feeling oddly optimistic about attitudes he found despicable , and he was moving , somewhat unwittingly , toward the conclusion that would become the core definition of his landmark work , An American Dilemma : that Americans , for all their differences , for all their warring and rivalries , were bound by a distinct " American creed , " a common set of values that embodied such concepts as fair play and an equal chance for everyone . He was coming to that view in the unlikeliest of settings . He had been able to sit with the rapaciously racist U.S. senator from Mississippi Theodore Bilbo , listen to his proposal for shipping Negroes back to Africa , ask why he hadn ? t proposed instead that they be sterilized , and come away uplifted by Bilbo ? s answer . " American opinion would never allow it , " Bilbo had told him . " It goes against all our ideals and the sentiments of the people . " 3 // But for all his excitement , information , and knowledge , Myrdal remained mystified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhumanity toward Negroes been allowed to exist for so long into the twentieth century ? Why didn ? t anyone outside the South know ? If they did know , why didn ? t they do something about it ? Who could do something about it ? Who would ? Where would the leadership for change come from ? // Myrdal returned to the United States and his racial study in 1941 , brimming with the insights he would need for An American Dilemma to have an impact on the country.4 Seeing his homeland ? s willingness to trade freedoms for security of another kind , Myrdal came to appreciate the vital role the American press could play in challenging the status quo of race relations . // In Sweden , newspapers wanted to report the news but were blocked by the government . In America , the First Amendment kept the government in check , but the press , other than black newspapers and a handful of liberal southern editors , simply didn ? t recognize racism in America as a story . The segregation of the Negro in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and economic stratification in the North , had engulfed the press as well as America ? s citizens . The mainstream American press wrote about whites but seldom about Negro Americans or discrimination against them ; that was left to the Negro press . // Myrdal had a clear understanding of the Negro press ? s role in fostering positive discontent . He saw the essential leadership role that southern moderate and liberal white editors were playing by speaking out against institutionalized race discrimination , yet he was aware of the anguish they felt as the pressure to conform intensified . There was also the segregationist press in the South that dehumanized Negroes in print and suppressed the biggest story in their midst . And he came to see the northern press  --  and the national press , such as it was  --  as the best hope for force-feeding the rest of the nation a diet so loaded with stories about the cruelty of racism that it would have to rise up in protest . // " The Northerner does not have his social conscience and all his political thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Myrdal wrote in the second chapter of An American Dilemma . " Rather , he succeeds in forgetting about it most of the time . The Northern newspapers help him by minimizing all Negro news , except crime news . The Northerners want to hear as little as possible about the Negroes , both in the South and in the North , and they have , of course , good reasons for that . // " The result is an astonishing ignorance about the Negro on the part of the white public in the North . White Southerners , too , are ignorant of many phases of the Negro ? s life , but their ignorance has not such a simple and unemotional character as that in the North . There are many educated Northerners who are well informed about foreign problems but almost absolutely ignorant about Negro conditions both in their own city and in the nation as a whole . " 5 // Left to their own devices , white people in America would want to keep it that way , Myrdal wrote . They ? d prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are criminal and of disgustingly , but somewhat enticingly , loose sexual morals ; that they are religious and have a gift for dancing and singing ; and that they are the happy-go- lucky children of nature who get a kick out of life which white people are too civilized to get . " 6 // Myrdal concluded that there was one barrier between the white northerner ? s ignorance and his sense of outrage that the creed was being poisoned . That barrier was knowledge , incontrovertible information that was strong enough , graphic enough , and constant enough to overcome " the opportunistic desire of the whites for ignorance . " // " A great many Northerners , perhaps the majority , get shocked and shaken in their conscience when they learn the facts , " Myrdal wrote . " The average Northerner does not understand the reality and the effects of such discriminations as those in which he himself is taking part in his routine of life . " // Then , underscoring his point in italics , Myrdal reached the conclusion that would prove to be uncannily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his tome , he wrote , " To get publicity is of the highest strategic importance to the Negro people . " // He added , " There is no doubt , in the writer ? s opinion , that a great majority of white people in America would be prepared to give the Negro a substantially better deal if they knew the facts . " 7 // The future of race relations , Myrdal believed , rested largely in the hands of the American press . // An American Dilemma was both a portrait of segregation and a mirror in which an emerging generation of southerners would measure themselves . In a few short years , the book would have a personal impact on a core group of journalists , judges , lawyers , and academicians , who , in turn , would exercise influence on race relations in the South over the next two decades . The book would become a cornerstone of the Supreme Court ? s landmark verdict against school segregation a full decade later , and it would become a touchstone by which progressive journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South had come , how far it had to go , and the extent of their roles and responsibilities . // The Myrdal investigation was so incisive and comprehensive  --  monumental , even  --  that it would for many years remain a mandatory starting point for anyone seriously studying race in the United States . Its timing was perfect . Most of its fieldwork occurred in the three years before the United States entered World War II , a period in which segregation in the South was as rigid as it ever got . The book ran 1,483 pages long yet was a distillation of a raw product that included 44 monographs totaling 15,000 pages.8 // More remarkable than the study ? s impact was its foresight . The coming years would prove , time and again , the extraordinary connection between news coverage of race discrimination  --  publicity , as Myrdal called it  --  and the emerging protest against discrimination  --  the civil rights movement , as it became known . That movement grew to be the most dynamic American news story of the last half of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the news media  --  another phrase that did not exist at the time  --  more influential than they were in the 1950s and 1960s , sometimes for better , sometimes for worse . From the news coverage came significant and enduring changes not only in the civil rights movement but also in the way the print and television media did their jobs . There is little in American society that was not altered by the civil rights movement . There is little in the civil rights movement that was not changed by the news coverage of it . And there is little in the way the news media operate that was not influenced by their coverage of the movement . // An American Dilemma began with a decision by the Carnegie Corporation to conduct a comprehensive study of race in America , and especially of segregation and white supremacy in the South . Recalling the contribution of Alexis de Tocqueville , a Frenchman , in his book Democracy in America , the foundation decided its racial study should be headed by a non-American scholar from a country with no history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Myrdal declined the Carnegie offer . He was , after all , a member of the House of the Swedish Parliament , the rough equivalent of the U.S. Senate . He was also a director of the national bank at a moment when Sweden was hobbled by economic depression . He would have to resign both positions and take leave from a prestigious chair in economics at the University of Stockholm , where he was considered one of the nation ? s most brilliant academics . What ? s more , the Myrdals had recently found an ideological home and leadership positions in the reform policies of the Social Democratic Party , which favored social engineering and economic planning . // He was fluent in English and no stranger to the United States . He and Alva , a psychologist , had been fellows in the Rockefeller Foundation ? s social science program in 1929-30 . He had refused the Rockefeller Foundation traveling fellowship for himself until the foundation agreed to make Alva a fellow as well.9 No one at the foundation had reason to regret the deal . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the program ? s great successes and recommended him with enthusiasm to Frederick P. Keppel , president of the Carnegie Corporation . // After saying no , Myrdal changed his mind , but only on the condition that he have complete control over planning the study . The foundation agreed . Myrdal became enthusiastic . " I shall work on the Negro  --  I will do nothing else , " he wrote . " I shall think and dream of the Negro 24 hours a day . . . . &amp; //
