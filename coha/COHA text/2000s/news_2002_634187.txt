<p> It seemed more than appropriate that Tony Amonte was holding a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts  --  a snack he had just purchased for teammates to eat on the bus to the airport  --  when we were talking Thursday after the team 's practice in Phoenix . <p> After all , we were discussing Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz 's cheaper-by-the-dozen approach to filling the hole in the team 's roster this summer . <p> Amonte said he was unaware of last week 's news that the team already has decided not to re-sign him when he becomes an unrestricted free agent after the season . Insiders say the Hawks again have decided they can replace Amonte with two or three lesser players whose salaries will total well under what they would have to pay Amonte . <p> It is a strategy that was followed when other stars , such as Jeremy Roenick , Ed Belfour and Chris Chelios , asked the Hawks to ante up market value for their services . <p> Amonte admitted the news did not shock him . With the way he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he already had resigned himself to the fact he is playing his last 14 regular-season games as a member of the Hawks and in the city he has loved since being dealt here eight years ago on trade-deadline day . <p> Amonte said he told agent Mike Gillis weeks ago that the Hawks would not discuss an extension after the season . <p> Because everyone knows the Hawks have no interest in coming close to the five-year , $40 million deal Amonte likely will get , the wonder is why the Hawks have decided not to trade him by the deadline Tuesday . <p> If we were to suspend all that Hawks history has taught us  --  and buy into Wirtz 's silly statement that he always has weighed winning more than profits when it came to his hockey team  --  trading Amonte to another contending team would seem to be a no-brainer . <p> After all , Wirtz recently said the team has a plan to build around young talent and stick to its middling payroll , which is cast in iron . " <p> So picking up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , similar to the deal for Chelios on deadline day three years ago , does not fit into Wirtz 's ballyhooed plan for the future ? <p> Or does picking up Chris Drury from the Colorado Avalanche or Jamie Langenbrunner from the Dallas Stars in a package deal for Amonte just not have the same ring as the box-office cash register during two rounds or more of playoffs this spring ? Four or more home games  --  worth $1 million or more each in pure profit to Wirtz  --  that wo n't happen if Amonte is gone . <p> Not trading Amonte now is simply another short-sighted management move by Wirtz , an owner of a team whose fans always have to take a back seat to the team 's bank account . <p> If Wirtz were to poll his season-ticket holders  --  the same smart people he discredits by believing they do not think for themselves and only follow what newspaper columnists say  --  he likely would find out that they could live with trading Amonte now , assuming the deal was good enough to ensure the Hawks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waiting for 41 years since the Hawks last won the Cup has produced plenty of patience among the team 's faithful . <p> With what coach Brian Sutter has achieved this season , we wo n't entirely rule out a Stanley Cup run this season , no matter how long the odds appear . And with Wirtz making money moves over winning ones , those odds are every bit as long as Amonte being back next season . <p> TRADE TALK : History shows the final hours before the NHL trading deadline at 2 p.m . Tuesday will feature a flurry of activity . <p> On deadline day over the last three seasons , there have been 50 deals , involving 84 players . Last season , 31 players were moved in 17 trades on deadline day . <p> The Toronto Maple Leafs got a relatively early start Friday , acquiring goalie Tom Barrasso , who will be 37 on March 31 , from the Carolina Hurricanes for a fourth-round pick in next year 's draft . The Leafs took a pass on two other veteran goalies , Mike Vernon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of their contracts . Either could have been claimed off waivers . <p> The biggest name making the rounds as the deadline nears is Pavel Bure of the Florida Panthers . The Dallas Stars and New York Rangers appear to have the most interest , though the Stars denied reports last week they have offered Brenden Morrow and Jamie Langenbrunner for Bure . <p> The Stars reportedly were talking Friday to the Washington Capitals about a deal for Peter Bondra . The Capitals reportedly have pulled Adam Oates , the league 's assist leader , off the market . <p> Though their scouts reportedly have advised against trading for the self-centered talent , the Rangers still seem to have interest in Bure , who reportedly wants out of Florida so much he would restructure his contract  --  worth $10 million per season  --  to accommodate a deal . <p> The Panthers ' asking price is steep for Bure , who has underachieved ( 21 goals and 45 points through Thursday ) . Panthers general manager Chuck Fletcher reportedly asked the Rangers for Petr Nedved or Mike York along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , and defenseman Mike Mottau . <p> The Rangers are also interested in Edmonton Oilers defenseman Tom Poti , who turns 25 on Friday and has commanded a lot of attention for a player who has one goal and 15 assists . The New York Islanders and Boston Bruins also are bidding for Poti , who will be moved by Tuesday . <p> Other defensemen being offered are the Columbus Blue Jackets ' Lyle Odelein , the Vancouver Canucks ' Scott Lachance and the Panthers ' Robert Svehla . The Pittsburgh Penguins insist that neither defenseman Darius Kasparaitis nor center Robert Lang are available , though they might be moved by Tuesday . <p> ODDS A MILE HIGH : Colorado Avalanche fans looking for another of the team 's trademark monster moves near the deadline likely will be disappointed . Though the Avalanche would love a high-scoring forward such as the Blackhawks ' Tony Amonte or the Bruins ' Bill Guerin , those two seem unavailable . And with its 7-1-1 run of late , the Avalanche just might bide its time until Peter Forsberg returns . The forward had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , has been working out and might return ahead of schedule . <p> QUOTEWORTHY : If sarcasm is any indication , Anaheim goalie Steve Shields did n't care for the trade the Mighty Ducks made March 5 , when veteran forward Marty McInnis was sent to the Bruins for a future draft pick . Said Shields to reporters as they entered the dressing room : If you 're looking for the guy we got , he 'll be here in four years . " <p> ONE AND ONLY <p> Corey Schwab , Maple Leafs : Entering the weekend , Toronto 's backup goalie had allowed an average of one goal per game in his last four starts . During that stretch , the Maple Leafs were unbeaten with a 2-0-2 record . Schwab had started eight games in a row since Curtis Joseph broke a finger Feb. 26 . Still , that did not stop the Leafs from trading for another goalie , Carolina Hurricanes veteran Tom Barrasso , on Friday . <p> DETROIT DRIVE <p> Steve Yzerman , Red Wings : The team 's captain skated Wednesday and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been battling an injured right knee , which has kept him off the ice since he played on Canada 's gold-medal-winning team at the Olympics . He hopes to play either Tuesday or Thursday . Yzerman had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Jan. 28 and played two games before the Olympics . <p> DEVIL DEALING <p> Bobby Holik , Devils : New Jersey again has started to talk about a contract extension with its forward , who is expected to be one of the top four free agents available this summer . The team negotiated last week with Holik 's agent , Mike Gillis , who also represents Blackhawks forward Tony Amonte , another in that elite free-agent foursome . Holik has instructed Gillis not to involve him unless the talks result in a serious offer .
