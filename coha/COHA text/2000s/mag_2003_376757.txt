Stacey Hoffman , 32 , was n't always a babe . Two years ago , when she drove her pickup truck into an auto-window-tinting shop owned by Kevin May in Lincoln , Neb. , May , six years her senior , barely noticed her . Then an aide at a nearby nursing home and mired in a rocky , miserable relationship , Stacey weighed 180 lbs. , deeply disliked the sight of her own face and did n't exactly radiate self-confidence . She did n't radiate much of anything , except perhaps a conviction that she looked 50 and would never be as happy or as attractive as Lisa , her bikini-contest-winning kid sister . The only detail May remembers about Stacey 's visit to his shop that day is that she ordered a set of floor mats and never returned to pick them up . <P> In the period since that non-meeting , though , something happened  --  something out of a postmodern fairy tale that finally caused Kevin to pay attention and set Stacey 's life on a fresh course . Thanks to the plastic surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hit ABC TV series Extreme Makeover , homely Stacey became a raving beauty . After $18,000 worth of liposuction procedures , brow and eye lifts , Botox injections and dental work , Stacey went home to Nebraska from Hollywood an astonishing 35 lbs . lighter and looking like a newly minted pop star . In no time , her troublesome boyfriend was history and May , who glimpsed her again at a local street dance , was in hot pursuit . There were a few glitches , though : her 6-year-old niece Alexis failed to recognize her , and her co-workers at the nursing home resented her new image , she contends , and caused her to change jobs . <P> It has been more than a year since Stacey 's transformation , time enough to assess its early consequences for her and those around her . Her story , like those of other recipients of Extreme Makeover 's aesthetic magic , shows that when ugly ducklings become swans ( particularly if surgery is involved ) ruffled feathers can ensue , not to mention a fair amount of swelling  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce inspiring fables , the program plays down these complications , but they 're real , and they raise important questions . Can human beings really change from the outside in ? Does suddenly looking like a million bucks alienate those who ca n't afford to ? And after the free limo ride is over , how easy is it to maintain a face and body granted by the whims of the TV gods ? <P> " Everything about me was round . I just felt like a snowman , " says Dan Restione , 41 , a Seattle radio producer whose makeover last summer took six weeks and could have cost him an estimated $80,000 if he 'd had to pay for it . For that kind of money , Dan deserved bionic superpowers , but what he got  --  a slimmed-down torso , a more prominent chin , sculpted cheeks , a fuller hairline , and teeth as white as Aspen after a blizzard  --  made him feel like an " action hero , " he says , and lifted him out of a multiyear depression that had followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some superficial happiness , it was the teeth-grinding , chain-smoking Dan , who dubs his premakeover self the " king of cynics.
