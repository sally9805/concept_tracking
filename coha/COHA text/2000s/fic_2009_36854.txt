There will be time , there will be time <p> To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet <p>  --  T. S. Eliot <p> Henning , Colorado , Friday Afternoon <p> The woman was trouble . <p> Ian Buchanan knew it the second he set eyes on her as she climbed out of a banged-up , dust-covered , dark blue rental . Knew it as he set down his hammer , watching her walk toward him , her small frame backlit by the burning orange glow of the sweltering afternoon sun while she carefully made her way through the rugged terrain of the building site . <p> And the first words out of that soft , pink mouth  --  her lips glossy and sweet looking , voice mellow with a sexy , husky little rasp to it  --  confirmed his suspicions . <p> " Mr. Buchanan , my name is Molly Stratton and I 'm here because well , I know this sounds crazy , but your mother , Elaina , asked me to come and find you . " <p> She did n't laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the biggest pair of brown eyes he 'd ever seen . Waiting . <p> " Is that right ? " He ignored her small outstretched hand while he pushed his sunglasses up on top of his head , picked up his Coors , and took a long swallow of the beer . The glass rim of the longneck was cool against his sweat-salted lips , the beer even cooler as it went down his dry throat in a long , icy glide . She watched him while he drank , her dark gaze snagging on the column of his throat as it worked . A soft wash of pink warmed the delicate crest of her pale , freckle-dusted cheekbones as she stared , those full lips parted the barest fraction . Something down low in Ian 's belly cramped in reaction . His blood went thick . <p> Oh , yeah , she was trouble , all right . <p> Ticked at himself for reacting so easily to her , he set the bottle back down on top of his battered cooler with a distinct thud , noting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harshness of the sound . <p> She was nervous  --  and obviously crazy as hell . Either that , or a pathetic little con , looking for an easy score . <p> " So tell me , sunshine , " he drawled , injecting just the right amount of ridicule into his deep voice . " You talk to the dead often , or is today just my lucky day ? " <p> Reaching up to hook her windblown hair behind her left ear , she held his hard gaze without so much as a flicker of those long , thick lashes rimming the deep cinnamon brown of her eyes . " As a matter of fact , I do . How often depends on them not me . " <p> Ian stared at her while those strange words played through his mind . She 'd stopped just a few feet away from where he stood , her gaze both shy and direct in that way that always captured a man 's attention . The bristling Colorado mountain breeze played havoc with her shoulder-length , honey-blond curls , carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and something hot caught fire in his blood , like a burning glow heating him from within . Even down deep , in those forgotten places where things always stayed cool and calmand lifeless  --  where nothing and no one could touch him  --  he sensed an uncomfortable spark of awareness . <p> Dropping his sunglasses back down to shield his eyes , Ian picked up his hammer and went back to work , bracing the wall he 'd just raised . He no longer held her gaze , but he still felt her , like a fine tension that vibrated from her body to his own , its rhythm rapid and quivering . <p> What the hell ? <p> " I know it soundsimpossible , " she added , " but it 's true . " <p> Yeah , sure it was . <p> " Do n't they have medication for people like you , Miss Stratton ? " he asked with a heavy dose of sarcasm , determined to ignore herthe heatthe irritating beads of sweat snaking down his spine beneath the damp cotton of his T-shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gut . " What 'd you do , miss a dose ? " <p> " I 'm not psychotic or delusional . " She sighed , sounding tired . Weary even . " And I 'm not after your money or  --  " <p> " Good , " he grunted with a low laugh , his grin crooked as he glanced up at her through the dark shield of his glasses , " because I ai n't got any . Would you believe I blew every cent I own on the Psychic Friends Network ? " <p> She frowned , but determination etched the delicate angles of her face , giving her the illusion of being tough , when he knew instinctively that she was anything but . Crazy ? Obviously . But there was something vulnerable and soft in her that fascinated the hell out of him . <p> God , he was so fucked . <p> " Look , I realize this seems like some kind of joke to you , but I 'm not trying to scam you , " she murmured , her left hand fidgeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waistband of her jeans . " I really do n't want your money or anything else . The only thing I 'm asking is that you pay attention to what I have to tell you . " <p> " Now see , " he replied in a slow slide of words worthy of any natural-born Southerner , " the problem is that I 'm too much of a bastard to pay you even that . " He pointed the hammer in the direction of her car , needing her gone . Now . Before he gave in and forgot why bedding her would be such a bad idea . " So why do n't you just hightail your crazy little ass out of Henning and back to wherever it is you came from . " <p> A soft sound of irritation rumbled in her chest , making him grin despite himself . It was refreshing to know that little miss innocent looking had a temper , and he found himself wondering what she looked like when that passionate temper was truly riled . <p> Sweat popped out on his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them in waves from the sweltering ground  --  and everything to do with the feminine package standing before him . It was his own fault , but he 'd been too long without a woman . Now he was in a bad way , and Ian knew he should 've ignored his waning interest and dropped by Kendra Wilcox 's earlier in the week . If he 'd gone ahead and gotten laid , then maybe he would n't be getting geared up over the strange little female standing in front of him , talking about conversations with his mother 's ghost . <p> " Look , Mr. Buchanan . If forgetting about this whole thing was an option , then believe me , I would . Unfortunately , it is n't . I 've no other choice than to follow through with this , whether you act like an arrogant jerk or a gentleman . " <p> Mumbling around the nail he 'd just placed between his lips , Ian arched one brow . " Much to my mother 's heartache , I never did take to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fateful afternoon I put a frog down Sally Simpson 's pants in kindergarten , " he informed her , setting the nail in place . He flashed her an unrepentant smile , getting a perverse pleasure out of pushing her buttons . " And I 've never changed . " <p> " And you sound remarkably proud of that fact . " Her voice held a hint of challenge that twisted the irritating hunger in his gut a notch tighter , and he nearly smashed his thumb as he swung down on the nail head . " A rebel through and through . " <p> " Which really should n't come as a surprise , " he rumbled softly . " If you 're so chatty with my mother , then I 'm sure she 's already warned you that I 'm a stubborn son of a bitch . You 're wasting your time here , Molly . " <p> The use of her first name had her blinking with an odd look of surprise . And damn , but if he did n't feel that strange little jolt between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Something too intimate for comfort . He did n't know why he 'd used her first name , but he could n't deny that he liked the way it felt on his lips . <p> " She 's told me enough for me to know that you 'd be less than cooperative , " she answered after a moment , while the wind picked up , molding the soft cotton of her plain white shirt to a petite pair of high , rounded breasts . " She also warned me that you 'd react this way . " <p> Ian cut her a sharp look from behind his dark lenses , but bit back an even sharper retort . It was twisted , but the harder she pushed him , the more he wanted her . <p> " So , we can either go ahead and have this conversation here , " she pressed on with firm conviction , taking advantage of his silence , " or I can follow you around night and day until you give in and listen to what I have to say . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " <p> Bent over , his weight resting on one arm while he held the hammer in the other hand , Ian studied her . Studied her in the way a fighter sizes up his next opponent . She sounded so confident , but her body language told a different story . The little details he picked up on , like the way she kept licking at her lower lip , her left hand now clenching and unclenching at her side while her right held on to the leather strap of her purse as if it was a lifeline , told a story of their own . White knuckles . Rigid spine . In the base of her pale throat , her pulse fluttered with a telltale sign of nerves . Or was it fear ? Arousal ? <p> Whatever it was , Ian suddenly found himself captivated by the intimate sight of the pulsing vein beneath that smooth , flawless skin . It looked too delicate , too fragile , like something he could so easily sink his teeth into and mark . Taste . Something that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it scared the shit out of him . <p> " Even if what you 're saying is true , which I do n't believe for one second , what could my mother want with me ? " he asked in a low , rough blast of words that felt ripped out of his chest , all traces of sarcasm and humor gone . " We did n't talk for the last sixteen years of her life and she 's been gone for five months . Seems a little late to start mending fences now . " <p> " Elaina regrets that all those years were wasted , " she said with such an earnest expression , he honestly believed that she was buying her own bullshit . God , she really was a whack job . " Still , she contacted me because there are things she wants you to know . Important things she wishes she had explained while she still had the time . But first " She paused , and the look in those big brown eyes made him want to reach out to her and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done . He was saved from finding out when she cleared her throat , wet her bottom lip with a nervous flick of her tongue , then quietly said , " I 'm sorry to have to tell you that someone close to you is in danger . " <p> Aw , shit . What kind of sick game was this woman playing ? Whatever it was , his patience was at an end . <p> " In case you 've missed the clues , Miss Stratton , I 'm going to spell it out for you all nice and slow like . I do not think this kind of crap is funny . " Each word came from his lips with biting precision , his voice low , hard , expression even harder as he pulled off his glasses and glared at her through narrowed eyes . " Never have , even when my mother was parading her psycho friends in and out of our lives and putting my little brother and sister through an emotional wringer . I 'm warning you now , get back in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " <p> She crossed her arms over her chest , as if she could shield herself from the blast of his anger , but she did n't budge . " Trust me , Mr. Buchanan . Ian . I 'm not enjoying this any more than you are , but I made a promise to your mother and I 'm keeping it . I know she made mistakes , but she 's trying to set things right . And if you do n't listen to her  --  to me  --  to us then someone is going to end up hurt . I can feel it . " <p> Why in God 's name do I always have to go for the psychotic ones ? he silently cursed , running one hand through his hair so hard that his scalp stung . Must be in my goddamn genes . <p> That was one of the reasons he 'd kept things going with Kendra  --  the simple fact that she was so different from the women he usually hooked up with . The hard-nosed CPA did n't take to bullshit any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted from each other , even if their encounters left him with that gnawing edge in his gut . Left him cold inside . Left him wanting . <p> It sucked , sure  --  but he 'd learned to live with it . <p> " Like I said before , my mother died five months ago . Now get off my property . This is private land and you 're trespassing . " <p> He watched her mouth firm . Then those delicate , narrow shoulders pulled back , determination showing in every rigid line of her soft , womanly body . " No . " <p> Ian laid down his hammer and rose to his full height , expecting her to turn and hightail it away . At six-four , he was tall and broad , with enough muscles to make most people back down when he wanted them to . Wearing his meanest scowl , he held her stare , the look in his eyes purposefully hostile and fury-darkened . When he finally spoke , his words came in a low , silken rasp that he expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , no ? " <p> What did she mean ? She had no idea . <p> You are insane , Molly . Freaking certifiable . <p> How did you explain death and ghosts and pure , bone-chilling evil ? <p> How did you explain the existence of hell on earth or the fact that monsters really did hide in the shadows ? <p> That something was watching you over your shoulder ? <p> That we , humanity , were no longer alone ? <p> How did you explain to someone that their entire world was about to change , never to be the same again ? <p> Molly did n't know  --  did n't have the answers . She was only the bearer of bad news , not its source , and she thought of the old saying : Do n't shoot the messenger . <p> Somehow , she did n't think Ian Buchanan was going to be so understanding . Her mind felt dazed , and she knew why . It was pathetic , but the man 's physical presence had short-circuited her mental faculties . He wasshe faltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-edged male power and arrogance justice , but failed . Elaina had warned her that he 'd be distrustful , but she had n't mentioned how bitter he 'd become . <p> Or how gorgeous . Despite his crass rudeness , the man was a walking , talking poster boy for every woman 's hidden bad-boy fantasy . <br> Continues ...
