Warning : those of you who favor our lighter and sweeter stories will probably want to borrow someone else 's eyes to read this one . Laird Barron writes dark and often disturbing stories like " Old Virginia " that are apt to make you check the locks on the doors several times . This novella is one such saga , and an unrelenting one at that-a tough-guy tale about how the hired muscle got a lesson in art . Perhaps we should also issue a warning for them what likes tales from the dark side : you 'll want to check your schedule before starting this story , because once you get started , it 's not likely to let you go . <p> Imago . Imago . Imago. - Wallace Stevens 1 . LIKE THE SHROUD OF TURIN , the disfigured shape in the photograph was a face waiting to be born . An inhuman face , in this instance - the Devil , abstracted , or a black-mouthed sunflower arrested mid-bloom . Definitely an object to be regarded with morbid appreciation , and then followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jacob Wilson 's Christmas party to see his uncle 's last acquisition , one that old man Theodore had n't stuck around to enjoy . A natural Rorschach , Jacob said of the photo . It had been hanging in the Seattle Art Museum for months , pending release at the end of its show . Jacob was feeling enigmatic when he called about the invitation three days before Christmas and would say no more . No need - the hook was set . I had n't talked to Jacob since the funeral . I almost skipped his party despite that guilt , aware of the kind of people who would attend . Whip-thin socialites with quick , sharp tongues , iron-haired lawyers from colonial families , and sardonic literati dredged from resident theater groups . Sleek , wealthy , and voracious ; they inhabited spheres far removed from mine . As per custom , I would occupy the post of the educated savage in Jacob 's court . An orangutan dressed for a calendar shoot , propped in the corner to brood artfully . Perhaps I could entertain them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't appealing . Nonetheless , I went because I always went , and because Carol gave me her sweetest frown when I hesitated ; the one that hinted of typhoons and earthquakes . The ride from my loft in downtown Olympia served to prepare my game face . I took the 101 north , turned onto Delphi Road and followed it through the deep , dark Capitol Forest and up into the Black Hills . Carol chattered on her cell , ignoring me , so I drove too fast . I always drove too fast these days . The party was at full steam as I rolled along the mansion 's circle drive and angled my rusty , four-door Chrysler into a slot among the acres of Porsches , Jaguars , and Mercedes . Teddy Wilson might 've only been a couple of months in his grave , but Jacob was no neophyte host of galas . He attracted the cream , all right . Bing Crosby and a big band were hitting their stride when the front doors gave way . A teenage hood in a spiffy white suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wallet . The bluebloods congregated in a parlor dominated by a fiery synthetic tree . A slew of the doorman 's white-tuxedoed brethren circulated with trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres . The atmosphere was that of a cast party on the set of Casablanca . Jarring the illusion was Wayne Newton 's body double slumped on the bench of the baby grand , his pinky ring winking against the keys . I did n't think he was playing ; a haphazard pyramid of shot glasses teetered near his leg and he looked more or less dead . Guests milled , mixing gleeful ennui with bad martinis . Many were sufficiently drunk to sand down the veneer of civility and start getting nasty . Jacob presided , half seas over , as the Cockney used to say , lolling before his subjects and sycophants in Byzantine splendor . I thought , Good god , he 's wearing a cape ! His attire was a silken clash of maroon and mustard , complete with ruffles , a V-neck shirt ripped from the back of a Portuguese corsair , billowing pantaloons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and gold cape spread beneath his bulk , and he fanned himself with a tricorner hat . Fortunately , he was n't wearing the hat . Carol glided off to mingle , stranding me without a backward glance . I tried not to take it personally . If not for a misfortune of birth , this could have been her tribe . Meanwhile , I spotted the poster-sized photograph upon its easel , fixed in the center of the parlor . Heavy as a black hole , the photograph dragged me forward on wires . Shot on black and white , it detailed a slab of rock , which I assumed was subterranean . Lacking a broader frame of reference , it was impossible to know . The finer aspects of geology escaped me , but I was fascinated by the surreal quality of this glazed wall , its calcified ridges , webbed spirals and bubbles . The inkblot at its heart was humanoid , head twisted to regard the viewer . The ambient light had created a blur not unlike a halo , or horns , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an unequal ellipse . A horrible silhouette ; lumpy , misshapen , and dead for epochs . Hopefully dead . Other pockets of half-realized darkness orbited the formation , fragments splintered from the core . More cavemen , devils , or dragons . Hosts occurred to me . A chunky kid in a turtleneck said it actually resembled a monstrous jellyfish snared in flowstone , but was undoubtedly simple discoloration . Certainly not any figure - human or otherwise . He asked Jacob his opinion . Jacob squinted and declared he saw only the warp and woof of amber shaved bare and burned by a pop flash . Supposedly another guest had witnessed an image of Jesus on Golgotha . This might have been a joke ; Jacob had demolished the contents of his late uncle 's liquor cabinet and was acting surly . I seldom drank at Jacob 's cocktail socials , preferring to undertake such solemn duty in the privacy of my home . But I made a Christmas exception , and I paid . Tumblers began clicking in my head . A queasy jolt nearly loosened my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph and its spectral face in stone . The crowd shrank , shivered as dying leaves , became pictographs carved into a smoky cave wall . A dung fiie sputtered against the encroaching well of night , and farther along the cave wall , scored with its Paleolithic characters , a cleft sank into the humid earth . Flies buzzed , roaches scuttled . A reed pipe wheedled an almost familiar tune My gorge tasted alkaline ; my knees buckled . This moment of dislocation expanded and burst , revealing the parlor still full of low lamplight and cigarette smog , its mob of sullen revelers intact . Jacob sprawled on his leather sofa , regarding me . His expression instantly subsided into a mask of flabby diffidence . It happened so smoothly and I was so shaken I let it go . Carol did n't notice ; she was curled up by the fireplace laughing too loudly with a guy in a Norwegian sweater . The roses in their cheeks were brick-red and the sweater guy kept slopping liquor on the rug when he gestured . Jacob waved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got medicine in the study . " " " And you look like the Sun King . " He laughed . " Seriously , there 's some grass left . Or some in any way influenced his fashion sense . On the other hand , vicodin sounded too good to be true . " Thanks . My bones are giving me hell . " The dull ache in my spine had sharpened to a railroad spike as it always did during the rainy season . After we had retreated to the library and poured fresh drinks , I leaned against a bookcase to support my back . " What 's it called ? " He sloshed whiskey over yellow teeth . " Parallax Alpha . Part one of a trio entitled the Imago Sequence - if I could lay my hands on Parallax Beta and Imago , I 'd throw a real party . " His voice reverberated in the rich , slurred tones of a professional speaker who 'd shrugged off the worst body blows a bottle of malt scotch could offer . " There are two others ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm repulsed . " I had gathered my nerves into one jangling bundle ; sufficient to emote a semblance of calm . " Yet fascinated . " His left eyelid drooped in a wink . " Me too . I 'd kill to see the rest . Each is a sister of this piece - subtle perspective variances , different fields of depth , but quite approximate . " " Who 's got them - anybody I know ? " " Parallax Beta is on loan to a San Francisco gallery by the munificence of a collector named Anselm Thornton . A trust fund brat turned recluse . It 's presumed he has Imago . Nobody is sure about that one , though . We 'll get back to it in a minute . " " Jake - what do you see in that photo ? " " I 'm not sure . A tech acquaintance of mine at UW analyzed it . " Inconclusive , " she said . Something 's there . " " Spill the tale . " " Heard of Maurice Amrnon ? " I shook my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photographer attached to the Royal University of London back in the " 40s and " 50s . He served as chief shutterbug for pissant expeditions in the West Indies and Africa . Competent work , though not Sotheby material . The old boy was a craftsman . He did n't pretend to be an artist . " " Except for the Imago series . " " Bingo . Parallax Alpha , for example , transcends journeyman photography , which is why Uncle Teddy was so , dare I say , obsessed . " Jacob chortled , pressed the glass to his cheek . His giant , red-rimmed eye leered at me . " Cecil Eaton was the first to recognize what Ammon had accomplished . Eaton was a Texas oil baron and devoted chum of Ammon 's . Like a few others , he suspected the photos were of a hominid . He purchased the series in " 55 . Apparently , misfortune befell him and his estate was auctioned . Since then the series has changed hands several times and gotten scattered from Hades to breakfast . Teddy located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The owner got committed to Grable and the family was eager to sell . Teddy caught it on the hop . " " Define obsession for me . " I must 've sounded hurt , being kept in the dark about one of Teddy 's eccentric passions , of which he 'd possessed legion , because Jacob looked slightly abashed . " Sorry , Marvo . It was n't a big deal - I never thought it was important , anyway . But ... Teddy was on the hunt since 1987 . He blew maybe a quarter mill traveling around following rumors and whatnot . The pieces moved way too often . He said it was like trying to grab water . " " Anybody ever try to buy the whole enchilada ? " " The series has been fragmented since Ammon originally sold two to Eaton and kept the last for himself - incidentally , no one knows much about the final photograph , Imago . Ammon never showed it around and it did n't turn up in his effects . " " Where 'd they come from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos " origin a secret . He refused to say where he took them , or what they represented . " " Okay . Maybe he was pumping up interest by working the element of mystery . " I 'd watched enough artists in action to harbor my share of cynicism . Jacob let it go . " Our man Maurice was an odd duck . Consorted with shady folks , had peculiar habits . There 's no telling where his mind was . " " Peculiar habits ? Do tell . " " I do n't know the details . He was smitten with primitive culture , especially obscure primitive religions - and most especially the holy pharmaceuticals that accompany certain rites . " He feigned taking a deep drag from a nonexistent pipe . " Sounds like a funky dude . He lived happily ever after ? " " Alas , he died in a plane crash in " 57 . Well , his plane disappeared over Nairobi . Same difference . Bigwigs from the University examined his journals , but the journals did n't shed any light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dramatic effect . " Indeed , some of those scholars hinted that the journals were extremely cryptic . Gave them the willies , as the campfire tales go . I gather Ammon was doubtful of humanity 's long-term survival ; did n't believe we were equipped to adapt with technological and sociological changes looming on the horizon . He admired reptiles and insects - had a real fixation on them . " The series went into private-collector limbo before it was subjected to much scrutiny . Experts debunked the hominid notion . Ammon 's contemporaries suggested he was a misanthropic kook , that he created the illusion to perpetrate an intricate hoax . " Something in the way Jacob said this last part caused my ears to prick up . " The experts only satisfy four out of five customers , " I said . He studied his drink , smiled his dark smile . " Doubtless . However , several reputable anthropologists gave credence to its possible authenticity . They maintained official silence for fear of being ostracized by their peers , of being labeled crackpots . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value would soar . Their owner would be a celebrity , too , I suppose . " Finally , Jacob 's motives crystallized . " Good god , yes ! Imagine the scavenger hunt . Every swinging dick with a passport and a shovel would descend upon all the remote sites where Ammon ever set foot . And let me say , he got around . " I sat back , calculating the angles through a thickening alcoholic haze . " Are the anthropologists alive ; the guys who bought this theory ? " " I can beat that . Ammon kept an assistant , an American grad student . After Ammon died , the student faded into the woodwork . Guess who it turns out to be ? - The hermit art collector in California . Anselm Thornton ditched the graduate program , jumped the counterculture wave in Cali - drove his upper-crust , Dixie-loving family nuts , too . If anybody knows the truth about the series , I 'm betting it 's him . " " Thornton 's a southern gentleman . " " He 's of southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cattle rancher. " - " Longhorns ? " " Charbray . " " " Ooh , classy . " I crunched ice to distract myself from mounting tension in my back . " Think papa Thornton was thick with that Eaton guy ? An oil baron and a cattle baron - real live American royalty . The wildcatter , a pal to the mysterious British photographer ; the Duke , with a son as the photographer 's protg . Next we 'll discover they 're all Masons conspiring to hide the missing link . They are n't Masons , are they ? " " Money loves money . Maybe it 's relevant , maybe not . The relevant thing is Thornton Jr . may have information I desire . " I did n't need to ask where he had gathered this data . Chuck Shepherd was the Wilson clan 's pet investigator . He worked from an office in Seattle . Sober as a mortician , meticulous and smooth on the phone . I said , " Hermits are n't chatty folk . " " Enter Marvin Cortez , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with his whiskey breath and squeezed my shoulder . " Two things . I want the location of this hominid , if there is a hominid . There probably is n't , but you know what I mean . Then , figure out if Thornton is connected to ... the business with my uncle . " I raised my brows . " Does Shep think so ? " " I do n't know what Shep thinks . I do know Teddy contacted Thornton . They briefly corresponded . A few weeks later , Teddy 's gone . " " Damn , Jake , that 's a stretch - never mind . How 'd they make contact ? " Jacob shrugged . " Teddy mentioned it in passing . I was n't taking notes . " " Ever call Thornton yourself , do any follow-up ? " " We searched Teddy 's papers , pulled his phone records . No number for Thornton , no physical address , except for this card - the Weston Gallery , which is the one that has Parallax Beta . The director blew me off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , actually . I wrote Thornton a letter around Thanksgiving , sent it care of the gallery . He has n't replied . I wanted the police to shake a few answers out of the gallery , but they gave me the runaround. case closed , let 's get some doughnuts , boys ! " " Turn Shep loose . A pro like him will do this a lot faster . " " Faster ? I do n't give a damn about faster . I want answers . The kind of answers you get by asking questions with a lead pipe . That is n't up Shep 's alley . " I envisioned the investigator 's soft , pink hands . Banker 's hands . My own were broad and heavy , and hard as marble . Butcher 's hands . - Jacob said , " I 'll cover expenses . And that issue with King .... " " It 'll dry up and blow away ? " Rudolph King was a contractor on the West Side , - he moonlighted as a loan shark , ran a pool hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I occasionally collected for him . A job went sour ; he reneged on our arrangement , so I shut his fingers in a filing cabinet - a bit rough , but there were proprietary interests at stake . Jacob crossed certain palms with silver , saved me from making a return appearance at Walla Walla . Previously , I did nine months there on a vehicular assault charge for running over a wise-mouth pimp named Leon Berens . Berens had been muscling in on the wrong territory - a deputy sheriff 's , in fact , which was the main reason I only did a short hitch . The kicker was , after he recovered , Berens landed the head bartender gig at the Happy Tiger , a prestigious lounge in the basement of the Sheraton . He was ecstatic because the Happy Tiger was in a prime spot three blocks from the Capitol Dome . Hustling a string of five **33;2418;TOOLONG for the stuffed shirts was definitely a vertical career move . He fixed me up with dinner and drinks whenever I wandered in . " Poof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his glass and I pretended to consider his proposal . We knew there was no escape clause in our contract . I owed him and the marker was on the table . I said , " I 'll make some calls , see if I can track him down . You still want me to visit him ... well , we 'll talk again . All right ? " " Thanks , Marvin . " " Also , I want to look at Teddy 's papers myself . I 'll swing by in a day or two . " " No problem . " We ambled back to the party . A five-piece band from the Capitol Theatre was gearing up for a set . I went to locate more scotch . When I returned , Jacob was surrounded by a school of liberal arts piranhas , the lot of them swimming in a pool of smoke from clove cigarettes . I melted into the scenery and spent three hours nursing a bottle of mineral water , avoiding eye contact with anyone who looked ready for conversation . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No need to have worried on that score , by then , everyone else had lost complete interest . Around midnight Carol keeled over beside the artificial tree . The guy in the Norwegian sweater moved on to a blonde in a shiny dress . I packed Carol in the car and drove home , grateful to escape another Jacob Wilson Christmas party without rearranging somebody 's face . 2 . NOBODY KNEW if Theodore Wilson was dead , it was simply the safe way to bet . One knife-bright October morning the coastguard had received a truncated distress signal from his yacht , Pandora , north of the San Juans . He 'd been on a day trip to his lover 's island home . Divers combed the area for two weeks before calling it quits . They found no wreckage , no body . The odds of a man surviving more than forty minutes in that frigid water were minimal , however . Teddy never slowed down to raise a family , so Jacob inherited a thirteen-million-dollar estate for Christmas . It should 've been a nice present for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy since our time at State . College with Jacob had been movie-of-the-week material - the bluecollar superjock meets the royal wastrel . Me on a full wrestling scholarship and Jacob starring as the fat rich boy who had discovered superior financial status did not always garner what he craved most - adulation . Thick as ticks , we shared a dorm , went on road trips to Vegas , spent holidays at the Wilson House . Eventually he convinced his globetrotting uncle to support my Olympic bid . It was a hard sell - the elder Wilson had no use for contemporary athletic competition . Descended from nineteenth-century New England gentry , he favored the refined pursuits of amateur archeology , ancient philology , and sailing - but young Jacob was glib and the deal was made . Never mind that I was a second-rate talent blown up on steroids and hype , or that two of my collegiate titles were fixed by thick-jowled Irishmen who drank boilermakers for breakfast and insisted wrestling was a pansy sport . Teddy dropped me more than ten years ago . He lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peers when I tanked in " 9O before the Olympic Trials . The Ukrainian super heavyweight champion broke my back in two places during an exhibition match . Sounded like an elephant stepping on a stick of wet kindling . Bye , bye , macho , patriotic career . Hello physician-prescribed dope , self-prescribed booze , and a lifetime of migraines that would poleax a mule . Really , it was a goddamned relief . I got familiar with body casts , neck braces , and pity . Lately , the bitter dregs of a savings account kept a roof over my head and steak in my belly . A piecemeal contract to unload trucks for a couple Thurston County museums satisfied a minor art fetish . Mama had majored in sculpture , got me hooked as a lad . Collecting debts for the local " moneylenders " was mainly a hobby - just like dear old Pop before somebody capped him at a dogfight . I was a real Renaissance man . I met Carol while I was politely leaning on her then-boyfriend , a BMW salesman with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol worked as a data specialist for the department of corrections . She found the whole failed-athlete turned arm-breaker routine erotic . What should 've been a weekend fling developed into a bad habit that I had n't decided the best way to quit . The day after the party I asked her what she thought of Jacob 's photograph . She was stepping out of the shower , dripping hair wrapped in a towel . " What photograph ? " she asked . , I stared at her . She did n't smile , too busy searching for her earrings . Probably as hung-over as I was . " Oh , that piece of crap his uncle bought off that crazy bitch in Seattle . I did n't like it . Piece of crap . Where are my goddamned earrings . " " Did you even look at it ? " " Sure . " " Notice anything unusual ? " " It was unusually crappy . Here we go . " She retrieved her earrings from the carpet near her discarded stockings . " Why , he try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't buy the ugly thing . It 's crap . " " Not likely . Jacob wants me to do a little research . " Carol applied her lipstick with expert slashes , eyed me in her vanity while she worked . " Research , huh ? " " Research , baby , " I said . " Do n't do anything too stupid . " She shrugged on her coat , grabbed an umbrella . It was pouring out there . " Yeah , " I said . " Yeah , right . And do n't buy that crappy photo . " She pecked my cheek , left me sneezing in a cloud of perfume and hairspray . New Year 's Eve sneaked up on me . I stopped dragging my feet and made calls to friends of friends in the Bay area , hoping to get a line on the enigmatic Mr. Thornton . No dice . However , the name triggered interesting matches on the Internet . According to his former associates , a couple of whom were wards of the federal penal system , Thornton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free wine , and free thinking . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Shep 's intelligence was more thorough . After quitting grad school Thornton organized a commune in San Francisco in the " 60s , penned psychedelic tracts about the nature of faith and divine cosmology , appeared on local talk radio and did cameos in film documentaries . He 'd also gotten himself charged with kidnapping and contributing to the delinquency of minors . Disgruntled parents accused him of operating a cult and brainwashing runaway teens . Nothing stuck . His house burned down in " 74 and the commune disbanded , or migrated ; reports were fuzzy . Thornton resurfaced in 1981 to purchase Parallax Beta at an estate sale in Manitoba . Its owner , a furrier named Robespierre , had come to an unfortunate fate - - Robespierre got raving drunk at a party , roared off in his brand-new Italian sports car and plunged into a ravine . Authorities located the smashed guardrail , but no further trace of the car or its drunken occupant . Thornton 's relatives were either dead or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the lady suffered from Alzheimer 's , thus tracking him through family was a no-go . Shep confirmed getting stonewalled by the Weston Gallery . Ah , a dead end ; my work here was done . Except , it was n't . It began as the traditional New Year 's routine . I drank and contemplated my navel about a wasted youth . I drank and contemplated the gutted carcass of my prospects . I drank and contemplated what Parallax Alpha was doing to my peace of mind . Initially , I wrote it off as interest due on multiple fractures and damaged nerves . My lower back went into spasms ; pain banged its Viking drum . I chased a bunch of pills with a bunch more eighty-proof and hallucinated . With sleep came ferocious nightmares that left welts under my eyes . Dinosaurs trumpeting , roaches clattering across the hulks of crumbling skyscrapers . Dead stars in a dead sky . Skull-yellow planets caught in amber - a vast , twinkling necklace of dried knuckles . The beast in the photograph opening its mouth to batten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ones like it , with increasing frequency . I was n't superstitious . Okay , the series had a bizarre history that got stranger the deeper I dug ; bad things dogged its owners - early graves , retirement to asylums , disappearances . And yeah , the one picture I had viewed gave me a creepy vibe . But I was n't buying into any sort of paranormal explanation . I did n't believe in curses . I believed in alcoholism , drug addiction , and paranoid delusion . Put them in a shaker and you were bound to lose your marbles now and again . Then one evening , while sifting Teddy 's personal effects - going through the motions to get Jacob off my back - I found a dented ammo box . The box was stuffed with three decades " worth of photographs , although the majority were wartime shots . Whenever he had a few drinks under his belt , Jacob was pleased to expound upon the grittier side of his favorite uncle . Jolly Saint Teddy had not always been a simple playboy multimillionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligence officer , spooks , the boys called them . Predictable as taxes , really - he 'd recently graduated from Dartmouth and there was a war on . A police action , if you wanted to get picky , but everybody knew what it was . The snapshots were mainly of field hijinks with the troops and a few of Saigon R &R; exploits . From what I could discern , when they were in the rear areas , all the intelligence guys dressed like Hollywood celebrities auditioning for a game show - tinted shooting glasses , Hawaiian shirts , frosty Coke bottles with teeny umbrellas at hand , a girl on each arm ; the whole bit . Amusing , in a morbid sense . One of the field shots caught my attention and held it . It was not amusing in any sense . The faded caption read , Mekong D. 1967 . A platoon of marines decked out in full combat gear , mouths grinning in olive-black faces . Behind them were two men dressed in civilian clothes . I had no problem recognizing Anselm Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class albums from Texas A &.M,; and a jittery videotaped chronicle of the beatniks . Thornton 's image was fuzzy - a pith helmet obscured his eyes , and a bulky , complicated camera was slung over one shoulder ; sweat stains made half-moons under his armpits . Had he been with the press corps ? No , the records did n't lie . During Nam , Thornton had been dropping LSD and poaching chicks outside of Candlestick Park . Teddy , the old , exquisitely corpulent Teddy I knew , stood near him , incomprehensibly juxtaposed with these child-warriors . He wore a doublebreasted suit a South American tailor had made recently . The suit restrained a once powerful frame sliding to blubber . Below a prominent brow , his face shone a mottled ivory ; his eyes were sockets . His mouth gaped happily , smoldering with dust and cobwebs . A structure loomed beyond the marines . Screened by foliage , a battered marquee took shape . The marquee spelled AL D IN . The building was canted at an alarming angle ; greasy smoke mushroomed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Teddy 's residence of choice when he visited Vegas . It was in a back room of that sacred hotel he once shook hands with his hero , the inestimable Dean Martin - who , in his opinion , was the better half of the Lewis &; Martin act - during a high-stakes poker game reserved for the crme de la crme of big-shot gamblers . Teddy did n't qualify as a whale , as they referred to those suckers who routinely lost half a mil in one night , but he dropped his share of iron at the tables , and he always did have a knack for being at the heart of the action . I squinted at that photo until my eyes crossed-it was the Aladdin , no question . Yet an Aladdin even Teddy might not have recognized . Gray smudges in the windows were faces gazing down upon the razed jungle . Many of them were laughing or screaming . I could n't figure out what the hell I was seeing . I pawed through the box by the light of a Tiffany lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More of the same ; nearly three hundred pictures , all out of kilter , many in ways I never did quite understand . The latest seemed to contain medical imagery - some kind of surgery in progress . Overexposed , they formed a ruddy patina that was maddeningly obscure : Teddy 's face streaked with blood as someone stitched his scalp in near darkness ; coils of achromatic motion and pale hands with thick , dirty nails ; a closeup of a wound , or a flower 's corona ; white , pink and black . It was impossible to identify the action . I stopped looking after that , hedged around the issue with Jacob , asked him in an oblique way if his uncle might 've known Thornton , during the halcyon days . Jacob was skeptical ; he was certain such a fact would 've come to light during Teddy 's quest for the Imago Sequence . I did n't tell him about the ammo box ; at that point it seemed wiser to keep my mouth shut . Either I was losing my sanity , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob 's inherited art piece was woven much tighter than I had suspected .

Her family had placed her in Grable , the best that money , a heap of money , could buy . Intimates referred to it as the Grable hotel or Club Grable . These days , her presence there was an open secret thanks to the insatiable press . No matter ; the hospital had a closed-doors policy and an iron fist in dealing with staff members who might choose to blab . Any news was old news . Mrs. Chin was heiress to the estate of a naturalized Chinese businessman who 'd made his fortune breeding rhesus monkeys for medical research . His associates called him the Monkey King . After her elderly husband passed on , Mrs. Chin resumed her debutante ways , club-hopping from Seattle to the French Riviera , screwing bullfighters , boxers , and a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more abstract , the more exquisitely provincial , the better .

What I did n't know was if she would talk to me . Jacob made nice with her father , got me a direct line to her at the institution . She preferred to meet in person , but gave no indication she was particularly interested in discussing Parallax Alpha . She did n't sound too whacko on the phone , thank god . Grable loomed at the terminus of a long gravel lane . Massive and Victorian , the institution had been freshly updated in tones of green and brown . The grounds were hemmed by a fieldstone wall and a spiral maze of orchards , parks , and vacant farmland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit ; everything was dead and moldering .

I might 've looked like a schlep ; nonetheless , far safer to kiss each and every ass that walked through the door . An androgynous receptionist processed my information , loaned me a visitor 's tag and an escort named Hugo . Hugo deposited me in a cozy antechamber decorated with matching wicker chairs , an antique vase , prints of Mount Rainier and Puget Sound , and a worn Persian rug . The prints were remarkably cheap and crappy , in my humble opinion . Although I was far from an art critic . I favored statues over paintings any day . I twiddled my thumbs and pondered how the miracle of electroshock therapy had been replaced by cable television and self-help manuals . The wicker chair put a crick in my neck , so I paced . Mrs. Chin sauntered in , dressed in a superfluous baby-blue sports bra with matching headband and chromatic spandex pants . Her face gleamed , stiff as a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescent mummy without the wrapper . I read in Us that she turned forty-five in the spring ; her orange skin was speckled with plum-dark liver spots that formed clusters and constellations . She tested the air with predatory tongue-flicks . " Mr. Cortez , you are the most magnificently ugly man I have seen since Papa had our gardener deported to Argentina . Let me tell you what a shame that was . " " Hey , the light is n't doing you any favors either , lady , " I said . She went into her suite , left the door ajar . " Tea ? " She rummaged through kitchen drawers . A faucet gurgled and then a microwave hummed . " No thanks . " I glanced around . It was similar to the antechamber , except more furniture and artwork - she liked O'Keeffe and Bosch . There were numerous oil paintings I did n't recognize ; anonymous nature photographs , a Mayan calendar , and a smattering of southwestern pottery . She had a nice view of the grounds . Joggers trundled cobble paths ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place definitely appeared more an English country club than a hospital . " Great digs , Mrs. Chin . I 'm surprised they let you committed types handle sharp objects . " I stood near a mahogany rolltop and played with a curved ceremonial knife that doubled as a paperweight . " I 'm rich . I do whatever I want . " She returned with cups and a Tupperware dish of steaming water . " This is n't a prison , you know . Sit . " I sat across from her at a small table with a centerpiece of wilted geraniums and a fruit bowl containing a single overripe pear . A fat bluebottle fly crept about the weeping flesh of the pear . Mrs. Chin crumbled green tea into china cups , added hot water , then honey from a stick with an expert motion , and leaned back without touching hers . " Hemorrhoids , Mr. Cortez ? " " Excuse me ? " " You look uncomfortable . " " Uh , back trouble . Aches and pains galore from a misspent youth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a taste every day . " " Nummy . I 'll pass . New Age health regimens do n't grab me . " " Sharks grow new teeth , " Mrs. Chin said . " Replacements . Teeth are a problem for humans - dentistry helps , but if an otherwise healthy man has them all removed , say because of thin enamel , he loses a decade , perhaps more . The jaw shortens , the mouth cavity shrinks , the brain is fooled . A general shutdown begins to occur . How much happier our lives would be , with the shark 's simple restorative capability . " This spooled from her tongue like an infomercial clip . " Wow . " I gave her an indulgent smile , took a cautious sip of tea . " You did n't slip any in here , did you ? " " No , my stash is far too expensive to waste on the likes of you , Mr. Cortez . Delightful name - are you a ruthless , modern-day conqueror ? Did you come to ravish my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonofabitch , if that counts for anything . I do n't even speak Spanish . English will get you by in most places , and that 's good enough for me . What secrets ? " " I 'm a sex addict . " " Now that 's not exactly a secret , is it ? " It was n't . Her exploits were legendary among the worldwide underground , as I had learned . She was fortunate to be alive . " How do they treat that , anyway ? " " Pills , buckets of pills . Diversion therapy . They replace negative things with positive things . They watch me - there are cameras everywhere in this building . Does the treatment work ? " Here she winked theatrically . " I am permitted to exercise whenever I please . I love to exercise - endorphins keep me going . " " Sad stuff . Tell me about Parallax Alpha . " I produced a notebook , uncapped a pen . " Are you so confident that I will ? " she said , amused . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider it free counseling . " " Pretty . Very pretty . Papa had to sell a few of my things , balance the books . Did you acquire the photograph ? " " A friend of mine . He wants me to find out more about it . " " You should tell your friend to go to hell . " " Really . " " Really . " She picked up the pear , brushed the fly off , took a large bite . Juice glistened in her teeth , dripped from her chin . She dabbed it with a napkin . Very ladylike . " You do n't have money , Mr. Cortez . " " I 'm a pauper , it is true . " " Your friend has many uses for a man like you , I 'm sure . Well , the history of the Imago Sequence is chock full of awful things befalling rich people . Does that interest you ? " " I 'm not overly fond of the upper class . This is a favor . " . " A big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accent the point . The lump traveled slowly down her throat - a pig disappearing into an anaconda . " I purchased Parallax Alpha on a lark at a seedy auction house in Mexico City . That was years ago ; my husband was on his last legs emphysema . The cigarette companies are making a killing in China . I was bored ; a worldly stranger invited me to tour the galleries , take in a party . I did n't speak Spanish either , but my date knew the brokers , landed me a fair deal . The joke was on me , of course . My escort was a man named Anselm Thornton . Later , I learned of his connection to the series . You are aware that he owns the other two in the collection ? " " I am . " " They 're bait . That 's why he loans them to galleries , encourages people with lots of friends to buy them and put them on display . " " Bait ? " " Yes , bait . The photographs radiate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always hunting for the sweetmeats . " She chuckled ruefully . " I was sweet , but not quite sweet enough to end up in the fold . Alpha was mine , though . Not much later , I viewed Beta . By then the reaction , whatever it was , had started inside me , was consuming me , altering me in ways I could scarcely dream . I craved more . God , how I begged to see Imago ! Anselm laughed - laughed , Mr. Cortez . He laughed and said that it was too early in the game for me to reintegrate . He also told me there 's no Imago . No Imago , no El Dorado , no Santa Claus . " Her eyes were hard and yellow . " The bastard was lying , though . Imago exists , perhaps not as a photograph . But it exists . " " Reintegrate with what , Mrs. Chin ? " " He would n't elaborate . He said , " We are born , we absorb , we are absorbed . Therein lies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantra of his . Anselm held that thought does n't originate in the mind . Our brains are rather like meaty receivers . Is n't that a wild concept ? Humans as nothing more than complicated sensors , or mayhap walking sponges . Such is the path to ultimate , libertine anarchy . And one might as well live it up , because there is no escape from the cycle , no circumvention of the ultimate , messy conclusion ; in fact , it 's already happened a trillion times over . The glacier is coming and no power will hold it in abeyance . " I did n't bother writing any of that down ; I was plenty spooked before she came across with that booby-hatch monologue . I said , " It sounds like extremely convenient rationale for psychopathic behavior . He dumped you after your romp ? " " Frankly , I 'm a lucky girl . Anselm deemed me more useful at large , spreading his influence . I brought Parallax Alpha stateside - that was the bargain , my part in the grand drama . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . The resort threw a ball , a singles event , and Roy Fulcher made the introductions . Fulcher was a radical , a former chemist - Caltech , I believe . Struck me as a naturalist gone feral . A little bird informed me the CIA had him under surveillance - he seemed primed to blow something up , maybe spike a city reservoir . At the outset I suspected Fulcher was approaching me about funding for some leftist cause . People warned me about him . Not that I needed their advice . I had oodles of card-carrying revolutionaries buzzing in my hair at the time . Soon , I absolutely abhorred the notion of traveling in Latin America . Fuck the guerillas , fuck the republic , I just want a margarita . Fulcher was n't after cash , though . He was Anselm 's closest friend . A disciple . " " Disciple , gotcha . " I scribbled it in my trusty notebook . " What 's Thornton call his philosophy ? Cultist Christianity ? Rogue Buddhism ? Crystal worship ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tossed the remains of her fruit in a waste basket shaped like an elephant foot . " Anselm 's into pleasure . I think it fair to designate him the reigning king of sybarites . I was moderately wicked when I met him . He finished me off . Go mucking about his business and he 'll do for you too . " " Right . He 's Satan , then . How did he ruin you , Mrs. Chin ? Did he hook you on drugs , sex , or both ? " Her smile withered . " Satan may not exist , but Anselm surely does . Drugs were never the issue . I could always take them or leave them , and it 's more profound than sex . I speak of a different thing entirely . There exists a quality of corruption you would not be familiar with - not on the level or to the degree that I have seen , have lived . " She stopped , studied me . Her yellow eyes brightened . " Or , I 'm mistaken . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's the first sign . It 's a special person who does ; the kind Anselm drools over . " " No , Mrs. Chin . I think it sucks . " " It frightened you . Poor baby . And why not ? There are things to be frightened of in that picture . Enlightenment is n't necessarily a clean process . Enlightenment can be filthy , degenerate , dangerous . Enlightenment is its own reward , its own punishment . You begin to see so much more . And so much more sees you . " I said , " I take it this was in the late eighties , when you met Thornton ? Rumor has it he 's a hermit . Not much of a high-society player . Yet you say he was in Mexico , doing the playboy shtick . " . . " Even trapdoor spiders emerge from their lairs . Anselm travels in circles that will not publicize his movements . " " How would I go about contacting him ? Maybe get things from the horse 's mouth . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him ... find him . Be certain you wish to find him , Mr. Cortez . " " Okay . What about Fulcher ? Do you know where he is ? " " Oh , ick . Creepy fellow . I pretended he did n't exist , I 'm afraid . " " Thanks for your time , Mrs. Chin . And the tea . " I started to rise . " No more questions ? " " I 'm fresh out , Mrs. Chin . " " Wait , if you please . There 's a final item I 'd like to show you . " She went away and returned with a slim photo album . She pushed it across the table and watched me with a lizard smile to match her lizard eyes . " Can I trust you , Mr. Cortez ? " I shrugged . She spoke softly . " The staff censors my mail , examines my belongings . There are periodic inspections . Backsliding will not be tolerated . They do n't know about these . These are of my vacation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from the rafters of the cathedral . Go on , open it . " I did . There were n't many photos and I had to study them closely because each was a section of a larger whole . The cathedral must 've been huge ; an ancient vault lit by torches and lanterns . Obviously Fulcher had taken pains to get the sequence right - Mrs. Chin instructed me to remove eight of them from the protective plastic , place them in order on the table . An image took root and unfolded . A strange carpet , stained rose and peach , spread across shadowy counterchange tiles , snaked around immense gothic pillars and statuary . The carpet gleamed and blurred in patches , as if it were a living thing . " That 's me right about there , " Mrs. Chin tapped the third photo from the top . " Thrilling , to enact the writhing of the Ouroboros ! " " Jesus Christ , " I muttered . At least a thousand people coupled upon the cathedral floor . A great , quaking mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did you show me this ? " I looked away from the pictures and caught her smile , cruel as barbed wire . There was my answer . The institution was powerless to eradicate all of her pleasures . " Good-bye , Mr. Cortez . Good-bye , now . " Leaving , I noticed another overripe pear in the fruit bowl , as if Mrs. Chin had replaced it by sleight of hand . A fly sat atop , rubbing its legs together , wearing my image in its prism eyes . I was n't feeling well . I awoke at 2 A.M. , slick and trembling , from yet another nightmare . My head roared with blood . I rose , trying to avoid disturbing Carol , who slept with her arm shielding her eyes , my dog-eared copy of The Prince clutched in her fingers . I staggered into the kitchen for a handful of aspirin and a glass of cold milk . There was a beer left over from dinner , so I drank that too . It was while standing there , washed in the unearthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgy in Mrs. Chin 's photographs had been orchestrated to achieve a specific configuration . The monumental daisy chain made a nearly perfect double helix. 4 . IN THE MIDDLE of January I decided to cruise down to San Francisco and spend a weekend beating the bushes . I met Jacob for early dinner on the waterfront at an upscale grill called The Marlin . Back in the day , Teddy treated us there when he was being especially avuncular , although he had preferred to hang around the yacht club or fly to Seattle , where his cronies played . Jacob handed me the Weston Gallery 's business card and a roll of cash for expenses . We did n't discuss figures for Thornton 's successful interrogation . The envelope would be fat and the goodwill of a wealthy , bored man would continue to flow freely . Nor did he question my sudden eagerness to locate the hermit art collector . Still , he must have noticed the damage to my appearance that suggested worse than a simple New Year 's bender . Following dinner , I drove out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cigars with Earl Hutchinson , a buddy of mine since high school . He 'd been a small , tough kid from Iowa ; a so-called bad seed . He looked the part : slicked hair , switchblade in his sock , a cigarette behind his ear , a way of standing that suggested trouble . Hutch had n't changed , only drank a little more and got harder around the eyes . We relaxed on the porch ; it was a decent night with icy stars sprinkled among the gaps . Hutch was an entrepreneur ; while I was away in college he hooked up in the arms trade - he 'd served as an artillery specialist in the Army , forged connections within the underbelly of America 's war machine . He amassed an impressive stockpile before the anti-assault weapon laws put the kibosh on legal sales ; there were dozens of AK-47s , M16s , and Uzis buried in the pasture behind his house . I 'd helped him dig . These days it was guard dogs . He trained shepherds for security , did a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty except for a brood bitch named Gerta and some pups . Hutch said demand was brisk , what with the rise of terrorism and the sagging economy . Burglaries always spiked during recessions . Eventually the conversation swung around to my California trip . He walked into the house , came out with a .357 and a box of shells . I peeled four hundred bucks from my brand new roll , watched him press the bills into his shirt pocket . Hutch poured more tequila and we finished our cigars , reminiscing about happy times . lied about shit , mainly . I went home and packed a suitcase from college , bringing the essentials - winter clothes , pain pills , toiletries . I watered the plants and left a terse message on Carol 's answering service . She 'd flown to Spokane to visit her mother . She generally found a good reason to bug out for the high country when I got piss-drunk and prowled the apartment like a bear with a toothache . I told her I 'd be gone for a few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is , I volunteered for the California job to see the rest of the Imago Sequence . As if viewing the first had not done ample harm . In addition to solving Teddy 's vanishing act , I meant to ask Thornton some questions of my own . I attempted to drive through the night . Tough sledding - my back knotted from hunching behind the wheel . A dose of vicodin had no effect . I needed sleep . Unfortunately , the prospect of dreaming scared the hell out of me . I drove as long as my nerve held . Not fast , but methodically as a nail sinking into heartwood , . popping Yellowjackets and blasting the radio . In the end the pain beat me down . I took a short detour on a dirt road and rented a motel room south of Redding . I tried to catch a couple hours of rest . It was a terrible idea . Parallax Alpha ate its way into my dreams again . The motel ceiling jiggled , tapioca pudding with stars revolving in its depths . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened my mouth , but my mouth was already a rictus . The ceiling swallowed me , bones and all . - I squatted in a cavernous vault , chilled despite the rank , humid darkness pressing my flesh . Stench burrowed into my nose and throat . Maggots , green meat , rotten bone . Thick , sloppy noises , as wet rope smacking rock drew closer . A cow gave birth , an eruption . The calf mewled - blind , terrified . Old , old water dripped . An army of roaches began tomarch ; a battalion of worms plowed into a mountain of offal ; the frenetic drone of flies in glass , an embryonic bulk uncoiling in its cyst I awakened , muscles twitching in metronome to the shuttering numbers of the radio clock . Since Christmas , my longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep was three hours and change . I almost relished the notion of a grapeshot tumor gestating in my brain as the source of all that was evil . It did n't wash ; too easy . So said my puckered balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropologists , ordained priests , or who-the-hell-ever could debate the authenticity of Ammon 's handiwork until the cows came home . My clenched guts and arrhythmic heart harbored no doubt that he had snapped a photo of someone or something truly unpleasant . Worse , I could n't shake the feeling that Mrs. Chin was correct : it had looked right back at me . It was looking for me now . I got on the road ; left a red fantail of dust hanging . Midmorning crawled over the Frisco skyline , gin blossom clouds piling upon the bay . I drove to the address on the card , a homely warehouse across from a Mexican restaurant and a mortgage office that had been victimized by graffiti artists , and parked in the alley . Inside the warehouse were glass walls and blue shadows broken by giant ferns . I lifted a brochure from a kiosk in the foyer , a slick , multicolored pamphlet with headshots of the director and his chief cronies . I slipped it into my blazer pocket and forged ahead . The lady behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled back so tightly it forced her to smile when she shook my hand . I asked for Director Stanley Renfro and was informed that Mr. Renfro was on vacation . Could I please speak to the acting director ? She motioned me beyond shadowbox panels to the rear of the gallery where a crew of Hispanic and Vietnamese day laborers sweated to dismantle an installation of a scale city park complete with fiberglass fruit trees , benches , and a working gothic fountain . I picked my way across the mess of tarps , coax , and sawdust . Motes hung in the too-bright wash of stage lights . A Teutonic symphony shrilled counterpoint to arc welders . Acting director Clarke was a lanky man with a spade-shaped face . A serious whitebread bastard with no interest in fielding questions about Thornton or his photograph . Clarke was sated with the power rush of his new executive position ; I sensed I would n't be able to slip him a few bills to grease the rails and I 'd already decided to save breaking his head as a last resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the genius of Maurice Ammon . Clarke gave my haggard , sloppy self the once-over . " Ammon was a hack . " His eyes slightly crossed and he talked like a man punching typewriter keys . " Topless native women suckling their babies ; bonethrough-the-nose savages leaning on spears . Tourist swill . His specialty . " " Yeah ? Do n't tell me the Weston Gallery is in the business of showcasing hacks ? " " We feature only the highest caliber work . " Clarke paused to drone pidgin Spanish at one of the laborers . When he looked up at me again his sneer hardened . " 1 dislike the Imago Sequence . But one can not deny its ... resonance . Ammon got lucky . Does n't overcome a portfolio of mediocrity . " No , he did n't like the series at all . I read that plainly from the brief bulge of his eyes similar to a horse getting a whiff of smoke for the first time . The reaction seemed reasonable . " A three-hit wonder . " I tried to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop , Mr. Cortez ? " " What , I look like a cop to you ? " " Most citizens do n't have so many busted knuckles . A private eye , then . " " I 'm a tourist . Do you think Ammon actually photographed a fossilized caveman ? " " That 's absurd . The so-called figures are geological formations . Ask the experts . " " Wish I had nothing else to do with my life . You do n't buy it , eh ? " " The hominid theory is titillation . " He smirked . " It does sell tickets . " " He got bored with native titties and went for abstract art ? Sure looks like a troglodyte to me . " " Well , pardon my saying you do n't know squat about photography and I think you 're here on bad business . Did the toad send you ? " I chuckled . " You 've met Teddy . " " Never had the pleasure . I saw him in September , sniffing around the photo , practically wetting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll tell you exactly what Renfro told him : Parallax Beta is not for sale and its owner is not interested in discussing the matter . " " Renfro said that to Teddy , did he ? seems I 'm chasing my tail then . " He had said what I hoped to hear . " By the way , where did Mr. Renfro go for his vacation ? Somewhere warm , I hope . " Clarke 's sneer broadened . " He 's on sabbatical . " From the pleasure in his tone he did not expect his former patron to return . " Well , thanks for your time . " " Adios , Mr. Cortez . Since you came for a peek at Parallax Beta , stop by the Natural History display . " " Blessings to you and your children , Herr Director . " I went where he pointed , trying to act casual . The prospect of viewing the second photograph filled me with elation and dread . There it was , hanging between the Grand Tetons and the caldera of slumbering Mt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Alpha , magnified tenfold . The amber background had acquired a coarser quality ; its attendant clots and scars were more distinct , yet more distinctly ambiguous . They congealed to form asteroid belts , bell-shaped celestial gases , volcanic moons . The hominid 's howling mouth encompassed the majority of the picture . It seemed capable of biting off my head , of blasting my eardrums with its guttural scream . My vision tunneled and I tore myself away with the convulsive reflex of a man awakened from a dream of falling . Panpipes , clashing cymbals , strobes of meteoric rain . Dogs snarling , a bleating goat . Buzzing flies , worms snuggling in musty soil . All faded as I lurched away , routed from the field . I made it to the lobby and drank from the water fountain , splashing my face until the floor stopped tilting . The lady in the jumpsuit perched behind her desk , vulture-talons poised near the phone . She extended another wintry smile as I retreated from the building into the hard white glare . Eleven A.M. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on schedule . I was an amateur kneecap man , not a P.I . My local connections were limited to a bookie , a sports agent who might or might not be under indictment for money laundering , and the owner of a modest chain of gymnasiums . I adjourned to a biker grill called the Hog and downed several weak Bloody Marys with a basket of deep-fried oysters . The lunch crowd consisted of two leathery old-timers sipping draft beer , their Harley Davidson knockoffs parked on the curb , - a brutish man in a wife-beater T-shirt at the bar doing his taxes on a short form , and the bartender who had so much pomade in his hair it gleamed like a steel helmet . The geriatric bikers were sniping over the big N.F.C. championship game coming up between the Niners and the Cowboys . Between drinks , I borrowed the bartender 's ratty phonebook . Half the pages were ripped out , but I found a listing for S. Renfro , which improved my mood for about three seconds . I tried ringing him from the pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message declared that the number was not in service , please try again . Following Hog tradition , I tore out the page and saved it for later . I called Jacob collect . After he accepted charges , I said , " Were you around Teddy before he disappeared ? " " Eh ? We 've been over this . " " Be nice , I 'm slow . " Several static-laden beats passed . Then , " Um , not so much . Teddy 's always been secretive , though . " " Okay , was he more or less secretive those last few weeks ? " He coughed in a phlegmy way that suggested I had prodded him from the slumber of the indolent rich . " I do n't know , Marv . I got used to him sneaking around . What 's going on ? " " I have n't figured that out yet . Did his habits change ? And I mean even an iota . " " No - wait . He dressed oddly . Yeah . Well , more than usual , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . " " Give me a sec .... " Jacob cursed , knocked something off a shelf , cursed again . A metallic snick was followed by a scratchy drag into the receiver . " He wore winter clothes a lot at the end . Inside , too , the few times I saw him . You know - sock cap , mackinaw , and boots . He looked like a Canadian longshoreman . Said he was cold . But , what 's that ? Teddy dressed for safari half the time . He was eccentric . " " Thin blood . Too many years in the tropics , " I said . " You have anything yet ? " " Nope . I 'm just trying to cover all the bases . " I wondered if dear , departed Theodore had suffered night sweats , if he had ever lain in bed staring at a maw of darkness that grinned toothless as a sphincter . I wondered if Jacob did . Jacob said , " You do n't think he was mixing with a rough element , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into the drink . Stuff like this happens to seniors . They find them wandering around race tracks or shopping malls . Happens every day . " " Keep digging anyway . " " " I 'll hit you back when I find more . Bye , bye . " I broke the connection , rubbed sweat from my cheek . I needed a shave . The last call was to my bookie friend . I took the Cowboys and the points because I hoped to counter the growing sense of inevitability hanging over my head like Damocles 's least favorite pig sticker . Come Sunday night I owed the bookie five hundred bucks . 5 . STANLEY RENFRO 'S house drank the late afternoon glow . Far from imposing , as I had half expected , simply one of many brick and timber colonials bunkered in the surrounding hills . It was painted in conservative tones and set back from the street , windows blank . A blue sedan was parked in the drive , splattered with enough seagull shit to make me suspect it had n't moved lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn . The grass was shin-high and climbing . I did not want to walk up the block and enter that house . My belly churned with indigestion . A scream had recently interrupted my fitful doze . This scream devolved into the dwindling complaints of a bus horn . Minutes later when the sodium lamps caught fire and Renfro 's house remained black , I decided he was dead . This leap of intuition could not be proved by yellow papers or flourishing weeds . Nah. the illustrious director might be taking a nap . No need to turn the lights on . Maybe he 's not even inside . Maybe he 's in Borneo stealing objets d'art from the natives . He left his car because a crony gave him a lift to the airport . He forgot to cancel the newspaper . Somebody else forgot to cut the grass . Sure . The house reminded me of a corpse that had n't quite begun to fester . I retrieved a flashlight from the glove compartment . Thick , and made of steel , like cops use . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysler , leaned against the frame until my neck loosened and I could rotate my head without catching a fireworks show . No one appeared to notice when I hiked through Renfro 's yard , although a small dog barked nearby . The alarm system was cake - since it was predicated on pressure , all I needed to do was smash a kitchen window and climb through without disturbing the frame . This turned out to be unnecessary . The power was down and the alarm 's emergency battery had died . The kitchen smelled foul despite its antiseptic appearance . Street light spread my shadow into monstrous proportions . Water drooled around the base of the refrigerator . Distant traffic vibrated china in its cabinet . Everything reeked of mildew and decaying fruit . I clicked on the flashlight as I proceeded deeper into the house . The ceilings were low . I determined within a few steps that the man was a bachelor . That relieved me . Beyond the kitchen , a narrow hall of dusky paneling absorbed my light beam . The dcor was not extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - obscure oil paintings , antique vases , and ceramic sculptures . Undoubtedly the truly expensive bric-a-brac was stashed in a safe or strong room . I did n't care about that ; I was hunting for a name , a name certain to be scribbled in Renfro 's personal files . The shipwrecked living room was a blow to my composure . However , even before I entered that demolished area , my wind was up . I felt as a man tiptoeing through a diorama blown to life size . As if the outer reaches of the house were a faade that had not quite encompassed the yard . Mr. Renfro had been on a working vacation , by the evidence . Mounds of wet dirt were heaped around a crater . Uprooted boards lay in haphazard stacks . Sawed joists gleamed like exposed ribs . The pit was deep and ugly - a cavity . I turned away and released a sluice of vodka , tomato juice , and oyster chunks . Purged , I felt better than I had in days . I skirted the destruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarred the carpet , merging into a muddy path - the trail a beast might pound with its blundering mass . If Renfro made the prints , I figured him for around six feet , two hundred forty . Not quite in my league , but hefty enough that I was happy to grip the sturdy flashlight . A metal bucket was discarded on the landing . Inside the upper bathroom , the clawfoot tub had cracked , overflowing dirt and nails . The sink was shattered . Symbols had been scrawled above the toilet with mud , but the flowery paper hung in shreds . I deciphered the letters MAG and MMON . A cockroach clambered up the wall , fell , started again . Its giant , horned silhouette crossed mine . I did n't linger . I peeked in the master bedroom to be thorough . It too was victim of hurricane savagery . The bed was stripped , sheets wadded on the floor amid drifts of clothes . A set of designer luggage had barely survived ; buckles and zippers sprung , meticulously packed articles disgorged like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip before whatever happened , happened . Renfro had converted the spare bedroom to an office . Here were toppled oak file cabinets , contents strewn and stomped . My prize was a semi-collapsed desk , buried in a landslide of paper . Its sides bore gouges and impact marks . Thankfully Renfro had n't filled this room with dirt . I searched for his Rolodex amid the chaos , keeping an eye on the door . The house was empty , obviously the house was empty . Renfro was n't likely to be lurking in a closet . He was n't likely to come shambling into the office , caked with mud and blood and fondling a hatchet . I still kept an eye on the door . A drawer contained more file hangers . Inside the R-T folder was an index card with A. THORNTON ( Imago Colony ) written in precise block letters , a Purdon address which was probably a drop box , a list of names that meant nothing to me , and an unmarked cassette tape . Actually the label had been smudged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On impulse I checked the Ws and found a listing for T.WILSON . Parallax Alpha was penned in the margin . Below that , in fresher ink - Provender ? Mission accomplished , I was eager to saddle up and get the hell out of Tombstone . Then my light illuminated the edge of a wrinkled photograph of Stanford lacrosse players assembled on a field . A dated shot , but I recognized a younger Renfro from the brochure in my pocket . He knelt front and center , sporting a permed Afro and a butterfly collar . His eyes and mouth were holes . They reminded me of how Teddy 's mouth looked in his war pictures . They also reminded me of the pit Renfro had excavated in his living room . Behind the team , where campus buildings should logically be , reared the basalt ridge of a mountain . A flinty spine wreathed by primordial steam . This was Teddy 's photo collection redux . And there were more delights . I considered vomiting again . I stared for a bit , turning the photo this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers shook . I sorted the papers again , including the pile on the floor , examining the various photographs and postcards that were salted through the general mess . Some framed , some not . Wallet-sized to the kind Grandma hangs above the mantle . This time I actually looked and beheld a pattern that my subconscious had recognized already . Each picture was warped , each was distorted . Each was a fake , a fabrication designed to unnerve the viewer . What other purpose could they serve ? I checked for splice marks , hints of computer grafting , as if my untrained eye could 've helped . Nothing to explain the mechanics of the hoax . The terrain was wrong in all of these . Very wrong . The sky was not quite the same sky we walked around under every day . No , the sky in the more peculiar photos appeared somewhat viscous with bubbles and spot discoloration - the sky was a solid . As a matter of fact , it kind of resembled amber . Shapes that might 've been blimps hovered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was enough spooky bullshit for me . I beat feet . Downstairs , I hesitated at the pit . I shined my lonely beam into the gloom . It was about twelve feet deep , - the sides crumbled and seeped groundwater . A nasty thought had been ticking in my brain . Where is Renfro ? In the hole , of course . Which suggested he was hiding - or lying in wait . I did n't actually want to find him either way . Thornton 's information was in my pocket . Assuming it panned out , there were many hours of driving ahead . But the nasty thought was ticking louder , getting closer . Why is Renfro digging a hole under his very nice house ? Wow , I wonder if it 's related to his screwed up picture collection ! And , oh , do you think it has anything to do with a certain photograph on loan to his precious gallery ? Do you suppose he spent long , long hours in front of that picture , fixated , neglecting his duties until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call us , we 'll call you . There was a lot of debris at the bottom of that hole . A lot of debris and the light was dimming as its batteries gave up the ghost and I could n't be one hundred percent sure , but I glimpsed an earthen lump down there , right where the darkness thickened . A man-sized lump . At its head was a damp depression in which a small object glinted . When I hit it with the light , it flickered . Blinked , blinked . 6 . I WANTED TO TURN around and bolt for home , get back to my beer and cartoons . I headed for Purdon instead . A Mastodon sinking in a tar pit . Purdon was a failed mill town several hours northeast of San Francisco - victim of the rise of environmentalist ! ! in the latter " 90s . A mountainous region bracketed by a national park and a reservation . Rural and impoverished as all hell . Plenty of pot plantations , militia compounds , and dead mining camps ; all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly being eaten by forest . An easy place to vanish from the planet . My mind had been switched off for the last hundred miles . I switched it off because I was tired of thinking about the events at Renfro 's house . Tired of considering the implications . It occurred to me , not for the first time , that I had fallen down the rabbit hole and would awaken at any moment . Unfortunately , I had brought a couple of the suspect photos and they remained steadfastly bizarre . Combined with Teddy 's , did this not suggest a supernatural force at work ? Thoughts like that are why I shut my mind off . Better to stick with problems at hand . Problems such as motoring into the sticks looking for a man I had seen in ancient clippings and a jerky movie frame shot three decades prior . A man who was probably a certifiable lunatic if he had owned the Imago Sequence for so many years . Whether he might know the whereabouts of a petrified homirrid , or the truth about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . The only matter of importance was finding a way to kill the nightmares . And if Thornton could n't help me ? Best not to scrutinize that possibility too closely . I could almost taste the cold , oily barrel of my revolver . I played Reniro 's tape . The recording was damaged - portions were garbled , others were missing entirely , comprised of clicking and deep sea warbles . The intelligible segments featured a male lecturer . " - satiation is the natural inclination . One is likely to spend centuries glutting primitive appetites , wreaking havoc on enemies , and so forth . What then2 . That depends on the personality . Few would seek the godhead , I think . Such a pursuit would require tremendous imagination , determination ... resources . Provender would be an issue . It is difficult to conceive the acquisition of so much ripe flesh . No , the majority will be content with leisurely hedonism - " The Chrysler groaned as it climbed . Night paled and the rain slackened into gray drizzle . Big hills , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the road fell apart . I had to pay attention lest my car be hurled into a ravine . " - consumption of accelerated brainmatter being one proven catalyst . Immersion in a protyle sink JK significantly more efficacious , albeit infinitely more perilous . Best avoided . " Laughter . The recording petered to static . I reached Purdon in time for church . Instead , I filled my tank at the Union 76 next to the defunct lumber mill , washed and changed clothes in the cramped bathroom . At the liquor store I bought a bottle of cheap whiskey . Here was my indemnity from coming nightmares . Then I ate a huge breakfast at the Hardpan Caf . The waitress , who might also have been the proprietor , was a shrewd-eyed Russian . There were a lot of Russian immigrants in the area , I discovered . She did n't care for my looks , but she kept my coffee cup level and her thoughts to herself while I stared out the window and plotted my next move . Not much to see - narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEASE signs plastered dark windows . A few people , mostly hungover men , prowled the sidewalks . Everybody appeared to wear flannel and drive dented pickups . Most of the trucks had full gun racks . I asked the Russian woman about finding a room and was directed to the Pine Valley Motel , which was less lovely than it sounded - unless you were thinking pine box , and then , yeah , that was more accurate , in an esthetic sense . The motel sprawled in a gravel lot at the edge of town , northernmost wing gutted by a recent fire and draped with rust-stained tarps . Mine was the sole car parked in front . A stoic senior citizen missing two fingers of his right hand took my money and produced the key . His stained ballcap read : PURDON MILL - AN AMERICAN COMPANY ! For fun , I asked if he knew anything about Anselm Thornton or the Imago Colony and received a glassy stare as he honked his nose into a handkerchief . The walls of No. 32 were balsa-thin and the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I counted myself lucky as I cracked the seal on the whiskey . I made it to within a pinky of the bottom before the curtain dropped . Ants . I shared a picnic with a woman who was the composite of several women , all of them attractive , all of them wanton yet motherly , like the new Betty Cracker . She spoke words that held no weight and so fluttered away on the breeze with a vapor trail of pollen . Our feast was laid upon the requisite checkerboard blanket beneath a flowering tree with the grass and the sun and all that . With all that and the chirping birds and the painfully blue sky and the goddamned ants ; I did n't notice the ants until the woman held a slice of bread to my lips and as I opened my mouth to accept the bread I saw an ant trapped in the honey . Too late , my mouth closed and I swallowed and I looked down and beheld them everywhere upon the checker cloth , these ants . Formicating . I rose up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff s of dust . They died in their numbers , complaining in small voices as their works were conculcated - their wagon trains and caravans , their miniature Hippodromes and coliseums , their monuments and toy superstructures , all crashed , all toppled , all ablaze . I threw my head back to bellow curses and noticed the sun had become a pinhole . The hole openedopenedopened - Open . I stared at the ceiling and realized that I now slept with my eyes wide and glazed . Marbles , the last of my marbles . Shadows flowed swiftly along the decrepit wallpaper of No. 32 , shrinking from the muzzy glare of the sun as it wallowed behind clouds . The thermostat was set at body temperature and the room steamed . I did n't recall waking to do that . I had slept for eighteen hours . Eighteen hours ! It was a bloody miracle ! I dressed , avoiding the mirror . There were various stratagems available , a couple of them clever . I was n't feeling clever , though . In fact , my skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapshot of Teddy at the locals , finally got a bite from the mechanic at the gas station . He remembered Teddy from the previous September - Heavy guy , yeah ; drivin " a foreign car , passin " through . North , I suppose , " cause he asked where Little Egypt was . We get that a lot . Tourists want to fool around the mines . Ai n't shit-all left , though . I checked his brakes - these roads are hell on brakes . He paid cash . No surprises , the jigsaw was taking its form . I measured the dwindling girth of my money clip and dealt a portion of it to Rod , the pimply badger of a clerk at the post office . It went down smoothly after I told him I was working for a family who believed their baby girl had joined a cult . Oh , this sweaty , mutton-chopped fellow became a regular Samaritan once the folding green was in his pocket . He came across with the goods - names and descriptions of the people who regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't know much about him and did n't want to . The Imago Colony ? Zip . Thornton 's group numbered about forty , although who knew ? - what with tourist season and the influx of visitors come spring . They occupied mining claims somewhere on Little Egypt ; kept to themselves . Mormons , or some shit . Weird folk , but nobody had heard about them causing trouble before . He let me look at a topographical map that showed Little Egypt was , in fact , a sizable chunk of real estate . Thornton 's camp could be any one of a dozen claims scattered throughout the area . I slipped him another fifty bucks to keep mum about our conversation . Satisfied , I retreated to the Hardpan Caf , which commanded an unobstructed view of the post office . I settled in to wait for my hippie friends to make the scene . The Russian lady was overjoyed . Thornton 's people arrived on Thursday . Two rough men dressed in greatcoats ; they drove around town in a clanking two-ton truck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious off-road travel . The U.S Army Star was mud-splattered . I compared them to my list . One , a redhead , was a nobody . The other man was middling sized , with a dented forehead , pebbly eyes and a long beard that would 've made Fidel Castro jealous . Roy Fulcher , larger and uglier than life . Still playing henchman to Thornton in the new century . Loyal as a dog ; how sweet . If any of the locals tipped the men that I had been asking about their operation , it was not evident . They nonchalantly gathered supplies while I lurked in the background . Toward evening Fulcher pointed the truck north and rumbled off with a load of dry goods , fuel , and mail . I trailed . Eventually , the truck turned onto a gravel road . A bullet-riddled sign read : LITTLE EGYPT RD . The metal pole was bent nearly double , victim of unknown violence . Rough country here ; patches of concrete-hard snow gleamed under scraggly trees . In a few miles gravel gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chrysler . I pulled over , shouldered a satchel I 'd bought at the Purdon Thrifty Saver and started walking , carefully picking my way as twilight grew moss and the stars glittered like caltrops . As the air cooled , mist cloaked the branches and brambles . The hills got steep fast , draining the strength from my legs . My back protested . I shook most of the bottle of aspirin into my mouth to stay on the safe side , and rested frequently . When the track forked , 1 shined my flashlight to orient on the freshest ruts . It was n't difficult ; it was like following a bulldozer up the mountain . I clicked the light off quickly , hoping to conceal my position , and continued trudging . I checked my watch to gauge the mileage and discovered it had died at 6:32 P.M. Much later , my legs got too heavy and I slumped under a lonely pine . Clouds snuffed the stars . 7 . THE GRAY LIGHT swam as it brightened ; rocks and brush solidified all around . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corpse . My back had seized up . It hurt in a profound way . Like a bitch , as my pop would 've said . The aspirin was gone , the whiskey too . It seemed impossible that I would ever stand . But I rose , among a shower of black motes and silvery comets . Rose with the chuffing sob of a steer as it is goaded onto the gangway . Then I hugged my homely little tree , pissed on my boots and trembled with nausea . I needed a drink . The road curved upward in a series of switchbacks . The snow disintegrated to brown sludge . I staggered along the shoulder , avoiding the quagmire . My feet got wet anyway . I clutched at exposed roots and outcroppings . A bird scolded me . Cresting a saddle in the hills , I gazed upon the flank of a mountain about a quarter-mile off . Shacks were scattered beneath the crags - tin roofs bled orange tracks in the snow . The truck Fulcher had driven was parked alongside two battered jeeps near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chugged forth from several stacks . A knot of muddy pigs huddled in a paddock . Nothing else moved . My glance fell upon a trio of silhouetted formations farther along the mountainside ; too far to discern clearly . Pylons ? The instant I spotted them a whisper of unease urged me to look elsewhere . To flee , yes . I patted the bulk of the revolver in my pocket and the whispers slithered away . I gulped air and wished I 'd thought to bring field glasses for this expedition . Keeping to the brush , I swung a wide northwest circle . As I drew closer to the pylons , it registered that about a dozen jutted randomly above the stony field . Crows danced atop them , squawking their hideous argot . An unpleasant sensation of primitive familiarity rooted me in my tracks . The objects were made of milled poles planted at angles like kingsized X 's , each twice the height of a man . Symbols were carved into them . Latin ? The farthest structure had something caught at its apex - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned . A man in a billowing poncho strode from the direction of the camp . He waved and I waved back automatically . The brush must not have concealed me so well after all . He walked swiftly , a stop-motion figure on grainy film . The haze had a spaghetti-western effect - it made him taller and shorter by turns and cast his face in gloom . " Mr. Thornton ? " I said when he halted before me . God , he was tall . I was no midget and I had to crane my neck at him . " Welcome to the Pleasure Dome . Glad you could make it . We seldom receive visitors during the winter season . " He sounded British and wore an Australian-style drover 's hat pulled low over jagged brows and scaly eyes . Potbellied and thick through the hips , yet gangly and muscular the way a well-fed raptor is muscular . His enormous hands hung loosely . A thin-lipped mouth threatened to bisect his broad , sallow face . Lots and lots of stained crooked teeth were revealed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Ticktock go the mitochondria - a nova in bloom . Marvelous , marvelous . " I stared at him and decided he was far too spry for a fellow pushing seventy-five . His movements were quick and powerful . His doll-smooth flesh radiated youthful heat . " Who told you I was coming ? " I suspected someone at the Weston Gallery had phoned with the news . Were there phones up here ? Thornton hesitated as if he actually meant to answer the question . " Come back to the house . The ground is unsafe . " " Unsafe how ? " " Not all the shafts are properly sealed . Holes everywhere . Periodically someone disappears - they come poking around for souvenirs or gold and ... well , one misstep is all it takes . Teenagers , usually . Or tourists . " I nodded in idiot silence , grappling with my instincts - my mind was a cacophony of ghostly exhortations to rap this man 's head while we were away from his presumed horde of disciples , to put him on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answers to a dozen pertinent questions . I recalled the lumpish shape at the bottom of Renfro 's hole , how it shuddered and quaked , and my hand dipped into my pocket " How 's Jacob , anyway ? " Thornton had already turned his back . Maybe he was grinning . His dry , Victorian accent quavered up the register toward that of a crone 's . " Jacob . " It seemed to be getting darker by the second in that desolate valley . " The fellow who sent you to break my legs and whatnot . He misses his uncle . Kidding , kidding . Do you miss Teddy ? Does anyone ? It would be decent . " " You know Jacob ? " " Not really . His uncle and I were friends , once . Teddy lived on the edge of my circle . I never gathered the impression he spoke of me to anyone ... uninitiated . Jacob would not suit my purposes . " " I 'm here to find out what happened to Teddy . " " Truly ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , I 'm kind of stuck on the chicken or the egg theory . I 'll take whatever I can get . So give . " " Teddy vanished . A boating accident , was n't it ? " " After visiting you . " " Teddy was a big boy . Big enough for both of us . Remove your hand from the gun , Marvin . Harm me and you 'll never get what you came for . " My lungs burned . " Harm you . There 's no reason . Is there ? " " For some men , there is always a reason . It 's what you do well , hurting . You 're a terrier . I know everything about you , Marvin . I smell meanness cooking in your blood . The blood on your hands . I ask , do you want blood from me , or knowledge ? Here is a crossroads . " " I want to know about the photographs . I need to understand what 's happening to me . " I said this simply , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not only happening to you . It 's happening to everyone , everywhere . You 're tuned in to the correct frequency , and therein lies the difference . " Thorn ton twisted his oversized head to regard me without shifting his shoulders . His face was milky . A face of unwholesome flexibility ; and yes , his grin fetched to mind sickles and horns . " Let 's amble - we 'll do lunch , we 'll chat . I 'll show you my gallery . It 's an amazing gallery . I 'll show you Imago . You 'll enjoy it , Marvin . You 'll sleep again . Sleep without nightmares . " He was walking before he finished , beckoning with a casual twitch of his hand . His oilskin poncho slithered in his wake not unlike a tail . I followed on wooden legs . Crows argued behind us . The Quonset hut was so old its floor was a sunken mass of caramelized wood and dirt . An arch in the rear opened to darkness . Moth-eaten banners of curiously medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long table where I mechanically chewed a ham sandwich and drank a sour beer that Roy Fulcher had fetched . Thornton had departed , promising a swift return . He asked Fulcher to attend to my needs . Light oozed through window glass that sagged and pooled at the bottom of rotten frames . Crates made pyramids against the walls , alongside boxes , barrels , and stacks of curling newspapers . Homey . Fulcher watched me eat . His features were vulpine and his lank beard was stained yellow-brown around the mouth . He smelled ripe . Farther off , a group of fellow colonists played at a ping-pong table . They cast sly glances our way and chuckled with suppressed brutality . Four men , two women , ages indeterminate . They were scrawny , haggard and unwashed . Several more came and went , shuffling . Zombies but for a merry spark in their eyes , satisfied smirks . I said , " Here 's the million-dollar question - where 's the caveman buried ? " " Caveman ? I do n't think there 's a caveman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasal drawl that smacked of coal mines and tarpaper shanties . " All this trouble and no caveman ? " " Sorry . " " It 's okay . Jacob will get over it , " I said . " I do n't suppose you 'll tell me where Ammon took the Imago Sequence ! That wo n't hurt anything , if there 's no caveman . " Fulcher leaned in . " Take a spoon and dig a hole in your chest . That 's where he made his pictures . " I pushed my plate aside . I wiped my lips with a dingy cloth towel . I stared at him , long and steadily . I said , " If you wo n't talk about Ammon , tell me about your colony . Love what you 've done with the place . What do you guys do for fun in these parts ? " I 'd cultivated a talent for reading people , weighing them at a glance , separating shepherds from sheep . It was nothing special ; a basic survival technique - but it came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I in a commune or a militia compound ? Were these hippie cultists , leftwing anarchists , or something else ? I gave one of the more brazen ping-pong players - the redhead from town - a hard look . Fulcher had called him Clint . Glint 's grin vanished and he concentrated on his game . Human , at least . " You know , " Fulcher said . " I hate word games , Roy . They make me hostile . " " Ask Anselm . " " I 'm asking you . " " It brought you to us - one from multitudes . You still question what our work is here ? " " It ? If you mean the Imago Sequence , then yeah , I 'm full of questions . " " Anselm will answer your questions in due course . " " Well , Roy , problem is , I 'm kind of stupid . People usually need to repeat stuff . " Fulcher 's expression grew rigid . " You do n't want to see . Surprise it 's too late . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretenses , will soon be blown apart . I doubt it will profit you in the least . You 're a thug . " " Story of my life ; nobody likes me . I guess you 'd be willing to show me the big picture . Shoot me down with your intellectual superiority . " " Anselm will show you the cosmic picture , Mr. Cortez . " " Is n't it customary for you religious zealots to have pamphlets lying around ? Betcha there 's a printing press somewhere in this Taj Mahal . Surely you 've got propaganda for the recruits ? And beads ? I like beads . " " No pamphlets , no recruits . This is Imago Colony . Religion does n't apply . " " Oh , no ? What 's with all the faux Roman crucifixes in the back forty ? " " The crucifixes ? Those are authentic . Anselm imported them . " I tried to wrap my mind around that concept . The implications eluded me . I said , " Bullshit . What the hell for ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He enjoys aspects of cultural antiquity . " " Yeah , so I hear . And he has a thing about bugs , I guess , - sort of similar to his mentor. seems to be a reliable pattern with lunatics . An imago is an insect , right ? " " It 's symbolic . " . " Oh . I thought the bug thing was cute . " " An imago is not any insect . The final instar of an insect , its supreme incarnation . Care for another beer ? " " I 'm good . " I gestured at the ping-pong tournament . " Weedy crowd , Roy . Somebody told me there were forty , fifty of you in this camp . " " Far less , these days . Attrition . " " Uh-huh . " " You 've come during harvest season , Mr. Cortez . That 's what we do in the cold months . The others are engaged , those who remain . Things will quicken in the spring . People seem to be more driven to enlightenment during sandal weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wives and kiddies . We get all kinds . " " Thornton is off to play plantation overseer , eh ? I wonder what you kids harvest in these parts - poppies ? Opium is Afghanistan 's chief export - ask the Taliban what it paid for its military hardware , the light bills in its palaces . The climate around here is about goddamned ideal . You 'd be millionaires . I 've got a couple pals , line you right out for a piece of the pie . " Fulcher rubbed his dented brow , smiled . " What wonderful irony ! We do love to trip . You have me there . Poppies , that 's very funny . I almost miss those days . I stick with cigarettes anymore . " " Lay your gimmick on me . " " Evolution . " " You and everybody else . " " What do people want ? " Fulcher raised his grimy hand to forestall my answer . " What do people truly want - what would induce a man to sell his soul ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said with mild sarcasm . Mild because as I uttered the punch line to the children 's rhyme , coldness began to unfold in my bones . The tumblers in my head were turning again . " Bravo , Mr. Cortez . Power , wisdom , immortality . " His expression altered . " We have found something that will afford us ... longevity , at least . With longevity comes everything else . " " The Fountain of Youth ? " In the deep mountain woods a mossy statue spurted black water . Congregations of hillbillies in coveralls bathed in its viscid pool . A bonfire , a forest of uncured pelts swaying . A piper . I shuddered . " Dancing girls , winning lotto tickets ? " " A catalyst . A mechanism that compresses aeons of future human evolution . Although future is a relative term . " " Ammon 's photographs . " It seemed obvious . Everything seemed patently obvious , except that the room was undulating and I could n't figure out who was playing the flute . A panpipe , actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . Fulcher ignored the music . He flushed , warming to my edification . " The Imago Sequence is a trigger . If you 've got the right genes , you might already be a winner . " I rubbed my ear ; the pipe raised unpleasant specters to mind , set them gibbering . The monstrous hominid opened its mouth wider , wider . " How does that shit work ? " " Take a picture of God , tack it on the wall and see who bows . Recognition is the key . It does n't make a difference what you comprehend intellectually , only what stirs on a cellular level , what awakens when it recognizes the wellspring of creation . " " Do n't tell me you believe the caveman is God . " " I said there 's no caveman . Look deeper , friend . Reality lies beyond the surface . It 's not the Devil in the details , it 's God . " " Aha ! You are a bunch of Christian cultists . " " We do not exist to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to appreciate slavish devotion . " " Seems pointless to have a god at all , when you put it like that . " " Do you supplicate plutonium ? Do you sing hymns to uranium ? We bask in the corona of an insensate majesty . In its sway we seek to lay the foundation blocks of a new city , a new civilization . We 're pioneers . Our frontier is the grand wasteland between Alpha and Omega . " " Will you transform into a being of pure energy and migrate to Alpha Centauri ? " " Quite opposite . Successful animal organisms are enduring organisms . Enduring organisms are extremely basic , extremely efficient . Tarantulas . Scorpions . Reptiles . Flies . " " Do n't forget cockroaches . They 're going to inherit the Earth . " I laughed , began coughing . The room wobbled . " So Thornton is what - the messiah helping you become the best imago you can be ? " " Anselm is the Imago . We are maggots . We are provender . " " I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slops . " " It is good to have a purpose in life . To be an integral part of the great and terrible cycle . " Fulcher shook his head . " As I serve him , he served Ammon , and Ammon served the one before him down through time gone to dust . " By sating the image of the Power they fulfill their fleshly contract . By suckling the teat of godliness the worthy shall earn their reward . " Thus it is written in a book much more venerable than the Bible . For we who survive to remake ourselves in the image of the Power , all risks are acceptable . " " Reverend Jones rides again ! Pass the grape Kool-Aid ! " " Hysterical , much ? " " Naw , just lately . " I took a breath . " I wonder though , what does a guy do after he reaches the top of the ol " ladder ? Live in a cave and compose epic poetry ? Answer riddles ? Pick up a sword and lay waste to Rome ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't know what to say to that . I plowed ahead . " Well ? " " Basic organisms require basic pleasures . " " Basic pleasures ? " The chilly sensation linked hands with vertigo and did a Scottish jig . I was as a figurine in that enormous room . " Subsistence and copulation . That 's what the good life boils down to , my friend . Eating and fucking . Whoever you want , whatever you want , whenever you want . " The mouth opening , opening " Power to the people . " I was slurring . Why was I slurring ? " Ready to go ? " Fulcher rose , still smiling through his matted beard . We walked through the tall archway . He lightly gripped my elbow to steady me . One beer and I was drunk as a sailor on the third day of shore leave . The corridor expanded in the best Escher fashion , telescoping into infinite shadow . There were ragged tapestries at intervals , disfigured statues , a well-trammeled carpet with astrological designs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ages of smoke . At one fork , a kerosene lamp swung on a sooty chain . Behind a massive iron door the piping shrilled , died , shrilled . Hoarse screams of the primordial sex act , exhausted sobs , laughter and applause . Mrs. Chin 's photograph haunted me . . . . " The gallery , " Fulcher said . I recognized the musk upon him , finally . For a horrible moment I thought we would go through that door . We continued down the other hall . Fulcher brought me to a dingy chamber lit by a single dirty bulb in an overhead cage . The room was windowless and bare except for a large chair made of wood and iron . The chair had arm straps and leg shackles ; an artifact from the Spanish Inquisition . It was not difficult to picture the fallen bishops , the heretical nobles who had shrieked in its embrace . " Please , make yourself comfortable . " Fulcher helped me along with a shove . I slumped in the strange chair , my head heavy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty looking bowie knife and expertly sliced off my clothes . When he encountered the revolver he emptied the cylinder , slid the weapon into his waistband without comment . He cinched my arms and legs ; his fingers glowed , dragging tracers as they adjusted buckles and straps . Seemingly he had grown extra arms . I could only gawk at this phantasm ; I felt quite docile . " Wow , Roy . What was in my beer ? I feel terrific . " " One should hope . You ingested five hundred milligrams of synthetic mescaline - enough to launch a rhinoceros into orbit . " " Party foul , and on the first date too . I thought you did n't do dope anymore . " " I dabble in the manufacturing end of the spectrum . Frankly , all that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo about hallucinogens affecting perception in a meaningful way is wishful thinking . Poor Huxley . " Fulcher stepped back , surveyed his handiwork while rolling a cigarette . The yellow flare of his lighter painted his face , made him a devil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've seen Alpha and Beta . As my pappy would say , you 've got the taint , boy . " He blurred around the edges . With each inhalation the cherry of his cigarette brightened , became Jupiter 's red sore . I noticed the walls were metallic - whorls whorled , pits and pocks formed . Condensation trickled . Smoke made arabesques and demons . The walls were a tapestry from a palace in Hell . The panpipe started wheedling again and Thornton entered the room on cue . He pushed a rickety hospital tray with a domed cover . The cover was scalloped , silver finish flaking . A maroon handprint smeared its curve . " This is a bad sign , " I said . Thornton was efficient . He produced an electric razor and shaved a portion of my head to stubble , dug a thumb under my carotid artery and traced veins in my skull with a felt-tip pen . He tweaked my nose in a fatherly manner , stripped off his coat and rolled his sleeves to the elbows . His skin gleamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling . Shoals of phantom fish scattered above , regrouped and swam into an abyss ; a superhighway and its endless traffic looped beneath my feet ; it rippled and collapsed into a trench of unimaginable depths . I watched him remove a headpiece from the tray - a clumsy framework of clamps and screws ; a dunce cap with a collar . Parts had never been cleaned . I wanted to scream when he fitted it over my head and neck , locked it in place with a screwdriver . I sighed . Fulcher stubbed his cigarette , produced a palm-sized digital camera and aimed it at me . He gave Thornton a thumbs-up . Thornton selected a scalpel from the instruments on the tray , weighed it in his hand . " Teddy was a friend - I would never use him as provender , but neither could I set him on the path to Olympus . There 's limited room in the boat , you see . Weak , genetically flawed , but a jolly nice fellow . A gentleman . Imagine my disappointment when he showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old goat bought Parallax Alpha , he 'd viewed Beta as well . He demanded to see Imago . As if I could simply snap my fingers and show him . Would n't listen to reason , would n't go home and fall to pieces quietly like a good boy . So I enlightened him . It was out of my hands after that . Now , we come to you . " He sliced my forehead , peeled back a flap of skin . Fulcher taped it down . " What ? " I said . " What ? " Thornton raised a circular saw with a greasy wooden handle . He attached it to a socket in my headpiece . " Trephination . An ancient method to open the so-called Third Eye . Fairly crude ; Ammon taught me how and a Polynesian tribe showed him - he was n't a surgeon either . He performed his own in a Bangkok opium den with a serrated knife and a corkscrew while a stoned whore held a mirror . Fortunately , medical expertise is not a requisite in this procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze . I sighed again , saddened by wisdom acquired too late in the day . Thornton patted me kindly . His touch lingered as a caress . " Do n't fret , it 's not a lobotomy . You wished to behold Imago , this is the way . What an extraordinary specimen you are , Marvin , my boy . Your transformation will be a most satisfying conquest as I have not savored in years . I am sure to delay your reintegration for the span of many delightful hours . I will have compensation for your temerity . " " Mr. Thornton , " I gasped ; trembled with the effort of rolling my eye to meet his . " Mrs. Chin said the glacier is coming . I dream it every night ; flies buzzing in my brain . It 's killing me . That 's why I came . " Thornton nodded . " Of course . I 've seen it a thousand times . Everyone who has crawled into my lair wanted to satisfy one desire or another . What will satisfy you , O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He yawned . " Would you be happy to learn there is but one God and that all things come from Him ? Existence is infinitely simple , Marvin - cells within cells , dreams within dreams , from the molten Fingertip of God Almighty , to the antenna of a roach , on this frequency and each of a billion after . Thus it goes until the circuit completes its ambit of the core , a protean-reality where dwells an intellect of surpassing might , yet impotent , bound as it is in the well of its own gravity . Cognition does not flourish in that limitless quagmire , the cosmic repository of information . The lightning of Heaven is reduced to torpid impulses that spiral outward , seeking gratification by osmosis . And by proxy . We are bags of nerves and electrolytes , fragile and weak , and we decompose so quickly . Which is the purpose , the very cunning design . Our experiences are readily digested to serve the biological imperative of a blind , vast sponge . Does it please you ? Do you require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw-teeth . Thornton casually pressed this spike into my skull , seated it with a few taps of a rubber mallet . He put his lips next to my ear . His breath reeked copper . " The prophets proclaim the end is near . I 'll whisper to you something they do n't know - the world ended this morning as you were sleeping , half-frozen on the mountainside . It ended aeons before your father squirted his genetic material into your mother . It will end tomorrow as it ends every day , same time , same station . " He started cranking . Listening to the rhythmic burr of metal on bone , I was thankful the mescaline had soldered my nerve endings . Thornton divided and divided again until he crowded the room . Pith helmets , top hats , arctic coats , khakis , corporate suits , each double dressed for a singular occasion , each one animated by separate experience , but all of them smiling with tremendous pleasure as they turned the handle , turned the handle , turned the handle . Their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw , and moist , and dark . I glimpsed the face of the future and failed to comprehend its shape . Blood poured into my eyes . The panpipe went mad . 8 . THE WORLD ENDS every day . Picture me walking in a rock garden under the dipping branches of cherry blossom trees . I love stones and there are heavy examples scattered across the garden ; olive-bearded , embedded in the tough sod . God 's voice echoes as through a gigantic gramophone horn , but softly from the lead plate of sky , and not God , it 's Thornton guiding the progression , driving an auger into my skull while the music plays . Push it aside , keep moving toward a mound in the distance .... No Thornton , auger , no music ; only God , the garden , and I. Where is God ? Everywhere , but especially in the earth , the dark , warm earth that opens as a cave mouth in the side of a hill . God calls from the hill , in voices of grinding rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , captured betwixt burning and freezing precisely as I am caught . Nor is the sleet truly sleet . A swirl of images falling , million-million shards fractured from a vast hoary mirror . There am I , and I and I a million million times , broken , melting .... I walk through God 's rock garden , trampling incarnations of myself .... Watery images flickered on the wall . A home movie with the volume lowered . Choppy because the cameraman kept adjusting to peer over the shoulder of a tall figure who attended a third person in the awful chair - my chair . The victim was not I ; it was a mirror casting a false reflection . And it was n't a movie in the strictest sense ; I detected no camera , nor aperture to project the film . More hallucinations then . More something . Teddy 's face , trapped in the conical helm ; his feet scuffed and rattled the shackles . Thornton blocked the view , elbow pumping with the practiced ease of a farmer 's wife churning butter . Muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the dim sounds persisted . Claustrophobia gagged me . I was still strapped in the chair , the helm fixed to my head . There was a hole in my head . My right eye was crusted and blind . I shuddered with chills . How much time had passed ? Where had Fulcher and Thurnton gone ? Had they shown me Imago as promised ? My memories balked . As my faculties reengaged , my fear swelled . They had shredded my clothes , confiscated my belongings , tortured me . They would kill me . That was scarcely my fear . I dreaded what else would happen first . The wall brightened with new images . Sperm vriggled , hungry and fast . A wasp made love to a tarantula , thrusting , thrusting with its stingei . Mastiffs flung themselves upon a threshing stag , dangled from its antlers like ornaments . Fire ants swarmed over a gourd half-buried in desert earth Fulcher drifted through the door , Clint at his heel . I remained limp when Fulcher scrutinized me briefly , - he flashed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He murmured to his partner , and began unbuckling my straps . Clint hung back , perhaps to guard against a revival of my aggressive philosophy . Even so , he appeared bored , distracted . I did not stir until Fulcher freed my arms . It occurred to me that the mescaline cocktail must 've worn off because I was n't feeling docile anymore . Nothing was premeditated ; my mind was well below a rational state . I pawed his face - weakly , a drunken gesture , which he brushed aside . I became more insistent , got a fistful of his beard on the next halfhearted swipe , my left hand slithered behind his neck . Fulcher pried at my wrist , twisted his head . Frantic , he braced his boot against the chair and tried to push off . His back bowed and contorted . A ghostly spicier mounted a beetle ; they clinched . Growing stronger , more purposeful , I yanked him into my lap , and his beard ripped , but that was fine . I squeezed his throat and vertebrae popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the tail . Stuff separates . Clint tried to pull Fulcher , exactly as a man will pull a comrade from quicksand . Failing , he snatched up a screwdriver and stabbed me in the ribs . No harm , my ribs were covered with a nice slab of gristle and suet . Punch a side of beef hanging from a hook and see what you get . A truck careened across a strange field riddled with holes . The vehicle juked and jived and nose-dived into the biggest hole of them all I dropped Fulcher and staggered from the chair . Glint stabbed me in the shoulder . I laughed ; it felt good . I palmed his face , clamped down with full strength . He bit me , began a thick , red stream down my arm . He choked and gargled . Bubbles foamed between my finger webs . I waltzed him on tiptoes and banged his head against a support beam . Bonk , bonk , bonk , just like the cartoons . Just like Jackson Pollack . I stopped when his facial bones sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull . I fumbled with the screws of my helm , gave it up as a hopeless cause . I left the cell and wandered along the hall , trailing one hand against the rough surfaces . People met me , passed me without recognition , without interest . These people were versions of myself . I saw a younger me dressed in a tropical shirt and a girl on my arm , me in a funeral suit and a sawedoff shotgun in my hand ; another me pale and bruised , a doughnut brace on my neck , hunched on crutches ; still another me , gray-haired , dead drunk , wild glare fixed upon the middle distance . And others , too many others coming faster until it hurt my eyes . They flowed around me , collided , disappeared into the deep , lightless throat of the hall until all possibilities were lost . Weight shifted within the bowels of Thornton 's Pleasure Dome . A ponderous door was flung wide and a chorus of damned cries echoed up the corridors . The muscles between my shoulder blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area was deserted but for a woman sweeping ashes from the barrel stove and a sturdy man in too-loose long Johns eating dinner at a table . The woman was an automaton ; she regarded me without emotion , resumed her mechanical duties . The man put aside his spoon , considering whether to challenge me . He remained undecided as I stumbled outside , bloody and birth-naked . The icy breeze plucked at my scalp , caused my wound to throb with the threat of a migraine . I was in a place far removed from such concerns . A better man would 've set a match to the drums of diesel , blown the place to smithereens Hollywood style . No action star , I headed for the vehicles . Twilight cocooned the valley . The sky was smooth as opal . A crimson band pulsed at the horizon - the sun elongated to its breaking point . Clouds scudded from invisible distances , flew by at unnatural velocity . " Do n't go , " Thornton said . A whisper , a shout . I glanced back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tiny , was receding . His many selves had merged , yet flickered beneath his skin , ready to burst forth . His voice had relinquished its command , now waned fragile , as it traveled across the gulf to find me . " You 're opening doors without any idea of where they lead . It 's a waste . Sweet God , what a waste ! " I kept walking , limping . " Marvin ! " A hot lash of hatred and appetite throbbed from his dwindling voice . " Say hello to Teddy ! " He shrank to a speck , was lost . A fleet of canvas-top trucks shimmered upon an island in a sea of velvet . They warped and ran with the fluidity of quicksilver , a kaleidoscope revolving around the original . I picked the closest truck and dragged myself inside . Keys dangled from the ignition . The helm was too tall for the cab ; I was forced to drive with my head on my shoulder . Fresh blood seeped from the wound and obscured my vision . The truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerator and sent it hurtling across the rugged valley . One road multiplied , became three roads , now six . Now , I was off the road , or the road had melted . Bizarre changes were altering the scenery , toying with my feeble perception . The mountains doubled and redoubled and underwent the transformations of millennia - a range exploding forward , rounding and shortening , another backward , rearing into a toothy crown - in the span of heartbeats . It was a rough ride . I found the knob for the headlights in time to illuminate the sinkhole a few dozen yards ahead . A rapidly widening maw . I slammed the brakes . The cab exploded with dust and smoking rubber . There was a tin-canunder-a-boot crunch and the truck yawed , paused at the rim and toppled in , nose-first . I performed a lazy belly flop through the windshield . I did n't lose consciousness , unfortunately . I bounced and felt bones crack along old fault lines . Eventually I stopped with a terrific jolt ; a feather mattress dropped on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on top of me - it had lodged in a bottleneck . Its engine shrieked momentarily , sputtered and died . I stared up at the rapidly dulling headlights , as bits of sensation returned to my extremities . Ages passed . When I finally managed to gain my knees , the world was in darkness . What was broken ? Ribs , definitely . A sprained knee that swelled as I breathed . Possibly a bone in my back had snapped ; insufficient to immobilize me , yet neither could I straighten fully . Cuts on my face and hands . The pain was minor , and that worried me . Why not worse ? I had landed in deep , spongy moss , was nearly buried from the impact . It sucked at me as 1 clambered to solid footing . The darkness was n't complete . Aqueous light leaked from slimy surfaces , the low ceiling of sweating rock . As my vision adjusted I saw moss claimed everything . Stinking moss filled crevices and fissures , was habitat of beetles and other things . Sloppy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes , sucked my ankles . This was a relatively small cave , with a single chimney jammed by the crashed truck . This was n't a mine shaft ; my animal self was positive about that . Nor did it require much heavy thinking to conclude that climbing out of there was impossible . I could n't raise my left arm above waist level . A single note from the panpipe came faintly . From below . A voice might have murmured my name - I was gasping too loudly and it did not repeat . A fissure split the rear of the cave , a cramped tunnel descended . Mastering my instincts , I followed it down . The cool air warmed , was soon moist as a panting mouth . Pungent odors clogged my nostrils , watered my eyes . Gradually , the passage widened , opening into a larger area , a cavern of great dimensions . The light strengthened , or my eyes got better , because pieces of the cavern joined as Mrs. Chin 's photos had joined . And I beheld Imago . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof was invisible but for the tips of gargantuan stalactites , all else shrouded . Moss , more moss , a garden , a forest of moss . But was it moss ? I doubted that . Moss did n't quiver where it met flesh , did n't contract as a muscle contracts . The walls glistened ; they glowed not unlike the glow which seeped from Thornton 's skin . Shadows of the world dwelt in the walls . Those most familiar to me rose from the depths like champagne bubbles . I passed Teddy 's yacht near the surface , its lines quite clean despite being encased . Further along , a seaplane was suspended on high , partially obscured by gloom . It hung , fossilized , an inverted crucifix . There were faces , a frieze of ghastly spectators massed in the tiers of an amphitheater . I averted my gaze , afraid of who I might see pithed in the bell jar . Deeper , inside folds of rock that was not rock , were glimpses of Things to Come . Houses , onion domes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rainforests and jagged mountains . And deeper , deeper yet , solar systems of pregnant globes of smothered dirt and vine , and charred stars in endless procession . I caught myself humming The Doors " " This Is The End . " I stood upon a shattered slope , weeping and laughing , and humming the song of death . Thinking probably the same thoughts any lesser primate does when confronted with apocalyptic forces . To these I added , Damn you , anyway , Jacob ! You can shove this favor in your big , flabby ass ! And , / wonder if Carol is feeding the fishl Before me lay the cavern 's boundary ; another translucent wall . This area was subtly different ; it bulged with murky reefs of dubious matter I conjured the image of coiled organs , the calcified ganglia of some Biblical colossus . Dead roots slithered from an abyss to end abysses - a primordial sea from which all life had been egurgitated . My ears popped with a sudden pressure change . I detected movement . I tried to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen asleep , and the moss shifted beneath my nerveless feet , dumped me on my ass . I flailed down the slope , which I realized was a funnel , or a trough . This occurred with excruciating slowness , but it was impossible to halt my weight once it got moving . Wherever my skin made contact with the moss I lost sensation . This was because the moss that was not moss stung with tiny barbs , stung me as a jellyfish stings . My legs , my back , right hand , then left , until everything from the neck down was anesthetized . At the bottom , by some trick of geometry , I pitched forward to lie spread-eagle against the curve of the wall . The rock softened , was vaguely gelatinous . I began to sink . Despite my numbed state , it was cold compared to the rank jungle of a cavern . Frigid . As I sank into the wall , I thought , Not a wall , a membrane . Engulfed in amber jelly , tremendous pressure built upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free it from imminent suffocation , to scream as an animal screams , dying alone in the wilderness , 1 saw a blossom of fire in the near distance . An abrupt blue-white flare that seemed to expand forever , then shrink into itself . I opened my mouth , opened my mouth The second flash was far smaller , far more remote . It faded swiftly . I do n't know if there was a third .
