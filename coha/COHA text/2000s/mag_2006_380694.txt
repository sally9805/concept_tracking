In Japan kids dance in them , figure-skating style . In Canada they glide in them to whack a street-hockey puck . And from London to St. Petersburg , preteens use them as alternative transportation . They 're Heelys , and the brand is on the move . But how does a company with $40 million in annual revenues and a slender marketing budget expand to more than 60 countries in less than five years without getting lost ? HSL Inc. , launched in late 2000 with one product , posted U.S. sales of more than $36 million last year  --  an increase of 250%  --  and about $2.4 million in Europe ( up a respectable 200% ) while the company was opening up Latin America and combatting piracy in Asia . " Our marketing strategy is universal , " says Mike Staffaroni , CEO of HSL , which is based in Carrollton , Texas . From Day One , the company has aimed at controlled distribution and growth , maintaining mystique by selling at premium-priced , higher-end retailers and " nix to the likes of Wal-Mart or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not toys , despite a target audience of 6-to-14-year-olds . <P> The key to selling the brand abroad has been keeping it hot at home . Whether in Detroit or Taipei , the company relies on grass-roots marketing . To explain how to " heel " skate on one rear wheel , the company cherry-picks a handful of cool kids , " like school athletes , " in selected schools to join Team Heelys . These paid performers demo the shoes at malls , concerts and sporting events , and they also chat up Team Heelys wannabes on the Heelys website , generating cred and buzz . <P> Staying hot means constantly retooling , chugging out upgraded wheel varieties , fashions and comfort features twice a year . HSL has also added accessories like helmets and related products . <P> Months after launching in the U.S. , HSL shipped to Japan , its first offshore market . The company could n't afford its own subsidiaries , so within each country or region it signed an exclusive distributor , which uses HSL 's global marketing strategy but handles TV advertising , local-language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved a perfect vehicle for product exposure in that densely populated country . HSL rolled out Heelys in brighter colors and produced Hello Kitty and Winnie the Pooh models to take advantage of local licensing agreements . But success spawned cheap copies , slicing HSL 's monopoly market share in half . In a neat bit of counterprogramming , however , its man in Japan recommended fighting the pirates on their turf : self-serve discounters . So HSL created Cruz , a lower-priced sub-brand , exclusively for Japan . <P> Not every local distributor has worked out . " It takes time to find the right one and to see results , " Staffaroni says . Britain started slowly but is now the No. 2 market in Europe , while sales in Russia have increased for three years . Within five years , the company hopes to distribute directly in Europe , eliminating the middleman and boosting margins . Longer term , the company wants to control distribution in South America , Canada and Mexico .                @ @ @ @ @
