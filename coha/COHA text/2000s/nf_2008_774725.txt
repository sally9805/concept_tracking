The Less Flattering Version // Omaha , June 2003 // Warren Buffett rocks back in his chair , long legs crossed at the knee behind his father Howard ? s plain wooden desk . His expensive Zegna suit jacket bunches around his shoulders like an untailored version bought off the rack . The jacket stays on all day , every day , no matter how casually the other fifteen employees at Berkshire Hathaway headquarters are dressed . His predictable white shirt sits low on the neck , its undersize collar bulging away from his tie , looking left over from his days as a young businessman , as if he had forgotten to check his neck size for the last forty years . // His hands lace behind his head through strands of whitening hair . One particularly large and messy finger-combed chunk takes off over his skull like a ski jump , lofting upward at the knoll of his right ear . His shaggy right eyebrow wanders toward it above the tortoiseshell glasses . At various times this eyebrow gives him a skeptical , knowing , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which lends the wayward eyebrow a captivating air . Nonetheless , his pale-blue eyes are focused and intent . // He sits surrounded by icons and mementos of fifty years . In the hallways outside his office , Nebraska Cornhuskers football photographs , his paycheck from an appearance on a soap opera , the offer letter ( never accepted ) to buy a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management , and Coca-Cola memorabilia everywhere . On the coffee table inside the office , a classic Coca-Cola bottle . A baseball glove encased in Lucite . Over the sofa , a certificate that he completed Dale Carnegie ? s public-speaking course in January 1952 . The Wells Fargo stagecoach , westbound atop a bookcase . A Pulitzer Prize , won in 1973 by the Sun Newspapers of Omaha , which his investment partnership owned . Scattered about the room are books and newspapers . Photographs of his family and friends cover the credenza and a side table , and sit under the hutch beside his desk in place of a computer . A large portrait of his father hangs above Buffett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It faces every visitor who enters the room . // Although a late-spring Omaha morning beckons outside the windows , the brown wooden shutters are closed to block the view . The television beaming toward his desk is tuned to CNBC . The sound is muted , but the crawl at the bottom of the screen feeds him news all day long . Over the years , to his pleasure , the news has often been about him . // Only a few people , however , actually know him well . I have been acquainted with him for six years , originally as a financial analyst covering Berkshire Hathaway stock . Over time our relationship has turned friendly , and now I will get to know him better still . We are sitting in Warren ? s office because he is not going to write a book . The unruly eyebrows punctuate his words as he says repeatedly , " You ? ll do a better job than I would , Alice . I ? m glad you ? re writing this book , not me . " Why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime , we start with the matter closest to his heart . // " Where did it come from , Warren ? Caring so much about making money ? " // His eyes go distant for a few seconds , thoughts traveling inward : flip flip flip through the mental files . Warren begins to tell his story : " Balzac said that behind every great fortune lies a crime . 1 That ? s not true at Berkshire . " // He leaps out of his chair to bring home the thought , crossing the room in a couple of strides . Landing on a mustardy-gold brocade armchair , he leans forward , more like a teenager bragging about his first romance than a seventy-two-year-old financier . How to interpret the story , who else to interview , what to write : The book is up to me . He talks at length about human nature and memory ? s frailty , then says , " Whenever my version is different from somebody else ? s , Alice , use the less flattering version . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply from observing him . Here is the first : Humility disarms. // In the end , there won ? t be too many reasons to choose the less flattering version-but when I do , human nature , not memory ? s frailty , is usually why . One of those occasions happened at Sun Valley in 1999. // Chapter Two // Sun Valley // Idaho , July 1999 // Warren Buffett stepped out of his car and pulled his suitcase from the trunk . He walked through the chain-link gate onto the airport ? s tarmac , where a gleaming white Gulfstream IV jet-the size of a regional commercial airliner and the largest private aircraft in the world in 1999-waited for him and his family . One of the pilots grabbed the suitcase from him to stow in the cargo hold . Every new pilot who flew with Buffett was shocked to see him carrying his own luggage from a car he drove himself . Now , as he climbed the boarding stairs , he said hello to the flight attendant-somebody new-and headed to a seat next to a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time during the flight . His mood was buoyant ; he had been anticipating this trip for weeks . // His son Peter and daughter-in-law Jennifer , his daughter Susan and her boyfriend , and two of his grandchildren all settled into their own caf ? au lait leather club chairs set around the forty-five-foot-long cabin . They swiveled their seats away from the curved wall panels to give themselves more space as the flight attendant brought drinks from the galley , which was stocked with the family ? s favorite snacks and beverages . A pile of magazines lay nearby on the sofa : Vanity Fair , the New Yorker , Fortune , Yachting , the Robb Report , the Atlantic Monthly , the Economist , Vogue , Yoga Journal . She brought Buffett an armload of newspapers instead , along with a basket of potato chips and a Cherry Coke that matched his red Nebraska sweater . He complimented her , chatted for a few minutes to ease her nervousness at flying for the first time with her boss , and told her that she could let the copilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he buried his head in a newspaper as the plane rolled down the runway and ascended to forty thousand feet . For the next two hours , six people hummed around him , watching videos , talking , and making phone calls , while the flight attendant set out linens and bud vases filled with orchids on the bird ? s-eye maple dining tables before returning to the galley to prepare lunch . Buffett never moved . He sat reading , hidden behind his newspapers , as if he were alone in his study at home . // They were flying in a $30 million airborne palace called a " fractional " jet . As many as eight owners shared it , but it served as part of a fleet , so all the owners could fly at once if they wished . The pilots in the cockpit , the crew that maintained it , the schedulers who got it to the gate on six hours ? notice , and the flight attendant who served their lunch all worked for NetJets , which belonged to Warren Buffett ? s company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snake River Plain and approached the Sawtooth Mountains , a vast Cretaceous upheaval of dark and ancient granite mounds baking in the summer sun . It sailed through the bright clear air into the Wood River Valley , descending to eight thousand feet , where it started to buck on the mountain wave of turbulence thrown into the sky by the brown foothills beneath . Buffett read on , unperturbed , as the plane rocked and his family jerked about in their seats . Brush dotted higher altitudes of a second ridge of hills and rows of pines began their march up the ridges between ravines on the leeward side . The family grinned with anticipation . As the aircraft descended through the narrowing slot between the rising mountain peaks ahead , the midday sun cast the plane ? s lengthening shadow over the old mining town of Hailey , Idaho . // A few seconds later , the wheels touched down on the Friedman Memorial Airport runway . By the time the Buffetts had bounded down the stairs onto the tarmac , squinting in the July sunshine , two SUVs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet , driven by men and women from Hertz . They all wore the company ? s gold-and-black shirts . Instead of Hertz , however , the logo said " Allen &amp; Co. " // The grandchildren bounced on their heels as the pilots unloaded the luggage , tennis rackets , and Buffett ? s red-and-white Coca-Cola golf bag into the SUVs . Then he and the others shook hands with the pilots , said good-bye to the flight attendant , and climbed into the SUVs . Bypassing Sun Valley Aviation- a pocket-size trailer at the runway ? s southern end-they swung through the chain-link gate onto the road that led to the peaks beyond . About two minutes had elapsed since the plane ? s wheels first touched the runway . // Right on schedule , eight minutes later , another jet followed theirs , headed to its own runway parking spot . // Throughout the golden afternoon , jet after jet cruised into Idaho from the south and east or swung around the peaks from the west and descended into Hailey : workhorse Cessna Citations ; glamorous , close-quartered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awe-inspiring G-IVs . As the afternoon waned , dozens of huge , gleaming white aircraft lined the runway like a shop window full of tycoons ? toys . // The Buffetts followed the trail blazed by earlier SUVs a few miles onward from the airport to the tiny town of Ketchum on the edge of the Sawtooth National Forest , near the turnoff to the Elkhorn Pass . A few miles later , they rounded Dollar Mountain , where a green oasis appeared , nestled among the brown slopes . Here amid the lacy pines and shimmering aspens lay Sun Valley , the mountains ? most fabled resort , where Ernest Hemingway began writing For Whom the Bell Tolls , where Olympic skiers and skaters had long made their second home . // The tide of families they were joining this Tuesday afternoon all had some connection to Allen &amp; Co. , a boutique investment bank that specialized in the media and communications industries . Allen &amp; Co. had put together some of the biggest mergers in Hollywood , and for more than a decade had been hosting an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun Valley for its clients and friends . Herbert Allen , the firm ? s CEO , invited only people he liked , or those with whom he was at least willing to do business . // Thus the conference was always filled with faces both famous and rich : Hollywood producers and stars like Candice Bergen , Tom Hanks , Ron Howard , and Sydney Pollack ; entertainment moguls like Barry Diller , Rupert Murdoch , Robert Iger , and Michael Eisner ; socially pedigreed journalists like Tom Brokaw , Diane Sawyer , and Charlie Rose ; and technology titans like Bill Gates , Steve Jobs , and Andy Grove . A pack of reporters lay in wait for them every year outside the Sun Valley Lodge . // The reporters had traveled a day earlier to the Newark , New Jersey , airport or some similar embarkation point to board a commercial flight to Salt Lake City , then raced to Concourse E ? s bullpen to sit amid a crush of people waiting for flights to places like Casper , Wyoming , and Sioux City , Iowa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane for the one-hour bronco ride to Sun Valley . On arrival their plane was directed to the opposite end of the airport next to the tennis-court-size terminal , where they witnessed a crew of tanned young Allen &amp; Co. employees dressed in pastel " SV99 " polo shirts and white shorts welcoming the handful of Allen &amp; Co. guests who were arriving early on commercial flights . These were instantly recognizable among the other passengers : men in Western boots and Paul Stuart shirts with jeans , women wearing goatskin-suede jackets and marble-size turquoise beads . The Allen staff had memorized the newcomers ? faces from photographs supplied in advance . They hugged people they had gotten to know in years past as if they were old friends , whisked away all the guests ? bags , and led their charges off to the SUVs lined up steps away in the parking lot . // The reporters went to the rental-car desk , then drove to the Lodge , by now acutely conscious of their lowly status . For the next few days , many areas of Sun Valley would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes by closed doors , omnipresent security , hanging flower baskets , and large potted plants . The reporters would lurk around the fringes , excluded from the interesting things going on inside , noses pressed against the bushes . 1 Ever since Disney ? s Michael Eisner and Capital Cities/ABC ? s Tom Murphy had dreamed up a deal to merge their companies at Sun Valley ? 95 ( the way the conference was often referred to-as if it had engulfed the entire resort , which , in a way , it had ) , the press coverage had grown until it took on the artificially giddy atmosphere of a business version of Cannes . The mergers that splintered off from Sun Valley , however , were only occasional calves from an iceberg . Sun Valley was about more than making deals , though the deals garnered most of the press . Every year the rumors sizzled that this company or that was working on a deal at the mysterious conclave in the Idaho mountains . Thus , as the SUVs rolled one by one into the porte cochere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inside . When someone newsworthy arrived , they chased their prey into the lodge , brandishing cameras and microphones . // The press quickly recognized Warren Buffett as he stepped out of his SUV . " The DNA of the conference had him built into it , " said his friend Don Keough , chairman of Allen &amp; Co. 2 Most of the press people liked Buffett , who went out of his way not to be disliked by anyone . He also intrigued them . His public image was that of a simple man , and he seemed genuine . Yet he lived a complicated life . He owned five homes but occupied only two of them . Somehow he had wound up having , in effect , two wives . He spoke in homely aphorisms with a kindly twinkle in his eye and had a notably loyal group of friends , yet along the way he had earned a reputation as a tough , even icy dealmaker . He seemed to shun publicity yet managed to attract more of it than almost any other businessman on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often attended celebrity events , and had many famous friends , yet said that he preferred Omaha , hamburgers , and thrift . He spoke of his success as being based on a few simple investing ideas and tap-dancing to work with enthusiasm every day , but if that was so , why had nobody else been able to replicate it ? // Buffett , as always , gave the photographers a willing wave and a grandfatherly smile as he walked by . They captured him on film , then began peering at the next car . // The Buffetts drove around to their French-country-style condominium , one of the coveted Wildflower group next to the pool and tennis courts , where Herbert Allen housed his VIPs . Inside , the usual loot awaited them : a pile of Allen &amp; Co . SV99 logo jackets , baseball caps , zip fleeces , polo shirts-every year a different color-and a zippered notebook . Despite his fortune of more than $30 billion-enough to buy a thousand of those G-IVs parked out at the airport-Buffett liked few things more than getting a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look carefully through this year ? s swag . Of even more interest to him , however , was the personal note that Herbert Allen sent to each guest-and the perfectly organized conference notebook that explained what Sun Valley had in store for him this year . // Timed to the second , organized to the hilt , crisp as Herbert Allen ? s French cuffs , Buffett ? s schedule was laid out hour by hour , day by day . The notebook spelled out the conference speakers and topics-until now a closely guarded secret-and the luncheons and dinners that he would attend . Unlike the other guests , Buffett knew much of this in advance , but he still wanted to see what the notebook had to say . // Herbert Allen , the so-called " Lord of Sun Valley " and the conference ? s quiet choreographer , set the tone of casual luxury that pervaded the event . People always cited him for high principles , brilliance , good advice , and generosity . " You ? d like to die with the respect of somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being disinvited to the conference , those who voiced any criticism rarely went beyond vague hints that Herbert was " unusual , " restless , impatient , and possessed of an oversize personality . Standing in the shadow of his tall , wiry frame , one had to strain to keep up with the words that crackled forth like machine-gun fire . He barked questions , then cut off respondents mid-sentence , lest they waste a second of his time . He specialized in saying the unsayable . " Ultimately Wall Street will be eliminated , " he once told a reporter , although he ran a Wall Street bank . He referred to his competitors as " hot-dog vendors . " 4 // Allen kept his firm small , and his bankers staked their own money on their deals . This unconventional approach made the firm a partner rather than a mere servant to its clients , who were the elite of Hollywood and the media world . Thus , when he played host , his guests felt privileged , rather than like captives pitched by salesmen at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year built around each guest ? s personal network of relationships- which the firm understood-and the new people that Allen ? s majordomos felt each should meet . Unspoken hierarchies dictated the distances of the guests ? condominiums from the Inn ( where meetings were held ) , which meals the guests were invited to attend , and with whom they would be seated . // Buffett ? s friend Tom Murphy referred to this kind of event as " elephantbumping . " " Anytime a bunch of big shots get together , " says Buffett , " you can get people to come , because it reassures them if they ? re at an elephant-bumping that they ? re an elephant too . " 5 // Sun Valley was always very reassuring , because unlike most elephant bumps , one could not buy one ? s way in . The result was a sort of faux democracy of the elite . Part of the thrill of coming was to see who was not invited , and , more thrilling still , who was disinvited . Yet within their stratum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostered conviviality through lavish entertainment , beginning on the first evening , when the guests donned Western gear , climbed into old-fashioned horse-drawn wagons , and followed cowboys up a winding trail past a natural stone spire onto Trail Creek Cabin meadow . There , Herbert Allen or one of his two sons greeted the guests as the sun began to set . Cowboys entertained the children with rope tricks near a large white tent bedecked with urns of scarlet petunias and blue sage , while the Sun Valley old guard reunited and welcomed new guests as they stood side by side in line , plate in hand , for a buffet of steaks and salmon . The Buffetts usually ended the evening sitting with friends around the bonfire beneath the star-dappled western sky . // The frolicking continued on Wednesday afternoon with an optional and very mild white-water paddle down the Salmon River . On this trip relationships blossomed , for Allen &amp; Co. orchestrated who sat where on the bus to the embarkation point as well as on the rafts . The river guides steered through the mountain valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliances . Spotters hired from the local population and ambulances lined the route in case someone tumbled into the freezing water . The guests were handed warm towels as soon as they put down their paddles and stepped out of the rafts , then served plates of barbecue. // Those not rafting could be found fly-fishing , horseback riding , shooting trap and skeet , mountain biking , playing bridge , learning to knit , studying nature photography , playing Frisbee with the ubiquitous canine conference guests , ice-skating on the outdoor rink , playing tennis on perfect clay courts , lounging at the pool , or golfing on immaculate greens , where they rode in carts stuffed full of Allen &amp; Co. sunscreen , snacks , and bug spray . 6 All the entertainment flowed quietly , seamlessly , whatever was needed appearing unasked , supplied by a seemingly inexhaustible staff of almost-invisible yet ever-present Allenites in SV99 polo shirts . // It was the babysitters , however , a hundred-some good-looking , mostly blond , deeply tanned teenagers in these same polo shirts and matching Allen &amp; Co. backpacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the parents and grandparents played , the sitters saw to it that each Joshua and Brittany was accompanied by his or her own playmate for whatever activity they chose-a tennis clinic , soccer , bicycling , kickball , a wagon ride , a horse show , ice-skating , relay races , rafting , fishing , an art project , or pizza and ice cream . Each babysitter was personally selected to ensure that every child always had such a wonderful time that they would beg to come back year after year-while at the same time delighting their parents with occasional glimpses of the very , very attractive young person who was allowing them to spend days of guilt-free time with other adults . // Buffett had always been one of the most appreciative of Allen ? s beneficiaries . He loved Sun Valley as a family vacation , for left to his own devices at a mountain resort with his grandchildren , he would have been at a complete loss for what to do . He had no interest in outdoor activities other than golf . He never went skeet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison of sorts , " and would rather go around handcuffed than ride on a raft . Instead , he slipped comfortably into the center of the elephant herd . He played a little golf and bridge , including a standing golf game with Jack Valenti , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , for a dollar bet , and a bridge game with Meredith Brokaw , and otherwise spent his time socializing with people like Playboy CEO Christie Hefner and computer hardware CEO Michael Dell . // Often , however , he disappeared for long periods into his condo overlooking the golf course , where he read and watched business news in the living room seated next to an enormous stone fireplace . 7 He barely noticed the view of pine-covered Baldy , the mountain outside his window , or the bank of blossoms like a Persian palace rug : pastel lupines and sapphire delphiniums towering over poppies and Indian paintbrush , crisp blue salvia and veronica nestled among the stonecrop and hens-and-chicks . " The scenery is there , I guess , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 8 He liked being with his closest friends : Kay Graham and her son Don ; Bill and Melinda Gates ; Mickie and Don Keough ; Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg ; Andy Grove and his wife , Eva . // But above all , for Buffett , Sun Valley was about reuniting with his whole family during one of the rare times most of the family spent together . " He likes us all being in the same house , " says his daughter , Susie Buffett Jr . She lived in Omaha ; her younger brother , Howie , and his wife , Devon-missing this year-lived in Decatur , Illinois ; while their younger sibling , Peter , and his wife , Jennifer , lived in Milwaukee . // Buffett ? s wife of forty-seven years , Susan , who lived apart from him , had flown in to meet them from her home in San Francisco . And Astrid Menks , his companion for more than twenty years , remained at their home in Omaha . // On Friday night , Warren donned a Hawaiian shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tennis courts next to their condo . Most of the guests knew and liked Susie . Always the star of the Pool Party , she sang old-fashioned standards by the light of tiki torches in front of the illuminated Olympic pool . // This year , as the cocktails and camaraderie flowed , the babble of a barely comprehensible new language-B2B , B2C , banner ads , bandwidth , broadband- competed with the sounds of Al Oehrle ? s band . All week long a vague sense of unease had drifted through the lunches and dinners and cocktails like a silent fog amid the handshakes , kisses , and hugs . A new group of recently minted technology executives , filled with an unusual swagger , introduced themselves to people who had never heard of them a year before . 9 Some displayed a hubris that was at odds with Sun Valley ? s usual atmosphere , where a determined informality reigned and Herbert Allen enforced a sort of unwritten rule against pomposity , on penalty of banishment . // The cloud of arrogance hung heaviest over the presentations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high government officials , and other people of note gave talks unlike those they delivered anywhere else , because hardly a word of what was said was ever whispered beyond the flower boxes hanging by the doors of the Sun Valley Inn . Reporters were banned , and the celebrity journalists and the media barons who owned the television networks and newspapers sat in the audience but honored a code of silence . Thus freed to perform only for their peers , the speakers said important and often true things that could never be articulated in front of the press because they were too blunt , too nuanced , too alarming , too easily satirized , or too likely to be misinterpreted . The workaday journalists lurked outside , hoping for crumbs that were rarely thrown . // This year the new moguls of the Internet had been strutting , showing off their soaring expectations , trumpeting their latest mergers and looking to raise cash from the money managers sitting in the audience . The money people , who stewarded other people ? s pensions and savings , together commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a trillion dollars . 10 With a trillion dollars in 1999 , you could pay the income tax of every single individual in the United States . You could give a brand-new Bentley automobile to every household in more than nine states . 11 You could buy every single piece of real estate in Chicago , New York City , and Los Angeles-combined . Some of the companies making presentations needed that money , and they wanted this audience to give it to them . // Early in the week , Tom Brokaw ? s panel , called " The Internet and Our Lives , " had drum-majored a procession of presentations about how the Internet would reshape the communications business . Priceline ? s Jay Walker took the audience through a dizzying vision of the Internet that compared the information superhighway to the advent of the railroad in 1869 . One after another , executives laid out the glittering prospects for their companies , filling the room with the intoxicating vapor of a future unlimited by storage space and geography , so slick and visionary that while some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were reminded of snake-oil salesmen . The folks who ran technology companies saw themselves as Promethean geniuses bringing fire to lesser mortals . Other businesses that grubbed in the ashes to make the dull necessities of life-auto parts , lawn furniture-were now of interest mostly for how much technology they could buy . Some Internet stocks traded at infinite multiples of their nonexistent earnings , while " real companies " that made real things had declined in value . As technology stocks overtook the " old economy , " the Dow Jones Industrial Average 32 had burst through the once-distant 10,000-point barrier only four months before , doubling in less than three and a half years . // Many of the recently enriched congregated between speeches at a cordoned-off dining terrace by the Duck Pond , where a pair of captive swans paddled around a pool . There , any guest-but not a reporter-could edge through the masses of people in khaki pants and cashmere cable sweaters to ask a question of Bill Gates or Andy Grove . Meanwhile , the journalists chased after the Internet moguls as they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflated self-importance that permeated Sun Valley this year . // Some of the new Internet czars spent Friday afternoon lobbying Herbert Allen to get them into celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz ? s Saturday afternoon shoot of the Media All-Star Team for Vanity Fair . They felt they had been invited to Sun Valley because they were the people of the moment , and they had trouble believing that Leibovitz had made her own choices about who to photograph . Why , for example , would she include Buffett ? His role in media had come mostly secondhand-through board memberships , a large network of personal influence , and a history of media investments large and small . Besides , he was old media . They found it hard to believe that his face in a photograph still sold magazines . // These would-be all-stars felt slighted because they knew perfectly well that the balance in media had shifted toward the Internet . That was so even though Herbert Allen himself thought the " new paradigm " for valuing technology and media stocks-based on clicks and eyeballs and projections of far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold hard cash-was bunk . " New paradigm , " he sniffed . " It ? s like new sex . There just isn ? t any such thing . " 12 // The next morning , Buffett , emblem of the old paradigm , rose early , for he would be the closing speaker of the year . Invariably , he turned down requests to speak at conferences sponsored by other companies , but when Herbert Allen asked him to speak at Sun Valley , he always said yes . 13 The Saturday morning closing talk was the keynote event of the conference , so instead of heading straight to the golf course or grabbing a fishing rod , almost everyone went to the breakfast buffet at the Sun Valley Inn , then settled into a seat . Today Buffett would be talking about the stock market . // In private , he had been critical of the gunslinging , promoter-driven market that had sent technology stocks galloping toward delirious heights all year . The stock of his company , Berkshire Hathaway , languished in their dust , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the criticism had no influence on how he invested , and to date , the only statement he had made in public was that he never made market predictions . So his decision to get up at the podium in Sun Valley and do just that was unprecedented . Perhaps it was the times . Buffett had a firm conviction and an overwhelming urge to preach . 14 // He had spent weeks preparing for this speech . He understood that the market was not just people trading stocks as though they were chips in a casino . The chips represented businesses . Buffett thought about the total value of the chips . What were they worth ? Next he reviewed history , pulling from an exhaustive mental file . This was not the first time that world-changing new technologies had come along and shaken up the stock market . Business history was replete with new technologies-railroads , telegraph , telephone , automobiles , airplanes , television : all revolutionary ways to connect things faster-but how many had made investors rich ? He was about to explain . // After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buffett had known the Keough family for many years ; they had been neighbors back in Omaha . It was through Clarke ? s father , Don , that Buffett had made the connections that led him to Sun Valley . Don Keough , now chairman of Allen &amp; Co. and former president of Coca-Cola , had met Herbert Allen when he bought Columbia Pictures from Allen &amp; Co. for Coca-Cola in 1982 . Keough and his boss , Coca-Cola ? s CEO , Roberto Goizueta , had been so impressed by Herbert Allen ? s unsalesmanlike approach to selling that they had convinced him to join their board . // Keough , a Sioux City cattleman ? s son and former altar boy , had now technically retired from Coca-Cola but he still lived and breathed the Real Thing , so powerful he was sometimes called the company ? s shadow chief executive . 15 // When the Keoughs were his neighbors in Omaha in the 1950s , Warren had asked Don how he was going to pay for his kids ? college and suggested that he invest $10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six kids through parochial school on $200 a week as a Butter-Nut coffee salesman . " We didn ? t have the money , " his son Clarke now told the audience . " This is part of my family ? s past that we will never forget . " // Buffett joined Clarke at the podium , wearing his favorite Nebraska red sweater over a plaid shirt . He finished the story . 16 // " The Keoughs were wonderful neighbors , " he said . " It ? s true that occasionally Don would mention that , unlike me , he had a job , but the relationship was terrific . // One time my wife , Susie , went over and did the proverbial Midwestern bit of asking to borrow a cup of sugar , and Don ? s wife , Mickie , gave her a whole sack . When I heard about that , I decided to go over to the Keoughs ? that night myself . I said to Don , ? Why don ? t you give me twenty-five thousand dollars for the partnership to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit at that point , and I was rejected . // " I came back sometime later and asked for the ten thousand dollars Clarke referred to and got a similar result . But I wasn ? t proud . So I returned at a later time and asked for five thousand dollars . And at that point , I got rejected again . // " So one night , in the summer of 1962 , I started heading over to the Keough house . I don ? t know whether I would have dropped it to twenty-five hundred dollars or not , but by the time I got to the Keough household , the whole place was dark , silent . There wasn ? t a thing to see . But I knew what was going on . I knew that Don and Mickie were hiding upstairs , so I didn ? t leave . // " I rang that doorbell . I knocked . Nothing happened . But Don and Mickie were upstairs , and it was pitch-black. // " Too dark to read , and too early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were yesterday . That was June twenty-first , 1962. // " Clarke , when were you born ? " // " March twenty-first , 1963. " // " It ? s little things like that that history turns on . So you should be glad they didn ? t give me the ten thousand dollars . " // Having charmed the audience with this little piece of give and take , Buffett turned to the matter at hand . " Now , I ? m going to attempt to multitask today . Herb told me to include a few slides . ? Show you ? re with it , ? he said . When Herb says something , it ? s practically an order in the Buffett household . " Speeding past exactly what comprised " the Buffett household " - for Buffett thought of his household as being like any other family ? s-he launched into a joke about Allen . The secretary to the President of the U.S. rushed into the Oval Office , apologizing for accidentally scheduling two meetings at once . The President had to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused for effect . " ? Send in the Pope , ? said the President . ? At least I only have to kiss his ring. ? // " To all you fellow ring-kissers , I would like to talk today about the stock market , " he said . " I will be talking about pricing stocks , but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year . Valuing is not the same as predicting . // " In the short run , the market is a voting machine . In the long run , it ? s a weighing machine . // " Weight counts eventually . But votes count in the short term . And it ? s a very undemocratic way of voting . Unfortunately , they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualifications , as you ? ve all learned . " // Buffett clicked a button , which illuminated a PowerPoint slide on a huge screen to his right . 17 Bill Gates , sitting in the audience , caught his breath for a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first slide up . 18 // DOW JONES // INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE // December 31 , 1964  --  874.12 // December 31 , 1981  --  875.00 // He walked over to the screen and started explaining . // " During these seventeen years , the size of the economy grew fivefold . The sales of the Fortune five hundred companies grew more than fivefold . 33 Yet , during these seventeen years , the stock market went exactly nowhere . " // He backed up a step or two . " What you ? re doing when you invest is deferring consumption and laying money out now to get more money back at a later time . And there are really only two questions . One is how much you ? re going to get back , and the other is when . // " Now , Aesop was not much of a finance major , because he said something like , ? A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. ? But he doesn ? t say when . " Interest rates-the cost of borrowing-Buffett explained , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance as gravity is to physics . As interest rates vary , the value of all financial assets-houses , stocks , bonds-changes , as if the price of birds had fluctuated . " And that ? s why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand . " // In his flat , breathy twang , the words coming so fast that they sometimes ran over one another , Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of the 1990s , which he described as baloney . Profits had grown much less than in that previous period , but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low . // Fewer people wanted cash-the bird in the hand-at such low rates . So investors were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush . Casually , Buffett referred to this as the " greed factor . " // The audience , full of technology gurus who were changing the world while getting rich off the great bull market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam-packed with stocks trading at extravagant valuations . They felt terrific about that . It was a new paradigm , this dawning of the Internet age . Their attitude was that Buffett had no right to call them greedy . Warren-who ? d hoarded his money for years and given very little away , who was so cheap his license plate said " Thrifty , " who spent most of his time thinking about how to make money , who had blown the technology boom and missed the boat-was spitting in their champagne . // Buffett continued . There were only three ways the stock market could keep rising at ten percent or more a year . One was if interest rates fell and remained below historic levels . The second was if the share of the economy that went to investors , as opposed to employees and government and other things , rose above its already historically high level . 19 Or , he said , the economy could start growing faster than normal . 20 He called it " wishful thinking " to use optimistic assumptions like these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole market would flourish . They just believed they could pick the winners from the rest . Swinging his arms like an orchestra conductor , he succeeded in putting up another slide while explaining that , although innovation might lift the world out of poverty , people who invest in innovation historically have not been glad afterward. // " This is half of a page which comes from a list seventy pages long of all the auto companies in the United States . " He waved the complete list in the air . " There were two thousand auto companies : the most important invention , probably , of the first half of the twentieth century . It had an enormous impact on people ? s lives . If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos , you would have said , ? This is the place I must be. ? But of the two thousand companies , as of a few years ago , only three car companies survived . 21 And , at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book value , which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there . So autos had an enormous impact on America , but in the opposite direction on investors . " // He put down the list to shove his hand in his pocket . " Now , sometimes it ? s much easier to figure out the losers . There was , I think , one obvious decision back then . And of course , the thing you should have been doing was shorting horses . " 34 Click . A slide about horses popped up . // U.S. HORSE POPULATION // 1900 - 17 million // 1998 - 5 million // " Frankly , I ? m kind of disappointed that the Buffett family was not shorting horses throughout this entire period . There are always losers . " // Members of the audience chuckled , albeit faintly . Their companies might be losing money , but in their hearts beat a conviction that they were winners , supernovas blazing at the cusp of a momentous shift in the heavens . Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Click . Another slide appeared . // " Now the other great invention of the first half of the century was the airplane . In this period from 1919 to 1939 , there were about two hundred companies . Imagine if you could have seen the future of the airline industry back there at Kitty Hawk . You would have seen a world undreamed of . But assume you had the insight , and you saw all of these people wishing to fly and to visit their relatives or run away from their relatives or whatever you do in an airplane , and you decided this was the place to be . // " As of a couple of years ago , there had been zero money made from the aggregate of all stock investments in the airline industry in history . // " So I submit to you : I really like to think that if I had been down there at Kitty Hawk , I would have been farsighted enough and public-spirited enough to have shot Orville down . I owed it to future capitalists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these musty old examples . But out of respect , they let Buffett get on with it . // Now he was talking about their businesses . " It ? s wonderful to promote new industries , because they are very promotable . It ? s very hard to promote investment in a mundane product . It ? s much easier to promote an esoteric product , even particularly one with losses , because there ? s no quantitative guideline . " This was goring the audience directly , where it hurt . " But people will keep coming back to invest , you know . It reminds me a little of that story of the oil prospector who died and went to heaven . And St. Peter said , ? Well , I checked you out , and you meet all of the qualifications . But there ? s one problem. ? He said , ? We have some tough zoning laws up here , and we keep all of the oil prospectors over in that pen . And as you can see , it is absolutely chock-full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospector said , ? Do you mind if I just say four words ? ? // " St. Peter said , ? No harm in that. ? // " So the prospector cupped his hands and yells out , ? Oil discovered in hell ! ? // " And of course , the lock comes off the cage and all of the oil prospectors start heading right straight down . // " St. Peter said , ? That ? s a pretty slick trick . So , ? he says , ? go on in , make yourself at home . All the room in the world. ? // " The prospector paused for a minute , then said , ? No , I think I ? ll go along with the rest of the boys . There might be some truth to that rumor after all. ? 23 // " Well , that ? s the way people feel with stocks . It ? s very easy to believe that there ? s some truth to that rumor after all . " // This got a mild laugh for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience caught on to Buffett ? s point , which was that , like the prospectors , they might be mindless enough to follow rumors and drill for oil in hell . // He closed by returning to the proverbial bird in the bush . There was no new paradigm , he said . Ultimately , the value of the stock market could only reflect the output of the economy . // He put up a slide to illustrate how , for several years , the market ? s valuation had outstripped the economy ? s growth by an enormous degree . This meant , Buffett said , that the next seventeen years might not look much better than that long stretch from 1964 to 1981 when the Dow had gone exactly nowhere- that is , unless the market plummeted . " If I had to pick the most probable return over that period , " he said , " it would probably be six percent . " 24 Yet a recent PaineWebber-Gallup poll had shown that investors expected stocks to return thirteen to twenty-two percent . 25 // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gestured at the cartoon of a naked man and woman , taken from a legendary book on the stock market , Where Are the Customers ? Yachts ? 26 " The man said to the woman , ? There are certain things that can not be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures. ? " The audience took his point , which was that people who bought Internet stocks were about to get screwed . They sat in stony silence . Nobody laughed . Nobody chuckled or snickered or guffawed. // Seeming not to notice , Buffett moved back to the podium and told the audience about the goody bag he had brought for them from Berkshire Hathaway . " I just bought a company that sells fractional jets , NetJets , " he said . " I thought about giving each of you a quarter share of a Gulfstream IV . But when I went to the airport , I realized that ? d be a step down for most of you . " At that , they laughed . So , he continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loupe instead , which he said they should use to look at one another ? s wives ? rings-the third wives ? especially . // That hit its mark . The audience laughed and applauded . Then they stopped . A resentful undercurrent was washing through the room . Sermonizing on the stock market ? s excesses at Sun Valley in 1999 was like preaching chastity in a house of ill repute . The speech might rivet the audience to its chairs , but that didn ? t mean that they would go forth and abstain . // Yet some thought they were hearing something important . " This is great ; it ? s the basic tutorial on the stock market , all in one lesson , " thought Gates . 27 The money managers , many of whom were hunting for cheaper stocks , found it comforting and even cathartic. // Buffett waved a book in the air . " This book was the intellectual underpinning of the 1929 stock-market mania . Edgar Lawrence Smith ? s Common Stocks as Long Term Investments proved that stocks always yielded more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most novel of these was the fact that companies retained some of their earnings , which they could reinvest at the same rate of return . That was the plowback-a novel idea in 1924 ! But as my mentor , Ben Graham , always used to say , ? You can get in way more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea , ? because you forget that the good idea has limits . Lord Keynes , in his preface to this book , said , ? There is a danger of expecting the results of the future to be predicted from the past. ? " 28 // He had worked his way back around to the same subject : that one couldn ? t extrapolate from the past few years of accelerating stock prices . " Now , is there anyone I haven ? t insulted ? " 29 He paused . The question was rhetorical ; nobody raised a hand . // " Thank you , " he said , and ended . // " Praise by name , criticize by category " was Buffett ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not off-putting-for he cared a great deal what they thought of him . He had named no culprits , and he assumed they would get over his jokes . His argument was so powerful , almost unassailable , that he thought even those who didn ? t like its message must acknowledge its force . And whatever unease the audience felt was not expressed aloud . He answered questions until the session ended . People began to stand , awarding him an ovation . No matter how they saw it-a masterful exposition on how to think about investing or the last roar of an old lion-the speech was by any standard a tour de force . // Buffett had stayed on top for forty-four years in a business where five years of good performance was a meaningful accomplishment . Still , as the record lengthened , the question always loomed : When would he falter ? Would he declare an end to his reign , or would some seismic shift dethrone him ? Now , it seemed to some , the time had come . It may have taken an invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology as pervasive as the Internet , to topple him , but he ? d apparently overlooked information that was freely available and rejected the reality of the approaching millennium . As they muttered a polite " wonderful speech , Warren , " the young lions prowled , restive . And so , even in the ladies ? room at the break , sarcastic remarks were heard from the Silicon Valley wives . 30 // It was not just that Buffett was wrong , as some felt , but that even if he were eventually proved right-as others suspected he would be-his dour prediction of the investing future contrasted so sharply with Buffett ? s own legendary past . For in his early glory days , stocks were cheap , and Buffett had scooped them up in handfuls , almost alone in noticing the golden apples lying untouched on the path . As the years passed , barriers grew up that made it harder to invest , to get an edge , to figure out what others didn ? t know . So who was Buffett to preach at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that they shouldn ? t make money while they could off this wonderful market ? // Throughout the rest of the lazy afternoon , Herbert Allen ? s guests played one last game of tennis or golf or headed to the Duck Pond Lawn for a leisurely chat . Buffett spent his afternoon with old friends , who congratulated him on his triumph of a speech . He believed he had done a convincing job of swaying the audience . He had not given a speech full of such commanding evidence simply to go on the record . // Buffett , who wanted to be liked , had registered the standing ovation , not the mutterings . But the less flattering version was how many were not convinced . They believed that Buffett was rationalizing having missed the technology boom , and they were startled to see him make such specific predictions , prophecies that surely would turn out to be wrong . Beyond his earshot , the rumbling went on : " Good ol ? Warren . He missed the boat . How could he miss the tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 31 // A few miles away at the River Run Lodge later that evening , with the guests at the closing dinner again arranged according to some invisible plan , Herbert Allen finally spoke , thanking various people and reflecting on the week . Then Susie Buffett took the stage beside the windows that overlooked the pebbly Big Wood River and once again sang the old standards . Later the guests returned to the Sun Valley Lodge terrace , where Olympic skaters axeled and arabesqued in the Saturday night ice show . // By the time fireworks exploded across the sky at evening ? s end , Sun Valley ? 99 had been declared another glorious five-day extravaganza . Yet what most people would remember was not the rafting or the skaters ; it was Buffett ? s talk about the stock market-the first forecast he had made in exactly thirty years . // Notes // Chapter 1 // 1 .
