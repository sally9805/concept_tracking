When Richard Bruce Cheney was a student at Natrona County High School in Casper , Wyo. , he was a solid football player , senior-class president and an above-average student . But he was n't the star . That distinction belonged to Lynne Vincent , Cheney 's girlfriend and future wife . A straight-A scholar , Lynne was elected Mustang Queen , the equivalent of most popular girl . She was also a state-champion baton twirler , a big deal in 1950s Wyoming . To begin her routine , Lynne would set both ends of a baton on fire and throw it in the air while her boyfriend stood inconspicuously off to the side holding a coffee can filled with water . When Lynne was finished with her pyrotechnic act , she would pass her flaming baton to Cheney , who , while the audience applauded and Lynne curtsied , would quietly douse the fires by sticking each end of the baton in the coffee can . <P> Inconspicuous , off to the side , backing up a flashier partner , putting out fires when called upon  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Throughout his remarkable career  --  White House chief of staff to Gerald Ford , six-term Congressman , Secretary of Defense to the first President Bush and Vice President to the second  --  Cheney 's success has derived from his unparalleled skill at serving as the discreet , effective , loyal adviser to higher-profile leaders . He did once flirt with the idea of twirling the flaming baton himself , considering a 1996 run for President . But the idea of putting himself on that stage  --  selling himself in sound bites , baring his soul to profile writers and talk-show hosts  --  would have required a rewiring of Cheney 's political DNA . Instead he took an offer in business , figuring he would retire in the job and then do a lot of hunting and fishing . But George W. Bush had a different plan , one that returned Cheney to the role he plays best . As Lynne Cheney told Time , her husband " never thought that this would be his job . But if you look back over his whole career , it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Cheney seems the antithesis of flamboyance . Stout , gray and slightly stooped , his speech measured and monotonous , he comes across as someone who would shun risks . And yet there are stories . There is Cheney the teenager in Wyoming , attaching a rope to the hood of a car and taking turns with his friends water skiing down irrigation canals that ran parallel to roads outside Casper . There is Congressman Cheney in 1983 , five years after his first heart attack and a year before his second , catapulting down a treacherous ski slope in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , his red scarf flapping in the breeze behind him , as his fellow skiers watched in stunned admiration from the top of the mountain . " That was the real Dick Cheney . He 's not this quiet , laid-back guy , " says a politician who has served and vacationed with him . " Inside , this is a guy who takes risks and is very aggressive . " <P> So it is with Cheney 's views on national security and foreign policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is better for the U.S. to act , even if it means taking the risk of acting alone , than it is to sit still . " It 's not ideological with him . It 's about leadership , " says a senior adviser to Cheney . " If he has a bias , it 's a bias for action . "
