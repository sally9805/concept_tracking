The Foundling <p> <p> <p> Rik put down his feeder and jumped to his feet . He was trembling so hard he had to lean against the bare milk- white wall . <p> <p> He shouted , " I remember ! " <p> <p> They looked at him and the gritty mumble of men at lunch died somewhat . Eyes met his out of faces indifferently clean and indifferently shaven , glistening and white in the imperfect wall illumination . The eyes reflected no great interest , merely the reflex attention enforced by any sudden and unexpected cry . <p> <p> Rik cried again , " I remember my job . I had a job ! " <p> <p> Someone called , " Shoddop ! " and someone else yelled , " Siddown ! " <p> <p> The faces turned away , the mumble rose again . Rik stared blankly along the table . He heard the remark , " Crazy Rik , " and a shrug of shoulders . He saw a finger spiral at a man 's temple . It all meant nothing to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat down . Again he clutched his feeder , a spoon-like affair , with sharp edges and little tines projecting from the front curve of the bowl , which could therefore with equal clumsiness cut , scoop and impale . It was enough for a mill-worker . He turned it over and stared without seeing at his number on the back of the handle . He did n't have to see it . He knew it by heart . All the others had registration numbers , just as he had , but the others had names also . He did n't . They called him Rik because it meant something like " moron " in the slang of the kyrt mills . And often enough they called him " Crazy Rik . " <p> <p> But perhaps he would be remembering more and more now . This was the first time since he had come to the mill that he had remembered anything at all from before the beginning . If he thought hard ! If he thought with all his mind ! <p> <p> All at once he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a sudden gesture , he thrust his feeder into the jellied briquet of meat and vegetables before him , pushed the food away , and buried his eyes in the heels of his palms . His fingers thrust and clutched at his hair and painstakingly he tried to follow his mind into the pitch from which it had extracted a single item  --  one muddy , undecipherable item . <p> <p> Then he burst into tears , just as the clanging bell announced the end of his lunch shift . <p> <p> Valona March fell in beside him when he left the mill that evening . He was scarcely conscious of her at first , at least as an individual . It was only that he heard his footsteps matched . He stopped and looked at her . Her hair was something between blonde and brown . She wore it in two thick plaits that she clamped together with little magnetized green- stoned pins . They were very cheap pins and had a faded look about them . She wore the simple cotton dress which was all that was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an open , sleeveless shirt and cotton slacks . <p> <p> She said , " I heard something went wrong lunchtime . " <p> <p> She spoke in the sharp , peasant accents one would expect . Rik 's own language was full of flat vowels and had a nasal touch . They laughed at him because of it and imitated his way of speaking , but Valona would tell him that that was only their own ignorance . <p> <p> Rik mumbled , " Nothing 's wrong , Lona . " <p> <p> She persisted . " I heard you said you remembered something . Is that right , Rik ? " <p> <p> She called him Rik too . There was n't anything else to call him . He could n't remember his real name . He had tried desperately enough . Valona had tried with him . One day she had obtained a torn city directory somehow and had read all the first names to him . None had seemed more familiar than any other . <p> <p> He looked her full in the face and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> <p> Valona frowned . Her round , broad face with its flat , high cheekbones was troubled . " I do n't think you can . It would n't be right . " <p> <p> " I 've got to find out more about myself . " <p> <p> Valona licked her lips . " I do n't think you should . " <p> <p> Rik turned away . He knew her concern to be sincere . She had obtained the mill job for him in the first place . He had had no experience with mill machinery . Or perhaps he had , but just did n't remember . In any case , Lona had insisted that he was too small for manual labor and they had agreed to give him technical training without charge . Before that , in the nightmarish days when he could scarcely make sounds and when he did n't know what food was for , she had watched him and fed him . She had kept him alive . <p> <p> He said , " I 've got to . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " No . I really remember something . I remember what my job was before  --   --  Before ! " <p> <p> He was n't sure he wanted to tell her . He looked away . The warm , pleasant sun was at least two hours above the horizon . The monotonous rows of workers ' cubicles that stretched out and round the mills were tiresome to look at , but Rik knew that as soon as they topped the rise the field would lie before them in all the beauty of crimson and gold . <p> <p> He liked to look at the fields . From the very first the sight had soothed and pleased him . Even before he knew that the colors were crimson and gold , before he knew that there were such things as colors , before he could express his plea sure in anything more than a soft gurgle , the headaches would flicker away faster in the fields . In those days Valona would borrow a diamagnetic scooter and take him out of the village every idle-day . They would skim along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushioned smoothness of the counter- gravity field , until they were miles and miles away from any human habitation and there would be left only the wind against his face , fragrant with the kyrt blossoms . <p> <p> They would sit beside the road then , surrounded by color and scent , and between them share a food briquet , while the sun glowed down upon them until it was time to return again . <p> <p> Rik was stirred by the memory . He said , " Let 's go to the fields , Lona . " <p> <p> " It 's late . " <p> <p> " Please . Just outside town . " <p> <p> She fumbled at the thin money pouch she kept between herself and the soft blue leather belt she wore , the only luxury of dress she allowed herself . <p> <p> Rik caught her arm . " Let 's walk . " <p> <p> They left the highway for the winding , dustless , packed- sand roads half an hour later . There was a heavy silence between them and Valona felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to express her feelings for him , so she had never tried . <p> <p> What if he should leave her ? He was a little fellow , no taller than herself and weighing somewhat less , in fact . He was still like a helpless child in many ways . But before they had turned his mind off he must have been an educated man . A very important educated man . <p> <p> Valona had never had any education besides reading and writing and enough trade- school technology to be able to handle mill machinery , but she knew enough to know that all people were not so limited . There was the Townman , of course , whose great knowledge was so helpful to all of them . Occasionally Squires came on inspection tours . She had never seen them close up but once , on a holiday , she had visited the City and seen a group of incredibly gorgeous creatures at a distance . Occasionally the mill-workers were allowed to listen to what educated people sounded like . They spoke differently , more fluently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more and more as his memory improved . <p> <p> She had been frightened at his first words . They came so suddenly after long whimpering over a headache . They were pronounced queerly . When she tried to correct him he would n't change . <p> <p> Even then she had been afraid that he might remember too much and then leave her . She was only Valona March . They called her Big Lona . She had never married . She never would . A large , big- footed girl with work- reddened hands like herself could never marry . She had never been able to do more than look at the boys with dumb resentment when they ignored her at the idle- day dinner festivals . She was too big to giggle and smirk at them . <p> <p> She would never have a baby to cuddle and hold . The other girls did , one after the other , and she could only crowd about for a quick glimpse of something red and hairless with screwed-up eyes , fists impotently clenched , gummy mouth  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> <p> " When will you have a baby , Lona ? " <p> <p> She could only turn away . <p> <p> But when Rik had come , he was like a baby . He had to be fed and taken care of , brought out into the sun , soothed to sleep when the headaches racked him . <p> <p> The children would run after her , laughing . They would yell , " Lona 's got a boy friend . Big Lona 's got a crazy boy friend . Lona 's boy friend is a rik . " <p> <p> Later on , when Rik could walk by himself ( she had been as proud the day he took his first step as though he were really only one year old , instead of more like thirty- one ) and stepped out , unescorted , into the village streets , they had run about him in rings , yelling their laughter and foolish ridicule in order to see a grown man cover his eyes in fear , and cringe , with nothing but whimpers to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , shouting at them , waving her large fists . <p> <p> Even grown men feared those fists . She had felled her section head with a single wild blow the first day she had brought Rik to work at the mill because of a sniggering indecency concerning them which she overheard . The mill council fined her a week 's pay for that incident , and might have sent her to the City for further trial at the Squire 's court , but for the Townman 's intervention and the plea that there had been provocation . <p> <p> So she wanted to stop Rik 's remembering . She knew she had nothing to offer him ; it was selfish of her to want him to stay mind- blank and helpless forever . It was just that no one had ever before depended upon her so utterly . It was just that she dreaded a return to loneliness . <p> <p> She said , " Are you sure you remember , Rik ? " <p> <p> " Yes . " <p> <p> They stopped there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that surrounded them . The mild , scented evening breeze would soon spring up , and the checkerboard irrigation canals were already beginning to purple . <p> <p> He said , " I can trust my memories as they come back , Lona . You know I can . You did n't teach me to speak , for instance . I remembered the words myself . Did n't I ? Did n't I ? " <p> <p> She said reluctantly , " Yes . " <p> <p> " I even remember the times you took me out into the fields before I could speak . I keep remembering new things all the time . Yesterday I remembered that once you caught a kyrt fly for me . You held it closed in your hands and made me put my eye to the space between your thumbs so that I could see it flash purple and orange in the darkness . I laughed and tried to force my hand between yours to get it , so that it flew away and left me crying after all . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but it 's all very clear to me now . You never told me about that , did you , Lona ? " <p> <p> She shook her head . <p> <p> " But it did happen , did n't it ? I remember the truth , do n't I ? " <p> <p> " Yes , Rik . " <p> <p> " And now I remember something about myself from before . There must have been a before , Lona . " <p> <p> There must have been . She felt the weight on her heart when she thought that . It was a different before , nothing like the now they lived in . It had been on a different world . She knew that because one word he had never remembered was kyrt . She had to teach him the word for the most important object on all the world of Florina . <p> <p> " What is it you remember ? " she asked . <p> <p> At this , Rik 's excitement seemed suddenly to die . He hung back . " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had a job once , and I know what it was . At least , in a way . " <p> <p> " What was it ? " <p> <p> " I analyzed Nothing . " <p> <p> She turned sharply upon him , peering into his eyes . For a moment she put the flat of her hand upon his forehead , until he moved away irritably . She said , " You do n't have a headache again , Rik , have you ? You have n't had one in weeks . " <p> <p> " I 'm all right . Do n't you go bothering me . " <p> <p> Her eyes fell , and he added at once , " I do n't mean that you bother me , Lona . It 's just that I feel fine and I do n't want you to worry . " <p> <p> She brightened . " What does ' analyzed ' mean ? " He knew words she did n't . She felt very humble at the thought of how educated he must once have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it means ' to take apart . ' You know , like we would take apart a sorter to find out why the scanning beam was out of alignment . " <p> <p> " Oh . But , Rik , how can anyone have a job not analyzing anything ? That 's not a job . " <p> <p> " I did n't say I did n't analyze anything . I said I analyzed Nothing . With a capital N. " <p> <p> " Is n't that the same thing ? " It was coming , she thought . She was beginning to sound stupid to him . Soon he would throw her off in disgust . <p> <p> " No , of course not . " He took a deep breath . " I 'm afraid I ca n't explain though . That 's all I remember about that . But it must have been an important job . That 's the way it feels . I could n't have been a criminal . " <p> <p> Valona winced . She should never have told him that . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she warned him , but now she felt that it had really been to keep him bound tighter to herself . <p> <p> It was when he had first begun to speak . It was so sudden it had frightened her . She had n't even dared speak to the Townman about it . The next idle- day she had withdrawn five credits from her life- hoard  --  there would never be a man to claim it as dowry , so that it did n't matter  --  and taken Rik to a City doctor . She had the name and address on a scrap of paper , but even so it took two frightening hours to find her way to the proper building through the huge pillars that held the Upper City up to the sun . <p> <p> She had insisted on watching and the doctor had done all sorts of fearful things with strange instruments . When he put Rik 's head between two metal objects and then made it glow like a kyrt fly in the night , she had jumped to her feet and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out , struggling wildly . <p> <p> Half an hour afterward the doctor came out to her , tall and frowning . She felt uncomfortable with him because he was a Squire , even though he kept an office down in the Lower City , but his eyes were mild , even kind . He was wiping his hands on a little towel , which he tossed into a wastecan , even though it looked perfectly clean to her . <p> <p> He said , " Where did you meet this man ? " <p> <p> She had told him the circumstances cautiously , reducing it to the very barest essentials and leaving out all mention of the Townman and the patrollers . <p> <p> " Then you know nothing about him ? " <p> <p> She shook her head . " Nothing before that . " <p> <p> He said , " This man has been treated with a psychic probe . Do you know what that is ? " <p> <p> At first she had shaken her head again , but then she said in a dry whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor ? " <p> <p> " And to criminals . It is done to change their minds for their own good . It makes their minds healthy , or it changes the parts that make them want to steal and kill . Do you understand ? " <p> <p> She did . She grew brick- red and said , " Rik never stole anything or hurt anybody . " <p> <p> " You call him Rik ? " He seemed amused . " Now look here , how do you know what he did before you met him ? It 's hard to tell from the condition of his mind now . The probing was thorough and brutal . I ca n't say how much of his mind has been permanently removed and how much has been temporarily lost through shock . What I mean is that some of it will come back , like his speaking , as time goes on , but not all of it . He should be kept under observation . " <p> <p> " No , no . He 's got to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor . " <p> <p> He frowned , and then his voice grew milder . " Well , I 'm thinking of you , my girl . Not all the bad may be out of his mind . You would n't want him to hurt you someday . " <p> <p> At that moment a nurse led out Rik . She was making little sounds to quiet him , as one would an infant . Rik put a hand to his head and stared vacantly , until his eyes focused on Valona ; then he held out his hands and cried , feebly , " Lona  --   --  " <p> <p> She sprang to him and put his head on her shoulder , holding him tightly . She said to the doctor , " He would n't hurt me , no matter what . " <p> <p> The doctor said thoughtfully , " His case will have to be reported , of course . I do n't know how he escaped from the authorities in the condition he must have been in . " <p> <p> " Does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm afraid so . " <p> <p> " Please , Doctor , do n't do that . " She wrenched at the handkerchief , in which were the five gleaming pieces of credit- alloy . She said , " You can have it all , Doctor . I 'll take good care of him . He wo n't hurt anyone . " <p> <p> The doctor looked at the pieces in his hand . " You 're a mill-worker , are n't you ? " <p> <p> She nodded . <p> <p> " How much do they pay you a week ? " <p> <p> " Two point eight credits . " <p> <p> He tossed the coins gently , brought them together in his closed palm with a tinkle of metal , then held them out to her . " Take it , girl . There 's no charge . " <p> <p> She accepted them with wonder . " You 're not going to tell anyone , Doctor ? " <p> <p> But he said , " I 'm afraid I have to . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavily , back to the village , clutching Rik to her desperately . <p> <p> The next week on the hypervideo newscast there had been the news of a doctor dying in a gyro- crash during a short failure in one of the local transit power- beams . The name was familiar and in her room that night she compared it with that on the scrap of paper . It was the same . <p> <p> She was sad , because he had been a good man . She had received his name once long before from another worker as a Squire doctor who was good to the mill hands and had saved it for emergencies . And when the emergency had come he had been good to her too . Yet her joy drowned the sorrow . He had not had the time to report Rik . At least , no one ever came to the village to inquire . <p> <p> Later , when Rik 's understanding had grown , she had told him what the doctor had said so that he would stay in the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left her reveries . He said , " Do n't you hear me ? I could n't be a criminal if I had an important job . " " Could n't you have done wrong ? " she began hesitantly . " Even if you were a big man , you might have . Even Squires  --   --  " <p> <p> " I 'm sure I have n't . But do n't you see that I 've got to find out so that others can be sure ? There 's no other way . I 've got to leave the mill and village and find out more about myself . " <p> <p> She felt the panic rise . " Rik ! That would be dangerous . Why should you ? Even if you analyzed Nothing , why is it so important to find out more about it ? " <p> <p> " Because of the other thing I remember . " <p> <p> " What other thing ? " <p> <p> He whispered , " I do n't want to tell you . " <p> <p> " You ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> He seized her arm . " That 's right . You wo n't tell anyone else , will you , Lona ? You 'll just be my spare memory in case I forget . " " Sure , Rik . " Rik looked about him . The world was very beautiful . Valona had once told him that there was a huge shining sign in the Upper City , miles above it even , that said : " Of all the Planets in the Galaxy , Florina is the Most Beautiful . " <p> <p> And as he looked about him he could believe it . <p> <p> He said , " It is a terrible thing to remember , but I always remember correctly , when I do remember . It came this afternoon . " " Yes ? " He was staring at her in horror . " Everybody in the world is going to die . Everybody on Florina . " <p> <p> Excerpted from The Currents of Space by Isaac Asimov .
