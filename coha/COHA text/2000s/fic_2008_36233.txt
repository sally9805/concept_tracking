I am not a cop . <p> Really . <p> I 've just been playing one on television so long that people get a little confused sometimes . It 's understandable . I 've been at this game for a bunch of years , looking at corpses and bruised runaways all over New York and Baltimore , trying to ask the right questions , trying to find the right bad guy . Or girl , if that 's the case . <p> Of course , when I 'm through studying the corpse , somebody yells " Cut , " and the body gets up and joins the rest of us on the way to the catering tent for a lunch break . <p> But it is n't just the general public that gets my role and my life mixed up . Sometimes when I leave the set after a long week 's shoot , I 'll hit the street and hope to catch a cab . A lot of times , a patrol car will pull over instead and offer to take me where I want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Detective ' ? " the cop will say . " Need a lift ? " <p> And hey , I 'm not too proud to take the guys up on it , especially when it 's raining and cabs are hard to find . Sometimes I even do ride-alongs with the NYPD and sit around precinct houses to soak up the atmosphere , learn the vernacular , and get the moves right . <p> So , as a consequence , between the cops who consult on the series , the cops I talk with in my everyday life , and the people I work with who act like cops , I sometimes feel like I 've slipped into some kind of law enforcement twilight zone  --  a place where the role I play and the person I am threaten to overlap . Poor old Rod Serling would be proud of me , though . I think I remember an episode like that from when I was a kid . I loved that show . <p> But I digress . Now , where was I ? Oh , the twilight zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Take that whole thing that happened in Brighton Beach , for instance ... <p> I left the set Friday night in late September to meet a friend for dinner . ( Harlee , my lovely wife , was across the pond at our house in France with our adored dogs Django , a border collie-Beauceron mix , and Bebe , a poodle-fox terrier mix who rescued me in France . My wife is a master gardener who loves to toil in the soil , an interior decorator of supreme taste , and an astounding cook , among many other things for which I am eternally grateful . ) Having some empty time to fill , I figured I might catch up with an old buddy . <p> The guy I was meeting was a soon-to-be former medical examiner , a Russian immigrant named Rudy Markovich . I 'd met him a few years ago when he visited our set as a consultant for a morgue scene . He looked things over and promptly turned to this young director , who thought he was a hotshot , and said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " <p> I liked Rudy immediately . <p> He was rather short and had a squarish physique . Very European-looking . I figured him for his late forties , but his hair had gone totally gray . He wore it short and had bright blue eyes and a contagious smile . After the scene I walked up to him and said , " Zdravstvujtye , " one of the few Russian greetings I knew . I had had to learn them a few years ago for a part in a Commie spy movie that never got filmed . But the phrases stayed with me . I have a very good memory . Some people describe it as photographic , but I prefer the term closet genius , if asked . <p> Rudy was delighted and started rattling off sentences so fast I had to hold up my hands and say , " Whoa . " I explained that I 'd already just about exhausted my entire Russian vocabulary , and he said , " Never mind , I speak five languages . That 's enough for both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I took him over to the tent for a cup of coffee . <p> I got a thumbnail sketch of Rudy 's life . He 'd emigrated from the then Soviet Union as a young doctor and found work cutting open the dead in the Big Apple , then worked his way up in the medical examiner 's office ; he started listing some of the famous cases he 'd handled . In his day , Rudy had autopsied lots of high-profile dead guys for the City of New York . Everybody from politicians to Broadway royalty to business tycoons . His work had helped New York 's finest , for whom I have nothing but respect , crack some really tough cases . As we had coffee that day , he told me some real amusing stories about the good old days , and some even better ones about the bad ones . His depth of knowledge about so many more subjects than medicine made him a great conversationalist . We became fast friends , and I got the impression he was a man on the move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been considered the front-runner to replace the current chief medical examiner . I know he sure helped our actors sound better and made our scenes much more realistic . <p> But apparently some things in his life had recently changed . Rudy had sworn off dead people and announced his resignation two days before that Friday in September . It was effective at month 's end , and he 'd told the reporters he was going into private practice . I guessed that maybe he thought it might be easier when his patients could talk back , but hell , the dead ones could never disagree with a diagnosis or sue him for malpractice . It seemed a strange move to me  --  going from being a towering expert in one field of medicine in the Manhattan ME 's office to possibly starting over as a general practitioner in someplace like a Brighton Beach strip mall . But I figured it was his call to make . <p> Still , I wondered how long his enthusiasm for patient/physician repartee was going to last . I had a sneaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead may not talk , but they do n't lie either . That 's the big plus in having corpses as patients : the dead have no interest in hiding the truth . <p> Rudy called me right after the announcement and asked if we could meet up and talk about a few things . <p> I 'd said sure , and he 'd invited me over for dinner in his neighborhood  --  a little ethnic place called Dimitri 's , where the menus are printedtwice , once in Russian and once in English . It 's a great place for borscht , not to mention fine Ossetra caviar on savory little blini with a dollop of sour cream . Man , I could n't wait . <p> Dimitri Gromyko , the proprietor , grinned broadly at me as I walked in . The place was very , very Russian . Dark walls , scarlet drapes drooping to the floor , subdued lighting , closely spaced tables , and a musical group singing folk songs in the native tongue . He greeted me with " Dobro pozhalovat , Richard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimitri 's bright teeth appeared underneath his bushy mustache . " Rudy is waiting at his usual table . " <p> I walked back past the bar where bottles of fine vodka lined the shelves , past the little stage where the quartet was singing some song that sounded suspiciously like " Back in the USSR , " and through the narrow aisles of tables , each covered with a nice white tablecloth . The place had a savory smell that was all its own . <p> Rudy looked deep in thought . His head jerked suddenly as I sat opposite him , then he nodded . <p> " Belz , good evening . " <p> " You look like a man with a lot on his mind , " I said . He 'd already ordered two glasses of Stolichnaya for us . His was now empty . A waiter came by and filled it up . He looked at me , like he expected me to down it in one shot and get a refill , but I needed something in my stomach first . I 'm not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit on that , " I said . " In the meantime , give me some coffee . " <p> He nodded , set a basket of bread down on the table , and left , taking the bottle of Stoli with him . <p> " And where is your beautiful wife ? " Rudy asked . <p> " Harlee 's in France at the moment , " I said . " I 'm on my own for a few weeks while we wrap up this round of shooting . " <p> " Ah , the television show . It goes well ? " <p> " You tell me . You have n't been watching it ? " <p> " Of course I have . I would n't miss my dearest friend in action . " <p> " Now I know you want something , " I said , grinning , " laying a compliment like that on me before we 've even decided who 's going to pick up the check . " I saw a hint of something in his eyes . A catch , a hesitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyebrows and tried to cover . " No , no , I merely wanted to ask you something . " <p> " Shoot . " <p> His face twitched fractionally , as if my metaphor had slapped him . He recovered quickly . " I know you 're very well schooled in police work , yes ? " <p> I waited for him to continue . <p> " Then you must know quite a bit about police work . " <p> " Yeah , I 've done a few ride-alongs with the cops now and then . Why ? " <p> He compressed his lips , looked at me for a hard five seconds , and said , " I have a somewhat delicate matter for which I may need some police advice . " <p> " Hey , I am not a cop , " I said with a grin . " I only play one on TV . " <p> " I know you have some good friends on the force . " <p> " As I 'm sure you do . How many years did you spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath , but just then our waiter showed up with my coffee and two menus . After he set everything in front of us , he said he 'd be back . <p> " You were saying ... " <p> His head shook , his mouth twisting slightly . " Nothing . It is not important . I had a matter about which I wished to get some advice , but I will tell you about it another time . " <p> I figured it was best to wait until he was ready . Far be it from me to pry into someone else 's problems . Eventually , they seem to always have a way of morphing into your own . <p> " And at the moment , I have something else of much greater import . " Rudy held up two tickets of some kind . I tried to see what they were , but he kept them facedown as he handed me one and said , " Alexi 's fight tomorrow night at the Garden . I know how much you love boxing matches . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alpha-bet organizations that had splintered the boxing game for the past three decades . He 'd been listed as the best of the growing numbers of Eastern European boxers who 'd started their training in old Soviet-era Russia as young teenagers , and then turned pro after the fall and had come to Amer-ica hoping to make the big bucks . Alexi had succeeded . The sports page had recently run a feature on him under the headline " The Russians Are n't Coming , They 're Here . " Not only was he one of the three current champs , he was also recognized by Ring Magazine as the number one heavyweight , which was almost as good as having your name engraved on the official Ring belt . <p> I started to hand the ticket back to him , but he made a little shooing gesture with his fingers . All I could think to say was " Wow . " <p> Rudy grinned . " I have two tickets in the third row . I was hoping you 'd be interested in accompanying me there so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title . " <p> " Even the old KGB could n't stop me . " <p> That one made him grimace . I should have known better . He 'd told me once  --  after we 'd pretty much polished off a bottle of old Stoli by ourselves  --  of his early youth under the Soviets . " It vas all secret police and terror , " he 'd said , his accent growing thicker under the influence of the booze . Tonight , as he sat across from me , his clear blue eyes hinted at his previous life under the oppressors . In his case , Big Brother did a lot more than just watch . " I still have a mistrust of police , even in this country . I remember how I could never bring myself to trust them completely . " He shook his head again . " Power brings corruption , and absolute power ... " <p> " Corrupts absolutely , " I said . <p> " Let us hope , " he said now , " that they do n't try . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If there 's anything I can do  --  " <p> He raised his hand . " You are a good friend , Richard , and that is enough for right now . I need a bit more time to collect my thoughts , perhaps write a few things down to clear my head . We will talk more at the match tomorrow night . " <p> I knew that was all I 'd get out of him on that subject . As friendly as he was , when Rudy did n't want to discuss something , he 'd draw his own Iron Curtain closed , and that was that . Instead , we ate and drank and talked about everything from boxing predictions to political ones . He 'd been following the recent upheavals in his old homeland near Kiev and commented that he was afraid things would one day devolve to the way they used to be . <p> " It ai n't New York , " I said . " That 's for sure . " <p> I saw a sadness flicker across his eyes , so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , figuring I 'd let him decide if and when he wanted to bring up whatever it was that was bothering him . After a lengthy good-bye to Dimitri , we went outside and I waved to the cab he 'd been kind enough to summon for me . All at once a guy popped up and a flash illuminated the night . Luckily , I was still wearing my sunglasses . <p> " You 're Richard Belzer , the TV star , right ? " the guy asked , and snapped another picture . " Who 's your friend ? " <p> " He 's the guy who might do your autopsy if you do n't knock it off with the camera , " I said . <p> " Okay , sorry , man . " He lowered his hands and retreated to a respectful distance , probably pondering the effects of a flash with a zoom lens . <p> " Who is he ? " Rudy asked . " Paparazzi ? " <p> " Probably , " I said , giving the guy my best cold-eyed stare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " I have my car nearby . " <p> " And take you out of your way to Manhattan ? " I shook my head . The cab pulled forward and stopped by the curb . I opened the rear door and saw the guy had his hand on his meter already . Rudy stepped over and gave me a sudden embrace . Once again , very Russian . <p> " Hey , " I said , " you 're not going to try to kiss me , are you ? Like that guy did to Bogey in Casablanca . " Then I kissed him . <p> He laughed and shook his head . " Tomorrow night , then ? At the Garden ? " <p> " I would n't miss it . " As I started to get in , I noticed the lines in his face deepening . " You okay ? " <p> " Yes , fine . " <p> He did n't look fine . Once again he looked like a guy with a lot on his mind . I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that matter you wanted advice about ? When you mention the cops , that does kinda get my attention . " <p> " Sir , " the cabbie said . " I am going to start the meter at this time , please . " <p> Even though I only had one foot inside . You got ta love New York . <p> I felt like telling him not to get his khakis in a knot , and I started to extricate my foot . If Rudy needed to talk , I 'd send this dude scurrying for another fare . But Rudy reached out and laid his palm on my shoulder . <p> " We will discuss it another time , " he said , glancing over at the impudent photographer . " Tomorrow , at the fight . In the street you never know who might be listening . " <p> " Now you 're sounding very Russian , " I said . <p> He started to say something more , then his hand slowly slipped from my shoulder and he looked down . " Good-bye , Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken " Good-bye " for " Good night . " I watched him walk slowly away into the darkness . I got all the way into the cab and gave my address , but just as we pulled away from the curb , a movement caught my eye . I tapped on the screen and told the driver to slow down . <p> Three dark figures struggled in an alleyway , and one of them was Rudy . I yelled for the cabbie to stop and jumped out the door , leaving the driver behind screaming for his fare . <p> One guy had Rudy 's arms pinned behind his back while the other one stood in front , delivering some mean body blows . Their voices were low and guttural , speaking in some foreign tongue I thought sounded like Russian . The puncher turned in the midst of throwing another gut shot , saw me , and pivoted around , throwing it my way instead . I let the punch sail past my face , then smacked his temple with the heel of my hand , using his momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside like a rag doll and reached into his pants pocket . Seconds later a flash of silver glinted with an accompanying snick . <p> A switchblade . It 'd been a long time since I 'd seen one of those . A real one , anyway . <p> He lunged forward with the knife , trying to slash my face . I pivoted and grabbed his hand with both of mine . I pulled the arm forward , down , and then up and back as I stepped inside , shifting my weight . He was bigger than I was , but the momentum was just right , and his feet skidded out from under him as I slammed him down hard , maintaining control of the wrist until I saw the knife skitter to the pavement . <p> As I started to reach for it , I spotted movement out of the corner of my eye . The other guy was up and coming at me . I kicked the blade away from us and whirled around , executing one of the best sidekicks I 'd thrown since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It caught him just where I 'd aimed  --  right in the lower gut area , just below the belt and above the balls . A perfect spot for causing some real gastric disturbances . <p> Something else flashed and I saw Mr. Paparazzi was back , snapping more pictures . I hoped the idiot had had the presence of mind to call 911 first . <p> The thugs saw the flashes too . They struggled to their feet and stumbled off in a half-assed run . <p> I stooped down and plucked the switchblade off the ground just as another damn flash seared my retina . " One more of those , dickhead , and I 'll shove this up your ass , " I said , holding up the knife . That was a mistake , because the guy called my bluff and the flash popped again . <p> " Man , that was awesome , " he said . " You know karate or something ? " <p> " Or something , " I said , turning and helping Rudy to his feet . " Are you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His words came out in shallow gasps . " I am fine , thanks to you . " <p> Another flash . <p> I turned . " Make yourself useful , and go call the cops , will you , butthead ? " <p> " No , " Rudy managed to say . " No police . " <p> " What ? " I said . " Those two guys tried to  --  " <p> " It is not important , " he said , regaining his composure . " Just a couple of muggers . You dealt with them most effectively . " <p> " Rudy  --  " <p> " No , Richard . Please . " He finally managed to straighten himself all the way up , both hands pressing in on his stomach . " I am fine . Thanks to you . " His voice sounded nervous and obviously strained . " I did not know you were so skilled . Was that sambo ? " <p> " A kissing cousin . " Sambo was the Russian martial art combining wrestling moves with joint locks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hybrid combination of kung fu and hapkido , actually . Was that Russian those guys were speaking to you ? " <p> Rudy shook his head . " Ukrainian . " <p> Another flash illuminated the night . I glared at the guy , wondering if he 'd gotten my good side , ' cause he was sure gon na see my bad one in about thirty seconds . I pulled out my cell phone but felt Rudy 's hand on my arm . <p> " Richard , please . Let 's leave . " <p> I nodded and helped him to the still-waiting cab . " We 'll give you a ride to your car , " I said . I looked up and saw the driver with a relieved smile stretched across his swarthy features . <p> " I apologize for not recognizing you sooner , sir , " he said . " You are Mr. Steven Seagal , are you not ? I have seen all of your movies . Very nice disguise , sir . " <p> Marvelous , I thought . But at least he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 by McBelz Enterprises , Inc . <br> Continues ...
