IT WAS BROWNELL 'S misfortune to fall in love with Morana Altissia after she had taken up the Yeunnin style . If it had happened earlier , he might have had an easier time , because in her mid-twenties Morana was a fairly typical joy-seeking Manhattanite . She followed the fashions in such magazines as Not About You and Shock Cut , gentling the more savage looks to suit her face and temperament and achieving an aspect about one-half step ahead of au courant . <p> Her health was sound , almost vulgarly so , and her moderate drug usage had not harmed it . Her job as data analyzer at OrnonCorp she found so simple that she could not be bothered to discover what the company actually produced . She favored such midwatt rock groups as Madness of Crowds and was merely puzzled by hiwatt acts like Electric Crucifix . She was so pretty that her looks had survived the assaults of cosmetic fashions . <p> But all this was before the Yeunnin , and Brownell Lofton was not acquainted with her then . He had probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little interest , the kind of girl you know before you know her . They both frequented in those days a vodka bar called Gut Feeling where she would fit in so well as to be unnoticeable to the restless Lofton . But when she showed up in company with a Yeunner and outfitted in that style , she stood out . She was the first of the Gut Feeling crowd to embrace the look , perhaps the first woman on that side of town to do so . <p> The Yeunnin had been with us then for ten years at least , so it is pointless to describe their sexless impassivity , their lack of interest in occurrence of any sort , the woodenness that became the behavior model for Morana 's set . The costume , if that 's what it was , has not changed , the black tuxedo so tightly fitting it seems glued to them , the cadaverous pallor , the dull eyes . <p> Morana and the Yeunner sat at a conspicuous table near the center of the room where the chalky , roving circlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexions like caked white-wash . Morana must have heard the whispers concerning them in the surrounding obscurity , but she paid no more attention than did the Yeunner , who of course could never attend anything , sitting like an entranced figure whose trance had been purloined , to leave only that familiar and peculiar emptiness that we have yet to grow completely accustomed to . <p> So that when Brownell approached Morana and made some lame , introductory remark , she was able to give him a look so devoid of expression , so emotionless , that she stole his heart away upon the instant . It is not a look that one can achieve without imitating an alien species , specifically the Yeunnin , and the truth is that Morana had not yet perfected it . An observer versed in the fashion might have detected some small spark of humanity in those blue eyes , but Brownell had never before seen an example of the Yeunnin image , and it poked into his viscera like the ferule of an umbrella . <p> He opened his mouth to try again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothingness , so he had to stand there with his mouth hung open while the circlight stopped its playing and stayed on him for a long forty-five seconds , allowing the other clientele to enjoy his embarrassment . He heard their titters but could not move . At last the circlight operator sighted another victim and swept his illumination toward a teenie sitting on the floor with her legs splayed out , drunk on her ass . <p> The spell was broken then and Brownell moved on to the bar , ordered a triple scrimvod , and posted himself where he could survey the table that had trapped him . He inquired of the silver-bearded barkeep and of his stool-mates at the cool bakelite slab , but no one knew Morana and could give no report of the creature who sat there with her . Actually , one or two of the imbibers might very well know her yet not recognize her in this new style . After two more scrimvods - singles this time - Brownell decided that he would investigate , and that he would begin the process the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced that dryly infectious tune " Acrodisiac " and the orgiasts who were still ambulatory stumbled out onto the dance floor and attempted to amuse the onlookers as well as themselves , but it was no contest . As they fumbled about , naked and nearly naked , the circlight rested on Morana 's table and the immobility that reigned supreme there mesmerized every watcher . <p> Brownell knew when he was overmatched and so left the vodclub downcast but not discouraged . He had discovered the love of his life and meant to make her his own . <p> This was not an easy task . When he asked his colleagues at Executon , where he toiled nervously as a junior director , he found that they knew as little as he did . A few facts emerged : The Yeunnin comprised an alien species that had turned up on planet Earth about a decade before this time and had first been noticed in Singapore perhaps but more probably in Munich , where there was now a sizable colony . No one could say from which sector of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their physical makeup was unreadable , impervious to every kind of scanner from X-ray to multiple resonance to infravibe . Their " flesh " could not be described as flesh because they did n't seem to be organic entities . In fact , it was not known whether those spooky tuxedos were clothing or outer tegument of their " organisms . " They responded to no stimuli whatsoever , from simple salutation to Q-switch electroshock . They were humanoid , but whether this shape was inherent or a chosen transformation was unknown . <p> Attempts to study them had been perfunctory , according to the datanet . Brownell received the impression from many scattered and fragmentary reports that the Yeunnin attracted notice without arousing genuine curiosity . No one followed up . Here was a new phenomenon that was taken for granted , exotic but accepted , almost more an aspect of the weather than a feature of the landscape . Where their names - the plural Yeunnin and the singular Yeunner - derived no one could remember , though two commentators suggested a Finnish slang term as root . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat or companion or fellow animal or tourist . They had no motives , so they had arrived for no reason . Here they are : Make of them what you will . <p> Or do n't . <p> Their influence was one of attitude only . To enter into Yeunnin style was no easy process , involving not merely cosmetics and costuming , though these were demanding enough . To fit into one of those narrow , board-like tuxedos made ordinary dieting disciplines seem sybaritic ; to deaden the eyes to total lusterlessness required a long course of self-hypnosis , though of course many Hooyoos cheated by applying a solution of some opium compound . Repeated usage was extremely deleterious and frightened even the most hardened debauchees . Better to undertake the self-disciplinary method . A little training in yoga helped . <p> But once you 'd got the knack you could do Yeunnin with something like ease . Work a full day shift at your job , nibble a Spartan dinner in your apartment , spend an entertaining ninety minutes putting the look together , and you were ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and be seen . <p> And that 's what a night on the town consisted of , for every other activity was off the board . A Yeunnin did not eat , drink , dance , flirt , have sex , or smile . This behavior was imitated by the human fashion disciples to a tittle . A human imitator was often called a " Hooyoo " by the skeptical ; the term was a compound of human ( Hoo ) and Yeunnin ( yoo ) and carried some hint of disdain to which Hooyoos did not react . <p> The Yeunnin walked and sat and stared into ( or out of ) a private universe ; and so did the Hooyoos . An enterprising Hooyoo would attach himself or herself to a Yeunner and remain in company with the creature until bedtime and then stalk off alone . If any of the Hooyoos were virginal , they remained so ; if they were not , they might as well have been . <p> That was the ideal evening out . But sometimes no genuine alien could be found ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair off together and sit , exuding as nihilistic an aura as they could muster . These arrangements were less successful than the human-alien pairing because of the pitfalls of sexual attraction and social competition . It could be moderately funny to watch a couple of Hooyoos trying to out-stolid each other , but if any observers laughed at the spectacle they did so after the evening had wound up and they had gained the privacy of their rooms . <p> Brownell Lofton gathered all these facts and a number of others less germane to his purposes , but he could not think of ways to make them serve . If it was contrary to the fashion code for Morana to acknowledge his presence , if she would not respond , how was he ever going to unburden to her the boundless affection of his heart ? Many of us adore the Elro Vainen painting , Oh Zero Inert , but does it adore us in return ? To love a Yeunner was to love an entity that partook of many of the qualities of an inanimate object ; to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that entity . This situation presented the almost irresistible attraction of the hopeless cause . <p> Was it Victor Hugo who declared that nothing is so interesting as a wall on whose other side something is taking place ? The case of the Hooyoo amends the phrase : Nothing is so attractive as a wall on whose other side you suspect , or hope , that something is taking place . <p> Brownell then studied Yeunnin as carefully as he was able - which meant that he did n't study them thoroughly , only closely enough to register the obvious external details . Some exobiologists have speculated that the species has been able to project into the minds of other races a lack of interest ; it is a kind of protective camouflage such as chameleons and stick insects possess . But exobiologists are notoriously unworldly in their ideas ; even their plausible notions have some tinge of the outre about them that makes them immediately suspect to traditionalists . <p> Brownell 's plan was simple . He would follow Morana 's lead and become a Hooyoo and sit with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gut Feeling . That would be his coming out with Morana and his plan was foolproof . He did n't even have to ask for a date ; he could simply show up and sit without fear of rebuff since neither of the other two parties would react to his presence . All his happiness must come from looking forward to the event and then looking back on it afterward , for while it was taking place he must have no emotion at all . <p> Dissatisfied with the Hooyoo-style tuxedos that had lately been stocked in a few East Village shops , Brownell set out to make his own , choosing a matte , onyx polyfab that seemed to drink in light like a puddle of India ink . He was a handy draftsman and set his tailor to work on the designs he had drawn up . For the old-fashioned patent leather pumps he had to repair to an antique clothing store and then have the footwear remodeled to fit his rather broad feet . <p> That part was easy . The self-discipline needed to acquire even a passable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as soon as he could . <p> Brownell was beset by the fear that another fellow might have thoughts about Morana and had formulated the same plan as his and would make a move before he could . He learned soon enough that the cultivation of incuriosity is not a project that can be rushed . The nifty thing was that the patience required to learn the discipline was in itself a reward ; the course of training brought about two desirable results at once . <p> He applied himself , by the backward method that was necessary , and after three weeks determined that he had mastered detachment sufficient to get him through a Gut Feeling evening with Morana and the Yeunner . He donned that constricting tuxedo and those odd shoes ; he applied the thick white paste to his face , then the kohl-like mascara and the spidery eyelashes , and finally the gummy lip rouge and the cheek powder . He gave himself one last once-over in the floor-length mirror and performed , with a little fumbling , the mental exercise that enabled him to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vodclub , sat at the table with Morana and the alien for four hours , abandoned the premises on the microdot of midnight , and slouched home , shedding his Hooyoo manner little by little , so that by the time he stepped inside his apartment , he was Brownell Lofton once again and jubilant with success . <p> The evening had been perfect . He had not shown interest in anything and had felt only a very little . He had devised a strategy beforehand to bring it off - looking at nothing at all for a long time , then gazing at the Yeunner , gathering strength from the creature , as it were , and then letting his eyes rest upon Morana as she sat there , tuxedo 'd and painted as he was , with her short black hair parted in the middle and greased down flat , as was his , and with blue eyes like two thimblefuls of ocean . There lay a small difference , for Brownell 's eyes were hazel , but it was unimportant . The idea was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal was an impossible one , of course , but he had managed a creditable Hooyoo appearance and assured himself that he could do better with practice . <p> He got plenty of that . Every evening for five weeks the three of them occupied the central table at the Gut . Their presence made the joint even more fashionable than previously , for the look was just then catching on . Brownell was unaware of his status as cynosure at the time but recognized it at a later date and recognized too that these had been the happiest hours of his life . He might have been content to pursue this existence forever . <p> THE LOOK HAD ACHIEVED a fairly wide popularity when the Blossoming stopped it short . You would see corpse-like , painted figures in their stiff tuxedos almost everywhere , but they liked especially to haunt bars and drug dens , the lobbies of seedy hotels , chamber music concerts , small museums dim and obscure , public parks , shabby alleys . They did not go to restaurants , of course , and were rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Yeunnin and Hooyoos in such numbers , to watch them trudging in vacant listlessness the malls and plazas and avenues confirmed the idea that this look was a survival mechanism , a chosen form of protective coloration . Try to imagine their native planet tracing its oval around some distant sun that gave off only a ghostly violet glow and populate it , in the mind 's eye , with whole nations of beings in grave tuxedos and with faces that hinted of both Lugosi 's Diacula and silent film comics like Harry Langdon . The image of a world of Yeunnin is either horrifying or ridiculous . Probably this appearance they maintained was the best approximation of humanity that they could envisage . <p> The Blossoming would seem to bear out this notion even as it wiped out almost completely the fad for taking up as a Hooyoo . The Yeunnin began to burst into flame , one by one , at irregular intervals . A Yeunner would be sitting in perfect dullness at a pornopub table , oblivious to all the smelly sexual activity that surrounded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn into a scarlet fire and engulf the nether body and the upper . A little tinsel dagger of fire would play out of the top of the head like an immaterial unicorn horn and then disappear . <p> The Yeunner would disappear also , after a series of disturbing metamorphoses that took place almost too swiftly to see . Some observers reported serpentine twistings in the midst of the flame while others perceived quick-darting , multicolored rays or spurting fountains of silver light . A large number of people spoke of seeing the transformation as the immediate unfolding of a flower , something like a great fiery orchid or bromeliad . It was these latter comparisons that gave rise to the term Blossoming , but there were other terms too - Aurora , Cannonade , Firestorm , Exhalation , The Sparkling , and so forth . The term Holocaust did not catch on . <p> No damage ensued . This was a different kind of flame than anyone had known before . It was all light and silence ; it gave off no heat and no odor . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage magician 's panache about it , showy but harmless , wonderfully impressive . Whether a Blossoming revealed in its fiery instant the true form of its Yeunner , whether one of those evanescent images that flared so briefly was the creature 's true shape , no one could say . Perhaps the Yeunnin shared no common form as a species ; each individual may have possessed its own singular shape . <p> Some onlookers found the images angelic , others demonic . Some claimed that the silence which accompanied the event was different from normal silence , that it communicated all sorts of things which no kind of sound - not speech nor music nor the burblings of nature - could possibly communicate . And of course these witnesses could not describe what was communicated because every sound , and most especially verbiage , was inadequate to the task . <p> Whatever kind of phenomenon a Blossoming was , however it was accomplished , it was perfect in its effect . The Yeunner that blossomed vanished entirely , whisked out of the local space-time continuum the way the mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed obvious that its Blossoming was not the end of a Yeunner ; it was only a rite of passage , or , more accurately , a means of passage from one state of being to another . This other state was unobservable , unknowable , by any human apparatus ; only the flame could be observed . The life-cycle - or existence-cycle - of the Yeunnin seemed to be in three stages : the Tuxedo , the Blossoming , and the ? Most exobiologists posited an early pre-Tuxedo stage that took place on the home planet and , though such a premise made sense , it could not be proven . <p> But it led to a widely accepted idea about what the aliens were doing here on our world which no other creature with reasoning power would choose for a pleasant interstellar outing . The conditions of our planet , whether meteorological , astronomical , social , mentational , or chemical , must be conducive to the necessary process of Blossoming . We might think of our world as a hothouse where rare orchids come to maturity safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brooder where baby chicks are hatched , but that image is incongruous when set beside the image of the Tuxedo form . <p> These considerations led to a further question . The entity that takes such pains to hide itself - an interstellar journey in disguise to a hospitable brooder planet - must be , in its early stages of existence , a highly vulnerable and highly prized prey animal , though animal is the wrong term . But what kind of predator could include Yeunnin in its diet ? Trying to imagine the kind of predator that could devour a Yeunner , the kind of creature that could desire to do so , produced a sensation compounded of steel-cold fear and crawling nausea . The mind turned quickly away from this speculation . <p> Blossoming was not possible for the human imitator . It was something a Hooyoo simply could not perform . Although there were some few score who went ahead with self-immolation , the results were graceless , brutal , and unsanitary . This kind of self-destruction demanded the intense personal engagement with an idea that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indistinguishable in its appearance and effects from garden-variety suicide immolation , embodying a banality that was the antithesis of a true Hooyoo 's nihilism . <p> Since human beings could not Blossom in a proper manner , the Hooyoo fashion could not long survive among them . There were diehards ; those who had only lately taken up the fad were reluctant to abandon it . The expense and the labor of acquiring the disciplines were not nonchalantly tossed away . But without a climactic Blossoming the whole exercise now seemed pointless . <p> So , though there were diehards who clung to the tuxes and paints and powders , Morana Altissia was not one of them . As soon as the first reports of Blossomings reached her ears , she discarded at once the Yeunnin look and jettisoned the alien attitude . When she did so she felt a certain charge of spirit , as if some part of her vital being that had been held in abeyance was now restored . She was flooded with a bright energy and looked about for some fashion , some new set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The season offered several new styles to choose from . Among some former Hooyoos arose a passion for athletics , with such pastimes as running , boxing , sculling , racquetball and the like which had been regarded as quaint if they were regarded at all ; and the participants roared at them with fierce and sloppy fervor . Sexual activity made a strong comeback , usually in forms so staid , so " normal , " that even the Hooyoos ' grandparents would have recognized them . The restoration of old houses , especially of brownstones , became a favored preoccupation with many . <p> Morana opted for Pioneer Spirit . She made a ritual of burning her tuxedo and consigned her livid cosmetics to a public toxmat irradiator . She invested in gingham and dimity , in denim , in boots of various styles - woodsman , cowgirl , workman , galoshes . Long-sleeved blouses of blue or white with mother-of-pearl buttons hung in her closet , and she usually wore jeans . On particular weekends she affected plaid shirts and fringed buckskin vest and long skirt . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be described by no other word than " cute " and she was not yet prepared to go that far . <p> No more sniffershops for Morana , no more pornopubs , no more vodbars . In fact , the Gut Feeling had closed its doors for seven weeks , then had sprung to life again as Open Range and served , according to the knowledgeable , the juiciest bisonburger in town . When you drank there you drank a Colorado beer called Good Ole Texas . Gone with the Hooyoos was jizzjazz ; now the clientele ( always referred to as " folks " ) danced energetically to bluegrass , western swing , and , on Sunday nights , polkas . <p> What Morana loved best was agriculture . A neighborhood group had leased a squalid vacant lot and was transforming it to a communal garden . This required an immense output of sweaty work and Morana discovered that she liked - or persuaded herself that she liked - to scratch the dust with shiny new tools , to haul off hard iron detritus and chunks of cement block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken nails as badges of honor . She held steadily in her mind 's eye a picture of what she strove so mightily to achieve : a perfect example of an eggplant of smooth , deep , velvety purple , with a beautiful plump teardrop shape , unblemished skin , and a frilly little cap of green , a jaunty note that set off tellingly its Cote du Rhone color and comforting heft . <p> Her enthusiasm for the fashion of Pioneer Spirit was so strong that she took up with Ronald Bakeley , a Municipal Parks and Recreation superintendent who went by the handle of Ranger Dan . She even managed to fall in love with Ranger Dan and this change in her erased for good and all any last vestige of Yeunnin fashion . If she ever remembered her days of alien-inspired indifference she made no reference to it and gave no sign . <p> The case went sadly with Brownell Lof ton . He was a diehard , clinging to his tuxedo and mask of cosmetics in spite of the changes around him . As a Hooyoo he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morana and enjoying the long , pleasurable afterglow in which he went over in his mind every moment of mutual indifference they had shared at their table in the Gut . <p> He loved Morana Altissia ; he could love no one else , ever . But he could love her only in the way of the Hooyoo . The tuxedo and the makeup and the long hours of stunned impassivity were the gestures that expressed his passion , that deepened it , that made it possible . <p> It is true that he had never exchanged a word , nor even a glance with Morana , though he had gazed at her . She did not know his name , had never acknowledged his presence . Possibly she did not know that he existed . But there are some kinds of love that require no response from the chosen object and the Hooyoo kind was surely the most intense of these . It was Hooyoo love that had sustained Brownell and gave him happiness and now defined him completely as what he was in the world . <p> The Yeunnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less exotic , much less improbable , than any bloke who would allow himself to be called Ranger Dan . The world had become a new place and diehards did not fit into it . It no longer contained Morana Altissia - at least , as far as Brownell was concerned - and so he wanted no part of it . He made a conscious decision to cling to the past , to live in the recollection of his happy hours , to inhabit to the best of his abilities his land of lost content . <p> So he chucked his job , collected his parting bonus , made sure of his benefits , and wore the tuxedo as his constant costume twenty-four hours a day . He was able to purchase two dozen of these , at a highly reduced rate , from a Village shop bent on going out of business . Locking his apartment , he headed down to an abandoned warehouse in SoHo where there was a group of about twenty other diehards , both Hooyoo and Yeunnin . <p> It is not really accurate to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they chose to remain in Tuxedo form . They were individual entities that the Blossoming had skipped over . They did not burst into silver flame and writhe and contort and unfold and aspire and flicker and leap and sparkle and vanish . They went on as before with the listless shuffle , the stiffened face , the absence of all affect . They were seeds that had not germinated . <p> Enough of them remained in this stage to form scattered , smallish groups all around the globe . They did not herd together , of course ; they were incapable of seeking out the company of one another . They collected almost accidentally , crowded out of their old haunts as the orgies of gardening , remodeling , and jogging took up more and more space . In New York City they gathered along the riversides and under the rotting bridges and in the narrowest alleyways and in disused shipyards . In these sites they joined the homeless human beings who had always been there , the winos and cokers and foamers and all the others in the noisome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here too the diehard Hooyoos congregated , and contributed to these ramshackle communities a little economic uplift and a measure of comfort , for they constituted here a social class the winos could despise and insult with impunity , indifference being the sole response their gibes and cuffings received . <p> So it was that Brownell Lofton found himself on a cold February morning in an alleyway off the Harlem River , standing by a rusty fire barrel , sharing its heat with another Hooyoo , two shuddering winos , and a Yeunner who did not need the fire and probably could not feel its warmth . But Brownell could feel it and stretched his hands toward it as if by tropism . He was not grateful for it ; his disciplined indifference prevented gratitude . Yet this licking flame warmed his body nonetheless . <p> Let us suppose for a moment that those exobiologists are correct who premise that the Yeunnin 's inherent indifference and their ability to externalize it , to project it into others , is indeed a defense mechanism . They further propose that the predator that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferocious , most nearly invincible nemesis that creation can offer . But in the case of Brownell Lofton the predator was love and the defense against its destructive power had to be imitated from another species , for nothing in a human being has the strength to withstand it . <p> That is one hypothesis , the one the exobiologists find most plausible . But then , they would , would n't they ? It is their business and pleasure to be discovering or inventing extraterrestrial beings . To account for any anomalous phenomenon they look first to the skies . <p> But there is a body of dedicated evolutionists , called the Wilsonians , who reject the whole idea that the Yeunnin are aliens from Planet X or whatever , wherever . These scientists hold that humankind , alone among the species on Earth , has the power unconsciously but purposefully to determine the direction of its biological evolution . And so they see the Yeunnin as representing a further evolutionary stage of the human being . Look at our history , they xirge . Tot up the nearly uncountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of our environmental destruction , see how we have to live our lives squeezed together like larvae in a honeycomb . The emotional machinery can only bear so much suffering before it learns to dispense with all affect , any spontaneous reaction of the tender or bellicose sentiments . Therefore it transforms our physiologies into Yeunnin . <p> And the stage beyond that is not Blossoming but Escape . The Yeunnin form is a chrysalis , the last stage of physicality . When the body combusts , it sets free the spirit which had been hiding away in protective dormancy from the brutality of its physical and historical predicaments . Humankind is on the way to becoming a purely intellectual being - an angel , if you will . The Yeunnin stage is the necessary preparation . <p> As for these new developments in fashion for strength and health and agriculture and so on , they are mere reactionary reversals , temporary and pointless . They show how much we fear embracing our proper destinies , becoming our real selves . Sooner or later , we shall go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is inevitable . <p> But for Brownell Lofton either theory will account . If his spirit has been changed by his adherence to an alien way of feeling ( non-feeling ) , then his love for Morana Altissia must go not only unrequited but unspoken . If he represents the next evolutionary level of human development then he has left her behind and she is as far from him now as if he lived on that conjectural planet X with its violet sun . In this situation too , his passion must remain tacit . <p> But the scenarios are not identical . One may be seen as tragic , the other as being , in the old classical sense , comic , since it points toward a bright future . If the Yeunnin are an alien species , then Brownell must forever pine after Morana who is lost to him as Poe 's Lenore was lost to the poet , she being sadly gone over now to health and light and ordinary happiness . But if the Yeunnin represent an advanced evolutionary stage , then Brownell 's adherence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his Yeunnin development and , finally , his Escape . He shall have left his love for Morana behind as an outmoded element of his discarded mundane existence . Unrequited love shall have aided him in ascending to a higher plane . <p> So , as he stands now with cold-numbed feet and his hands with their emerald-green nails stretched out toward the fire barrel , it is difficult to say whether the gaze that confronts the playing flame is one of achieved indifference or of anticipatory rapture . You and I can not read his expression with any more certainty than the winos and the Yeunnin standing there with him . The look will be the same , but the narratives that produce it will be different . <p> It is the difference between free will and destiny . <p> Author Affiliation
