" Are you sure you feel up to this ? " <p> Jo finished draining the fettuccine and glanced over at her friends . Maggie leaned against the kitchen counter , waiting for an answer to her question . Erika sat at the small bistro-style table , concern drawing her finely arched brows together . Clearly she was waiting , too . <p> Jo smiled , knowing she probably appeared a little tired . " Of course . It 's just pasta , not a five-course meal . Why would n't I feel up to making my friends dinner to celebrate my new place and my new job ? " <p> " Well , I know you said that you were already working long hours . And you 've looked a little ... pale recently , " Maggie said . <p> Jo supposed the reflection that greeted her in the mirror these days was pale , drawn , and fatigued . But she 'd made a huge move , found an apartment , and started a new job in the course of a month . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then gave them another smile . " But I like the work at the community center and I love being in a new city . And being with you two again , of course . " <p> She gave the pasta a final shake , then dumped it into a pasta bowl . She turned to the simmering pot of white wine clam sauce , trying to ignore the wave of nausea as the garlicky scent wafted up to her in a billowing cloud of steam . <p> She had n't been feeling well , and she knew that fact was evident on her face . But she would be fine . That had been her mantra now for the past couple months . And it would be true . She just needed to get her life back in order . She liked order . <p> She busied herself with pouring the creamy sauce over the pasta , then returned to the oven to take out the garlic bread , which , again , did nothing to steady her queasy stomach . <p> " Here we go , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fettuccine and platter of bread on the table . " I know you two always loved this meal when I made it for you back in D.C. " <p> " Mmm , it looks great , " Erika said , staring at the pile of white steaming pasta as if it might turn into a multi-tentacled creature and attack . <p> " It does look good , " Maggie agreed , giving it her own askance stare . " And it smells good , too , " she added , when she realized that Jo was regarding her with skepticism . Maggie 's forced smile still did n't convince Jo , but she accepted the praise and sat down . <p> " Then dig in . " Jo took a sip of her ice water , waiting for her guests to get their servings first . <p> Erika chose a piece of bread , while Maggie took two small helpings of the pasta . They looked at each other as they did so . <p> Not for the first time since moving down to New Orleans , Jo felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . <p> Maggie took a bite of the food , actually more like a nibble . " Mmm , plenty of garlic . " She nodded approvingly , but then her glance flicked back to Erika . Erika 's lips were pressed together as if she was suppressing a chuckle . <p> Jo glanced back and forth between her friends , again feeling as if she 'd been excluded from an inside joke . When she moved here , she 'd expected her relationship with her longtime friends to be as it had always been . But it had changed . <p> Jo supposed it was natural for Maggie and Erika to have a special bond now that they were married to brothers . But sometimes , like now , Jo felt as if Maggie and Erika shared something more , something private . Jo supposed she could n't say much about that . After all , it was n't as if she was n't hiding something from them as well . <p> She pushed that thought away , focusing on scooping up her own portion of the meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what her grandmother had always said ? And her grandmother had been a wise woman , a woman Jo had always trusted , loved , and admired . First things first . <p> And Jo suspected she was being oversensitive about her friends anyway-another side effect of her big move and exhaustion . She just wanted to get her life back in order . She seemed to be a font of mantras and mottos at the moment . <p> And she was very pleased to be back with her friends . She 'd been close to Maggie and Erika since freshmen year in college , and they 'd always been like sisters . Adopted sisters who 'd become so important to her . <p> " Is Vittorio playing with the Impalers tonight ? " Jo asked Erika , feeling the need to steer her thoughts away from places she did n't want to go . And given how smitten her friends were with their new spouses , she felt certain this would be a topic the two women could n't help but discuss . The two new hubbies and their Bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Erika said , nibbling her bread . <p> " He 's playing for me tonight , " Maggie said . " Although I think he 's going to take over playing bass . Dave is talking about leaving . " <p> " That 's good , right ? " Jo said . <p> Erika nodded , setting her bread aside and picking up her fork . " He loves being back , playing with his brother . And I 'm enjoying it , too . I have a hot , sexy musician husband-but mostly it gives me time to work on my art . " <p> " When you 're not down there being a groupie , " Maggie said with a wink . <p> " Like you can talk , " Jo teased . <p> Maggie shrugged . " I never denied that I was Ren 's biggest fan . But do n't forget , I 'm with the band . " <p> " So you are still enjoying playing , too ? " Jo asked , realizing this was actually the first time since she got here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no wonder she looked so exhausted . She 'd not stopped since moving out of her apartment in D.C. <p> " I do . It 's like a dream , " Maggie 's smile was dreamy . " Who could have guessed how things would have changed for us with that first trip here ? " <p> Jo smiled , forcing herself to take a bite of the pasta , the clam sauce slimy on her tongue , the fettuccine turning to paste against the roof of her mouth . <p> There really was n't any way to tell how one event could change the course of your life , Jo thought , but she was working very hard to get her life back in control . No more surprises for her . <p> They all ate silently for a few moments , or rather picked at their food , lost in thought . <p> " So , " Erika asked slowly , poking at the pasta with her fork , " is n't the community center a lot of work compared to your job at Potomac Prep ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really angling at . " Do n't you mean , is n't a job at St. Ann Community Center a big step down from Potomac Prep ? " <p> " That is n't ... " <p> " Yes , it is , " Jo cut Erika off good-naturedly . " And yes , it 's definitely a step down prestige- and money-wise , but it was still the right move for me . " <p> Maggie set down her fork and reached out to capture Jo 's fingers , squeezing them . " Why the change ? " <p> Jo stared at their joined hands . This was the moment to tell them . To admit what had her running from Washington , D.C. , but she could n't . The words would n't come . Almost as if once she admitted it , it would be true . All true . <p> It is true , whether you like it or not . But then she pushed the thought away . <p> She set down her fork , and pushed the plate away from herself . Clearly no one at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her new place , and it was less than a success . So much for just having a normal evening with her two best friends . <p> She hesitated still , trying to get the words to come , but they did n't . Instead she forced a smile . <p> " Is n't it enough that I was feeling left out ? Missing my two best friends ? " <p> Erika moved her plate aside , too , and shifted so she could join her hand to Jo and Maggie 's . " It 's definitely enough . " <p> They stayed like that , her friends ' fingers cool against her skin . A calming coolness that suppressed the nausea that seemed to be just at the back of her throat at all times . <p> Their kind , caring touch did n't hold back the tears that threatened to spill over at having them here . She pulled her hand away to sniff and grab her napkin , using the paper to wipe her eyes . <p> " I guess I really am overtired , " Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erika gave her sympathetic smiles that did n't really help the emotional overload . Jo swiped at her eyes again and swallowed back more tears . <p> " Let 's get out of here , " she said with strained brightness . <p> " Where ? " Erika said , with a surprised laugh . <p> " Let 's go see your boys , " Jo suggested , needing to think about something besides herself for just a few moments . Loud rock and roll and other people seemed like just the thing . <p> " Really ? You feel up to it ? " Maggie asked with such concern that it made Jo pause . She glanced at Erika , seeing the same worry creasing her pale brow . Almost as if they sensed a problem . <p> Ridiculous . <p> " Of course , " Jo said , already rising from her seat . " Do n't you want to go see your boys ? " <p> " If you want to , of course we do , " Erika said also standing . <p> Jo was counting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , he 'd been a resident of the place for all of his existence . The eighth circle to be exact . But the real Hell had nothing on this bar on the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse . <p> Sweat clung to his skin and the all-too-familiar strains of a Kansas song pounded around him , making his head ache . He mindlessly plucked a plastic cup from the tower of them and headed to the beer tap . <p> If this place , or rather the man currently playing keyboards on the stage across the room , was n't the only link he had left to his missing sister , Maksim would n't be here . <p> But he was starting to lose hope . Every night , he waited , expecting that Vittorio , or someone affiliated with Vittorio , would give him another hint , or maybe even the answer to what happened to Ellina . <p> So far , that had n't been the case . Vittorio knew nothing . Maksim was confident about that . He 'd known when he 'd found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ellina 's handwriting that any connection was a long shot . But it was his only tie to anyone , and he kept hoping that someone Vittorio knew would know something , anything . A half human/half demon did n't just disappear . Vittorio was Maksim 's last thread , however , tenuous . He did n't have anywhere else to look . <p> He finished pouring a light beer for a man , who had been bellied up to the bar for hours . As Maksim slid the plastic cup toward the man , it was on the tip of his tongue to tell the barfly that light beer was n't going to make an iota of difference to his enormous girth . Not when he 'd already had nine or ten of them . But instead of sharing that dieting tip , he said , " Put it on your tab ? " <p> The man nodded , but for the first time since he arrived , his attention was on something other than his beer . Maksim followed the man 's stare toward the open doorway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom he recognized immediately . The first two were Ren and Vittorio 's wives . But it was the third woman who caught Maksim 's attention . <p> Maksim had met Jo Burke a few times , although the woman always acted as if she only vaguely remembered him with each introduction . That rankled him . Women did not forget him . Just ask any of the moony-eyed chicks who came here night after night to watch him tend bar . He had as many groupies as the band did . <p> What needled him even more than her indifference was that he was n't even that into mortal women . So where did she get off ignoring him ? It should be vice versa . <p> Mortal woman just did n't know how to get their freak on . Not the way his demon appetites craved . Oh , he would use them for easy entertainment when there was was n't someone better to do . But paranormal paramours were always more interesting . <p> Still for whatever reason , aloof Jo Burke had managed to capture his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in him . And Maksim did so love a challenge . Well , as long as he won in the end . <p> " Hi , Maksim , " Maggie greeted , taking a barstool across from him . Ren 's wife had to be the Pollyanna of the vampire world , but Maksim liked her despite it . <p> Erika was n't as warm . Of course she had good reason . He had been inside her head , a neat little demon trick he had . Not that she knew that , exactly . She just knew she was n't very comfortable around him . But then having someone inside your head did n't exactly make you feel comfortable . Not that it mattered to him whether Erika liked him or not . She did n't have any information about Ellina , which was the only reason he 'd jumped into her mind . <p> Still Erika managed a tight smile and a mumbled hello . But by then , all his interest was focused on the third woman of the group . <p> When had she gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What can I get you ? " His gaze stayed on Jo as he spoke . He breathed in and something about her , something he could n't pinpoint , caused need to fire through his body like jet fuel ignited in his veins . The sensation literally took his breath away . <p> Unnerving , to say the least . <p> Jo 's dark eyes locked with his , her expression steady and remarkably unaffected by him . Again , he was struck by the fact that she did n't seem to react to him in any way . No recognition , no happiness or dislike , nothing . Certainly no highly flammable substances shooting desire through her limbs . <p> " I 'd love a club soda , " she said dropping onto a stool beside her friends . She then turned to watch the band , dismissing him . <p> Maksim only half-heard what the other women ordered , irritated again by Jo 's utter disinterest in him . Disinterest was a novelty , and he was discovering it was not one he particularly cared for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , his glances going back to Jo every now and then . <p> She remained with her back toward him , her attention on the band . What was it about her that drew him ? And damn , did it draw him . Right now , he wanted to just reach over the bar , grab her , pull her over to him , and lick her entire body . <p> Good Lord , he was a demon , not a mindless caveman . <p> " So , when did you get in ? " he asked with casual politeness , forcing himself to keep the caveman out of his behavior . He set down the soda , then leaned forward on the bar , waiting for her to turn around . She did , but still did n't react to him , even with him bringing himself as close to her as he could with the long , wooden bar between them . <p> Instead she nonchalantly lifted her drink and took a lengthy swallow . She moaned with appreciation , the sound low and deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fine wine , her eyes closed , her lashes looking impossibly long and dark against her cheeks . Her lips parted once she 'd swallowed , looking rosy pink and wet with moisture . <p> Maksim 's already reacting body managed to react even more , an erection pressing against the unforgiving material of his jeans . His muscles clenched with pure need . <p> The response maddened him further , especially when she opened her eyes , set down her drink , and regarded him with her usual impassive stare . All bliss disappeared behind a no-nonsense gaze . <p> " I got in last week . " She took another sip of her drink , again closing her eyes with appreciation . <p> For a moment , Maksim did n't understand her words , already forgetting that he 'd asked her a question . Of course that was before his raging hard-on and the fantasies of making her look as blissful as the icy soda did . <p> God , he was actually feeling like he was in competition with a carbonated beverage . Pathetic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Ren , Vittorio , and the rest of the band were off the stage , and Ren had come up and captured his wife around the waist , catching her off guard . <p> " Come outside , " Vittorio said to the women . " We can talk easier without the music . " He gestured toward the speakers now playing recorded Top 40 pop tunes . <p> They all gathered their drinks and headed out to the sidewalk , where they could chat until the band was finished with their break . Jo followed them , not even looking back . <p> Maksim stared after her as she disappeared outside , confused and frustrated . What was it about that woman ? And how was it she did n't seem to notice he existed ? He was no fool . He knew he was attractive to the opposite sex-sometimes the same sex , too , although that kind of " getting his freak on " did n't appeal . The point being he knew he was good looking . He 'd made that a fact when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , a woman who 'd been trying to get his attention all night approached him , blocking his view of the doorway where Jo had just exited . <p> " Hi , " she greeted him with a wide smile and a flip of her long blond hair . " I was wondering what you are doing after you get off work . " <p> He did n't react right away , still mystified by Jo 's lack of reaction . Finally he focused on the woman . She was very pretty , curvy , and soft . And there was no question about the interest clear in her light blue eyes . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
