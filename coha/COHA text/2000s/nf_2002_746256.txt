In recent years , critics of the social studies have complained that instead of studying history , elementary and high school students take other social science courses , sex and health education , or driver training . For example , in 1988 , the Bradley Commission claimed that 15 percent of high school students did not take any American history and 50 percent of the students did not study either world history or western civilization ( Bradley Commission 1988 , 1 ) . <p> Seeking to explain the origin of that supposed shift , many authors concentrate on the period from 1892 to 1937 , arguing that it was during that time that historians split from educators over how to teach elementary and secondary students about the nature of social life . In general , the critics contend that before World War I , historians and educators shared many assumptions and agreed on several conclusions , but that the relationship changed because historians considered the social studies to be propaganda . <p> As their complaints imply , many contemporary critics of the social studies rely on Herbert Kliebard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the direction of the elementary and secondary curriculum . But in his book , Struggle for the American Curriculum , Kliebard ( 1995 ) does not place social studies educators in any one group . Instead , Kliebard lists four groups who , he thinks , fought to control the curriculum from 1893 to 1958 : the humanists , the developmentalists , the social efficiency educators , and the social meliorists . Discussing the authors of the 1916 report of the Committee on the Social Studies , Kliebard places them in the group that he labels " the social efficiency educators . " In a subsequent chapter , when he considers the changes in schools during the Great Depression , Kliebard describes Harold Rugg and similar social studies educators as social meliorists ( Kliebard 1995 , 108-10 , 171-78 ) . <p> Other historians place social studies educators in one category or another . David Warren Saxe traces the development from the 1893 report of the Committee of Ten to the 1916 report of the Committee on the Social Studies . He argues that from 1902 to 1916 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in secondary schools . Those groups included the historians who sought to maintain a traditional history program , the scholars who wanted to remain within the traditional program but revise it , and the educators who sought a complete reformation of history instruction ( Saxe 1991 , 83 ) . <p> Diane Ravitch claims that the battle was between scholars of history and social efficiency educators . According to Ravitch , during the last years of the nineteenth century , a series of committees sponsored by the National Education Association ( NEA ) and by the American Historical Association ( AHA ) recommended that students in elementary and secondary schools take several courses in traditional , narrative , chronological history . She adds that after World War I , educators came to believe that such instruction did not help students learn how to contribute to society . As result , she claims , educators removed classes providing intellectual stimulation , such as history , and substituted instruction offering practical applications , such as community civics ( Ravitch 1985 , 118-29 ) . <p> The problem lies in the metaphor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccurate in the case of the social studies . The groups of scholars do not appear as distinct , and the changes do not appear as clear or as anti-intellectual as Kliebard , Saxe , and Ravitch portray them . Instead , the committee reports that these authors cite to illustrate the shift from history to the social studies reveal like-minded intellectuals who thought in similar patterns . How Did Historians and Educators Want to Teach History ? <p> In December 1892 , a group of seven college professors and three secondary school administrators met in Madison , Wisconsin , to consider the teaching of history , civil government , and political economy in the schools . Charged by the NEA 's Committee of Ten to answer questions about the extent and the nature of such teaching , the members of the Madison Conference wrote that there should be no distinction between the subject matters offered to students headed for college and those for students who planned to go to work . Further , they recommended that all students take eight consecutive years of history courses , four years in elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conference recommended omitting political economy but agreed that material about civil government and economics should be included in history courses ( National Education Association 1894 , 162-63 , 202-03 ) . <p> In 1898 , the AHA 's Committee of Seven released its report about the ways secondary school teachers taught history and its recommendations of what should become appropriate practices . In their final report , the members suggested that students take four years of history courses provided those courses had been designed around good textbooks , were taught by trained instructors , and would encourage the students to compare many different sources of information ( Committee of Seven 1899 , 430 , 476-81 ) . <p> The AHA 's Committee of Eight in 1909 made a similar report about the instruction of history in elementary schools . That committee 's report recommended that children study some form of American history in what were then the eight years of elementary school leading to high school . According to the report , the aim of the instruction was to enable students to understand their society and to participate intelligently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas as geography or economics . Those subjects could be introduced at appropriate times to illustrate the reasons for historical changes . The methods that the report suggested were similar to those of a good storyteller . In that regard , the report urged teachers to elaborate as much on a tale as the students could appreciate , to bring in picturesque details , and to avoid disclosing the ending prematurely ( Committee of Seven 1912 , x-xv ) . <p> The Committee on the Social Studies released its report in 1916 . The members defined the important aims of teaching history as helping students develop a strong and intelligent sense of patriotism and an appreciation of the contributions of other nations toward the advancement of civilization . In explaining how that could be done , the committee 's report quoted James Harvey Robinson ( 1912 ) , who contended that historians should help people understand the problems of the present . Although Robinson did not indicate which problems historians should explore , the committee members decided that teachers should focus instruction on those topics related to the life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee on the Social Studies praised a teacher in a high school of practical arts , who , at the beginning of a lesson about medieval craft guilds , asked the young women in the class to accompany their fathers to their work and find out what the fathers did during the week . In school , each girl found out something about the history of her father 's craft , its problems , and the techniques that the workers used . When the girls reported their findings to the entire class , the oral presentations covered a range of industries , such as printing , construction , and weaving . The students learned the histories of many occupations , and they saw several connections to their lives from past ages and from distant continents ( National Education Association Committee on Social Studies 1916 , 39 , 41 , 43-47 ) . How Significant Are the Differences among the Reports ? <p> In describing those reports , Hazel Hertzberg argues that until 1913 , historians and educators agreed that the aim of instruction in history was to develop the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time of the 1916 report , educators had become enamored of efficiency and demanded immediate practical applications for school subjects . In this case , practical application meant the development the good citizenship among the students ( Hertzberg 1989 , 78-85 ) . <p> Another set of authors , Robert Barr , James Barth , and S. Samuel Shermis , agree with Hertzberg that there was a change in the direction of instruction and that the change came because the composition of the 1916 Committee on the Social Studies differed from the composition of the earlier committees . They argue that the majority of the members of the Committee on the Social Studies were teachers or school administrators , rather than historians . They claim that as a result of the different composition of the committee , the later report contained more practical aims and depended less on textbooks than the other reports ( Barr , Barth , and Shermis 1977 , 19-25 ) . <p> It is not fair to distinguish the committees as being made up of either academics or of educators . Both of the AHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been teachers or school administrators or were familiar with the problems that teachers faced . In fact , the authors of the AHA 's reports took pride in the fact that the findings came from people who understood schools and teachers . <p> It is also not fair to claim that the social studies educators substituted courses in civics or geography for history classes . On the one hand , it is true that during their meeting in 1892 , the members of the Madison Conference recommended that students take at least six history courses . On the other hand , in 1916 , the Committee on the Social Studies substituted a course in civics and another in geography for two history courses . The Madison Conference thought that the material found in civics and political economy courses could be taught in classes labeled history . In addition , the Committee on Social Studies wanted history to appear in classes called geography and civics . Thus , the differences seem to be more in the names of the courses than in their substance . <p> Furthermore , it is not fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history classes in place of social studies classes . In 1916 , Carl Becker , who later became the president of the AHA , argued that history courses as then conceived in elementary schools and high schools were not educative . He claimed that the students emerged from the courses having memorized a few facts and some generalizations that meant little to them . They never learned to think historically . Becker offered several suggestions , such as limiting the study to contemporary history or focusing only on the United States . He concluded it might be best to merge all the so-called social sciences  --  history , economics , civics , and sociology  --  into a carefully coordinated course ( Becker 1966 , 377-78 ) . <p> More important , the committees supposedly dominated by historians and those supposedly dominated by social studies educators recommended similar methods of teaching . For example , in 1892 , the members of the Madison Conference , supposedly dominated by historians , urged teachers to consider the study of topics that required that students find information and make judgments . The committee noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history . According to the Madison Conference , topics could be biographies or issues involving the community . Although the members of the Madison Conference thought topics could be linked together so that the entire course could be taught that way , they cautioned teachers to restrict the size of the topics so that the students could manage the material . In addition , they wanted the students to use printed records as much as possible . In 1899 , the AHA 's Committee of Seven , also supposedly dominated by historians , reinforced the intent of the Madison Conference 's report . That AHA committee , however , cautioned against the sole use of topics in constructing a course . The AHA report noted that texts gave the courses a definite line from which teachers could select topics for the students to study ( National Education Association 1894 , 195-97 ; Committee of Seven 1899 , 476 ) . <p> In 1916 , the members of the Committee on the Social Studies , who supposedly were educators , did not use the phrase , " the topical method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of their fathers ' professions , the Committee on the Social Studies urged something that could be called a topical approach . An important difference might be that the Committee on the Social Studies wanted the topics to come from the students ' present life and interests , whereas the Madison Conference did not make such restrictions . <p> The similarity among the committee reports may have occurred because the historians on those committees sought to reinforce their ideas of the discipline and educators on the committees followed similar ideas in seeking to improve school studies . Among the historians who served on the Madison Conference in 1892 were Albert Bushnell Hart and James Harvey Robinson . Those historians became famous for urging their colleagues to turn their attention from military and political affairs to studies of the social customs of people . For example , from 1900 , Robinson wrote essays and delivered addresses calling for a new history . According to him , the problem was that then prominent historians produced lists of insignificant rulers but overlooked artists who contributed major changes to the culture of a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1916 , the report of the Committee on the Social Studies depended heavily on Robinson 's contributions . <p> Ravitch and her colleagues are correct in noting that once the 1916 report became popular , high school teachers turned the social studies into opportunities to extol patriotism . Nonetheless , it is not fair to cite the presence of classroom exercises aimed at instilling mindless loyalty to criticize the 1916 report . <p> In its 1916 report , the Committee on the Social Studies claimed that social studies offered training in citizenship , but the members defined that as cultivating a sense of membership in the world community with all the sympathies and sense of justice that entailed . In practice , though , narrower loyalties replaced wider humanitarian sympathies . For example , in 1920 , C. O. Davis reported that , after the end of World War I , the public had demanded an increase in what he called " full-blooded Americanism . " Claiming that many native-born Americans lacked a full appreciation of the benefits they enjoyed as citizens , Davis surveyed 1,180 schools from eighteen states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship . Davis found that his respondents regarded citizenship as a form of public spiritedness created by ministers or successful businessmen in large assemblies , a sense of nationalism inculcated through stirring patriotic music , or an emotional zeal inspired by selected oral readings . Most important , contrary to the wishes of the members of the Committee on Social Studies , teachers used textbooks or official leaflets provided by the states , rather than designing materials specifically for the community ( Davis 1920 , 45-59 ) . <p> If elementary and secondary teachers changed the instruction of social studies from requiring students to memorize lists of battles and kings to requiring students to demonstrate patriotism actively , few people would call that progress . Nonetheless , the point remains that the authors of the various reports of historians ' and educators ' committees , which were written from 1892 to 1916 , wanted to avoid both types of mindless activities . How Did the Depression Change Educators ' Views of the Social Studies ? <p> With the stock market crash in 1929 , the educators that Kliebard called social meliorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught about the ways in which society was organized to encourage students to think critically . That process , however , began before the Great Depression . Writing in the yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education in 1923 , Harold Rugg complained that , although the aim of the social studies was to prepare children for life 's activities , the students studied separate subjects , such as history and civics , wherein they memorized such information as the rise and fall of kings , the details of military battles , and the provisions of the Constitution . For Rugg , none of that information shed light on the pressing social conditions of the day ( Rugg 1923 , 2-14 ) . <p> As a result , Rugg suggested two changes . First , he thought that authors should rearrange the materials to be studied in ways that would reproduce life experiences . According to Rugg , an easy way to accomplish that goal was for the textbooks to present the social studies as a continuous series of social problems . Second , in line with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of the social studies should be unified . Thus , students could learn about a topic , such as immigration between 1820 and 1920 , by studying the political development of Germany , the economic changes in England and Ireland , and the historical changes in the status of farming in various countries ( Rugg 1923 , 19-23 ) . <p> Working with a few assistants , Rugg collected existing curriculums , compiled research explaining the abilities of children at different ages , and determined the problems and central trends of contemporary life that children needed to know . Beginning in 1922 , Rugg used that information to write three trial textbooks . In 1927 , after teachers used those experimental offerings and responded with criticisms , Rugg and his assistants wrote and published textbooks , workbooks , and teachers ' guides . By 1940 , he had completed eight volumes for the elementary schools and six for the secondary schools ( Rugg 1941 , 40-47 , 214-20 ) . <p> Although Rugg 's books sold widely , their strength turned out to be their weakness . He had organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical thinking and because he could organize materials from a variety of disciplines in comprehensible and interesting ways . That system , however , allowed critics to complain that the texts showed students that life in America was horrible . As a result , from 1939 to 1940 , right-wing critics complained that Rugg was an un-American traitor . Rugg did not revise his texts in subsequent years ( Rugg 1941 , 71-73 ; Kliebard 1995 , 178 ) . Did Historians Change Their Perspectives during the Depression ? <p> In a fashion similar to the changes that took place among educators , the so-called new historians became more popular as the Depression spread . In 1929 , James Harvey Robinson delivered his presidential address to the AHA . Robinson criticized the historians who had worked during World War I because they concentrated on original documents that described the growth of such institutions as churches , parliaments , or guilds . Although those historians thought they were being objective and scientific , Robinson complained they avoided the contemporary conditions so completely that they could not offer counsel to balance the hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians of his day who sought to understand the daily lives of people and used information from a variety of areas ( Robinson 1930 , 246 , 247 , 249 , 252 ) . <p> Carl Becker made similar criticisms of those he called scientific historians in 1931 , when he delivered his presidential address to the AHA . Becker urged the historians attending the meeting to write stories from which people could derive significant meanings . He added that that meant historians should not try to present objective facts as much as they should help people understand contemporary conditions ( Becker 1932 , 231-35 ) . <p> In 1934 , Charles Beard delivered his presidential address to the AHA . Like Robinson and Becker , Beard criticized the conservative scientific historians . He claimed that those authors presented facts in hopes that such presentations would reveal laws of historical change . Beard claimed that such hopes were misguided . No one could discover such general laws because , in any effort to express those laws , authors injected their philosophic biases . Thus , Beard concluded , historians should recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as they tried to be as objective as they could in their writings ( Beard 1934 , 219-20 , 228-29 ) . <p> Most important to this discussion , Beard wrote in 1932 the statement of objectives for the AHA 's Commission on the Social Studies , Charter for the Social Studies . Although Harold Rugg served on the commission , Beard 's statement did not reinforce Rugg 's concern for the unification of the different disciplines . Instead , Beard claimed that each discipline had a center of its own and , at best , the desire to unify them would lead to the construction of a mosaic rather than to a coalescence of the disciplines . Although Beard acknowledged that students should encounter discussions about social problems , he was unwilling to conclude that a continuous series of problems was the best scheme for a text . He could not determine what problems were most pressing , what answers would be reasonable , nor what the students should learn about those difficulties . Nonetheless , Beard argued that the climate of American ideas held that people could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought . For that reason , he concluded that the aim of the social studies was the creation , within the students , of rich , many-sided personalities ( Beard 1932 , 20-21 , 42-48 , 70-71 , 96-97 ) . <p> Ravitch does not appreciate Beard 's formulation of the aim of the social studies . Despite the fact that the AHA sponsored the Commission on the Social Studies , she claims that the aim of forming rich , many-sided personalities contributed to the denigration of history as a discipline , and she complains that no other group would pursue such a goal ( Ravitch 1985 , 130 ) . <p> In disparaging the ideal of creating many-sided personalities , Ravitch overlooks the way that aim mirrored Beard 's description of written history as an act of faith . When Beard explained what such a personality required , he noted that the students had to become infused with ideals and be equipped with practical knowledge . Beard added that the students had to be informed about world affairs and had to realize that the world could be changed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information the students should learn was the way people acquired biases from their environments . In that way , they learned that they suffered from mistaken judgments . To control the problem of bias , Beard wanted the students to learn how to acquire knowledge by attaining access to authoritative sources , to make judgments by analyzing the information they amassed , and to practice the scientific method ( Beard 1932 , 98-101 ) . <p> When the AHA 's Commission on the Social Studies proposed a curriculum model , it differed considerably from the one that Rugg had designed . In 1936 , Leon Marshall and his daughter , Rachel Marshall Goetz , published the thirteenth part of the report of the Commission on the Social Studies , Curriculum-Making in the Social Studies . Their innovation was simple . They suggested that students learn the ways of living that are common to all societies . Although they acknowledged that experts might differ on what constituted the fundamental human activities , they considered the processes to be adjusting to the external world , continuing biologically , guiding human motivation , developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marshall and Goetz asserted that when textbooks were organized that way , students could organize the facts they learned . The students could apply their own experiences to the lessons , and the processes served as standards with which to measure the social studies curriculum ( Marshall and Goetz 1936 , 2-3 , 7-19 ) . <p> Marshall and Goetz 's approach enjoyed a benefit that Rugg 's did not-the fact that critics could not complain that they portrayed any society in a poor light . The authors could assert that their approach sought the common features shared by all societies . Did Historians Accept the Conclusions of the Commission on the Social Studies ? <p> According to Peter Novick ( 1988,190-92 ) , the AHA did not accept the report of its Commission on the Social Studies . He also noted that the College Entrance Examination Board ( CEEB ) overlooked the social studies and endorsed historical studies that included social , political , and economic studies . Unfortunately , the citation that Novick offers to support his assertion that the AHA rejected the commission 's reports does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues repeat Novick 's claim that historians separated themselves from elementary and secondary school issues ( Nash , Crabtree , and Dunn 1998 , 37-39 ) . <p> Despite Novick 's assertion that CEEB overlooked the social studies , that was not the case . In 1936 , the CEEB 's Commission on History made its report on how the curriculum should be constructed . The CEEB 's commission recommended Marshall and Goetz 's book , Curriculum-Making in the Social Studies . In fact , the authors of the CEEB report followed Marshall and Goetz in their description of the universal social processes when they described how history should be taught ( Commission on History 1936 , 554 ) . <p> When the journal The Social Studies published the CEEB report , the editors criticized the commission for ignoring the problems of the elementary and junior high schools . The editors noted that although the CEEB endorsed Marshall and Goetz 's plan , there were no textbooks written in that fashion . Furthermore , the editors noted the CEEB report did not cite the 1916 Committee on the Social Studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad view of the nature of history and the social studies that corresponded with then current thinking ( Editor 1936 , 567 ) . <p> The CEEB report had its critics . One member of the CEEB commission , Tyler Kepner , refused to sign the report . He claimed that Marshall and Goetz 's model of curriculum making had been available for more than twenty years but had not spread beyond a small minority of teachers . Kepner argued that the commission should not endorse such a method until there was proof that it would lead to better instruction in history ( Commission on History 1936 , 565-66 ) . In addition , the teachers of history at Phillips Exeter Academy submitted a three-page mimeographed memorandum in which they endorsed Kepner 's dissent . The teachers complained that following the social studies approach of Marshall and Goetz would cause them to skim the surface of many subjects . Worse , it would turn the instruction of history into courses in sociology . Instead of trying to demonstrate the process of social life , the teachers thought that students had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asserted knowledge would precede wisdom ( Teachers 1937 , 258 ) . Conclusion <p> Although many historians claim that historians and social studies educators began to go in different directions during World War I and finally spilt apart during the Great Depression , that was not what happened . Social studies educators and historians had more similar aims and methods than such an argument allows . What is fascinating is that the debate between historians and social studies educators continues , despite the similarity of their views . The report of the Bradley Commission in 1988 shows how similar the two sides are , even when one side contends that they are not . <p> When the Bradley Commission complained about students ' taking too many courses in the social studies , they described what they called the six vital themes and narratives that history courses should explore . The list was similar to the list of social processes that Marshall and Goetz recommended in 1936 as the basis of social studies instruction . On the one hand , the Bradley Commission noted that an important theme was civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marshall and Goetz urged teachers to explain the social processes and cultural improvement . The Bradley Commission thought students should learn about patterns of social interaction , and Marshall and Goetz recommended that the teachers describe developing social organization . The Bradley Commission thought students should learn about human interaction with the environment , and Marshall and Goetz thought students should discover how people adjust to the external world ( Bradley Commission 1988 , 10-11 ) . By reviewing the points made by the Bradley Commission and by Marshall and Goetz , one can conclude that the two sides were not that far apart . <p> Key words : defining social studies , historical development of social studies , history vs. social studies <p>
