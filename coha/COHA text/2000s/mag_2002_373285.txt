For almost four decades , Ralph Nader has been the scold of corporate America . Now the man and the moment have merged as America recoils at CEOs ' behaving badly . TIME 's Matthew Cooper spoke to Nader about greed , corruption and why the presidential spoiler wo n't even think about playing golf . <P> DID YOU THINK THERE WAS THIS MUCH CORPORATE CORRUPTION ? <P> No . And is n't it saying something that it exceeded my anticipation ? It is impossible to exaggerate the supermarket of crime . It 's greed on steroids . <P> WHY DID N'T WE KNOW ABOUT IT ALL SOONER ? <P> What amazes me is that there are thousands of people who could have been whistle-blowers , from the boards of directors to corporate insiders to the accounting firms to the lawyers working for these firms to the credit-rating agencies . All these people ! Would a despotic dictatorship have been more efficient in silencing them and producing the perverse incentives for them all to keep quiet ? The system is so efficient that there 's total silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill Gulags . <P> CONGRESS PASSED A CORPORATE-ACCOUNTABILITY ACT LAST WEEK . WAS THAT ENOUGH ? <P> In this bill they ducked the stock-option expensing ; they ducked the past disgorgement , where you have to pay it back and go to jail ; and they ducked corporate governance in any fundamental way . The election of corporate board members is a Kremlin type of election . It 's a self-perpetuating system , with the shareholders having no real power . That has not been touched . And basic problems of conflict of interest have not been dealt with . You have all the watchdogs in the private sector getting commissions from all the people they are supposed to be watching . The companies pay the auditors who are supposed to be auditing . <P> WHICH PARTY IS MORE TO BLAME FOR ALL THIS ? <P> It 's equal-opportunity corruption . It 's campaign cash . And what campaign cash produces is a convergence of culpability . <P> WHAT WOULD HELP ? <P> You need to have a Federal Bureau of Audits to monitor the top 1,000 companies .
