Lulu 's CafT <p> Tuesday , March 18 <p> 12:05 p.m . <p> " I ca n't believe it ! " Felicia Lopez-Morrison waved as she ricocheted through the tables , heading toward her three friends seated in their usual booth in the back right-hand corner of Lulu 's . <p> " Did you hear the news ? " she asked breathlessly , sliding into the seat next to Jennifer , who pushed her leather purse against the wall and scooched over to give Felicia room . <p> Mimi laughed . " You mean about the scandal ? " <p> " Who has n't heard ? " Jennifer leaned over and gave Felicia a sideways hug . <p> " When Dave told me , I thought he was kidding , " Felicia said . " Kitty has n't even been in the ground a year . " <p> Lisa nodded . " Well , Norm was probably just lonely . He needed the companionship . " <p> " Then buy a dog , " Jennifer suggested . " Of course , " she said , getting tickled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living together ! " <p> The other women groaned . <p> " It would have to be for companionship . " Felicia playfully nudged Jennifer in the shoulder . " He just met the woman . He could n't love her , could he ? " <p> " From what I heard , " Mimi said matter-of-factly , " she 's more like a girl . " <p> " Ladies ! " Lisa smiled but looked a little uncomfortable . <p> Jennifer knew Lisa was construing this turn as gossipy . Sweet Lisa , Jennifer thought , looking at her friend , seated across the table from her . Always taking the high road . You 'd think after three years of us all being friends , we would have picked up some of her good traits . <p> " Well , well . " A loud , brassy voice interrupted Jennifer 's thoughts . Their plump , gruff-sounding waitress , Gracie , was standing over their table , pulling out the order pad from the white apron around her ample thighs . " Glad to see little Miss Seora made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense . " Hey , I 'm only five minutes late ! " <p> " Yeah , yeah . " A slight smile crossed Gracie 's face . She jutted her chin out toward Felicia . " I 'm likin ' you without all the high-and-mighty outfits and shoes and whatnot . " <p> Everyone at the table laughed . Felicia spread her arms in show and bowed her head , as if accepting a standing ovation . Gracie threw back her head and guffawed . <p> Felicia certainly had changed in the last year since she 'd been working from home , Jennifer realized . Her silky black hair , once curled and neatly laying across the top of her shoulders , was now pulled back in a ponytail . And her high-powered business suits and designer shoes had been replaced by a pair of black jeans and a mauve hoodie sweater . Jennifer glanced under the table  --  Well , her boots are still designer , she thought good-naturedly . <p> " I like you girls . " Gracie pulled a pencil from behind her ear . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , thank you , Gracie , " Mimi said . " And you 're ours . " <p> " All right , enough with the chitchat , " Gracie said . " Are we all having the regulars ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " Jennifer and the others chimed in . <p> Gracie harrumphed . " I do n't know why I keep taking out my order pad and pen for you all . Okay , PWs , I 'll be back with your drinks . " <p> Jennifer watched Gracie plod off to her next table of customers , several booths toward the front of the cafT . Jennifer really liked their waitress  --  and knew her three friends did , too . Underneath all Gracie 's gruffness lay a heart as big as an ocean . And it was Gracie who had given the women their official group nickname  --  the PWs . <p> When Jennifer , Mimi , Lisa , and Felicia had started secretly meeting at Lulu 's nearly three years before , Gracie had been their waitress . She 'd overheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were all pastors ' wives , and nicknamed them . She 'd gotten a big kick out of the fact that the women  --  all hailing from the southwest Ohio town of Red River  --  would drive forty miles out of their way every other Tuesday to nosh and chat in this little nothing-special dive . Although the PWs never had explained to Gracie that they met that far from home to avoid nosy townsfolk and their church members overhearing their business , their now-seventy-year-old waitress had n't taken too long to figure out what was going on . <p> Now Gracie ambled slowly behind the front counter to the rectangular opening between the restaurant and the kitchen . She pounded a bell sitting on the ledge and yelled , " Order in ! " <p> Felicia unfolded her paper napkin and laid it on her lap . " I just ca n't believe it , " she mused , shaking her head . " Norm Katt remarried . To a woman half his age . " <p> " Whom he just met , " Mimi reminded everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their order ticket and start to read it . Gracie had interrupted a very important news-sharing moment , and Jennifer did n't want to miss any of it . <p> " And did you hear her name ? " Mimi asked . <p> " Allison . " Lisa shook her head , looking as if she were trying to suppress a laugh . " Ally . " <p> As if in a chorus , the women said , " Ally Katt . " <p> " Does the man never learn ? " Felicia laughed . " First , he marries Kitty . And now Ally . " <p> " Oh , if they have children ! " Jennifer said . " They could name one Fraidy . " <p> Felicia nodded . " Twins , of course , would be named Siamese and Tiger . " <p> " Of course . " Jennifer smiled . <p> " You all are so terrible ! " Lisa pushed back her thick , **25;922;TOOLONG hair and fluffed it . <p> Mimi sighed and patted Lisa on the arm . " Oh , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean anything by it , do we , ladies ? But you do have to admit , it is funny . " <p> Lisa rolled her eyes and shook her head as if to say , " You silly kids . " " Has anybody seen her ? " <p> " Not that I know of  --  I mean , except for their church , " Jennifer said . " I guess Norm and his new bride came back to town only a couple weeks ago . " <p> " Well , " Mimi said , " that kid 's got a tough act to follow . As much as Kitty drove us all crazy , her church adored her . Wonder how they 'll take to a new pastor 's wife ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Lisa said . " But they 'll definitely talk . I hope she knows what she 's gotten herself into . " <p> " Did any of us know that when we married pastors ? " Mimi asked . <p> Lisa smiled . " I guess not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , thinking back to when she and Sam had married , twelve years ago . She had been attending the church as a relatively new Christian when Sam arrived on the scene as pastor . " Being a church member and being a pastor 's wife are two entirely different things . " <p> " I did n't marry a pastor , " Felicia said . " If you recall , I married a businessman who decided several years into his career that he was called to be a pastor . I did n't get that vote . " <p> Gracie walked toward them , carrying a tray of drinks . She set it down on the edge of their table . " I 'm getting too old for this . Can you believe they still make me carry my own trays ? And my shoulder all messed up from that fall back in December ? " <p> Gracie had taken a tumble on some ice outside Lulu 's one evening after work a few months back and hurt her shoulder and hip . <p> " Is that still bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still go to therapy for it , but you know those doctors . You ca n't trust ' em . " She handed Mimi a glass of milk and passed Lisa an iced tea . Felicia grabbed the remaining two glasses , each filled with Diet Coke , and handed one to Jennifer . <p> " Hey ! " Gracie said . " You trying to deprive me of my hard-earned tip ? " <p> " Sorry ! " Felicia joked . " But you know I 'm working from home now . I need all the money I can get . " <p> " Well , you 'd better find a better table . These girls are tighter than a duck 's behind with their money . " She pulled four straws out of her right apron pocket and plopped them in the center of the table . <p> " I 'll be back . " She winked , then pulled up the tray against her chest and trudged away . <p> " Can you believe it 's been a year since Kitty died ? " Lisa tore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " Jennifer said . " I kind of miss her . All the snarky comments about how insignificant our churches were compared to hers . The patronizing tone . The condescending looks . " <p> " I 'm serious ! " Lisa said . " It was tragic . " <p> " I know . " Jennifer sipped her soda . " Believe me , I wish she had n't died . It was n't a piece of cake for me  --  going through that miscarriage and being considered a murder suspect in her death all in the same weekend . " There I go again , making everything about me , she told herself and inwardly winced . <p> Felicia rubbed Jennifer 's back . That 's sweet , Jennifer thought , realizing her friends remembered how difficult that time in her life had been . She 'd wanted that baby so badly . And to suffer a miscarriage , have an all-out argument with Kitty , threaten her , then have her up and fall down a ravine and break her neck ... It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mimi dabbed a trace of milk at the corner of her mouth . " We did n't like her . But she did n't deserve what happened to her . Life has been calmer and more sane and relaxing since she 's been  --  " <p> " It was a year ago yesterday , " Felicia said . " St. Patrick 's Day weekend . At the pastors ' wives ' retreat . " <p> " That reminds me ! " Mimi brightened and reached under the table . She pulled up her large purse/diaper bag and dug into its depths . In her hands appeared two **26;949;TOOLONG eggs that were the brightest kelly green Jennifer had ever seen . She laid them on the table and reached back in , producing one more . " From Megan . She wanted me to make sure to give these to you . We combined two holidays in one  --  St. Patrick 's Day and Easter , since that 's this weekend . " <p> " Carys will like this . " Jennifer picked one up and set it on top of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Felicia took another of the eggs and placed it by her drink . <p> " Who ? " Lisa asked . <p> " Norm 's new wife . " <p> " I wonder if she 'll come to the next pastors ' wives ' meeting at New Life next month ? " <p> " I already called and invited her . She 's coming . " Lisa tore open a packet of sugar and dumped it into her tea . <p> The table fell silent as Jennifer , Mimi , and Felicia all stared openmouthed at their friend . <p> " What ? " Lisa asked . <p> She really does n't know why we 're shocked , Jennifer realized . <p> " You 've been holding out on us , girlfriend ! " Mimi said . <p> " Spill it , " Felicia said . <p> " What ? There 's nothing to tell , really . " Lisa fidgeted a little in her seat . " I called her last Friday . We did n't talk that long . I just congratulated her on her wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife , then invited her to next month 's meeting . " She looked around the table . " Okay . She did sound young ... and very perky . And ... she giggled a lot . " <p> Jennifer , Felicia , and Mimi eyed one another knowingly . Yep , Jennifer thought , this is going to be a fun meeting next month . How in the world did Norm go from hard-edged , superior Kitty to an early-twenties cheerleader ? <p> " Wonder what Kitty would think ? " Felicia asked . <p> Lisa shrugged . " I 'd hope she 'd be glad that Norm found someone who loves him and is going to take care of him . " <p> Before Jennifer could say anything , Gracie arrived with their food . <p> " All right , PWs , quit your yakking and help me unload this thing . " Gracie pulled the first plate off the tray and handed it to Mimi . Mimi looked at the tuna melt and strip of cantaloupe and passed it on to Lisa . Jennifer 's was next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her Caesar salad . Last was Mimi 's hamburger . <p> They got their food situated , passing the ketchup and salt , then Felicia offered grace . <p> Mimi shoved a fry in her mouth and savored it . " I love Milo , but I got ta tell you , it 's nice to eat a full meal without messy little fingers grabbing something on my plate . " <p> Felicia poured the dressing over her salad . " I know what that 's like . Oh , the peace and quiet  --  and adult conversation ! " <p> Jennifer smiled as she thought of eleven-month-old Carys doing that same thing . But her thoughts drifted back to Kitty and the week following her death . Jennifer had been considered  --  although not officially  --  a murder suspect and had had to endure detectives following her around , treating her like a criminal , until they determined Kitty 's death had been an accident . <p> " Remember last year when those detectives were following me around ? " Jennifer asked , trying to sound nonchalant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod and say , " Mmm-hmmm . " <p> " Well , it 's happening again . At least I think it is . " <p> " What ? " Mimi half choked and plopped her burger onto her plate . She pounded on her chest with her fist as if trying to move the meat down her esophagus . " Detectives are following you around ? " <p> " I do n't know who it is . But I keep seeing this black town car everywhere I go . Just glimpses of it , really . But ... " Jennifer knew the whole thing sounded crazy . And verbalizing it made it sound even more outlandish . Maybe I 'm just making this up . " Never mind . It 's ... probably nothing . " She tried to laugh it off . " Just my overactive imagination . You know , with all the sleep deprivation and everything . " <p> " Oh , yeah , I can relate , " Mimi said . But she tilted her head toward Jennifer . " You okay ? I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would somebody follow you ? " Felicia asked . <p> " That 's just it . " Jennifer swirled her chicken strip in her barbecue sauce . " I do n't know . I ca n't think of one plausible explanation . " <p> " Maybe it 's a church member trying to dig up dirt on you . " Felicia smiled and patted Jennifer 's arm . <p> Jennifer laughed . " No , that would be Lisa with that problem . " <p> Lisa lifted her napkin to hide her face , then let it droop to just below her eyes . Wide-eyed , she looked around the diner frantically . They all laughed , but Jennifer knew Lisa was trying to put up a good front . Lisa had lost fifteen pounds in the last six months , and the sparkle in her hazel eyes had lost its shine . Poor Lisa , Jennifer thought . God , take care of this situation at her church . They do n't deserve this . They 're good people . <p> " What 's going on with your church ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , and partly because she had n't heard an update in a while . <p> Lisa dropped the napkin back to her lap and shrugged . " Same old , same old . At least Joel is still the pastor  --  though I do n't know for how much longer . He 's meeting with the head troublemaker next week to confront him . " <p> T hat 's not going to be easy . Although Jennifer and Sam had had their share of church member issues , they 'd never gone through major conflict , as Lisa and her husband , Joel , were now . She ached for them . <p> Lisa continued . " I just wish ... you know , if these people are so upset , why do they cause such trouble ? Why not just leave ? Why make it into a huge power struggle ? " <p> " Because "  --  Mimi leaned over until her shoulder was touching Lisa 's  --  " and you should know this better than any of us , Miss Assemblies of God , this is called spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vibrant and powerful in the community . He 'd rather take down a church from the inside out than have it succeed . " <p> " Oh , sure , look at it from a spiritual perspective , why do n't you ? " Felicia smiled gently . <p> " It 's hard to do that , though , is n't it ? " Jennifer asked . " Especially when the hurt is so deep . " <p> " Well , sweetie , you know you 're in our prayers . " Mimi wrapped her arm around Lisa and squeezed . <p> Lisa just nodded and looked down . Jennifer could tell her friend was embarrassed , because she 'd quickly wiped at her eyes . <p> " How are things in your life ? " Jennifer asked Felicia , trying to take some of the pressure off Lisa . <p> " Actually , ca n't complain right now . " Felicia swirled around some more dressing in her salad but did n't look anyone in the eyes . " My clients are happy . I mean , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I 'm home , I 'm , you know , sitting around watching Dr. Phil and just waiting for someone to put me to good use . " <p> " Oh , yes . " Mimi laughed . " Been there . Everybody thinks that we live to serve , huh ? Okay , well , we do , actually  --  at least that 's what my kids tell me  --  but still ! " She laughed again . <p> " So that 's been a bit of a challenge . But other than that , things are ... good . " Felicia held up crossed fingers . " Enjoy the peace while I can , right ? " <p> Jennifer waited to see if Felicia would say any more . She got the sense something else was going on with Felicia but knew her friend would speak up when the time was right . <p> Lisa must have thought the same , because she turned to Mimi . " And how about you ? How 's Dad doing ? " <p> " Awwk . " Mimi rolled her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions for Dad staying with us is that he 's supposed to attend his AA meetings . He 's still attending , but he 's also still drinking . He does it on the sly , as if he thinks we do n't notice . I do n't know what to do , honestly . We ca n't kick him out ; he 's got no place else to go . " <p> " Where 's your mom ? " Felicia asked . <p> " She 's down in Kentucky , staying with her sister . She 's definitely not interested in taking him back . And I do n't blame her . Life with my father has never been easy . But when he ran off to California with that woman ... I ca n't say I 'd take him back either , if he were my husband . " <p> " So instead , " Jennifer said , feeling a little bitter , " you , the daughter , have to take him in and parent him . " <p> Mimi half chuckled . " Yep . My sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm it . " <p> " Does n't that tick you off ? " Jennifer said . <p> " Sometimes , yes . But you know , I 'm the responsible one . " She tucked her short , blond hair behind her ears , something she did whenever she was stressed or frustrated about something . " Plus , Mark and I have been trying to look at it from a spiritual perspective . He 's my dad  --  and he needs the Lord . " <p> Just like my mother . Jennifer tried to push the thought aside . <p> " Is he going to church with you yet ? " Felicia asked . <p> " No , that 's one thing he refuses to do . But we keep working on him . It 's really cute to see Megan reprimanding him about not attending . " <p> Jennifer could picture Mimi 's precocious six-year-old giving her grandfather a lecture about loving Jesus and getting saved . <p> Gracie reappeared and dropped the check on the table . " Here 's your parting gift , ladies . Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours treat you all right . " <p> " Hey , how 's your sister doing , Gracie ? " Lisa asked as Gracie started to turn away . <p> Gracie grimaced and a shadow crossed her face . Jennifer knew Gracie 's sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago and had gone through surgery and chemo . <p> " Not good . She just went to the doc last week . It 's back , and vicious . " <p> " I thought she had it beat , " Jennifer said . <p> " We thought so , too , but when she went in for a checkup , they found it . It 's in her bones and I do n't know where all . " <p> " Oh , Gracie , we 're so sorry . " Mimi touched Gracie 's hand . Gracie squeezed it and held on . <p> " Oh , Gracie , " Jennifer murmured . <p> " That 's terrible , " said Lisa . <p> Felicia just shook her head , her face concerned . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gracie said . " So I guess I wo n't see you next time . " <p> " We 'll be praying for your sister  --  and for you , " Lisa said . <p> Gracie nodded and let go of Mimi 's hand . " I know you will . If God hears anybody , I know it 's you four women . Pray hard , will ya ? Maybe he 'll take pity on an old , crotchety woman and her sister . " She winked , then turned and walked slowly away . <p> Jennifer and the others looked at one another but did n't say anything for a moment . <p> " I had no idea . " Felicia 's eyes followed Gracie as she tended to her other customers on the opposite side of the restaurant . <p> " She did n't let on at all that something was up , " Mimi said , looking amazed by how well Gracie had covered up her pain . <p> " Maybe we should pray for her and her sister right now , " Lisa suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better time and place to pray . <p> Katt 's in the Cradle 2009 by Ginger Kolbaba and Christy Scannell <br> Continues ...
