Public TV too often likes its art tame and respectable , but this documentary mini-series  --  which examines Edouard Manet 's Olympia , Huckleberry Finn , 1920s jazz and racy 1930s movies  --  recovers what was shocking in art we have ( mostly ) grown comfortable with . The enlightening Manet episode unpacks 19th century French society to show how a nude courtesan roiled the salons by staring frankly at the viewer ; the Finn segment examines a contemporary push to pull the book ( charged with racism ) from a school . The series comes down on the side of art , natch , but deserves credit for arguing , not assuming , its point . <P>  --  J.P .
