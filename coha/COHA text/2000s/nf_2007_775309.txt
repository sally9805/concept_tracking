September 1939-May 1940 // " On Friday morning , September 1 , the young butcher 's lad came and told us : There has been a radio announcement , we already held Danzig and the Corridor , the war with Poland was under way , England and France remained neutral , " Victor Klemperer wrote in his diary on September 3 . " I said to Eva that a morphine injection or something similar was the best thing for us ; our life was over . " 1 // Klemperer was of Jewish origin ; in his youth he converted to Protestantism and later on married a Protestant " Aryan . " In 1935 he was dismissed from the Technical University in Dresden , where he taught Romance languages and literature ; yet he went on living in the city , painstakingly recording what happened to him and around him . The British and French responses to the German attack remained uncertain for two days . " Annemarie brought two bottles of sparkling wine for Eva 's birthday , " Klemperer reported on September 4 . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the English declaration of war . So today it 's the turn of the second one . " 2 // In Warsaw , Chaim Kaplan , the director of a Hebrew school , was confident that this time Britain and France would not betray their ally as they had betrayed Czechoslovakia in 1938 . On the first day of the war Kaplan sensed the apocalyptic nature of the new conflict : " We are witnessing the dawn of a new era in the history of the world . This war will indeed bring destruction upon human civilization . But this is a civilization that merits annihilation and destruction . " 3 Kaplan was convinced that ultimately Nazism would be defeated but that the struggle would entail enormous losses for all . // The Hebrew school director also grasped the peculiar threat that the outbreak of the war represented for the Jews . In that same September 1 entry , he added , " As for the Jews , their danger is seven times greater . Wherever Hitler 's foot treads there is no hope for the Jewish people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1939 , in which the Nazi leader threatened the Jews with extermination in case of world war . The Jews were thus more eager than most to take a hand at common defense : " When the order was issued that all the inhabitants of the city must dig shelter trenches for protection from air raids , the Jews came in numbers . I , too , was among them . " 4 // On September 8 the Wehrmacht occupied Lodz , the second largest Polish city : " All of a sudden the terrifying news : Lodz has been surrendered ! " Dawid Sierakowiak , a Jewish youngster , barely fifteen , recorded . " All conversation stops ; the streets grow deserted ; faces and hearts are covered with gloom , cold severity and hostility . Mr. Grabinski comes back from downtown and tells how the local Germans greeted their countrymen . The Grand Hotel where the General Staff is expected to stay is bedecked with garlands of flowers : Ethnic German civilians  --  boys , girls  --  jump into the passing military cars with happy cries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything patriotically and nationalistically German that was hidden in the past now shows its true face . " 5 // And in Warsaw again , Adam Czerniak ? w , an employee of the Polish foreign trade clearinghouse and an active member of the Jewish community , was organizing a Jewish Citizens Committee to work with the Polish authorities : " The Jewish Citizens Committee of the capital city of Warsaw , " he wrote on September 13 , " received legal recognition and was established in the Community building . " 6 On September 23 he further noted : " Mayor Starzynski named me Chairman of the Jewish Community in Warsaw . A historic role in a besieged city . I will try to live up to it . " 7 Four days later Poland surrendered . // The voices of many Jewish chroniclers will be heard in this volume , and yet all of them , as different as they may be , offer but a faint glimpse of the extraordinary diversity that was the world of European Jewry on the edge of destruction . After a steady decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural-ethnic Jewishness , no obvious common denominator fitted the maze of parties , associations , groups , and some nine million individuals , spread all over the Continent , who nonetheless considered themselves Jews ( or were considered as such ) . This diversity resulted from the impact of distinct national histories , the dynamics of large-scale migrations , a predominantly urban-centered life , a constant economic and social mobility driven by any number of individual strategies in the face of surrounding hostility and prejudice or , obversely , by the opportunities offered in liberal surroundings . These constant changes contributed to ever-greater fragmentation within the Diaspora , mainly during the chaotic decades that separated the late nineteenth century from the eve of World War II . // Where , for example , should one locate young Sierakowiak , the Lodz diarist ? In his diary entries , started just before the beginning of the war , we discover an artisan family steeped in Jewish tradition , Dawid 's own easy familiarity with this tradition and yet , at the same time , a strong commitment to communism ( " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he wrote somewhat later ) . 8 Sierakowiak 's divided world was not untypical of the multiple and at times contradictory allegiances coexisting in various segments in Jewish society on the eve of the war : Liberals of various nuances , Social Democrats , Bundists , Trotskyites , Stalinists , Zionists of all possible stripes and factions , religious Jews sparring in endless dogmatic or " tribal " feuds , and , until the end of 1938 , a few thousand members of fascist parties , particularly in Mussolini 's Italy . 9 Yet for many Jews , mainly in Western Europe , the main goal was social and cultural assimilation into surrounding society , while maintaining some elements of " Jewish identity , " whatever that meant . // All these trends and movements should be multiplied by any number of national or regional idiosyncrasies and internecine struggles , and , of course , by a high count of sometimes notorious individual oddities . Thus the old and terminally ill Sigmund Freud , who had fled from Vienna to London after the Anschluss . . . //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
