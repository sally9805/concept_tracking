Fibromyalgia brings pain , fatigue , and frustration to millions of sufferers . If you 're one of them , here 's how to fight back " You 're not crazy . " <p> We all need to hear those words from time to time . But for people with the often frustrating , sometimes frightening , and always challenging condition called fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) , it can take several years and half a dozen doctors to get a clean bill of mental health . <p> Fibromyalgia is a ghost of an ailment ; it can cause life-altering pain , but it remains invisible to conventional diagnostic tests . Without hard data to study , the medical community has been slow to admit that fibromyalgia exists , let alone to develop treatment strategies . <p> But new research not only shows that fibromyalgia is real , but it also offers hope in beating the pain . And people seeking relief from fibromyalgia have more options than ever before . When the Pain Does n't Stop <p> About 5 million people , 2% of the US population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthritis Foundation . Most are women . ( In Canada , nearly 1 million have the disease . ) The pain profile varies from one person to another , but it typically takes the form of intense burning or aching sensations in various muscles throughout the body , often accompanied by stiffness . <p> Another hallmark of FMS is extreme fatigue , which may be partly due to the fact that the pain prevents restful sleep . Fibromyalgia pain , which can be intense , may be felt every day and continue unabated for months . " If you feel this kind of pain and fatigue for 6 months or more and do n't know the cause , suspect fibromyalgia , " says Don Goldenberg , MD , director of the Arthritis/Fibromyalgia Center at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Boston and a medical advisor for the Arthritis Foundation . <p> Unlike arthritis , fibromyalgia does n't produce pain or swelling in joints . And the usual tools for detecting disease-such as x-rays and blood tests-also fail to turn up anything abnormal in people with the illness . Which is why , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychological problem rather than a physical one . Like the elephant in the Dr. Seuss story Horton Hears a Who , fibromyalgia patients were thought to be making fanciful claims , since no one else could see what they were talking about . But like Horton , it turns out that FMS patients were right all along . <p> " We 've really accumulated evidence that FMS is a real , physical disorder , " says Dr. Goldenberg . Doctors can diagnose fibromyalgia by following the guidelines of the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) . ( See " Do You Have Fibromyalgia ? " on p. 129 . ) If your doctor is n't familiar with FMS , Dr. Goldenberg suggests contacting the ACR or the Arthritis Foundation to be referred to a rheumatologist in your area . What 's Going On ? <p> Ask the experts what causes fibromyalgia-what 's happening in the body to produce the pain , fatigue , and other symptoms-and you get a resigned , if deeply considered , shrug . <p> " There are a couple of different theories , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tanger Center for Health Management at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston . " We have a long way to go before we fully understand it , but we are making progress . " <p> For example , a study presented at last year 's meeting of the ACR suggests that in people with fibromyalgia , the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) does n't process pain signals normally . In the study , researchers applied heat to the hands of a group of FMS patients and a group of healthy subjects . In the FMS patients , the blips of pain from each jolt of heat did n't subside between applications the way they did in the healthy group . Instead , the nervous system held on to the pain signals . The sensations of pain accumulated , causing the FMS patients to report feeling more pain than the other group reported . <p> This phenomenon is not only a sign that there 's a problem with the nervous system , but it may also be a cause of the pain , says Roland Staud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're all constantly exposed to stimuli as we go through our day , " explains Dr. Staud . The inability to let go of this input may contribute to the constant state of pain in people with FMS , he says . But what causes a person 's nervous system to become so grabby is n't known . Taking Control <p> If you 've got a mysterious ailment that 's difficult to diagnose , has an unknown cause , and is n't well understood , is there much room for hope ? <p> There 's plenty . According to Dr. Goldenberg , less than 20% of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia are disabled by the condition . And many cases get better over time . " In fact , about 60% of our patients say they feel better now than they did 10 years ago , " Dr. Goldenberg notes . Putting yourself on the positive side of those statistics takes careful planning , but you can tilt the odds in your favor by following these suggestions : <p> Find a savvy partner . " One of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , " says Dr. Rooks . " A doctor can give you the information you need to make important medical decisions and support you in doing self-care . " Because what works with one person may not work with another , FMS is tricky to treat with medication , says Dr. Rooks , so you 'll have to communicate openly with your doctor to find a regimen that helps you . <p> Exercise carefully . " Exercise plays a keystone role in managing FMS , " says Dr. Rooks . Some of the most encouraging studies of fibromyalgia show that regular exercise can produce impressive improvements in the pain of FMS sufferers . For example , Dr. Rooks conducted a study in which 31 women performed cardiovascular , strength training , and flexibility exercises three times a week . After 20 weeks , they reported less pain , fatigue , and stiffness , were more fit , and had higher levels of function . Because the pain of fibromyalgia makes exercising difficult , Dr. Rooks recommends starting light and progressing slowly . " You should start with something that feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 5 minutes of walking . Increase about 30 seconds a week . " Bonus : An exercise program not only has physical benefits , but it can also boost your morale by letting you experience success at a time when you often feel nothing 's working . <p> Know your limits . Whether exercising at the gym or cleaning the living room , someone with FMS needs to be honest about what he can and ca n't do . Overexertion can result in painful consequences , but doing too little can cheat you of the benefits of exercise . How do you know when enough 's enough ? <p> Listen to your body . It 's okay to exercise or be active while feeling the pain level that you typically experience from fibromyalgia . But if exercising causes pain levels to become more intense , back off , and try a lighter workload when you feel ready . <p> Do n't be afraid . Exercise is difficult for some FMS patients not only because of the pain they feel but because it seems as if their body is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign , the muscle pain produced by FMS is a symptom of the illness . " There 's no evidence that people with FMS are more susceptible to injury than people without it , " says Dr. Rooks . He notes that in his study , all the subjects performed the exercise program regularly even while experiencing pain from FMS , but none of them suffered any injuries . <p> Relax . Stress seems to worsen FMS symptoms , so make it a priority to give yourself a break . " Hot baths , meditation , listening to music ; take full advantage of whatever works for you , " says Dr. Rooks . And if you have FMS , it 's really important to schedule your day appropriately for your level of strength and energy . " Trying to push yourself will just cause added stress , and that can exacerbate your pain and fatigue . " <p> Seek out support . " Many people with FMS have never met anyone else with the condition , " Dr. Rooks says . Communicate with others in the same boat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swap advice . Just remember to focus on solutions , not problems . " You want to spend your energy solving problems , not focusing on the fact that these problems exist , " says Dr. Rooks . * Take Control-We Can Help ! <p> Prevention has partnered with the Arthritis Foundation to bring you the latest medical breakthroughs , the best prevention strategies , and the most effective treatments for arthritis and related conditions .

It 's okay to exercise through your " normal " pain levels , but if exercise causes the pain to worsen significantly , back off . <p> <p> MIX IT UP .

In his study , Dr. Rooks had his patients exercise in groups . He credits this as one reason why they were able to keep exercising despite their pain ; it made the exercise sessions a fun , social experience instead of a chore . ( If you exercise with friends who do n't have FMS , make sure they understand your limitations . ) Do You Have Fibromyalgia ? <p> The American College of Rheumatology says that a person has fibromyalgia ( FMS ) if they meet the following conditions : Widespread muscle pain that lasts 3 months or more Pain in at least 11 of 18 tender points shown below <p> Your doctor , or a rheumatologist , can check the tender points to diagnose FMS . <p> If pressing on the tender points causes pain , you may have fibromyalgia .

When symptoms flare , eating right becomes less of a priority . Trevethan , who specializes in giving nutrition advice to people with fibromyalgia ( FMS ) , makes the following suggestions : <p> <p> EAT TO SLEEP . Sleep is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as caffeine and alcohol for at least 5 hours before going to bed . For a sleep-promoting bedtime snack , try a high-carb bowl of whole grain cereal sprinkled with fruit , or a bowl of warm oatmeal . <p> <p> KEEP A RECORD . Many people with FMS experience irritable bowel symptoms such as diarrhea or upset stomach . Keeping a record of what foods you eat can help you identify and avoid the foods that trigger these symptoms . <p> <p> PLAN AHEAD . People with fibromyalgia typically have good days and bad days . " When you 're feeling better , prepare some meals in advance , and keep them in the fridge or freezer , " says Trevethan . You may not feel like chopping vegetables when your pain flares up , but if there 's a salad already made , you 'll be less tempted to order a pizza ( or you 'll order a smaller one ) . <p> <p> GRAZE , DO N'T GORGE . Eating several snacks and small meals every day instead of a few large spreads gives your body a constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For at least three of these meal-ettes , include milk , carbohydrates ( whole grains , fruits , or vegetables ) , and monounsaturated fats ( nuts , olives , or avocados ) . " Eat when you 're hungry ; stop before you 're overfull , " says Trevethan . For most people , that means munching every 3 hours or so . <p> <p> BE SENSIBLY SKEPTICAL . There 's a lot of misinformation about fibromyalgia , says Trevethan , which is not surprising , since there are so many unanswered questions about it . When you come across a recommendation for this supplement or that nutrient , check it with a reputable source , such as your specialist or the American Dietetic Association www.eatright.org . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>
