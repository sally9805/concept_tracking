In fact , according to Rosanna Hertz , PhD , professor of sociology and chair of the women 's studies department at Wellesley College , new wives approach their new " job " with the same kind of zeal that they previously might have given to a corporation . " They even create a little cottage industry out of the people they 're employing : someone to clean the house , someone to do the garden , another person to take care of the kids .
