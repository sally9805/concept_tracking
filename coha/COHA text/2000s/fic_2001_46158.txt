In The Last Dinosaur Book , W. J. T. Mitchell calls the terrible lizards " the most publicized animal image on the planet . " As he demonstrates , dinosaurs have been embraced by popular culture for well over a century now , and the changes in image that the extinct reptiles have undergone often reflect social influences as much as they do scientific discoveries . Richard Chwedyk certainly seems to understand this point , as you 'll soon see . Mr. Chwedyk lives in Chicago with his wife , poet Pam Miller . His last appearance here was " Auteur Theory " in our special Film Issue in July , 1998 . He says this story owes a big debt to Tina lens and to Algis Budrys . <p> Did he smile his work to see ? Did he who made the lamb make thee ? - William Blake AXEL WAS THE FIRST TO SEE the car coming down the driveway from the main road . He stood on the table next to the picture window , where he always stands after breakfast , looking out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clouds ( if it is n't ) , shifting his weight from one clumpy foot to the other , tail raised to balance himself against the slick , smooth surface . His mouth , as always , was wide open , displaying rows of benign teeth  --  benign compared to the predator he was modeled upon ; and his tiny black eyes were alight with amazement , as always , as if he was witness to a secret miracle every moment . " Huuuuuu-man ! " he shouted . " Huuuu-man coming up the road ! " I had just finished cleaning up the kitchen , taking stock of the food supplies : plenty of pellets ( some saurs still preferred them ) ; another day 's worth of collards and meat ; and enough of the ever-essential oranges to last out the week . I needed more coffee , but since it was " human stuff " it took a lesser priority . A razor , too , would have been nice , and a new hairbrush . A pair of jeans would n't have hurt either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but I was getting off the subject of food . I drank my cold , leftover breakfast coffee with a touch of melancholy as I walked into the living room . " Huuuuu-man ! " The room was bright . The windows were open . Rain was predicted for that night but just then you could n't ask for more beautiful spring weather . Few saurs paid attention to Axel 's alarm , since Axel , in his constant ebullience , often announced the arrival of alien battle cruisers , or warned us of approaching death rays , tidal waves ( we are four hundred kilometers from the ocean ) , and Confederate Army divisions charging our house from out of the woods . " Are you goofing around again , Axel ? " Agnes said , her spiked tail and back plates upright in a guarded stance . " Because if you are - " " Real , " Axel insisted . " Real real real real . Big blue car coming down the driveway ! " He pointed out the window with his tiny forepaw . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes , the sort of car that 's always been popular with young men who want to show the world that they 've arrived . I wondered briefly if I 'd ever wanted that : the sense of validation those wheels provided . I could n't remember , but when I was a boy , like every other kid , I wanted everything . " Is it the doctor ? " Agnes asked . " She 's not due until this afternoon . " " It 's not that horrible researcher , is it ? The one who wants a tissue sample from Hetman . " " Researchers are n't Mercedes-type people , " I assured her . " I 'll give him some tissue to sample ! " She swung her tail back to demonstrate . Her battle-stance is less impressive when you consider that Agnes is forty centimeters long , her head is about the size of an apricot , and her tail spikes really would n't stand up in a fight . " No , " I said as I looked down at Axel and Axel looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Visitor ! " Axel repeated in a whisper , as if he 'd heard the word for the first time . He had n't , of course . Visitors are n't frequent here , but they 're certainly not unheard of . Delivery drivers come all the time . Dr. Margaret Pagliotti visits once a week . Folks from the Atherton Foundation stop by for regular inspections . But there are other visitors , people who come by just to see the saurs . Most people these days hardly remember them . The smallest saur is no more than ten centimeters long . The largest one is a meter and a half tall . They 're not " real " dinosaurs  --  that 's another business altogether  --  but they were modeled after them , sometimes to painstaking detail , but more often to the cuter , cartoonish caricatures that children of many generations before wore on their pajamas or had printed on their lunchboxes and notebooks . They were an outgrowth of that vision of dinosaurs as cuddly buddies , friends to all children everywhere - moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with . That 's what they were designed to be . That 's why they were brought into the world . Forget for the moment that the manufacturers had plans to make enormous sums of money on them , at which they succeeded ( several million were sold ) ; forget also that the designers were trying to put forward their own subtle agenda : that bioengineering and its nanotech components could be safe and fun - cuddly , like a shoebox-sized triceratops - an agenda at which they were far less successful . Forget all that , at least for the moment . To the saurs themselves , they had come into being to be friends , buddies , giving out love and receiving affection from appreciative girls and boys . That 's what they were designed to do - that , and nothing else . The designers fidgeted about for a name - they did n't like " life-toy , " since it contained the troublesome " life " word . They did n't want the saurs confused with " animals , " since that would place them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the marketing departments , so someone went out and wrote a definition of it : a toy modeled from bio-engineered materials , behaving without behavior , lifelike without being " alive . " The blue Mercedes parked in the gravel at the end of the driveway . I looked around our old Victorian-style house and its saurian occupants : the group gathered around the video screen watching a Buster Keaton film ; little ones , mouse- and squirrel-sized guys riding across the living room on the battery-powered carts we call skates ; in the dining room , another group of little ones were sitting before the big Reggiesystem computer , having a geography lesson ( I could tell it was geography because I could hear them repeating the word " Togo " in unison ) ; in another comer sat the Five Wise Buddhasaurs , blowing into their plastic horns ; further back , in the library , I could see Diogenes and Hubert ( two of the biggest guys , very tyrannosaurian ) shelving books ( yes , we still have books here , and even the saurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type styles , even the little colophons ) ; also in there was Hetman 's bassinet-sized hospital bed , rolled over to the sunniest window . Along with the usual furniture , scattered about were the hassocks and clever stair-step things the saurs use to get up on the furniture ; the old wheelchair lift - adapted to meet the needs of the saurs - was in operation , transporting the little and the lame back and forth between first and second floors . It 's a world I 've grown accustomed to , but one that many visitors find fairly startling , and some even find disturbing . " Well , " I said to everyone within earshot , " ready for a visitor ? " Most were indifferent to the prospect . Some jumped onto skates and rode off to other parts . Others climbed up on the chairs and couches , not wanting to be underfoot with a stranger in the house . Charlie , a light brown badger-sized triceratops , hobbled away from the group around the video , accompanied by his beloved companion , Rosie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all their mastery of eyes , ears , brains , and larynxes , had trouble with limbs , and it was hard to find a saur who did n't walk with at least a slight defect , though many limped for other reasons . " If it 's that Joe , " Charlie called back to me , " tell him I 'm not here . Tell him I 'm dead . " Charlie has been saying this for years whenever visitors come by , even though in all that time not one of them has been named Joe . " Humans , " Agnes grumbled . " Idiots . I wish they 'd all just leave us alone . " I noticed her mate , Sluggo , was n't with her and I asked where he was . " Feeding squirrels . Feeding sparrows . He 's always feeding someone , like some goddamned Saint Francis . " " He never feeds us , " said Pierrot , a pint-sized theropod standing by the couch closest to the window , with his friend Jean-Claude , a dark green tyrannosur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat out the word with a resonance that belied her size . " Hopeless , brainless embarrassments ! " " I 'm glad to see the lovely day has not affected Agnes 's mood , " said Doc , a light brown theropod just under a meter tall , with heavy-lidded eyes and a serene smile that makes you think he must have gotten into the liquor cabinet . " That is her nature , " I said to Doc as I brushed my hair back . He sat on a plastic box over which he could drape his tail and rest his weary legs . Before him played two of the tiniest saurs in the house , named Slim and Slam . The two held a pen between them as if it were an enormous treetrunk and drew lines and curves on a sheet of paper spread before them . " And nature , " he replied , " we know , is a thing we should n't adjust without caution . " " I hate when you talk about me as if I ca n't hear ! " Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask before , " Doc said as he watched Slim and Slam at work/play , " did you sleep well ? " " Yes , " I lied . I knew I 'd had a nightmare but I could n't remember any of the details . The best I could recall was a vague sense of hiding in a cramped , dark place . Perhaps I 'd cried out in my sleep . " You did ? " The skin behind Doc 's thick eyelids furrowed as he looked up at me . " Of course . Why do you ask ? " " No reason . " The deep voice took on a placating smoothness . " You look tired . " We heard the soft clip of a very expensive car door shutting outside . " I 'd better go out and greet our visitor , " I said . " Is the security on ? " Agnes asked sharply . " Of course . You know it 's always on . " " Hmmph ! " She positioned herself under the lamp table next to the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a matter of remembering . The visitor stood outside , reluctant , it seemed , to step onto the porch . He looked in his early thirties - a few years younger than myself , I figured - with an athletic build , light gray eyes , and strong facial features . His expression had that severity most professional people affect these days , with downward-bent forehead lines ending in a little IV " between his eyebrows . He wore a dark blue sports jacket , light gray slacks , and a rose  --  colored shirt with the top button open . It was all very acquired and practiced , as if he were living up to a model . But everyone out there in the real world acted that way . So would I , if I were out there . " Look at that ! " Axel shouted . " He 's bald ! " He jumped up and down as I went to the door . " Take me with ! Please ! Please ! " " You 'll have to behave yourself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just want to watch when he pulls out his mini-machine gun and starts shooting - du-du-du-du-du-du - right through the walls ! " Agnes groaned . I picked Axel up and cradled him in my right arm . As I looked down at him , I could n't help noticing the long scar down his back . It 's been many years since that scar was made , but you could tell it had been a deep , nasty cut that left it . Out on the porch , I said " Good morning , " to the visitor . I must have looked a mess , but you can never dress for visitors because you never know when they 're coming . " Morning , " he said with a deep , rehearsed voice . " You must be Groverton . " " That 's me . " I shifted Axel over to my left side and held out my hand . " Tom Groverton . And this is Axel . " Axel raised a forepaw and said " Hiya ! " but the visitor ignored him . I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name . " You 're looking for someone , are n't you ? Most visitors are . " He spoke hesitantly , as if he wished he 'd brought an attorney with him . " I do n't really know if he 's - " " HIYA ! 11 Axel tried again . " - here . I - we , my brother and I - had him when we were kids . There 's not much chance of it , but I thought - " " HIYA " The visitor looked at Axel at last and slightly bowed his head . " - I thought he might be up here . " I gestured for him to come up on the porch and sit down on the old bench . " Maybe you could give me a little description of him . " " He was - is , I guess - a stegosaur . Maybe thirty-five centimeters long . Orange on the top , mostly , and a kind of purple color on the bottom . Some patches of yellow between the orange and the purple . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His head is more beak-shaped than rounded off . " He stood with his hands in the pockets of his slacks , refusing to sit on the bench . " My brother named him Elliot . " Axel made a hissing , gasping sort of sound . " Elliot ! " " A lot of saurs changed their names once we offered them shelter here . " My mustache brushed my lower lip . " I ca n't keep track of whose name was given and whose was chosen , but we do have a saur here named Elliot who fits that description . Do you want to see him ? " " Yes ! " His reply was so emphatic it seemed to startle him . " You understand , I hope , that I 'll first have to check with Elliot . Would you be disappointed if Elliot did n't want to see you ? " " I do n't know . " He returned to his previous , severe expression . " I do n't understand a lot about this operation . " " The point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guys were extremely traumatized before they got here . Some of them were barely alive . You did n't have to have personally hurt him to remind him of days he 'd rather not remember . That 's why I need to check with Elliot first . " " I do n't really understand . " He tugged his slacks at the knees before finally taking a seat . " They 're just toys , are n't they ? " " If that were true , would you be here ? " He looked away and exhaled with a hint of frustration . " Okay . Whatever . " I took him inside . The visitor was surprised at the number of saurs gathered around the video screen . They were now watching Chaplin in Modern Times . " How many you got here ? " " Ninety-eight in this house , all counted , which is n't a lot considering how many were made . Some folks wonder why the foundation set up houses for the saurs . Why not reservations or preserves ? They forget that saurs do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . They were designed to be domestic . " And yet , when children tired of their saurs and stopped taking care of them , their parents drove them out to the woods or to parks and dumped them . It was worse than dumping cats or dogs : they at least had some vague instincts to work with . The saurs pretty much had to start from scratch , which is why so many of them starved , froze , were run over by vehicles or were eaten by predators . I wondered if any of the saurs " designers ever imagined their creations would end up in a house like this . They had guaranteed the investors , the executives , and the buying public that the saurs were limited to a relatively few responses and reactions . They were supposed to be organic computers , and very simple ones at that . They could remember names and recognize faces , engage in simple conversations . They would sing the " Dinosaur Song " la hideous thing that started " Yar-wooo , yar-wooo , yarwooo/the dinosaurs love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sad he would know how to respond with a joke . Yes , the designers said , they were sophisticated creations , almost miraculous , a high point in what they had mastered by tweaking a few genes - but they were not to be confused with living things . They could respond to stimuli , they could retain data , but that does n't make something a " living " thing , they said . A bell rang in the library . " Hetman ! Hetman ! " Axel squirmed around under my arm . But just then I heard another commotion in the kitchen . Agnes was shouting . I excused myself from the visitor and entered the kitchen just in time to see Jean-Claude on the sink with Pierrot on his back , trying to open the freezer door . " Hey ! " Agnes shouted at them . " You idiots get down from there ! " " Honestly , guys . " I helped the two of them back down onto the floor . " Could n't you wait until lunch ? You know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pierrot corrected me . " We - were just - guarding , yeah  --  guarding the meat , in case the visitor tried to steal it ! " " I wish someone would steal you , " Agnes grunted . " The visitor steals Pierrot ! " Axel yelled . " He takes him and he throws him down a well - and he 's falling-falling-falling  --  AAAAAAHHHHhhhh ! " " Look what you started , " I said to Agnes . " It was a bad idea to create carnosaurs , " Agnes sighed . " It 's meat . Meat equals stupid . It must be . " Jean-Claude and Pierrot ran out of the kitchen , Agnes went back to her hiding place , and Axel quieted down . The visitor had moved on to the dining room when I returned . He watched the group gathered around the Reggiesystem computer . On the screen was an animated version of a rocket taking off , moving farther and farther away from the planet . " Where is the spaceship going ? " asked the steady , soft Reggiesystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathered saurs . Tyrone , a hamster-sized theropod , bent over and listened as Alfie , his constant buddy , whispered to him . " The Walkuere space station ? " Tyrone replied . " Correct . " The Reggiesystem played a little synthesized melody . The other assembled saurs cheered . The visitor watched , two fingers pressed against his lips . " Some of the saurs are quite clever , " I told him . " Some not so . Some can speak very well . Some ca n't . The problem is that you ca n't always assume which are which . Some saurs who can speak choose not to . Some are still too traumatized . " Axel waved to Alfie and Tyrone . " They all seem hooked up in some way , " the visitor observed , " like they have mates and children and whatever else . They 're supposed to be asexual , are n't they ? " I shrugged . " These attachments they make to each other have baffled everyone who 's studied them . Reproductively they 're supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse , or a parent , or an offspring , or a sibling , as if the need to establish familial connections transcends genetics . Who knows ? Their designers know less about them now than when they first created them . " Take their life span . They were supposed to live for five years , tops . Doc over there is twenty-eight . And Agnes under the table is twenty-five . " " How dare you ! " Agnes barked . " Tell him everything , why do n't you ? " There were things I would n't mention to the visitor , or to anyone else . Like Bronte , sitting on the couch , warming the orphan bird eggs that Sluggo brings to her . Some of them hatch , and Sluggo feeds them - little robins and sparrows and finches - until they 're big enough to fly from the window ledge . And then there 's the egg I found Bronte with the other day , the one that does n't resemble any bird egg I 've ever seen . In the library , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . Fred and Ginger practiced a dance . The Five Wise Buddhasaurs hooked up their plastic horns to a synthesizer , so that their instruments sounded full-sized . Their cacophonies only occasionally coalesced into some charming harmonies . Over in the far comer of the library , where the sun came through the windows most directly , Hetman rested on his little bed . Hermione , an apatosaur , stood nearby , watching over him . " It 's okay , " she said . " A bad dream . " " S-s-orry , " hissed Hetman . " I did n't mean to disturb anyone . I rang the bell in my sleep . " " Jesus , " the visitor whispered as he got a look at Hetman . Hetman 's been in the little bed ever since he came here . His hind legs were crushed under some vehicle ; his forelimbs were hacked off and his eyes burned out . No one thought he 'd live more than a few days when he was found , if that , but he 's been here many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Someone is always here . Whatever you need , we 'll get . " " I 'm here ! " Axel squirmed under my arm again . " I 'll get for Het ! I 'll stay ! Can I stay ? Want me to stay with you , Hetman ? " " Yes , Axel , " Hetman said with a raspy whisper . " Keep me from falling asleep again . Tell me once more all about the tidal wave . " I put Axel down next to Hetman . The lines in the visitor 's forehead looked deeper , the little " V " looked liked it had been carved in . " Who could do a thing like that ? " I did n't answer . Such questions , even when rhetorical , are meaningless . The saurs were sent out into the world with simple physiologies that demanded a few food pellets , water , and a litter box . Sweet natures , a few prepared phrases , a few songs . They were delivered into the hands of wealthy parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford them as to please their children . The children were told the saurs were toys and the children played with them like they were toys  --  which meant many of the saurs were suffocated , drowned , starved , crushed , beaten , vivisected . I can go on for hours , cataloging cruelties , tragedies , mistakes : how Hubert , tortured to the point of near madness , decided to use his tyrannosaurian teeth and claws to defend himself and was almost destroyed for it ; how Diogenes had been shown a box of food pellets by the father who bought him and was told , " When these run out , so do you . " There were stories like that behind nearly every small , strange-shaped , puzzled , puzzling face in this house . Had I come from a more affluent background , would I have done the same ? I felt too honest to answer either way . I led the visitor upstairs . " This place would drive me nuts , " he said softly . " How could the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalled by what he 'd seen of Hetman , I gave him the best answer I could think of for free . " In those days , designers thought of each little piece of the genome , each little element , as a symbol , like a letter printed on a wooden block . Each letter , they thought , had a simple denotative definition . When you placed the C next to the A and followed them with T , you could spell " cat . " That it might all be a little more complicated did n't occur to them . " The visitor took the stairs slowly , carefully reviewing each step . " So , these engineers learned their lesson , huh ? " They think so . " We passed the dark little bedroom where Tibor keeps his cardboard castle . It 's really quite a shambles , but Tibor , a runt of an apatosaur with a stem Beethoven-like face , sits there all day and hatches Napoleonic schemes . On the other side of the room sits a cardboard box on a dresser which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing has happened with any of her experiments so far , but I keep two fire extinguishers in the room anyway . Elliot and his mate , Syrena , a bright red stegosaur , hang out in a bedroom on the second floor with Preston , a chunky , round-headed theropod . " If you could wait here a moment , " I said to the visitor , " I 'll check with Elliot . " Preston worked away slowly but determinedly on a computer keyboard with his tiny two-digit-each forepaws . I described the visitor to Elliot and asked if he 'd mind seeing him . He thought for a moment , looking to Syrena for advice . " It must be Danny , " Elliot said , his voice so soft it would make a whisper sound like an outcry . " I told you about him . Danny never did anything bad to me , except - leave me . " " He pressed closer to his mate and rubbed his face against hers . " I 'll see him , if he wants to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily distracted by Preston at his keyboard . He read over his shoulder : " By dawn the crowd in the Plaza had swelled to ten thousand . The Ambassador had an excellent view of the frenzied multitude from his window . They all wore their red bandannas and stoked the air above them with their banners , chanting that the world of Lorair was their birthright ... " " This is his eighth novel , " I told the visitor . " He publishes them ? " " Not under his own name . " But then he saw Elliot , and his old expression completely evaporated . It seemed to reveal , maybe for the first time in years , a wound as deep as the scar on Axel 's back . " Elliot ? " " Danny ? " The visitor bent down until his head was nearly resting on the desk 's mahogany top . " Been a long time , " the visitor mumbled . Elliot nodded apprehensively . The visitor looked up at me first , then at the other saurs in the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there somewhere Elliot and I could talk alone for a little while ? " I gestured to the others and helped them out into the hallway . " It wo n't be for long " I said to them . And to Elliot : " We 'll be right outside if you need anything . " As I shut the door I looked down to see Agnes staring up at me , her expression as hard as a Brazil nut . " It 's all right , " I told her . " Nothing 's going to happen . " I hoped I was right . That was my responsibility : to make sure nothing happened . Agnes kept looking at me . Her tail tapped against the floor . Behind her gathered a number of curious saurs , including all the biggest guys : Doc , Diogenes , Hubert , and Sam . " Nothing will happen , " said Doc , staring coolly at the closed door . " If it does , it wo n't be without someone feeling great regret . " I knew that " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickened . The saurs waited quietly , except for Agnes , still thrumming with her tail . When the door finally opened it did so slowly . The visitor came out , looking a little flushed , his skin a little shinier . " Hey , Elliot ! " Agnes shouted back into the room . " You all right ? " I wiped some sweat from my brow and escorted the visitor back to his Mercedes . He said nothing until he got back into his car . " Thanks . " That was it . He drove off and has n't been back , not so far . That 's how it usually goes . A week later , the Atherton Foundation received an anonymous donation of ten thousand dollars , directed to this particular house . That too is how it usually goes . When I went back upstairs , all the saurs had dispersed save for Agnes , tail raised as if she might be considering giving me a whack with it just for good measure . Elliot was still on the desk , right where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little plastic figure , a soldier in uniform and helmet , the type that comes in a big toy set . The visitor must have brought it - and left it there . " What is that ? " I asked . " It 's Sarge , " Elliot said with his whispering voice , not taking his eyes off the little figure . " He used to leave it by my box when he went to school . " This is Sarge/he told me back then.Now you have a toy to play with too . " I thought of Sarge as a little figure of him , of Danny , the boy who owned - who I stayed with . Danny had me , and I had Danny , or Sarge , that is . When things got bad , before I was taken away , I hid Sarge , slipped him into a heating vent through a loose grate . I thought that if they were going to hurt me they might want to hurt Sarge too . I wonder if he 's been in there all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe Danny just found him , and that 's why he came today . " " It was silly of me , was n't it ? To hide Sarge like that ? " I shook my head . " Not silly at all . " I bent down to look at Sarge from the same eye level as Elliot . " What should we do with him ? " " I do n't know . " Elliot twisted his head a little to one side and then to the other . " Could we put him in the museum ? If I change my mind we could bring him down again . At least I 'll always know where he is . " " The museum " is just a room in the attic . It 's not very big , but it 's loaded with shelves , and on the shelves are hundreds of toys : dolls , drums , ray guns , puzzles , wooden figures and plastic vehicles . There are also neckties , handkerchiefs , hats , vests , photographs , notes , tempera paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room was left by one visitor or another for one saur or another . Over the years , it 's grown into quite a collection . I carefully picked up Elliot with one hand and , just as carefully , picked Sarge up with the other . " We 'll take him there now , and you can pick out a place for him yourself . " Agnes moved out of the way as I came by with Elliot and Sarge . Sluggo rolled an orange to her and the sweet smell of the fruit distracted her at last . That afternoon , Dr. Margaret Pagliotti stopped by on one of her regular visits . She 's fairly young , with long brown hair and lovely , dark , Mediterranean eyes . She ran down a checklist , looking over each of the ninety-eight saurs , asking if any had been feeling ill , not getting enough to eat , subject to any changes in mood or behavior . Dr. Margaret is nothing if not thorough , and she has the necessary sense of humor one needs when dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Margaret holds her by the forelimbs and kisses her on the snout . That leaves Agnes speechless and , for the most part , agreeable . I mentioned Hetman 's nightmares to her , since Hetman would never mention them himself , along with my suspicion that he might be experiencing more pain . " Speaking of nightmares - " I thought about the night before but cut myself off . 11 - forget it . " It was " human stuff , " after all , like the coffee . Before Dr. Margaret was even two meters from his bed , Hetman called out , " My angel is here . How are you , Doctor ? " " How are you , old friend ? " She bent down and caressed his snout . " A little tired , " he answered . " A little sleepless . I do n't complain . When you come a miracle happens and I 'm instantly cured . " Did I mention that Dr. Margaret has a lovely blush ? She examined Hetman carefully and asked him if he might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not if they dull my senses . I have so few left . " " I 'll leave the prescription with Tom . You can try a half dose . If they 're too strong you do n't have to take them . " " Thank you . As long as I have angels here I 'm in no great hurry for heaven . " Dr. Margaret asked to see me in private , so we went up to my room . " I got another call from that researcher from Toyco . " " You too ? I 'd offer you some coffee but we 're almost out . " I went over to my desk but , like the visitor earlier , found myself reluctant to sit down . " Anyway , Toyco had their chance . I do n't see why they need any more samples . " Dr. Margaret sat on the top of my desk and stared out at the afternoon shadows in the yard . " I hear it has to do with the saurs " longevity . They 're back into immortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wonderful . " " Or it may be something else they had n't anticipated . " She spoke softly , as if we might be overheard . " Such as ? " " I saw Bronte 's egg . " I walked over to the window as if to stare out but I ca n't remember really looking at - or seeing - anything . I was recalling , for the first time in years , a trip I 'd taken with my mother , to one of the big , fancy department stores in one of the old  --  fashioned malls . Maybe it was something about Dr. Margaret that reminded me of my mother . In the toy section were about a dozen gray stegosaurs of Sluggo 's size housed in a colorful pen . The " Dinosaur Song " spilled out of speakers at each of the pen 's corners : " Yar-woooo ! Yar-woooo ! " The saurs huddled together apprehensively until a salesperson walked by and shouted at them . " Smile ! " she said . " No one 's going to buy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deliberate failures at the task , and when a little girl in blonde curls and a red coat picked up one of the saurs with her sweaty pink hand I clearly saw the expressions on the little gray faces , the one taken and the others remaining : the agony of loss and separation . When my mother noticed me looking at the saurs she gently tugged me away . " Forget it , Tommy . We could n't afford one in a million years and you 'd never take care of it anyway . Remember what happened to your iguana . " The first part did n't bother me . My parents were honest in their poverty and never used it as a crutch or a badge of honor . The second part hurt because I did my best to take care of the iguana . What hurt about it most was that my parents , fair as they were in many ways , could not help but remind me of my every failure and see in them the genetic imprint of my future . But what struck me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I ignored what she said . I looked up at her seriously , even with a bit of reproach , and told her , " I would n't buy one . I 'd buy them all , so they could stay together . " I took a little satisfaction , remembering that moment , in seeing past the delusion of those days , and proving my mother wrong . Not only could I take care of a sour , I could take care of ninety-eight of them . " Tom ? " Margaret waved her hand in front of my eyes . " Sorry . You were saying ? " " I said , there 's something else I 'm worried about . " " What 's that ? " " You , " she said , looking at me with all her medical precision . " You spend so much time here , with the saurs . I 'm not sure if that 's good for you . I 'm not sure it 's good for anyone . " She looked at me seriously , sadly , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that moment she reminded me even more of my mother , which made it even harder for me to answer . " I 'm happy here , Margaret . " I touched her hand . " I do n't know why . Any explanation I could give you beyond that would be something I made up . I feel at home here . I feel I 'm with friends . " Worry lines marred her forehead , which was the last thing I wanted , so I changed the subject back to my dwindling supply of coffee . If she continued to worry she never said a word about it to me . But I 'm still not sure if - when she showed me that grave expression - it was for something more than myself she worried . AFTER DINNER , some of the saurs sat in the living room , watching a production of Turandot on the video . Between acts , Axel demonstrated how to fall off a couch and onto a pillow , backwards , perhaps a few too many times . " Suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and time ! And I 'm **39;29;TOOLONG ! AAAAaaaahhh ! " During the finale of Turandot , some of the saurs joined in with the chorus - not that they knew the words , but they followed the melody with open vowels . In the library , The Five Wise Buddhasaurs took over the stereo and played Louis Armstrong recordings for several hours . They love his voice , his comet , and the sheer elation one finds in both . They 're convinced he 's one of them : a joyful saurian angel . Sluggo told the little ones some more tales of Sauria and the heroic voyages of the brave saurs who returned to their homeland . " And do you know why they sailed to Sauria ? " Agnes queried the little ones after the story . Those who could speak answered " Humans ! " mostly because that was the answer Agnes wanted to hear . " Humans ! " Agnes nodded . " Messing up everything ! Messing up the whole damn world ! " " Foo ! " the little ones chanted , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sat in the library , reading to Hetman and a few dozen saurs gathered around . The book was Hetman 's choice , The Deluge , by Henryk Sienkiewicz . " I wonder why they come . " Charlie interrupted my reading , still distracted by the morning visit . " What do they think they 're going to get ? Forgiveness ? Peace of mind ? Would n't they be happier if they forgot all about us ? I would . " " No , Charlie , " Hetman said , breathing heavily . " You do n't forget . As painful as the memories are , forgetting is dying . And , in the measure of all things , nothing that truly lives truly wants to die . " Later that evening , the storm clouds moved in . Even the most intelligent and reasonable of the saurs get unsettled by the lightning and thunder . Someone suggested jokingly that it was an ancient memory of the great comet , but if so then we all have a trace of that ancient memory . At bedtime all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones who get confused are aided by the bigger fellows . Even Hetman is brought up and wheeled over on his little bed . I check around for the stragglers and the lost under lamp tables , the bottom shelves of the bookcases , behind bedposts and in odd little comers . Every now and then , after I 've turned out the lights and crawled into my own bed , I 'll hear one that I 've missed crying out softly . I 'll follow the cries and find him or her - in the cabinet under the bathroom sink , stranded on the desk in the library - and carry the little one back to the bedroom . It 's true , just like in Andrew Ulaszek 's poem , " On the Island Where the Dinosaurs Live , " they sleep in a kind of huddle , the biggest in the center , the smaller ones crammed around them : " ... conjoined , in outlandish sprawl , a pile of plated backs , spiny heads and coiled tails . " Whether they do it to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem informs us , I can not know . The least social of them join in the huddle , even though there are many places to sleep in the old house . Tibor leaves his cardboard castle . Geraldine slips out of her secret laboratory . Doc , Diogenes , and Hubert take out the big blankets and comforters to spread over the amassed group . Bronte brought the egg up on a skate packed with cotton . That night , the house shook with each rumble of thunder . Bright blue flashes intruded through every window . I checked their bedroom before turning in . The blankets twitched with every flash of light . When I put my hand on them I could feel the shudders from underneath , like the erratic tremors of an old car engine . " I 'm all right , " - Agnes 's voice , stem , to cover her anxiety , as she pressed herself more closely to Sluggo . " It 's all right . It 's - I know it 's stupid . " " The thunder scares me too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help it . " I looked elsewhere , not wanting to add to her embarrassment . Charlie , with Rosie pressed against him , twitched in his sleep . Pierrot was rolled up in a little ball between Jean-Claude and Bronte . Tyrone wrapped his meager forearm around Alfie , who stared up with his huge , ever-frightened eyes as the terrible light bounced against the walls and brought the shadows to life . " Big storm ! " Axel smiled , mouth wide open as he trembled . " Big , big storm ! Everything blows up ! Brrroooommm ! " " For God 's sake - ! " Agnes groaned . " Yes . A very big storm . " I stroked Axel 's head until he lowered himself into the cushion of companions . " There is always fear , " Doc said , his smooth voice almost as deep as the thunder . " Yes , " I replied . " No matter how big the big ones get , there is always something bigger to fear . " " I know . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the low rumble of thunder . " Good night , my friend . " " Good night , my friend . " I went back to my bed but could n't fall asleep . The storm was fierce , with no sign of subsiding , but it was more than the light and noise that kept me up . I 'm not a morbid person , but I thought about death - or more precisely , how strangely tilted our view of life is . We know the universe went on before for billions of years and it will go on for billions more . There 's just this brief stretch when the window is opened before our eyes , and the world is visible . Then the window is shut , forever . I lay in bed , breathing short breaths , unable not to imagine my last moment . Will I scream in panic when it comes ? Or will I manage to utter one last farewell ? There was no getting past the " human stuff and it was all human stuff , from God to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . The thunder pealed and roared until I could hear the loose change on the dresser rattle with the vibrations . And then , from the saurs " room , I heard one voice . Perhaps Sluggo , perhaps Tyrone , perhaps a saur I would have least expected , but he or she sang one clear phrase with that nonsense dinosaur word : " Yar-woooo ! " And sang it again : " Yar-wooo ! " The third time , the other saurs joined in : a few at first , then more . It was the old song , the lullaby they had been trained and designed to sing in the innocent days when they sprang forth from the lab/factories . It reminded me of old fieldworkers singing slave songs generations after abolition . But even the most insubstantial melody can have a certain power . The urge to sing is stronger than any song . They were taught to sing it for their owners . Now they sang it for themselves . I listened as they sang against the unrelenting thunder , and then I joined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense dinosaur word - " Yar-wooo ! " " Yar-wooo ! " I sang with them until the thunder subsided and sleep took us all at last , even Axel .
