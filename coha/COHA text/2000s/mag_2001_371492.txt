I 'm writing this column while plugged into a gorgeously tactile white-and-chrome gadget the size of a cigarette pack that is giving me a better-than-CD-quality rendition of Hey Jude . For a music junkie like me , listening to tunes at work is not unusual . Listening on a portable device is . If this were a Discman or a regular M player , I would be fretting right now about how much battery power I was wasting , and I would certainly have to hunt for another album before I reached the end of this page . But this tiny beauty , known as an iPod , has put 12 hours of juice and 1,200 tunes at my fingertips , which means I can go get groceries , clean the house , work out , cook dinner , finish a novel and go to bed without thinking of taking the headphones off . After an early-morning recharge , I can start over . <P> If you own a Macintosh , you have permission to get excited . Apple starts selling the $399 iPod this week . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all of them . FireWire is such a blazingly fast and useful connection , it can download a hundred songs a minute and recharge the iPod at the same time . Even better , iPod is smart enough to know when you have put new M files on your Mac  --  from your CDs or from the Internet  --  and upload them automatically . <P> Apple excels at this kind of so-simple-it's-brilliant stuff . Steve Jobs may be a few years late to the MP3-player race , but with iPod he has shot into the lead . No one else has this much storage in a package this small . Never has digital music been this well organized . The trackwheel on the front scolls quickly and precisely through all your songs , arranged by title or by artist , and the display is crisp and readable . When I gave the iPod to my techno-suspicious parents , they figured out how to select and play in under a minute . Why ca n't all gadgets be like that ? <P> If you are part of the PC-owning majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jobs has not ruled out producing Windows-compatible versions of iPod , but making tools for operating systems other than his own has never been his style . Better to hope iPod shakes up the M industry the way the iMac shook up the makers of boxy beige PCs . There will probably be lots of generic cut-price , cross-platform knock-offs of the iPod by Christmas 2002 . <P> Meanwhile , there are more than enough Mac users in the world for Apple to make out like a bandit this holiday season . There really are no downsides to the iPod other than its relatively weighty price tag . It would be nice to see that lowered soon , although the Mac universe is an expensive place to begin with . If price does turn out to be no object , expect Jobs to capitalize on his " digital hub " strategy with a few more Apple-only peripherals : the iCamera , perhaps , or the iOrganizer . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have some Beatles-inspired housework I need to get to . <P> Go to  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
