<p> BATON ROUGE , LA. - People start walking out of the darkness in a quiet neighborhood east of downtown about 4 a.m. , stamping their feet against the chill and drawing deeply on last-minute cigarettes . <p> The transit center has a coffee shop , but it 's not open yet . And most of the travelers just want to get on the bus , put their heads back and sleep away the two-hour trip to New Orleans . <p> This is what it takes to work in New Orleans for a lot of the city 's displaced residents living in Baton Rouge . Get up in the darkness , ride one of the free Federal Emergency Management Agency buses for two hours , work your shift , get back on the bus for another two hours and arrive home in the evening darkness . <p> It 's grueling . Some of the riders do n't know how long they can take it . Others say they 're willing to endure the commute for a wage they could n't earn in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new start for me , " explained Devoy Copper , 40 . " I 'm just taking advantage of everything on the table right now . " <p> Copper moved in with his mother in Baton Rouge after his home in New Orleans East was destroyed in the flooding . He started riding the bus into New Orleans a few days after Thanksgiving and found work on a FEMA cleanup crew , but he does n't want to move back . <p> " I do n't even feel the same about it . That 's why I 'm trying to find a house here , " Copper said . " What was is no more , and never will be again . <p> " I still love the city , but something is missing . " <p> A few seats over , Bourdette Fouchia , 54 , stared out the window as the early darkness started to lift . <p> She and her family evacuated from her home in Lakeview before the water took it , but they could n't escape New Orleans for three nightmarish days . Fouchia ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floodwaters in an inflatable raft . <p> " We got out in a stolen U-Haul trailer , " she said flatly . <p> Fouchia considers herself blessed to have landed in Baton Rouge . <p> " Right now I 'm living in a nice neighborhood in a nice house , " she said . But life does not feel normal . <p> " Not at all , " Fouchia said . " I still feel like I 'm lost . " <p> It makes her sad to go back into the city for her job with a nonprofit organization that specialized in beautification projects before the storm . And it makes her sad when her little granddaughter begs her to skip the bus and stay home so they can spend time together . <p> " I really do n't know how long I can keep doing this commute , " she said . " I think I need therapy , " she added a few minutes later . <p> 16,000 free rides <p> FEMA has provided more than 16,000 free bus rides for workers since late October , and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one seems to know what will happen after then . <p> It 's not always a round trip . On a recent weekday , 326 people rode from Baton Rouge and 314 rode back . Sometimes people miss the last bus , sometimes they stay in New Orleans a few days to work . <p> And while the service was set up to help evacuees , plenty of longtime Baton Rouge residents ride the buses for higher paying jobs . <p> Displaced New Orleans resident Frank Fulco , 44 , has a car , but the drive that took an hour before Katrina is now a two-hour trip in nerve-jangling stop-and-go traffic . <p> " The traffic is so much worse now because everybody is commuting , " said Fulco , a banker with two school-age children . Fulco 's home in St. Bernard Parish was destroyed , and he thinks he 'd eventually like to move his family inland , across Lake Pontchartrain . <p> Family members who lived in four households before the storm now share a home they pooled their money to buy in Baton Rouge . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary . <p> Two hours , 15 minutes <p> When the bus finally pulls into downtown New Orleans , two hours and 15 minutes after leaving Baton Rouge , people yawn , stretch and stagger for the door . Devoy Copper needs to make a connection to City Park on the other side of town to report for work on a biohazard cleanup crew picking bleach bottles and household cleaners out of debris piles . <p> It 's nasty work , and there 's that four-hour commute . But Copper says he 's up for it . <p> " As long as I make $14.25 an hour , seven days a week ! " <p> But when he arrived at City Park on a recent midweek morning , Copper learned he was being transferred to a crew doing asbestos cleanup . It would require different training , a bulky suit and a filtered breathing apparatus . <p> Killing time before his training session , Copper fielded several phone calls from a friend from his old neighborhood in New Orleans whom he described , euphemistically , as being in " street sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your business in order " and follow him back to New Orleans for a real job . <p> " I tell people , man , you do n't have to do all that craziness anymore , " Copper said . " Everything is brand new . " <p> When Copper returned for some training , he was fitted with a bulky purple breathing apparatus , a one-piece white coverall and a color-coded vest . He was told to report for his assignment the next day and not to worry - he 'd still draw his pay . <p> Managing a smile <p> Joining his new crew about 24 hours later , Copper struggled into his white suit , stood up after wrestling with various zippers and announced , " It 's hot . " <p> The workers piled into cars and headed for New Orleans East . <p> What used to be a comfortable , middle-class neighborhood not far from Copper 's is partially inhabited now and strewn with pieces of asbestos roofing material . <p> The motley work crew got long , repetitive introductory speeches from two supervisors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask on at all times ! " ) and warned that they 'd be fired if they disturbed private property . <p> Shovels , brooms and bags were handed out , as well as water for moistening roofing tiles to prevent asbestos dust from flying when they were collected . <p> " Has anyone done flag duty before ? " the supervisor asked . <p> Copper put up his hand , took the flag , and was directed to stand a good 20 feet ahead of any asbestos work . <p> But he did n't get to ditch the hot suit or the constricting mask . He smiled wanly as he began waving the occasional car through the work zone . <p> ... <p> DEVOY COPPER 'S DAILY COMMUTE <p> 4 a.m . ..
