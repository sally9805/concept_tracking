Temple <br> <br> From her arrival at the docks to the appearance of Roger 's letter , written on crisp Ministry paper and signed with his full name , on her maid 's silver tray at breakfast , three months had passed . On that morning , her poached eggs steaming their silver bowl ( gelatinous , gleaming ) , Miss Temple had not seen Roger Bascombe for seven days . He had been called to Brussels . Then to the country house of his infirm uncle , Lord Tarr . Then he had been required at all hours by the Minister , and then by the Deputy Minister , and finally by a pressing request from a cousin desperate for discreet advice about matters of property and law . But then she found herself in the same tea shop as that same cousin-the over-fed , over-wigged Pamela  --  exactly when Roger was said to be soothing her distress . It was quite clear that Pamela 's only source of disquiet was a less than ready supply of buns . Miss Temple began to feel tremulous . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth day , at breakfast , she received the letter from Roger regretfully severing their engagement , closing with the politely expressed desire that she take pains to never contact nor see him in any way for the complete remainder of her days . It contained no other explanation . <br> Such rejection had quite simply never occurred to her . The manner of dismissal she barely noticed  --  indeed , it was just how she would have done such a thing ( as in fact , she had , on multiple galling occasions )  --  but the fact of it was stinging . She had attempted to re-read the letter , but found her vision blurred  --  after a moment she realized she was in tears . She dismissed the maid and unsuccessfully attempted to butter a slice of toast . She placed the toast and her knife carefully on the table , stood , and then walked rather hurriedly to her bed , where she curled into a tight ball , the entirety of her small frame shaking with silent sobs . <br> For an entire day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even that watered down ( without milk or lemon ) into a thin , rusty beverage that managed to be both feeble and unpleasant . In the night she wept again , alone in the dark , hollow and unmoored , until her pillow was too damp to be borne . But by the next afternoon , her clear grey eyes ringed red and her sausage curls lank , waking in pallid winter light ( a season quite new to the warm-blooded Miss Temple , who judged it objectively horrid ) , the bedding tangled about her , she was once more determined to be about her business , and brisk . <br> Her world had been changed  --  as she was willing to admit ( she had a young lady 's classical education ) did happen in life  --  but it hardly meant she was obliged to be docile , for Miss Temple was only docile on the most extraordinary occasions . Indeed , she was considered by some a provincial savage if not an outright little monster , for she was not large , and was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright and hot , in the shadow of slaves , and as she was a sensitive girl , it had marked her like a whip  --  though part of that marking was how very immune from whips she was , and would , she trusted , remain . <br> Miss Temple was twenty-five , old to be unmarried , but as she had spent some time disappointing available suitors on her island before being sent across the sea to sophisticated society , this was not necessarily held against her . She was as wealthy as plantations could make her , and sharp-witted enough to know that it was natural for people to care more for her money than for her person , and she did not take this point of materialist interest to heart . Indeed , she took very little to heart at all . The exception  --  though she found herself now hard-pressed to explain it , and though lacking explanations of any kind vexed her  --  was Roger . <br> Miss Temple had rooms at the Hotel Boniface , fashionable but not ridiculous , consisting of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dressing room , a sleeping room , a room for her two maids , and a second dressing and sleeping room for her aged Aunt Agathe , who lived on a small plantation-derived stipend , and who generally alternated between meals and slumber but was enough respected to be a suitable chaperone , despite her lack of attention . Agathe , whom Miss Temple had only first met upon her disembarkation , was acquainted with the Bascombe family . Quite simply , Roger was the first man of reasonable status and beauty to whom Miss Temple had been introduced , and being a young woman of clarity and loyalty , she found no further reason to search . For his part , Roger gave every impression of finding her both pretty and delightful , and so they were engaged . <br> To all accounts it was a good match . Roger 's expressed opinion aside , even those who found Miss Temple 's directness difficult would admit to her adequate beauty . They would also happily admit to her wealth . Roger Bascombe was a rising figure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a man who looked fine when well-dressed , displayed no flagrant vice , and who possessed more chin and less stomach than any the Bascombes had produced in two generations . Their time together had been brief but , to Miss Temple 's experience , intense . They had shared a dizzying variety of meals , strolled through parks and galleries , gazed deeply into each other 's eyes , exchanged tender kisses . All of this had been new to her , from the restaurants and the paintings ( the scale and strangeness of which prompted Miss Temple to sit for several minutes with a hand pressed tightly over each eye ) , the variety of people , of smells , the music , the noise , the manners and all the new words , and further to the particular strength of Roger 's fingers , his arm around her waist , his kindly chuckle  --  which even when she felt it came at her expense she strangely did not mind  --  and his own smells , of his soap , his hair oil , his tobacco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ink and wax and wood varnish and felt-topped tables , and finally the , to her mind , devastating mixture of sensations she derived from his delicate lips , his bristling side whiskers , and his warm searching tongue . <br> But by Miss Temple 's next breakfast , though her face was blotched and swollen about the eyes , she met her eggs and toast with customary ferocity , and met the maid 's timorous gaze just once with a narrow peremptory glance that served as a knife drawn across the throat of any speech , much less consolation . Agathe was still asleep . Miss Temple had been aware ( from the husky , insistent , violet-scented breathing ) that her aunt had lingered on the opposite side of her door through the day of her ( as she now thought of it ) Dark Retreat , but she wanted no part of that conversation either . <br> She launched herself out of the Boniface , wearing a simple but frankly quite flattering green and gold flowered dress , with green leather ankle boots and a green bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the streets on the near bank of the river . She was not interested in actively buying anything , but had the idea that looking at the assembled goods of the city  --  of the world  --  making their way from so many different lands to this collection of shops might serve as a spur to new thinking about her own new state of affairs . With this in mind , she found herself eager , even restless , moving from stall to stall , her eyes roving without lingering over fabrics , carved boxes , glassware , hats , trinkets , gloves , silks , perfumes , papers , soaps , opera glasses , hairpins , feathers , beads , and lacquered items of all kinds . At no point did she actually stop , and sooner than she had imagined possible Miss Temple found herself on the district 's other side , standing at the edge of St. Isobel 's Square . <br> The day above her was a cloudy grey . She turned and retraced her steps , gazing still more intently into each exotic display , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding the item that would hook her attention into place . On the Boniface side again , she wondered exactly what she thought she was doing . How , if she was with clarity embracing her new sense of loss and redefinition , did nothing  --  not even an especially cunning lacquered duck  --  generate interest ? Instead , at each object , she felt herself driven onward , prey to some nagging urge she could not name , toward some unknown prize . That she had no conscious idea what this prize might be irked her , but she took comfort from the implication that it did exist , and would be potent enough to alert her when it came into view . <br> So , with a resolute sigh , she crossed back through the shops for a third time , her attention entirely elsewhere , confident , as she crossed the square toward the nest of monumental white stone buildings that made up the government Ministries , that her interest was  --  in a word  --  disinterested . The matter lay not so much with the perceived faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived superiority , if any , of a rival ( whose identity she was , out of idle curiosity alone , in the back of her mind trying to guess ) , but merely that her own case was the best example at hand . Or was it the only example ? Still , it did not mean she was troubled by it , or that she 'd no perspective , or that for any future affections of the now-beyond-her Roger Bascombe she would give two pins . <br> Despite these absolutely rational thoughts , Miss Temple paused upon reaching the center of the square , and instead of continuing on to the buildings where Roger was undoubtedly even now at work , she sat on a wrought-metal bench and looked up at the enormous statue of St. Isobel at the square 's center . Knowing nothing of the sainted martyr and in no way devout , Miss Temple was merely disquieted by its vulgar extravagance : a woman clinging to a barrel in surging surf , clothes torn , hair wild , ringed by the flotsam of shipwreck , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle of serpents that wrapped around her flailing limbs , coiled under her garments and wound across her throat even as she opened her mouth to cry to heaven  --  a cry one saw to be heard by a pair of angels , winged , robed , and impassively gazing down from above Isobel 's head . Miss Temple appreciated enough the size of the thing and the technical achievements involved , but it nevertheless struck her as coarse and unlikely . Shipwreck , as an island girl , she could accept , as she could martyrdom by snakes , but the angels seemed fatiguingly presumptuous . <br> Of course , as she looked into the unseeing stone eyes of the forever serpent-beset Isobel , she knew she could have scarcely cared less . Her gaze finally followed her true interest , toward the nest of white buildings , and so , quickly , she formed a plan , and with each step of that plan , a perfectly sound justification . She accepted that she was forever divided from Roger  --  persuasion and reunion were no part of her aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was information . Was it strict rejection alone  --  that Roger would rather be alone than be burdened with her ? Was it a matter of personal ambition  --  that she must be shunted aside in favor of promotion and responsibility ? Was there simply another woman who had supplanted her in his affections ? Or was there something else that she could not presently imagine ? They were all equal in her mind , of neutral emotional value , but crucial as far as Miss Temple 's ability to situate herself in her new loss-inflected existence . <br> It would be simple enough to follow him . Roger was a man of habits , and even when his hours of work were irregular he would still take his mid-day meal , whenever he did take it , at the same restaurant . Miss Temple found an antiquarian book shop across the street where , as she was obliged to purchase something for standing so long watching through its window , she on impulse selected a complete four-volume Illustrated Lives of Sea Martyrs . The books were detailed enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining the colored plates , while actually watching Roger first enter and then , after an hour , re-emerge , alone , from the heavy doors across the street . He walked straight back into the Ministry courtyard . Miss Temple arranged for her purchase to be delivered to the Boniface , and walked back into the street , feeling like a fool . <br> She had re-crossed the square before her reason convinced her that she was not so much a fool as an inexperienced observer . It was pointless to watch from outside the restaurant . It was only from inside that she could have determined whether or not Roger dined alone , or with others , or with which particular others , with any of whom he might have shared significant words  --  all crucial information . Further , unless he had merely thrown her over for his work  --  which she doubted , scoffing  --  she was like to learn nothing from observing his working day . It was after work , obviously , that any real intelligence would be gathered . Abruptly , for by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shops , she entered a store whose windows were thick with all shapes of luggage , hampers , oilskins , gaiters , pith helmets , lanterns , telescopes , and a ferocious array of walking sticks . She emerged some time later , after exacting negotiations , wearing a ladies ' black traveling cloak , with a deep hood and several especially cunning pockets . A visit to another shop filled one pocket with opera glasses , and a visit to a third weighed down a second pocket with a leatherbound notebook and an all-weather pencil . Miss Temple then took her tea . <br> Between cups of Darjeeling and two scones slathered with cream she made opening entries in the notebook , prefacing her entire endeavor and then detailing the day 's work so far . That she now had a kind of uniform and a set of tools made everything that much easier and much less about her particular feelings , for tasks requiring clothes and accoutrements were by definition objective , even scientific , in nature . In keeping with this , she made a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing proper names and places with synonyms or word-play that hopefully would be impenetrable to all but herself ( all references to the Ministry were to " Minsk " or even just " Russia " , and Roger himself  --  in a complex train of thought that started with him as a snake that had shed his skin , to a snake being charmed by the attractions of others , to India , and finally , because of his still-remarkable personal presence  --  became " the Rajah " ) . Against the possibility that she might be making her observations for some time and in some discomfort , she ordered a sausage roll for later . It was placed on her table , wrapped in thick waxed paper , and presently bundled into another pocket of her cloak . <br> Continues ...
