Love makes the world go round , but it can also send drama spiraling right down the drain . The recollection of someone loved too well and too uncritically can bury a filmed memoir in Hallmark emotion . Writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson courts this danger in the autobiographical Lackawanna Blues ( HBO , Feb. 12 , 8 p.m . E.T. ) and escapes  --  barely . <P> Adapted and expanded from Santiago-Hudson 's 2001 one-man stage show , Blues recalls his childhood in an upstate New York boardinghouse in the 1950s and ' 60s . His surrogate mother , Rachel ( Nanny ) Crosby ( S. Epatha Merkerson ) , gives an ersatz family of wayward , mostly African-American drifters shelter , hot meals and toughlove . The youngest is little Ruben ( an astute Marcus Carl Franklin ) , whom Nanny delivers in an upstairs room , then takes in when neither of his young parents proves mature enough to raise him . <P> " That would n't be the last time Nanny came to my rescue , " says Ruben ( played , as an adult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from the narration 's sentimental bent  --  through Merkerson 's strong , smart and earthy performance . Nanny is essentially a professional crisis manager , defusing fights , shooing off troublemakers and healing broken souls with sugar and steel . She 's part social worker , part cop and all heart . <P> Theater producer-director George C. Wolfe , directing his first film , took Blues to the stage , and here he adds a vast cast and a kinetic style . He has gathered a stellar ensemble , including Santiago-Hudson as well as Delroy Lindo , Louis Gossett Jr . and Jeffrey Wright , as the various misfits who pass on their stories to Ruben . <P> Blues is n't a narrative so much as a series of vignettes and Emmy-clip speeches  --  a jam session of 12-bar vamps . But each player makes his or her bit sing in a raucous , syncopated valentine to an oddball community , to black culture and to mother love itself .  --  By James Poniewozik                 @ @ @ @
