<p> Gus Suhr played with Paul Waner , played for Pie Traynor and thought Honus Wagner was " a prince of a guy . " <p> Those three legendary Hall of Famers are long gone , but Suhr is still around . A star first baseman for the San Francisco Seals even before Seals Stadium was built and a subsequent All-Star for the Pittsburgh Pirates , Suhr , 97 , who moved to Scottsdale four years ago after 56 years in Millbrae , is the fourth-oldest living former major-league player . <p> Only Paul Hopkins , 98 , ( pitcher , Senators , Browns 1927 , 1929 ) ; Billy Rogell , 98 ( shortstop , Red Sox , Tigers , Cubs 1927-40 ) and Ray Cunningham , 98 ( third baseman , Cardinals , 1931-32 ) are older than Suhr , who was born in San Francisco on Jan. 3 , 1906 . <p> Despite his advanced years , Suhr still has his mobility , a good deal of his hair , and his appetite . He walked last week from a parking lot to a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing height by only the hint of a stoop . He proceeded to polish off a plate of bacon , eggs and potatoes while talking pre-World War II baseball between bites . <p> Suhr grew up in San Francisco , signed a professional contract while still in his teens , and after some stops in the lower minors , was acquired by the hometown Seals in 1927 . Seals Stadium was still a dream then , and the team played at Recreation Park at 15th and Valencia streets . It held 16,500 fans , but not many of Suhr 's baseballs . " I liked that park , " Suhr says now . " Short right-field porch . " <p> In 1929 , Suhr hit 51 home runs , a figure that would stand as the franchise record through the team 's last year in 1957 . In fact , Suhr had some astounding numbers in 1929 , the most impressive being 202 games played . " We played a lot of games back then , " he said . " The owners had to make money . " <p> SHOUTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's son , Gus Jr. , the elder Suhr played every inning that year , a remarkable feat that did n't wear him down . He hit .381 with 299 hits , 62 doubles , 177 RBIs and 196 runs scored . <p> One of the favorite vantage points of Recreation Park was the " Booze Cage , " a section of field-level seating that ran along the third-base line . A " cage " of chicken wire was all that separated the fans from the players . And while it held the rowdy spectators back , their taunts made it through . <p> " You walked along 90 feet from the dugout to the bat , " Suhr told author Jerry Flamm in the book , " Good Life in Hard Times . " " If you were going bad , they 'd ride you . ' Where were you last night , Suhr , drinking up ? Suhr , you 're a bum . ' " <p> Although this was during Prohibition , the name Booze Cage endured , having been born prior to 1919 when 75 cents not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to either a shot of whiskey , two bottles of beer or a ham and cheese sandwich . <p> FINANCIAL WINDFALL <p> Suhr was sold to the Pirates following the 1929 season for $50,000 and he got to keep $1,000 of that for himself . That sum was quite a windfall for Suhr . <p> " I think the most money I ever made in a season was $12,000 , " Suhr said , and he made it clear he is not bemoaning the fact he was born too early to really cash in . " We bought a new Buick every year , " he said . " That was a pretty big thing . " <p> With the Pirates , Suhr joined a cast that was filled with Hall of Famers . " Pie Traynor was on the downside of his career when I got there , " Suhr said . " Still , he had a couple of pretty good years and then was the manager ( 1934-39 ) . He was good to play for , smart . " <p> Both Waner brothers , Paul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time in Pittsburgh . They finished their respective careers with lifetime batting averages well over .300 , but they did it naturally . " They did n't study pitchers , did n't take any extra batting practice . They just went up there and hit , " Suhr said . <p> Honus Wagner , the legendary Pirates shortstop of the early years of the 20th century , had retired more than a decade before Suhr arrived in Pittsburgh . However , he was still around the Pirates as a coach . " He was one of my favorites , always willing to help , " Suhr said . <p> ALL-STAR IN 1936 <p> Although not quite up to the performance level of some of his more illustrious teammates , Suhr certainly was a top-flight player . He established the National League record of 822 consecutive games played , a streak that was halted only so Suhr could attend his mother 's funeral . That mark stood until Stan Musial broke it in the 1960s , and it is still the ninth best of all time . <p> His best year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was selected to the All-Star team that year , but did not get into the game . He did n't want to discuss it , but the hurt in his expression revealed this was a slight that has lasted nearly 70 years . <p> He also never played in a World Series . The Pirates had three second-place finishes during Suhr 's time there , 1932 , 1933 and 1938. " 1938 was a year we almost won it , " Suhr said . " But the Cubs went on a big winning streak . " The Pirates finished two games behind Chicago . <p> Suhr was playing first base the day Babe Ruth hit the final three home runs of his career in Pittsburgh in 1935 . " The last one he really hit a long way , " Suhr said . " When he came around first base I said , ' Nice going , Babe . ' " <p> A lifetime .279 hitter with 84 homers and 818 RBIs in 1,435 games , Suhr said of all the pitchers he faced , he had the most trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with that screwball , " Suhr said . " But I did pretty well against Dizzy Dean . " <p> A fine fielder , Suhr had a distinctive way of dealing with foul pop-ups . " I would catch them behind my head , like this , " he said , cupping his hands just above the back of his head . " The only time I ever dropped one was in Philadelphia , and they booed me , " he said . " Fortunately , we won the game . " <p> SHREWD MONEY MANAGER <p> Suhr had been traded to the Phillies midway through the 1939 season and retired early in 1940 . He returned to the Bay Area and wound up playing with the Seals from 1943-45 . " Those were the war years , " he said , dismissively . <p> Still , he led the PCL in doubles in ' 44 with 36 and averaged .311 in 1945 . By that time the team was in Seals Stadium , which was not a home-run park , measuring an unforgiving 380 feet down the right-field line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to live well because of shrewd money management . He moved to Arizona to be near his son . " I like it here , " he said . " But I 'll take San Francisco . " <p> He returned to Pittsburgh last year when the Pirates honored many of their alumni on the occasion of opening their new ballpark . " He got a big hand , " Gus Jr . said . " I think the next oldest was Bob Friend , who played in the 1950s . " <p> STILL SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS <p> Suhr still follows baseball , although his in-person attendance has been limited to a Pirates ' visit to Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix . <p> " People still send him things to autograph , and he 'll sign them , " Gus Jr . said . <p> While he was an active player , Suhr said , the demand for autographs had not reached today 's frenetic level , but he did willingly oblige . One of his early signatures was on a baseball owned by a Daly City youngster named John Madden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding that the once treasured baseball had long since disappeared . Suhr 's granddaughter Linda Miller heard Madden 's lament , got Grandpa to sign a ball and delivered it to Madden 's office . <p> Madden mentioned it on the air , a tale that brings a smile to Senior 's face . <p> Oldest living former players <p> The three former major-league players older than Gus Suhr : <p> Paul Hopkins ( born Sept. 25 , 1904 ) Pitched in 1927 and 1929 with the Washington Senators and St. Louis Browns . Was 1-1 in 11 career games with a 2.96 ERA . Made one major-league start . In 27 2/3 innings he gave up 28 hits and walked 15 . <p> Billy Rogell ( born Nov. 24 , 1904 ) Primarily a shortstop , he played for the Red Sox ( 1925-28 ) , the Tigers ( 1930-39 ) and the Cubs ( 1940 ) . In 1,482 games , he hit .267 with 256 doubles , 75 triples , 42 homers , 755 runs and 609 RBIs .
