San Antonio , the Present <p> <p> " But you made it , " Rita Navarro , director of the Survivor Center for Victims of Torture , said from behind her desk , after Caitlin had left her story off with being felled by the second bullet . <p> <p> " Barely , " Caitlin told her . <p> <p> " And the other Ranger , Charlie Weeks ? " <p> <p> " He did n't make it . " <p> <p> Navarro slid back slightly from the edge of her desk chair , checking the rTsumTbefore her again as if in search of new information . The light in her cramped office , once a treatment room in the clinic that had formerly occupied this building , came from ceiling- mounted , overly bright fluorescents . But natural light was n't an option since the room 's windows had been frosted over by a thick layer of dust and grime . Sometime during the transition from clinic to treatment center , the building had been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair requiring more funds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to have had the opportunity to meet you , Ranger Strong  --  " <p> <p> " I 'm not a Ranger anymore . " <p> <p> "  --  but what exactly are you doing here ? We never advertised for a security specialist . " " No , you advertised for a counselor and therapist . That 's what I 'm applying for . " <p> <p> " Oh , " Navarro said dismissively , and flipped to the second page of the rTsumT . She was younger than Caitlin had expected . Her name suggested a Hispanic heritage , but Caitlin thought she detected some Native American , Commanche probably , in her peaked cheekbones , narrow jaw and straight dark hair that dropped to the midpoint of her back . She had an engaging smile that Caitlin had so far glimpsed only upon exchanging a quick handshake , finding Navarro 's firm and slightly callused , evidence of a woman who liked to garden in her free time . <p> <p> Caitlin crossed her legs , then uncrossed them . The stiffness of the wood chair forced her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was beginning to regret her decision to swap her jeans for pressed light cotton slacks . The jeans did a better job of accentuating her curves and making her long legs stand out less . At five foot nine she had her father 's height and grandfather 's short torso , a model 's body she 'd often been told before adding substantial muscle to her frame with regular weight lifting workouts . Her wavy auburn hair was the longest it had ever been , tumbling just past her shoulders . Besides the hair , Caitlin looked no different than she had five years before . Maybe she was trying to freeze time going back to that night in the West Texas desert near the Mexican border . Do that and maybe she could figure out how to make it run backward too . <p> <p> She still got out in the sun a lot , leaving her skin drier and tighter than she 'd prefer . But her complexion was smooth and dark , the rosy cheeks she 'd been teased about as a child staying with her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went back to college and got a master 's in psychiatric social ser vices , " Caitlin explained . " Got myself certified in crisis management and intervention . Nice complement to my undergraduate degree in sociology . " <p> <p> Navarro went back to the first page . " You were , let 's see , seven years with the highway patrol before you joined the Rangers . " <p> <p> " You need at least that much ser vice with the Texas Department of Public Safety before the Rangers will even consider you . " <p> <p> " I understand only one of every hundred applicants actually makes it . " <p> <p> " Something like that . Since I was the one I did n't give it much thought . " <p> <p> Strong Enough to Die <p> <p> " Family tradition , it seems . " <p> <p> " Yes , ma'am . My granddad was the last of the real gunslingers . Took down a gang that had robbed four banks in the street outside number five . " <p> <p> " By himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of coffee in the diner across the way . My dad could hit the bull's-eye with his pistol from a hundred yards nine times out of ten . And my great- granddad and great , great- granddad took part in some of the most famous Ranger campaigns in history . " <p> <p> " The Mexican War being one of them . " <p> <p> " That 'd be my great , great- granddad . He was there all right , fighting skirmishes on both sides of the Rio Grande . What makes you ask ? " <p> <p> Navarro tapped her desk with her index fingers , flashing a look that suggested she was leaving something unsaid . " I looked you up on the Internet . Seems like you were in the pro cess of making your own legend with the Rangers . " <p> <p> " Not really . " <p> <p> " But you took down the man they called the most dangerous in all of Texas . McMasters or something . " " Masters . Cort Wesley Masters . " " You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an arrest . I made dozens of those . " " Only female Ranger ever , is that right ? " " There 've been a few others , but it never quite worked out , ma'am . " " I imagine it could be a tough job for a woman . " " Well , truth be told , it 's a tough job for anyone , but it 's a lot to ask of a woman , especially , to ride into some Texas town been doing things a certain way for a long while and tell the elected sheriff that you 're the resident Ranger on a case he thought he was in charge of . " <p> <p> " Did n't seem to bother you much with this Masters . " <p> <p> " I had some luck , ma'am . " <p> <p> Navarro let it go at that , passing Caitlin a faint smile that said she knew there was plenty more to the story . Caitlin was grateful , in no particular mood to rehash her near gunfight with the most feared man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not back . <p> <p> Navarro studied the pages again , less cursorily this time , no longer feigning interest . " You received a commendation for what happened at the border , saving your partner and all . " <p> <p> " I did n't save him for long . " <p> <p> " Special Medal for Valor , it says here . " <p> <p> " I did n't deserve it . " <p> <p> " Why ? " <p> <p> " Because we got ambushed . Seems all wrong getting rewarded for being ambushed . " " You left the Rangers on your own ? " " I did , ma'am . " " Not on disability , it says here . " " I was n't disabled . " " Six months after the gunfight in which you were wounded . " " There was the hospital stay . " " Two months , " Navarro said , after consulting the pages before her , <p> <p> " to treat two primary bullet wounds . " " Something like that .
