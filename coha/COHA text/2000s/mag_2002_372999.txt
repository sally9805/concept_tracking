LOOK MA , NO PC ! Until now , adding new music to your M player meant plugging the device into your computer and transferring songs off the hard drive . But next-generation audio players like the Digisette DUO-DX E-Cassette ( $189 ) can record songs directly from a stereo system without computer software  --  or , for that matter , a computer . Just pop the DUO-DX into a stereo tape deck , hit the record button and automatically convert CDs , tapes or radio tunes into M files . <P> NOTHING BUT NET Because this year 's World Cup soccer tournament is being held in Japan and South Korea on the other side of the world , most of the matches do n't appear on U.S. TV until the wee hours of the morning . Happily for soccer junkies , there is no shortage of websites competing to fill the void with up-to-the-minute scores , running commentary and even a few video highlights .
