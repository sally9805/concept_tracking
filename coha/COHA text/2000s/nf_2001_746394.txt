The team building intervention program utilized in the present case stud ) , is a field-tested version of a " bands-on " approach conceptualized by Yukelson ( 1997 ) . The framework behind the intervention program consisted of the following components : shared vision , role clarity-acceptance , strong leadership , individual/team accountability , team identity , and open/honest communication . The intervention program was delivered to two Division I women 's soccer teams . On a team b ) , team basis , the specific intervention programs and the consultant 's delivery of said programs were evaluated to determine the degree to which each intervention contributed to team unity and performance , the two primary goals of the intervention . A valid , reliable evaluation inventor ) , the Consultant Evaluation Form ( CEF ; Partington &; Orlick , 1987 ) , was utilized to achieve the program evaluation objectives . Overall , the results demonstrated that both of the teams rated the team building intervention as being " helpful " in enhancing individual performance ( means of 2.8 and 3.1 , respectively ) , " very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3.9 , respectively ) , and " very helpful " in improving team unity ( means of 3.1 and 3.5 , respectively ) . In addition , recommendations for future intervention effectiveness research are also discussed <p> The team building model utilized as a framework for the current field-based study was devised by Yukelson ( 1997 ) . This model was used in the current study due to its direct service approach conceptualized via prior team building research , applied techniques , and interviews with coaches and athletes from Penn State University . The framework behind the team building intervention program consisted of the following components : ( a ) shared vision ( consisting of common goals and complimentary roles ) ; ( b ) collaborative and synergistic teamwork ; ( c ) individual-team accountability ; ( d ) team identity ; ( e ) positive team culture and cohesiveness ; ( f ) open and honest communication . The seven stages of team building , which represent general implementation procedures , were as follows : <p> Stage One : A formal needs assessment is conducted by coaches ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what does this team need to do to be successful ? <p> Stage Two : Using this information , coaches ( and consultant if needed ) develop a specific plan , addressing how they can get the team to improve upon these needs . <p> Stage Three : An initial team meeting is conducted between the team and coaches ; the meeting consists of an educational orientation about what team building is , and then the coach can facilitate brainstorming sessions on what this team needs to do to be successful ( coaches list their comments and those from the players on a blackboard or equivalent ) . <p> Stage Four : The team prioritizes their input ( most important needs ) , and then additional brainstorming is conducted to define each point , and how it can be assessed and accounted for . <p> Stage Five : Follow-up meetings can be conducted to develop short/long range goals and action plans ( how do we plan on achieving these goals ? ) . <p> Stage Six : Follow-up meetings can include evaluation of team 's progress on their standards and goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolutely critical to provide feedback/evaluation to the players for the intervention to have maximal effect . <p> Stage Seven : Team meetings can then be setup to deal with conflicts which may occur during the season . <p> Effective teamwork can often be the difference between success and failure . This can be exemplified by the paradox whereby teams full of talented players fail to use their individual resources and fall short of standards , while teams with less talent and resources are successful and exceed their expectations ( Hardy &; Crace , 1997 ) . Effective teamwork has been conceptualized as : ( a ) taking advantage of the various abilities and backgrounds of its members ; ( b ) interacting and working toward shared goals ; ( c ) balancing the needs of the team with the needs of the individual members ; ( d ) structuring methods of communication ( Carron &; Prapavessis , 1997 ; Crace &; Hardy , 1997 ; Carton , Spink , &; Prapavessis , 1997 ; Yukelson , 1997 ) . To assist athletes , coaches , and teams in enhancing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to positively effect team processes and team performance has been utilized called team building . <p> What has not been adequately addressed in the coaching and sport psychology literature is how to effectively implement and evaluate the effectiveness of psychological skill training programs ( Cogan &; Petrie , 1995 ; Vealey , 1988 ) . Thus , the major purpose of this article is to detail the implementation of a team building intervention model with two university soccer teams . Another purpose of this article is to present the study results on the effectiveness of the team building intervention model in terms of improving team unity and performance . Based upon Yukelson 's propositions about the model and the current author 's familiarity with incorporating the model with collegiate teams ( see Voight , 1998 ) , it was hypothesized that the intervention program would have a positive effect on team unity and individual/team performance . Method <p> Participants <p> The sample consisted of two separate Division I women soccer teams who both finished in the top 3 in their respective conferences last season . Soccer team One was ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One consisted of twenty players and three coaches , and Soccer team Two had sixteen players and three coaches . The soccer teams were from two different regions in the U.S. ; Team One was from the South Region , whereby Team Two was from the Far West Region . For Team One , the mean age was 19.2 years ( SD = 1.41 ) , while Team Two had a mean age of 19.7 years ( SD = 1.63 ) . Both teams were adequately funded in terms of scholarship monies ( 9 full-ride scholarships ) . Both teams had numerous all-conference players returning ( Team One had 3 players , Team Two had 4 players ) . <p> Measures <p> The Consultant Evaluation Form ( CEF ) ( Partington &; Orlick , 1987 ) was used to record athletes ' perceptions on the effectiveness of the team building program . The CEF ( 8-items ) assessed the effectiveness of the intervention on team unity and performance , by the use of two ratings criteria ; the program 's " effect on you " and the " effect on team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hindered/interfered " ( -5 ) to " no effect " ( 0 ) , to " helped a lot " ( +5 ) . Partington and Orlick ( 1987 ) reported an alpha internal consistency coefficient of .68 , with a test-retest reliability coefficient of .81 across a 2-day interval , in addition , concurrent validity was evidenced by demonstrating positive correlation coefficients with perceived consultant effectiveness ( r = .68 , effect on you ; r = .57 , effect on team ) . For the current study , the Cronbach 's alpha coefficient for the CEF was .85 . Additionally , open-ended questions were included to request specific information regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the team building program . <p> Procedures <p> The participating coaches contacted the main researcher to conduct this team building intervention program with their respective teams . A formal needs assessment was then conducted prior to designing the specific team intervention program ( what were the teams ' primary needs and what intervention strategies were appropriate for the particular needs ) . The needs assessment consisted of discussions with the coaching staffs primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few team meetings also aided in assessing the needs of the particular teams . <p> Intervention Implementation <p> Soccer team One was taken through the intervention via a four-day workshop during their pre-season training sessions . The coaching staff conducted follow-up feedback and reinforcement of the program . The main researcher did provide feedback via weekly phone calls to the coaching staff . Soccer team Two was taken through this team building program , yet the intervention began after the team 's sixth match , and lasted through the remainder of the season . Of course , the team building intervention was specifically designed to address specific team goals and needs . At the conclusion of each teams ' seasons , the CEF was administered to determine the degree to which the team building intervention contributed to team unity and performance , the two major goals for the intervention . Table 1 lists the specific team building program per team , in terms of the timing of the intervention , need assessment plan , and specific interventions . Specific team building interventions for each team were conducted as follows : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interventions for each team were conducted through numerous stages . <p> Stage One : Evidenced by Table 1 , the needs assessed by the coach and consultant encompassed numerous areas . For Team One , major concerns included a lack of team cohesion , leadership and competitiveness in training . For Team Two , the team had an unexpected start , began doubting their talent and thus , were intimidated by ranked opponents , had little team unity and competitiveness during training . <p> Stage Two : For Team One , the plan was to utilize the team building intervention in one to two meetings a day for a four-day period , addressing individual/team goal setting , mental preparedness , and standards of performance in a collaborative effort . For Team Two , the team building intervention would be carried out during team meetings once a week , addressing team goal setting and how to improve mental readiness through the use of pre-game/pre-practice routines . <p> Stage Three : For both teams , the initial meeting began by explaining the purpose of the next few meetings , what team building is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of being open and active participants in the process . With both teams , team brainstorming was carried out to inquire about the " needs of this team " by having them as a group ( Team Two ) or in small groups ( Team One ) answer the question " what does this team have to do to be successful this season ? " The team 's input is written on a chalkboard . <p> Stage Four : Both teams then prioritized their input , from most to least important . The input reads well , and is exactly what coaches and sport psychologists want to see , but the big question is , what do all these " needs " mean , how can players improve upon these , and how can coaches and sport psychologists hold players accountable ? As a group , both teams defined what each item meant , how these points can be assessed , and how they can be held accountable for working to improve upon these items , For example , Team One listed as a prime " need " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammates are rewarded for maximal effort , if the game " goes against us " , we get the team together to refocus , and we look for signs that a teammate may need a lift ( via high five , pat on the back ) . To hold each other accountable , every week they would complete a rating form , asking each player how they did in accomplishing these behavioral indicators of leadership , citing examples . <p> Stage Five : Follow-up meetings for Team One addressed individual and team goal setting , accountability of team building standards of performance , improving mental toughness ( by knowing what we have control over versus what we do not ) , and the use of pre-game routines and routines one can utilize during the " heat " of a match . Follow-ups for Team Two addressed accountability , team goal settings , how to deal with overintensity , and the use of routines . <p> Stage Six : With both teams , follow-ups also included evaluation of team progress on their standards and goals . <p> Stage Seven : With both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conflicts , which may occur during the season . For example , Soccer team Two needed assistance in team communication issues , such as addressing teammate issues such as " how to tell teammates to work harder when you are just a freshman " . Results <p> To evaluate the effectiveness of the team building interventions , players completed the CEF at the conclusion of the season . A within-group analysis was utilized to assess player perceptions on the effectiveness of the intervention on team unity and performance since a control group was not utilized in this study . Past **26;1054;TOOLONG research has attempted to use a control group , with limited success however ( Cogan &; Petrie , 1995 ) . Descriptive statistics and participant percentages were utilized to compute the necessary data . <p> Similar to the approach utilized in previous intervention studies , to determine the effectiveness of the intervention , Fenker and Lambiotte ( 1987 ) argued that " an evaluation based on the team 's performance or attitude would conclude that the performance enhancement program was a success " ( p. 230 ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program included effectiveness ratings on team unity , individual/team performance , and open-ended responses regarding strengths and weaknesses . Table 2 summarize. , ; the responses from both teams . Overall , the data indicates that both soccer teams evaluated the approach conceptualized by Yukelson , and applied by the main researcher , extremely high . The descriptive statistics and the open-ended responses ( see Table 3 ) can thus imply that the athletes felt they benefited significantly from the team building program . <p> Individual and Team Performance <p> According to Table 2 , both teams reported that the team building program significantly helped in enhancing their individual performance : Team One had a mean of 2.8 ( range from -5 hindered to +5 helped ) , while Team Two had a mean of 3 . I. Almost half of the players from Team Two rated the program above a 4 . For team performance , both teams rated the program as significantly helping the team ( means of 3.1 and 3.9 , respectively ) , with over 80% of Team Two members rating the program above a 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of the individual and team , both teams rated the programs as being very effective at enhancing team unity . Team One had a mean of 3.1 ( range from -5 hindered to +5 helped ) , while Team Two had a mean of 3.5 . Over half of the Team Two players rated the effectiveness above 4 . <p> Open-Ended Responses <p> The written feedback from the players were consistent with their descriptive " feedback " on the effectiveness of the team building program on individual/team performance and team unity . Combining the team responses ( Table 3 ) for team unity , 31% of the players reported that it helped them come together as a team , and helped them to work together to find solutions ( 25% ) , and also enhanced team communication ( 10% ) . For performance , over 20% of the players cited that the program helped improve performance because it helped the team to focus on their daily/weekly goals . In addition , 14% of the players cited that the program helped because the meetings reminded the team about how they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by making them feel more motivated and focused . <p> The weaknesses of the program were also recorded , with 10% of Team One citing that the consultant was only with the team for a short while and wished he could have spent more time . Six percent of all players reported that they believed that meetings sometimes ran a little long and were a little repetitive , and 4% cited that it would be better to meet every two weeks instead of weekly . Conclusions <p> The major purpose of this article was to introduce coaches to a team building program while also showing two ways of implementing said program . A secondary purpose was to show the evidence from an evaluation study that investigated the effectiveness of these team building intervention programs conducted with two Division I soccer teams . The effectiveness ratings and open-ended responses from the athletes were high , indicating that the players rated the program as effective in helping their individual and team performance , as well as enhancing upon their team 's sense of unity . Major reasons cited for the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , helping the team come together and work together to problem solve , helping them to focus on goals and on their training/match play , as well as them feeling more motivated and focused on the task . <p> Often is the case in sport that success of a program is evaluated in terms of on-field performance . Both of the teams in this intervention study had very successful seasons , both representing " seasons of firsts " . Both teams won their conference for the first time , both made their first trip to tile NCAA tournament , and both made it through to the second round of the NCAA 's . For both programs , this particular season was successful when compared with the last season , even though the strength of each teams ' schedules were greater this season than last , and both teams had to deal with seniors graduating the season previous , as well as dealing with the numerous injuries that occur in a three-month season . Even though wins and losses do not adequately prove the efficacy of a team building intervention program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stock into the outcome . This is why the CEF and open-ended questions were valuable in determining the athletes ' perceptions of the effectiveness of the team building intervention . <p> Despite the team building intervention in this study being conducted by the main researcher ( a sport psychology-performance consultant ) , coaches are more than capable of being facilitators of this team building intervention program with their teams . Coaches may possibly be more effective than outside consultants because if the coaches facilitate the program , the players will be more invested into the program , thus , increasing the chance : ; that the program will have a positive impact on performance and unity . Although facilitating this program will take some advance planning , some additional time during the pre-season training period , and attention throughout the match season , the many advantages of team building ( enhanced performance and unity ) can far outweigh the extra time and attention . For example , Team One was taken through a four-day team building workshop conducted by the main researcher , yet the coaching staff maintained the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite there being a desired outcome ( NCAA tournament , seasons of " firsts " ) and positive evaluations on the CEF and open-ended responses from the athletes and coaches ( both coaches retained the main researcher 's services for the next season ) , the evaluation of the team building program 's effectiveness had limitations , however . First , the evaluation of the program 's effectiveness only occurred one time ( at the end of the season ) , as opposed to numerous times throughout the season . This continual evaluation could have provided further information regarding the impact that each specific component may have had on team unity and performance . Secondly , the intervention program implemented with these two teams may have to be modified to adequately meet the needs of other sport teams . As such , this team building intervention program is not a " one size fits all " program . Rather , it represents a general framework from which an intervention could be applied specifically to a team based upon their specific needs . <p> A final limitation concerns the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to the use of a more experimental design , such as the use of a control team ( not exposed to the intervention ) , or randomly assigning members of the same team to treatment conditions . Using control groups or treatment condition groups within the same team to evaluate intervention strategies do however present ethical and practical challenges ( Cogan &; Petrie , 1995 ) . This could be one of the contributing reasons for a lack of experimental design in field-based research . Despite these challenges , there is a continued need to determine the effectiveness of interventions through experimental methodologies . <p> Although limitations existed in the evaluation of the efficacy of this specific team building intervention program , qualitative ( athlete reports ) and quantitative ( CEF results ) evaluations tentatively supported the program 's effectiveness . It is recommended that this particular program be implemented and formally evaluated with various other sport populations . <p> Address Correspondence To : Mike Voight Department of Athletics/Physical Education , University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA 90089-0652.
