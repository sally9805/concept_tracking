He was a guy who basically did nothing but stand at a microphone and tell jokes . He was a wiseguy , a smart aleck , a comic minimalist in pursuit of the perfect gag , which , through a process of trial and error and full of genially sneering asides at the eggs he laid along the way , he often found . <P> But Bob Hope , who died last week at 100 , was something else too : the voice of 20th century America at midpassage , the spokesman of our heedless , surface-skimming spirit , the comic for the age of the production line , churning out interchangeable , immediately disposable jokes at an industrial pace . His comic persona was primitive . He was a wolf , constantly leering at pretty women , constantly rejected by them ( until the last reel ) . He was a coward , hiding his ignobility under instantly collapsible braggadocio . <P> That was about it . And the finer critical minds were always dubious about him . " Bob Hope is a good radio comedian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " critic James Agee wrote in his lament for the passing of comedy 's Golden Age . Hope lacked Groucho 's surrealism , Fields ' misanthropy , Chaplin 's soul , not to mention that element of the grotesque they all shared . Dapper and a trifle distant in his suit and tie , he also lacked their patience in building and extending gag sequences . Typical American that he was , he always wanted the instant gratification of the big boff . <P> When he was at the height of his first fame  --  with his top-rated radio program , his 12-year run in the top 10 at the movie box office  --  he set a tone for us junior-high wisecrackers that resonates to this day in our inner monologues and in our snap-dash dinner-table zappers . Give us enough gag writers ( reportedly underpaid and overworked in his case ) and a vast file of jokes ( which he stored in a fireproof vault ) , and we thought we might , on a good night , be him . <P> And , indeed , one among us managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all unlikely people , Woody Allen , ever voluble in his admiration for Hope . " It 's just shameless how I steal from him , " he said recently . " I do n't mean the contents of his jokes  --  but I do him , I lean on him . " He means Hope 's comic character  --  especially , in Allen 's early films , his sexual ineptitude and the endless spray of one-liners . What Hope uniquely had was brashness , the ability to tweak the mighty ( and their supporting ninnies ) and skip away unscathed . <P> There was no depth to Hope . But he made up for that with his tireless brio , his total lack of sentimentality  --  and his ability to stay on top of the news . He famously mastered every comic venue his 20th century offered  --  vaudeville , Broadway , radio , movies , television  --  and even in his early days he did topical jokes , designed to be tossed aside and replaced by others on tomorrow 's hot topic . This was in contrast to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the long years they toured the circuit . That skill made Hope the perfect comedian for the new media of radio and TV , which chewed up material ( and personalities ) at a manic rate . We were properly awed by his motormouth profligacy . We knew he had a million jokes on an equal number of topics : Eleanor Roosevelt , Crosby 's golf game , Los Angeles pedestrians , income taxes .
