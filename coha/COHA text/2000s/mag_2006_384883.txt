// Fig. 1 . Detail of the painting in Fig. 3. // Fig. 1 . Detail of the painting in Fig. 3. // Fitz Henry Lane1 was born in Gloucester , Massachusetts , on Cape Ann but did not settle there permanently until 1848 , " with a reputation fully established , " as the early historian of Gloucester John James Babson ( 1809-1886 ) put it.2 In the interim he had learned his trade at Pendleton 's Lithography in Boston , where he drew vignettes for sheet music covers , trade cards , and advertisements , and produced careful topographical views . Throughout the 1840s and 1850s Lane painted his hometown and its environs , and in the 1860s he painted views of Cape Ann more than any other subject . Among the latter is View of Coffin 's Beach ( Figs. 1 and 3 ) of 1862 , which has been the focus of a research project by the conservators and curators at the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston.3 Recent archival research and technical investigations of View of Coffin 's Beach have shed light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the painting . An inscription in Lane 's hand on the back of the painting ( Fig. 4 ) identifies the view , the date , and the friend to whom he gave the picture . Coffin 's Beach extends from the Essex River on the west to the Annisquam River on the east ( see Fig. 6 ) . The rocks called Two Penny Loaf , where Lane positioned himself , lie at the Essex River end of the beach . The recipient of the painting , Herman E. Davidson , was a distinguished physician in Gloucester . How he and Lane became friends has not been established , but the relationship did exist , for in the summer of 1862 Lane staved with the doctor and his wife Sarah . He had moved out of his house , which he shared with his sister , also Sarah , and her husband Ignatius Winter , with whom he had had a misunderstanding.4 // Fig. 2 .

Cape Ann Historical Association , Gloucester , Massachusetts . // Lane often chose to paint sites of historical significance in Gloucester . Coffin 's Beach , for example , was named for the landowner who established a farm there in the seventeenth century . In 1775 Peter Coffin ( c. 1724-1796 ) . an ardent patriot , and a handful of friends held off Captain John Linzee ( or Lindsay ) , a loyalist , and his crew from the Falcon when they attempted to land and make off with sheep from the farm.5 However , the farm was abandoned in Lane 's time , and it was probably the presence of John Charles Frmont ( 1813-1890 ) encamped on Coffin 's Beach in August 1862 that drew the artist to the site . A renowned explorer , Frmont had recently been relieved of his command as a general in the Union Army for exceeding his authority and had set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp , which he used as the basis for an oil painting for Frmont 's wife , Jessie ( nee Benton ; 1824-1901 ) .7 It was probably at this time that Lane also made the drawing Coffin 's Beach from the Loaf ( Fig. 2 ) , on which he based the painting in Figure 3. // Fig. 3 .

The ship appears as just a speck in the distant center right . // During the 1850s and 1860s Lane used two distinct styles of drawing : spontaneous and fluid on the one hand and static and uniform on the other.8 The drawing in Figure 2 illustrates both styles . The static and uniform style suggests that Lane used an optical device to make his topographical sketches , although there is no surviving documentation for this.9 The most likely of a variety of available devices is the compact and portable camera lucida invented by William Hyde Wollaston ( 1766-1828 ) in England and patented in 1807 . It consists of a prism attached to a flexible arm that can he clamped to a table or board ( see Fig. 8 ) . The artist looks through the prism to see the scene in front of him reflected onto the paper below the lens , ready to be traced . Since horizontal elements are easier to follow than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscapes.10 The majority of the lines in Lane 's drawing Coffin 's Beach from the Loaf have a mechanical quality that could be evidence of the tracings produced when working with a camera lucida . A comparison between Lane 's drawing and a modern one made at the same site using a nineteenth-century camera lucida ( Fig. 9 ) shows remarkable similarities : the two sketches are almost the same length and the outlines of the distant shoreline match . If either drawing had been produced freehand , it is unlikely that they would relate so closely . Lane 's drawing Coffin 's Beach from the Loaf is inscribed " Picture painted from this sketch and presented to Mrs. Dr. Davidson . " 11 Thus it is directly tied to the oil painting in Figure 3 . Lane carefully transferred the pencil composition from paper to canvas . When viewed with an infrared camera , an underdrawing is visible beneath the paint ( Fig. 5 ) . The outlines of the far shore in the underdrawing and in the sketch correspond precisely , as do those of the ledge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sketch is 17 inches wide . Moreover , the proportions between the major contours have been condensed in the underdrawing : Both the distance across the water in the middle ground and the width of the rock ledge have been shortened . // Fig. 5 . Underdrawing of Lane 's View 's of Coffin'ss Beach // Three evenly spaced vertical lines appear in both the drawing and the underdrawing and may have been used in transferring the drawing to the canvas . The method of transfer is still under investigation , but the close correlation between the sketch and the underdrawing again suggests that Lane used mechanical means . While there were many methods available for transferring and enlarging drawings at the time . Lane most probably used the camera lucida for this as well . // Fig. 6 . Map showing the location that Lane painted and the surrounding area . // In addition to explaining how to use the instrument to draw , the instructions included with the camera lucida in Figure 8 discuss how to make precise enlargements.12 To double the size of a sketch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas and the prism is double the distance between the sketch and the prism . Given the working distances required for enlargement , a canvas the width of Lane 's View of Coffin 's Beach could not be seen in its entirety through the prism of the camera lucida . The artist would have needed to transfer the sketch in sections . Most probably he had to shift the camera lucida twice during the transfer , and the three vertical lines showed him precisely where to pick up after each shift . Although the relationship between the underdrawing and the finished painting is close , Lane made subtle but significant changes . He smoothed over details such as the tops of the trees in the background , and he nearly tripled the expanse of the sky , accentuating the horizontal format and emphasizing the expansiveness of the composition and the sense of emptiness in the finished oil . The camera lucida captures only stationary elements . Neither the original sketch nor the transferred underdrawing include any of the transitory elements in the final work : the sailboat , waves , clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted these directly after laying in the ocean and sky . For the dawn light , he applied thin layers of paint and blended them on the canvas to create the imperceptible transitions from salmon pink to blue in the glowing color of the early morning sky . Along with the careful refinement of the composition , it is Lane 's exploration of light and color that transforms his topographical study into a work of art . Photograph Fig. 7 .
