ONE Hartsville , North Carolina June 2004 The Confederate stood on the seventy-first of the one hundred and five concrete steps that led from Hartsville 's Main Street to the Pisgah County Courthouse . Rifle at his side , he 'd kept a weatherbeaten watch for any encroaching Yankees for as long as Mary Crow could remember . Passing him on her fourth-grade civics field trip , she 'd cowered at his towering bronze fierceness . Six years later , as she 'd rushed past to apply for her driver 's license , she 'd found him an embarrassing symbol of the unreconstructed South . Today , nearly twenty-five years after their first acquaintance , the old boy seemed as comforting as a childhood friend . Not much else about Pisgah County did . " Hey , Johnny Reb . " She paused for a moment to look up at the carefully wrought figure of a young private in the Confederate Army . Having been erected in front of the courthouse , he truly faced east , but cut his eyes northward , ever vigilant for an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one long strand of spiderweb dangled from his rear , he still looked ready to face whatever challenge the blue bellies might throw at him . Mary wondered if she was in such good shape . Already she was breathing heavily from her climb , and she still had thirty-four steps to go . She 'd forgotten how hot the early June sun could be in the Carolina mountains , and she 'd foolishly worn Deathwrap , her prosecutorial black suit . Comfortable in the relentlessly air-conditioned courtrooms of Atlanta , here sleek Deathwrap felt like a portable sauna , too close , too heavy , too tight against her skin . " Damn , " she grumbled , leaning against the base of thestatue . Already she 'd torn her hose and sweated through her underwear . Pretty soon she 'd have big damp circles under her arms . In her business it was never good to be visibly nervous ; to be both nervous and sweating like a pig did not bode well at all . Nonetheless , she had an appointment with DA George Turpin in four minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , she resumed her ascent to the courthouse . As her high heels clicked on the steps , she gave a rueful smile at the irony of her undertaking . When she was eighteen , she 'd ached to leave Pisgah County forever . Today , at thirty-five , she could n't wait to come back home . The past twelve months had been her year of living dangerously . She 'd left her ADA job in Atlanta to go to Peru with archaeologist Gabe Benge . Though it seemed like a wonderful chance for a whole new life , eight months into it she knew she 'd made a mistake . One day she was taking a boat ride on Lake Titicaca . As she looked over into the water , a huge fish surfaced next to the boat . For a moment it swam along beside them , its scales flashing in the sun , then it returned to the depths of the lake , the beautiful silver body fading into the translucent green water . Instinctively , she turned to tell Jonathan , then she caught herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , another hemisphere . Jonathan would never share that singular moment with the silvery fish and the blue sky and green Lake Titicaca . The realization struck her with such a yearning for home that it was all she could do to stay in the boat and not start swimming for shore . Why are you here , the lake seemed to whisper , among mountains you ca n't name , Indians who will never regard you as anything more than a tourist ? It was then that she knew she had to go home . Not home to Gabe or even home to Atlanta , but back to her true home in the North Carolina mountains , her true home with Jonathan Walkingstick . Somehow everything she did n't need at eighteen , she needed quite desperately now . But coming home to Pisgah County required money , and for that , she needed a job . She 'd called George Turpin two weeks ago , as soon as she stepped off the plane in Atlanta . He 'd sounded enthusiastic over the phoneYes , I 'd love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your experience on my staff . In fact , we have a man who 's taking early retirement . When could you come up for a talk ? They 'd made their arrangements , and settled upon today , here , in about three minutes . If she hurried , she would be on time . She finally reached the hundred and fifth step , and strode into the vaulted lobby of the old courthouse . She passed a gaggle of secretaries clad in frothy print dresses , hurrying to begin their day 's work . Suddenly she felt even more out of place . Swathed in black among women clad in the colors of melting sherbet , she realized she must look like the grim reaper seeking her next victim . When she glanced over her shoulder and caught one of the secretaries casting a curious eye back at her , she knew without a doubt that she would be the courthouse 's gossip tidbit du jour . Did y'all see that girl dressed in that fancy black suit ? Who was she ? You do n't see clothes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over from Raleigh . Do n't kid yourself , honey . Did n't you see that hair ? She was pure Cherokee . . . . Shrugging off the imaginary wags , Mary checked the building directory beside the elevator . Turpin 's office was on the third floor . She rode with two men in seersucker suits , one of whom looked like someone she might have gone to high school with . She considered introducing herself , but both hurried out when they reached the second floor . She rode on , alone , to the next floor , where at the end of the hall stood a frosted glass door with " George H. Turpin , District Attorney " lettered in gold . She entered to find an older woman seated behind a desk . Gray hair curled on her head like steel wool , and unlike the younger women downstairs , she wore a more decorous linen suit with a simple white blouse . When the woman looked up at Mary , her mouth drew down in a thin line . " May I help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nine o'clock , " Mary answered . " My name is Mary Crow . " Her words seemed to frost the woman further . Mary knew her name was not altogether unknown here . She had , three years ago , broken up a conspiracy that had put Pisgah County Sheriff Stump Logan on the FBI 's most wanted list . Then , a year later , she had killed that same sheriff near Devil 's Fork Gap in Madison County . Though Logan had been found to be a kidnapper , rapist , and murderer , he had also headed a powerful political machine and was still fondly remembered by a number of people on the county payroll . Mary knew that she would have to tread carefully in this courthouse . Turpin 's secretary began writing in some kind of logbook . " Mary C-r-o-w-e , " she spelled aloud , using the traditional Cherokee spelling of the name . " Just C-r-o-w , " Mary corrected . " Really ? Most people around here spell it the other way . " The woman looked at her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd dropped the e on the end of her name back when she 'd gone to college and simultaneously dropped most all of her Cherokee past . She was n't sure there was any point in adding it now . " Have a seat , " the secretary said , not bothering to correct her misspelling . " Mr. Turpin 'll see you in a moment . " Mary crossed the room and sat by a window that afforded her a view of Johnny Reb 's backside , with Hartsville stretched out beyond him . A town of storefronts and sidewalks , Hartsville stood wedged in between a line of the Southern Railroad and the looming Plott Balsam Mountains . It had changed a lot in her seventeen-year absence . Though the west end of Main Street was still somberly comprised of law offices , banks , a motel , and Morehouse 's funeral home , trendier , more lighthearted businesses had opened up on east Main . On her way to the courthouse Mary had passed a travel agency , a yoga studio , a massage and nail salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southern Living magazine . Who would have thought that ? Mary wondered , remembering when Hartsville 's most exotic restaurant was the Fish Camp Grill , a shack on the river that would fry , for a small fee , whatever you managed to catch off their back deck , hush puppies and coleslaw compliments of the house . " Ms. Crow ? " A deep voice interrupted her drift into the past . She turned to face a heavyset , balding man dressed in the summer uniform of all Southern attorneyskhaki trousers , navy blazer , striped regimental tie . " George Turpin . " He extended his hand , his smile revealing a chipped front tooth that gave him a boyish look that belied his middle age . " I 've heard so much about you . It 's a real pleasure to meet you . " She rose and shook his hand . " Come on back to my office , " he said . " Would you like some coffee ? A Coke ? " " No , thank you , " she replied , glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glasses . Turpin led her to a corner office that boasted a now-empty fireplace . Where her former boss in Atlanta had decked his walls with basketball memorabilia , George Turpin splattered his personal space with photographs of himself with the prominent and powerful . Turpin golfing with the governor of North Carolina , Turpin hewing down a tree with the local congressman , Turpin shaking hands with the chairman of the new Cherokee gaming commission . Interspersed among the photos were a dozen shadow-box frames displaying the kind of rosette ribbons awarded at county fairs and horse shows . Blues , mostly , with a few reds and yellows thrown in for a touch of humility . " Do you show horses ? " Mary stepped over to get a closer look at one ribbon . " Honey , any horse I got on would keel over from my excess avoirdupois . " Turpin patted his rotund middle . " No , all those ribbons are for barbecue . " " Barbecue ? " Mary frowned . Since when had they made barbecue a contact sport ? " Pisgah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championship for the past five years , " Turpin explained proudly . " We compete in the vinegar-and-pepper category and the tomato-based group . Best durn stuff you 'll ever put in your mouth . Here . " Turpin sat down behind his desk and pulled a bottle of dark orange liquid from a drawer . " Take this home with you . Put it on anythingpork , chicken , ribs . Tofu , if you 're a tree-hugger . You 'll think you 've died and gone to heaven . " " Thanks . " Mary took the jar the man offered and sat down across from him . " It looks wonderful . " " It is . I tell you , when I retire , I 'm gon na open me up a little barbecue shack on 441 . Catch all them tourists goin ' into the casino before they lose all their money . " Turpin laughed heartily , amused by his own future , then he returned to the present , pulling her resume from his drawer . " Let me say right off it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regarded your mentor , Judge Irene Hannah , as a great legal mind and a true friend . " He tapped Mary 's resume . " Your record does her proud . " " Thank you . " Mary smiled at the memory of the woman in whose footsteps she 'd followed , in whose house she now lived . " Irene was a wonderful person . " " She was indeed . Even though that Logan business caught us all with our pants down , we owe you a debt of gratitude for bringing him to justice . " Mary did n't know what to say . She had n't intended to embarrass Pisgah County law , she 'd simply killed a corrupt county sheriff who was trying to kill her . " Who 's sheriff here now ? " she asked , curious about who might have dared take Logan 's place . " A young man named Jerry Cochran , " said Turpin . " Went to high school hereyou may know him . " " Actually , I do . We were lab partners in biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bookish boy who nearly fainted when they dissected their frog , she could n't imagine him donning a badge and sidearm to fight crime in Pisgah County . " I would n't have given him a chance in hell to get elected , but the voters seemed to like him . Real high-tech , low-key kind of guy . " Turpin shrugged , then turned his attention to her file . " Let 's talk a little bit about this , now . Tell me why somebody with this record would want to work here ? " His chair squeaked as he leaned back , waiting for her reply . Mary 's tongue felt stuck to the roof of her mouth . What should she say ? That in the middle of Lake Titicaca she 'd gotten so homesick , she almost cried ? That as sweet as the jasmine-scented nights of Miraflores had been , she longed for the smell of pine , the touch of Jonathan Walkingstick instead of Gabe Benge ? Why not , she decided . It made as much sense as any other reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . " To do that , I need a job . Criminal prosecution is what I do . " Turpin smiled . " You 're Cherokee , are n't you ? " " Half , " said Mary . " My mother grew up in Snowbird . My father was from Atlanta . " " And you 've lived away from here for how long ? " " Seventeen years . I went to live with my grandmother shortly after my mother died . " Mary shifted in her chair . She never told new acquaintances that her mother had been murdered ; she could n't bear the cheap sympathy that such a remark evoked . " Well , I do n't know how well you 've kept up with things here , but this is about as far from Hot-lanta as you can get . We have one , maybe two murders a year , and most of those are somebody getting drunk and shooting whatever significant other gets on the wrong end of their deer rifles . " Turpin sighed . " A trained monkey could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's okay , " said Mary . " There 's more to law than just convicting murderers . " Turpin frowned . " That 's true , but I bet if I put you on staff you 'd be looking for a new job in six months . I do n't mean to be discouraging , honey , but Pisgah County is for lawyers who want nice , quiet careers that allow them time to enter barbecue cook-offs or coach Little League . " Again he tapped her resume . " These pages tell me that you eat , breathe , and sleep felony prosecutions . Having you at Pisgah County would be like hitching Seabiscuit up to a plow . " Mary was puzzled . Turpin seemed uncomfortable with the fact that she was good at what she did . " But I gave you my credentials when we talked on the phone . I thought you were excited about the possibility of my joining your staff . " Turpin sighed . " To be honest , Ms. Crow , I 'd love to put you in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't have an opening anymore . " Mary sat there , stunned . Two weeks ago , Turpin had practically offered her a job over the phone . He explained further . " When you first called I had Pete Nicholson 's resignation on my desk . Three days later , Pete came in and asked if he could stay on . His wife had been diagnosed with breast cancer , and they 've still got a boy in college . " " I see . " Mary wondered if Turpin 's colleague was indeed hanging on to his paycheck , or if Turpin was turning her down for some other reason . Again , she did n't know what to say . She had depended upon getting this job . Irene 's little house needed a new well and a new roof and God knows what else . For the last three days , she 'd had to haul water in with her car and take sponge baths in the sink . She tried another tack . " I do n't suppose you could give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ? " Turpin closed the folder that held her resume . " I 'm sorry . I just do n't have the budget for that . " " I see , " Mary said quietly . " Tell you what , though . Leave me a number where I can reach you . If and when I get a vacancy , I 'll call you right away . I owe Irene Hannah that much . " Mary reached in her purse and handed him one of the business cards she 'd made up last night , on her computer . Turpin 's brows lifted as he read it . " This is a local number , " he said . " I thought you lived in Atlanta . " " Not anymore . Irene Hannah left me her farm . I 'm a full-time resident of Pisgah County , as of a week ago , " she replied , hoping that might make a difference . A look of discomfit flitted across Turpin 's face , then vanished as he clipped Mary 's card to her folder . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be sure to give you a buzz . " Mary gathered her bottle of barbecue sauce and the black leather briefcase she 'd brought with her . I ca n't believe this , she thought , trying to fight the blush of humiliation spreading across her cheeks . She , with her perfect record , turned down by a man who could probably count all his murder convictions on one barbecue-stained hand . " Thanks for seeing me , Mr. Turpin . " She smiled through clenched teeth . " It 's been a pleasure . " " Thank you for coming , dear . " Turpin took her hand in his . " I promise I 'll be in touch . It may be a while , but I wo n't forget you . " Enduring the openly snide smile of Turpin 's secretary , Mary hurried out of the office and into the waiting elevator . Moments later , she was trudging back down the hundred and five steps , dodging two starry-eyed teenagers who were holding hands and giggling . After they passed , she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , Johnny Reb , " she whispered , incredulous at Turpin 's complete about-face . " They do n't want me here . " Swallowing hard , she fought a moment of panic . Two weeks ago she 'd left a man who loved her and a potentially promising career in Atlanta for a rural mountain county where the chief legal officer seemed prouder of his barbecue sauce than his conviction rate . Had she totally lost her mind ? Was she going through some premature midlife crisis ? She looked up at the statue 's face . The sun now cast the eyes in deep shadow , making the mouth a protuberant bulge . Where earlier the young soldier had looked vigilant , now he seemed to gaze at the mountains wistfully , as if longing to be reunited with the companions who 'd marched off and left him here to stand watch , so long ago . Mary felt a sudden kinship with the young man . Though both were of Pisgah County , both were now also strangers to it . It occurred to her that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier 's dreams . " Maybe someday you 'll find what you 're looking for , Johnny Reb , " Mary murmured , turning her gaze from the statue to the little mountain town below . " And maybe someday I will , too .
