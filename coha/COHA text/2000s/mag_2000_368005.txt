Years ago , Tim Luckey 's great-grandfather started a farm in Tennessee . When Luckey 's grandfather and then his father inherited the farm , both paid inheritance tax . Someday Tim hopes to inherit the farm , and when he does , he will probably pay the tax again , as will his children , years down the road  --  all for the same 650 acres . <P> Brad Eiffert owns a lumberyard in Columbia , Mo . He pays $36,000 a year for a life-insurance policy just so his children can inherit the yard unencumbered and not have to borrow from savings  --  or even sell the business  --  just to pay the estate tax . <P> Stories like these and other inequities are at the root of the newfound momentum in Washington to junk the estate tax , which currently reaches rates as high as 55% . The House passed a repeal bill in June , and with few changes , the Senate signed off on it last month . President Clinton has vowed to veto the bill , which he calls a tax break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough support for an override . Still , the issue promises to have legs . <P> Both George W. Bush and Al Gore have staked out the " death tax " as a campaign issue . Bush wants to repeal it outright . Gore has reacted by proposing to double the exemption , to $5 million per family for a business left in an estate . Both positions reflect a sudden urge on the part of government to help family-owned businesses . Maybe it 's because the unleashing of the Internet has put a spotlight on entrepreneurial pursuit and its value in an economy in which small businesses continue to provide the most jobs . Maybe it 's because in flush times we can afford to do what 's right . <P> The plain truth is , this tax is an embarrassment . It amounts to multiple taxation on enterprise and hard-earned savings . We get taxed when we earn . We get taxed when we spend . We should not get taxed when we save . The estate tax was instituted in part to help fund World War I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peace is at hand , and we have a budget surplus . <P> But resistance to repeal has deep populist roots that are hard to dig out . And there is no point denying it : repealing the estate tax would benefit the superrich . Short of communism , any plan to get rid of a tax that many see as immoral is bound to help billionaires . So what ? The barrels of ink spilled on this point miss the mark . <P> The Clinton-Gore position is an attempt to dodge the populist backlash and still do something for small-business owners and farmers . The increased exemption is a start , but it has a serious flaw : the exemption can be difficult to get . For example , heirs must be active in a business for a set amount of time . What if they 'd rather go to college ? Or are disabled ? <P> In survey after survey , owners cite the estate tax as a top concern . They are worried that heirs will have to sell the business to pay the tax . Critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates are subject to the tax , thanks to exemptions already in place , and that only 3% of the estates taxed are family farms or businesses .
