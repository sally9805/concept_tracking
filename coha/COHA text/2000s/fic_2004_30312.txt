PROLOGUE Saturday , September 25 Near the Tuli River Valley , Zimbabwe The last rays of the sun were gone , and thousands of stars shimmered weakly against a dark sky high above a rugged , arid land . This region of Zimbabwe was dirt poor , even by that troubled nation 's rock bottom standards . There were almost no electric lights to illuminate the night , and there were few paved roads connecting southern Matabeleland 's isolated villages to the larger world beyond . Twin headlights suddenly appeared in the darkness , briefly illuminating thickets of gnarled scrub trees and scattered patches of thorn bushes and sparse grass . A battered Toyota pickup truck swayed along a worn dirt track , gears grinding as it bounced in and out of a series of deep ruts . Drawn by the flickering beams of light , swarms of insects flitted toward the pickup and spattered against its dust streaked windshield . " Merde ! " Gilles Ferrand swore softly , wrestling with the steering wheel . Frowning , the tall , bearded Frenchman leaned forward , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His thick glasses slipped down his nose . He took one hand off the wheel to push them back up and then swore again as the pickup nearly veered off the winding track . " We should have left Bulawayo sooner , " he grumbled to the slender gray haired woman beside him . " This so called road is bad enough in daylight . It is a nightmare now . I wish the plane had not been so late . " Susan Kendall shrugged . " If wishes were fishes , Gilles , we 'd all be dead of mercury poisoning , Our project requires the new seeds and tools we were sent , and when you serve the Mother , you mustaccept inconveniences . " Ferrand grimaced , wishing for the thousandth time that his prim American colleague would stop lecturing him . Both of them were veteran activists in the worldwide Lazarus Movement , working to save the Earth from the insane greed of unchecked global capitalism . There was no need for her to treat him like a schoolboy . The truck 's high beams silhouetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman sighed in relief . They were close to their destination a tiny settlement adopted three months ago by the Lazarus Movement , He did n't remember the village 's original name . The first thing he and Kendall had done was rename it Kusasa , " Tomorrow " in the local Ndebele dialect . It was an apt name , or so they hoped . The people of Kusasa had agreed to the change and to accept the Movement 's help in returning to a natural and eco friendly method of farming . Both activists believed their work here would lead a rebirth of wholly organic African agriculture a rebirth rooted in absolute opposition to the West 's toxic pesticides , chemical fertilizers , and dangerous genetically modified crops . The American woman was certain that her impassioned speeches had won over the village elders . Ferrand , more cynical by nature , suspected that the generous cash grants the Movement offered had carried more weight . No matter , he thought , the ends in this case would amply justify the means . He turned off the main track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huts , tin roofed shacks , and ramshackle cattle pens . Surrounded by small fields , Kusasa lay in a shallow valley edged by boulder-strewn hills and tall brush . He brought the truck to a stop and lightly tapped the horn . No one came out to meet them . Ferrand killed the engine but left the headlights on . He sat still for a moment , listening . The village dogs were howling . He felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise . Susan Kendall frowned . " Where is everyone ? " " I do not know . " Ferrand slid cautiously out from behind the wheel . By now dozens of excited men , women , and children should have been thronging around them grinning and murmuring in glee at the sight of the bulging seed bags and brand new shovels , rakes , and hoes piled high in the Toyota 's cargo bed . But nothing stirred among Kusasa 's darkened buts . " Hello ? " the Frenchman called . He tried out his limited Ndebele . " Litshone Njani ? Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the night sky . Ferrand shivered . He leaned back inside the pickup . " Something is very wrong here , Susan . You should make contact with our people . Now . As a precaution . " The gray haired American woman stared at him for a moment , her eyes suddenly wide . Then she nodded and climbed down out of the Toyota . Working swiftly , she set up the linked satellite phone/laptop computer they carried in the field . It allowed them to communicate with their home office in Paris , though it was mainly used to upload photos and progress reports to the main Lazarus Web site . Ferrand watched her in silence . Most of the time he found Susan Kendall intensely annoying , but she had courage when it counted . Perhaps more courage than he himself possessed . He sighed and reached under the seat for the flashlight clipped there . After a moment 's reflection , he stung their digital camera over his shoulder . " Mat are you doing , Gilles ? " she asked , already punching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look around , " he said stiffly . " All right . But you should wait until I have a connection , " Kendall told him . She held the satellite phone to her ear for a moment . Her thin lipped mouth tightened . " They 've already left the office . There 's no answer . " Ferrand checked his watch . France was only an hour behind them , but it was the weekend . They were on their own . " Try the Web site , " he suggested . She nodded . Ferrand forced himself to move . He squared his shoulders and walked slowly into the village . He swept his flashlight in a wide arc , probing the darkness ahead . A lizard scuffled away from the beam , startling him . He muttered a soft curse and kept going . Sweating now despite the cool night breeze , he came to the open space at the center of Kusasa . There was the village well . It was a favorite gathering place for young and old alike at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ... and froze . The people of Kusasa would not rejoice over the seeds and farm equipment he had brought them . They would not lead the rebirth of African agriculture . They were dead . All of them were dead . The Frenchman stood frozen , his mind reeling in horror . There were corpses everywhere he looked . Dead men , women , and children lay in heaps across the clearing . Most of the bodies were intact , though twisted and misshapen by some terrible agony . Others seemed eerily hollow , almost as though they had been partially eaten from the inside out . A few were reduced to nothing more than torn shreds of flesh and bone surrounded by congealed puddles of bloodred slime . Thousands of huge black flies swarmed over the mutilated corpses , lazily feasting on the remains . Near the well , a small dog nuzzled the contorted body of a young child , vainly trying to rouse its playmate . Gilles Ferrand swallowed hard , fighting down a surge of bile and vomit . With trembling hands , he set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , and began taking pictures . Someone had to document this terrible slaughter . Someone had to warn the world of this massacre of the innocents of people whose only crime had been to side with the Lazarus Movement . *** Four men lay motionless on one of the hills overlooking the village . They wore desert camouflage fatigues and body armor . Night vision goggles and binoculars gave them a clear view of every movement made below while audio pickups fed every sound into their headsets . One of the observers studied a shielded monitor . He looked up . " They have a link to the satellite . And we 're tapped in with them . " His leader , a giant auburn haired man with bright green eyes , smiled thinly . " Good . " He leaned closer to get a better view of the screen . It showed a series of gruesome images the pictures taken only minutes before by Gilles Ferrand slowly loading onto the Lazarus Web site . The green eyed man watched carefully . Then he nodded . " That 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly entering commands on a portable keypad . He tapped the enter key , sending a set of coded instructions to the communications satellite high overhead . One second later , the digital pictures streaming up from Kusasa froze , flickered , and then vanished . The green eyed man glanced at the two men lying flat next to him . Both were armed with Heckler &; Koch PSG I sniper rifles designed for covert operations use . " Now kill them . " He focused his night vision binoculars on the two Lazarus Movement activists . The bearded Frenchman and the slender American woman were staring down at their satellite hookup in disbelief . " Target acquired , " one of the snipers murmured . He squeezed the trigger . The 7.62mm round hit Ferrand in the forehead . The Frenchman toppled backward and slid to the ground , smearing blood and brains down the side of the Toyota . " Target down . " The second sniper fired an instant later . His bullet caught Susan Kendall high in the back . She fell in a heap next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . More of his men , these wearing hazardous materials suits , were already moving down the slope carrying an array of scientific equipment . He keyed his throat mike , reporting through an encrypted satellite link , " This is Prime . Field One is complete . Evaluation , collection , and analysis proceeding as planned . " He eyed the two dead Lazarus activists . " SPARK has also been initiated ... as ordered . "
