" There is a question , " our correspondent writes , " that less-sophisticated , Americans ask ( and more-sophisticated , Americans would like to ) : Why are people in the Middle East so crazy ?

It is important to understand Arab culture . Egypt seems a good place to start . Egypt is by far the most populous Arab state . And although Egypt is a poor country in per-capita-income terms , its economy is larger than Saudi Arabia 's . Historically Egypt has been the most westward-looking of Arab countries .

In the November 11 , 2001 , New York Times , John Kifner wrote , " It is on just this Arab ... street that President Bush must fight in his war against Osama bin Laden . " On January 24 , 2002 , Chris Matthews said on the television program Hardball , " America 's been fighting another kind of war to win the hearts and minds of the Arab street " And on November 16 , 2001 , the NBC Nightly News reporter Martin Fletcher , broadcasting from Cairo , declared , " The battleground is n't only in Afghanistan ; it 's here in the Arab street .

In his well-ironed dress-down Friday clothing , clean grooming , and chilly politeness , he was the exact counterpart of a Mossad agent at Ben-Gurion Airport . " I would like to ask you a few questions about why you are visiting Egypt , " the solemn fellow said . My tour operator , carrying a placard with my name completely misspelled , swooped in with a great bustle : " We are a prominent Egyptian tourism company ! Government-licensed ! This man is a valued client ! Tourism is in a ruinous state ! Do you even see another tourist ? ! What will become of Egypt 's foreign-reserve situation ? ! " - although that was all body language . I believe the only thing my tour operator actually said to the intelligence officer was " He 's with me . " Away we went Have your travel agent try that with the Mossad .

The alternative is ... the favor of the mighty . " The mighty have their seat in the capital . Better stick close to their chair legs and napkins to get a crumb from the mighty 's table . Cairo is the largest city in the Middle East and Africa , with as many as 16 million people , most of whom were offering to carry my luggage at the airport . And they were more persistent than the secret police . Annex Damascus to Beirut , Baghdad , Kuwait City , Jerusalem , and Riyadh ( what a war you 'd have ! ) and you still would n't get Cairo .

Think of a capital of the United States located in an obscure Maryland swamp with 70 million Americans gathered there to be close to Medicare benefits , Fannie Mae , and Small Business Administration loan originations . After ninety minutes in my tour van I realized : so vast is Cairo , there really is no way across it . At least no way with my eyes open . The traffic is too scary . We Americans , who invented traffic , are always being startled by the forms into which it has evolved around the world . ( God , if he 's a Darwinian , may be similarly aghast at life . ) But most foreign driving has the advantage of either brevity , in its breakneck pace , or safe if sorry periods of complete rest , in jam-ups . Cairenes achieve the prolonged bravado of NASCAR drivers while also turning any direction they want , in congestion worse than L.A 's during an O.J. freeway chase . // When I could bear to peek , I saw traffic cops-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at intersections and acting with the efficiency and decisiveness usual to committees . And I saw a driving school . What could the instruction be like ? " No , no , Anwar , faster through the stop sign , and make your left from the far-right lane " Surely John Kifner , Chris Matthews , and NBC News are kidding when they use " Arab street " as a metaphor for anything in the Middle East . Or , considering the history of the Middle East , maybe they aren't. the bar at the Mena House Hotel , in Giza , has half a dozen floor-to-ceiling windows , and the view of the Great Pyramid of Khufu fills them all . A number of people were in the bar . Unfortunately for business , they all worked there . Several waiters craned their necks , trying to catch my eye . Across the room full of empty tables a musical trio abandoned their classical repertoire and began cracking one another up with jazz noodlings of " Woman in Love .

I wandered across the street to the pyramid complex , now closed for the evening . Behind a police station was a stable yard with horses and camels kept for foreign visitors who , in better times , when there are foreign visitors , want a Lawrence of Suburbia moment on their home videos . There I met Mousa , who presented himself , in so many words , as the Night Mayor of Khufu . He promised a forbidden after-hours tour . " Can we climb to the top ? " I asked . " It is forbidden " We walked through an alley , past a large hole in the wall that surrounds the pyramid complex . " Japanese tourists did this , " Mousa said , " to climb to the top . " Has anyone had any success understanding Japanese culture ?

" I must tell my father there is one tourist in Egypt , " Mousa said . I asked him about the September 11 terrorist attacks . " Whoever does this ruins my life , " Mousa said . " I do not know who does this . " Perhaps taking my silence as a rebuke , Mousa continued , " Maybe Osama bin Laden does this " He warmed to his theme . " Osama bin Laden does the killing in Luxor . " Mousa was referring to the murder of fifty-eight tourists at the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut , in November of 1997 . And Mousa may have had a point . According to the Egyptian police , one of the killers , Midhat Mohammed Abdel-Rahman , had traveled to Afghanistan and Sudan for terrorist training . " Osama lives in Egypt before , " Mousa said . ( Maybe not , but the family business , Binladen Brothers for Contracting and Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for Egypt . He tries to destroy our country . " We walked across the outskirts of the village of Nazlet as-Samaan . The people who helped with the building of the pyramids once lived here . Now the people who help with the gawking do . We went behind the Sphinx into the quarry where pyramid makings were cut , 4,600 years ago , and climbed to the edge of the Giza Plateau . There was Khufuimmense , 449 feet high , almost exactly 745 feet wide at the base of each side . The stones are n't as big as those that the Hebrews in The Ten Commandments hauled across the movie screen . The real blocks of granite and limestone are about the size of industrial air-conditioning units on strip-mall roofs . They look depressingly unfake . You can imagine the awful labor of heaving and pulling these rocks-2.3 million of them , according to Mousa .

The city is A certain amount of craziness , if not possessed already , can be accuired trying to walk in Cairo . The city is well supplied with sidewalks , but they just take you around the block . You ca n't step off them , because of the traffic . The locals manage to cross streets . I began thinking that Cairenes employ some chapter of the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead , which I missed when I was a hippie , that tells them how to keep going after they 've been squashed between two trucks . It took me forty-five minutes to cross the Shari El Corniche to get to the Nile embankment-and then , rather than try it again , I hiked almost a mile to what I thought was a walkway overpass . It was n't an overpass . It was a stairway for pedestrian access to one of Cairo 's few stretches of expressway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo jaywalking : a sort of double-black-diamond run for the Cairo shoe slalom . Later , in a taxi on this same expressway , my driver missed an exit and backed up to it from somewhere beyond the next one . Cairo 's buildings are Cairo 's traffic in concrete . Every structure seems halfway through construction or halfway through demolition , and some seem to be undergoing both . This is modern Cairo . You can find old stones in the town if you let your tour guide drag you to them . My tour guide , Peter , did his best to show me a first-century Roman fort , the ninth-century mosque of Ibn Tulun , and Saladin 's twelfth-century citadel . But even the pyramids are as beside the point in Cairo as the Dutch wall is on Wall Street . Functionally all of Cairo is modern . The population was only 570,100 in 1897 . The number of residents has more than tripled in the past twenty-five years . I saw a cement truck , barrel turning , load ready to pour , driving down a Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtearings in central Cairo 's business district look the way they do in every busy place . Or they would if you could see them behind the profusion of blimp-sized billboards that look the way they do in every busy place . As it turns out , the Nile is just a river in Egypt  --  not nearly as wide as the Hudson River at the George Washington Bridge . Cairo 's rich have river views and live , as most rich do nowadays , in apartment houses of faceless effrontery . The only apparent difference from the apartments of the American rich with river views is that in the Cairo apartments every single room has a huge chandelier . But the emblematic building of Cairo is the small tower block-five or six stories designed in a functionalism so basic that the Bauhaus architects were lapdogs of ornamentalism by comparison . Slab floors are supported by reinforced  --  concrete posts and beams , like the skeletons of timber  --  frame Colonial farmhouses-and like Colonial farmhouses , the tower blocks tend sometimes to the rhomboid . The spaces between the posts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently at random , with little windows and balconies . The outside edges of poured-concrete staircases poke through the masonry , their runs and risers making zigzag patterns . Dried oozes of mortar cling to the brickwork . Water pipes and electrical wires are tacked onto the outside walls as if in half-hearted , rust-staining homage to the Pompidou Center . In Europe these myriad domiciles would look like self  --  storage units for the urban proletariat . In Egypt concrete mosques are crammed between the tenements and festooned with colored lights-as if for Christmas decoration , except no red , just the green of Islam . Commerce hums on the ground floors in shops and restaurants , one called Pizza Hat . Roofs are adorned with the festive dishware of satellite TV . The walls of the little balconies are plastered and painted blindingly cheerful shades of swimming-pool blue and lawn-chemical green . " Plain exteriors , " Peter said , " mean less taxes to the government . Interiors are very often elaborate . " And peering into bright living rooms , I could see another emblematic Cairo item-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontainebleaus ' ( the one in France and the one in Miami ) worth of carving and gilt and is upholstered in plush , petit point , plaid , and paisley , as if Donald Trump and Madame de Pompadour and Queen Victoria and The Doors had gotten together to start a decorating firm . Often there 's a pair of matching chairs . You see the astonishingly ugly sofa everywhere-in the homes of the well-off and the otherwise , in hotel lobbies , office reception areas , furniture-store windows ( of course ) , and , most spectacularly , on Egyptian television sitcom sets . One actor sits down on the couch and makes an exasperated face while the other actors gesticulate comically . I could n't understand what was going on in Egyptian sitcoms , but I could tell it was more charming than Montel Williams . I got to watch a lot of Egyptian TV , owing to a miscalculation in my attempt at cultural understanding . I 'd arrived in Egypt in early December , in the middle of Ramadan . Not that Ramadan itself is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended Yom Kippur , with fasting from sunrise to sunset . Nothing is supposed to pass the lips , not even a smoke or a sip of water . And Egyptians , at least in public , observe the rules . Clubs and discos are closed . Coffeehouses are empty . People in airport lounges are reading the Koran aloud . I was changing money when a call to midday prayer came from the PA system of the local mosque . The bank guard put his rifle aside , unrolled a rug , and performed his devotions . Fortunately , bank robbers were as pious and made no depredations . But Ramadan also has the aspect of a month-long Thanksgiving dinner with the family . When the sun goes down , everyone rushes home for the far feast . Another big meal , suhour , is served before dawn . There 's a bit of Christmas , too , with shopping for toys and clothes to be given to children during the three days of the eid al-fitr , when the fasting is over . Stores are open at all hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets at three and four in the morning , children in tow . I 'd been in Egypt for a week before I realized I was a diurnal creature in a nocturnal biosystem . During the hours of daylight Egyptians are-considering that they 're hungry , thirsty , and really wanting a cigarette  --  remarkably cheerful . That is , when they 're awake . People sleep late . Arriving in Egypt during Ramadan is like arriving in an American small town on a holiday weekend about the time that the bowl games come on . Ramadan is , in fact , Egypt 's peak television-viewing period . " Best TV Land is in Ramadan : " I heard an announcer say as I surfed past what might have been an Arabic version of Late Night With Conan O'Brien . The celebrity guests were sitting on an astonishingly ugly sofa . The effusive , jolly ugliness of furniture suits a city that should be depressing but is n't . And the city ought to be squalid . It 's an impoverished metropolis with a population density three times New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky that ranges in color from cheap-motel bed sheet to frightening diaper . There 's little begging , although plenty of Whereyoufrom Youbuypostcardokay ? if you look like a tourist , and I do . Nobody is living on the street . The homeless , Peter explained , have teamed up with the lifeless . The city 's huge Eastern and Southern Cemeteries are filled with house-sized mausoleums used as houses . The Egyptian government , surrendering to the perennial Cairo housing shortage , has provided the cemeteries with a modicum of water and electricity-a humane version of American big cities ' just giving up and getting Target to provide the homeless with snappy Michael Graves-designed trash bags to sleep under . According to Peter , there are postmortem sublets in the so-called City of the Dead . The tenant of record 's heirs charge rent to the viable occupants , who have to make themselves scarce on holidays and other special occasions , when bereaved families come to picnic or even spend the night with the deceased . Peter said there have been squatters among the tombs since the fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further in Egypt  --  and so , maybe , do the squats . Perhaps disaffected experimental colossus carvers , young barley-beer addicts , and aspiring scribes with papyrus sheets full of edgy new hieroglyphics had crash pads in the Great Pyramid of Khufu . Peter and I went ten miles south to Memphis , the capital of Egypt during most of pharaonic times . For three and a half millennia Memphis was the most important city in the country . Then , in the tenth century , the Fatimid general Jauhar AM Rumi pillaged its stones to build Cairo . The dikes were neglected . And now Memphis is gone beneath the silt of the Nile . But the former capital 's necropolis , Saqqara , survives , marked by the Step Pyramid of Djoser . The Step Pyramid was completed about 2635 B.C. Peter said , " This was the world 's first stone building . " I said , " In a country that 's nothing but stone , with not a tree for miles , surely somebody ... " The ancient Egyptians , " Peter said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stone-to last for eternity . " Most of Saqqara has collapsed into rubble . Nearby is the Bent Pyramid . " This was the first pyramid of the true smooth-sided type , " Peter said . To me it looked like a monument to middle-aged adultery-an affair begun with an aggressive angle of attack that could n't be maintained . Apparently , building a pyramid was less straightforwardly Herculean than one might think . Peter explained , though not in these words , that there was more to it than making the top pointy so that the ancient Egyptians would know when to stop . Peter said the craft of pyramid building required a hundred years to perfect . Leaving five pharaohs under large but irregular piles of stuff . We went into the tomb of Mereruka , son-in-law of Pharaoh Teti , who reigned from 2355 to 2343 B.C. This tomb was a mastaba , a flat-roofed stone building , with thirty-three rooms . Peter claimed that only royals were allowed to depict the gods in their burial chambers , so Mereruka decorated his with scenes from daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nice-looking family with plenty of household help . Frequent gourmet meals are served . There 's surround-sound lute playing , many buff dancing girls , and goldsmiths coming up with something bound to placate the missus . Packs of happy naked kids-it must have been a progressive day-care center-play tug-of-war and Johnny-on-a-pony . Travel is as adventurous as anything in an Abercrombie &; Kent brochure . Mereruka is shown spearing hippos ( probably the bungee jumping of its day ) . And one whole wall is devoted to a lively illustration of revenue enhancement . Serf personnel are-to put it in modern terms-allowing their 401(k)s to be used to purchase the corporation 's own stock ( at the urging of supervisors with sticks ) . // Mereruka did well for himself while his wife 's dad was running the show . I was looking at a recognizable yuppie paradise . Nothing here would have been strange to the Reagan merger-and-acquisition years or the dot-com boom . All it lacked was golf . And yet I was also looking at thirty-three rooms of tomb , every one of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer-label kilts and sandals , supermodel-endorsed eye kohl , vintage grand-cru palm-sap wine , and enough meals-to-go to last forever , not to mention archaeological treasures and priceless items of ancient Egyptian art . Plus there was that mummification , which probably cost more than a year at a spa . Merer-aka had invested the proceeds of his peak earning years in worm 's meat . I was standing in what amounted to his Aspen ski lodge , his Hamptons beach house , his Gulfstream jet , the professional sports team he never owned , the college education of his kids . ( And in the event , Mereruka 's tomb was never finished . Teti 's successor , Pepy I , may have been one of those churlish brothers-in-law determined to get the deadwood out of the family business . ) There 's a temptation to think that understanding an ancient culture is easier , or at least less hectic , than understanding its modern offspring . The ancient culture holds still for inspection and does n't produce mysterious new phenomena , such as Cairo . But giant burial vaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . Riches could have been channeled into more-productive use . Channeled literally , as in digging a canal across the flatland between the Nile Delta and the Gulf of Suez . But none was dug until after Darius , the Persian Emperor , had conquered Egypt , in the sixth century B.C. Instead , when pharaohs wanted to trade along the Red Sea coast , they dismantled their boats , hauled them through the eastern desert , and put them back together . The Egyptians did not smelt iron . They did n't even discover bronze until the Middle Kingdom , a thousand years after the civilization was founded . Irrigation was accomplished with buckets on the ends of long levers or by carrying pots slung from yokes . The water wheel was n't introduced until the Persian invasion . And before the Persians there was n't such a thing as money . The ancient Egyptian technological innovation of note ( besides the enormous triangular four-sided sepulchre stack ) was papyrus paper . According to the Egyptologist Cyril Aldred , the ready availability of paper " made the highly organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the Egyptian peasantry paid 50 percent of its produce in taxes . Even so , I felt that I emerged from Mereruka 's tomb into a poorer , more woebegone country . Of course , I did n't . Modern Egypt has a per capita gross domestic product of $3,600 . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that before the Industrial Revolution , world per capita GDP was about $650 ( in 1990 dollars ) . In 1820 Great Britain was the richest country on earth with a per capita GDP of only $1,756 . In wealth-per-person terms , merrie olde England was a Ghana . The ancient world seems rich to us because its DVDs of Sex and the City have survived rather than its kinescopes of The Honeymooners . And disparities in income , so shocking to our contemporary sensibilities , ca n't have been less . Consider the negative net worth of the slaves . They did n't have a title to , or even a mortgage on , themselves . That said , in the fields and palm groves along the Nile are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Teti and Pepy . Identical homes are on display in miniature at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo-part of the Legoland of peasantry and servitude that was placed as an offering in a pharaoh 's crypt . These Nile-side domiciles , in contrast to the City of the Dead , have been supplied with few electrical wires . Running water has in fact been taken away . Nile floods are now contained by the Aswan High Dam , and Egypt 's fellaheen must use commercial fertilizer to do the job that muck did for eons . So the farmers in their millions move to Cairo , and between the remaining wattle-and-daub homesteads rise the weekend villas of plutocrat Cairenes . The villas would do credit to any gated community in Boca Raton . But the villas are the product of a path to success unfamiliar to Boca ( if not to Mereruka ) . " Who can afford these places ? " I asked Peter , who has a Ph.D . in Egyptology , as does his wife . They struggle to support two kids . " Officials , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are steeper . Peter took me to one of the numerous " carpet schools " along the MemphisGiza road . Here children aged ten and up were engaged in-pedagogical alibis and apprenticeship hooey aside  --  child labor . Also , some of the children looked more like eight than ten . There was nothing Dickensian about the well-lit , swept , and airy ground floor full of looms . The manager said that the boys and girls were paid " to give them encouragement " and that " maybe they 'll be able to get a job in the company 's factory . " But I had a feeling this was the factory . He assured me that his charges receive academic instruction similar to that in the government schools . And maybe they do . Scribbled on one weaving frame was graffiti in English that read , " I will always be looting you . " I watched little-kid fingers move with blurring speed among warp and woof and saw little-kid faces puckered in grim expertise . I 'll never buy a handmade rug again . Although I bought one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September eleven is like a black day to us ; the manager said . Is rug weaving really any worse than Play Station II ? Maybe not ; but since I got back from Egypt , wall-to-wall carpet made on automatic machines by unionized labor is looking better-the orange shag kind included . To blame the existence of al Qaeda on poverty like Egypt 's is a slur on the poor . The September 11 attackers were taking flying lessons in America , not rug-weaving lessons in a village on the Nile . Yet there must be some economic , or political-economic , roots to the burning - flaming , bursting , exploding-bush of current events . Fouad Ajami , the author of The Dream Palace of the Arabs and a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , has written , " Atta struck at us because he could not take down Mr. Mubarak 's world , because in the burdened , crowded land of the Egyptian dictator there is very little offered younger Egyptians save for the steady narcotic of anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism . " Narcotics aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Arab culture . Why has Egypt-and the whole Arab world-made relatively little economic progress ? Even the oil-flush Gulf states have not become rich the way we understand rich in the West . Kuwait is little more than an oil spigot with people sitting on top , and all they have to do is turn the tap . But Kuwait 's per capita GDP is $15,000 , whereas utterly resourceless Luxembourg 's is $36,400 . Egypt of yore may have been economically sclerotic , but modern Egyptians ca n't really blame their ancient civilization . At least they had a civilization , which is more than we did-or , to judge by Jenny Jones , do yet . And Islam did n't destroy that civilization any more than the Ptolemites , the Romans , and the Byzantines had before . The capitulation of Egypt to the Arabs was brokered by the Christian Patriarch of Alexandria in 642 , on condition of security for persons and property and with religious freedom guaranteed in return for payment of tribute . The Arab world began with a number of economic advantages besides tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and territory that sat athwart the trade from the Orient to the Mediterranean , between the Mongols and the deep blue sea . To move goods by any other route was to risk getting very wet , or dying . The obligation of pilgrimage stimulated commerce and encouraged the general public to travel the way nothing else would until the invention of frequent-flyer miles and Disney World . A measure of law and order existed , unlike in Europe , where there was none , and in China , where there was too much . And Arabs had absorbed the learning of Greco-Roman civilization centuries before Europeans , in their Renaissance , began to pick scraps of it out of the ruin they 'd made of Greece and Rome . Also , the Islamic religion has the right attitude . In the Koran , Sura II , verse 275 , states , " God hath permitted trade " The Koran orders the use of honest weights and measures , the fulfillment of contracts , and the payment of debts . And one of the sayings attributed to Muhammad makes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam Smith : " Only God can fix prices . " But something went wrong . How did the Arabs fall behind Europe , America , and now the Far East ? It was probably nothing so air-filled as " the experimental model and European rational thought " or " the Protestant work ethic " or " Confucian values " Civilizations , like people , trip over smaller things . The answer may be as boring as a real-estate title search . Caliphs and sultans did not bestow feudal lands on a hereditary nobility . Fiefs were generally temporary . Land was given to a particular person for a certain time in return for military or other services . Agricultural estates were your salary . You got a raise by squeezing everything you could out of them . And you had to do it quickly , before you lost your job . There was no incentive to invest in the land , much less in the people who tilled it . This was a carnival concession . You were never going to see these rubes again .

Farming in much of the area requires irrigation , a horribly communal activity , like being trapped in an endless Amish barn raising . Then the people of the region went and invented writing . Writing is the enabler of bureaucracy . Bureaucracy leads to the Department of Motor Vehicles model of government , with patronage jobs , wire pulling , and a political hack of a boss . The Muslim conquerors of the Fertile Crescent may have come from independent and roughly democratic Arab tribes , but they quickly glommed on to state power , as did their Seljuk and Ottoman Turk successors . Despite the laissezfaire prescriptions of the Koran , and the Prophet 's warnings against price controls , the Islamic state proceeded to interfere grossly with the economy . The pre-eminent Western historian of Islam , Bernard Lewis , estimates that Middle Eastern agricultural yields began a decline in late Roman times that has continued almost to the present day . As for commerce , Lewis has written , " Governments seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year by taxing the pepper trade , they could earn even more by taking it over entirely . " This works so well in Cuba . Lewis argues that Islamic commercial wealth was not destroyed by European innovations in ocean shipping . Rather , Europeans were driven to the sea lanes because in the 1400s the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt nationalized the spice trade and forced the Kmart of nutmeg  --  and-ginger caravans into Chapter 11 . The economic decline can be measured by the number of people the economy was able to support . The Egyptian historian Afaf Marsot believes that the population of Egypt at the time of the Arab conquest was 20 to 30 million . By the late 1700s it was about three million . Mamluk Sultan-ish behavior persisted into the modern era . Gamal Abdel Nasser ruled Egypt from 1952 to 1970 , and his political slogan said everything that can be said about centralization : " We are all Nasser .

Marsot says of the Nasser regime , " The real administration was carried out through exceptional decrees , through patron-client relationships , through appeals to individuals in power . " Sounds like Enron to me . But Alan Greenspan says America 's economy is doing okay . And so , to some extent , is Egypt 's . Reforms and privatizations were begun by Anwar Sadat and have continued under Hosni Mubarak . Egypt 's GDP grew by an average of 5.05 percent a year from 1997 to 2000. 1 had dinner with some Egyptians in the steel business . Their business talk sounded like any business talk .

He was interested to hear about the L. L. Bean boat bag and how there are people called WASPs in America who ca n't so much as send a kid and the nanny to the beach club without employing three or four of these stiff cotton sacks . I had lunch with an Egyptian who had been born in the United States . When he was in high school , in suburban Chicago , he became serious about religion and observed Ramadan with rigor . Then he went to Egypt to work as a journalist , and now , in Ramadan , he was having lunch . " My sister is a Christian fundamentalist , " I said .

And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lot of people do n't make that connection " the Egyptian journalist from Chicago said . But the movement of Egypt 's material culture into the modern age is not happening fast enough to simply turn them into us . ( And since I began watching Maury Povich , I 'm not sure I want it to . ) Also , a small item in the December 10 , 2001 , edition of The Egyptian Gazette indicates that the fatal bull's-eye of centralization remains pinned to the Egyptian economy . " Minister of Planning Othman Mohammed Othman ; ' the item read , " said the government was unable to manage the economy alone . " Plus , Egypt continues to suffer from the corruption that 's bred when profit lies down with politics . Transparency International 's 2001 Corruption Perceptions Index rates Egypt 3.6 on a scale of 10 , with 10 being the least corrupt . Finland is 9.9 . Drug-lord-beleaguered Colombia , at 3.8 , is less corrupt than Egypt . Five millennia of economic tomfoolery is bound to leave Egyptians confused about economic principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who writes the front-page " Tell Me More " column for The Egyptian Gazette , can sound like Pat Buchanan on a bad chest-hair day . " Immediate restrictions must be introduced to drastically reduce imports , " Ibrahim wrote on December 5 , 2001 . " We waste millions of dollars on provocative imported commodities , dog food , nuts and ice cream . ' Ibrahim cited the work of Mahmoud Bazaraa , " an economics expert " who claims " that a liberal economy does n't mean opening wide the doors for imports " A few days later Ibrahim 's column was titled " Tell Me More ... About imported prayer beads , how they 're bankrupting local merchants . " " In the United States , " I said to Peter , " we 're worried about Egyptian Islamic extremism . So what 's with all the crosses on the Cairo skyline ? " " I 'm Christian , " Peter said . The owners of his tour company are also Christians , as are most of its employees . " How many Egyptians are Christian ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I do n't know how many . " Most Egyptian Christians are members of the Coptic Church . Fouad Ajami writes , " The demographic weight of the Copts is one of the great riddles of Egypt " Ajami quotes the political historian Rifaat Said , who says , " We count everything in Egypt : cups , shoes , books . The only thing we do n't count are the Copts . ' Copts make up six percent of the Egyptian population ( the official estimate ) or 10 percent ( the historian Afaf Marsot 's estimate ) or 12 percent ( the estimate from the Center for Religious Freedom , in Washington , D.C. ) Only 11 percent of Swedes go to church . Egypt may be a more Christian country than Sweden . Copts believe that the nature of Jesus Christ was completely divine . Other Christians believe that the nature of Jesus was both divine and human . This used to be something you could get killed over . And it still is . Muslims believe that the nature of Jesus was just plain human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as at foreign tourists . In January of 2000 , in the town of Al-Kosheh , anti-Copt rioting resulted in the death of twenty-two Christians and one Muslim . But Afaf Marsot claims that the Copts were treated better by their Muslim conquerors than by their Byzantine overlords , who considered them heretics . Copts were incorporated into the Arab government . Bernard Lewis says that as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Muslims were complaining that Copts were running the administration . They 're still there . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , a Copt , was Mubarak 's deputy prime minister for foreign affairs before becoming Secretary-General of the UN . Peter took me to the Coptic quarter of Cairo . We saw a welter of Christian worship going on-although it was a weekday-and more than a few Santa decorations . Peter showed me where Pharaoh 's daughter found Moses floating in a basket . The basement grotto was flooded , so this may have been the spot . No , I 'm getting mixed up in my notes . The flooded grotto was the place where Jesus and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope they brought galoshes . The Church of Saint Sergius , one of the oldest Christian churches in Egypt , was constructed over the grotto , in the fifth century . To support one end of a door lintel in the church a Roman column was used with its capital flat on the floor-in case you think it 's only Muslims who turn civilization upside down . // The place where Moses was found is in the Ben Ezra Synagogue , which is no longer used for daily worship . " Fewer than a hundred Jews are left in Egypt " Peter said . " All of them are over seventy . There are maybe twenty synagogues in Egypt . Only one is open . " When Ben Ezra was restored in the nineteenth century , thousands of manuscripts were discovered , dating back to the eleventh century . " It is the habit of the Jews all over the world , " Peter said , " to write the story of their lives and hide these writings in certain places . ' I was thinking of Anne Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " the closed society of the Jews " and said , " We do not forget the help the Jews gave the Hyksos . " These were the pharaohs of the Fifteenth Dynasty , apparently of Semitic origin , who ruled Egypt after the fall of the Middle Kingdom , 3,650 years ago . Peter was still irked . " The Jews came to Egypt three times ; ' he said , frowning , " with Joseph , with Ptolemy , and in 1492 " By the way , they were moderately well treated on each occasion-although there seems to have been a flare-up of ill feeling about the time of Exodus . And now , of course . The big hit from Egypt 's pop singer of the moment , Shaaban Abdel Rahim , is " Ana Bakrah Israel " ( ' I Hate Israel " ) . Rahim says the cassette has sold five million copies . In a week 's worth of Egyptian Gazettes , each edition only eight to twelve pages long , I counted fifty-eight articles involving Israel . The December 12 , 2001 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front page . One piece , on December 10 , cited " rumours that Mossad agents have secretly hidden magnetic strips inside Cleopatra cigarettes " The story noted that " strong electromagnetic fields are a health risk " and went on to mention " ' lethal " magnetic belt buckles , seen as an Israeli plot to make Egyptians sterile . " The Egyptian Gazette , which the Lonely Planet guide calls " Egypt 's awful daily English-language newspaper , " is an anodyne ( and anti-Osama ) publication that turns up outside hotel-room doors in the morning and is clearly meant to be read by foreigners , some of whom are likely to be Jewish . Much worse things are available from the Arab  --  language press , as is pointed out by The Middle East Media and Research Institute , a pro-Israel organization that colleas much worse things from the Arab-language press . According to MEMRI , the following items appeared in the Egyptian government dailies 41-Al-Akhbar and , 41-Ahram from April to August of 2001 : Mahmoud Mahmoud Muhammad Khadhr , a cleric from Cairo 's Al-Azhar University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews or did their crime deserve even more ? ... The Zionists were a fifth column in Germany , and they betrayed the country that hosted them . " Dr. Mahmoud Al-Said Al-Kurdi stated , " The Talmud , the second holiest book for the Jews , determines that the " matzahs " of Atonement Day must be kneaded with blood ' from a non-Jew . The preference is for the blood of youths after raping them ! ! " And the journalist Fahmi Huweidi described his feelings after a suicide bombing : " I can not hide my happiness about the martyrdom operation that took place in Jerusalem last Thursday . I wo n't deny that it liberated me from the sorrow and misery that have overtaken me over the past weeks . " Fouad Ajami 's " narcotic of anti-Zionism " packs a punch . And maybe so does poetic license . In The Dream Palace of the Arabs , Ajami explains that Arab society puts a great value on poetic expression-a 1950s-Smith-College-girl  --  **25;1407;TOOLONG value . In the March 10 , 2002 , New York Times Book Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetry on one of his videotapes ( a poem plagiarized from the Jordanian poet Yusuf Abu Hilalah ) . Shulevitz said that this recitation " would burnish bin Laden 's reputation in a way that Americans might not readily understand , given the higher premium placed in the Middle East on poetic eloquence , even in a political leader : And it is hard to imagine George W. Bush cribbing from Sylvia Plath in his post-September 11 address to the joint session of Congress : Out of the ash I rise with my red hair And I eat men like air . Ajami quotes the poet Nizar Qabbani , who said that the Arab is the " quintessential poetic being : " and that poetry is " written on the forehead of every Arab . " Anyone who has had a similar experience of letting his words get ahead of his frontal lobes knows where this can lead . Maybe , in the calumnies of Al-Akhbar , there is a kinship to Plath 's poem " Daddy ; in which she addressed her father : " Panzer-man , panzer-man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of biology and an expert on bees . Or maybe what we 're hearing in Al-Akhbar is prosaic hate . But either way , the reality is that it 's been almost thirty years since the last war between Egypt and Israel . Americans in my parents ' generation were pretty mad at the Japs . They got over it . And by the 1970s they were driving Datsuns . I flew to Luxor . Trying to understand a culture by being a tourist is famously useless . But trying to understand Egypt without being a tourist would be worse than useless . Egypt is the cradle of tourism . Herodotus was a tourist here in the fifth century B.C. And the First Dynasty of the pharaohs was as far removed in time from Herodotus as he is from us . Tourism was the source of history 's original failure of cultural understanding . Cyril Aldred writes that ancient Greek and Roman vacationers in Egypt " never really understood Egyptian religion and were inclined to see in inexplicable acts and beliefs a more profound significance than actually existed . " Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " mysterious East . " Luxor is the site of the ancient sacred city of Thebes , 419 miles upstream from Cairo . The Temple of Luxor is downtown , and nearby are the Colossi of Memnon , Karnak Temple , Hatshepsut 's Temple , the Valley of the Kings , the Valley of the Queens , and the Ramesseum , with the gigantic shattered statue of Ramses II that inspired Shelley to write " Ozymandias . " And on the pedestal these words appear : " My name is Ozymandias , king of kings : Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! " Nothing beside remains . Round the decay Of that colossal wreck other than ticket booths , soda-pop stands , souvenir stalls , dozing guards , and 200 men in galabias asking " Whereyoufrom Youbuypostcardokay ? " At the Sheraton hotel in Luxor a few tourists were braving the geopolitics-some Europeans , a couple of Japanese , and a scattering of doughty American retirees of the type who ca n't get along without L. L. Bean boat bags . I heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English accent , " The reason I got fired ... " My guide in Luxor , Ibrahim , was one of those people  --  rare among tour guides-who are impelled to tell the truth . His description of the mummification process was sickening . I asked Ibrahim about the war on terror . " Egyptians support America 's actions in Afghanistan , " he said , and paused . " Most do . But I must tell you the truth , others do not . Maybe thirty percent do . I am Christian . All Christians support America 's actions . " He paused again . " But maybe ninety percent of Egyptians are opposed . " Luxor 's tombs and temples were interesting-briefly . Ibrahim would recount the attributes , the ancestry , and the avatars of every mythological figure portrayed . He came to a brief , embarrassed halt only at Min , who is represented with a healthy erection . And so Min might well be represented , given the lithesome and un-burka 'd female deities on the tomb and temple walls . The ancient Egyptian pantheon seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an earlier edition . But the mild thrill of anachronistic eroticism wears off , the gimmick of puppy-headed gods palls , and a satiety with ritual mumbo-jumbo sets in . Too much Egyptian art in a day produces moods that go rapidly from Hobbit-jaded to child-wizard-bored to the feeling of being in a vegetarian restaurant with a blind date who 's talking feng shui . Ibrahim took me to just such a restaurant near the Valley of the Kings , although it became vegetarian only after Ibrahim suggested I look in the kitchen . From the restaurant 's terrace I could also look up and down the Nile . The land of Egypt is nearly 700 miles long and , for most of that distance , effectively about seven miles wide . How did this affect a culture ? Did people try to make their lives long and narrow ? The funerary monuments around Luxor are a huge pharaonic Keogh plan meant to fund an eternal hereafter just like the therebefore . I could be wrong . What will be left of our civilization 5,000 years hence ? Probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some future age will wonder , as I wondered at the Valley of the Kings , " Why were these people so obsessed with where they were going instead of where they were ? " But our rest stops wo n't present the same opportunities for looting . ( " A Jersey Devils snow dome ! " ) All the ancient Egyptian tombs were robbed , many by contemporaries of the deceased . Even the famed trove of Tutankhamun was picked over not long after it was sealed . Suspicions arise of an inside job . A pharaoh 's kids had motive , means , and opportunity . They 'd been bilked of their inheritance , knew where the tomb was , and were paying the salaries of the guards . " Did n't Grandpa have a set of solid-gold dinner plates just like this ? " " Finish your papyrus fries " Nowadays the tombs are well protected . And so are their visitors . After the 1997 terrorist attack at Hatshepsut 's Temple , the corps of black-dad Tourist Police was expanded and given special training . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furby hanging from the rearview mirror . The Tourist Police were present in force at the Karnak temple complex . Karnak covers almost as much ground as Disneyland . The Great Hypostyle Hall alone has space enough for a heck of an Ancient Egyptian Adventure ride  --  whizzing among the 134 gigantic stone pillars . Indeed , visitors once came to Karnak with a more Disney-fled attitude . According to the scrapbooks of nineteenth-century tourists , there 's room for a hundred men to stand on the capital of one of these columns . That was the kind of culturally insensitive thing tourists used to do . Now they 're herded into sound-and-light shows . // The Karnak son et lumiere began with Wagnerian music and recorded male and female voices bouncing back and forth between widely separated speakers in the manner of sound-effects records from the early days of stereo . I forget what the female voice was pretending to be . The male voice was Amon-Ra-a Middle Kingdom syncretism of Ra the sun deity and a local goose god , the Great Cackler , who laid the cosmic egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that bin Laden is snapping his fingers to in the coffeehouses of the Shah-i-Kot Valley . " I am Amon-Ra , " the male voice said . " The waters of the Nile sprout from my sandals . " The lumiere part consisted mostly of plunging us into darkness while we hung around in the supposedly spiritual ruins . Some of the tourists took flash photos of the opacity . " Yes , definitely spirits , " I heard one woman say . A Ramadan service was being broadcast over the loudspeaker of a mosque outside the Karnak walls . The son et lumiere producers turned up their volume . The Muslim clerics turned up theirs . The producers responded in kind . So did the clerics . If the pious Muslims had had Ibrahim translating the son et lumiere into Arabic , there might have been more than a war of words . " I am the father of fathers , mother of mothers ; Amon-Ra announced very loudly indeed , " ... the salvation of Amon , the salvation of Ra , also the salvation of the crocodile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to you , new pilgrim to Thebes . " I was reminded of nothing so much as my dad in a fez , headed out for a night with the boys . Dad was a Thirty  --  second Degree Freemason and a member of the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine . It 's hard to imagine a worse case of cultural misunderstanding than the cultures of Egypt and Arabia represented by Dad on a midget motorcycle in the Fourth of July parade . Or maybe Dad knew more than I thought . During the late nineteenth century Egypt 's King Tawfiq was a member of a Masonic lodge , as were many of Egypt 's reform-minded liberal elite . The next night I visited the Temple of Luxor , mercifully in silence . Luxor was consecrated to the " Theban Thad " : Amon-Ra ; his earth-mother consort , Mut ; and their moongod kid , Khonsu . The temple was constructed about 1300 B.C. and restored by Alexander the Great , who built a new sanctuary for Amon-Ra . " In the wrong place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last room of the temple , not here in the antechamber . " Alexander 's sanctuary stands just inside the antechamber 's original walls . One set of hieroglyphs and reliefs was carved a thousand years later than the other . " You see the difference , " Ibrahim said . I did n't . There is a supposed dynamism to ancient Egyptian art According to Cyril Aldred , " It is often possible for the expert to date a specimen to within a few years by its stylistic features alone " So the expert says . But the ancient Egyptian language , Aldred himself points out , " has no genuine active tense . " He notes that the ancient Egyptians did not adjust their calendar with the addition of an extra day every four years . They just let it slide for a millennium and a half until it got back into phase . When it came to art , I think the ancient Egyptians had a look going and decided to hang with it for 3,000 years . " Notice how the quality of decoration degenerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding is to understand that not all cultures progress . Ibrahim and I went across the street and had dinner at McDonald 's , where the quality of decoration had degenerated much further . Author Affiliation P.J.
