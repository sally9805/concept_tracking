<p> She has lived in public housing most of her life . Her ex-boyfriend , the father of two of her three kids , once cracked her skull with a weight . He tried to strangle her with a phone cord . The abuse went on for years . <p> The man , a drug addict , never paid his dealers , so they came after Moore instead . She spent much of her time at home , protecting her apartment and children . <p> The old boyfriend is in prison now , but life remains tough . Moore has lived off welfare for 14 years , but her cash benefits soon will end , and she has never held a job . <p> The Chicago Housing Authority has tried to help Moore , tried to show her the way to a better life . <p> A counselor at a new social service center at the Ida B. Wells Homes on the Near South Side sat down with her . She urged Moore to try domestic-abuse counseling . She urged her to enroll her children in an after-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got so much on my mind , I 'm not ready to make that step , " she said recently , days before her 30th birthday . " I 'll get around to it . " <p> Two years ago , the CHA promised to make an effort , unprecedented in scope , to help people like Linda Moore . It pledged to transform public housing  --  rebuilding not just the bricks and mortar but the tenants themselves , helping to change the way the hard-core poor live , work and even think . <p> But , as Moore 's story suggests , it 's not working for the hardest cases . Success stories exist , but they tend to feature tenants who were self-starters  --  people who came looking for help . <p> It may be that the CHA , nobly but naively , took on an impossible job . Or it may be too soon to say . The CHA 's key program to link residents with jobs , day care or counseling is only seven months old  --  and changing lives takes time . <p> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a legitimate effort , launching a program so underfunded and understaffed that it was destined to fail . <p> " If people have developed anti-social behavior over three generations , it 'll take more than we have to get them into mainstream society , " said a top administrator associated with the program , one of many who did n't want to be identified for fear of jeopardizing their CHA contracts . " This raises questions about the CHA 's commitment ... The level of commitment is n't there . " <p> And meanwhile , the clock is ticking . <p> The CHA 's high-rises are coming down , and , under new rules , families will have to meet tough lease requirements to get housing elsewhere . At a minimum , they 'll have to pay rent , keep a clean house and avoid breaking the law while in temporary housing . And at some mixed-income communities the CHA plans to build , the bar will be higher . Tenants may be required to take drug tests and hold a job . <p> Many current CHA tenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could end up on the streets . <p> How it works <p> The CHA 's " Service Connector " program starts with a simple premise . Set up 25 small centers , one each at most of the city 's family developments . Staff them with residents and social work professionals who know the social services nearby . Get residents to come in and talk about what they need  --  be it day care , job training or rehab  --  and then send them out to get help . <p> But so far , the program seems to have missed a major chunk of families . It has little to offer for people who ca n't or wo n't ask for help , people limited by illiteracy , heroin abuse and criminal records . <p> This could be as many as 40 percent of the people still living in the projects , several experts said . <p> " This is the underbelly , " said Benjamin J. Kendrick , a veteran social service provider and head of the Marcy-Newberry Association , one of six agencies hired to run the Service Connector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy . " <p> The program also excludes a major segment of the CHA 's troubled population  --  squatters who live illegally with relatives . <p> CHA officials insist it 's too early to judge the new Service Connector program , but they point out that in seven months it has directed 5,700 families to various social services and linked 700 residents with full-time or part-time jobs . Other observers applaud the CHA 's efforts thus far , saying the agency and the city Department of Human Services , which manages the $5.9 million Service Connector program , are tackling problems that were ignored for decades . <p> CHA officials also stress that the Service Connector program allows for refinements along the way . A roving group of case workers , for example , will start scouring a few of the housing developments this year , trying to root out the toughest cases . <p> " Those are the ones you have to go and get and invest heavy , heavy resources  --  but even then you do n't know if they 'll follow through , " said Isabel Blanco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program does n't say we 're going to make you . " <p> A success story <p> Rossanna Wyatt is one of the people who came looking for help . <p> For years , she struggled with depression and alcohol . At 32 years old , she simply could n't imagine a better life . <p> " I really felt that I was stuck over here with no way out , " said Wyatt , who lives in the Lathrop Homes on the North Side . <p> But after seeing a flier about the Service Connector program , Wyatt agreed to meet with a case manager . With his help , she went into counseling for her drinking problem and sent one of her two sons to anger-management classes . <p> She also found a job with a private company , signing up public housing families for health benefits . After a decade stocking groceries and working security , it 's her first job with real career potential . <p> " I 've never had anything like this in the neighborhood , " Wyatt said , a soft smile spreading across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . " I spent a lot of time here . I really needed someone to lean on . " <p> Like Wyatt , many women are already better off because of the Service Connector program . Some did n't need much help . But looking ahead to the challenge of reaching people like Linda Moore , the assessments turn grim . <p> " There is no evidence that a system like this will do it , " said Toby Herr , a senior researcher at the Erikson Institute who created a nationally recognized welfare-to-work model . " From the CHA perspective this program seems major , but from the family 's perspective it does n't do the trick . " <p> Herr questions the CHA 's logic , saying the entrenched , overlapping problems many people face ca n't be solved by isolating each one and shipping someone off to get them fixed . <p> And if you 're going to try it , says the Metropolitan Planning Council , you need a lot more bodies . With 112 staff positions for about 12,000 families , the ratio of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times higher than in successful programs , according to the council . <p> The prognosis is at its bleakest on the State Street corridor . The two firms that manage the Service Connector offices took too long to hire staff and get organized , Blanco said , and they did n't do a good job documenting what they were up to . Other critics say the firms hired unqualified staff . <p> Blanco said both firms have been doing better since January , hooking more people up with jobs and social services . A reporter 's visit to two sites run by The Woodlawn Organization showed that improvements had been made since a fall visit . But at the Robert Taylor Homes , a William Moorehead &; Associates site , many residents had never heard of the Service Connector centers . <p> Last month , Moorehead 's Al Burns explained that he was still understaffed because his firm had not been paid in months . City officials denied that . Soon after , Burns reported getting a payment . He added staff early this month . <p> Money matters <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other . But it could improve the odds . <p> More money could translate into help for CHA squatters , people who double up illegally with family members . The CHA is limited by the federal government from spending money on squatters and is negotiating to get around that . By some estimates , 10,000 or more people are living off the books . <p> Extra money could buy more case managers  --  professionals experienced in helping people take the small steps needed to start anew . The Mid-America Institute on Poverty looked at the Service Connector program last year and recommended increasing the number of case managers to 96 from 35 . <p> In that study , researchers concluded that at least 25 percent of the people left in the projects would likely need intensive help from case managers to deal with mental illness , substance abuse or domestic violence . Several experienced Service Connector managers suspect that rate could be as high as 40 percent . <p> Now , most centers have one or two case managers , and one social worker serves several developments . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of being able to gain the trust of other residents , but most have limited professional experience . <p> Blanco said there are plenty of caseworkers available through the city 's network of agencies and insists that residents are thoroughly interviewed to assess their needs before they are sent out for help . <p> But critics maintain there are n't enough quality programs for residents to be sent to , particularly if they are ex-offenders or drug addicts . The city has encouraged the agencies it funds to make CHA families a priority , but many say it 's not happening fast enough . It may take time , Blanco responded , but word is coming straight from the mayor 's office to make room for CHA residents . <p> " We 've thrown money at problems for a long time , " she said , noting the $190 million the city spends on social services annually . " Every available service has to be aligned . That 's different than saying the CHA needs more money . " <p> For now , no one can say for sure whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few months , the CHA will begin tracking people after they are sent to a job training program or to rehab . This new system will let the CHA know if the programs have space and how many people are actually following through . <p> " When this program kicked off , we recognized that we did n't know everything about what would be required to serve residents adequately , " said Wgoan Le , a city Department of Human Services deputy commissioner . " For me , it 's putting in place a minimum infrastructure that would , at least , respond to a group that comes in on their own . What we need to do is build on that infrastructure . " <p> But will it be too little , too late ? <p> " Many residents have reached such a low level that there is no connection with positive streams of the community , " Kendrick said . " There has been a mind-set that you can stay in public housing forever . People have created a mentality that is now totally unacceptable . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that this is the last train . "
