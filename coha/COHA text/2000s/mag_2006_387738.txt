Colin walked slowly home from school , scuffing his feet . He looked across the hills at the little Irish fishing village . It did not seem like Christmas Eve . Perhaps this was because it still had not snowed . But Colin knew there was another reason why it did not seem like Christmas-a reason he did not dare whisper even in his heart . He looked toward the lead-colored sea . There was not a single ship on the horizon . And seven days ago his father 's fishing schooner had been due home . " I 'll bring you a sheep dog pup from the Shetland Isles , " Colin 's father told him the morning he left . " Ye 'll have it a week before Christmas , I am certain . " But now it was Christmas Eve . Colin looked toward the lighthouse , high on the hill . Seven days ago , a storm had short-circuited the lighthouse wires . The great beacon 's light had been snuffed out . For seven days , there had been no light to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cottage . " We 'll need more peat for the fire , Colin , " said his mother as he entered . " It has burned itself out . And it 's near time to light the Christmas candle . " " I 'm not carin " much about lightin ' a candle , Mother , " he said . " Aye , I know , for Tm not carin " much either , " replied his mother . " But everybody in Ireland lights a candle on Christmas Eve . Even when there 's sadness in the house , you must light the candle . It shows that your house and heart are open to strangers . Come now , I 've two candles , one for each of us . If you gather some peat , we 'll be ready for supper soon . " Colin nodded and went outside . He led their donkey up the hill so that he could gather the peat . " Who cares about a silly candle , " he said as he glanced toward the lighthouse , " when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide a fishin ' boat home ? " The donkey shook his head and brayed sadly , as if he understood . But while he was staring at the lighthouse , Colin had an idea . It hit him like a gust of warm spring wind . He started running up the long hill . When he came to the lighthouse , he pounded on the door . Mr. Duffy , the keeper , opened the door . " What 's got into you , young fellow ? You startled me-and on Christmas Eve , too ! " " Mr. Duffy , " gasped Colin , " how did you used to light the beacon ? " " Why , with electric batteries . But they are blown , my boy . Dead as can be ! And we wo n't be able to replace them till after the new year . " " No , I mean , how did you light the lighthouse before there were such things as batteries ? " " Well , they used an oil lamp . It 's down in the cellar . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would kerosene light the lamp ? " asked Colin , holding his breath . " Well , I suppose , " Mr. Duffy mused . " But do n't go gettin " silly ideas in your head , lad . You would n't find even a pitiful quart of spare kerosene in this village . Everyone is so poor for money this year ... " Colin was gone before Mr. Duffy could finish his sentence . Down the hill he ran , back to the cottage . Quickly he gathered four pails from the kitchen . Then he darted out the door . Colin could see candles glowing in nearly every cottage in the valley below him . A candle on Christmas Eve meant that a stranger would be welcome and given whatever he asked . He did n't stop running until he came to the first house . " Could you spare me just a half cup of kerosene from your lamp ? " he asked . Colin went to every house where a candie shone in the window . In one hour he had filled two pails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He knocked . " What 's this ? " Mr. Duffy asked . " Laddie , this wo n't keep the lamp burnin ' for more than an hour or so . " " I 'll get more ! " Colin shouted as he started down the hill . " It 's early still . " After three more long hours , Colin had gathered five more pails of kerosene . He was on his way with the sixth pail , when the tower suddenly flickered with light . A great beam spread out over the valley . It stretched toward the dark heart of the sea like a finger pointing home . Mr. Duffy had lighted the lamp ! It was very late when Coun reached home . His mother jumped from her seat near the fire . " Colin , where have you been ? You 've had no supper , nor lighted your candle ! " " Oh , Mother ! I 've lighted a candle , and a big one ! It 's a secret , so I ca n't tell you-yet . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , dreaming of candles . Suddenly , a great shouting aroused him from his sleep . " The boat ! The boat has come in ! " A hundred voices were spinning in his head . " The light-'twas the light they said-the light from the beacon . They were only ten miles away after all . The boat was just a-driftin ' in the fog , lost . " Dawn was breaking . Colin dashed to the window . People were milling around outside . His mother was running toward the harbor . It was true ! There floated his father 's schooner , standing out black as coal against the gray of the sea . Colin darted across the yard and raced for the harbor . He felt a moist wind on his face . It was beginning to snow . Oh , it was Christmas morning all right , falling right from heaven and into his heart ! <p>
