<p> Al Sharpton needs to find his sense of humor <p> The Poles , the Irish , the Swedes , the Jews have all been subjects of humor  --  sometimes insensitive  --  but they have taken it in good humor and dished it out as well . This is called freedom of speech ! ! ! <p> Where is good ol ' Al Sharpton 's outrage when a black rapper has a " song " about killing " Whitey " or some similar outrage ? I think ol ' Al needs to shut his mouth for the first time in his life and get over it ! <p> GORDON HELD , Young Harris <p> The misogyny is hateful too <p> Why should we all hate Don Imus ? It is n't just the " nappy-headed " part . The racism is ugly , but there 's even more on top of that : It 's the misogyny . We 're all distracted by it because of the obvious racial quality of the insult on the Rutgers basketball team , but would people have been screaming had he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being athletes ? These young women were playing for the national championship , and Imus was talking about which ones were rough and which cute . <p> So it 's not just about calling them " nappy-headed . " It 's about reducing them , cruelly mocking women who did nothing more offensive than excel in sports . <p> Yeah , a lot of them are pretty tough . What of it ? With people like Imus around , they have to be . <p> LYNN ZYSKOWSKI , Atlanta <p> Employer needs to fire radio host now <p> Don Imus has stepped over the line once too often . His employer ca n't continue to endorse this racist attacker , and let him cloak his thoughts in humor . His comment about the Rutgers girl 's basketball team was one of the most despicable , racist comments ever uttered . If he continues with his show after being served his slap on the wrist , his employer is as guilty as he is . <p> JANE E. KOCH , Tucker <p> Rap , hip-hop industry just as bad <p> Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive comments were uttered by a white male . While Imus ' comments are deplorable , I heard nothing that is n't broadcast locally on hip-hop radio and purchased daily on CDs and DVDs recorded by rap groups . Will the Jesse Jacksons and Al Sharptons go after the entertainment industry ? What hypocrisy . <p> GERALD TITSHAW , Hampton <p> Why pick on Imus for often-heard language ? <p> Watching the Don Imus Show the other day , I really thought he was coming out of his shell by practicing a witty ditty of a rap song to go along with the Rutgers women 's basketball team 's season . I was surprised that the " I-man " was called on the carpet for his reference to the girls as " nappy-headed hos . " After all , those kind of words and attitudes are in almost every rap song made these days . What did Imus do or say that was different ? <p> JOHNNY JOHNSTON , Ellenwood <p> Imus remark was not racial <p> So now we suspend a man from his job for a thought . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Don Imus really is getting what he deserved . Not . <p> Never have I seen such a blatant cause of hypocrisy by both the media and the " black leaders " like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson . <p> I really do n't think what Imus said was racial . Nowhere in his statement was the belief that one race was superior to another . I do n't listen to Imus , I find him boring but you can bet I will listen for awhile when he comes back for this injustice and hypocrisy that was carried out against him <p> BILL EIDSON , Sharpsburg <p> Time off not enough for prostitute insult <p> I am the mother of three successful African-American women . As such , I am appalled by Imus ' comments about the Rutgers women 's basketball team . I am more appalled by the reaction to those remarks . He gets two weeks vacation for characterizing young college girls as prostitutes . <p> For those not familiar with the street language he used , a " ho " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents must be enraged . They ought to be , and ought to sue Imus and the media that employ him . <p> I am outraged at the response to his degrading remarks . He has maligned a whole race of women : " Nappy-headed " is without a doubt racial , but " ho " is a moral characterization . It is a mean , callous , demeaning , undeserved and unwarranted character assassination . <p> " I 'm sorry " is not enough ; nor is two weeks off . <p> DOLLY DESSELLE ADAMS , Atlanta <p> Imus crew needs a sensitivity course <p> The Italian American One Voice Coalition joins the millions of concerned individuals that find Don Imus ' insensitive , racist and sexist remarks about the Rutgers University women 's basketball team outrageously damaging . <p> We join others in speaking out against all negative stereotyping . <p> This is not the first time Imus and Co. have crossed the line . <p> When Imus ' producer Bernard McGuirk called Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito " some meatball-sucking wop , " we were perhaps the lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of programming . <p> Imus and his crew should use their two-week break off the airwaves to voluntarily enroll in a sensitivity course so that this kind of outrageous , irresponsible behavior does not happen to any group again . <p> The Italian American One Voice Coalition would like to see an end to all negative stereotyping  --  and the Imus show is a prime starting spot . <p> JOHN P. VIVONA , Suwanee <p> It 's wrong to fire for a mistake <p> What Don Imus said was despicable , but to demand he be fired for this error in judgment is just as despicable . We are all humans , and we all have the frailties and shortcomings that come with being human . <p> Apparently , certain men of the cloth would have us believe they sport halos over their heads . They fail to accept : " To err is human ; to forgive is divine " or " Judge not lest ye be judged " or " Let him who is without sin cast the first stone , " or " Forgive us our sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , even Jesus forgave us our sins . <p> SKIP BARTLETT , Tiger
