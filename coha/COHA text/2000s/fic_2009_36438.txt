At 9:37 on Thanksgiving eve , nineteen-year-old Francesca Pena steps from the cramped vestibule of a crappy little apartment building in the East Fifties and hurries north . Model thin and shielded from the cold by only a vintage Adidas warm-up jacket , she leans into the icy wind that seems to hurl cars downtown and squints at the dreary commerce . This stretch of Second has never amounted to much . Tonight , with everyone on the way to families or bracing for their arrival , it 's essentially shut down . The only exceptions are a candy store franchise that just changed hands and an Irish pub with an advertised happy hour that runs from ten in the morning to seven at night . <p> Pena turns west at Fifty-second and with long athletic strides traverses another cheerless block . She passes six-story walk-ups , a basement dry cleaner , another cheerless pub , and the headquarters for the Salvation Army . As always , she winces at the gap-toothed sign with its missing a 's in s l v tion . An NYU sophomore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of neighborhoods , good and bad , but none as unsettling as this shabby bit of midtown fringe , where every endeavor feels dwarfed and mocked by the value of the real estate beneath it . As an antidote to the creepiness as much as the cold , Pena slips a chocolate malt ball into her mouth and picks up her already brisk pace . From Third on , the start of Midtown proper , there are no more random tenements or one-off businesses . There are only franchises and banks and office towers , and as Pena hurries through the emptied-out block , her bloodred jacket and short glistening black hair are the only colors . Thanks to the hotels , Lexington , at least , is well lit , and on the far corner is the glowing entrance to the IRT . When the signal turns , Pena bounds across the street and down the greasy steps , and after an expertly timed swipe of her Metrocard , pushes through the turnstile like a finish line . She barely has time to throw away her used-up card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she climbs up onto Bleecker , she 's so glad to be downtown , the air feels ten degrees warmer and for the first time in what seems like hours , she is aware of the night sky . Seeing that she has fifteen minutes to spare , she makes a quick detour to Tower Records , where she grabs the latest No Doubt CD for Moreal and the latest Britney for Consuela , and after enduring a withering eye roll from the pierced cashier , heads south again . <p> A topless Kate Moss , still freezing her tits off at thirty-one , presides over the intersection of Houston and Lafayette . Pena , very nearly as alluring , crosses under her , setting off flashbulb smiles from the cabbies lined up at the BP station . Safely across , she turns east on Prince . She passes the side of a building plastered with posters for sports drinks , bands , and video games , then hugs the high brick wall that borders the cemetery from Mulberry to Mott . <p> Compared with midtown , Nolita is barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the clogged streets , smokers huddle outside the bars , and as always there 's a crowd waiting to get into CafT Habana . East of Elizabeth , however , the street goes black . On Bowery , the restaurant wholesalers are battened down as if for a storm . Cold , and anxious for her walk to be over , Pena turns east onto Rivington . Half a block later , at the end of a short tight alley , she spots her destination : the four-month-old restaurant/bar called Freemans . <p> <br> Continues ...
