" You 'll Never Add Up to Anything " // I always told Jose and Ozzie , // " Do better next time . " // I 'm obviously a very serious man . // I never fool around with anything . // But I was never stern or a dictator . // Jose Canseco Sr. , // My father // My dad earned a good living in Cuba during the Batista years , working as a territory manager for Esso Standard Oil . He also picked up a little extra cash working nights as an English teacher at the Professional School of Commerce in Havana . He worked hard and was a good provider for our family . As soon as Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 , though , my father was smart enough to know that before long the new leftist system would control the entire country , and that would not be a good thing for people like my father . He figured that everything he had worked for in Cuba would be lost , and he was right , too . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . Then he lost his house . And then his car . // He was in an unusual position in that he had already spent time in the United States studying English . He had gone to Shreveport , Louisiana , as a teenager and lived with an uncle there for several years , starting in 1940 , and his time in American schools gave him enough of a grounding in the language to teach it in Cuba . As much as he would have liked to stay in Cuba , his country , he was also comfortable with the idea of diving into a new life in the United States  --  if that was his only choice . // So my father notified the Cuban government that he wanted to leave the country , and the government basically answered : Tough luck . There was a serious shortage of skilled professionals , and Castro could not afford to lose white-collar workers like my father . The government announced that such workers would only be allowed to emigrate if a specific replacement could be found to handle their particular job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over my father 's job with the oil company . The government wrote him a letter saying that because of his professional ability and expertise , he was not allowed to leave the country until further notice . He would have to wait years for them to change their minds . // My dad was born in 1929 , in a town called Regla , on the outskirts of Havana . Both my father 's parents had come over from Spain and his father , Inocente , had a big , light-green Packard car that he used to earn a good livelihood . He would load six or seven tourists into the Packard and drive them all over the place showing them the sights of Havana . Back then , baseball and boxing were the top sports in Cuba . My dad used to listen to New York Yankee games on the radio ; his favorite players were Babe Ruth and , later , Roger Maris and Joe DiMaggio . But my father was not much of a baseball player himself . He shagged a few balls when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father met my mother , Barbara , when they were both teenagers in Regla . He had come back from Louisiana and was studying at the Institute of Havana , from which he graduated with a degree in English . They used to go ballroom dancing or take strolls together around the town 's central park . Sometimes they would go to the movies to catch the latest Errol Flynn picture or sweeping sagas like Gone With the Wind . // My parents and older sister , Teresa , were living in Regla in July 1964 when my mother gave birth to me and my twin brother , Osvaldo . People like to say that Ozzie and I were like pocket-sized atom bombs when we were babies , but my father says we were actually nice and quiet . People were always fussing over us . They usually had trouble telling the two of us apart because we looked the same and were the exact same size and weight . But I had a birthmark on the back of my hand , so that helped family members know which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be living in Cuba , especially since the government knew my father did not support their system . My father had to wait until the year after Ozzie and I were born for a chance to leave . The Castro government announced in 1965 that it would allow an airlift of people from Varadero , Cuba , to Miami . Ozzie and I were just babies when my parents took us and Teresa to the airport , where we climbed into a small propeller plane . There was only room for about twenty people inside , and apparently it was stuffy . I do n't remember any of that , but it was an important day for the family and we heard about it later . // " It was very , very hot inside the plane , " my father used to tell us , looking back on that momentous day . // He would always tell us how sad he was , leaving behind his home country and his parents , and the rest of his family .

My Aunt Lilia was there at the airport , waiting to meet us , but first my parents had to go through an inspection . They had no money or identification , but they stripped my father and searched him , and then stripped my mother and searched her , too . // " We had nothing , " my father would tell us. // But he had English , and the work experience to land a good job soon after he arrived in America . He found work as a territory manager for Amoco Oil , which was a good position , but to him it was only a start , and he was always looking for other ways to bring in extra income ... //
