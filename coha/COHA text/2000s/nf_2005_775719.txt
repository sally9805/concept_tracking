Fifteen of us climbed aboard the ancient white school bus . Wire mesh // covered its windows and four black words ran along its sides : UNITED // STATES MARINE CORPS. // Dressed casually in shorts and sandals , we spread out and sat // alone with our bags . Some sipped coffee from paper cups , and a few unfolded // newspapers they had brought . I found a seat near the back as the bus // started with a roar and a cloud of smoke blew through the open windows . // A second lieutenant , looking crisp in his gabardine and khaki // uniform , sat in the front row . He had just graduated from Officer Candidates // School , and would escort us on the hour 's drive to the Marine Corps base in // Quantico , Virginia . Shortly after we pulled away from the recruiting office , he // stood in the aisle and turned to face us . I expected a welcome , a joke , some // commiseration. // " Honor , courage , and commitment are the Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine . He sounded scripted , but also // sincere . " If you ca n't be honest at OCS , how can the Corps trust you to lead // men in combat ? " // Combat . I glanced around the bus 's gunmetal interior , surprised to // see people reading or pretending to sleep . No one answered the lieutenant 's // question . He stood there in the aisle , glaring at us , and I sat up a little // straighter . The lieutenant was my age , but he looked different . Shorter hair , of // course , and broader shoulders . It was more than that . He had an edge , // something in his jaw or his brow that made me self-conscious . // I turned toward the window to avoid his gaze . Families drove next // to us , on their way to the lake or the beach . Kids wearing headphones // gawked , surely wondering what losers were riding a school bus in the // summertime . A girl in an open Jeep stood and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a laughing friend . They waved and // accelerated past . I thought of my friends , spending their summer vacations in // New York and San Francisco , working in air-conditioned office towers and // partying at night . Staring through the wire mesh at the bright day , I thought // this must be what it 's like on the ride to Sing Sing . I wondered why I was on // that bus . // I went to Dartmouth intending to go to med school . Failing a chemistry class // had inspired my love of history , and I ended up majoring in the classics . By // the summer of 1998 , my classmates were signing six-figure contracts as // consultants and investment bankers . I did n't understand what we , at age // twenty-two , could possibly be consulted about . Others headed off to law // school or medical school for a few more years of reading instead of living . // None of it appealed to me . I wanted to go on a great adventure , to prove // myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something so hard that no one // could ever talk shit to me . In Athens or Sparta , my decision would have been // easy . I felt as if I had been born too late . There was no longer a place in the // world for a young man who wanted to wear armor and slay dragons . // Dartmouth encouraged deviation from the trampled path , but only // to join organizations like the Peace Corps or Teach for America . I wanted // something more transformative . Something that might kill me  --  or leave me // better , stronger , more capable . I wanted to be a warrior . // My family had only a short martial tradition . My maternal // grandfather , like many in his generation , had served in World War II . He was // a Navy officer in the South Pacific , and his ship , the escort carrier Natoma // Bay , fought at New Guinea , Leyte Gulf , Iwo Jima , and Okinawa , often // supporting Marine invasion forces ashore . At 0635 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , only two months before the end of the war , a Japanese // kamikaze crashed into the Natoma Bay 's flight deck . The explosion tore a // hole in the steel twelve feet wide and twenty feet long . Shrapnel peppered my // grandfather 's body . My mother remembers watching him pick pieces of metal // from his skin twenty years later . He had some of that shrapnel melted into a // lucky horseshoe , which was shown to me with great reverence when I was a // child . // My father enlisted in the Army in 1968 . When most of his basic // training class went to Vietnam , he received orders to the Army Security // Agency . He spent a year in Bad Aibling , Germany , eavesdropping on Eastern // bloc radio transmissions and waiting for the Soviets to roll through the Fulda // Gap . He completed OCS just as President Richard Nixon began drawing // down the military , and took advantage of an early out to go to law school . But // my dad was proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a letter during my junior year at Dartmouth , // promising to pay for graduate school . The Navy and Air Force did the same , // promising skills and special training . The Marine Corps promised nothing . // Whereas the other services listed their benefits , the Corps asked , " Do you // have what it takes ? " If I was going to serve in the military , I would be a Marine . // A few months before , I 'd seen a poster in the dining hall // advertising a talk by Tom Ricks . Then the Wall Street Journal 's Pentagon // correspondent , Ricks had recently written a book about the Marines . I sat up // most of one night reading it . I arrived early to get a good seat and listened as // Ricks explained the Corps 's culture and the state of civil-military relations in // the United States . His review of the Marines , or at least my interpretation of // it , was glowing . The Marine Corps was a last bastion of honor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a team , to trust one // another and themselves , and to sacrifice for a principle . Hearing it from a // recruiter , I would have been skeptical . But here was a journalist , an impartial // observer . // The crowd was the usual mix of students , faculty , and retired // alumni . After the talk , a young professor stood . " How can you support the // presence of ROTC at a place like Dartmouth ? " she asked . " It will militarize // the campus and threaten our culture of tolerance . " // " Wrong , " replied Ricks . " It will liberalize the military . " He explained // that in a democracy , the military should be representative of the people . It // should reflect the best of American society , not stand apart from it . // Ricks used words such as " duty " and " honor " without cynicism , // something I 'd not often heard at Dartmouth . // His answer clinched my decision to apply for a slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and senior years of college . I // would have laughed at the idea of joining the Corps on a bet or because of a // movie , but my own choice was almost equally capricious . Although I had // reached the decision largely on my own , Tom Ricks , in an hour-long talk on a // cold night at Dartmouth , finally convinced me to be a Marine . // But even joining the Marines did n't seem as crazy as it had to my // parents ' generation . This was 1998 , not 1968 . The United States was // cashing in its post-cold war peace dividend . Scholars talked about " the end // of history , " free markets spreading prosperity throughout the world , and the // death of ideology . I would be joining a peacetime military . At least that 's the // rationale I used when I broke the news to my parents . They were surprised // but supportive . " The Marines , " my dad said , " will teach you everything I love // you too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base in Quantico straddles Interstate 95 , sprawling across // thousands of acres of pine forest and swamp thirty miles south of // Washington . Our bus rumbled through the gate , and we drove past rows of // peeling warehouses and brick buildings identified only by numbered signs . // They looked like the remnants of some dead industry , like the boarded-up // mills on the riverbanks of a New Hampshire town . // " Christ , man , where 're the ovens ? This place looks like Dachau. " // Only a few forced laughs met this quip from someone near the back of the // bus . // We drove farther and farther onto the base  --  along the edge of a // swamp , through miles of trees , far enough to feel as if they could kill us here // and no one would ever know . That , of course , was the desired effect . // When the air brakes finally hissed and the door swung open , we // sat in the middle of a blacktop parade deck the size of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sign at the blacktop 's // edge read UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS OFFICER CANDIDATES // SCHOOL  --  DUCTUS EXEMPLO . I recognized the motto from Latin // class : " Leadership by Example . " // I hoped a drill instructor in a Smokey Bear hat would storm onto // the bus and order us off to stand on yellow footprints . Pop culture has // immortalized the arrival of enlistedMarine recruits at Parris Island , South // Carolina . But this was OCS , and the lack of theatrics disappointed me. // A fresh-faced Marine with a clipboard took the roll by Social // Security number and then handed a pencil to each of us , saying we had a lot // of paperwork to fill out . // For two days , we shuffled from line to line for haircuts , gear issue , // and a battery of physical tests . Candidates who had returned after being // dropped from previous OCS classes explained this routine : the schedule was // designed to minimize the number of us who flunked out for high blood // pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer // would fall . // We slept in squad bays with fifty bunks per room . There , on the // evenings before OCS really started , I got my first lesson in esprit de corps. // OCS is competitive . Since the peacetime Marine Corps needs a fixed // number of officers , a certain number of candidates are earmarked to graduate // while the rest are destined to fail . I thought this put us in competition with // one another , but the candidates who had been dropped before , or who had // served as enlisted Marines , shared their knowledge with the rest of us. // The Corps is a naval service , with nautical vocabulary . Doors are // hatches , walls are bulkheads , and floors are decks . Signs at Quantico , miles // from the sea , read WELCOME ABOARD . They also taught us the more // arcane language of the Marines . Running shoes were called go-fasters . Our // flashlights , worn on the hip at OCS , were moonbeams . When we looked // confused , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to // the Fleet , he told us . Three different pieces of equipment were known as // a " donkey dick "  --  a radio antenna , a brush for cleaning mortar tubes , and a // funnel for fueling Humvees. // In the beginning , my strongest impression of Quantico , apart from // its isolation , was its timelessness . Looking around the squad bay , I could // imagine Franklin Roosevelt in the White House . No plastic , no advertising , no // bright colors . Just two-high metal racks , as our bunks were called , a green // linoleum floor , brick walls , and bare bulbs overhead . The only decoration was // a sign of two-foot-high letters stenciled along an entire wall : HONOR , // COURAGE , COMMITMENT . I already had the feeling that the Marines were a // world apart , that what we did at OCS would be separate from the rest of my // life . // When another candidate dragged a wooden footlocker next to // mine and sat down , I was glad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stuck out his hand . // Dave was a football player at William and Mary . His brother had // gone to Dartmouth . His easy smile made me like him right away . // " So what do you think ? " I tried to ask the question with less // trepidation than I felt . // Dave smiled and said , " I think we 're in for a shitty summer . But // I 've wanted to be a Marine since I was a kid . What 's that saying ? ' Pain is // temporary . Pride is forever . ' " // " I saw a bumper sticker in the parking lot that said ' Nobody ever // drowned in sweat . ' " I was nervous . Not scared or intimidated  --  that would // come later  --  but apprehensive . The Marine transformation is one of // American life 's storied tests . I knew its reputation was earned . // We had the barest taste of it at the supply warehouse on the // morning of the ominous third day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bin , selecting green camouflage blouses and trousers , nylon belts with // two olive-drab canteens attached , and odd items such as bug spray // labeled " Repellent , Arthropod . " Two young Marines in the warehouse took // advantage of the chance to hassle a group of future officers . // " Get at parade rest ! " // It was an alien command . I clasped my hands in front of me and // tried to look respectful . // " You gon na gaff us off ? Get at the position of attention . " // The candidates around me stood a little straighter , with their // hands at their sides . The two Marines told us there were only two ways to // stand at OCS : parade rest  --  feet shoulder-width apart , hands clasped in the // small of the back , eyes straight ahead ; and at attention  --  heels together , // back straight , hands at your sides with thumbs along the trouser seams . // Later , we assembled for lunch in a Word War II-era Quonset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we munched processed meat // sandwiches and apples  --  a prepared lunch the Marines called a " boxed // nasty "  --  as the school 's commanding officer ( CO ) outlined his expectations // of us . The colonel 's lantern jaw , craggy nose , and graying hair were straight // from a recruiting commercial . He looked as if he could wrestle any of us to // the floor , and authority ran deep in his voice . // " We seek to identify in each candidate those qualities of intellect , // human understanding , and moral character that enable a person to inspire // and to control a group of people successfully : leaders , " he said . " A // candidate 's presence under pressure is a key indicator of leadership // potential . In trying to identify Marine leaders who may someday face combat , // we want to see who can think and function under stress . Stress at OCS is // created in many ways , as you will see . " // When the colonel concluded , he called forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All had served as drill instructors . At OCS , though , // they were called " sergeant instructors , " and we would address them by that // title , their rank , and their name . The staff marched smartly down the aisle // and stood at attention before us . Khaki uniforms with splashes of colored // ribbons , eyes focused over our heads on the back wall of the room , no // smiles . They were sergeants , staff sergeants , and gunnery sergeants , mostly // men with ten to twenty years in the Corps . I saw scars and biceps and // tattoos . With introductions complete , the colonel turned to the staff and // uttered ten words that ended our civilian lives : " Take charge and carry out the // plan of the day . " // Tables turned over , chairs clattered to the floor , and I forgot all // about the half-eaten apple in my hand . The staff charged us . We ran out the // back door of the Quonset hut . I wanted to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way out to the highway , and hitchhike home . But pride // trumps most other impulses in young men , and I fell into a ragged formation // with my new platoon-mates. // " Stop eyeballing the freakin ' area , maggot . " My eyes were locked // to the front . I did n't think he was talking to me . Warm , wet breath on my // cheeks . If not me , then someone right next to me. // " Lock your body ! " // Spittle across my eyes and lips . The Marine strutted up and down // our crooked ranks . He spoke to the group , but in a way that made it personal // for each of us. // " If you so much as breathe , I 'll hear it and rip your freakin ' // windpipe out . Now grab your freakin ' trash and move with purpose . Pretend // for me that you want to be here . " // We shouldered our bags . Candidates with foresight had brought // hiking packs . They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalachian Trail . The truly lost labored with their leather brief bags and // suitcases . I fell somewhere in between , striving mightily to be inconspicuous // with an oversize duffel bag . // I snuck a look at the instructor 's nametag . Olds . Three stripes on // his shoulder . Sergeant Olds . He was yelling , veins popping , eyes bulging . // His arms waved from broad shoulders that tapered to his waist with all the // menacing grace of a wasp . I looked at Sergeant Instructor Sergeant Olds , // sensing he had just become a fixture in my life . // " Do n't eyeball me , candidate . Do you want to ask me out on a // date ? You look like you want to ask me out . " // " No , Sergeant Instructor Sergeant Olds . " // " Go ahead , candidate . Keep whispering . And keep looking deep // into my eyes . " His voice dropped to a whisper , and he moved in close . I // watched a vein throbbing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I dare you to ask me out . Your chucklehead classmates here might // get a laugh out of it , but I swear it 'll be the last thing you ever do . " // This is theater , right ? I had seen Full Metal Jacket . It 's all a joke . // But it did n't feel like a joke . When Olds spoke to me , icy adrenaline washed // through my chest . My legs shook . The worst part was that Olds knew he 'd // gotten to me . He would , I feared , increase the pressure . // For now , Olds pivoted on a spit-shined heel and struck out across // the parade deck . Lacking better options , we followed him . Large raindrops // splotched the dark asphalt . The splotches grew bigger and closer together // until they finally merged into a single , dark stain . I dragged my duffel bag // along the pavement , struggling to keep its strap from biting into my shoulder . // The bag had felt lighter when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed only // the required list : three sets of civilian clothes , running shoes , a toiletry kit , // and the combat boots mailed weeks before so I could break them in . I folded // the clothes crisply , careful to crease each trouser leg and keep the shirt // fronts smooth . // Sergeant Olds had opened a gap of fifty yards between himself // and the straggling platoon . He stood facing us with his hands on his // hips . " Dump your trash . I want to see who 's trying to sneak naked pictures of // his boyfriend into my squad bay . " // I hesitated , unsure whether he actually meant for us to dump our // belongings onto the puddled pavement . Steam rose as the rain hit the ground . // " What are we , deaf ? I said dump your trash . Do it now . Move ! " // I unzipped my bag and placed the boots on the blacktop . Then I // stacked my clothes on them and put the toiletry bag on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my carefully constructed pile . He kicked it // over and put a boot print on the chest of my neatly ironed shirt . // " What 's in here ? " He grabbed my toiletry bag . " Drugs ? Booze ? // Maybe a tube of K-Y jelly and a big cucumber ? " // One by one , my toothbrush , toothpaste , razor , and shaving cream // fell to the ground . // " You must have hidden it pretty well , candidate , " Olds // growled . " But I 'll find it . Oh , yeah , I 'll find it . And when I do , I 'll run your ass // out of my Marine Corps before you can even call your congressman . " // Olds moved on to his next victim , and I hesitantly began to piece // my life back together , wondering again why I was at OCS .
