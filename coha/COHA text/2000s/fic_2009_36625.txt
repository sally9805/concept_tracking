December 12 , 2005 <br> <p> Last night Leon dangled the carrot of a fancy literary award before my greedy snout and I , like the pig I am , lurched for it . <p> Arrived on time for the Humphrey , freshly shaved , in suit and tie , and joined the throng of hipster literati milling outside the ballroom . I was shown to a table near the back of the room . Not a good sign . An aging socialite stinking of chardonnay and Chanel No. 5 leaned in , " Are you a writer ? I hope someone at this table is a writer ! " I beamed as if we were sharing a witty joke . A salad adorned with flower petals was put in front of me . Wine was poured . <p> I spied Leon seated three tables closer to the front of the room . He waved . I nodded . He turned away . My own editor could not be bothered to come over to my table and say hello . Of course , Leon wanted me there because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No budget means there will be no display ads . No audio book . No parties given in my honor at Balthazar or the Four Seasons . All I will get is an abbreviated book tour ( flying coach and residing at budget hotels ) . No NPR appearances . No magazine covers . If I 'm lucky , I 'll get two or three guest lecture gigs at second-rate colleges . It 's all nickels and dimes to him . <p> At my table for eight , the chocolate mousse lay unforked and the decaf cooled as the jovial movie stars onstage speculated on the names of the winners present in the crowd ( forgetting to mention me , of course ) . An honorary award was given out to a publisher of progressive children 's books . A eulogy was intoned for the CEO of a major media corporation who had died rock climbing a week earlier . And so the circus dragged on and on . Finally , a winner was announced . <p> Upon hearing a name , not my name , my neighbors dropped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads turned to gauge my humiliation . An obese publicist to my right patted my hand in consolation . " I 'm sure your book was much better , Richard . " His pupils dilated with the thrill of witnessing my pain . <p> The winner , a tweedy , aging Ivy Leaguer , florid-faced and wet-eyed ( due to the quarts of vintage wine he has consumed daily since his first literary bestseller ) jogged up to the podium . The lickspittles leapt to their feet and applauded . With his usual tennis club jocularity he snatched the prize from Catherine Zeta-Jones , took her in his arms and kissed her on the mouth . I shivered with disgust . <p> The victor leaned into the microphone , thanked his wife , his agent , his housemaid and , of course , Leon , who digested this morsel with beatific sliteyed joy . I could only think , do n't thank me , motherfucker . Your writing is vapid and ironic to no purpose . It is a wretched blend of overwrought creative writing school frosting . It is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucker in the peanut gallery . I could never write what you write my friend . I do n't " do " sentimentality and I do n't do glib . I do n't do clichT . <p> BUT WAIT , what the fuck had I been smoking ? I forgot our hero 's spot on the bestseller lists ! I overlooked the most important aspect of this enterprise , that we 're all in it to get RICH ! Of course ! The true measure of the artist . Does your stuff SELL ? Why would anyone be doing this , making all this effort , if not to sell millions of " units " so that the authorhero can become a wealthy author-hero ! Then the author-hero can attend more dinners and receive more awards and sell more movie options to the corporate leviathans , and spend more time at more Hamptons get-togethers to cluck and kiss the other author-heros ' bronzed cheeks , dazzled by the reflection of the collective genius present . The artist is the antenna of the race and the race is venal and shallow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black T-shirts and slacks , Secret Service earbuds wired to their skulls , herded the crowd toward the exit . The literati scrabbled like fiddler crabs , snatching their swag bags packed with glossy consumer magazines , CDs and bad perfume , pinching and clawing , then scuttling off to flag a cab . I was aiming for an exit when one old fool sneezed on me ! For a moment , I wanted to beat his face in , but then ... <p> Success has its price . But it also has its rewards . And here she was , my compensation for enduring this trial . Brown-eyed , smooth-skinned , scented like the spring flower she was . She smiled shyly at me and said , " Richard Morris ! I ca n't believe it ! I ... I ... " She actually stuttered as she pretended to be awed . This goddess wore designer glasses , signifying erudition . Her hair was smooth and perfectly cut , her face unblemished . Her fragrance was like wine before the first sip . Before I said a word she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wonderful ! The judges have their heads up their asses ! " <p> Out of the corner of my eye I spied Leon laughing it up with the winner . I turned my back on them and ingested the lovely praise . When my new friend was a student at Amherst or Princeton or wherever , she wrote her thesis on my first novel , blah-blah-blah . But wait , there was more ! With cocksure vigor she launched into a debate of magical realism ( she had read my pointed essay in The New York Review of Books last year ) and announced " You 're full of shit " ! She argued her case with a verbatim quote ! Nothing in the world is more erotic than a beautiful stranger uttering one 's exact words . I fell into her eyes , the pact was sealed . <p> I had a car and driver for the evening so I offered her a ride home on my way to my own uptown pied-a-terre where I would be staying the night . As we maneuvered the traffic , she chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I focused on the aquarium world drifting beyond the tinted windows where people strolled , lapped ice cream cones , hailed cabs , entered and exited buildings . Each individual represented a single priority , living from moment to moment , fleeing or pursuing , praying or narcotizing . <p> In a deep reverie by the time we stopped outside my building , I discovered that my acolyte had decided she did n't want to go home just yet . I understood . She was curious , eager to see my unique two thousand square feet of living space . She had an urge to visit my library , my art collection , my media center , my kitchen . My shower cabinet . <p> Earlier in the evening , I had dimmed the lights and thrown open the drapes , anticipating a guest . I never do this for Sarah but upon reentering the apartment , I thought of her . It was her fault she was being replaced this evening . She could n't join me tonight and I was forced to go stag . Her loss . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie set : vistas , twinkly lights out there in the black , the rising moon . I flipped on the stereo and poured brandies . Everything proceeded per usual . <p> She was a writer , of course . And marginally interesting because twenty years ago when she was eight years old , her father accidentally shot her mother in the leg , severing the femoral artery . This brilliant young woman , then a brilliant little girl , witnessed her mother 's death as she bled out on the living room floor . I brought up my own mother 's premature death and we discussed that for a while until I sensed that tears were imminent and I changed the subject . After endless all-night sessions with various ex-girlfriends and lovers , I am no longer available as therapist to fucked-up beauties . I want my perquisites with no strings attached . <p> The awards dinner was a fading memory as we flirted . It was fait accompli , was n't it ? We were striking a deal . She would permit me to caress those mysterious thighs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would grant her access to the inner sanctum of a great man 's life . She would be allowed to entertain the illusion that she had melded with a great mind . ( A mind not unlike hers , of course . ) This entitlement would nourish her grandiosity , which she mistook for authentic talent . <p> My venerable cum was still cooling ( or warming ? ) in her somewhere when I began to get restless . ( No , no condom . I 'm fixed . Furthermore I always make a pretense of being a person who rarely gets laid , ergo , the logic is , I carry no STDs . Girls like my new friend are usually clean and so am I. I hope . ) <p> At two a.m , I let her know I had an early morning appointment and invited her to depart . She seemed surprised by this . As she redressed , I killed time scanning the latest issue of The New York Review of Books , then escorted her down to my driver , who had been waiting patiently under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar about that . <p> I handed her an autographed copy of A Gentle Death , slammed the door of the car , blew a kiss , turned on my heels and marched smartly back into the mild glow of the lobby , where my stoic doorman kept vigil . His face betrayed nothing . <p> In the elevator I discovered myself in a mirror . I am in my mid-fifties , almost handsome , gray-haired , bespectacled . I have the bearing of what ? A successful man of the city . Or just one more putz ? I am a Jew , an " Eastern intellectual "  --  the kind of man the conservatives hate . Unlike my numerous uncles , I am neither overweight nor short . Like them , I wear the mask of one who is both focused and bemused , benign and angry . A wry smile and a furrowed brow lend an enigmatic quality . Here I am , as the world sees me , as I see me . No matter what I do , I ca n't get past myself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment after a date . It was as if I 'd been holding my breath for hours and could finally exhale . All the disturbances had been cleared away , life was calm once more . The storm had passed , the rain had fallen and the sun was peeking out . I washed down a tab of Ambien with a mouthful of Fiji water and hit the sack . <p> I must have been asleep for twenty minutes when the phone rang . For a moment I had no idea where I was , or even who I was . Total disorientation . My companion 's scent garnished the sheets . The early morning gloom of my bedroom was deep and soporific . I swam back to wakefulness and reached for the phone thinking that the call must be from the young lady . She 'd probably left something behind . Wanted to come by in the morning to pick it up . That old trick . <p> Ready for a fight , I picked up the phone . But the voice on the other end was unexpectedly male . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that my father was speaking . I tripped through a list of potential emergencies including a car accident , a brain aneurysm , even death . That he could call me after dying of a heart attack did not at that moment seem illogical . I groped for a light switch and the room exploded , yoking a band of pain around my skull . Only at that point did I realize I 'd spent most of the previous evening drunk . <p> My father was neither dead nor ill , not in any trouble at all . He was calling because his aged aunt Sadie ( my great-aunt ) had died . She had resisted to the end . He described a gruesome final few hours , in which she had to struggle for every breath . Things had resolved as they do . Ninety-six years old and Sadie was at peace at last . <p> I assured him I would drive up in the morning . I had planned to use the day to lay out the bones of an essay for the Times op-ed page , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sans expense . But I did n't want to write it in the first place ( " Literacy and the Internet " ) and now I had an excuse to postpone it . In the world of contemporary publishing , there are two emergencies that are never questioned : a death in the family and a request to fly out to Hollywood to " take a meeting . " The Times would wait . <p> Copyright 2009 by Ararat Productions , Inc . <br> Continues ...
