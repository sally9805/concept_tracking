<p> Lobster boats begin pulling up to the docks of the Atwood Lobster Company around 11 a.m . All afternoon they trickle in , unload crate after heavy crate of wriggling crustaceans , and retire for the day . On a good day , perhaps 5,000 lobsters pass through this lobster pound in Spruce Head , Maine . Lobster catches in New England have rarely looked so good : Over the past 30 years , lobster landings have increased steadily , hitting a record high of 73 million pounds in 1997 . Even as the numbers rise , however , scientists predict that the lobster population is headed for a crash . Last year , they declared the American lobster an overfished species . Not surprisingly , the fishermen disagree . " I do n't think scientists know all that much about lobsters . They just think they do , " says Colin Grierson , a Maine fisherman who has been trapping lobsters for 20 years . " Right now , I do n't believe they have any idea what 's going on . " Mike Flannigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shares the sentiment . " They know nothing about this resource , " he says of the fisheries scientists . " They 've been talking about a decline in the lobster fisheries since I started 45 years ago . " This distrust of scientists is not uncommon in the fisheries industry , perhaps with good cause . Much of the time , it is the scientists ' data that lawmakers use to place limitations on how many people fish , how many fish a person catches , how those fish are caught , and how large they must be . It 's the scientists who help determine whether a fisherman will thrive or fail , many fishermen say . " Science has always been used by federal and state administrators as a bludgeon to try to get fishermen to agree to limited entry or trap limits , " says Jim Wilson , professor of fisheries economics and policy at the University of Maine , Orono . " Fishermen have had a very antagonistic relationship with scientists as a result . " Dr. Wilson heads a movement that is helping breech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working with the state 's Department of Marine Resources , he helped establish a " co-management " program in the lobster fishery . Scientists and legislators divided Maine into seven zones , based on geographical and cultural differences such as whether the ocean floor is sandy or rocky and what kind of traps are used . Within each zone , the lobstermen themselves are now responsible for making the same decisions that once were handed down from on high - from how many traps each fisherman is allowed to put in the water to how many fishing licenses are issued ( known as limited entry ) . This , Wilson says , is beginning to change the fisher-scientist relationship . " When they can limit trap and entry themselves , they 're now starting to ask questions about the scientific side of doing that : How far do we go ? How much do we allow ? " Their industry has always been local - each person fishes the same waters year after year - and as a result Maine lobstermen have evolved methods of protecting their resource . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cut a small notch in the tail of any egg-laden female they catch and throw her back into the water . Because the notch remains until she molts and because the laws require fishermen to throw back any v-notched females , this helps maintain a healthy breeding population . While they have always been protective of their fishery , they have not always understood why the scientific data is important and how it can be used . Now , however , " fishermen are starting to see that science may be beneficial and can help them in their decision making , " says Carl Wilson , the chief lobster biologist for the state of Maine and Jim Wilson 's son . Ironically , now that they have a use for the data , they are discovering that there is not always enough scientific data to help them make these decisions . According to Pat White , the executive director of the Maine Lobsterman 's Association , scientists recently finished an in-depth lobster-stock assessment , and the results are worse than any stock assessment in history . " They 're worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what we do n't know is more than what we do know . " " We do n't know the lobsters ' migratory pattern ; we do n't know what has caused the rise and fall in landings , so we ca n't better manage the resource , " Mr. White says . Part of the reason that scientists know so little about the lobster is because marine species are difficult to study . Researching bottom-dwelling species requires boats , nets , diving equipment , and large amounts of time to gather small amounts of data . So instead , scientists began asking fishermen if they could accompany them for a day to get a better feel for how many lobsters were out there . Initially , most fishermen gave them the cold shoulder . But when they were put in charge of their own resource , the lobstermen began to realize that the data the scientists produced did not match their own . " They understand that what they see every day is n't being accounted for in the science , " Carl Wilson says . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you on the boat because you 're just going to shut us down . ' But in reality , fishermen want to know if they 're going to have a living next year as much as managers want to make sure that there 's a resource . " This has helped the scientists , too , he says . " It 's made me much less of a bad guy , and those guys much more of a research base . " As a result of talking with the marine fisheries scientists , fishermen have become more aware of how to conserve their resource . Moving in the direction of conservation was in their interest , says Jim Wilson . " If we can arrange situations in which they 're being greedy and the result is conservation , what a great outcome . " The question many ask now is whether this conservation-based approach would work outside the lobster industry . It looks promising . So far , scientists in Maine are collaborating with fishermen in the herring and scallop industries as well . " It is hard to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf of Maine Aquarium Development Corporation and one of the scientists collaborating in the herring fishery . " It is hard to run a fishing vessel well . Hard to run a research vessel well . Then , in addition , to figure out how to be successful collaborating together when the two cultures are very , very different . " It 's not impossible , " he says . " Even with the best-intended fishermen and scientists , it takes effort and patience because the two groups talk a different language , they face different realities . " " And yet , " Dr. Perkins says , " there 's been a major increase in interest between them . " Maine 's comanagement program is still far from perfect , according to managers and scientists involved in the transition . Many lobstermen - especially those who have been fishing these waters for decades - have never been to a zone meeting , have never taken advantage of the " one man , one vote " system , and do not believe that anything has changed . The younger lobstermen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The zone councils are receptive to what we want , " says Casey Morrill , who has been fishing for seven years . Mr. Morrill has taken scientists out on his boat many times and says he has learned a lot , including the importance of v-notching and of moving the location of his traps to avoid exhausting stock in one location . Success appears to come one fisherman at a time . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
