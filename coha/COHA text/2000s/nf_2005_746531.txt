In his best selling book , The World is Flat , Thomas Friedman describes the interconnected global economy enabled by advances in information and communications technology and other factors that he terms " flatteners. " ( n1 ) This compelling tale does not , however , include a description of the 60-year , post-Second World War evolution in sea trade that has made globalization possible . As stated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , " the world paradigm for global prosperity has been predicated on near-frictionless transport and trade . " ( n2 ) Although efficient sea trade is a critical component of the world economy , security was not a significant factor in the design or evolution of the global trading system . The attacks of 11 September 2001 made it apparent that revolutionary changes in maritime and port security would be required . This paper outlines the threats against and vulnerabilities of the sea-trade system ; describes the international and U.S. response ; discusses gaps that have not been adequately addressed and issues that are not yet resolved ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on others to retro-fit security into the complex systems that are the basis of world economic well-being . <p> Sea trade today bears little resemblance to the postwar trade dominated by U.S. and European general-purpose fleets . A relentless drive to efficiency resulted in the segmentation of maritime trade , ships and port facilities into highly specialized subsystems. ( n3 ) Ports have adapted to this segregation of trade by creating uniquely designed facilities for each type of cargo , and the general purpose terminals that marked the waterfronts of all U.S. port cities became restaurants , condominiums and shops . High-value cargo is shipped in containers , and container ships are loaded and unloaded in container facilities designed to efficiently transfer these boxes to other modes of transportation . Next to the invention of the microchip , the most significant step toward a global economy occurred when Malcolm McLean , the trucking entrepreneur , bought a steamship company in 1955 and introduced the concept of shipping cargo-laden truck trailers. ( n4 ) The first Sealand container vessel , Ideal-X , carried only 58 containers on deck and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it changed sea trade forever . McLean could not have envisioned that , by 2005 , " if all the containers in the world were lined up , it would create a container wall of 108,000 kilometers , or 2.7 times the circumference of the world . " ( n5 ) The trend toward specialization of ships and port facilities did not stop with containerization . Automobiles are shipped on specially designed vehicle carriers and landed at vehicle handling facilities . Petroleum and chemical products are shipped on tankers through liquid bulk facilities . Liquid Natural Gas ( LNG ) and Liquid Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) ships and facilities are designed to safely and efficiently move their particular cargo . Cruise ships have evolved and specialized as have cruise ship terminals . Bulk-cargo carriers transport critical commodities ( grain , ores , fertilizers , etc. ) through bulk terminals . As a consequence of this segmentation of sea trade , a major port should be viewed as a loosely coupled collection of highly efficient subsystems . <p> The focus on efficiency has , in addition to specialization , resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facility types ( e.g. , super tankers carrying more than 300,000 tons of oil , container ships with a capacity of more than 10,000 twenty-foot equivalent ( TEU ) containers , mega-passenger ships carrying 5,000 passengers ) . It has also resulted in a geographically vulnerable concentration of key ship ping trades . The port of Los Angeles/Long Beach transships 42 percent of all container traffic in the United States ; the ports of Houston and the lower Mississippi River receive more than 50 percent of our oil imports . The bulk-cargo facilities of the lower Mississippi handle more than 60 percent of U.S. agricultural exports from the Midwest . Critical nodes also exist internationally ; almost 50 percent of all containers imported into the United States are shipped from 10 ports . A majority of world trade passes through one or more of the constrained waters of the world ( e.g. , Strait of Gibraltar , Panama Canal , Suez Canal , Strait of Hormuz , Straits of Malacca , Horn of Africa , Bosporus , Cape of Good Hope , Cape Horn/Strait of Magellan ) . <p> International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization ( IMO ) and U.S. Coast Guard respectively , as well as insurers , classification societies , owners and operators historically addressed safety issues in the evolving system through conventions , laws , regulations and inspection/certification practices . When security was considered , the primary focus was on reducing losses through theft and defense against piracy. ( n6 ) Criminal attacks and the use of the international trade system for illegal commerce have been significant problems . The system is used for smuggling contraband and is vulnerable to theft of legitimate cargo , or " shrinkage " ( $30-$50 million per year ) , and piracy. ( n7 ) Vessels have also been terrorist targets : The cruise ship Achile Lauro was hijacked on 17 October 1985 ; the USS Cole was attacked in Aden , Yemen on 12 October 2000 ; the French tanker Limburg was attacked on 4 October 2002 off the coast of Yemen ; and Katyusha rockets were fired at the USS Ashland in Aqaba , Jordan , on 19 August 2005 . In February 2004 , on the same day that two members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 200 passengers and crew members were killed in a fire aboard the Philippine Superferry 14 caused by the explosion of an incendiary bomb in a television set. ( n8 ) Terrorists have also attempted to infiltrate the global container supply chain . In October 2001 , a potential terrorist was discovered in a container in the Italian port of Gioia Tauro. ( n9 ) <p> It became apparent in the post-9/11 world that the sea-trade system provides potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities that could be exploited by terrorists . Stephen Flynn has been perhaps the most outspoken advocate for identifying and eliminating these vulnerabilities , particularly those relating to the shipping of containers. ( n10 ) The globalization factors that increase trade also increase opportunities for terror . Audrey Kurth Cronin notes that " it would be naive to assume that what is good for international commerce and international communication is not also good for international terrorists  --  who are increasingly becoming opportunistic entrepreneurs whose ' product ' is violence against innocent targets for a political end . " ( n11 ) <p> Reacting to the threat against maritime commerce has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex system composed of multiple economic subsystems . Vulnerabilities in each subsystem must be identified and addressed since an intelligent foe can detect and exploit the weakest link . The international community , prodded by U.S. unilateral actions , is beginning to develop a holistic , systems-oriented approach to security . Significant vulnerabilities remain and the emerging national strategy must not only minimize those vulnerabilities , but also improve the resilience of the system to ensure rapid , effective recovery when an attack does occur . <p> The scenarios are indeed horrifying . Containers , for example , may be used as a vector for an attack involving weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) . A nuclear device smuggled in one of millions of containers and remotely detonated could have catastrophic results . A study conducted by the Department of Transportation 's Volpe Center states that the detonation of a 10-to-20-kiloton weapon in a container would cause a disruption of trade valued at $100-$300 billion , property damage of $50-$500 billion , and the loss of 50,000-1,000,000 lives. ( n12 ) The report states that " global and long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international responses to the nuclear attack , though not calculated , are believed to be substantially greater . " According to Flynn , it would not take a WMD to wreak financial havoc : <p> A dirty bomb smuggled in a container and set off in a seaport would likely kill only a few unfortunate longshoremen and contaminate several acres of valuable waterfront property But if there is no credible security system to restore the public 's confidence that other containers are safe , mayors and governors throughout the country , as well as the President , will come under withering political pressure to order the shutdown of the inter-modal transportation system . Examining cargo in tens of thousands of trucks , trains and ships to ensure it poses no threat would have devastating economic consequences . When containers stop moving , assembly plants go idle , retail shelves are bare , and workers end up in unemployment lines . A three-week shutdown could-well spawn a global recession. ( n13 ) <p> A war-game simulation conducted by Booz Allen Hamilton and the Conference Board was predicated on a dirty bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the impact on the U.S. economy of an emergency closure of ports to inspect containers and the disruption of supply lines resulted in an economic cost of $58 billion. ( n14 ) In the simulation , it took 19 days for U.S. ports to resume normal operations and 92 days to stabilize the container backlog. ( n15 ) <p> Weapon-carrying containers are not the only threat from sea trade . A bulk carrier with a cargo of nitrogen-based fertilizer could recreate the worst industrial disaster in U.S. history the 16 April 1947 Texas City explosion of the vessels Grand camp and High Flyer and the resulting fire that killed 568 people and injured thousands. ( n16 ) More than 400,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer pass through the port of New Orleans each year . An explosion of a bulk carrier containing ammonium nitrate among the tankers , refineries and petrochemical facilities of the lower by sea in 2001 . Mississippi would provide the same lethal mixture of explosive ingredients that destroyed Texas City . Passenger vessels and ferries are mass-transportation assets and potential terrorist targets . A truck bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise ship could cause thousands of casualties . <p> The scale and nature of the maritime system is difficult to appreciate for those not familiar with global commerce . The following statistics provide insight into the complexity of the system that must be made secure : <p> ? 5.8 billion tons of goods were traded by sea in 2001 <p> ? 80 percent of world trade by value , 90 percent by volume , is sea trade <p> ? 4,000 ports ship cargo around the world <p> ? 430 ports possess highly automated container facilities <p> ? 46,000 ships are engaged in international trade , including <p> * 2,700 container vessels-the largest hold more than 5,000 TEU <p> * 23,281 bulk-cargo vessels <p> ? 40,000 freight forwarders are engaged in international trade <p> ? 1,227,000 officers and seamen sail on the vessels in the international merchant fleet <p> ? 400,000 seafarers are from four countries : the Philippines , Indonesia , India and China <p> ? Approximately 12-15 million containers are used in world trade <p> ? 232 million container movements are made through ports worldwide each year <p> ? More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year <p> ? More than 51,000 U.S. port calls are made each year <p> ? Approximately nine million containers enter U.S. ports each year <p> ? All non-North American foreign oil and all Alaskan oil are shipped to the United States via oil tankers <p> ? 318 billion gallons of petroleum products are shipped annually on U.S. waters <p> ? 95 percent by volume of all U.S. non-North American trade is transported by sea <p> ? Six million passengers a year board cruise ships in U.S. ports <p> ? The United States has 95,000 miles of coastline and 361 commercial ports ( n17 ) A Complex-Systems Risk Management Problem <p> The failure to consider potential terrorist threats in the design and evolution of the international trade system means that interventions intended to reduce the likelihood or consequences of terrorist attacks must be added while preserving the operational integrity and efficiency of all subsystems . It is a challenging complex-systems risk management problem . Two useful views of the maritime system are the risk-event chain perspective presented by John Harrald et al . and the functional-layer systems perspective described by Henry Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul Slovic , risk is defined as the likelihood of occurrence of an event and the impacts of the event should it occur. ( n19 ) The likelihood of the event may be decomposed to the likelihood of occurrence of a scenario ( i.e. , threat ) and the likelihood of realization of that scenario ( i.e. , vulnerability ) . Similarly impacts may be separated into immediate consequences of the event and delayed consequences resulting from cascading failures and/or inadequate response . <p> Each of the economic subsystems involved in maritime trade differs significantly in type of ownership , operation , cargo and vessel and port configurations . Subsystems include , but are not limited to : ( 1 ) containerized cargo , ( 2 ) petrochemical cargo , ( 3 ) bulk cargo , ( 4 ) LNG/LPG carriers , ( 5 ) vehicle carriers , ( 6 ) cruise ships , ( 7 ) river/lake and coastal barge traffic and ( 8 ) passenger ferries . Threat , vulnerability and consequences relating to terrorist attacks are unique to each subsystem . In order to illustrate the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the containerized-cargo and bulk-cargo subsystems prior to discussing the countermeasures taken to increase maritime and port security . <p> Figure 1 , adapted from Harrald et al. , shows a risk-event chain for containerized cargo . Containers , for example , provide a method for introducing a weapon of mass destruction into the United States . The owners and operators of container ships are , however , well-known and established companies that operate as members of stable conferences in the liner trade  --  cartels that operate as common carriers on fixed routes and schedules . The container ships and crews themselves are not a threat . The threat comes from the inability to know what is inside the millions of sealed containers . Approximately 2 percent of containers entering the United States were physically opened prior to 9/11 and cargo was often shipped in containers vaguely manifested as " freight of all kinds . " The OECD notes that " a typical door-to-door journey using a shipping container will involve the interaction of approximately 25 different actors , generate 30-40 documents , use two or three different modes , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n20 ) Willis and Ortiz describe how these players interact in the physical-logistics layer of the system , the transaction layer that tracks orders of goods and materials from suppliers to retailers , and an oversight layer that defines and regulates the rules and procedures of the system. ( n21 ) System interventions must address identifying , securing and tracking the contents of millions of containers and preventing a single container with contraband from reaching its intended destination . These interventions must ensure the integrity of the transaction layer of electronic and paper documentation as well as the physical integrity of the logistics layer . <p> As shown in Figure 2 , adapted from Harrald et al. , the trade of low-value commodities in bulk is very different from the trade of high-value containerized goods . Bulk carriers carry commodities based on contracts arranged by brokers and operate in a very open , competitive market environment with very low profit margins . Bulk fleets do not maintain the front-office staffs common to the liner trade . Bulk carriers are registered in flag states with minimum taxes and oversight ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classification societies and manned by low-cost crews . The identity of the owners , operators and cargoes of bulk carriers is difficult to ascertain . This lack of transparency notes the Congressional Research Service , has been a long-standing problem. ( n22 ) The OECD , in a recent report , states that " not only does perfect transparency not exist , but in fact anonymity seems to be the rule rather than the exception , and not only is it permitted , but in many cases positively encouraged . " ( n23 ) William Langewiesche provides an excellent description of how this opaque system has been used to avoid laws , taxes and other responsibilities of ownership. ( n24 ) John Harrald and Kristen Harrald noted in 1991 " that a small , but unacceptable , number of vessels are not maintained in a safe condition and are not operated safely " by owners that deliberately disregarded existing international , national and class standards. ( n25 ) <p> Prior to 9/11 , the problem of dealing with substandard ships was met by the IMO and the U.S. government by increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports . Waiting until a vessel arrives in a U.S. port is not , however , a satisfactory remedy to the terrorist threat . Bulk carriers could come under the influence of , or be owned by , terrorist groups without the knowledge of maritime authorities . The Tamil Tigers are known to operate a fleet of bulk carriers as a source of revenue and as a means of smuggling weapons and other contraband . It is believed that Al Qaeda owns and operates 15-18 bulk carriers. ( n26 ) Threat scenarios involving bulk carriers include the possibility that a ship could be used as a weapon ( e.g. , ramming a bridge or colliding with a passenger vessel ) , as a source of attack ( e.g. , exploding a ship 's cargo in port ) or as a platform to introduce a WMD . Risk interventions for the bulk carrier subsystem must , therefore , include measures to make the system of ownership and operation more transparent , create a trusted shipper program , introduce methods of inspecting cargo prior to arriving in port and increase awareness of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Willis and Ortiz define the following five supply-chain capabilities necessary for the efficient and secure operation of the global container supply chain. ( n27 ) As slightly modified below , they apply to all trade subsystems and provide an appropriate set of goals for the security interventions discussed in the next section : <p> Efficiency . The global supply chain has evolved primarily to deliver goods more quickly and more cheaply than other modes of transport when volume and mass are taken into account and must maintain this level of efficiency <p> Reliability . The system must behave as expected , retrieving and delivering goods as directed-with a minimum amount of loss due to theft and accident . <p> Transparency . The goods that flow through the global supply chain and the vessels and crews that transport them must be legitimately represented to authorities and must be legal for transport and entry . The system should be transparent enough to minimize improper use of the system . <p> Fault Tolerance . The sea-trade system must be able to respond to disruptions and failures of isolated components without bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a problem at a single node or link in the supply chain can bring the entire network to a halt . In fault tolerant systems , the surrounding ports and distribution system can compensate when a section of the system is compromised . <p> Resilience . Resilience is the ability of the supply chain to return to normal operations after a failure of one or more components . ACTIONS TAKEN SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 <p> Although Flynn and others have pointed out that investment in domestic security in general and maritime security in particular is still dwarfed by investment in conventional national security ( i.e. , defense ) and aviation security , significant progress has been made in the four years since 11 September 2001. ( n28 ) International and national actions have created a maritime security framework in this relatively short period of time and have reduced the risk that maritime trade will be used as a pathway for terror . However , significant gaps and unresolved conflicts remain . This section summarizes current and planned initiatives and discusses their intended impact . International Initiatives <p> The most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2002 passage of changes to the Safety of Life at Sea Convention ( SOLAS ) , adding Chapter XI on ship security and creating a new International Ship and Port Security Code ( ISPSC ) . The necessary international basis for a security framework for world sea trade was created for the first time when the provisions of the ISPSC came into effect on 1 July 2004 . The OECD has provided a full discussion of the provisions of the ISPSC. ( n29 ) The OECD breaks down the provisions of SOLAS Chapter XI and the ISPSC into five categories based on the focus of their applicability : <p> ? Measures targeting contracting governments <p> ? Measures targeting ships <p> ? Measures targeting maritime carrier companies <p> ? Measures targeting ports <p> ? Certification and documentation requirements <p> Three important SOLAS Chapter XI provisions address the critical needs of authorities to identify and communicate with ships . The date for requiring automated identification systems ( AIS ) was moved forward to August 2004 , allowing shore-based systems to identify vessels approaching a nation 's maritime domain . SOLAS Chapter XI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unique vessel identification number , allowing for visual identification . Finally , SOLAS will require that all ships carry a ship security alert system ( SSAS ) capable of initiating a security alert to a competent shore-side authority in case of a threat to the security of the vessel . Passenger vessels , chemical tankers , oil tankers , gas carriers and container ships were required to have SSAS by 1 July 2004 . All other ships are not required to comply until 1 July 2006 . <p> The ISPSC requires vessels and ports to conduct security ( i.e. , vulnerability ) assessments , to designate responsible security officers , to develop security plans and to conduct appropriate drills and exercises . Reviewing plans and ensuring compliance are delegated to the flag states for vessels and the port state for ports . The magnitude of completing this task may be inferred from the fact that the ISPSC requirements target individual port facilities rather than ports , and no reliable estimate for the number of port facilities in the world exists. ( n30 ) <p> The International Labor Organization ( ILO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying the world 's 1.2 million seafarers through the Seafarers ' Identity Documents Convention of 2003 , requiring all seafarers to carry an identification document utilizing biometric technology Another major international initiative is the World Customs Organization 's Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade . This framework provides voluntary principles for ensuring the security and validity of the documentation stream and makes importers responsible for verifying the security of their sup ply chain. ( n31 ) The European Commission in its 2002 Ministerial Declaration on Combating Terrorism in Transport agreed that member states would promote a coordinated inter-modal approach to transport security , share best practice and support risk and vulnerability assessments. ( n32 ) Other international organizations actively involved in sea-trade security include the G8 , the European Commission , the World Trade Organization and NATO . U.S. Policy Initiatives <p> The U.S. efforts in sea trade and port security have , as may be expected , greatly exceeded international standards and practice . The U.S. program is a combination of laws , regulations , government programs and public-private partnership programs . The organizational framework for implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DHS ) started operation on 24 January 2003 as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 . The inclusion on 25 February 2003 of the Coast Guard , a unique military law enforcement , regulatory , and operational agency , and the newly created Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) in the new department ensured that the maritime-and port-security threat would not be ignored . The appointment of Adm . James Loy former Coast Guard commandant , first to the position of TSA administrator and then to the position of DHS deputy secretary also facilitated the development of a risk-based maritime strategy . <p> Congress took a significant leadership role in developing the legal framework for managing the threat posed by international sea trade . The American Maritime Transportation Security Act ( MTSA ) was passed in November 2002 . The MTSA and its implementing regulations implement the ISPSC and SOLAS Chapter XI requirements in the United States . The act requires the Coast Guard to develop regional and national maritime transportation security plans and authorizes the Coast Guard to develop security identification cards for port workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 authorize the Customs and Border Patrol to require electronic cargo manifests and other cargo information 24 hours prior to the arrival or departure of cargo from U.S. ports . The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 amends the MTSA and requires the Coast Guard to develop a maritime intelligence system , plans for the Port Security Grant Program and joint operational centers in U.S. ports. ( n33 ) Other relevant legislation includes the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 , which links maritime security to bioterrorism preparedness ; and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004 , which both imposes strict deadlines for complying with the MTSA , thus improving the security of containers , and requires DHS to establish a maritime " watch list . " <p> Developing a comprehensive and consistent national strategy capable of managing the threat , implementing the legislative intent of Congress and integrating maritime security into the homeland security and national security dimensions of maritime security has been a major challenge . In December 2002 , the Coast Guard developed an initial Maritime Strategy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prevent terrorist attacks within , and terrorist exploitation of , the U.S. maritime domain <p> ? Reduce America 's vulnerability to terrorism within the U.S. maritime domain <p> ? Protect U.S. population centers , critical infrastructure , maritime borders , ports , coastal approaches and the boundaries and seams between them <p> ? Protect the U.S. maritime transportation system while preserving the freedom of the U.S. maritime domain for legitimate pursuits <p> ? Minimize the damage and recover from attacks that may occur within the United States maritime domain as either the lead federal agency or as a supporting agency ( n34 ) <p> On 21 December 2004 , recognizing the interaction between homeland security and national security interests in the maritime domain , President Bush signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive 13/National Security Presidential Directive 41 ( HSPD13/NSPD41 ) , which creates an interagency Maritime Security Policy Coordinating Committee and requires a collaborative interagency effort led by the secretaries of homeland security , defense and state to create a National Security Maritime Strategy supported by eight specific implementation plans : <p> ? The National Plan to Achieve Maritime Domain Awareness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the maritime domain and identifying threats as early and as distant from our shores as possible . " <p> ? The International Outreach and Coordination Strategy " provides a frame work to coordinate all maritime security initiatives undertaken with foreign governments and international organizations , and solicits international support for enhanced maritime security , " <p> ? The Maritime Infrastructure Recovery Plan " recommends standardized procedures for the restoration of maritime transportation systems following an incident of national significance . " <p> ? The Maritime Transportation Systems Security Plan " provides strategic recommendations to holistically improve the security of the Marine Transportation System . " <p> ? The Maritime Commerce Security Plan " establishes a comprehensive plan to secure the maritime supply chain . " <p> ? The Domestic Outreach Plan " engages non-federal input to assist with the development and implementation of maritime security policies resulting from NSPD-41/HSPD-13 . " <p> ? The Global Maritime Intelligence Integration Plan " uses existing capabilities to integrate all available intelligence regarding potential threats to U.S. interests in the maritime domain . " <p> ? The Maritime Operational Threat Response Plan " aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its interests in the maritime domain by establishing roles and responsibilities which enable the government to respond quickly and decisively . " ( n35 ) <p> This integrated national effort under the cognizance of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council recognizes both the strategic importance of maritime security issues and the need to involve a wide range of government agencies in addressing strategic response to these issues . A task force created by the Homeland Security Advisory Council is reviewing the plans to ensure consistency and consensus . The HSPD13 task force has issued its first report on three of the plans , identifying the need for strategic integration of programs within and between plans , the development of performance metrics and the clear assignment of responsibilities. ( n36 ) U.S. Programmatic Initiatives <p> The most obvious concern that has received the most political and public attention is the threat posed by the transit of millions of sealed containers through U.S. port cities . U.S. officials realized that they had only minimal knowledge of what was inside these containers and that lax security throughout the supply chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result , not surprisingly , has been that container security programs are the most developed part of the U.S. maritime security effort . These programs are briefly summarized below : <p> Customs-Trade Partnership against Terrorism ( C-TPAT ) : The C-TPAT is a public-private partnership . Its objectives are the adoption and sharing of stakeholder best practices and the adoption by supply-chain stakeholders of responsibility for security and minimizing the vulnerability of the supply chain to unwanted intrusion by a terrorist . The reward for private sector participants is accelerated clearance and reduced probability of inspection delays through promises of quicker processing by the Customs and Border Patrol ( CBP ) . <p> Container Security Initiative ( CSI ) : The objectives of CSI are to inspect and clear cargo in foreign ports before the cargo is shipped to the United States , recognizing that discovering a WMD after a container is offloaded in a U.S. port does little good ; improving the ability to identify high-risk containers ( i.e. , targeting inspection ) ; and improving technology to inspect and to track containers . CBP has deployed U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the customs inspectors of other countries . Both the CSI and C-TPAT are partnership programs that have attracted participants eager to work with U.S. Customs . Both , however , are difficult systems for small businesses , particularly in the developing world , to enter . <p> Operation Safe Commerce ( OSC ) : The objective of OSC is to develop and deploy technology that will assist in the detection of contraband . Grants for developing and testing container scanning and tracking technology and for the study of supply chains were made to major ports by TSA . OSC will improve detection capability for U.S. and international customs agents , should the supply chain be compromised . <p> The 24-Hour Rule : The CBP , authorized by the Trade Act of 2002 , has unilaterally imposed a 24-hour advance manifest rule that " obliges carriers and/or non-vessel operating common carriers ( freight forwarders acting as principal transport agents ) with automated data submission capabilities to submit a cargo declaration 24 hours before a container is to be loaded on board a vessel bound for the United States . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for targeted inspections of suspect containers prior to shipment . This rule , successfully implemented by regulation , became fully effective and enforced on 2 February 2003 . The 24-hour rule has significantly impacted the flexibility of loading ports and shippers by requiring information to be gathered and transmitted early in the booking cycle and by inhibiting the ability to make last-minute changes in bookings . Prior practice only required the master of a vessel to have the cargo manifest on board a vessel arriving in a U.S. port , and allowed shippers to change the final shipping information given to U.S. Customs up to 30 days after a container 's arrival in a U.S. port . <p> Automated Targeting System : Containers are potentially subject to three processes : screening ( i.e. , a review of documentation ) , scanning ( i.e. , a non-intrusive technological check of the container ) and inspection ( i.e. , physical check of the container and its contents ) . The 24-hour rule enables the U.S. CBP to screen all containers bound for the United States . CBP employs a computer-based modeling system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ( initially 55 ) of attributes in order to select containers for additional attention ( i.e. , scanning and/or inspection ) . The CBP is thought to identify approximately 6 percent of cargo containers as " high risk . " ( n38 ) <p> The effectiveness of container security measures to ensure the integrity of cargo throughout the supply chain , and the ability of CBP to effectively target their inspections , have been questioned by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) and the Congressional Research Service. ( n39 ) GAO questions whether the CBP has enough information to adequately model risk and make valid targeting decisions . Technology provides alternatives to targeted inspections . As reported in the Wall Street Journal , the port of Hong Kong is currently testing the scanning of 100 per cent of containers exported through the port with the Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) VACIS technology ( see below ) . ( n40 ) The CBP , how ever , has not shown a willingness to move away from a targeted inspection strategy . Measures applicable to all vessels and/or facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed approximately $600 million in port security grants directly to U.S. ports and port facilities that have identified projects that will reduce their vulnerability. ( n41 ) These grants , originally administered by the Maritime Administration ( MARAD ) , were assumed by the TSA , and finally were transferred to the Office of Domestic Preparedness ( ODP ) . MARAD , TSA and ODP have attempted to coordinate these grants with the Coast Guard-administered assessment of vulnerabilities of vessels and port facilities required by the MTSA , but a strategic vision of what these grants are to achieve has not been developed . <p> Advance Notice of Arrival : The 24-hour rule applies only to containerized cargo ; dry and liquid bulk-cargo vessels are exempt . However , in October 2001 , the Coast Guard modified its **25;2370;TOOLONG requirements for commercial vessels . Under the old rules vessels had to give 24 hours ' notice before arrival in U.S. ports . The new notice time was 96 hours . This temporary requirement was made permanent in February 2003 , expanding the information collected to include extensive information on the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Coast Guard Vessel Boarding Programs : Prior to allowing them to enter a U.S. port , the Coast Guard boards and inspects all vessels identified as " High Interest Vessels " through information gathered from the Advanced Notice of Arrival system and intelligence sources . The Coast Guard also boards every vessel on its first visit to the United States after the effective date of the MTSA. ( n43 ) <p> Oversight of Seafarers and Port Workers : The Coast Guard has direct authority to regulate U.S. seafarers and port workers . The Coast Guard and FBI have implemented a review of U.S. merchant mariner credentials , " Operation Drydock , " to ensure that persons with links to terrorist groups do not sail on U.S. flagships . The Coast Guard is also working with DOT to include port workers in the Transportation Workers Identity Card ( TWIC ) biometric identification program , and has recently introduced **26;2397;TOOLONG seafarers licenses. ( n44 ) The U.S. State Department , the CBP and the Coast Guard are addressing the more difficult process of identifying and controlling the entry of foreign seafarers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew list to both the Coast Guard and CBP The Immigration and Nationality Act allows seafarers and aircrews to enter the United States if they are listed on the crew list visa . After 9/11 , the Coast Guard and CBP prevented seafarers without individual visas from disembarking . The State Department issued a rule on 18 March 2004 terminating crew visa list privileges and requiring all seafarers to hold individual visas with identifying bio metrics . <p> Surveillance of the Maritime and Port Environment : The Coast Guard and U.S. Navy have created Maritime Intelligence Fusion Centers that compile , synthesize and disseminate intelligence relating to maritime threats. ( n45 ) Both the Coast Guard and Navy have increased their ability to patrol littoral waters and to interdict and board suspect vessels . The Navy under the Proliferation Security Initiative is prepared to board vessels in international waters to stop the potential dissemination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction , in spite of potential conflict with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. ( n46 ) The Coast Guard has created Maritime Safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to patrol U.S. ports and waterways . The America 's Waterway Watch program encourages members of the private sector and individual citizens to report suspicious activities . Discussion of Technologies <p> Innovative technology has been applied to the problem of maritime security in two general areas : ( 1 ) container security and ( 2 ) vessel identification and surveillance . The advancements in container security include the CBP automated commercial environment , which provides the information necessary to target inspections ; improved non-intrusive scanning technology ; and the creation of sensor equipped containers . Prior to 9/11 , and despite two decades of advances in electronic data interchange , the flow of information within the supply chain 's transaction layer and between the transaction layer and the oversight layer was slow and paper-driven . The most revolutionary technological change caused by U.S. government security initiatives , and the least visible , is the automation of this information flow , which allows the effective screening of containers prior to shipment . The second area of improvement is the development of technologies to track containers and to ensure their physical integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency identification that can track sensors ; sensors that can detect chemicals and radiation ; sensors that detect and the record intrusions and other anomalies ; and anti-tamper seals . An industry consortium , the Strategic technological change Council on Security Technology of pilot tests of sensor technology called Smart and Secure Tradelines ( SST ) . ( n47 ) For example , the Department of Defense ( DOD ) and SAVI Technology have developed an SST pilot that uses these technologies to ensure the security of the DOD supply chain. ( n48 ) Nonintrusive inspections of containers have been improved with radiation monitors , portal sensors and remote monitoring technologies . The SAIC-developed VACIS system uses a gamma-ray imaging system to produce radiographic images that may be transmitted or stored . A mobile VACIS unit may be set up in 10 minutes and can scan a 40-foot container in six seconds. ( n49 ) <p> VACIS technology is also being applied to the problem of maritime domain awareness  --  identifying vessels and monitoring those with suspicious cargoes , behavior or ownership . International requirements for AIS and SSAS are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are utilizing satellite technology and air borne sensors to locate and track vessels in the maritime domain , and both organizations plan to add unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) to the mix . The Coast Guard is purchasing Bell Eagle Eye UAVs as part of its fleet modernization program. ( n50 ) Enhancing communication and information technologies will be required to make the National Maritime Intelligence Integration Center an effective reality . Strategic Gaps and Unresolved Issues <p> The cumulative effort described above is an unprecedented attempt to significantly change the behavior of the maritime system in a relatively short time period . The criteria of preserving efficiency , improving reliability , achieving transparency , improving fault tolerance and improving resilience of the global supply chain , as suggested by Willis and Ortiz , provide a good basis for review of the effect of these programs and measures . <p> Efficiency . International and national maritime-security policy statements stress maintaining the efficiency of the system , or keeping America " open for business . " However , the container security programs implemented thus far have changed the supply chain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , they are changing inventory strategies from " just in time " to " just in case . " ( n51 ) UNCTAD has attempted to categorize and estimate the costs of implementing container security programs . The most significant costs  --  increasing inventories due to the unpredictability of supply-chain interruptions caused by security measures ; the disproportionate focus on small suppliers and developing countries unable to implement CSI and C-TPAT standards ; and the potential impact of interruptions to critical nodes  --  have not been estimated . <p> Reliability . The primary goals of programs to date have been improving the security of U.S. ports and of the flow of containerized cargo . The thrust of all the initiatives has come in the form of government-imposed rules and programs . The business case for security has not been made to or accepted by many participants in the global supply chain . This leads to four unresolved issues . <p> ( 1 ) The primary supply-chain vulnerabilities are at the ends of the chain  --  in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport ( i.e. , road stops ) and in rail yards . The physical security of these private sector assets throughout the world is critical and extremely difficult to ensure . <p> ( 2 ) Security of ships and cargo in foreign ports is beyond the effective control of the U.S. government . It is the responsibility of foreign governments and private companies , and making the diplomatic and business case to achieve cooperation is difficult . <p> ( 3 ) The focus on container vessels has led to an underestimation of the vulnerabilities of other subsystems . There is no tanker or bulk-cargo analogy to CSI or C-TPAT , nor are tankers and bulk cargoes subject to the 24-hour rule . The certainty that the threat is external to the United States has led to an under investment in reducing the vulnerability to shore-side security threats , in particular the threat to passenger ferries and cruise ships , so potential mass casualty targets remain vulnerable to conventional attack . <p> ( 4 ) The piecemeal implementation of global security programs has created a system without measurable risk-management objectives . International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how safe is safe " question . Now they must attempt to define acceptable security . What , for example , is an acceptable probability that a container with terrorist contraband will enter the United States undetected in any given year ? The answer to this drives the direct and indirect costs of security interventions , affecting the efficiency of the supply chain and the need for effective fault-tolerance and resilience strategies . <p> Transparency . The IM0 , the United States and the European Union are addressing the transparency issue . Much progress has been made on containerized cargo , but much remains to be done concerning the ownership , operation and crewing of vessels . Bulk carriers in particular are often one-ship companies , with opaque ownership and operators , operating under flags of convenience without effective oversight . <p> Fault Tolerance and Resilience : These two system elements are closely related and must be part of a comprehensive risk-management strategy . Risk can not be reduced to zero ; we can not eliminate all threats or vulnerabilities . We must therefore be prepared for post-event risk management interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been vulnerability-focused , with little attention given to resilience and recovery strategies . The Transportation Research Board found organizational and readiness deficiencies in U.S. marine firefighting and marine salvage capabilities that could seriously affect the ability to contain the impacts of a terrorist attack on a U.S. port. ( n52 ) The global supply chain remains vulnerable to critical nodes , as the United States discovered with the Hurricane Katrina-caused disruption of a significant portion of its energy supply and distribution system , and with the labor conflict that closed West Coast ports in 2004 . While the U.S. government is preparing to respond to another terrorist attack , little effort is being made to reduce our dependence on critical physical nodes , to prevent cascading failures or to assist in economic recovery should an attack on the supply chain occur . <p> By necessity , domestic and international maritime security programs have been implemented in parallel to the creation of a coherent strategy and before the development of any measures of effectiveness . The result has been the collection of pro grams and efforts described above , which overlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national and international efforts is impossible to assess . The programs created first have been those that were the easiest to implement , such as improving the physical security of our ports through port security grants , improving our monitoring of the system ( AIS , Advanced Notice of Arrival , 24-hour rule ) , and improving supply-chain security through better collaboration with cooperative companies ( C-TPAT , OSC ) and countries ( CSI ) . These initiatives all require some level of compliance and cooperation from governments , vessel owners and operators , shippers and other private sector supply-chain participants . However , the maritime world has always had a proportion of owners and operators who intentionally operate at the margins of legality , avoiding oversight and enforcement whenever possible , and of governments that allow them to do so. ( n53 ) Terrorists are intelligent foes who will find the soft spots in the system ; we will have to find and fix these soft spots . Thus far , U.S. and international initiatives have added rules , procedures and technology to improve security without changing the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to achieve adequate maritime security , however , more fundamental changes may be necessary The seas have long been viewed as a stateless space , transited by vessels answerable only to the authorities of the flag that they fly and to those countries whose territorial waters they enter . Are we prepared to invest the political capital necessary to increase the transparency of and oversight in the system until we know who owns and operates vessels operating worldwide , to have trusted and secure supply chains for all cargoes , to monitor and control movement of vessels approaching or passing U.S. waters , and to ensure that the ranks of seafarers do not include terrorists ? CONCLUSION <p> The threat is real . Terrorist organizations have demonstrated access to maritime commerce at all levels . The vulnerabilities are significant and difficult to eliminate . Each maritime subsystem has its own set of vulnerabilities that must be individually but systemically addressed . A determined , intelligent foe can be expected to discover and exploit the weakest link in each subsystem . The physical and economic consequences of an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others have correctly pointed out that the investment in maritime and port security when compared to other homeland security expenditures , notably aviation security has not been consistent with the relative risk . However , we must resist the temptation of believing that we can buy ourselves a secure world . Investing in things we can do and things we understand , and seeking technology-intensive solutions , will not eliminate low-technology threats . <p> An effective domestic and global strategy will require effective international and domestic coordination . The international coordination must involve private sector stakeholders that have long ensured the safety of the system , such as insurers and classification societies , and industry associations like the International Chamber of Shipping ; the International Association of Classification Societies ; BIMCO , representing 65 percent of the worlds bulk and tanker fleet ; and the International Council of Cruise Lines . Domestic coordination will require continued coordination of national security and homeland security , a process explicitly recognized by HSPDI.3/NSPD4I . In particular , the coordination between the Coast Guard and Navy and the USCG , CBP and TSA must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the final analysis , we are going to have to rely on others-foreign countries , foreign-national suppliers , shippers , and operators-to retrofit security into a complex set of global subsystems that are the basis for our trade and prosperity . This will require the development of clear , inclusive strategies and goals and extensive outreach to the international community and private sector . A holistic , systems-oriented approach is emerging from international initiatives ( e.g. , ISPSC ) , domestic legislative and regulatory initiatives ( e.g. , MTSA ) , public-private partnerships ( C-TPAT , OSC ) , government to government partnerships ( CSI ) , federal investment in ports ( port security grants program ) and agency initiatives . The current effort directed by HSPD13/NSPD41 to develop an integrated national strategy for maritime security , under the cognizance of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council , recognizes both the strategic importance of maritime security issues and the need to involve a wide range of government agencies in addressing a strategic response to these issues . The government is trying to integrate homeland security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop new strategies using Cold War structures and conceptual frameworks may be unworkable , as Flynn claims. ( n54 ) It remains to be seen whether new approaches are required . <p>
