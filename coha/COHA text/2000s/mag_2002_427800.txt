BUYING $2,999 ***** BUY IT IF You value simplicity over sophistication-and do n't mind paying for it . FORGET IT IF You need affordability or superior suspension technology . 7 WORDS ABOUT THIS BIKE Hand-built . Laterally stiff . Forgiving ride . Fair value . Steel Ride Hand-Crafted for the Purist YOU NEED THIS BIKE BECAUSE .. you 're looking to buy one bike to last your whole life long . I 'm not saying other bikes will crumble to dust in two or three years , but from the standpoint of simplicity and ride quality , the Team Marin will never go out of style . Suspension bikes have their drawbacks : Designs still see tweaks every year , shock technology still has n't reached its apex and pivots still require a thorough looking-after . High-end aluminum hardtails can almost mimic the ride quality of steel , but that duplication comes at the cost of durability  --  chances are your pricey alu hardtail wo n't last a third as long as your trusty steel ride . Whether you 're a racer or an adventure rider , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico or in the muddy slop of eastern Pennsylvania , the Team Marin is up for the challenge . Quick on the climbs ( thanks mainly to its overall light weight ) and stable on the descents , this handmade Nor-Cal off-roader is the quintessential jack-of-all-trades . And while we say the hardtail has seen its day , there still remains room for that rider who appreciates the simplicity and function of a welltimed steel mountain bike . The Team Marin offers that rider the chance to own handcrafted quality ( although not truly custom ) at a price lower than that of a part-by-part put-together.If you ca n't manage to choke down the $3000 price tag , keep in mind Marin also offers the Team Marin in two other more-affordable configurations-as a $2300 complete bike with a Deore XT parts package or as a $999 frame . PROFILE Classic steel hardtail tuned for the twenty-first century . BEST THING ABOUT THIS BIKE The highly tuned ride . Almost all steel frames exhibit forgiving ride quality , but many can not overcome lateral flex issues . Here , Columbus Foco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shaped and butted to provide the very best characteristics of steel  --  a fairly light , laterally stiff ride with heavenly forgiveness . WORST THING The price . Full suspension 's widespread acceptance makes it hard to justify a $3,000 hardtail . Sure , this frame is hand-built in California and rides exceptionally well , but it 's only the dedicated , hell-bent-on-simplicity retro-rider who will appreciate this pricey ride . And while the high-end components make this bike a goon value , there are a few small builders ( such as Strong and Gunnar ) who can custom build a frame to your exact specifications for the $999 frame-only price of this bike . QUIRKS A few mysterious parts selections find their way on board , such as the too  --  wide and bulky WTB Laser V saddle , Marin 's house-brand Ovation stem and middle-ofthe-road Grease-Guard  --  wannabe WTB Momentum Comp headset BRAGGING RIGHTS Simplicity . There 's still something magical about the ride of a smartly tuned steel hardtail .
