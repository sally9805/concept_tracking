SWAMP EAT ANYTHING , GIVE it enough time , my daddy used to say , and soon as I heard the census taker 's automobile outside my store , I knew that it would wind up swamp food before all was said and done . Take a fool to bring a car this deep into the Atchafalaya - a fool or a Yankee , one - and after the trouble we 'd had with Billy Go that morning , I was n't in the mood to deal with either one . But when I stepped out on the porch of my store and saw the boy sitting behind the wheel , I knew that he was both . <p> He was a colored boy , this one . His face gleamed the shade of swamp water when you sweep the duckweed back , and his eyes were calm behind his wire-rimmed spectacles as he gazed out at us . Folks had already started gathering round , half of them gaping at the road , the other half at the car itself . Somebody reached out and touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been burned . One of Janie Halloway 's younguns , it was , Odile , a no-count seventeen-year-old with a cap of bristly hair and skin the color of mud . He ought a been busy at something this time of day-it was getting on toward four-and I made a mental note to have a word with Janie . Just now , though , I had bigger fish to fry . <p> " Ya 'll go on , " I said quietly , and the crowd - there must have been a dozen of them , colored folks and white ones too - kind of jumped like they 'd been caught stealing . " Get on , now , " I said . " You heard me . " <p> I clapped my hands and then they jumped all right . Just like that the street was empty . I stood there in the heat , staring past the car at the road , two narrow gravel ruts and a hummock of wire grass winding away through a sunshot dapple of tree and scrub . The car itself was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was more car than folks here in Sulphur Creek had ever seen . Then I saw the sign affixed to the driver 's side door , and my heart kind of sank within me . <p> What it said , that sign , was Doom . <p> What it said was , United States Census . <p> The colored boy turned off his motor and got out . He wore a pair of linen pants and a clean button-down shirt . He reached back inside for a leather valise and then shut the door . My old hound tore out from under the house at the sound , barking his stupid head off . " Hist , Booger , " I shouted , " settle down now , " and he pulled up short , grinning like an idiot . he stood there a moment , his tongue hanging out , and then he flopped over on his side in the grass . I glanced at the stranger by way of apology . " Fool animal 's bout worthless , " I said . " Take him a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colored boy did n't say anything . He just stared at the sign above the porch . GENERAL MERCHANDISE . ULYSSES DECOTEAU , PROPRIETOR , it says , in fancy letters weathered almost the shade of the wood they 're painted on . " Are you Mr. Decoteau ? " he asked , and right away I saw I was right about him being a Yankee . He had a way of swallowing his vowels before he 'd hardly got a taste of them . It had no music , that voice . <p> " Yes and no , " I said . " Ulysses Decoteau - that was my father - died in ' 61 . My name 's Armand . I run the place now . " <p> The colored boy studied on this for a minute . he looked up the street in a way that let me see it through his eyes : not a street at all , really , just a couple of ruts winding between a cluster of weather-beaten shanties on stilts , the way folks build in these parts on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines of Virginia creeper shooting up the sides of our houses and festooning our eaves with dangling gray shrouds of Spanish moss . Coco grass and palmetto choked our door yards . If we did n't hack the stuff back every now and then , Sulphur Creek would just disappear , swallowed up in a slow-rising emerald tide . Appetite , that 's all the swamp is . And this colored boy just stood there , taking it all in with a look on his face that told me he did n't know places this backward still existed in those proud United States of his . <p> " And you ? " I said . " What 's your name ? " <p> He glanced up , startled , and smiled the shiniest smile I ever saw , like a bright crescent moon waxing slowly toward full in the middle of his face . " I did n't mean to be rude , Mr. Decoteau . My name is Lucas Dixon . I 'm pleased to make your acquaintance . " he took the stairs in a bound and shook my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye , like a white man . Then he turned to gaze back at his car and the gravel road beyond it , tunneling off through the swamp like a mirage , green tinted and improbably dry . " I do n't know how I ended up here . I was trying to reach Evangeline , I came up 31 from New Iberia - " <p> " You a long way from Evangeline and New Iberia both , boy . " <p> " I can tell that . Question is : where am I ? " <p> I did n't know what to say to that , so I just stood there in the heat . Sweat trickled into my eyes and when I went to brush it away , my hands trembled . A dark foreboding filled me . I sighed , cursing this Yankee nigger and his government job and whatever fate had seen fit to bring him here . And then I did what I knew I had to do . <p> " Sulphur Creek , " I said . " I reckon you better come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucas Dixon paused , emitting a slow rising whistle , like a tea kettle just coming to a boil . " Wow , " he said in a voice pitched just above a whisper , and I had that queer sense that I was seeing Sulphur Creek through his eyes again , a sepia-toned snapshot out of some lost past . Everything swam in green twilight : the bright moted squares of the windows , the sagging shelves of canned goods and tools , Hiram behind the counter , a shadow amid shadows . A ceiling fan shoved the smells of cheese and dust around . <p> Maybe a decade ago , I hauled a diesel generator back from Morgan City , dragging a scrap of the twentieth century home to Sulphur Creek just as the rest of the world lurched headlong toward the twenty-first . My daddy would have disapproved , but that fan felt just fine on a hot summer day . Even then , with everything else weighing on my mind , I could n't help lifting my head to catch the air against my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch us a couple cold drinks from the cooler . When I turned around , I saw that Dixon had wandered over toward drygoods , where he was rubbing a bolt of cloth between two fingers and gazing about with an expression of thunderstruck delight on his face . " Wow ! " he said again . He pivoted on his heels like a weathercock , uncurtaining all those shiny teeth . " I hope you wo n't take offense , Mr. Decoteau , but this place is a time capsule . " <p> I did n't know what to say to that either , so I just ushered him in the direction of the rockers that sit back by the grocery counter . By the time I got him settled , Hiram had turned up with the sodas . We sat there sipping while Hiram stepped out to sweep off the front porch . " Nothin beats an ice-cold Coca-Cola on a hot day , does it , " I said . <p> Dixon tilted his soda to his lips and took a long swig . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here . " <p> " Where bouts you from , then ? " <p> " Albany , New York . " He turned to face me . " I really do hope you do n't take offense , Mr. Decoteau , but your store - " He gazed around appreciatively once again . " - your store is like a dream come true . I 'm working on my Ph.D . over at LSU , specializing in the rural economy during Reconstruction , and this place , well , it 's like stepping inside my dissertation . " <p> " Your dissertation . " <p> " That 's right . History . " He gave me a shy smile . " It sounds ridiculous , I guess , but I do love history . " <p> " Sign on your car says you work for the United States Census Bureau . " <p> " That 's just summer work . I track down non-responders , see if I can get them to answer a few questions . Did you fill out your census form , Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . " Do n't tell me . You thought it was an invasion of your privacy . " <p> " Well - " <p> " The thing people fail to understand , " Dixon said , " is that the government uses that data to help people . Take that street out front . Using census data , you could probably get the funding to pave that street , put in some proper drainage . " He 'd been digging in his briefcase while he talked . Now he produced a thick file and began thumbing through it . " I know it 's just summer work , " he was saying , " but I like to think of the service I 'm doing for history , gathering all these facts . I like to imagine some future historian .... " He trailed off , his brow furrowing . " That 's funny . Did you say the name of this place is Sulphur Creek ? " <p> " That 's right . " <p> He studied the page for another moment and then looked up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a census form , Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> " That 's what I wanted to talk to you about , Mr. Di - " <p> " Lucas . Why do n't you call me , Lucas ? " <p> " We do value our privacy here in Sulphur Creek , Mr. Dixon . Lucas . <p> That 's what I brought you in here to tell you . " " <p> I understand that , Mr. Decoteau . But census data is completely confiden - " <p> " We 're just very private folk - " <p> Dixon rolled on over me . " I have some forms . We could take them around town , have people fill them out - " <p> " Mr. Dixon , " I said sharply . <p> He paused , a little startled I think . <p> " Mr. Dixon , " I said , softer now . " Lucas . I 'm trying to make you understand something , see ? " <p> " I 'm just trying to help . " <p> " I know . I know you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for you and me both , is if you would just get in your car and get on out of here now . That 's what I 'm trying to say , you understand . " <p> Lucas Dixon wavered . I could see him trying to work it out - not just my words , but the words behind my words , if you take my meaning - and for a moment I thought I had persuaded him . He slid his papers back into his briefcase , and just for the space it took him to latch the cover I let myself believe that I had managed everything just that neatly . A vivid little fantasy took hold of me . In the fantasy , Lucas Dixon thanked me for the Coke , walked out to his car , and drove back down the gravel road that had brought him here . I stood on the porch and listened as the sound of his engine faded , swallowed up in the sleepy buzz of the swamp . <p> But it was too late for that . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front screen whined on its hinges . Stelly Broussard and Avery Verrett came in . Their white faces hung disembodied in the gloom as they stared the length of the store . <p> " We came soon 's we heard , " Stelly said . <p> I got to my feet , nodding . " Stelly , " I said . " Avery . This here is Lucas Dixon . " <p> Dixon stood , still clutching his satchel , and went to meet them . He held out his hand . Avery hesitated a moment - he never was too bright , Avery - and then he took the hand and shook it , ginger-like , the way a man picks up something that might be dead and then again might not be , something with teeth . Stelly just stood there , the moment spinning out awkwardly until Dixon at last drew his hand back . The whole thing like to make me sick . <p> " What the hell we gon na do , Armand ? " Stelly said . <p> " Now just listen - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you 're right , Mr. Decoteau . Maybe I 'll just go after all . " <p> Stelly Broussard did n't like the sound of that . His face kind of pinched in on itself , growing still harder and more hateful , and it had been plenty of both to begin with . He looked like a man who went to bite into a rind of sweet watermelon , and got a mouthful of lemon instead . Stelly 's an old-timer like me , but his years in the swamp have n't worn him down the way they do some folks . Five decades of running traplines for nutria and muskrat had left him rangy and quick , impervious to injury . I 've seen him take colored boys apart , they get the least bit uppity . He 's got a way with those big hands of his , Stelly Broussard has . <p> " Now , do n't be hasty , " I said . <p> They just stood there , staring at me . Stelly was mad , and when Stelly was mad , Avery did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Dixon ... well , Dixon just seemed puzzled . A little nervous , maybe , but mainly puzzled . In his way , I think , Lucas Dixon was as dense as Avery Verrett ever thought about being . <p> Me , I was thinking that if I could get Stelly alone , calm him down a little , I might find a way out of this yet . I did n't want to like Lucas Dixon , but somehow I could n't help it . His words kept coming back to me <p> - it sounds ridiculous , Mr. Decoteau , but I do love history <p> - and getting tangled up inside my head with that gravel road cutting through the Atchafalaya , so clean and dry that God Himself might have put it there , and maybe he did . And then it came to me - not a solution , exactly , but a way to buy a little time . <p> " I 've reconsidered your proposal , Mr. Dixon , " I said , " seein as you 're so dedicated and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here says he might be able to get us a little money , maybe we can pave the street out front . He just needs to ask a few questions . " <p> " What the hell we need with a paved street - " <p> " I was thinking maybe Avery could show him around a bit , let him ask a few questions , while you and me , Stelly , we have us a little talk . " <p> I let my eyes bore into him , summoning up my daddy 's ghost inside me . After a minute , Stelly turned away . <p> " You heard the man , Avery , " he said . <p> " Where you want I should take him ? " <p> " You take him round the better sort of folks for now , " Stelly said . <p> Dixon frowned . " I need to count everyone , Mr. Decoteau . " <p> " By and by . You let Avery show you around , you catch up with the rest this evening . " <p> " This evening ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little country dance , you know . History buff like yourself , you 'll enjoy it . Avery 'll bring you round . " <p> Avery nodded . He pushed the door open , but Dixon held back , still clutching that bag of his . " Mr. Decoteau - " <p> " Do n't you fret , Mr. Dixon . You go on and ask your questions . We 'll get you on the right road soon enough . " <p> He held my gaze a moment longer before he turned away . The screen door banged shut behind him , and then Stelly Broussard and I were alone . <p> Stelly stood there a moment , staring after them . The Sun slanting through the screen tattooed a grid of fine lines on his face . The air had that still , sleepy quality it gets late in the afternoon . The heat comes off the water in waves then , gilding everything with a faint damp sheen you can almost taste . The fan creaked . Hiram 's broom made a steady rasp in the silence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , his boots calling up echoes in the stillness . " You see that road out there ? " <p> " I seen it . " <p> " A road . " He shook his head . " A goddamn road . " <p> I lowered myself gingerly into my rocker . I had never felt older or wearier . I could have curled up and slept right there in my chair and never woke up again , and glad to do it , too . But Stelly would n't let me . <p> " What we gon na do , Armand ? " <p> " I do n't know , Stelly . I 'm thinkin on it , do n't you see . " <p> " Thinkin ! " He laughed , a short ugly bark , without humor . <p> " Why do n't you sit down ? " <p> " Sit down , " he said . He leveled one blunt finger at me , right in my face . The finger shook . " You know what , Armand ? I 'm right tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you doin here , then ? " <p> Stelly cursed and turned away . The silence held for a while . I could feel the pulse beating at my temple . <p> Stelly sighed . " Hell , Armand . I 've known you all my life . All I 'm sayin is that maybe you 're losin your heart to do what you have to do . Take this business with Billy Go - " <p> " I did what was necessary , did n't I ? " <p> " You let it be done . You did n't have the stomach to do it yourself . " I did n't have any answer to that . I just sat there , rocking a little , lifting my face to the fan . I closed my eyes , willing it all away . But it would n't go , and I knew it would n't go . For sixty-odd years now , I 'd been closing my eyes and willing it all away , and it would n't ever go . It was always there around me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daddy 's store and on and on all the way back to the day of Mr. Jefferson Davis himself and before that even , each successive generation of Decoteaus treading deeper the groove that ran behind the grocery counter and down either side of the store to drygoods and hardware . The store was always there , and beyond that the town , and beyond that the swamp , huge and dangerous and stranger than most anyone could know or guess . And beyond that ? Another world , that 's what . Now a little piece of that world named Lucas Dixon had settled here among us ; blown willy nilly down that gravel road from nowhere , and I would have to decide what to do about him . <p> All I wanted to do was shut my eyes . <p> But Sulphur Creek kept crashing in . In the ring of Stelly Broussard 's boots on the floor Hiram had polished to a high gloss that very morning and in the labored sigh he made as he settled into the rocker beside me and in the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has lain too long in the shadow of a willow , where the Sun ca n't reach - in all that and more , Sulphur Creek came crashing in upon me . <p> Stelly plucked at my sleeve . " I knew your daddy , too , Armand - " <p> " You leave him out of this . " <p> " Well he would n't have approved , you can be sure enough of that . " He studied the floor for a minute . Then , lifting his face so that the light fell across it , he said , " Maybe you done enough , Armand , that 's all I 'm sayin . Maybe it 's time to let this burden pass to someone else . " <p> " You volunteerin , Stelly ? " <p> He did n't answer . <p> " Because if you 're volunteerin , you might want to ask yourself what it is you 're volunteerin for . It 's more than keepin the likes of Odile Halloway in line and organizin the fais-dodo come Saturday night . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ai n't talkin about your pissant nutria and muskrat lines , Stelly . I 'm talkin about seein that everybody has a little somethin to eat come nightfall . I 'm talkin about the supply run down Morgan City , the long run through the deep , strange water farther out than you ever tried to go . The night closes in around you out there , Stelly . You hear things like no other man ever heard before , and sometimes you see them too . Eight or ten times a year , I make that run , and it ai n't never the same . " <p> " I ai n't afraid of nothin . " <p> " You 're a bigger fool than I took you for , then . " <p> Stelly jerked his head up , his eyes blazing , and his fingers tightened on the arms of his chair until I thought the wood might splinter under the pressure . He got to his feet stiffly . He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . " I 'll leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what has to be done . Mark my words : if you ai n't willin to see it through , there 's some who will . " <p> He did n't look back as he strode to the door . <p> The screen swung shut behind him . I felt wrung out and weary , and when I lifted my Coke to my lips I found it had gone brackish and warm . After a time , I realized that the sound of Hiram 's sweeping had died away . I got to my feet and went to the door . Hiram sat on the steps with the broom propped between his knees , staring out at Lucas Dixon 's motor car and the gravel road beyond it , veering off through the swamp to a place Hiram had never seen . " Now look here , Hiram , " I started , but when he lifted his face to mine , I just let the words trail off . I could n't find it in my heart to scold him . <p> NIGHT NEVER LEAVES the Atchafalaya , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the rest of the swamp creatures . Live in the swamp long enough , you 'll see her pooled in the deep cypress groves or hiding out in the black depths of a mangrove thicket , patient arid sure , biding her time . Now and then , you 'll catch a glimpse of her in midday , in the wind-driven shudder of a palmetto leaf or in the languid dapple of Spanish moss , draping the trees like castoff wedding finery , ivory veils aging slowly to an antique gray . Then the Sun starts down . Slowly , imperceptibly , night takes hold . She steals invisibly across the water , like smoke ; she spills out from the wells of shadow beneath our houses . Night 's like love . She creeps in and takes possession of everything you ever knew or hoped to know without so much as a by your leave . She takes dominion of your heart before you ever know she 's there . <p> I woke in darkness , relieved , thinking I had dreamed it all-that crazy road appearing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of his car , that one that spelled doom sure as I could feel the blood coursing in my veins . The windows were black and the intermittent gusts from the fan carried a chill that had n't been there before . Night had claimed Sulphur Creek , carrying with it faint strains of music . <p> The fais-dodo had gotten underway . I heaved myself out of my chair and ambled over to look through the screen . At the edge of the porch , Booger lifted his head and yawned . The music was louder here , a fiddle and a ting-a-ling and Louis Mayard 's high tenor , lifted in some old Cajun song . Down the street a way , Ruby Lafitte 's place was lit up like a jack-o ' - lantern . Folks gathered on the porch , drinking and talking in the smoky radiance from within . <p> I yawned and gave myself a good scratching . Then I opened the screen door , letting it bang shut behind me . Startled voices rose out of the shadows below the porch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sfot , Odile - " <p> - stood out unmistakably . A car door slammed and boys scattered into darkness like a covey of startled quail . I caught a glimpse of Odile Halloway and I felt a little twinge of sorrow , knowing that he was starting down the same doomed path Billy Go had taken before him . It sickened me a little , to tell you the truth . And it sickened me even more to know that I had n't been dreaming after all . That gravel road was still there , and so was Lucas Dixon 's car . One door still stood open where them boys had been peering in at the dash . A light was shining inside . <p> I stepped down off the porch and shut the door , and then I stood there , staring up the street toward Ruby 's place . I felt strange and haunted , somehow . Someone stood at my shoulder , but I did n't turn around . I knew better than that . <p> " Daddy , " I said by way of greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say whether they were coming out of memory , or from some other place , some cold , cold place where words formed slow and hard as diamonds if they formed at all . They were Daddy 's words , though , and I remembered when he said them . He was already an old man , then , and I think we both knew he did n't have much time . <p> They 'll come a time , he said , you 'll have to do somethin you wo n't want to do , Armand . But you 'll have to do it , anyway , because that 's what a man does . <p> I sighed and started up the street toward Ruby 's place . <p> As I drew near Ruby 's , I could pick out the words in Louis 's song , an old Cajun lament . Someone spotted me from the porch and called out , " Hey there , Armand , " and a chorus of greetings followed . The regulars had gathered on the porch to play cards , same as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eunice Ray bustled around freshening drinks , her dark skin glossy with sweat . The air smelled of whiskey and tobacco , smells that reminded me of my daddy , rocking there on the front porch of the store , staring out across Sulphur Creek like he owned the place . I caught a glimpse of Stelly , his chair cocked back against the wall with its front legs off the ground . He nodded over his cards . <p> " Deal you in , Armand ? " someone asked . <p> " Thank you , no . " <p> As I started toward the stairs , somebody plucked at my sleeve . Turning , I saw Hiram 's long face peering around the corner . I let him draw me into the shadows at the side of the house . Through the windows , I watched Eduis Fruge pumping away on his squeeze box . They 'd pushed Ruby 's furniture back along the walls . Dancers whirled in the clear space , their faces shiny as new money . <p> " You ai n't got enough to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I been waitin for you . " <p> " Waitin ? You know where to find me . " <p> " I'se ascared to come back down the store , Mistah Armand . " <p> The light from inside touched up half his face , leaving the other side in shadow . I could n't see much but the angle of his jaw , and the white of his eye above it , marbled and weepy looking in the darkness . His lower lip trembled . <p> " Scared . Why 's that ? " <p> " Odile and them others . If I'se to say anything , they said they 'd whip up on me . " <p> I took a step toward him . " What are you talkin about ? " <p> " They gon na steal that colored man 's automobile . " He stumbled a little over the unfamiliar word . " Said they 's done sick and tired of Sulphur Creek , said they 's gon na break Billy Go loose and just drive on outta here . " <p> " Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You allus treat me right , Mistah Armand , and I thought you ought to know , but I sure am ascared . " <p> " You ai n't got nothin to fear , Hiram . " <p> " They said they 'd whip up - " <p> " Hush now . That colored boy , Dixon , you seen him inside ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " What about Janie Halloway ? " <p> " She in the kitchen . " <p> " All right , then . You go on and lend a hand . I 'll step back there in a minute and have a word with her . And do n't you worry none , Odile would n't know how to drive that car even if he could get it started , you hear ? I 'll take care of Odile Halloway , you ai n't got nothin to fear from the likes of him . " <p> " Yes , sir . " He hesitated . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " Odile , he say there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mistah Armand . Say all kinds of colored folk drive em and ai n't nobody to say a word about it . " <p> For some reason , the words moved me . It was nothin I could put into words , but I felt a little twist inside me all the same . Hiram had been working in the store since he were n't but knee high to a grasshopper , and I guess I 'd gotten accustomed to him . I never took a wife and I 've brought no children into this world , but I 'd taken a shine to Hiram , even if he were just a colored boy . I wanted to say something to comfort him , but I could n't seem to find the words . Finally , I just reached out and touched him on the shoulder . " Do n't you put no stock in Odile Halloway , " I said . " He ai n't nothin but swamp gas and bother , that one . Now run along . " <p> Hiram stared at me a moment longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the music quickened , Louis 's voice rising to a doleful wail . Quel espoir , quel espoir , he sang as the song climaxed in a flurry of whoops and claps . In the silence that followed , I felt that presence at my shoulder once again . This time , though , I did n't say a word . I just spat into the dirt , and as the music started up again , I trudged back around the house . <p> Out front , the old-timers were still at it . Stelly fixed me with his gaze and let his chair legs thump to the floor as I mounted the stairs . A couple of the card-players glanced up , too , men I 'd known all my life . And now I saw something in their eyes I had n't noticed before : a feral sheen of expectation . Stelly 's words came back to me <p> - you ai n't willin to see it through , there 's some who will <p> - as I brushed past them and yanked the screen open . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything seemed slightly off-kilter , the music a hair more frantic than usual , the dancers somehow reckless , as if they could n't move fast enough - as if they were dancing with the devil hindmost and hell before em . A smell of whiskey and chicken gumbo hung in the air , and the sticky press of too many bodies in too small a space . I nodded at folks as I slipped by , aiming for the kitchen and Janie Halloway . <p> " Mr. Decoteau ! " <p> Somebody tugged at my sleeve . I turned and there was Lucas Dixon , still cradling that battered leather case . He hovered at the edge of the dance floor . Folks veered about him to the left and right . They studied him askance , never quite meeting his eyes . He seized my hand . If he was aware of the stir he was causing , he did n't show it . <p> " Mr. Decoteau , " he said , his voice pitched so I could hear him above the music . " Mr. Verrett - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed to talk to . " <p> " Me ? " <p> " Are you the mayor of Sulphur Creek , Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> " Mayor ? No , I 'm - " I paused , thinking how to put it into words . A place like Sulphur Creek , the store is more than just a store . Day after day , year after year , women gossip across its counters , children crowd its aisles , old men gather to whittle on the porch . A man stands behind that counter long enough , he becomes ... well , more than just another man . Folks look to him , somehow . It had been true of my father and it was true of me , too . It were n't nothing official . It just was , because that 's the way it always had been . But there did n't seem to be any way to make Dixon understand any of that . I sighed . " I 'm just the storekeep , that 's all , Mr. Dixon . " <p> Dixon nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verrett said I was to talk to you . " <p> " What was it you wanted to ask me about ? " <p> " I was thinking if you put in a word for me , maybe people would loosen up a little . Most of them , they do n't want to answer my questions at all . " <p> " We 're private folk , I told you that . " <p> " The questions are n't intrusive . How many people in your household , stuff like that , nothing personal at all . " He stepped closer , leaning toward me and lowering his voice . " And that 's not all . It 's the black people , especially . I saw them here and there today , but I never got a chance to ask them any questions . When I got here , I stepped back into the kitchen I 've just got a few questions , it would n't take a minute - and they would n't even acknowledge me . " <p> I stared at him for a moment , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have sent him packing right away , knowing too that that would n't have been a solution . There was no solution . Or there was one , and Stelly Broussard was right : I could n't stomach it . <p> " Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> " I 'll say a word to them , " I said . I turned to go , but he tugged at my shoulder . <p> His face was solemn . " This is a fascinating place , Mr. Decoteau . " <p> " How 's that ? " <p> " No cars , no power-lines , no televisions . Not even a radio . I have n't seen a radio all day . People act like they barely know what I 'm talking about . The ones who would even talk to me at all , that is , and not many of them did . " Dixon stared at the dance floor . Then he turned his gaze back to mine . " Do you think it 's because I 'm black , Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Well , I would n't either , but this place .... " <p> The music wound itself to a crescendo and died away amid scattered applause . In the silence , there was a metallic clatter in the kitchen . I felt the weight of the room 's attention swing past , two dozen pairs of eyes skating across my back without ever quite coming to rest . Ernest Fortier ran his bow across his strings , Louis counted out the time , " Un , deux , trois , " and the band swung into something new . <p> Dixon said , " I saw what looked like a little jail today , just one room in the woods behind your store . " <p> I stiffened . " Avery did n't take you down there , did he ? " <p> " No . Nor would he answer my questions when I asked about it . Why is that , Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> I felt a sick smile plaster itself across my face . " Well , we would n't want to expose you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would n't be hospitable , now would it ? " <p> " Maybe not , but it made me think , anyway . " <p> He had my attention now . " Think of what ? " <p> " Just how isolated you folks are . This place is like a whole different world . " Dixon licked his lips . " I hope you do n't take offense , Mr. Decoteau , but Sulphur Creek is a fine opportunity for field work . " <p> " Field work ? " <p> " Data gathering . Historical studies , anthropology , you name it . When I get back with the census data , you 're going to get some attention . I 've never heard of an entire town being forgotten like this . " He smiled , a chastened smile that reminded me somehow of Hiram , shyly inquiring about the possibility of another world . " But I 'm not fooling you , am I ? I guess you know I 'm really thinking in selfish terms . Of my dissertation . This place is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I felt stiff and cold suddenly , like it was mid-January and I 'd missed a step in the swamp , plunging deep into the dank chill waters of the Atchafalaya . His words buzzed around in my head like bees , alighting now and then to dip their stingers in my brain . I kept thinking of Hiram . Hiram and Billy Go and Odile Halloway . <p> " There 's some parts of history you do n't want to step into , " I said when I could get my works unfroze . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> I shook my head . " Forget it . I do n't mean nothin . Nothin at all . " <p> The words came out harsher than I 'd intended them , and something stirred in Lucas Dixon 's face , a kind of comprehension . I saw it happen . I saw his gaze slide away and come to rest at a point just over my left shoulder , a point where he could take in the room at a single glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black faces on the dance floor , of the way the ones who were there hugged the edges of the room , carrying drinks to the folks who sprawled across Ruby Lafitte 's sagging furniture . he stepped back , his face puzzled , and all at once it was too much for me , Lucas Dixon and Stelly Broussard and the ghost of my daddy always at my shoulder . The music buffeted me . My head throbbed . I needed to step back a minute , I needed a little time to regroup . <p> I lifted a hand . " There 's someone I need to see , " I said . " Just give me a minute , I 'll be right back . " <p> I turned away before he could answer , ducking into the kitchen . The heat from the stove enveloped me , sweltering , and the spicy fragrance of the gumbo grew abruptly stronger . My gut twisted . I propped myself against the wall , tipped my head back , and shut my eyes , waiting for the nausea to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured it in my head , the fan turning and turning in the dark above me , breathing winter down into my upturned face . I took a deep breath , felt the world settle into place around me . <p> I opened my eyes . The kitchen bustled with activity . Colored women worked at the counters or hurried back and forth through the door into the main room , their hands full . Hiram stirred a simmering pot of gumbo at the stove . A baby was crying in the adjoining parc aux petits . I glimpsed its nanny through the open door , cradling a squirming bundle against her bosom , her dark face gentle as she walked it patiently back and forth among the sleeping children . <p> A clatter drew my attention . Janie Halloway turned from capping a big pot of rice on the stove , and from the way her face wrinkled when she saw me , I knew Hiram had been carrying tales out of school . Normally , I 'd have scolded him , but I did n't have the heart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside my head with Lucas Dixon 's face , and for some reason I found myself thinking of the son I 'd never had , how disappointed my father would have been , and how he would have asked me who was going to take over the store when I was gone ? Who was going to make the runs to Morgan City then ? I did n't know , but I did n't care much either , so long as I never had to tell a son of mine that he 'd have to do things he did n't have the stomach for , because that was the price of being a man . <p> Janie Halloway stood before me , stout and tall , her broad face unlined even as she closed in on fifty . " He 's jest a boy , Mistah Armand , that 's all he ever was . " <p> " Janie , " I said . " You and I both know that Odile has to learn - " <p> " And if he do n't ? " She looked up , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do to Odile what you did to Billy , Mistah Armand ? Is that what you gon na do ? Cause I got to tell you , Mistah Armand , I could n't take it . I could n't take losin Odile , too . " <p> " Now , Janie - " I said , and then the tears welling up in her eyes spilled over , tracking slowly down her face . Just like that , I felt all the fight go out of me . I clasped her by the shoulders and tried to draw her close , but she stiffened , holding herself away , and the words came unbidden , rising to my lips the way words rise up when you cradle a weeping child , the way they surface out of some lost well of ages , these words of comfort that the first mother used maybe and which you too use , in this hour of need when only words can salve the ache inside you , though you 've never so much as held a child before . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na find us a way to take care of Odile . Ai n't nothin gon na happen to Odile . " <p> " You swear , Mistah Armand ? " <p> " I swear , " I said , and I felt it close around us , that promise , like a knot that 's been soaked in icy water , the fibers shrinking down and binding us together there in the stifling kitchen . I felt it close around us like a noose . I stood there a moment longer , gathering my strength , and then I released her . When I stepped back into the main room , Lucas Dixon was gone . <p> I PUSHED THROUGH the crowded dance floor to the door , the music dying into silence as people turned to stare after me . He was n't on the porch either . A sick premonition had seized me , and I stumbled down the steps toward the street , ignoring the confused snippets of talk <p> " - steady there , Armand - " <p> " - what 's the matter now - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was running , though I was far too old to run . An enormous swollen Moon had hove halfway above the horizon , pouring through the trees a deluge of orange light like the swamp itself had caught fire . The breeze-combed cypress and live oak screening the far end of town hurled down twisty spokes of shadow , and strange phantoms capered along the weed-clotted ruts of the street , as though a hellmouth itself had gaped open , releasing the souls of demons and sinners alike for a midnight frolic . My store loomed against the night sky , throwing its queer elongated shadow across the gleaming hulk of Dixon 's car . In the distance , on the other side of a patch of marshy scrub , I could glimpse the little bunker we used as a jail house . <p> By the time I saw the thing that tripped me up - Lucas Dixon 's leather satchel , spilling a sheaf of loose census forms into the street - it was too late . I went tumbling head over tea-kettle into the shadows by the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a thousand prickly fingers . As I stumbled to my knees , aching from the fall , the wind picked up , whipping Dixon 's papers into a narrow funnel . It held its shape for a split second before it came apart . One of the forms plastered itself flapping across my face , momentarily blinding me . Strong hands lifted me to my feet . The wind snatched the paper loose , whirling it away into the dark . <p> It was Billy Go that held my shoulders . Billy Go , a great hulking man with skin the color of night and handsome negroid features and big mournful eyes that held me fixed for a moment . Only his name was n't Billy Go , was it ? No , and it never had been , though we 'd all taken to calling him that these last few years , because Billy , he would n't stay . But the name he 'd been born to was Billy Halloway , and he had his mother 's eyes , and his mother 's round , smooth face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been his mother 's tears . He must have been thirty years old by then , but looking at him there , bare-torsoed in the moonlight with a pair of canvas trousers cinched around his waist , I saw only the boy I 'd known so many years ago , when he used to help out around the store , before all his troubles beset him , and Hiram came in to spell him for a while and somehow just never left . <p> " Billy , " I whispered . <p> " Mistah Armand , " he said . <p> In the silence , a group of boys emerged from the shadows . Odile Halloway stood in front , looking like a slimmed-down version of his older brother . The De Soto boys trailed along behind him : Marcus , a willowy young nigger who never said much , and Clifton , a rangy caramel-colored boy with one eye normal and the other like an island , stranded in a sea of purple birthmark that spilled out across one cheek to lap at the corner of his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Marcus and Clifton yanked him forward . <p> A savage anger boiled up inside me at the sight of him . " You just had to go off and have a look at the jail , did n't you ? " I snarled . " You and your damned questions , ca n't leave people well enough alone . " <p> " Now , hush up , Mistah Armand , " Billy said gently , drawing me closer , and he kind of winced when he did it . A scab cracked open under his arm , spilling a little rivulet of blood down his side , and Stelly 's words <p> - you let it be done , you did n't have the stomach to do it yourself- <p> - came back to me in a rush . A taste as bitter as day-old coffee grounds filled my mouth . I looked away , the anger sieving through me as suddenly as it had filled me up , leaving nothing behind but a sour residue of shame . <p> " You know how I always hated to see em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But they always end up hurtin me jest the same , do n't they ? I run off and you white mens fetch me back and there you stand noddin your head all mournful like and sayin I sure hate to see em hurt you , Billy , I surely do , but somehow it never make no difference in the end . " <p> " You stop runnin off , that 'd make a difference . You could have a good life here . Your mama has a good life . " <p> " My mama ai n't free , Mistah Armand . Ai n't none of us free . " <p> " That what you want , Billy , no matter what it takes ? " <p> " Thass right , Mistah Armand . No matter what it take . " <p> Odile stepped forward , then , laying a hand across Billy 's shoulder . Billy winced again , and when he winced , time slipped around me for a moment . I saw the lash spiral out against the morning sky , like a black snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the whipping post as it descended . I saw the blood , red as any white man 's blood . <p> " Time we be goin , Billy , " Odile said . " That strange nigger gon na drive us right on outta here . " He jerked his chin over his shoulder . Marcus and Clifton moved toward the car , leading the census taker between them . Odile 's gaze settled on my face . " We fixin to leave now , Mistah Armand , and you want to be real quiet . I would hate to have to hurt you , but I will do it . You make me , I will do it . You understand me ? " <p> His eyes were as cold and black as the eyes of a gar , and I saw that he meant it . I nodded . <p> " Billy , " Odile said . <p> Billy turned me loose , smoothing my shirt where he had gripped it . He held my gaze for the space of a heartbeat , letting me remember the polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , letting me see that nothing had happened to that boy despite all the scars men like Stelly Broussard had carved into his flesh since then . he was still right there , that boy , and I wondered that I had n't noticed him before , knowing with a kind of looming sickness that I had n't let myself . he nodded , and turned away . Odile stared at me a moment longer , his face expressionless , and then he followed his brother . <p> The other boys had slipped into the car by then , easing shut the doors as silently as ghosts . Lucas Dixon stared out at me through the driver 's side window , his face slack with shock . Odile and Billy Go were halfway to the car when it happened . " Start it up , now , " Odile hissed , and Dixon twisted the key . As the engine coughed to life , Booger tore out from under the porch , barking like his feet were on fire and his tail was catching . Odile lunged toward me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mistah A - " <p> He never finished the sentence . Instead a startled look stole across his moonlit features . He hung there , seeming to defy gravity for a moment , and then he pitched forward , thrashing like a man in a fit . In the same instant I heard the shot echoing away into the swamp . By the time it died , Odile Halloway had fallen still . <p> Billy Go sobbed and hunkered down beside his brother , his hands outstretched . <p> I twisted my head toward Ruby 's place . <p> The whole town had drifted into the street in my wake , black and white alike , sixty or seventy people I suppose there must have been . Stelly Broussard stood at their head , a dark shape , faceless , like a paper doll hewn out of night and propped up against the blood-red ovoid of that colossal Moon . As he lowered the rifle , a little ribbon of blue smoke curled away from the barrel . <p> " We thought he was goin for you , Armand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <p> After that , we just stood in silence because there was nothing else to say . The swamp rose up around us and drew us in , clamoring with noise and beauty and the ripe rich stink of death , and the world rolled on beyond it , worlds upon worlds , every one of them wheeling around on the axis of this moment . <p> Janie Halloway stumbled out of the crowd and went to her knees beside Billy Go , sobbing helplessly over his brother 's body . She cradled the dead boy 's head and lifted her face to the sky . " Odile ! " she screamed . " Odile ! " <p> Something twisted deep inside my guts . <p> And then the census taker 's automobile lurched into gear . <p> The engine shrieked as the car backed swiftly away , throwing up chunks of sod and wire grass . I caught a glimpse of the interior as it flew past . The two Sulphur Creek boys in the back seat stared out at me , their eyes wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never spared me a glance . His knuckles whitened as he fought the wildly spinning wheel . His face was a mask of shock and terror . <p> And then he was gone , whipping the car around backwards in a long arc , leaving me to stare after him through a cloud of exhaust . " Wait ! " I hollered , waving my arms , and for half a second , as I watched the car shudder to a halt , I thought he 'd heard me . I thought he was listening . Then lights flickered on the rear end and gears clashed . The car surged forward , weaving like a man with a skinful of liquor . Its headlights carved the dark as it picked up speed . I suppose Lucas Dixon must have seen it at the same time I did : the gravel road he had come in on was gone . <p> It had just flat disappeared . <p> The swamp surrounded us , closing the town in the way it always had . Water glimmered in the moonlight , and the cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . Lucas Dixon screamed . The car veered suddenly , the engine roaring . It went over the bank at full speed . Water foamed up around it like the froth on a bucket of fresh-churned milk . It had risen to the door handles by the time I drew close , the breath heaving in my lungs . <p> The back doors opened and the De Soto brothers came wading out , looking scared and remorseful . But Lucas Dixon never moved . He just sat there , staring out through the windshield , his hands still clenching the wheel . Even after I splashed out after him , he did n't look at me for a long time . He was sobbing quietly . Big fat tears rolled down his cheeks . His lips trembled as he turned his face to mine . <p> " Come on , now , " I said . " Do n't you fret . " <p> It took me a minute to pry the door open and haul him out , dead-weight . Mud sucked at my boots . My pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting on the shore like a man carved of ice . The moonlight shone on everything , gilding the leaves and the faces of the throng that stood behind him and the blued steel barrel of his rifle , which I 'd hauled back myself one night on the long , strange run from Morgan City . <p> " You let him go , he 'll bring folks back from outside , " Stelly said . " And then where we gon na be , Armand , you thought of that ? " <p> " And how they ever find their way ? The swamp , it 's always changing , you ca n't never come the same way twice . " <p> I started to shrug past him , but he stepped in front of me . He lifted the gun . I stared down into it , the machined bore spiraling down into a blackness just the color of death . <p> " You always find a way , do n't you ? " he said . " You let that boy go where he can talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They wo n't rest until they do , and you know it 's true , Armand , just like your daddy knowed it before you . " <p> " You gon na shoot me , Stelly ? " <p> He stared at me for a long time . Then I reached out and pushed the barrel of the rifle toward the ground . <p> " I 'm takin this boy out of here , " I said . <p> I gathered Lucas Dixon 's weight on my shoulder and started limping back toward town . The crowd parted before me silently , leaving a long path at my rear , and it was down that path that Stelly Broussard called out to me . <p> " What the hell am I supposed to do , Armand ? Why do n't you tell me that ? " <p> I did n't look back . <p> " You figure it out yourself , Stelly . You been doin all right so far . " <p> GOD HELP ME , I took him into the swamp . <p> I untied my daddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , same as my daddy had done with me , all those years before . just looking at him , hunkered shivering and silent in the bow , brought it all back , the night and the swamp and my daddy strong and silent in the stern . The deck groaned under a load of nutria and muskrat pelts for the Morgan City trade , and the dark sang out mysteriously around me . I was twelve years old , and as I watched the Moon rise orange and bloated through the cypress and tupelo-gum , my mind drifted to the stories I 'd heard at my nanny 's knee , tales of ha'nts and spirits , of the cursed souls called loup-gaious , and of the Alligator King , a hundred-foot behemoth that could rise unseen from his watery lair and reduce a pirogue to kindling with a single snap of his great jaws . An obscure terror seized me , and even now , all these years later , that terror has n't fully passed . <p> For the bayou is different in the night than it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the place grows stronger , a rank wild musk of vigor and decay , of yellow-blooming rushes and purple hyacinth and black mangrove striving up and dying back into the mire that nourished it . The night chorus begins to sing , frogs and lubbers and crickets , and occasionally you 'll catch a glimpse of the rarest creatures of the Atchafalaya - a bear or a bobcat or the great white flag of a snowy egret hurling itself into the velvet dark with a thunder of mighty wings . <p> Time slows and the night stretches out forever . The water never takes the same path twice , and your mind turns funny on you , and maybe it 's more than your mind . Maybe the whole world turns strange in the long black reach between midnight and dawn , when a stillness moves over the face of the waters and you hear the distant shriek of a loon , like a woman screaming , or the current parting as a gator glides from a rotten log to hunt the moonspun dark . <p> I was twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that my time too was drawing near . Knowing for the first time maybe how brief a life was , like a struck match flaring up for a fitful instant in the black well of eternity , and dying back in the same long breath of air . Knowing that my daddy would pass like his daddy had before him , and a time would come that it would fall to me and me alone , this long night passage to Morgan City . <p> Something huge lumbered off through the undergrowth , and a thin high cry drifted out of the void , a cry older than time . I lifted my face to the sky , and saw that we had left the world I 'd known behind . <p> Two Moons hung like Christmas bulbs in the endless deep , and a vast leathery shadow passed far overhead , cruising the night sky on enormous outstretched wings . Its great beak clacked open and once again that unearthly voice rang down the heavens . I felt the terror strong upon me then . I turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draped across my shoulders . " Where are we ? " I asked . <p> It was that same question that Lucas Dixon put to me now . His face was bleached out and he was shaking , the way a man does when the fever 's on him . I saw that he 'd been in a kind of shock for all this time , brooding on what he 'd seen , and now he 'd come to some resolve . He 'd decided to face the thing . I felt another little surge of respect for him , for the courage that had driven him suddenly to turn and face me there from the front of the boat . <p> " That road , " he said . " It just disappeared . " He shivered and stared off into the night for a while , and when he turned back to me , his face had a haunted , hunted look . " What kind of place is this , Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> I 'd spent years pondering that question . But it was my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only answer I could ever come to in all those sleepless nights . Swamp is older than any man , I said , and powerful , the most powerful place there is , maybe . It is sky and land , it is dry and wet , it is earth and air and water and a powerful strong hoodoo bound deep in the place where they all three come together . The swamp is many rivers , I said , all flowing and mingling together and changing , always changing . <p> My father believed the same was true of all times and all worlds and all places that have ever been or might be yet . There are many worlds , he told me , many lines of possibility , more than any man can comprehend maybe , and they mingle in the swamp like rivers , always flowing , always changing , with Sulphur Creek at the center , alone unchanged in all the years since the first Decoteau settled here , striding deliberately out of the same world that Lucas Dixon had stumbled out of , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It happens : some poor fool gets swept all unawares into a river of possibility and winds up in a place he could never imagine . And there are those few , the Decoteaus among them when our blood breeds true , who can sense those shifting currents of force in their bones , and navigate them . <p> " You took a wrong turn and drove down a road into the heart of everything , " I told him . " And when you went to drive back out again , that road was gone . The swamp had swallowed it up . You ca n't ever come the same way twice . " <p> Lucas Dixon stared up at me , his face washed clean with a wonder and terror so pure and dumb that I could hardly plumb it . Moonlight glinted in his spectacles , silvering over his eyes . " Am I lost forever then ? " <p> I did n't answer for a long time . I just stared down into his face , thinking of him in that first moment in my store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dumb luck that had brought him to my door . I do love history , Mz . Decoteau , he 'd said , and in that moment he 'd seemed so young , so fresh and overflowing with enthusiasm . It put me in mind of Hiram somehow , hungry for things he did n't even know were out there . My mind filled up with faces , with Odile Halloway and Billy Go and Stelly Broussard , his voice tightening like a drum as he said You let it be done , you did n't have the stomach to do it yourself . I thought of Janie Halloway , then , and the price you sometimes had to pay to be a man . <p> " Mr. Decoteau ? " <p> I felt my daddy 's presence at my shoulder . I thought I might weep . <p> " We 're all lost , " I said . <p> Dawn hung in the trees like gauze by the time I got back to Sulphur Creek , pushing my way steadily along the channel , feeling the ache of muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind my store . When I got close , he leaned out and hauled me in . He looped the stays around their posts and steadied the boat as I stepped out . <p> I brushed past him , moving toward the store . <p> He stopped me at the door . <p> " Armand , " he said . <p> I turned to look at him , thinking of the way this place had shaped us both over the long decades since we were boys . He was big and grizzled and there were crow 's feet around his eyes from staring long hours into the swamp and squinting at the Sun flashing off the water . It was like looking in a mirror . <p> " Armand , I just wanted - " he hesitated . " I just - " <p> " I know , " I said . I touched his shoulder and turned away . I went inside then , through the dark storage room and into the front , my feet finding the grooves laid down in the wood by all the Decoteaus who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted my face to the ceiling . The fan still turned patiently up there . I felt the cool air against my cheeks , gentle as a benediction . <p> Hiram woke me from a dream-haunted sleep when he came in after nine . " Miz Halloway been askin for you , " he told me . <p> " I reckon she has been , " I said . <p> I pushed myself wearily out of my seat . Booger looked up yawning from the porch , and I reached down to pat him before I started up the street . The Halloways lived in an old cabin behind Ruby 's place . The door opened as I mounted the steps . <p> Inside it smelled of flowers and the press of Negroes thronging the little room and the kerosene lanterns burning behind the closed shades . I heard the story from Janie Halloway herself , there in the crowded parlor : how she 'd run up to Ruby 's for some thread to mend Odile 's Sunday shirt , and how they 'd got to talking and crying as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last she 'd seen the chair overturned on the porch as she came through the trees . For a moment she had n't understood . It was nothing special , after all , just a plain old kitchen chair , but she could n't figure how it had come to be there , or why it filled her so with dread to see it lying on its side like that . And then she understood at last , and knowing already what Billy Go had done and why he had done it , she lifted her face to look at him , swinging slowly from the rafters . <p> She had laid them out in their finest things , both her boys . I stood looking down into Billy Go 's swollen face for a long time , thinking back on the days when he used to help out around the store . At last , I reached down and touched his cold hand with my own . Then I turned away , hoping that he 'd found some peace at last , now that he was finally free . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on the same as we 've always done here in Sulphur Creek , trapping and hunting and dancing on Saturday nights . Seven or eight times a year , I load up my daddy 's boat and set out for Morgan City , trading nutria and muskrat pelts for the few things we ca n't make on our own . <p> Most days I get through just fine without ever sparing the census taker a thought . Other days are harder , though , and on those days I walk out toward the edge of town where for the space of a single afternoon a gravel road found its way to the heart of everything , here in Sulphur Creek . <p> The car 's still there , sunk to its windows in water . I stand on the bank , staring out at it and thinking of Lucas Dixon and our night in the Atchafalaya and the price you have to pay to call yourself a man . The car 's seen better days . Great patches of rust have started eating away at the hood , and kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someday , I guess , it 'll disappear altogether . Daddy was right about that too , like he was right about so many things . Give it time enough , the swamp eats anything . Anything at all . <p> Author Affiliation
