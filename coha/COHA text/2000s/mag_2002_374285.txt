When WorldCom first owned up to its massive accounting fraud last summer , most observers of the once soaring telecom upstart figured its calls were numbered . Rivals like AT &T; and Sprint were happy to close the book on a company they blame as the principal culprit in the telecom bubble  --  one that had posted curiously high profits that they could never quite seem to match . But six months after its dirty little secret of success was exposed and the company was left for dead , WorldCom is confounding both its critics and its competition  --  not only refusing to die but showing some real , small signs of life . <P> WorldCom has undergone what court-appointed monitor and former SEC chairman Richard Breeden calls " a steam cleaning from top to bottom , " getting rid of virtually every member " of the gang that could n't shoot straight , " including practically the entire finance department . So far , at least , the nation 's second largest long-distance company has been able to hold on to the bulk of its big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exploring other options . It has also grabbed some local residential customers from the Baby Bells , reached a partial settlement with the SEC and built up a healthy cash reserve of close to $2 billion . Most important , it has lured former Compaq head and Hewlett-Packard president Michael Capellas to take on the reclamation project . <P> Capellas spent much of his first few weeks at the helm doing his best to convince WorldCom 's anxious customers and employees that the company , whose revenue has fallen an estimated 15% to 20% in the past year , wo n't be disconnected anytime soon . Now , with the prospect of a possible fine of up to $9 billion on the horizon , he has to craft a viable reorganization plan for the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history , involving $107 billion in assets . To generate real profit , he 'll have to consider unloading its shrinking paging business and handing out even more pink slips . He also wants to turn the company into ( do n't laugh ) a paragon of corporate governance  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new contract , worth about $6 million annually in cash and stock . That should be a little easier now that the seven board members left over from Bernie Ebbers ' free-spending days have just quit , leaving Capellas to handpick the majority of a new , more independent board . <P> Not surprisingly , WorldCom 's rivals , concerned that the company could emerge from bankruptcy with a clean , debt-free balance sheet and start another destructive price war , are n't so quick to forget the past . In recent months , they have been lobbying to have the company liquidated so the whole firm , not just a few top executives , ends up paying for its gross misconduct ; it does n't help matters that Ebbers , who may have to declare personal bankruptcy , still has n't been charged with anything .
