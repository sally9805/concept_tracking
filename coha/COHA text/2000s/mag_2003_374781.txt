No industrialist enjoyed upsetting the apple cart more than Henry Ford . In 1914 he announced that he would pay $5 a day to his workers , double the going rate . With the extra cash , Ford reasoned , they could purchase his Model Ts . The workers were becoming a bulwark of the middle class . <P> Ford 's next act came in September 1926 , when the company announced the five-day workweek . As he noted in his company 's Ford News in October , " Just as the eight-hour day opened our way to prosperity in America , so the five-day workweek will open our way to still greater prosperity ... It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either lost time or a class privilege . " The five-day week , he figured , would encourage industrial workers to vacation and shop on Saturday . Before long , manufacturers all over the world followed his lead . " People who have more leisure must have more clothes , " he argued . " They eat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles . " Taking advantage of his own wisdom , he discontinued the Model T and then , on a Saturday , launched the Model A. The 1927 unveiling would see 10,534,992 people visiting dealerships just to glimpse the latest product of the Sage of Dearborn.  --  By Douglas Brinkley , a history professor at the University of New Orleans .
