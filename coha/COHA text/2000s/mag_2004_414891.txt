What 's this talk show host like off the air ? Here 's a peek at her baby plans , her husband 's hidden talent , and other secrets too racy for daytime TV. // PHOTOGRAPHED BY JACK GUY 10 A.M. : Live with Regis and Kelly is finished filming for the day . Back in her dressing room , Kelly removes her makeup , changes into cropped pants and a top with " Sugar Mama " across the front , and indulges in her own morning TV fix : ferry Springer . " Look , there 's a fight ! " Kelly says excitedly as she wolfs clown a sandwich . Even though she 's kicking back , she 's as bubbly as ever . " I have a disclosure complex , " she admits . " I ramble like a babbling brook , a river with no beginning and no end . " It 's hard to imagine that just three years ago , when she first made the leap from being an All My Children soap star to a morning talk show host , Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off the air . Now , Kelly considers Live her second home . " I do n't feel like I 'm on a show . I just feel like I 'm in our place where we have our coffee , " says the 33-year-old . And yet in spite of her star quality-which also landed her a role on the ABC hit Hope &; Faith-Kelly does have a shy side . " I rarely go to events , and always feel so out of place at them , " she says . " I 'm always starstruck and over in the corner thinking my dress is n't smart enough . So I just take myself out of it . I 'm like , Tm taking my hall and going home . ' ' " In truth , this talk show host is happiest hanging in her New York apartment with her three children , Michael , Lola , and Joaquin . She also makessure she gets plenty of alone-time with her husband of eight years ( and former AMC co-star ) , Mark Consuelos , who to Kelly 's surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete with massage appointments , dinner reservations , and a dress he picked out for the occasion . What other aspects of her life has Kelly kept well under wraps until now ? We asked , and , boy , did she answer . BEHIND THE SCENES OF LIVE On Live with Regis and Kelly , you said you 've " lost it " in front of many stars you admire . Whom did you love meeting most ? Probably Madonna . And I love Nicole Kidman . She 's funny and charming and probably the most beautiful person on the planet . Her skin has no flaws at all-not a pore , a freckle , a line . It 's a whole other level of skin quality . How about the least ? As if I 'm dumb enough to answer that question ! Well , then , what was your most embarrassing moment of no-holds-barred celebrity worship ? There 's one every day . Once I said to a movie star-I 'm not going to say whom- " You 're perfect in every way . " Off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this makes hissing noises , mocking me . One of my producers once held up a card that said , " Stop with the gushing . " Did you ever regret anything vou 've said to them ? Every day ! My vision is poor , so when there are questions on the cue cards , I 'm looking with my one good eye , thinking , What does that say ? Glenn Close was on the show for The Stepford Wives , and the cue card said she plays the queen of Stepford . But I could n't really read it , so I said , " So you 're the queen of Manhattan ? " She looked at me like , " What are you talking about ? " And I look at it again , and say , " So you 're the queen of the East Coast ? " And she 's like , " Uh , no . " And you think , Ca n't we just erase time and start this over again ? Do you hate being described as perky ? No . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f am perky , I 'm on fire . I have a lot of energy , I do n't require a lot of sleep , and it takes a lot to get me in a bad mood . So if I 'm perky , I 'm perky . I do n't consider it a bad thing . If they were calling me foul-tempered , then I might go , " Well , that 's getting personal . " So when , if ever , are you laid-back ? Rarely do I speak after 11 a.m . Eventually I crash from the coffee and go back to being just normal . Usually when Michael is in school and the two little ones are napping , I put on Court TV , and for an hour and a half , I go into a coma . How do you and Regis get along ? In the beginning , I was really nervous to work with him , because I thought , If I take his show off the air after all these years , I 'm going down . I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he 's not here , boy , do I feel it . He always likes to say , " Oh , you do n't miss me . " But I really miss him . Because I feel like he does most of the work , and I just get to ride on his coaltails . WHAT SHE LOVES ( AND DOES N'T LOVE ) ABOUT HER LOOKS If you could change one thing about your appearance , what would it be ? I would probably make my upper arms less matronly . I was caught on Entertainment Tonight or something a few years ago at the Emmys , and they were showing Mark and me walking in slow motion , and I was waving , and it was like , w ho o s h , w h o o s h . You 'll never see me wave like that again . You said recently that you would probably have Botox . Is this true ? Sure I would . I mean , not light now , but someday I will need it right there points to forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . What 's your stand on cosmetic surgery ? Here 's the thing : I do n't really want to fall asleep . I 'd rather have topical things . But who knows ? Right now , I do n't really feel the need to mess around with unnecessary procedures . But do n't get me wrong : Once stuff starts to disintegrate , I 'm going to fix it . I 've heard that you never diet . Is this true ? I do n't diet , but I do n't overeat . I like cheese , I eat cheese . 1 like French fries , I eat French fries . Do I order a Big Mac and supersize my fries every day ? Of course not . I eat when I 'm hungry , like they say you should . If I fell like I could n't button my pants , I would probably not eat so much cheese , or go for a walk . I say I do n't exercise , but really , pushing two kids in a double stroller and having my son riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park and back , I really am exercising . I 'm not squatting or hinging or lifting things-I 'm lifting children . When you were pregnant on Live , you got some harsh letters from viewers criticizing your appearance . Tell us about them . I got letters about my belly button . I have an outie to begin with , and when I 'm pregnant , I 'm a mega-outie . I was like , " I do n't understand what you want me to do about it . " My feelings were hurt , and it 's not something I could help . I would put nipple tape on my belly burton and I 'd still get complaints . But then you realize , these are very bored people who need to volunteer somewhere to get that pent-up energy off their hands . What do you have in your purse right now ? Let 's see . I have my padded bra . I have this great lip gloss called Fat Kiss , my iPod , I have this makeup case dumps it out . Look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the Disney jet , and they have all these little sample medications , and I cleaned them out and put them in here . They 'll probably never invite me back . HER PRIVATE WISH FOR HER FAMILY Do you ever worry your career will Fizzle , and what would you do if it did ? I would be a full-time mom . I 've always prepared for the end , because this stuff comes and goes , and if you put your whole life in it , you 're setting yourself up for a rude awakening . When you work for Disney , for instance , you get taken around Disney World so you do n't have to wait in line . But one day , that wo n't happen . And what am I going to have ? Impatient kids ? I think it 's good for them to wait in line . It teaches them how life is . I do n't want them to think , " Where 's the man who takes us to the front of the line ? " Plan on having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days old , people would say , " So , when are you going to try for a fourth ? " And I 'd say , " Are you kidding ? Let me grow attached to this one first . " I 'm not trying now , and do n't think we will . We are so in over our heads , I just feel like if we had one more , somebody would probably get hurt . The only reason I would want a fourth kid is that I hate triangulation . I always feel like there 's an odd-manout aspect to three kids . Have you and Mark always agreed on the number ? Mark wanted to have two kids , and I wanted four , so three seemed like a nice compromise . What 's been the most challenging aspect of your life in the past year or so ? Trying to wash all of the parts of my body in the same shower . With three kids-well , it 's really just two since Michael 's 7 and I do n't have to worry about him choking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the shower with me , then anything could happen . Usually when I shower , I can either wash my hair or my body . Nothing ever gets washed at the same time . THE MARRIAGE MOMENTS NO ONE SEES You 've shared a lot about your private life on Live . Has Mark established anything as off-limits ? I think early on , he had some hope that I would use discretion-then he threw that out the window . It 's funny because Mark really is so private , and I will tell anybody anything . He 's like , " What 's the matter with yon ? Three minutes you know this person , you gave her our home phone number ? Are you insane ? " We 're very opposite in that way . He knows when to keep quiet and when to speak , and I 'm a yappy Chihuahua . Given how your career 's taken off , do you think it 's ever hard for Mark to fee ! he 's keeping up ? No . Mark is a very proud man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been about me making him feel good about himself . He knows who he is , and he knows what he has to offer . Does having three kids and busy careers put a damper on your sex life ? Let 's just put it this way : When there 's a will , there 's a way . And there 's a lot of will in our relationship . Have you seen my husband ? All I have to do is look at him and it 's like , " Okeydoke ! " He 's so beautiful and breathtaking . The mold was broken with him , and there 's not a day that goes by that I do n't feel like the luckiest woman on the planet . Which physical feature do you appreciate the most ? I love the structure of his face . I love his eyes the most-his eyes and eyelashes are amazing . And his lips are not to be believed . And his teeth will blind you because they 're so white . And his hands ... I wish he was here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband has the most beautiful hands . But it 's more than just his looks . Hc speaks Italian , and he 's very sexy , he has nice clothes , and he appreciates art . There 's a lot to him . He always surprises me in little ways . What 's the most romantic surorise vou 've received ? Once for my birthday , he kidnapped me and flew me on a private plane to Montreal , where he had massages set up , and then dinner , and then dancing , and then we Hew home . And I was dressed like this looks down , and I said , " I ca n't go to dinner in this . " He said , " I got you a dress . " I told him I felt like Pretty Woman . Except I 'm not a hooker . Every year for our wedding anniversary , we go to Montreal for the weekend . We stay in bed all morning , and-this only means something to other parents-we read the paper from cover to cover . People without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . You do n't get to read the paper much ! It 's like , " I did n't know that George H. Bush 's son was President ! When did this happen ? " When 's the last time you two had a night out ? We went to the Gansevoort hotel in NYK , which had just opened , and to a nightclub across the street . We had a great time , we were dancing , we had champagne . And we came back and were preparing for our big romantic night , but it was a soft opening of the hotel , so there were no curtains . And I 'm thinking , " With our luck , we 'll get our pictures taken . " So we were crawling around on the floor . Hey , we have three kids . We 'll Rnd a way .

I feel like the luckiest woman on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
