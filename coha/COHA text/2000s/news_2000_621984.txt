<p> A new fitness technique is being embraced by health clubs and medical research as a revolutionary way to lose weight and get in shape . It goes like this : <p> 1 . Sit down in front of computer . <p> 2 . Place right hand on mouse and click . <p> 3 . Repeat . <p> That 's right , Web entrepreneurs are trying to accomplish what the $16 billion fitness industry has so far failed at : Getting pudgy , sedentary Americans @x shape . The Department of Health and Human Services reports that 35 percent of Americans are overweight . <p> GetFit.com , eFit.com and Asimba.com are a few of the sites that have mobilized athletes , dietitians , professional coaches and doctors to create smart , Web-based applications that act like personal trainers . The American Heart Association is putting together a not-for-profit version of the same idea at www.justmove.org . <p> Available free online , the applications use an individual 's fitness goals and exercise preferences to develop a personalized fitness and diet program . As they follow the program , users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site , and then they can view their progress over time on charts and graphs . <p> At least one site , Redwood City 's Asimba , can be used on a Palm or other handheld device , so users can record their miles or calories while they 're still at the gym or McDonald 's . <p> Other sites offer encouragement in the form of e-mail reminders , online support groups and calorie calculators . <p> Some sites plan to provide exercis- ers with feedback as they pursue their goals , either through artificial intelligence or from staff trainers . If after 10 weeks your goal of adding an inch to each bicep has eluded you , the site may suggest that you increase your intake of protein or rest for a shorter time between weightlifting sets . <p> " Our biz model is predicated on a paradox , " said Asimba chief executive Kurt Schneider . " We 're using a sedentary medium to motivate you to get off your keister . " <p> But while Internet use is often blamed for expanding waistlines and rear ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet-based programs can be effective in helping people lose weight . The ongoing study shows that dieters who interact with a Web site by reporting what they eat and by getting advice from professionals via e-mail lose an average of 9 pounds in 12 weeks . <p> Another group , which had access to weight-loss advice on a Web site but did n't receive e-mail reminders or participate in other interactive activities , lost only about 3 pounds during the study . <p> Marcie Kay , a Palo Alto mother , became a beta tester for GetFit.com 's still-unreleased personal training program to help her take off a few pounds after giving birth to her second child . She says she wants to be in good condition because she hopes to have a third child soon . <p> She filled out a GetFit.com questionnaire , informing the site that she has access to a swimming pool , a health club and a treadmill , and that she enjoys running . She set the goals of losing 5 to 10 pounds and improving her muscle tone . <p> The site gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treadmill and included workouts with free weights and the StairMaster exercise machine . If she does n't know how to do an exercise she is assigned , she watches animated instructions that the Web site provides . <p> Kay has worked with a personal trainer before , but she prefers using the Web page for a reason many casual exercisers cite : " I do n't like people watching me exercise . " <p> Like others who are attracted to the online fitness model , Kay also says she 's too busy to schedule appointments with trainers . Another major draw is that most fitness Web sites offer their services for free , while personal trainers charge about $60 per hour . <p> Instead of worrying that sites like GetFit.com will steal their customers , health clubs hope that many users of these sites will , like Kay , print out workout recommendations and take them to the gym . In fact , the International Health , Racquet and Sportsclub Association is devoting its annual conference , held at the Moscone Center next week , to the impact of the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships with Web sites . Members of several hundred clubs nationwide , including YMCAs , can record their miles run or pounds lifted on kiosks powered by a site called FitLinxx.com . <p> Logging pounds lifted on a computer instead of on paper makes it easier to visualize how much you 've accomplished : FitLinxx tells you how many sports cars you could have lifted this month and how many ice cream cones worth of calories you 've burned . <p> Personal trainers use the system to review their clients ' progress and communicate with them via e-mail , increasing the amount of contact between scheduled meetings . Clients who are n't working with a trainer can use FitLinxx to create personalized workouts much like the other fitness sites provide . <p> Asimba partnered with Crunch , a nationwide club chain , on a program called Millennium Challenge , which encouraged participants to meet their fitness goals by letting them compete against others and by sending them daily e-mail reminders to work out . Crunch 's staff promoted the challenge to club members . <p> Asimba CEO Schneider said the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet terminals on treadmills and other exercise machines in gyms , so members ' progress could be recorded automatically . One company , NetPulse , already provides gyms with Internet/television terminals that attach to exercise machines , which members can use to log their progress . <p> For people who work out at home , the world 's largest manufacturer of exercise machines , Icon Health &; Fitness , has created its own Web site , called iFit.com . Icon 's new Internet-ready treadmills , stationary bikes and other machines , priced between $600 and $1,400 , can be connected to a home computer . While on the treadmill , the user might see a virtual course of rolling hills on the computer monitor . At the same time , the treadmill tilts to simulate running uphill . <p> With a Web cam , exercisers can also enter a live teleconference with a personal trainer for an hourly rate . <p> Icon is working on technology that will enable users to race one another on virtual tracks , just as video game players zap each other in online games . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through these large commercial sites or on their own . By pursuing Internet clients , a trainer can see more people and earn more money . But some trainers worry that eliminating face-to-face meetings could be counterproductive and even dangerous . <p> Susy Jones , who coaches athletes preparing for triathlons in San Francisco , says she experimented briefly with online training but abandoned it because she could n't be sure that her clients were exercising properly . <p> " The first time I trained someone over the Internet , I put a 15-minute warm-up in the program . They skipped it and they pulled a calf muscle the first time out , " she said . <p> Most fitness sites sidestep the safety issue by advising that exercisers meet with their doctor or a trainer before starting a program . And they require users to indicate that they understand that exercise involves risk before they can register . <p> Jim Sullivan , a former Stanford athletic coach who now works for GetFit.com , acknowledged that having in-person training would be best . <p> " In the ideal scenario , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , trainer , dietitian , etc. , " Sullivan said . " Can you afford to have a professional staff of seven or eight people to take care of you every day ? " <p> CHART : <p> SET YOUR SITE <p> Several fitness sites offer a virtual trainer and diet coach that uses your goals and preferences to generate an exercise and diet program just for you . Here are the results these sites produced when told that the user was female , owned a jump rope and in-line skates , and wanted to lose 15 pounds : <p> . <p> Site : eFit.com <p> Recommended program : 1,200-calorie-a-day menu plus jumping rope and push-ups <p> Drawback : Did n't say how long to exercise <p> Other features : Send in your photo and they 'll show you what you 'd look like 20 pounds thinner <p> . <p> Site : Asimba <p> Recommended program : 1,600-calorie-a-day menu plus 40 minutes of in-line skating <p> Drawback : Chili for dinner three nights in one week <p> Other features : Update fitness log or read program instructions on a Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Recommended program : Intense cardio workout for 20 to 60 minutes , three times a week <p> Drawback : No diet recommendation <p> Other features : Has kiosks in health clubs where members can log their workouts <p> . <p> Source : Chronicle research <p> MORE FITNESS SITES TO CHECK <p> . <p> Site : iFit.com <p> Launch date : Available now <p> Description : Sells exercise machines that connect to the Net via a PC for virtual workouts <p> Something to try : Race other users online <p> . <p> Site : American Heart Association Fitness Center ( www.justmove.org ) <p> Launch date : Available now <p> Description : Tracks activity with an exercise diary , offers news and forums <p> Something to try : Compare your fitness with others in a nationwide database <p> . <p> Site : GetFit.com <p> Launch date : May 1 <p> Description : Creates personalized workouts developed by artificial intelligence <p> Something to try : See a new exercise demonstrated in 3-D from any angle <p> . <p> Site : FitCare.com <p> Launch date : March 22 <p> Description : Provides written and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their area <p> Something to try : Take an online course to become a certified fitness trainer <p> . <p> Site : Workout.com <p> Launch date : Available now <p> Description : Provides selection of hundreds of standardized exercise programs and demonstrates exercises with photos <p> Something to try : Look up terms in a fitness encyclopedia <p> . <p> Site : FitForAll.com <p> Launch date : End of March <p> Description : Offers standardized workouts with video demonstrations , plans to debut personalized workouts and diets <p> Something to try : E-mail a question to the staff dietitian <p> . <p> Source : Chronicle research <p> E-mail Carrie Kirby at ckirbysfgate.com.
