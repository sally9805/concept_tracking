KATE ROSEN SAT ON THE EDGE of the stage , the large hotel ballroom stretching beyond her , long emptied of people . The only things left behind were the detritus of a grand night of celebration-balloons skimming over the carpet , trampled paper streamers , discarded signs , and swags of limp bunting that sagged against the walls . <p> No more cameras , no strobe lights , no cheering throng . <p> The exuberant but exhausted audience had finally faded away hours earlier , the journalists following suit shortly afterward . America had finally gone to bed , either celebrating or lamenting the fact that that they 'd just elected their first female president . <p> Kate cherished the silence . She needed someplace where she could collect her thoughts , which had been shattered tonight . She 'd discovered things she could hardly believe even still about her best friend . And she 'd been disillusioned in a way that nobody , even a politician 's top aide , was prepared to be . Her headache and heartache had been made worse by the oppressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her entourage , minus Kate , went upstairs , the party had finally broken up and the ballroom 's capacity crowd started to stream home for their own private celebrations . <p> But Kate 's ears still rang with the sound of more than a thousand people cheering , screaming their support of their candidate . <p> " Benton ! Benton ! Benton ! " <p> Emily Rousseau Benton , former governor of Virginia , Kate 's best friend , had been elected president of the United States , in no small part due to Kate 's hard work . Emily 's race for the White House had dominated both of their lives for the past four years . Everything Kate did , every action she took as Emily 's campaign manager , had been done solely in support of her friend 's bid for the presidency . <p> And now that Emily had won , Kate was alone , horrified at the prospect that she might have made a terrible mistake . <p> She slipped down from the stage riser and kicked idly at the balloons in her path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . An occasional balloon still floated down from the ceiling , a day late and a dollar short . <p> Kate 's most recent revelation had been like that , one day too late .... <p> " Hey , Kate . " <p> A lone voice penetrated the silence . She stiffened in surprise and raised her hand to shade her eyes and get a better look at the person standing on the balcony . Her mood lightened and her shoulders relaxed when she realized who had spoken . <p> " Hey , Wes . " <p> " Y'all all right ? Need some company ? " <p> She nodded . <p> It was a classic Southern salutation , and the familiarity of it was oddly comforting . Then again , Wes Kingsbury always knew what to say-he was equal parts her friend and her spiritual mentor . Disappearing into the shadows , Wes emerged a few moments later from the staircase leading to the balcony box . <p> Kate glanced at her watch and stifled a yawn-3:46 . That was a.m . Too early to be called morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hours of the human soul , when body rhythm and spirit were at their lowest point . <p> " I ca n't believe you 're still here , " she said . The man had a wife and a small child , a real world and home to which he could return . He had n't closed his life down to a single obsessively sought goal . That had been her mistake . <p> " And I ca n't believe you 're not upstairs . M 's still up in the suite , partying hearty . " <p> She kicked at a balloon , stirring up a small whirl of color . " I know . I 'm not in much of a party mood . " <p> " So I see . " He fell into step next to her . " What 's going on ? I would have thought you 'd be thrilled . This was the goal , right ? " He pointed to an abandoned placard : Benton/ Bochner ' 08 . <p> " It was . It is . " She could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Emily . It 's always complicated . " He chuckled , then sighed . " Okay , what has she done now ? " At Kate 's hesitation , he added , " It 's got something to do with Talbot , does n't it ? " <p> Charles Talbot had been Emily 's opponent in her race for the White House . As such , he 'd pulled out all the stops to find all the dirt he could on his challenger . Kate , as Emily 's friend and ally for more than twenty years , had been positive there was no dirt to be found . <p> She 'd been so wrong .... <p> Talbot 's investigators discovered that Emily 's family had illegally won important highway construction contracts in Virginia while Emily was the state 's governor . <p> When Kate learned his camp was prepared to release this information , the only way she could stop him was to explain to him exactly the unsavory facts that her own investigations had uncovered on him-details she 'd kept out of Emily 's hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike an ill-timed and unnecessary first blow-using a nuke when a nudge would have worked just as well . She 'd learned the hard way that Emily , though a talented politician , was n't exactly good at being subtle when she had a bigger weapon handy . But when Talbot made his big , bold move to not only discredit Emily but take down her family by attempting to dismantle the entire Benton legacy , Kate had intervened by threatening to use her opposition research . <p> Talbot had killed ... and Kate felt that she had no choice but to remind him of the lengths to which he 'd gone to cover up his own crimes . She had the bloody proof that he 'd been criminally negligent , if not morally responsible , in the grisly death of his college girlfriend . Talbot might have maneuvered his way out of the scandal , but Kate had the goods on him-incontrovertible evidence . <p> If released to the public , her evidence would have been sufficient to end his campaign , destroy his reputation , and possibly land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talbot saw the light and backed down from his threats . <p> So Talbot had been stopped . The situation had served to cement Kate 's resolve that Emily Benton would make a far better president than her opponent . Emily was a policy wonk who knew her stuff , she was talented at getting things done , she worked hard for the people she represented , and she was charismatic enough to persuade even those who opposed her to allow time for her ideas to have a chance to work . In other words , Emily was the best politician of her time . <p> However , Kate soon learned not only that her actions had made Talbot her enemy for life , but also that no one ever wins in a competition of " who has the best blackmail " because the games like that never end . She 'd felt sickened , soiled , and finally betrayed . <p> Kate drew a deep breath . " Emily found out . " <p> Wes straightened for a moment . He 'd been one of only two confidants who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . <p> " About ... " Wes paused and glanced around as if gauging the likelihood of being overheard . Even though no one was in sight , he kept his voice low . " About the ammunition you had ? How ? " <p> " I told her I 'd stopped Talbot , but I refused to tell her how . I did n't think she needed to know . So in the middle of the night , my best friend M sent one of her protTgTes to ' borrow ' the report from me . " <p> " ' ProtTgTes ' ? " Wes 's gaze narrowed . " Maia , " he said in a flat voice . <p> Kate nodded . " Our very own iron ingenue in training . " She stared across the vast ballroom , watching a piece of bunting as it slipped from the balcony railing and wafted gently to the floor . " Though apparently she 's more iron maiden than ingenue . Scruples do n't seem to concern her . I rip my heart out every day , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my country and to my friends-especially Emily . I want to make a difference in the world , make people 's lives better . I do n't always like how I do it . Yet Maia did n't have a second thought when Emily asked her to steal the reports from me in the middle of the night . She made copies , then replaced the originals so I would n't know . Then Emily had Maia contact Talbot with what you 'd call a very thinly veiled threat . " <p> Wes read between the lines . " Destroying any hope of the campaign staying out of the gutter . " <p> " Yeah . But then came the weird part . It did-stay out of the gutter , I mean . " A shiver coursed up her spine and she crossed her arms in an effort to combat it . " Buttoned up tighter than Fort Knox . Maybe my way was n't effective enough . Maybe Emily 's decision to send him a second threat was the only real way to stop him . " A second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't because she was cold . " Maybe I was wrong . Or maybe I 'm in the wrong business . Or maybe I 'm simply overreacting . " <p> " Or maybe not . " <p> They took several more steps through the remains of the revelry before Kate stopped . She reached down and rescued a placard bearing Emily 's likeness . <p> " In any case , I do n't know ... " She hated how her voice broke when she spoke . " I do n't know if I can stay . If I can continue working with her . She lied to me , stole from me . Maia actually expected me to be impressed by their cleverness . Emily knew better . But she set it up anyway . " She studied the picture plastered across the placard . Emily 's resolute smile looked effortless despite the fact it 'd taken the photographer over two hours to capture the perfect expression . <p> " You have very high standards for your behavior . " Wes took a few more steps , then stopped , pivoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Emily 's a lot more flexible ; she 's a big proponent for ' the end justifies the means . ' You know that . I know that . The question is , can you tolerate that ? Jesus himself said , ' Render unto Caesar that which was Caesar 's . ' But there have to be consequences when a person crosses the line . Nobody 's above the law , not even Emily-though she 'd probably argue that point . The big question you have to answer here is what is the right thing for your faith and the right thing for the world . Think hard about that and then move forward . I 'll pray for you . I know it 's going to be a tough decision . " <p> Kate looked up from Emily 's compelling expression , the look in her eyes that said , You know you can trust me . " A decision I was hoping you 'd help me make . " <p> To her utter surprise , Wes shook his head . " Nope . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hear me out . I 'm always willing to offer advice , lend a hand or even a shoulder , but when it comes to something like this , you need to work with a higher authority . " He pointed upward . <p> Kate managed to conjure up a tight smile . " Somehow , I do n't think you mean President-Elect Benton in the penthouse suite . " <p> " Nope . A lot higher . " <p> * * * <p> They rode up the elevator in silence . It was n't until they reached the door to the suite , flanked by Secret Service agents , that Wes hesitated . <p> Kate fought the urge to say , " You 're going in with me , are n't you ? " She realized she needed to speak to Emily in private . If any of the campaign entourage still hung about , Kate would have to bide her time , smile , make nice with the natives , and wait for her chance after all the hoopla finally ended . It had been relatively easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the attention of the next president would be more complicated . <p> She practiced her smile on the two agents , whose names she needed to learn . Then she stopped herself . <p> Or maybe after tonight it would n't matter . <p> " This is where I say good-bye . " Wes leaned over and kissed her forehead . " And good luck . Let me know what happens . " <p> " Thanks . I will , " she whispered . Drawing in a deep breath , Kate reached for the doorknob , but the agent on the right beat her to it . <p> " Allow me , Ms. Rosen . " He opened the door . <p> It was a testament to the construction of the hotel that she heard little in the way of sound from the suite until the door opened . Then a cacophony of laughter and voices met her , the celebration evidently still in full swing . The crowd had dwindled some , but an impressive number of folks still lingered , including several of Washington 's biggest power players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Benton family members , and some of the key campaign staffers . <p> Kate did n't see Emily at first but finally spotted her in a corner of the room , holding court . They made eye contact and Emily raised her hand as if saying , Over here and motioned Kate over . In response , Kate began to pick her way through the clusters of people . She was stopped every foot or so to be congratulated , hugged , and offered a drink . <p> She felt odd accepting the accolades , but she had no trouble waving off the libations . The last thing she needed was the muddle of alcohol . She could only hope that Emily had kept a clear head as well . <p> Before Kate could reach Emily 's position , she bumped into a rather solid male form . Before she could recover her balance , a hand grasped her elbow and she was hit in the face with a cloud of whiskey breath . <p> " Katie-girl ! " Emily 's old family adviser Dozier Marsh pulled her into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sainted grandfather , but it was as far from what he really was as the North Pole from Antarctica . He was the ultimate political fixer-a devious , dangerous old power broker with a fondness for hard liquor and Emily , though not always in that order . And right now , he was acting like a lecherous uncle . <p> Great-uncle . " Where you been , darlin ' ? " he wheezed . " Hard to have a party without Emily 's right-hand gal ! " He tried to swing her around . The move would have made them both fall over had the young aide standing next to him not reached up and steadied him . <p> " Sir , perhaps you 'd rather sit , " the aide said . <p> Dozier gave Kate a grin and leaned heavily against his aide . " I suspect you 're right , Percy . The room is definitely leaning to one side . " He dropped heavily into the nearest chair , managing to spill two drinks that were abandoned on the nearby end table . He stared blearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kate , and get me a couple of cocktail napkins so I can clean up behind my sorry , drunken self ? I 'd ask Perry here , but he 's playing a key role in supporting me . " <p> " Now , Dozier ... " Emily 's voice knifed neatly through the chatter , instantly commanding the attention of the room . " You 're not asking the future White House chief of staff to be your fetch-it girl , are you ? " <p> Dozier 's ruddy complexion deepened . " Of c-course not , Emily .... I mean ... " He pulled awkwardly to his feet , away from his aide , and managed a small stiff bow without falling over . " Madam President . " <p> The room went silent , no one quite sure what direction Emily 's response might head next . <p> " I 've never really liked being called ' madam . ' " After a tense millisecond , Emily allowed a smile to spread across her face . " But I guess I 'll get used to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freed from the sharp conversational hook on which he 'd impaled himself , offered a weaker version of her smile and lifted the drink he 'd never lost grip of . " Hear , hear . " <p> With the momentary tension broken , the room went back to its earlier state-celebrating people clustering in small discussion knots . Dozier 's aide , a young man whose name was neither Percy nor Perry but Zack , distracted Dozier with something shiny , giving Kate a chance to escape . Once again , Emily gestured for Kate to follow her and led to the bedroom portion of the suite . <p> Once the door was closed behind them , Emily gave her a warm hug . " I was starting to get worried about you . " She gave Kate a close scrutiny . " Honey , you look like the weight of the free world is still on your shoulders . But the campaign 's over . We won . You can afford to relax now . " <p> " No . I ca n't . " Kate said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontrolled and bitter . She wanted to be completely in control of her emotions before she confronted Emily . <p> Emily sighed , obviously ignorant of the battle brewing inside Kate . " I know . I feel the same way . Campaigning is hard work , but nothing compared to running a country . " She dropped to the bed . " If I allowed myself a chance to stop and think about what I 'm taking on , I 'd probably run out of this hotel screaming like the Madwoman of Chaillot . <p> " Remember when we went to New York on spring break back when we were in school ? How we jumped on our beds at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel and had a pillow fight ? Mom was horrified , but Dad told me that he hoped I 'd never get too old to bounce on the bed . " <p> " Yeah , " Kate said . Decades of memories came crashing down upon her . Room service , going to plays , Emily 's genuine pleasure at sharing the treat with her friend . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed " had become an inside joke , a motto for that trip and later , the watchwords for those times when the responsibilities of law school-and beyond-threatened to drag them down . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
