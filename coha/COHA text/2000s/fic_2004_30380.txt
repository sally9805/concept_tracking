Chapter One The dance floor was crowded with tuxedos and sparkling evening gowns , creating a breathing , living organism of excitement ; it was New Year 's Eve at the large corporate building that housed Whittaker Industries , and the collective ensemble glittered like a bevy of Christmas gifts waiting to be handed out . Leaning against the rail of a balcony overlooking the party was a stunningly beautiful woman , Elizabeth Whittaker , who wore a seductive black evening gown . A hint of a smile adorned her face as she felt the enthusiasm and energy generated from the people down below . A man in a tuxedo inched close behind her . " Dance with me , " he commanded , putting a hand on her arm . She moved slightly away , her eyebrows rising disdainfully . " I 'll have you know , I 'm a married woman . " His smile deepened . " Believe me , I love married women , " he assured her , " especially- " Her interruption was curt . " I 'm sure you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangling , thinking you have eyes only for them . " " No " - he held up a hand- " I was only going to say that I especially love ... " He looked hard at her . She waited , watching him before she finally prompted impatiently , " And what do you especially love ? " " Not what , who , " he corrected . Her eyes narrowed as she drummed herfingers against the top of the rail . Finally , she sighed . " And whom do you especially love ? " " The woman I 'm married to , " he murmured , seeing a reluctant smile start to glimmer in her eyes . He leaned closer , but she twisted away so she could look straight at him for a long moment . Then , just as quickly , she pulled his head down to whisper directly into his ear . " Scoundrel ! " The voice was throaty and sensual and made his knees weak . Then her lips fastened on his for a kiss so loving and deep it made him slightly dizzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fluid motion on the conductor 's cue and began playing ; within moments the room was filled with a dazzling array of movements flowing with the timeless rhythm of the waltz . " Dance with me ? " She smiled , dazzling him all over again . " Whatever you want , you 've got it , " he said helplessly . Hand in hand , they ran lightly down the stairs . Once they swept into the crowd , it was n't long before everyone began voluntarily moving back to watch the grace and grandeur of this special couple , a man and a woman who had adoring eyes only for each other . Their movements intimately in tune , Michael and Elizabeth Whittaker were so enchanted by the beauty of the music and each other , they had no idea they were the only ones left on the floor . They were the center of attention , but had no clue until the dance ended and spontaneous applause erupted . Startled , they looked around , bewildered . He merely laughed with pleasure , while Elizabeth 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Michael ducked into one of the hallways to escape , wanting some privacy . Elizabeth 's face was pink ; she had totally forgotten she was in a public place . How could she still feel like a newlywed after being married to this man for so many years ? Michael 's face beamed . He was consumed with the pleasure of knowing he was exactly where he wanted to be with precisely the right person . Life was good , so very , very good . Still laughing , he led the way into his empty office . The door was soon firmly shut and locked . Elizabeth , now relaxing , smiled back at Michael , knowing there was no place in this world she would rather be than here , with her very foolish husband . Her color deepened at the way he was looking at her . He loved it that after so many years of marriage she was still vulnerable enough to blush . " I love you , Mrs. Whittaker , " he said softly , holding her closer and closer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think ... , " she whispered , looking at him and then dropping her eyes to his mouth . " You think ? " he asked , doing the same . " Yes , I think I might be able to ... " She breathed deeply as he pulled her closer . " You might be able to ... , " he prompted , kissing her forehead . " To say ... , " she whispered , her voice low , her breathing shallow . " Say ... " He leaned closer , breathing in her fragrance . " The same thing , " she finally breathed , closing her eyes , ready to lose herself in him . He suddenly stopped moving , which was enough to cause her eyes to fly open and see dark eyes brimming with laughter . " You love Mrs. Whittaker , too ? " She blinked and threw back her head in laughter , then they held on to each other as they both dissolved into giggles . " You wretch ; you are a wretch , " she gasped , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off in a definitive kiss that went on and on ... then there was no more conversation . Their bodies swiftly folded into each other , enjoying a familiar and exciting duet of touching and kissing ... The small rattle of a hospital door jerked Michael awake , the dream that was a memory shattered like glass breaking . Quickly he looked toward the bed . No movement . Good . God knows she needs to rest . He quietly met the doctor right inside the room . Michael motioned toward the hall and they did n't speak until the door was firmly closed behind them . " Well ? " The question was stark , asked roughly by a man sandwiched between a myriad of dreadful possibilities . Michael already knew a stroke , the first suspected cause , had mercifully been ruled out . He could barely breathe waiting for the news . Records in hand , the doctor walked over and sat down on a nearby padded bench . He hit with the good news first . " It 's not a brain tumor as we feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with relief , he sagged against the wall , his eyes closing briefly . Nothing , he was sure , could be worse than that suspicion . " Then what is it ? Do you know ? " Dr. Gordon Jones did n't like giving bad news to his patients ; it was that much harder when it was a friend . He said nothing , merely held out a piece of paper . Michael looked at it and his mouth went dry and his heart was suddenly beating so hard his chest hurt . The noise in his head was deafening . Gordon was speaking , but Michael just looked at him , dazed . " What ? " " Multiple sclerosis , as you may know , is chronic and incurable , but there are some new therapies that might buy us some time . My recommendation is to get her started on one as soon as possible . And Michael , there is every reason to be hopeful . Research is getting closer and closer . I do n't want you , or her , to forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gordon wondered if his friend even heard him as he saw the stunned look , the wash of countless emotions sweep over Michael 's face . He was sorry . But there was nothing he could do . " Do you want me to tell her ? Or would you rather- " Michael shook his head immediately . " God , I do n't want to . But I 'll try ... tomorrow . After I see how she is . Do you ... think she 'll be better ? " Gordon shrugged . " Possibly . Hopefully . I 'll be here early to check on her . " Michael nodded . " I 'll be here . " He looked hard at the doctor . " You are quite sure ? " His voice was colorless . " Completely sure . I 've been consulting with the best neurologist in the city . He concurs . The MRI shows more than one lesion . Lesions or scarring is the result of the inflammation , " he explained , " and that 's causing the symptoms . The loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be temporary . However , there may be some residual impairments . Or not . We 'll just have to wait and see . " They stood and Gordon gave Michael a reassuring handshake . " Do n't forget , there is a great deal of promising research going on . " With these hopeful words hanging in the air , he left . Michael walked into the silence of a deserted parking lot , shadows from the streetlights making it an eerie and unfamiliar place . He got into his car carefully , his movements as weighted and as heavy as his spirit . When he arrived home the house was dark and looked as lonely as he felt . He entered through the back door , flipping on lights as he moved from room to room . He retrieved yet another newspaper from the front porch and tossed it on top of all the others that had been left unread over the past days . Last month it had seemed imperative to keep pace with current events nationally and internationally . Now the only event he was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrouding it . Eventually the night began bowing out to morning and Elizabeth woke early , with no memories of the dreams that raced and snatched through the night , leaving only a dim trace of confused and scattered emotions . Slowly , tentatively , her blue eyes opened to a shadowed room , a few faint brushes of gray etched on the drawn shades . Tight , anxious breath escaped in a singular sigh of relief . Gone was the awful spinning , like an out-of-control top , and now that the world was no longer twirling it was soundless , the quiet so rich she felt she could snuggle down into it . This was not the case days ago , or was it weeks ? Time had little meaning then . A second had taken on the weight of hours as she waited and prayed and hoped and bargained for life to shrink back to normal . That infamous moment when she had got up in the middle of the night and stepped out of bed into a frenetic world of swirling motion with earsplitting calamity was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own body , nothing worked , it was too horrible ... But now , in its place was the world she knew , had known all her life , one of checks and glorious balances , of gravity and reality that could not do what was unintended . The relief was enormous . How long had it taken for this to be resurrected ? Had it happened a month ago ? Two days ago ? She was clueless . Elizabeth stretched timidly , rewarded as a smile began to erase the worry from her face . Everything worked ! Her legs were just where they were supposed to be . She could feel them and almost laughed out loud at the pleasure of it all . She looked toward the clock ; it was very early . She should be sleeping . Then her eyes caught the play of light from the early morning sun on the wall and she was mesmerized . How could something that was nothing have such energy ? She wondered what music made it dance so lively . When she noticed the clock again she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early morning reached for her , pulling grateful eyes slowly shut , and she drifted off to sleep a little longer . Her last conscious thought was heartfelt prayer : Thank You , God ! Hours later , with her eyes still closed , Elizabeth could feel Michael 's presence . A smile started lifting her heart , and when he leaned near enough to kiss her forehead , blue eyes opened slowly , cautiously . " Michael , " she breathed , embracing the smile he gave her and giving one in return ; she was so happy to see him . His heart jumped . " Elizabeth darling , how are you today ? Better ? " His eyes were encouraging but the voice was tentative . " I can hardly believe how much better I am today ; it 's a miracle . " He had missed the sound of her voice , he suddenly realized . It had been several tense days , and she had been too dizzy , too sick to do more than slur a few words together , or to whisper , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moved him nearly to tears . Her voice was a husky alto and danced with the cadence of cultured Virginia at its southern best , like a pretty woman wrapped in fur-and nothing else . He cleared his throat . " Nothing could make me happier , Beth . " Impulsively she held out her arms . " Watch . " Both arms straight out from her sides , she held his gaze , then shut her eyes and slowly brought both hands with knowledge to touch the tip of her nose . She felt his exultation even before he hugged her . " Elizabeth , my God , that is wonderful . It 's incredible . " Yesterday she could n't do this simple thing . That she could today was too wonderful to put into words . Moments later the door swung open and Dr. Gordon Jones walked in , shuffling papers . He was a tall , solid man who was often unkempt . Either his hair was in need of a trim or his shirt was skewed because buttons done in a perpetual hurry were mismatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonessentials . His appearance was deceiving because he was a first-rate doctor . And the kind of friend who 'd meet you anywhere at a moment 's notice if you needed him . Elizabeth clutched her husband 's hand a little tighter as Gordon came closer . The doctor sat down in the small rolling chair , dropped the charts on the side of the bed , and smiled . " How are you feeling this morning ? " " Incredibly better . Whatever is in that liquid you have dripping through my veins ? Why , it must be magic ! " Her smile became a little smaller as she asked the next reluctant question . " Gordon , what happened to me ? " She gripped Michael 's hand even tighter . Gordon 's eyes glanced toward Michael , eyebrows raised . He noted the slight shake and cleared his throat and donned his professional cloak . " Elizabeth , the good news is that it 's not a brain tumor- " Her shocked exclamation cut him off . " No one told me that was ever considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Michael and saw his face redden . " I did n't want to worry you , Elizabeth , until we knew for sure . Remember , you were n't in any shape to ... discuss this . " He squeezed her hand , his face anxious . Elizabeth 's attention riveted on the doctor . " So ... now do we know-for sure ? Do you know , Michael ? " Again this was directed at her husband , but he kept his eyes averted while he frowned . " Gordon told me last night , Elizabeth . You were asleep and I was n't about to wake you . I was going to tell you this morning , but , well , there was n't time . Gordon can explain it better than I. And then you can get mad at him ; you know , the bearer of bad news and all . " He was so nervous he hardly knew what he was saying . His hoped-for levity fell flat as a burst water balloon ; he suddenly felt clammy , every bit of him dreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , felt her hand leave his . " I would never get angry at you , Michael , for telling me the truth . " The words were quiet , but he heard the reproach and was momentarily surprised . What had he done wrong ? " Gordon , if it 's not a brain tumor , what is it ? " With a neutral voice he gave her the clinical details . " Multiple sclerosis , probably the milder form , which is relapsing/ remitting . You 've responded well to the treatment ... " He continued talking , giving her an overview and then a detailed clinical description of the disease . Most of it she could n't understand . As she tried to listen intently to everything he said , one word bolted from the rest and she repeated it in disbelief . " Incurable ? " In others ' lives , she knew there were some things medicine could n't cure , but now that it was personal , she could n't believe it . " Yes . However , there is every reason to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
