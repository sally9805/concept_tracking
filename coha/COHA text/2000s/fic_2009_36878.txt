" They 're ruining everything . " The words tangled in Karol Simon 's throat as she watched in horror as a backhoe bit into the tree house she and her family had constructed with their former neighbors and best friends Hope and Singh . The rest of the yard , including Hope 's prize-winning roses and the strawberry bush the children had planted , lay in heaped mounds of roots and blooms . <p> To Karol , it looked a lot like her life . <p> Her tears , few at first , now streamed down her face as she watched butterflies and birds flee into her yard to escape the destruction of their homes and so many of Karol 's memories . She wanted to run to her husband , to collapse into his arms Instead , she pulled the curtain back farther , using it to wipe her tears . " It looks like a cemetery , " she said without turning around , certain Rob was n't listening . <p> He was . " Get away from the window , Kay . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think I do n't know how much you miss Hope ? I miss Singh , too . But the Lord led them to another place , to another job , to other  --  " <p> She held up a hand . " Do n't say it . " <p> " I will say it . To other friends . Hope and Singh are going to find new friends . A new church . A new life in North Carolina . That does n't mean they 'll forget us here in Tallahassee . It 's just a chance to share them with someone else . " <p> Rob laid aside his Linux Pocket Guide and stood . Four strides brought him to the window . His weekend work boots struck the floor with the same confidence she heard in his voice . Not so long ago , Karol had heard the same assurance in her own voice . Was she the same woman who 'd once run Vacation Bible School and the women 's ministry committee ? These days the only running she did was from herself and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sad for a little while , but this was more than that . <p> Karol needed her . <p> She had n't realized how much her friend helped her be a good mom , a good wife . Hope had a houseful of children , seven in all , and taught her children at home . She 'd taught Karol a lot about being a mother and being a friend . <p> Now that the crew next door had moved away , though , Karol could n't just pick up the phone and call . Their busy schooling schedule had been easier to interrupt when it only meant walking next door and waiting for a break in the action . Now when Karol called , she got the answering machine indicating the family 's school hours . In the evenings , Hope was tired with moving in at first and then Karol started to unravel and did n't want to call and detail her failures . She called her friend less and less these days and seemed to lose it more and more . And her husband was starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart pound as Rob took her hand . Her pulse quickened , too , both in anticipation and fear . Things had grown awkward between them . Rusty . She was n't ready to deal with him quite yet , though lemon Pledge and sawdust were a hard combination to ignore . <p> He knew it , too . Rob stood close behind her , running his hands over hers until she released the curtain . He brushed away her last tear with his thumb before lacing his arms around her waist . She closed her eyes as his stubbled face prickled against her smooth one , waiting for the kiss that was sure to come . It 'd be a soft one , right in the curve of her neck most likely . Even after three kids , he still knew how to buckle her knees . <p> He kissed her ear instead , first with his lips and then with a whisper . " I know this is hard , honey . We all knew it would be . I get up every morning and reach for the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , only to realize he 's gone . I know it 's even deeper with you and Hope , but maybe God has a purpose in this , for us as well as them . <p> " We 'll see them soon enough . Charlotte is n't that far away . They mentioned coming down for Ryan 's birthday , remember ? And we 're taking Mia over for hers and Eden 's party next month . Until then , I figure we can work on some things between us  --  you and I. For starters , I was thinking that maybe I could be your best friend again . " <p> Karol swallowed hard and closed her eyes , drinking in this closeness with her husband . There had been a time before , when Hope and Karol had been close , but she and Rob had been closer . He had been her world . Then storms came and shook their little marriage tree , blowing away some of the blossoms , shaking off much of the fruit . <p> Hope had helped her push things down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day . Now Karol would have to do that alone . Rob wanted to help , to be friends , but there were things that she used to tell Hope that she just could n't say to her husband . What would he do if he knew that sometimes she did n't like her life or herself ? What would he think if he knew that sometimes she just wanted to run away ? <p> He 'd think that you 're human , Karol . He is , too . <p> When women from church had come to Karol for advice about their marriages , she 'd reminded them that they 'd married sinners , broken people who continued to need forgiveness once the honeymoon was over . It had all made so much sense to her back then , until the stitches on her own marriage had loosened . Before then , she 'd never understood those couples who disappeared and showed up with other spouses , the ones who lived in the same houses but drove to service in separate cars . <p> Those were the couples who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the couples ministry that had met at Hope and Singh 's . One by one , those couples had disappeared : divorced , separated , moved away . They had discovered , as Karol had , that family came at a cost , that love required effort . <p> Rob kissed the top of her ear again and tightened his hands around her . She rested back against him and wondered if he was n't trying to get her to hear him . To really listen . Sometimes that was so hard to do , even though Karol tried . <p> She was blessed to be this man 's wife , the mother of his children . And now here she was , coming undone over new neighbors . Once more , she lifted her hand to the curtains , a green gingham set Hope had taught her to make during the months after Mia was born , the summer of darkness . At the thought of those hard days , her worst postpartum depression ever , Karol let the fabric fall fromher fingers . Nothing was worth going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " I mean it . I want to be your best friend . " <p> She turned to face Rob , trying to ignore the creaking sound as the tree house toppled to the ground next door . Would these strangers burn the wood they 'd all signed and decorated , or should she go over and beg for it ? No , it was their house now . She had to let it go . All of it . <p> Karol tried to laugh but it came out more like a groan . She punched Rob 's shoulder lightly , then squeezed it . <p> " You are my best friend , silly . You 're just not acting like it . Hope would n't take their side against me . " <p> Rob 's dimples appeared , but his eyes went dull . She 'd chosen to stay on the surface of things , skimming across the hurt he wanted to dive into . He joined her in the chitchat with a reluctant smile . " Whose side ? The new neighbors ' ? Or the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , once again wondering how he 'd ended up with her . He had a careless beauty about him , a bearing that made him look like a king in a pair of jeans . Three kids had moved her body parts to new zip codes and left her face looking more like her mother 's than she wanted to admit . Except for the sprinkles of gray in Rob 's beard , he looked the same as the day they 'd wed . Unless you looked closely at the years in his eyes , he did n't look much different from the husband of the young couple who 'd moved in next door . Was this how the two of them had seemed to Hope and Singh ? She peered through the window again , trying to convince herself otherwise . <p> The woman , " Dianne with a y " as Hope called her , shouted over the noise for the men to dig up a shrub they 'd missed . No , she and Rob had n't been quite like this . This was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in her own house , it must be contagious . " The kids are definitely out of control . It seems like they 're screaming at me every minute now . Like they 've totally forgotten how to communicate . " <p> Rob 's look conveyed his thoughts but he voiced them anyway . " Maybe we 've forgotten how to communicate , hon. Things have beenhard lately . They lost their best friends , too . There 's no one to play with . Naturally they 're going to be a little out of sync . " <p> Out of sync ? " Judah tried to put Mia in the dryer yesterday , Rob . Ryan hid in the closet reading a book so that he did n't have to deal with them during the whole ordeal . When they found him , he shut them in there ! <p> " They are more than out of sync . And do n't start with that ' we 've forgotten how to communicate ' stuff . I know what you really mean . You mean I 've forgotten how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't mean that , but since you mentioned it  --  you have been screaming quite a bit lately . It seems like we 're going back in time . I have to catch myself . Yesterday , I almost started screaming , too . " <p> Karol rolled her eyes . As if . " You did not . " <p> More dimples . " Okay , so I did n't , but I thought about it . Anyway , I am on your side , both with the kids and with the neighbors . I just do n't think you 're seeing the big picture right now because you 're hurting over losing Hope . Singh got a good opportunity there . He prayed about it and chose , with Hope , to make this move . Do n't forget that . We will get through this . I 'd rather come out of it with a good relationship with our kids and our neighbors . " <p> Karol could n't help being stung by the truth in Rob 's words . The move had been unexpected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A slim possibility . And yet , Hope had n't thought twice about leaving her behind . It was right , of course . Singh was her husband . Hope 's only hesitation had been the house . None of them had believed that it would sell  --  for so much and so quickly . It was a deal they could n't refuse . A God thing . And yet , Karol could n't help feeling as though someone had ripped the rug out from under her . <p> More like the security blanket . <p> " You want to have a good relationship with those two ? Even if they 're insane ? I mean look at them . " She pointed out the window . " They 're so so " <p> Rob planted his chin on her shoulder . " What ? Young ? " <p> " Skinny ! " Karol said , louder than she 'd meant to . Was the window still cracked from airing out the living room after Mia 's pull-up explosion this morning ? Surely not . Her husband chuckled and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " I 'm serious . They 're skinny and young and weird and they have no kids . " <p> " We were skinny and young and weird and when we moved in next to Hope and Singh , Kay . " <p> " I was never skinny , " Karol said , taking a deep breath . <p> " Thank God , " her husband whispered , slipping a hand in her back pocket . " But I was definitely weird . Remember how I slammed the door on Singh that first time he came over ? " <p> " Well , in your defense , not many people serenade their new neighbors especially people who are tone-deaf . If he 'd just handed you the pie , things would have gone much smoother . " Her words slowed as her new neighbor , dressed in a celery-colored suit and tangerine pumps , tripped over the woodpile Singh had kindly left behind . " Dianne with a y " stared down at the timber in confusion and shook her head before motioning for someone to cart it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , so we were a little goofy at first , but these people are unbelievable . She looked at that woodpile like it was going to come alive and eat her . Surely she saw the woodstove when they bought the house . It 's one of the best features . " <p> Rob stroked her hair . " It 's not Hope 's house anymore . Let it go , Mom . " <p> Mom . It 'd been funny when Rob first started calling her that , but now it 'd worn thin . She 'd started it first of course by calling Rob Dad , only to abandon it when he returned the favor . Where had she gotten that from anyway ? She closed her eyes . <p> Hope and Singh . <p> It fit them . It did n't fit Karol . She wanted , needed , a name again . " I 'm trying , Rob . " His name rolled off her tongue before she could call it back , say it better . Say it the way she used to , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came out nasal and high pitched , almost as piercing as the cry from upstairs . <p> He gave her a funny look and lifted his head as if he were going to ask her something before their youngest child and only girl , Mia , let out one of her signature siren screams . <p> " Mooooooooooooom ! " <p> Karol pinched her eyes shut . Her four-going-on-fifty-year old was either going to be an opera singer or a very good referee . Either way , naptime was over . Not that it had ever started really , but after little Mia 's poopy finger painting incident this morning and five-year-old Judah 's egg juggling at lunch "  --  I thought they were boiled !  --  " her three children , especially the oldest , who only liked to encounter body fluids on the page , had gladly escaped to their rooms . <p> Now they were up and ready to roll and she 'd been too busy staring at the mess next door to get together an activity for them . After a morning of Saturday cartoons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until lately , anyway . <p> Her oldest son , Ryan , must have been thinking the same thing because he switched off the TV and started reading his younger brother and sister a story . Though only a few weeks shy of his eleventh birthday , Ryan had an old soul . His younger brother and sister drove him crazy and often interrupted the book he always seemed to be reading , but Ryan always knew what everyone needed  --  especially Karol . She mouthed a thank-you to him . He replied with a curt nod , which meant she 'd probably have to make it up to him with brownies . <br> Continues ...
