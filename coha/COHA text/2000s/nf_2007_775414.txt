one // America ? s Cheapest Family // We ? ve been called " America ? s Cheapest Family , " " the First Family of Frugal , " " cheapskates , " " thrift-a-holics , " " tightwads , " or one of many other less flattering terms . Even calling us by our real last name , Economides , relates to saving cash . Yes , that ? s our real name  --  it ? s pronounced " econo-mee-dis . " It ? s Greek and means " son of the steward . " // As the nicknames make clear , we don ? t like to spend a lot of money . But we don ? t economize just for the sake of skimping . We have big dreams  --  goals that together we are working toward . We are living proof that even in tough economic times , it ? s possible to : // *Raise responsible kids // *Purchase a home and pay it off in nine years // *Buy cars for cash // *Enjoy fabulous debt-free vacations // *Feed a growing family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Put savings in the bank // What ? s more , all this was done during the first twelve years of our marriage on an average income of less than $35,000. // A Wish Fulfilled // This is a book we wish had existed when we were starting out on our financial journey . We ? re not going to bog you down with pages of hard-to-follow economic theory and calculations . Instead , we focus on practical advice that even the most financially challenged can easily implement . America ? s Cheapest Family Gets You Right on the Money will show you how to buy groceries smarter and less expensively , create a household budget that really works , buy affordable cars and homes , find alternative sources for dressing fabulously , deal with medical care and expenses , discover fun recreational activities that are free , plan and take great vacations that don ? t break the bank , teach kids to earn and manage money , build a great savings plan for the future , get out of debt and emerge from the vicious cycle of living paycheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us has a finance or accounting background . Neither of our parents taught us to manage money  --  they were frugal , but by no means financial wizards . We are just an average couple who have discovered the secrets to living well on way less than most people can imagine . // Many people believe that thrifty living can be more easily accomplished in a rural setting . We are here to tell you that it just isn ? t so ! Living in the suburbs all of our lives , we can strongly say that there are great bargains to be had at every turn . With a dense population comes greater opportunities to scoop up steep discounts and free items . // Writing from the perspective of a family , we hope to bring our message to every age group . The younger generation needs to hear that there is an alternative to today ? s credit-charged lifestyle  --  frugal living can be fun and very rewarding , something our children know well . Those in the throes of the middle years , whether raising kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work doesn ? t need to own them . We can vouch for the fact that they can live on less and still reach incredible goals . And as we edge our way toward retirement , we can offer guidance to seniors , many of whom live on Social Security or are learning to stretch their savings . As economizers , we proclaim that no matter what your financial state , and regardless of what the economy is doing , you can not only survive but thrive . // Three Principles for Getting you Right on the Money // There will be three themes that you ? ll see recur throughout this book : avoid debt like the plague , live below your means , and embrace the thrifty lifestyle . // Avoid Debt Like the Plague // Why avoid debt , especially when many financial experts advocate credit card usage to establish a good credit score ? Because the overuse of credit actually lowers your standard of living . After spending freely , eventually you ? ll have to pay back what you ? ve borrowed . This will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on today ? s needs rather than yesterday ? s desires . The restriction of your cash flow after experiencing credit-enabled " freedom " is always a bitter pill to swallow . The average American family has a credit card balance of over $7,000 , and we have seen the dark side of credit abuse in which relationships and families crumble under the heavy weight of unpaid debts . The good news is that most people can be debt-free ( with the exception of their home ) in about eighteen months if they develop a plan and stick with it . We ? ll show you exactly how it can be done ! // While some call us naive to live without the " benefits " of credit ( that ? s right , we don ? t have any credit cards ) , we ? re here to say that it can be done  --  and life can be good ! We have more things than we need , experience more good living than we deserve , and thoroughly enjoy all that we can afford . Can life be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This important principle is best accomplished by using a written budget . This is really much easier than you think  --  and in Chapter 3 : Budgeting we ? ll show you how you can use a budget to set aside money in advance of all your expenses . In today ? s fast-paced lifestyle , spending can easily get out of control . A budget is a great tool to manage spending and makes living below your means achievable . How do you know when you are living below your means ? Is it when all the bills are paid and you ? ve still got money left over ? We think it ? s much more than that . Budgeting is the cornerstone of family finances . In every chapter we ? ll build upon that foundation with loads of ideas to free up money that you didn ? t even know you had . // Embrace the Thrifty Lifestyle // Being thrifty means that we should always strive to be efficient and resourceful with what we have . ( Uggh ! That sounds about as exciting as oatmeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle as a game and the savings in time and money as the prize . Every chapter will contain tips , secrets , and new skills you can learn to help you win every time . // Many people say that avoiding credit , living below your means , and being thrifty are a waste of time . Ha ! We say that as you experience success in reaching your financial dreams ( and you will ) , you ? ll be so convinced these practical principles work that you ? ll never go back to the way you were living before . And you ? ll leave the scoffers behind you , eating your financial dust ! // How " America ? s Cheapest Family " Got Started // When we dreamed up the idea for the HomeEconomiser newsletter in March 2003 , we had no idea that our thrifty advice would be so warmly embraced . There was tremendous interest from the media , and within one month several newspaper stories appeared , as did TV spots and radio interviews . In the next eighteen months the story spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hong Kong , Turkey , Australia , and New Zealand . // We were first hailed as " America ? s Cheapest Family " when we appeared on Good Morning America in 2004 . Initially we flinched at the use of the word cheap . Ugh ! We have never thought of ourselves as cheapskates . We think of ourselves as deal makers and bargain hunters . But in a language that has no positive adjectives to describe people who live within their means , are careful to evaluate every purchase , and always have money in the bank , we can understand the dilemma . To a world that loves to spend , those of us who love to save just aren ? t looked upon in a positive light . What options are available to reporters try- ing to describe a family they believe to be the ultimate in our line of work ? Are we the Frugalest ? The Most Miserly ? The Tightwaddiest , the Thriftiest , the Most Parsimonious ? The Economical Economideses ? Or the Super Skimpers ? If they called us Smart Shoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t shop as we do ? After a long evaluation and numerous discussions , we decided that if being " America ? s Cheapest Family " provided us with a platform to help many thousands of families break away from financial enslavement , then we would be willing . ( Besides , it ? s much easier for most people to pronounce than Economides. ) // Necessity Is the Mother of Economizing // Annette was raised in a large Italian family on Long Island , New York , and Steve grew up in a large Greek family on the South Side of Chicago . We met in 1979 , married in 1982 , and began our frugal journey together . As a newly married couple , we received lots of advice . Some family members recommended that Steve should work two jobs and Annette ought to work as well  --  all this so that we could save our money and purchase a house in three years ? time . But Annette wanted to learn to make our home and we wanted to be able to spend time together as a newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steve worked just one job , while Annette stayed home and stretched our money until it begged for mercy . // By our first wedding anniversary , our family had grown to three . Steve was earning a whopping $7 an hour as a graphic designer . Annette worked diligently following our spending plan  --  pinching pennies really paid off as our savings grew . In his best-seller Life ? s Little Instruction Book , H. Jackson Brown Jr . wrote the following to his son : " When starting out , don ? t worry about not having enough money . Limited funds are a blessing , not a curse . Nothing encourages creative thinking in quite the same way . " This quote describes our early years to a T , and we certainly did feel blessed . // Almost exactly three years later , with baby number two on the way , we purchased our first home  --  a four-bedroom repo-fixer-upper . We put 15 percent down and then began aggressively paying down the principal and fine-tuning our spending plan . Nine years later , we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income at that time was less than $35,000 . Making the last payment was a monumental occasion for many reasons , not the least of which was that we were now totally convinced that thrifty living really did pay off . Our kids were happy , and we had many of the things that you would associate with a suburban family  --  except that we had absolutely no debt . // We ? d been married twelve years by 1995 , and our family had grown to include five children . Our wonderful 1,450-square-foot home , however , seemed to have shrunk . We were literally tripping over each other . After months of searching , we bought and moved into a much larger house , our dream home . It was comparatively huge  --  3,500 square feet with five bedrooms . The house was set on three-quarters of an acre with a citrus orchard  --  and lots of room for the kids to learn , grow , and do plenty of chores . Applying the same principles we used in our first home , we ? ve continued to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some retirement savings , and buy a couple of new ( used ) cars with cash . Our income has increased in the intervening ten years , but we kept our expenses low and concentrated on making our money stretch as far as we could . // While financial goals are important , our greatest success has been raising five well-adjusted , happy children : John , twenty-three , Becky , twenty-one , Roy , seventeen , Joseph , fourteen , and Abbey , twelve . Economizing as a family has taught our kids important lessons about managing money , grounded them in nonmaterialistic values , and , most significantly , brought us together as a family . We ? ve chosen to involve our children in managing our household finances and in turn , they have helped us economize better . Our daughter Becky discovered the thrill of consignment store shopping when she needed a dress for the prom  --  she uncovered a stunning lavender gown for less than $20 . Our youngest son , Joseph , absolutely glowed when he encountered a virtually new baseball bat that retailed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our youngest daughter , Abbey , was thrilled to find a long-desired Barbie horse at a silent auction fund-raiser . Not only did she use her own money for a wonderful toy , but the money went to a great cause . We know that our tightwad ways can teach the next generation skills that will last a lifetime . // We ? ve been asked many times if financial success would alter our lifestyle . It hasn ? t and won ? t . While our economizing started out of necessity , it has now become a creative and enjoyable lifestyle that we would never abandon . We have discovered an equilibrium in our lives and a contentment in what we possess . Our greatest desire is to help others discover the same peace and contentment. // Reaching Out // In October 1983 , Steve stood up in front of a group of 150 men from our church . As a young man just starting out on his financial journey , he asked if there were any older men who would be willing to help us and other young families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . Not one of them offered to help . Steve was flabbergasted . As we refined our saving and money management skills over the years , people started asking us for advice . Since then we have coached scores of individuals and families , helping them straighten out some pretty sticky financial situations . In dealing with creditors , past-due bills , and bloated budgets , we ? ve helped these families cut a path through the money jungle to the pastures of financial stability . In many cases , we ? ve had to disentangle them from a credit-induced paralysis and help them see the value of using a little bit of planning and a lot of creativity instead of their credit cards . The results have been heartwarming . // For five years we managed a volunteer financial coaching ministry at our church . At that time our kids were relatively young ( ages one through twelve )  --  a full-time job in itself . Add to that Steve ? s ever- increasing work responsibilities , and we came to realize that this growing ministry was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turned over the reins of the ministry , it consisted of seventeen volunteer counselors whom we had trained , with over seventy people then being helped by the ministry . // In 2003 , after twenty-one years in the workforce , first as a graphic designer and later as an advertising account executive , Steve quit his job . We felt led to help more people , but at a less frenetic pace , so we decided to pursue teaching about economizing full time . // We took our personal lifestyle and our many coaching experiences and put them in written form  --  and the HomeEconomiser newsletter was born . The response from readers has been amazing : families are taking control of their finances and seeing fantastic results . In three years ? time we expanded from local distribution to having subscribers in numerous countries around the world . Many readers have said that through reading our newsletter they have come to feel like our family is part of their family . We hope you ? ll feel the same way too . Writing this book is an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , and thousands of hours spent helping others reach their financial goals . // We also know that there are some of you out there who could run circles around us with your thrifty knowledge and habits . We applaud you and urge you to keep setting the standard for careful living . We realize that we ? re still a work in progress , always looking for new ways to improve . We hope that those of you who are black-belt economizers will catch the vision and join with us in helping so many others who are looking for ways to make their money go further . // How To Maximize Your Use of This Book // The concept for this book has been developed from our own family budgeting habits , years of personal budget coaching , and family budgeting seminars that we have presented since 1989 . The process of going through every area of a family ? s budget as we do in this book and sharing how we manage expenses is similar to what we did in the past , sitting around our kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of the following pages as your own private coaching session ! // While we ? ve included hundreds of ways to help you make your money go further , we couldn ? t possibly cover every area of household finances . It would make this book an enormous reference manual instead of an easy-to-read guide with some humor mixed in to help the medicine go down . // This book can be used any number of ways : you can read through it from start to finish , you can refer to it as a reference manual , or you can just jump from chapter to chapter to deal with needs as they arise . For instance , if you discover that the amount you ? re spending on kids ? clothes has gotten out of hand , read the clothing chapter . If your utility expenses are crippling your budget , read the utilities chapter . // We ? ve put much thought into the order of the chapters in this book . We start with the grocery chapter because for most families this is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with budgeting , because it is the foundation to building a sound financial future . It has been the single most valuable tool in helping us reach our financial goals . The chapters that follow are organized from the necessities down to the more optional expenses in the family budget . We put the debt chapter near the middle of the book because we didn ? t want to hit you with a lot of heavy stuff right away . But if you are struggling with a mountain of debt , you may want to start with Chapter 7 and then read the rest of the book in order . We know that our chapters may not be in the same order as most financial books ( like our attitudes chapter , near the end of the book ) , but then again , we ? ve always done things differently  --  that ? s what makes life with us so much fun ! // We won ? t lie to you  --  there aren ? t many quick fixes to household finance problems . Sometimes things we propose might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and take time to germinate . When a real need crops up in our lives , sometimes it ? s those crazy ideas that provide the answer we ? re looking for . We can promise that if you focus on one issue at a time , you will eventually find a solution that works for your family . And with each victory will come a renewed conviction that you can and will be able to clear the next hurdle to come your way . // We ? ve included lots of stories from our lives and from the lives of people we ? ve helped . The stories we tell are all true , but to protect the privacy of the people involved , we have changed the names and any other identifying details . Thrifty subscribers to the HomeEconomiser newsletter have also added lots of their great tips throughout the book . // The Significance of the Mouse , the Owl , and the Ant // We realize that everyone reading this book will be at a different place on their journey toward saving money . Some will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others will be seasoned veterans . In each chapter , we present three levels of practical steps that can be taken right now : the Timid Mouse , the Wise Owl , and the Amazing Ant . // What do a mammal and an insect have to do with America ? s Cheapest Family ? Well , nature plays a big role in our family . We home-school our kids and encourage them to observe and investigate animal and insect behavior . We pay attention to what these animals do , and often we become aware of how some of our own behaviors  --  good and bad  --  parallel theirs . // The habits and characteristics of three particular creatures can be an encouragement to you as a seeker of deals and discounts . Each chapter concludes with a page titled " What You Can Do Now , " in which we present three levels of application of the principles and stories that we have related in the chapter . We know that not everyone reading this book will be at the same degree of thriftiness , so we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , intermediates ( Wise Owl ) , and  --  for those hard-core tightwads  --  the advanced advice ( Amazing Ant ) . // These titles may seem a bit juvenile , but once you understand some of the characteristics of these creatures , we think you ? ll agree with our reasons for relating them to the different stages of frugal living . // Timid Mouse // Mice are shy creatures . They rarely come out during the day . At night , when they do go on the prowl , they tend to do so secretively . They stay close to the walls or other objects that will conceal them . They don ? t want to be detected . They find what they need or want , then scamper back to their hiding place and enjoy their loot. // Fledgling economizers are much the same . It may be embarrassing to think that someone might catch them at a garage sale or thrift store . They don ? t want anyone to know that they are hunting for " cheap " stuff . So they go out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late at night , when they ? re less likely to be noticed . They would be mortified if anyone knew that the clothes that they are wearing were purchased at a thrift store . Although they enjoy the bargains they find , they won ? t be quick to tell anyone else about their great finds . // It ? s okay to be timid at the outset  --  we all were a little uncertain about how and where to start . Our encouragement to the timid mice is to keep looking for new ways to save . Keep going out and searching . Soon you ? ll be so confident in your thrifty ways that you won ? t have to be so secretive about it and your pile of loot will really start to accumulate . // Wise Owl // A family of great horned owls inhabits the area around our home . We often see them fly to the top of our tallest pine trees and peer out over the neighborhood , watching and waiting for something to consume ( contrary to common belief , they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient  --  very patient . Waiting quietly and hidden , they watch . When the time is right and their quarry is in sight , they silently swoop down from the treetops and strike . They carry their prey to a hideaway and share it with their family . They ? ll stay in one area for a time , but once the food supply is diminished , they move on to greener pastures . Although they are wise in their hunting habits , they only gather enough food for a few days at a time  --  there is no reserve , so life is a constant pursuit of food . // Intermediate thrifty people are much like owls . They know that there are bargains to be found in abundance  --  they ? ll just have to watch and wait . They know that patience pays and pays big-time . They still aren ? t too keen about others knowing what they are up to and how they find their deals  --  especially if someone gets to a bargain before they do . But they are confident enough about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really doesn ? t matter . Hunting for treasure is a great way to provide for their needs , and they enjoy it . But it takes constant vigilance and consumes much of their time and mental energy . // Amazing Ant // Ants are truly unbelievable creatures . They are organized , diligent , and tireless . They use their nests to store food for their seasonal needs . In areas where winter is harsher and longer , ant nests are larger and deeper in the ground , providing room to store more food for the long winter and more protection from the cold . Ants look at the weather and plan for the future needs of their colony . When scouts go out and find food , they lay a scent trail for other workers to follow . You ? ll often see columns of ants marching ceaselessly to and from a food source . Ants are strong . They can carry material equivalent to many times their body weight . If they encounter an obstruction to their work , they either go over or around it or call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teamwork and diligence are some of their most admirable attributes . // Advanced economizers are very much like ants . Organization is their key to success . Their pantries are arranged so they can track what supplies they have and what they need , and their clothes are organized as well . They are always looking for bargains , and when they find them they let others know . The network of other frugal-minded friends they have established provides them with greater savings and the encouragement to press on with diligence in the face of a culture that wants to squish them . Planning in advance for events that they see coming in the future is their strength . They know that their kids will need larger clothes , so they develop a storage system and a network of friends with whom they can trade outgrown clothes . They store bargain-priced food to feed their family quality products at a lower cost . // How we write // This book is truly a family effort . The kids are the laboratory for many of our great ideas , and unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve given them space in each chapter to express their opinions about various topics . // We  --  Annette and Steve  --  have written this book together . For the most part , we have written in the first person plural , except when we speak of ourselves individually . There we ? ve decided to refer to ourselves in the third person  --  " Annette says " or " Steve thinks . " It makes our writing less cumbersome and easier to understand . Although it may be atypical , we write as one voice . // Too often , books on the frugal lifestyle are written by one spouse , and it leaves us wondering what the other spouse is feeling about the decisions being made . We have agreed to agree before making any major decisions . This policy may result in delays , but what ? s more important is that it builds unity and protects us from mistakes . This book was written the same way  --  together . That isn ? t to say that we agree on everything in life , but regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of every purchase , and teaching our kids to do the same , we are of one mind and on the same page . // Reference Materials // One of the most important things we ? ll teach you in this book is the power of knowledge and the value of research . In pre-Internet days , research was much more time-consuming and daunting . With the proliferation of information available through free Web sites , becoming powerfully informed is much easier . While all of our research is not done on the Internet , having access is most helpful . Throughout the book we have included recommendations for Web sites and helpful books . Our Web site , **26;587;TOOLONG , also contains a wealth of information and many more links to aid you on your quest . If this is something new to you , just remember that most public libraries offer online access and assistance in navigating the Internet. // Taking Notes // We ? ve intentionally left wide margins in this book so you can make notes , scribble down ideas , set goals , or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in here , try to document your progress somewhere . Many people say they set goals , but only a small percentage actually take the time to write them down . You are much more likely to reach your goals if you ? ve taken the time to think them through , write them down , and review them often . You should see some of our old lists of goals  --  whew , a few of the things we jotted down seem silly now . But the list of the things we have accomplished is staggering  --  it contains so many things that originally seemed insurmountable when we wrote them down years ago . // Please Be Careful // Much of the material contained in this book chronicles our experiences . There are also some ideas that have been sent in by readers of our newsletter . We make every effort to do things by the book , safely and legally . There are so many ways to save money that cheating or fudging the truth just isn ? t necessary . But economizers are typically rebels at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten path . While that is a good thing , there are risks involved with veering outside the lines . It is up to you to exercise your best judgment and care when you employ the concepts we discuss . Use what we write as a point of departure for your own research . Making sound financial decisions must be based on your personal values , time , research , and in many cases the advice of a financial professional . // Through our newsletter and its coverage in the media , America ? s Cheapest Family has touched millions of lives . We hope that this book will reach and help millions more . two // Groceries : // Savings by the Bagful // When it comes to reducing household expenses , one of the fastest and easiest ways is to look at your grocery spending habits . How much can you save ? That all depends on how much effort and time you have to spend . // According to the U.S. Department of Labor , the average American family of four spends $8,513 per year on groceries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! By comparison , we spend just $350 per month to feed a family of seven , including three growing boys ! That ? s $50 per person  --  66 percent less than the national average . Implementing just a couple of Annette ? s many strategies in your grocery-buying habits can have a huge impact on your food budget . If the average family could reduce their food bill just 20 percent , they ? d have an extra $1,702 in the bank each year . // Remember that what we share are just a few of the strategies that we use . There is so much to say that we could fill a whole volume on groceries alone . But we are going to present plenty of ideas for you to be able to save hundreds of dollars on your groceries this year . Not all may apply to your lifestyle or family , but stick with us . We ? re writing from over twenty-four years ? experience practicing and perfecting these habits . Try a few , and you may be pleasantly surprised not only with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll gain . // The Cost of Impulsiveness // When Steve was working as an advertising account executive , he had a client who marketed cheese products on military bases worldwide . We were shocked to read in a food industry publication that grocers expect six of ten items consumers pick up in the store to be unplanned purchases . Sixty percent ! // Later , Steve and this client created an in-store promotion where they set up a display showcasing regularly priced spaghetti , pasta sauce , Parmesan cheese , and Italian salad dressing . Above it was hung a banner announcing " Pasta Tonite . " They also handed out a very confusing coupon sheet that required the consumer to purchase three different items from the display in order to redeem any one coupon . Sales of the regularly priced items from the display increased 38 percent , just because it was easy for shoppers to pick up an entire meal . Coupon redemptions were less than 1 percent . The manufacturer saw a huge sales increase without having to " pay " for it through coupon redemptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales results were consistent . // J. Jeffrey Inman at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and Russell S. Winer at the University of California , Berkeley , researched the effects that in-store activity such as promotions , displays , and signage had on consumer purchases . In their study " Where the Rubber Meets the Road : A Model of In-Store Consumer Decision Making , " they present an analysis of the decisions of over 4,200 customers who made 30,000 purchases in fourteen different cities . In a nutshell , they discovered the following habits : // *Shoppers making a " quick trip " to the store to pick up a few specific items usually purchase 54 percent more than they planned . // *Forty-seven percent of shoppers go to the store three or four times each week . // *Consumers graze at the grocery store , with impulse buys making up between 50.8 and 67.7 percent of total purchases . // ( In the following three statistics , the number represents the percentage of times unplanned items are purchased from these displays. ) // *End-of-aisle displays encourage higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate impulsive purchases  --  58 percent . // *Checkout displays  --  candy and magazines  --  generate the highest impulsivity , a 64 percent rate . // ( Even though this study was conducted in 1998 , our observations and discussions with store managers tell us that if anything has changed , we as a society are more impulsive now than before. ) // The more often you go to the store , the more often you will walk past displays , endcaps of special items , and the ever-enticing goodies in the checkout lane . The more often you pass these locations , the more likely you ? ll be to spend more than you intended . This is exactly what retailers are banking on . They study the numbers , watch our habits , and record our purchases . // If you ? re not careful , a trip to the store to pick up ten items will easily grow to sixteen .
