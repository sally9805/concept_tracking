Section : Maxxam Charlie Hurwitz took on the federal government and won . One more victory like this and he 's going to be in real trouble . <p> IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MOMENT OF triumphant vindication . Charles Hurwitz , chief executive of publicly traded Maxxam of Houston , had just won one of the largest judgments ever against Uncle Sam : $72 million to reimburse his legal bills incurred over the course of his ten-year fight with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . But Hurwitz , 65 , could n't shake his notorious gloom . " I do n't want this to happen to anybody else , " he says . <p> So ended the government 's case against Hurwitz . It had tried and failed to nail him for his role in the 1989 collapse of a $5 billion ( assets ) Houston savings and loan  --  and then , in a bizarre twist , attempted to extort thousands of acres of old-growth redwood forests as the price of his freedom from liability for the S &L.; Infuriated , driven by an avenging sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , against long odds , won . In his recent opinion District Court Judge Lynn Hughes lashed the feds , saying , " the record reveals corrupt individuals within a corrupt agency with corrupt influences on it . " <p> But what price justice ? " I had no idea it would take this long , cause this much wear and tear and cost this much money , " says Hurwitz . " What I do know is that we were right . " <p> Right on principle , wrong on outcome . With this and with many another battle Hurwitz has made lasting enemies of federal , state and municipal officials , environmentalists and creditors  --  all of whom are in a position to get in his way , whatever the principle of the matter . Maxxam lost $45 million on $355 in revenue over the last 12 months . With its timber operations ( a.k.a . Pacific Lumber , $200 million or so a year in sales ) , real estate ( $100 million-plus ) and racing properties ( $50 million ) , the company has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has n't had a year of profit since 2000 . Absent some regulatory relief Maxxam 's timber business , according to the latest filings , may be forced to sell off operations and file for Chapter 11 . At a recent $33 Maxxam 's shares are trading at half what they were six years ago . Any other chief executive would have been booted by now . But Hurwitz controls 76% of the voting shares . <p> Today it 's hard to believe that Hurwitz once inspired fear as a corporate raider who survived multiple dustups with regulators . Born in Kilgore , Tex. , where his father owned a couple of clothing stores , Hurwitz earned a business degree from the University of Oklahoma and became a stockbroker for Bache Securities in San Antonio . He formed a small brokerage and investment outfit , bought Summit Insurance Co. of New York in 1970 and was sued by the Securities &; Exchange Commission for manipulating Summit stock ; he got off by signing a consent decree . After Summit went bankrupt and was liquidated in 1975 , Hurwitz was charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud for improperly shuttling funds between holding companies , settling for $400,000 . Meanwhile , he had been buying stock in McCulloch Oil Co. , taking control in 1980 and renaming it MCO Holdings . With the help of junk bond financing from Michael Milken , Hurwitz took over Simplicity Pattern Co. , spiked the dividend , took cash out of its overfunded pension plan and sold assets . The resulting company was renamed Maxxam . When friendly buyouts did n't work , Hurwitz engaged in greenmail : The directors at Castle &; Cook , the Honolulu fruit and real estate company , fended off his hostile bid but were forced to pay a 25% premium on his shares to be rid of him . <p> The deal that got Hurwitz into real trouble was an investment in 1983 for just under 25% of United Financial , a banking company that owned a Houston savings and loan called United Savings Association of Texas . Hurwitz became chairman of United Financial but held no executive position . In 1984 the bank started investing in corporate bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxxam and Drexel got very cozy during these years , teaming up for Hurwitz 's buyouts of Pacific Lumber and Kaiser Aluminum . ) That year , crushed by hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from interest-rate swaps and junk bonds , United Savings failed . Taxpayers spent $1.6 billion to bail out the bank . <p> Federal investigators badly wanted to finger Hurwitz but did n't have the goods . His indirect stake in United Savings was far too low to hold him personally liable for the thrift 's investment decisions or for his not propping up the bank with his own capital . So the government persuaded him to sign an annual tolling agreement , which allowed the feds to stop the clock and build a stronger case . In 1995 Hurwitz stopped signing . <p> That 's when the government went after him . The FDIC claimed Hurwitz acted with gross negligence and abetted the reckless investment decisions of other officers and board members of the thrift ; the agency sought damages of $250 million . It handed off the case to the Office of Thrift Supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that because Milken had helped Hurwitz gain effective control of United Financial , the bank 's purchase of $1.5 billion worth of junk bonds and other securities brokered by Drexel were " prohibited affiliated-person transactions . " The OTS suit sought damages of up to $821 million . Still , the government apparently put little stock in its chances : According to internal memos turned up in trial , the attorneys gave the case just 30% chance of winning . <p> During this time Hurwitz had been busy carving up Pacific Lumber . He nearly doubled the harvest to 285 million board-feet a year , sold a metal cutting and welding business for $300 million and San Francisco real estate for $31 million . But what sparked a backlash was Maxxam 's clear-cutting of old-growth sequoias like those in the 7,000-acre Headwaters forest . " It was the reason we were interested in Pacific Lumber , " says Hurwitz . A freshly felled giant might wholesale for $100,000 . <p> The outcry over damage to Headwaters happened overnight . Celebrities like actor Woody Harrelson were arrested at demonstrations that also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations . Hurwitz was physically assaulted and attacked on the Web site jailhurwitz.com . The anti-Maxxam cause went national after Julia ( Butterfly ) Hill spent two years living in a 200-foot-tall redwood she dubbed " Luna . " Hill came down only after her organization paid Maxxam $50,000 to spare the tree . ( It was later vandalized with a chain saw , but it survives today , with considerable metal supports . ) <p> The government exploited the tension with an unprecedented " debt for nature " proposal . Under the deal the feds agreed to drop their S &L; case against Hurwitz in exchange for as much as 44,000 acres of old-growth forest . Even the Clinton White House got involved : According to court documents , Leon Panetta , then chief of staff , sent a letter in 1994 to the Audubon Society in praise of the plan . That year Vice President Al Gore tried to twist Hurwitz 's arm . But insisting that he had done no wrong , Hurwitz refused . <p> However justified , his lonely stand cost him . Even friend George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , failed to convince him to take the deal . " George used to tell me every day to get rid of it at any cost , " recalls Hurwitz . " He said , ' It 's not worth fighting the government . Our energies should be spent in other ways . Whatever it cost , we can make that money back ; just move on . ' George died a year and a half ago . " <p> Hurwitz stubbornly held on for three years . At first that seemed like a smart move . In a 1999 agreement he sold 9,500 acres of old trees to California and the feds for $405 million , a $333 million gain . With the deal , though , Hurwitz had to abide by restrictions on how he could harvest Pacific Lumber 's remaining acreage . Getting the logging permits promised by the agreement  --  178 million board feet a year , enough to keep Pacific Lumber alive  --  would prove to be extremely difficult . <p> The agreement did nothing to end the government lawsuit , which by then had cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until September 2001 , when an administrative judge at OTS ruled that the government 's case was brought in bad faith . Finally free from defending himself , Hurwitz could have walked away and focused on his languishing businesses . Instead he was bent on revenge , filing a second motion against the FDIC for suing him in bad faith . <p> While he was winning this battle , he was losing a war . By the time of the ruling it was already too late for Kaiser Aluminum , which had a pretax profit of $66 million in 1997 when it contributed 80% of Maxxam revenues . But after years of asbestos litigation , mounting overseas competition , rising energy prices and labor costs , the aluminum company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and was liquidated . <p> Pacific Lumber has suffered , too . Profitable before the 1999 agreement , it has slipped into the red every year since , even in 2002 , the only year when it was able to harvest its promised allocation of trees . Reason : Enviros have blocked permits in prime watersheds where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash crisis of his timber operations , Hurwitz last April initiated negotiations with his bondholders to restructure the $700 million in debt loaded up on PL subsidiary Scotia Pacific . Interest on the Scopac notes totals $54 million a year , but the business ca n't cut enough trees to meet payments ; it was $2.2 million short last summer . Pacific Lumber made an emergency loan and has since expanded its credit line to pay Scopac 's interest again on Jan. 20 . But it 's an unsustainable relationship that has bondholders like Capital Research &; Management and Bank of America pushing for restructuring . <p> Hurwitz first proposed , then walked away from , a tentative agreement in September that would have exchanged $700 million in old notes for $300 million in new notes plus 90% of the equity in Scopac . Why ? He wanted a promise that Scopac could continue to supply Pacific Lumber  --  a deal breaker for the creditors . Now comes the waiting game to see who can hold out longer for the best terms . <p> Whatever Maxxam ends up with wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate investments managed by Hurwitz 's son Shawn . A few resort communities in California , Arizona and Puerto Rico , two commercial properties in Houston and Motel 6 franchises in ten states deliver annual earnings before interest and taxes of $71 million . After that there 's just a couple of racetracks  --  dogs and horses in Texas that lose $2 million a year , thanks , in part , to failed efforts to legalize video-slot-machine gambling . You make money in gaming only if the gaming regulators want you to . <p> Hurwitz says his legal crusades erased many lucrative business opportunities over the years , though he wo n't name them . So why continue down this ruinous course ? " I felt that somebody had to fight this fight , " he says , " and I wanted to be there in the end , wanted to see the last card turned over . " <p> It 's not over yet . An FDIC spokesman says the agency is confident the $72 million ruling will be overturned on appeal .
