Chapter One Three days into his involuntary vacation , Kane Travers realized one thing : he was n't a vacation type of guy . He had enough home projects to fill exactly two days . He cleaned up the yard , painted the porch railing and ripped out the built-in bookcase in the family room . He tried surfing . Running on the beach . Washing his sporty red pickup truck under the intense Hawaii sun . That blew another day . And still six days to go . Six long , boring days until he knew his fate at work . Until he heard the results of the trumped-up investigation . Rather than dwell on the mess his life had become , he inhaled , breathing the scent of warm salt water deep into his lungs . Just then , something moved off to his left . Squinting , he tried to identify the strange pile sitting about a hundred feet down the abandoned beach . Probably debris washed on shore or abandoned by the resort tourists earlier that day when the Pacific Ocean had unleashed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there , his feet sinking deep into the wet sand as pink and orange bands from the retired sunset streaked across the sky and dipped low on the horizon . How any person could hear the rhythmic beating of the waves against the shore and decide this was the perfect place to throw a used potato chip bag , he 'd never know . He 'd bought the one-level cottage hereas a place for escape . The edge-of-the-world feel appealed to him on a fundamental level . Having someone ruin the scenery with litter ticked him off . Also gave him something to do . Cleaning up the beach could knock ten or twelve minutes off his unwanted vacation time . Wearing nothing more than a low-slung pair of faded jeans , he walked the waterline back to his house to fetch a bag . Along the way , chilly February ocean water splashed across his bare feet , and small pebbles pelted his chest . He 'd taken only a few steps when a strange sensation pricked at the back of his neck . His gaze slid back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water against the beach blocked out most sounds . But , no doubt about it , this time the damn thing moved . One step toward the mass , then he saw it . A slim , bare arm . " Damn ! " He broke into a blinding run , kicking up wet sand behind him . He reached the pitiful bulge and dropped to his knees . Sweat broke out on his forehead as a wave of desperation hit him . The same frustrating mix of rage and helplessness he 'd experienced before . The worry that he was one second too late . Again . Sweeping the seaweed aside , he encountered a tattered blanket and tangled long hair . This time the bump groaned . " Can you hear me ? " He lifted the rest of the waste away from the crumpled form . Not just any form . A woman . A naked woman with a slight blue tint to her pale skin . With two fingers pressed against the cool flesh of her neck , he felt for a beat . Despite the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the normal interest that might have flickered to life at the sight of a nude female body . Three months had passed since he 'd scratched that particular itch . Not that long for some men , maybe , but about two months longer than he could tolerate without getting twitchy . On the small island , one rich in tradition , everyone seemed to know or be related to everyone else . This sense of community , combined with a few too many pushy matchmaking mothers hell-bent on securing appropriate husbands for their baby girls , made dating rough on a single man . Especially on a single man who intended to stay that way . The resulting involuntary celibacy sometimes came with the job and the life whether or not he liked it . And he did n't . Not one damn bit . But now was n't the time for those thoughts . He was n't that guy . He 'd never taken advantage of a woman in his life . Hell , this one was n't even awake . " Ma'am ? Are you hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what else to say . He brushed her wet hair off her cold cheek . Soaked from head to toe , he could n't even tell her hair color . Marks and scratches marred her pale skin . Getting tossed around in the rough water had battered her a bit , but she looked relatively untouched . Even with the surface injuries and her bedraggled condition , he saw a hint of cheekbones , a slim refined nose and a full mouth . If he did n't do something soon , she could be a fine-looking corpse . " Talk to me , " he said , as if ordering her awake might work . People told him his yell could raise the dead . He could now state with some authority that theory appeared to be wrong . With hands planted on the damp sand on either side of her head , he leaned down . His ear hovered above her mouth so he could hear over the crashing surf . Steady small puffs of air brushed against his skin , calming his anxiety . The coolness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and experience that too long in the water and hypothermia kicked in . Tropical climate or not , a body could take only so much abuse from the elements . " Ma'am ? " Her eyes stayed closed . Her body still . She needed a shower and dry clothes . Even then ... He tunneled one arm under her legs and the other around her shoulder . In one fluid move , he pushed to his feet with the injured stranger clutched to his chest . He looked up and down the beach . No one lingered except him . Quick strides turned to a jog . He had to get to the front door of his bungalow . Two hundred feet , then he could warm her up , dry her off and get whatever help she needed . There was no time to waste . He now had something to fill those long hours . He just hoped he would n't be spending the time checking her into the morgue . Annie Parks refused to open her eyes . Open eyes meant facing reality . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice cold waves only a few minutes . At least she thought that was the case . Time blended and distorted . Sluggish muscles and misfiring brain cells made thinking and moving almost impossible . Nothing about the last few hours made any sense . She remembered standing in the small bathroom of her stateroom , looking over her crude drawing of the yacht 's floor plan . She fiddled with her camera , unconsciously adjusting the settings to account for fading light . The steady beat of jazz music sounded from the main living area and adjoining dining room . With everyone enjoying a pre-dinner drink , she had the privacy she needed to study the layout of the rooms and decide where the owner would keep valuable paperwork . She had slipped out of her stained dress . The spill of red wine had given her a reasonable excuse to leave the party . The fact she had to ruin the one fancy dress she owned ticked her off , but what was one more sacrifice to the cause . She 'd sacrificed so much already . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside for her snooping . The next , someone held a bag over her head , hands went around her waist and ... splash . Then a mouthful of water followed by a hard skid to a beach landing and pain . She could n't forget the pain . Now someone held her . Sure , the guy did n't throw her back in the water , but that did n't necessarily mean things were looking up . Her back teeth slammed together with each one of his firm steps . The brisk walk cuddled against his chest had warmed her , but at this pace she 'd be broken into little pieces before they got to their destination . Wherever that was . The naked early evening jog with a perfect stranger was new , not to mention embarrassing . Plenty of fear ran through her , too . She thought about jumping out of this guy 's arms and running as fast as she could in any direction but the water . Thought about it . Even plotted out the escape . But , she knew the smarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step . She 'd spent her entire life biding time . Waiting for the right moment to get her revenge . Panic and weakness were the enemies . Two of them , anyway . During the past few hours she 'd discovered a new one of the human variety . She 'd been knocked around , dropped into the ocean and nearly drowned due to her mediocre swimming skills . All that made washing up on the beach the highlight of her evening . Not the normal day for a nature photographer . Of course , this was n't a paid assignment . This one was a personal project . An investigation gone seriously wrong . Somehow she 'd managed to stumble onto the right track . Got close enough to get tossed into the ocean . She 'd lost her camera and nearly her life . And now ... well , she did not know what was happening now . She lifted one eyelid in the barest move possible . She spied miles of muscular forearm . Tan and , she hoped , connected to the safe and friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could squawk , her rescuer balanced her body on his hip , reached for a doorknob and opened the door . She silently added strong to the list of her rescuer 's attributes . Looking through the slit under her eyelashes , she tried to scan her new surroundings . They stood in the center of a small room with a red sectional sofa as the centerpiece . Not what she imagined the home of a typical serial killer would look like . That was her first good news of the last forty-eight hours . The only good news . He started to move . With each step , she saw a flash of his bare feet against the oak hardwood floor below her . She poised for fight or flight . Tried to concentrate on getting the hell out of there-even though she still did n't know where " there " was . He threw her in the shower before she could make her big escape . Chapter Two The world spun beneath Annie until her feet landed on the cold tile floor of the shower stall . Strong arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every cell in her body snapped to life . The lethargy weighing her down disappeared with the screech of the shower curtain rings against the rod . A rush of water echoed in her ears as steam filled the room . " Here we go , " the stranger said to the room as if the nut chatted with unconscious people all the time . He balanced her body against his . Rough denim scratched against her sensitive skin from the front . Lukewarm water splashed over her bare body from the back , making her skin tingle and burn . A gasp caught in her throat as her shoulders stiffened under the spray . A scream rumbled right behind the gasp , but she managed to swallow that , too . " This should help . " He continued his one-sided conversation in a deep , hypnotizing voice . He seemed mighty pleased with himself . And since he had stepped right under the water with her , a bit ballsy for her taste . " This will feel better in a second , " he said to the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skull , replacing the frigid ocean with bathwater . He rinsed and massaged and rinsed again . The sweep of his hands wiped away the last of her confusion . With that task done , his palms turned to her arms , brushing up and down , igniting every nerve ending in their path . His chest rubbed against her bare breasts until heat replaced her chill . With thighs smashed against his legs , the full-body rubdown sparked life into body parts that had been on a deep-freeze hold for more than a year . " Better ? " She did n't answer him . Was n't even sure she could speak if she wanted to . " Open your eyes and say something . " The husky command broke her out of her mental wanderings and sent a shot of anxiety skating down her spine . This was the part of the program where she ran and hid ... and then ran some more . Naked . Alone . Strange man . Yeah , a very bad combination . " I know you 're awake . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up . Okay , fine , she got his point . Not knowing if her rescuer counted as a friend or foe , she played the scene with the utmost care . Only a complete madman would attack a vulnerable woman who did n't know her own name . If her stranger fell into that category , she 'd scream and make a mad dash into the kitchen for the nearest sharp knife . The nearest sharp anything . She groaned in pain that was only half false . " Your eyes are still closed , " he said . Yeah , pal , no kidding . " You are n't fooling me . " Well , she could certainly try . His hands continued to massage her sore flesh with just the right amount of pressure to bring her blood sizzling back to life . If he kept this up , her eyes would n't open . She 'd be asleep . She could n't remember the last time she slept through the night . Actually , she could . It had been fifteen months . Fifteen months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yacht . To flying over the side and into the water . To being in this shower . " We can stand here all night for all I care , " he said . Nothing that extreme . Maybe ten more minutes . He chuckled . " Does n't bother me . " Lucky for her she found an accommodating potential serial killer . " Because I 'm the one with clothes on , " he pointed out . Her eyelids flew open . The deep rumble of his laugh intensified . " Thought that one might get your attention . " Oh , he had her attention . All six-feet-something of him , with haunting dark eyes , straight coal black hair cut short and blunt , and chiseled high cheekbones that spoke to Hawaiian bloodlines . Her gaze dipped lower and ... damn . That gasp she 'd been holding finally escaped her lips . The part below his neck looked as impressive as his face . A broad muscular chest , every inch tan and perfect . Blue jeans balanced on lean hips . Double damn . Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wanted to . That realization got her talking . " Who are you ? " One dark eyebrow kicked up in question . " That was my question . You are ... ? " A woman in deep trouble . A woman at home with a camera and in a darkroom . A woman with a mission . The idea of confiding in someone tempted her , but she resisted . She did n't know this guy or his agenda . Hell , she did n't even know who her enemies were and why . Until she did , she was not saying a word . " I ... I do n't know , " she stammered out . She was playing a dangerous game . No other choice . Someone had pushed her off a party boat . Either Sterling Howard had figured out her real identity and ushered her off his yacht the hard way or ... actually , she could n't think of an " or " option . " Do n't know what ? " he asked . " My name . " Those deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people it 's an easy question . You 've likely had one since birth . " " I , uh , ca n't remember it , " she said , making sure her voice held the appropriate mixture of concern and shock . Funny how those two emotions came to her without any trouble at the moment . " Wait a second . You mean- " " Yes . " His hands tightened briefly on her elbows , then relaxed . " Interesting . " The longer she stood there , the more pronounced their size difference became . " Not to be rude or sound ungrateful , but could we have this little chat later ? Like , when I 'm dry and fully dressed . " " You really ca n't remember your name ? " She lifted her hands and covered her breasts . A stupid move , yes . He 'd already seen all the goods . Not that he cared one wit . He did n't appear to be staring anywhere but dead into her eyes . " Trying the dry thing now would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned off the water . " You 're saying you have amnesia ? " For a second she wondered if a person with a real case of amnesia would recognize the word amnesia . Deciding that type of thinking would drive her nuts , she answered , " Yes . " " Seems a bit convenient . " The least the guy could do was have the decency to look a little worried about her made-up amnesia story . " There 's nothing convenient about not knowing who you are . " He stepped out of the tub and grabbed up a towel for her . " Here . Dry off . We need to pump some heat into you and then ... " " Yes ? " she asked , a bit concerned about what the rest of his sentence could be . " Find some clean clothes for both of us . I 'm guessing you 'd like to be dressed when we talk . " She 'd rather skip the talking part . " Talk about what ? " " Whatever it is you 're running from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being naked , although she was n't real fond of that either . The heart-to-heart he had planned was the bigger problem . She 'd made a promise to her mother , although in her mother 's catatonic state , she likely did n't understand the vow . But that was n't the point . Annie had enough guilt for a lifetime without failing her mother a second time . (
