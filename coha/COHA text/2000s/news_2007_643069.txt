<p> WATCH your cholesterol and triglycerides . Your boss and fellow workers are counting on it . As the nation 's employers aim to get their money 's worth from ever more expensive medical insurance , many are playing a bigger role in managing and monitoring their workers ' health . <p> Employers not only want a healthy group , they want to keep a lid on health costs  --  and insurance premiums . <p> Take Intuit , the Silicon Valley software company known for its Quicken and TurboTax financial software . Intuit pays employees $100 each for voluntarily filling out an online medical questionnaire that is intended to flag problems and suggest remedies . <p> " For instance , we see you smoke ; are you willing to change that ? " said Sarah Wilkins , a senior benefit analyst at Intuit , explaining how the questionnaire might steer employees toward a stop-smoking program run by a contractor . <p> The BB &T; Corporation , a bank holding company with a big presence in the Southeast , allows workers to save 20 percent on their premiums by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn for a medical work-up and taking a fitness test on a stationary bike . <p> " We have a lot of sedentary employees , " said Steve Reeder , BB &T's; benefits manager , who said more than 90 percent of the 24,000 workers with health coverage participate in the program . <p> If the health test finds that a BB &T; employee does not meet the medical norms for his or her age and sex , the worker is assigned to a nurse who helps the person set healthy living targets and then meets with the employee periodically to see how things are going . <p> " If the nurse feels they are not making sufficient progress , they do have the ability to drop them from the program , " Mr. Reeder said , in which case the employee would lose the insurance discount . <p> With its testing , BB &T; says it has beat its competitors on medical expenses . The $193 million that BB &T; and its workers expect to spend on health care this year works out to about $8,042 an employee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person than what comparable banking companies and their workers will typically spend . <p> Textron , a multinational conglomerate that insures more than 30,000 employees in the United States , tries to head off major medical expenses by using a contractor to sift through employees ' insurance claims . If the process detects a condition that may warrant closer monitoring , the employee will receive a call from a " health coach " to offer guidance for questions to ask a doctor . <p> " Some employees say , ' No , thanks , ' " said George E. Metzger , vice president for human resources and benefits . <p> A recent national survey found many similar examples of such medical supervision by corporate America . " Employers are realizing that a good health care strategy includes health benefits and programs that incentivize employees to manage their own health , " Larry Boress , chief executive of the Midwest Business Group on Health , the nonprofit group that conducted the survey , said in a news release . <p> This approach represents a shift in thinking about how to get employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago , the vogue term in employee-benefits circles was " consumer-directed health care . " At its most generous , the phrase means that employers help pay for employee health savings accounts , where the money can grow in anticipation of medical needs . The typical trade-off is that the employee agrees to accept cheaper , barer-bones insurance with higher out-of-pocket annual deductibles . <p> When applied in Dickensian fashion , though , " consumer-directed health care " tends to translate as " You , dear consumer , can direct more of your own financial burden , " while the company may not add much to the health savings accounts . <p> In giving workers monetary incentives to pay closer attention to their health , the trade-off is that workers must agree to let the employer play a more active role in their medical care . <p> Carlson Companies , a Minneapolis holding company whose businesses include the Radisson hotel chain , plans to begin such a program in July , offering some employees the chance to win cash or merchandise for participating . <p> " We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , " said Charles F. Montreuil , Carlson 's human resources vice president . <p> The system will initially focus on employees with chronic illnesses , with the first report card geared to people who have Type 2 diabetes . The evaluation will consider whether the employee has refrained from smoking ; is maintaining a blood pressure lower than 130/80 ; keeps L.D.L. , or " bad " cholesterol , below 100 ; takes a daily aspirin if the employee is 40 years or older ; and keeps a blood-sugar count of lower than 7 by a test known as the A1c . <p> The A1c , which screens for Type 2 diabetes , is especially important to Carlson . A Type 2 diabetic " costs us about $13,000 a year on average in medical costs and time off work , " Mr. Montreuil says . <p> Every six months , employees who participate in Carlson 's program and show improvement in at least three of the five measures will be able to choose between cash or merchandise worth in the range of $100 . <p> Such detailed medical monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intuit said that when her company introduced its health questionnaire last year , she fielded many questions about who would see the data . She said that she reassured workers that no one at Intuit would have access to the questionnaires , which are overseen by Optum , a unit of the insurer United HealthCare . She also reminded them that the survey was voluntary . <p> Typically , such programs are meant to comply with the federal privacy and nondiscrimination provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and Americans With Disabilities Act , or A.D.A . Under these laws , with few exceptions , an employer is not allowed to see specific medical data about individual employees . Medical records are supposed to be accessible only to third-party health-plan administrators or other outside vendors the employee has authorized . <p> Carlson Companies ' report-card system , for example , will be managed by Fiserv , a health-plan administrator . The employees ' progress in the program will be supervised by health coaches from a separate vendor , CareAllies . Privacy rules do get broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But many legal experts say that HIPAA and A.D.A . are probably adequate for keeping ethical bosses from using medical data when deciding which employees deserve raises or promotions and which should be put on probation or fired . <p> " While anything is possible , there are already a fair number of protections in these laws to try to protect employees , " said Andrea I. O'Brien , who leads the employee benefits practice at the Washington law firm Venable . <p> At BB &T,; Mr. Reeder said that privacy and discrimination laws were more than enough to keep bosses from learning  --  or even wanting to learn  --  about a worker 's medical details . The same goes for trying to find out how things are going between employees and their nurse advisers . <p> " There 's nothing helpful for us in knowing it , " Mr. Reeder said . " We certainly do n't want managers to know that information and making bad decisions based on that information . " <p> Yet he says the corporate emphasis on healthy living does motivate workers to compare medical notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , employees talk among themselves , " Mr. Reeder said . " Wellness is really a part of our culture . " <p> #
