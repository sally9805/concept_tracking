Even chaos is a gift , when it follows a five-year curse . In the Afghan capital of Kabul , as in other cities suddenly set free from the Taliban 's medieval rule , the streets smelled of blood and joy . Taliban warriors who had promised a fight to the death disappeared in the middle of the night like a long bad dream , and by morning the people were throwing flowers at the tanks as Northern Alliance commanders rode victorious into town . There were summary executions . Bodies of the Taliban 's Arab and Pakistani fighters were branded with the mark of contempt reserved for mercenaries : Afghan bills were stuffed up their noses or into their head wounds . Wounded fighters were cornered by mobs , then shot and beaten to death , their corpses left in the streets . Yet despite the scattered fire fights , the fear of a power vacuum and the threat of renewed civil war , veterans of Afghanistan 's endless years of carnage called last week 's stunning reversal of fortunes the least bloody transition of power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a grinning commander of an armored unit , " but I never thought it 'd be this easy . " <P> And it probably wo n't be , Pentagon officials warned . No one was ready to count the Taliban defeated for good ; any victory born of treachery is hard to trust for long . Some Taliban fighters raced to switch sides to whoever offered the better deal , but others , for whom this is a holy war , blew themselves up with hand grenades before they would surrender to infidels . A week that began with warriors on horseback streaming down into shredded villages ended with U.S. commandos guiding bombers with laser beams . Other planes dropped leaflets promising a $25 million reward for the capture of Osama bin Laden , even though the hunters were unsure whether he was still in the country or in the hands of a plastic surgeon somewhere . <P> Freed from theocracy , Afghan men ignored the call to prayer , preferring instead to line up for their first shave in five years . They rubbed their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high , windy point atop the ruins to fly the kites that the mullahs had banned as frivolous . On Tuesday night , the lights of Kabul came on for the first time in weeks . You could hear music for the first time in years . Families and merchants dug up their television sets , their VCRs and tape players ; they swapped pictures of movie stars and reveled in irreverence . One group of men played soccer in the Thursday sun , the game for once not interrupted by a public execution in the stadium . Fans were actually allowed to clap and cheer , the players to wear shorts . It will take some time to sweep all the bullet casings from the field .
