JIM LEHRER : You recently described your opponent as " a disgusting , wormlike excuse for a human being . " What did you mean by that ? <P> THE CANDIDATE : I have never criticized my opponent in personal terms . This election should be about the issues and my plan and his plan . What I was referring to in that remark is the fact that my plan is better than his plan . <P> Let me tell you about my plan . Under my plan , $17.1 trillion . All current seniors would be put in a lockbox . My opponent has said $63.4 billion , but that 's simply wrong . He is misrepresenting my plan . My plan is $17.1 trillion and all seniors in a lockbox . And I will veto anyone  --  anyone , Jim , I feel very strongly about this  --  veto anyone who says otherwise . Putting seniors in a lockbox will be my Administration 's No. 1 priority . <P> So you take that $17.1 trillion , saute it lightly for 40 years and divide by 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement age without being able to read the labels on their prescription drugs . My opponent 's plan would ignore this problem for the first 23 months and then take the first derivative times 6%  --  oh , yes you would ! Yes you would ! I 've read your plan  --  but under my plan , every citizen of this country would multiply 19 by 7 and get a very large number . And I believe the American people can be trusted to perform this math for themselves , because under my plan they will be tested every 15 minutes , unlike my opponent 's plan , which would test them every 20 minutes . Testing every American as often as possible will be my Administration 's special No. 1 priority . <P> Finally , under my plan , I would run my plan past Alan Greenspan and toss the whole thing out if he does n't like it . My opponent 's plan claims to run itself past Alan Greenspan , but if you study the details , it really does n't . My plan would run my plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my opponent 's plan . Checking with Alan Greenspan will be my Administration 's superspecial priority gold No. 1 priority . <P> Now let me tell you about my opponent 's plan . His plan calls for 14 trillion minus 7 in just six years . And no lockbox . Even worse , under my opponent 's plan , 81% of all seniors . And the square root of 54 whatsoever . In my view , that is totally inadequate . It 's not a good plan . We can do better . I would n't even call his plan a plan . I 'd call it a fuzzy plan . Or no plan at all , because just six years from now is six years away . The American people are tired . <P> One of them is in this auditorium . A triple amputee from Benton Harbor , Mich. , she used her one remaining hand to drag herself along the interstate all the way to Boston so she could be with us here tonight . And this is her story . She 's an heiress of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cayman Islands , only to find that she 'd missed a filing deadline under the needlessly complex S.A.Y.W.H.A.T. law  --  and I thank my opponent for supporting this valuable legislation . But I think that 's wrong , just plain wrong , and as President I would not interfere .
