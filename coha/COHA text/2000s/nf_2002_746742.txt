Welcome Back ! <p> I hope that each of you has had a very enjoyable and productive summer vacation and that you are well rested and ready to embark on energetic and fruitful adventures in the community that you serve so well . I 'm sure that some of you are in shock . You probably ca n't believe that the summer months have passed and that it 's now time to diligently start preparing lesson plans and organizing the other multitudinous tasks that are necessary for survival during the next few months . Even so , I 'm sure that all of you are excited about the upcoming opportunities to make a difference in the lives of our most precious resource-children . I believe that it 's very important for all music teachers to take the necessary steps to transform music education into programs that will actively engage students and build a foundation for lifelong learning . Therefore , proper planning is crucial before and during the first few months of the school year . With this positive thought in mind , I hope that this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful students . <p> Connect with Music . The theme that I 've chosen for the next two years is " Connect with Music . " I feel that it is important for us as music educators to connect with the people and information that we need to accomplish our mission . This broad-based theme gives each member the opportunity to take the lead in continuing MENC 's efforts to make music an essential part of the formal education of every child in this country . If MENC is to be positioned as the leading authority for music education through its varied programs and outreach activities , then we will need a tremendous amount of advocacy efforts from every member of our association . Through this " connecting " thread , we can continue to make connections with students ( Tri-M and Collegiate MENC ) , colleagues at all levels ( preschool through university ) , school administrators , curriculum planners , school board members , PTAs , businesses , community leaders , and the community at large . <p> On June 23-24 , 2002 , I was a keynote speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Renaissance ! " in Orlando , Florida . It was presented by Arts for a Complete Education ( ACE ) and the Florida Alliance for Arts Education ( FAAE ) . The conference focused on ensuring that arts education does n't get left behind in the race for higher test scores and increased student achievement . The group consensus was that when schools , community arts groups , local arts agencies , businesses , teachers , artists , and community-builders work together , great things emerge . Because " making connections " was emphasized as an important advocacy tool for arts education , I decided to use this as the title for my address to the participants . <p> Arts Integration . Integrating the arts into the curriculum was a hot topic discussed by several of the presenters . I was particularly interested in the sessions " Integration on Stage " by Debra Barnum and " Integrating the Arts across the Curriculum : A Process for Artists and Teachers to Collaborate " by Gary Margolis and Janet Erlick . The most compelling debate about the value of arts integration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for interdisciplinary learning . Influential studies differ in their views on the subject . In Champions of Change : The Impact of the Arts on Learning , James Catterall reports that , while learning in other disciplines may often focus on development of a single skill or talent , the arts regularly engage multiple skills and abilities . However , while Ellen Winner and Lois Hetland support the assertion that arts programs add value to nonarts academic outcomes in " The Arts and Academic Improvement : What the Evidence Shows " ( sponsored by Harvard 's Project Zero ) , they contest the claim that arts programs have been empirically justified by secondary nonarts effects ( see www.pz.harvard.edu/ Research/REAP.htm for the full report ) . And the latest , most comprehensive word on the subject finds evidence for " transfer effects " from music study to cognitive development , spatial temporal reasoning , mathematics performance , self-efficacy and reading . Other transfer effects are documented for music and the the other arts . ( see http : //aep-arts.org/ for the full document ) . <p> Arts Partnerships with Businesses . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with businesses is to understand their motivations for supporting the arts and to develop partnerships that can deliver tangible benefits to these corporate partners without compromising the quality of arts programming . Most business leaders are driven by a passion and a personal connection to the community where their business is situated . Now , with the rise of the " multinational corporation , " business leaders are routinely transferred from one place to another , allowing little time to settle in or to develop a feeling of connection with the community . In addition , the pressure of generating larger profits for stockholders has changed the landscape of corporate philanthropy . So why do businesses support the arts ? In certain businesses , such as banking , legislative acts have created compelling reasons to partner with nonprofit agencies . The Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) of 1977 mandates that banks accrue " credits " for reinvestment in their communities ( see **29;3887;TOOLONG for more information about the CRA ) . <p> Another motivation may be to aid in the recruitment and retention of employees . It is well understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and research shows that this helps businesses to recruit employees . Other reasons might have to do with improving the economic welfare of a given region or with becoming associated with the goodwill generated by an exhibition or program . <p> Scores of studies demonstrate the positive impact of the arts on the economy , education , and the quality of life . These studies matter because they " give substance " to the support of the arts by corporate benefactors , who must justify this expense as a business necessity to their shareholders . Arts organizations , in turn , are becoming more savvy about ways to develop fruitful partnerships with the business community , ways that take into consideration the new realities of the multinational corporation . These partnerships can take the form of contributions of time ( human resources ) , marketing ( free advertising or publicity ) , materials , equipment , or money-all tremendously needed in today 's economic climate . <p> Does arts integration work ? Are arts partnerships with businesses effective ? Read the research . I believe that the answer to both questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make these connections . We can and we must . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Willie L. Hill , Jr . <p> By Willie L. Hill Jr. , MENC President <p>
