. In the new Lagoon Power 44 , a French builder successfully outdoes itself . If the mission is to provide a swift , seaworthy yacht with as many as four well-separated staterooms and a surprising amount of living space , the Lagoon Power 44 fulfills it admirably . An update of the popular Lagoon 43 ( over 100 were built in five years ) , the Lagoon 44 has been stretched at the flybridge . It 's a natural improvement , and it enabled the builder to add an upper dinette , sunpad and lounge , plus three helm seats . Just as important , the stretched bridge now completely shades the cockpit , which can be fully enclosed . Our test boat had the huge master suite aft that spans the 21-foot beam with a centerline king berth , enclosed head to port and large shower stall to starboard . The charter version has a pair of port and starboard staterooms , each with en suite head . Forward , the most popular layout is a pair of large staterooms with en suite heads in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office . The Lagoon has an immense salon with a wraparound settee and dining table , a stylish lower helm and a galley . Visibility is superb through the vertical windows , and headroom is well over 6 ' 5 " . The 44 benefits from comfortable seating , including Besenzoni helm seats , good space for electronics and a host of other improvements . The sidedecks are wide and well-protected by welded stainless rails . The bow has one of my favorite features : a couch for sprawling at night to watch the stars .

LAGOON AMERICA WWW.LAGOONPOWER.COM BASE PRICE ( W/TEST POWER ) : $490,000 BOX STABLE : The new 44 is based on the same hull as the Lagoon 43 , which I 've chartered in the past .

With widely spaced props , the close-quarters handling is a cinch , and the view is good from both upper and lower helms . At anchor , the Lagoon feels like solid ground . SNEEZE-FREE : One problem with power cats is called " sneezing , " when spray is blown forward and up from between the hulls as the boat goes through swells . A bulge under the tunnel on the Lagoon seems to solve that problem . That same bulge also stores the anchor rode under the windlass , which is cleverly mounted on the foredeck for ease of use .
