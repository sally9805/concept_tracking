It was too peaceful out here , surrounded by the vacuum of space and with only the continual hum of the twin ion drives breaking the silence . While she loved these moments of peace , Leia Organa Solo also viewed them as an emotional trap , for she had been around long enough to understand the turmoil she would find at the end of this ride . Like the end of every ride , lately . Leia paused a moment before she entered the bridge of the Jade Sabre , the new shuttle her brother , Luke , had built for his wife , Mara Jade . Before her , and apparently oblivious to her , Mara and Jaina sat comfortably , side by side at the controls , talking and smiling . Leia focused on her daughter , Jaina , sixteen years old , but with the mature and calm demeanor of a veteran pilot . Jaina looked a lot like Leia , with long dark hair and brown eyes contrasting sharply with her smooth and creamy skin . Indeed , Leia saw much of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own thoughts , but young woman . That same sparkle behind the brown eyes , mischievous , adventurous , determined . That notion set Leia back a bit , for she recognized then that when she looked at Jaina , she was seeing not a reflection of herself but an image of the girl she had once been . A twinge of sadness caught her as she considered her own life now : a diplomat , a bureaucrat , a mediator , always trying to calm things down , always working for the peace and prosperity of the New Republic . Did she miss the days when the most common noise around her had been the sharp blare of a blaster or the hiss of a lightsaber ? Was she sorry that those wild times had been replaced by the droning of the ion drives and the sharp bickering of one pride-woundedemissary after another ? Perhaps , Leia had to admit , but in looking at Jaina and those simmering dark eyes , she could take vicarious pleasure . Another twinge -- jealousy ?  - -  caught her by surprise , as Mara and Jaina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she pushed the absurd notion far from her mind as she considered her sister-in-law , Luke 's wife and Jaina 's tutor -- at Jaina 's own request -- in the ways of the Jedi . Mara was not a substitute mother for Jaina , but rather , a big sister , and when Leia considered the fires that constantly burned in Mara 's green eyes , she understood that the woman could give to Jaina things that Leia could not , and that those lessons and that friendship would prove valuable indeed to her daughter . And so she forced aside her jealousy and was merely glad that Jaina had found such a friend . She started onto the bridge , but paused again , sensing movement behind her . She knew before looking that it was Bolpuhr , her Noghri bodyguard , and barely gave him a glance as he glided to the side , moving so easily and gracefully that he reminded her of a lace curtain drifting lazily in a gentle breeze . She had accepted young Bolpuhr as her shadow for just that reason , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the young Noghri , at how his grace and silence covered a perfectly deadly fighting ability . She held up her hand , indicating that Bolpuhr should remain out here , and though his usually emotionless face did flash Leia a quick expression of disappointment , she knew he would obey . Bolpuhr , and all the Noghri , would do anything Leia asked of them . He would jump off a cliff or dive into the hot end of an ion engine for her , and the only time she ever saw any sign of discontentment with her orders was when Bolpuhr thought she might be placing him in a difficult position to properly defend her . As he was thinking now , Leia understood , though why in the world Bolpuhr would fear for her safety on her sister-in-law 's private shuttle was beyond her . Sometimes dedication could be taken a bit too far . With a nod to Bolpuhr , she turned back to the bridge and crossed through the open doorway . " How much longer ? " she asked , and was amused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden appearance . In answer , Jaina increased the magnification on the forward screen , and instead of the unremarkable dots of light , there appeared an image of two planets , one mostly blue and white , the other reddish in hue , seemingly so close together that Leia wondered how it was that the blue-and-white one , the larger of the pair , had not grasped the other in its gravity and turned it into a moon . Parked halfway between them , perhaps a half a million kilometers from either , deck lights glittering in the shadows of the blue-and-white planet , loomed a Mon Calamari battle cruiser , the Mediator , one of the newest ships in the New Republic fleet . " They 're at their closest , " Mara observed , referring to the planets . " I beg your indulgence , " came a melodic voice from the doorway , and the protocol droid C-3PO walked into the room . " But I do not believe that is correct . " " Close enough , " Mara said . She turned to Jaina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Rhommamool almost exclusively so ! " C-3PO quickly added , drawing a scowl from all three of the women . Oblivious , he rambled on . " Even Osarian 's fleet must be considered marginal , at best . Unless , of course , one is using the Pantang Scale of Aero-techno Advancement , which counts even a simple landspeeder as highly as it would a Star Destroyer . Perfectly ridiculous scale . " " Thank you , Threepio , " Leia said , her tone indicating that she had heard more than enough . " They 've both got missiles that can hit each other from this close distance , though , " Mara continued . " Oh , yes ! " the droid exclaimed . " And given the proximity of their relative elliptical orbits --  " " Thank you , Threepio , " Leia said . "  - -  they will remain within striking distance for some time , " C-3PO continued without missing a beat . " Months , at least . In fact , they will be even closer in two standard weeks , the closest they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thank you , Threepio ! " Mara and Leia said together . " And the closest they have been for a decade previous , " the droid had to slip in , as the women turned back to their conversation . Mara shook her head , trying to remember her original point to Jaina . " That 's why your mother chose to come out now . " " You 're expecting a fight ? " Jaina asked , and neither Leia nor Mara missed the sparkle in her eye . " The Mediator will keep them behaving , " Leia said hopefully . Indeed , the battle cruiser was an impressive warship , an updated and more heavily armed and armored version of the Mon Calamari star cruiser . Mara looked back to the screen and shook her head , unconvinced . " It 'll take more than a show of force to stop this catastrophe , " she replied . " Indeed , it has been escalating , by all reports , " C-3PO piped up . " It started as a simple mining dispute over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some kind of a holy crusade . " " It 's the leader on Rhommamool , " Mara remarked . " Nom Anor . He 's reached down and grabbed his followers by their most basic instincts , weaving the dispute against Osarian into a more general matter of tyranny and oppression . Do n't underestimate him . " " I ca n't begin to give you a full list of tyrants like Nom Anor that I 've dealt with , " Leia said with a resigned shrug . " I have that very list available , " C-3PO blurted . " Tonkoss Rathba of --  " " Thank you , Threepio , " Leia said , too politely . " Why , of course , Princess Leia , " the droid replied . " I do so like to be of service . Now where was I ? Oh , yes . Tonkoss Rathba of --  " " Not now , Threepio , " Leia insisted , then to Mara , she added , " I 've seen his type often . " " Not like him , " Mara replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice reminded Leia and Jaina that Mara , despite her nearly constant bravado and overabundance of energy , was seriously ill , with a strange and thankfully rare disease that had killed dozens of others and against which the best doctors in the New Republic had proven completely helpless . Of those who had contracted the molecular disorder , only Mara and one other remained alive , and that other person , being studied intently on Coruscant , was fast dying . " Daluba , " C-3PO went on . " And of course , there was Icknya --  " Leia started to turn to the droid , hoping to politely but firmly shut him up , but Jaina 's cry stopped her abruptly and swung her back to face the screen . " Incoming ships ! " Jaina announced , her voice full of surprise . The telltale blips had appeared on her sensor viewer as if from nowhere . " Four of them , " Mara confirmed . Even as she spoke , the warning buzzers began to go off . " From Osarian . " She turned her curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ? " Leia nodded . " And they know why I 've come . " " Then they should know to leave us alone , " Jaina reasoned . Leia nodded again , but understood better . She had come to the system not to meet with the Osarians -- not at first , at least -- but with their principal rival , Nom Anor , the cult figure stirring up trouble on Rhommamool . " Tell them to back off , " she instructed Mara . " Politely ? " Mara asked , smiling , and with that dangerous twinkle in her eyes . " New Republic shuttle , " a halting voice crackled over the comm . " This is Captain Grappa of Osarian First-Force . " With a flick of a switch , Mara put an image of the captain on the viewscreen , and Leia sighed as the green skin , spiny head ridge , and tapirlike snout came into view . " Wonderful , " she remarked sarcastically . " The Osarians have hired Rodians ? " Jaina asked . " Nothing like a few mercenaries to quiet things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear me , " C-3PO remarked , and he shuffled aside nervously . " You come with us , " Grappa insisted , his multifaceted eyes sparkling eagerly . " To Osa-Prime . " " Seems the Osarians want to talk with you first , " Mara said . " They 're afraid that my meeting with Nom Anor will only heighten his stature , both among the Rhommamoolians and throughout the sector , " Leia reasoned , a notion not without credence , and one that she had debated endlessly before making the decision to come here . " Whatever the reason , they 're closing fast , " Mara replied . Both she and Jaina looked to Leia for instructions , for while the Jade Sabre was Mara 's ship , this was Leia 's mission . " Princess Leia ? " an obviously alarmed C-3PO asked . Leia sat down in the chair behind Mara , intently studying the screen , which Jaina had switched back to a normal space view . The four approaching fighters were clearly visible . " Lose them , " she said determinedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear twice . Indeed , Mara had been eager to put the shuttle , with its powerful twin engines and state-of-the-art maneuvering systems , through a real test . Green eyes sparkling , smile wide , Mara reached for the controls , but then retracted her hands and put them on her lap . " You heard her , Jaina , " she said . Jaina 's mouth dropped open ; so did Leia 's . " You mean it ? " Jaina asked . Mara 's only reply was an almost bored expression , along with a slight yawn , as if this whole thing was no big deal , and certainly nothing that Jaina could n't easily handle . " Yes ! " Jaina whispered , clenching her fists , wearing a smile nearly wide enough to take in her ears . She rubbed her hands together , then reached out to the right , rolling her fingers over the floating-ball control of the inertial compensator . " Strap in , " she ordered , and she dialed it down to 95 percent , as fighter pilots often did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of their ships . Reading the g 's , Jaina had heard it called , and she always preferred flying that way , where fast turns and mighty acceleration could push her back in her seat . " Not too much , " Leia said with concern . But her daughter was in her element now , Leia knew , and she 'd push the shuttle to its limits . Leia felt the lean as Jaina veered right , angling away from the approaching ships . " If you run , we shoot you down ! " came the uneven voice of Grappa . " Z-95 Headhunters , " Mara said derisively of the closing craft , an antiquated starfighter , and she flipped off the comm switch and looked back at Leia . " Ca n't shoot what you ca n't catch , " she explained . " Kick them in , " she added to Jaina , motioning to the primary thrusters , thinking that a burst of the powerful engines would shoot the Jade Sabre right past the befuddled Rodians and their outdated starfighters . Even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensors , streaking out from the shadows around Rhommamool , angling right in line with the Jade Sabre . " Mara , " Leia said with concern . At that , Mara did reach for the controls . But only for a moment , and then she looked Jaina right in the eye and nodded for the young woman to proceed . Leia lurched forward in her seat , held back only by the belt , as Jaina reversed throttle and kicked the etheric rudder right . There came a metallic thump behind them -- C-3PO hitting the wall , Leia guessed . Even as the Jade Sabre came to a sudden halt , nose turned starboard , Jaina pumped it out to full throttle and kicked the rudder back to the left , then hard right , fishtailing the ship about in a brutal one-eighty , then working the rudder hard and somewhat choppy in straightening out her direct retreat . As they turned , a laser cannon blast cut across their bow . " All right , the first four are on our tail , " Mara instructed calmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shields easily held back . " Try a --  " Mara started to say , but she lost the words , and nearly her lunch , as Jaina pulled a snap roll right , and then another right behind it . " Oh , we 'll be killed ! " came C-3PO 's cry from the doorway , and Leia managed to turn her head to see the droid leaning in against the metal jamb , and then to see him fly away , with a pitiful cry , as Jaina kicked the etheric rudder again , putting the ship into another sudden fishtail . A pair of Headhunters streaked past the viewscreen , but just for a split second , for Jaina vectored away at a different angle , and at single-engine full throttle , pressing Leia back in her seat . Leia wanted to say something to Jaina then , some words of encouragement or advice , but found her words stuck in her throat . And not for any g forces . It was the sight of Jaina , the fire in her brown eyes , the determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment , Leia knew . Her daughter was a woman now , and with all the grit of her father and mother combined . Mara glanced over her right shoulder , between Jaina and Leia , and both followed her lead long enough to see that two of the initial four had altered course accordingly and were fast closing , laser cannons blasting away . " Hold on , " a confident Jaina warned , and she pulled back the stick , lifting the Jade Sabre 's nose , then shoved it forward , dropping the shuttle into a sudden , inverted loop . " We 're doomed ! " C-3PO cried from the hallway -- the hallway ceiling , Leia knew . Halfway around , Jaina broke the loop with a snap roll , then kicked her into a fishtail and a barrel roll , bringing her about to nearly their original course , but with the initial four behind them . Now she did kick in both ion drives , as if to use sheer speed to split the gap between the two incoming fighters . Both angled out suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but giving them a longer shooting angle at the shuttle , and an easier turn to pursue . " They 're good , " Mara warned , but , like Leia , she found her words lost in her throat , as Jaina , teeth gritted to fight back the g 's , reversed throttle . " Princess --  " The plaintive cry from the corridor ended abruptly in a loud crash . " Coming in hot ! " Mara cried , noting the fighter fast approaching to port . Jaina did n't , could n't even hear her ; she had turned inward now , was feeling the Force coursing through her , was registering every movement of her enemies and reacting instinctively , playing the game three moves ahead . Before Mara had even begun to speak , Jaina had hit the forward attitude adjustment jets , lifting the nose , then she pumped the throttle and kicked the rudder , lifting the Jade Sabre and bringing her nose about to starboard , to directly face the other incoming Headhunter . And that eager Rodian did come in at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array screeched and lit up , warning of a lock-on . " Jaina ! " Leia cried . " He 's got us ! " Mara added . But then the closer ship , coming from port , passed right under the Jade Sabre , and Jaina fired the repulsorlifts , bouncing the Jade Sabre up and sending the poor Headhunter into a wild , spinning roll . The closing ship from starboard let fly its concussion missile , but it , and the Headhunter , zipped right underneath the elevated Jade Sabre . Before the three women could even begin to catch their breath , another ship streaked in , an X-wing , the new XJ version of the starfighter , its own laser cannons blasting away from its wingtips . Not at the Jade Sabre , though , but at the Headhunter that had just gone past . " Who is that ? " Leia asked , and Jaina , equally curious , brought the Jade Sabre about hard . The Headhunter snap-rolled left and dived , but the far superior X-wing stayed on her , lasers scoring hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart into a million pieces . " A Jedi , " Mara and Jaina said together , and Leia , when she paused to collect the Force sensations about her , concurred . " Fast to the Mediator , " Leia instructed her daughter , and Jaina swung the Jade Sabre about yet again . " I did n't know there were any Jedi in the sector , " Leia said to Mara , who could only shrug , equally at a loss . " Another one 's out , " Jaina informed them , watching the blips on her sensor screen . " And two others are vectoring away . " " They want no part of a Jedi showing a willingness to shoot back , " Mara remarked . " Maybe Rodians are smarter than I thought , " Leia said dryly . " Smooth it out , " she instructed her daughter , unbuckling and climbing unsteadily to her feet . Jaina reluctantly dialed the inertial compensator back to full . " Only one pursuing , " Jaina informed them as Leia made her way to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leia nodded . In the hallway outside the bridge , Leia found C-3PO inverted and against the wall , his feet sticking up in the air , his head crunched forward so that his chin was tight against his chest . " You have to learn to hold on , " Leia said to him , helping him upright . She glanced across the way to Bolpuhr as she spoke , to find the Noghri still standing calmly in the exact spot she had assigned him . Somehow , she was n't amazed . Jaina took the Jade Sabre at a swift but steady pace toward the distant Mediator . She checked often for pursuit , but it quickly became obvious that the Rodians in their outdated Headhunters wanted no part of this fight . Leia rejoined them a short while later , to find Jaina in complete control and Mara resting back in her seat , eyes closed . Even when Jaina asked her aunt a question about docking procedures , the woman did n't respond , did n't even open her eyes . " They 'll guide you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from the Mediator crackled over the opened comm , giving explicit directions for entry vector . Jaina took her in , and Jaina took her down , easily -- and after the display of flying she had just given them out with the Headhunters , Leia was n't the least bit surprised by her ability to so smoothly tight-dock a ship as large as the Jade Sabre . That final shudder as Jaina eased off the repulsorlifts and settled the shuttle onto the docking bay floor stirred Mara from her rest . She opened her eyes and , seeing where they were , rose quickly . And then she swayed and seemed as if she would fall . Leia and Jaina were there in an instant , catching and steadying her . She regained her balance and took a deep breath . " Maybe next time you can dial down the inertial compensator to ninety-seven instead of ninety-five , " she said jokingly , straining a smile . Jaina laughed , but Leia 's face showed her deep concern . " Are you all right ? " she asked . Mara eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can rest , " Leia said . " Where we all can rest , " Mara corrected , and her tone told Leia to back off , a reminder that Leia was intruding on a private place for Mara , a place she had explicitly instructed all of her friends , even her husband , not to go . This disease was Mara 's fight alone , to Mara 's thinking , a battle that had forced her to reconsider everything she thought about her life , past , present , and future , and everything she thought about death . Leia held her stare for a moment longer , but replaced her own concerned expression with one of acceptance . Mara did not want to be coddled or cuddled . She was determined to live on in an existence that did not name her disease as the most pressing and important facet of her entire life , to live on as she had before , with the illness being relegated to the position of nuisance , and nothing more . Of course , Leia understood it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mara to spend hours and tremendous Force energy merely holding it in check . But that was Mara 's business . " I hope to meet with Nom Anor tomorrow , " Leia explained , as the three , with C-3PO and Bolpuhr in tow , headed for the lower hatch , then moved down to the landing bay . A contingent of New Republic Honor Guard stood waiting there , along with Commander Ackdool , a Mon Calamarian with large , probing eyes , a fishlike face , and salmon-colored skin . " By all reports , we should all be rested before dealing with him . " " Believe those reports , " Mara said . " And first , it seems I get to meet with our savior Jedi , " Leia added dryly , looking back behind the Jade Sabre to see the X-wing gliding in to rest . " Wurth Skidder , " Jaina remarked , recognizing the markings under the canopy on the starfighter . " Why am I not surprised ? " Leia asked , and she blew a sigh . Ackdool came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the distinguished guests , but Leia 's reaction set him back on his heels -- indeed , it raised more than a few eyebrows among the members of the Mediator 's Honor Guard . " Why did you send him out ? " Leia snapped , motioning toward the docking X-wing . Commander Ackdool started to answer , but Leia continued . " If we had needed assistance , we would have called for it . " " Of course , Princess Leia , " Commander Ackdool said with a polite bow . " They why send him out ? " " Why do you assume that Wurth Skidder flew out at my command ? " the cool Commander Ackdool dared to respond . " Why would you assume that Wurth Skidder heeds any order I might give ? " " Couple o ' ridge-head parachutes floating over Osarian , if those Rodians had any luck , " came the singsong voice of Wurth Skidder . The cocky young man was fast approaching , pulling off his helmet and giving his shock of blond hair a tousle as he walked . Leia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no better reason than to make the Jedi stop short . " Wurth Skidder , " she said . " Princess , " the man replied with a bow . " Did you have a little fun out there ? " " More than a little , " the Jedi said with a wide grin and a sniffle -- and he always seemed to be sniffling , and his hair always looked as if he had just walked in from a Tatooine sandstorm . " Fun for me , I mean , and not for the Rodians . " " And the cost of your fun ? " Leia asked . That took the smile from Wurth Skidder 's face , and he looked at Leia curiously , obviously not understanding . " The cost , " Leia explained . " What did your little excursion cost ? " " A couple of proton torpedos , " Wurth replied with a shrug . " A little fuel . " " And a year of diplomatic missions to calm down the Osarians , " Leia retorted . " But they shot first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stupidity likely escalated an already impossible situation ? " Leia 's voice was as firm and cold as anyone present had ever heard it . So cold , in fact , that the always overprotective Bolpuhr , fearing trouble , glided closer to her , hanging back just behind her left shoulder , within fast striking distance of the Jedi . " They were attacking you , " Wurth Skidder retorted . " Six of them ! " " They were trying to bring us down to Osarian , " Leia harshly explained . " A not-so-unexpected response , given my announced intentions here . And so we planned to avoid them . Avoid ! Do you understand that word ? " Wurth Skidder said nothing . " Avoid them and thus cause no further problems or hard feelings , " Leia went on . " And so we would have , and we would have asked for no explanations from Shunta Osarian Dharrg , all of us pretending that nothing had ever happened . " " But --  " " And our graciousness in not mentioning this unfortunate incident would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of conciliation from Osarian toward Rhommamool , " Leia continued , anger creeping in thicker with each word . " But now we ca n't do that , can we ? Now , so that Wurth Skidder could paint another skull on the side of his X-wing , I 'll have to deal with an incident . " " They shot first , " Wurth Skidder reiterated when it became apparent that Leia was done . " And better that they had shot last , " Leia replied . " And if Shunta Osarian Dharrg demands reparations , we 'll agree , with all apologies , and any monies to be paid will come from Wurth Skidder 's private funds . " The Jedi squared his shoulders at the suggestion , but then Leia hit him with a sudden and devastating shot . " My brother will see to it . " Wurth Skidder bowed again , glared at Leia and all around , then turned on his heel and walked briskly away . " My apologies , Princess Leia , " Ackdool said . " But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a blessing when he arrived two weeks ago . His Jedi skills should certainly come in handy against any terrorist attempts -- and we have heard rumors of many -- against the Mediator . " " And you are indeed within striking distance of surface missiles , " C-3PO added , but he stopped short , this time catching on to the many disapproving looks that came his way . " I did not know that Jedi Skidder would prove so ... " Ackdool paused , searching for the right word . " Intractable . " " Stubborn , you mean , " Leia said . As they all started away , Leia did manage a bit of a smile when she heard Mara behind her tell Jaina , " Maybe Nom Anor has met his match . " C-9PO , a protocol droid , its copper coloring tinged red from the constantly blowing dusts of Rhommamool , skittered down an alley to the side of the main avenue of Redhaven and peeked out cautiously at the tumult beyond . The fanatical followers of Nom Anor , the Red Knights of Life , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an apparent purge of landspeeders on their tutakans , eight-legged lizards with enormous tusks that climbed right up past their black eyes and curled in like white eyebrows . " Ride the beasts given by Life ! " one Red Knight screamed at a poor civilian as the wrinkled Dressellian merchant was dragged from the cockpit and punched and pushed to the ground . " Perversion ! " several other Red Knights cried in unison . " Life-pretender ! " And they set upon the landspeeder with their tubal-iron pummelstaves , smashing the windshield , bashing in the side moldings , crushing the steering wheel and other controls , even knocking one of the rear drive 's cylindrical engines from its mounts . Satisfied that the craft was wrecked beyond repair , they pulled the Dressellian to his feet and shoved him to and fro , warning him to ride creatures , not machines -- or , better still , to use the legs that nature had provided and walk . Then they beat him back down to the ground and moved on , some climbing back atop the tutakans , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had only a couple of repulsors still firing . It looked more like a twisted lump of beaten metal than a vehicle , tilting to one side because of the unequal weight distribution and the weakened lift capacity . " Oh , dear me , " the protocol droid said , ducking low as the contingent stormed past . Tap , tap , tap came the ringing of metal on metal against the top of the droid 's head . C-9PO slowly turned about and saw the fringe of the telltale black capes , and the red-dyed hides . With a screech , the droid stood up and tried to run away , but a pummelstave smashed in the side of his leg and he went facedown in the red dust . He lifted his head , but rising up on his arms only gave the two Red Knights a better handhold as they walked past , each scooping the droid under one shoulder and dragging him along . " Got a Ninepio , " one of the pair called out to his lizard-riding buddies , and a cheer went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square of Hopeful Redemption . C-9PO was glad that he was n't programmed to experience pain . " It was a stupid thing to do , " Leia said firmly . " Wurth thought he was helping us , " Jaina reminded , but Leia was n't buying that argument . " Wurth was trying to find his own thrills , " she corrected . " And that hotshot attitude of his will reinforce the ring of truth to Nom Anor 's diatribes against the Jedi , " Mara said . " He 's not without followers on Osarian . " As she finished , she looked down at the table , at the pile of leaflets Commander Ackdool had given them , colorful propaganda railing against the New Republic , against the Jedi , and against anything mechanical and technological , and somehow tying all of these supposed ills to the cultural disease that engulfed the society of the planet Osarian . " Why does Nom Anor hate the Jedi ? " Jaina asked . " What do we have to do with the struggle between Osarian and Rhommamool ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 'd be coming here . " " The Jedi have nothing to do with this struggle , " Leia replied . " Or at least , they did n't until Wurth Skidder 's antics . " " Nom Anor hates the New Republic , " Mara added . " And he hates the Jedi as symbols of the New Republic . " " Is there anything Nom Anor does n't hate ? " Leia asked dryly . " Do n't take him lightly , " Mara warned yet again . " His religious cry to abandon technology and machines , to look for truth in the natural elements and life of the universe , and to resist the joining of planets in false confederations resonates deeply in many people , particularly those who have been the victims of such planetary alliances , like the miners of Rhommamool . " Leia did n't disagree . She had spent many hours before and during the journey here reading the history of the two planets , and she knew that the situation on Rhommamool was much more complicated than that . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet voluntarily , there were quite a number who were the descendants of the original " colonists "  - -  involuntary immigrants sent there to work the mines because of high crimes they had committed . Whatever the truth of the situation , though , Leia could n't deny that Rhommamool was the perfect breeding ground for zealots like Nom Anor . Life there was tough -- even basics like water could be hard to come by -- while the prosperous Osarians lived in comfort on white sandy beaches and crystal-clear lakes . " I still do n't understand how any of that concerns the Jedi , " Jaina remarked . " Nom Anor was stirring up anger against the Jedi long before he ever came to Rhommamool , " Mara explained . " Here , he 's just found a convenient receptacle for his wrath . " " And with the Jedi Knights scattered throughout the galaxy , and so many of them following their own agendas , Nom Anor might just find plenty of ammunition to add to his arguments , " Leia added grimly . " I 'm glad that my brother is thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jaina seemed less convinced . " Jacen does n't think that 's such a good idea , " she reminded her mother . Leia shrugged . Her oldest son , Jaina 's twin , had indeed expressed serious doubts about the course of the Jedi Knights . " If we ca n't bring some sense of order to the galaxy , particularly to isolated planets like Osarian and Rhommamool , then we 're no better than the Empire , " Mara remarked . " We 're better than the Empire , " Leia insisted . " Not in Nom Anor 's eyes , " Jaina said . And Mara reiterated her warning to Leia not to take the man lightly . " He 's the strangest man I ever met , " she explained , and given her past exploits with notorious sorts like Jabba the Hutt and Talon Karrde , that was quite a statement . " Even when I tried to use the Force to gain a better perspective on him , I drew ... " Mara paused , as if looking for some way to properly express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As if the Force had nothing to do with him . " Leia and Jaina looked at her curiously . " No , " Mara corrected . " More like he had nothing to do with the Force . " The perfect disconnected ideologue , Leia thought , and she expressed her feelings with a single sarcastic word : " Wonderful . " He stood on the platform surrounded by his fanatical Red Knights . Before him , ten thousand Rhommamoolians crowded into every open space of the great public square of Redhaven , once the primary trading spaceport of the planet . But those facilities had been leveled in the early days of the uprising , with the Rhommamoolians declaring their independence from Osarian . And more recently , since the coming of Nom Anor as spearhead of the revolution , the place had been renamed the Square of Hopeful Redemption . Here , the citizens came to declare freedom from Osarian . Here , the followers came to renounce the New Republic . Here , the believers came to renounce the Jedi . And here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a simpler time , when the strength of a being 's legs , and not the weight of his purse , determined how far he could travel , and the strength of his hands , and not the weight of his purse , allowed him to harvest the gifts of nature . Nom Anor loved it all , the adulation and the fanatical , bordering on suicidal , devotion . He cared nothing for Rhommamool or its inhabitants , cared nothing for the foolish cries for some ridiculous " simpler time . " But how he loved the chaos his words and followers inflicted upon the order of the galaxy . How he loved the brooding undercurrent of resentment toward the New Republic , and the simmering anger aimed at the Jedi Knights , these supercreatures of the galaxy . Would n't his superiors be pleased ? Nom Anor flipped his shiny black cape back from his shoulder and held his fist upraised into the air , drawing shrieks of appreciation . In the center of the square , where once had stood the Portmaster 's Pavilion , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten deep . Whistles and whines emanated from that pit , along with cries for mercy and pitifully polite words of protest -- the voices of droids collected by the folk of Rhommamool and dropped into the hole . Great cheers erupted from all corners of the square as a pair of the Red Knights entered from one avenue , dragging a 9PO protocol droid between them . They went to the edge of the pit , took up the poor 9PO by the arms and the legs , and on a three-count , launched him onto the pile of metal consisting of the astromech and mine-sniffer droids , the Redhaven street-cleaner droids , and the personal butler droids of the wealthier Rhommamoolian citizens . When the hooting and cheering died down , Nom Anor opened his hands , revealing a single small stone . Then he clenched his fist again , squeezing with tremendous power , crushing the stone in his grasp so that dust and flecks of rock splinters slipped out the sides . The signal to begin . As one the crowd surged forward , lifting great chunks of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came to the edge of the pit one after another and hurled their heavy missiles at the pile of droids . The stoning went on for the rest of the afternoon , until the red glare of the sun thinned to a brilliant crimson line along the horizon , until the dozens and dozens of droids were no more than scrap metal and sparking wires . And Nom Anor , silent and dignified , watched it all somberly , accepting this great tribute his followers had paid to him , this public execution of the hated droids .
