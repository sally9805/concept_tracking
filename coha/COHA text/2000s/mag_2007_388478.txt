Castner lives in Las Vegas , Nev . The human-resources recruiter at the hospital in western New York was confused . " You live in Las Vegas now ? " she asked . " Yes , that 's right , " my wife said . " And you 're moving here ? " It was not the first time my wife , an emergency-room nurse trying to set up interviews for a new job in a new city , has had to explain herself . Perhaps the time of year explains the recruiter 's confusion  --  she was probably buried under a late-winter blizzard , dreaming of our sunny weather . Thousands of people move to Las Vegas each month . No one moves from the sun belt to the snow belt . No one , that is , except us . I 'm also surprised about our coming move . Born and raised in Buffalo , N.Y. , I spent my first 18 years trying to leave . My hometown was too small , too predictable and too boring , filled with similarly small , predictable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's family in Oregon , I dreamed of permanently moving out west . I was drawn to the sense of optimism and the broad Western landscapes . Back east I felt doomed to the opposite ; gray , snowy winters that seemed to never end . My mother 's family had lived in Buffalo for nearly 150 years , and no one ever escaped . When college came , I grabbed my chance , went to school in Milwaukee ( far , but not too far ) , got married ( to a girl from Michigan , not Buffalo ) , joined the Air Force and did n't look back . The few friends from high school I kept in touch with all moved away : to New York City , Boston , California . In the military I met many others from my hometown . All told the same story of the desire to escape . We joked that Buffalo was a better place to be from than to actually be . In the past eight years , I have lived in South Dakota , New Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Kyrgyzstan . The strain of constant deployments has taken its toll on my family , and my Air Force career is now drawing to a close , which means we can decide for ourselves where to move . My wife and I made a list of priorities . After years of brown landscapes , we longed for trees , grass and water . We wanted to move east , and north ; someplace with four seasons . We liked the idea of a university town , where we could get our Ph.D . ' s and maybe teaching jobs later . Our new hometown needed to have affordable housing  --  the boom of Las Vegas had left us barely able to afford a too-small house there . Also on the list were good schools for our three sons , and easy access to their grandparents . Plus rolling hills for cross-country skiing for me ; a body of water for kayaking and sailing for my wife . After eight years of following my job , we wanted to follow our life . As we brainstormed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , Albany , Minneapolis  --  nothing seemed quite right . Finally one day my wife said , " Stop being so stubborn . You know Buffalo has everything that we 're looking for . " But I worried I would be judged a failure for moving back . Did it mean I could n't hack it on the " outside " ? But the idea of making my old hometown my new address began growing on me . The more I thought about it , the more I realized that moving back will hold benefits far eclipsing our meager list . My sons will get the chance to grow up with not only their grandparents , but great-grandmother , great-great aunts and first , second and third cousins . They 'll get to hear family stories about their grandfather , a firefighter , who put out a blaze in the church his grandfather built . My sons will go to my old high school . These ideas suddenly held meaning . Marriage , fatherhood and deployments to the worst areas of the world have given me a perspective I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large supporting family and sense of community history most people do n't have . I appreciate it only now . But I understand that I am not settling for an easier road , but rather making an active choice to believe in the place my immigrant ancestors poured their lives into . I am learning to be less defensive when admitting I am moving back home . I tell people we thought objectively , and Buffalo just happened to have all the things we were looking for . When I tell my high-school friends I am moving back , they say " good for you , " as in " you 're braver than I. " When I tell my military friends from Buffalo , they say they have seen too much of the world to move back to that small , predictable , boring town . I tell them I have seen too much in this world not to move home .
