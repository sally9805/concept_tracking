Chapter One When Sean McIntyre first saw her , his sex drive let out an endless , shuddering wolf whistle . One that would 've brought down the high-rise building if Los Angeles had n't been so strict about fortifying the place against occasional earthquakes . Or another natural disaster trigger like his new coworker . He settled back in his leather office chair , just taking in the show , a grin easing over his mouth as she leaned against the door frame . All long legs , curves and catnip . Dark gypsy hair waved softly past her shoulders , matching the black smoke of her eyes . She aimed a lowered gaze at him , the tips of her red lips swooping upward in a gesture more suited to a wet dream than the business offices of Stellar Public Relations , Incorporated . Sean raised an eyebrow , amused . Intrigued . But , as usual , Louis Martin screwed up the moment , bursting past the woman in a flutter of kinetic overload . " There she is . Did n't know where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " One second I 'm giving you the tour , the next you 're ... " The woman interrupted him with one sultry glance . Louis almost fell backward from the force of it . " Sorry , " she said , her voice as thick and slow as honey dripping from a fingertip . She nodded toward the window while returning her gaze to Sean . " I prefer the view in this office . " He bit back a laugh . Cheeky . Already he liked her . Already he wanted to peel off that slightly seethrough , butterfly-sleeved red suit that pushed the limits of professional wear . Sharp , flashy , powerful . All the things a PR representative should be . And then some . Louis fidgeted with his tie . " The view . Right . Your office 'll be down the hall though . " Time to open his mouth , Sean supposed . " This is my lion 's den . Not fit for a lady . " " No wonder I feel right at home . " She flashed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thirty-two-year-old schoolboy with a hard-on . Should he grab a textbook and hide behind it while he got to his feet to shake hands ? No English Lit or Trig tomes available , you say ? Then maybe he could just stay seated and zoom his wheeled office chair on over to her , introducing himself as half the cad he actually was . That 's right . A gentleman would stand up , take a woman 's hand , pay her proper respect . But gentlemen probably refrained from popping wood the second a beautiful female came within range . He flicked a manila folder off the desk to his lap - the better to fool you with , my dear - and performed the chair slide . But his cautious move did n't throw her off , not if that knowing gleam in her eyes was any indication . What the hell , thought Sean . He grinned as he stood , flipping aside the folder , extending his hand . " Sean McIntyre . " The woman perused his outstretched palm , her gaze slipping to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lazy grin . She knew he was turned on . Not that it made her a genius . She tucked her fingers into his hand , sliding a nail along his thumb in a wickedly disguised shake . " Fiona Cruz . Pleased to meet you . " Cruz . The name rang an alarm . He 'd heard of her successes as a marketing machine for actors . She was good . Damned good . But had n't there been some hint of scandal surrounding her ... ? Time seemed to furl around itself as their skin pulsed with the contact , touches languishing , almost as if both of them wanted to see who would let go first . Louis 's voice sawed apart their grip , but not their sustained eye contact . " We brought on Fiona because she 's gangbusters . " Sean coolly acknowledged the weasel 's remark . This introduction was Louis 's way of turning on the burner under Sean 's chair , was n't it ? " Got that covered , Martie , " he said , knowing the nickname would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks reddened . " It 's Louis . As in Martin . " Fiona Cruz had started to wander around Sean 's office , trailing her hand over the rigid , metal bookshelves , the writhing steel sculpture in the corner . A flame in the center of a frozen twist of furniture . He could n't help admiring her beautiful ass , wanting to cup the curves of it , rocking her against his groin , feeling every voluptuous inch of her opening for him .... " McIntyre ? " Louis again . " What ? " " Fiona 's brought her rising star with her to the firm . Lincoln Castle . " Sean blanched . " The soap star ? That Lincoln Castle ? " As Fiona stopped by the window , which overlooked Wilshire Boulevard with its palm trees and summer-in-the-city streets , she tossed her words over a shoulder . " There 's only one man with a name that ... singular . " Rage kicked him into gear , forcing his footsteps over to Louis , where he shadowed the boss with his height . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is connected to my new client ? " Louis shrugged . " Of course . Say , McIntyre , I 've got a conference call with Edgar Lux and his publishing house . Can you show Fiona to her office when she 's ready ? " Then he lowered his voice . " That is , unless she gets comfortable in your chair . " Rather than saying something that would cause Louis to fly into a fit , Sean kept his mouth shut , electing instead to usher his boss from the room with a thanks-a-lot glare . Louis dashed away , leaving Sean alone with a woman who could very well be the end of his career at Stellar . If you could call it a career anymore . He turned his attention to Fiona , trying to focus his anger . But he was distracted by the way her dress caught the sun through its sheer material , a dreamcatcher winding darker hopes through the threads of red while allowing fantasies to pass through . " Let me guess , " she said , her back still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guy 's harmless , unless you do n't know how to play office politics . " She turned around with a smile , leaning against the window frame , shifting the sunlight and blinding him with another jab of pure lust . " I know how to play , " she said . " Do you ? " He could n't hold back a sardonic laugh . Another sweeping gaze over that jazz-baby body . " Listen , Ms. Cruz - " " Call me Fiona . " " Fiona . " The purr of her name caught in his throat . A professional-suicide hairball . ( Continues ... )
