<p> BATON ROUGE  --  In an era when Big State U. often has just a few players from the immediate area , LSU has taken its home-court advantage to another level . <p> The 17th-ranked Tigers , who open play Friday in the Southeastern Conference tournament in Nashville , are about as local as it gets : The top six , by minutes per game , come from within an hour of campus . <p> The only senior , guard Darrel Mitchell , is from St. Martinville , 60 miles away . Three other starters  --  forward Glen " Big Baby " Davis , guard Garrett Temple and forward Tyrus Thomas  --  are from Baton Rouge . Forward Tasmin Mitchell ( no relation ) is from suburban Denham Springs , and top reserve Darnell Lazare is from Baton Rouge . <p> What 's more , Davis , Temple , Thomas and Tasmin Mitchell have competed with or against each other since they were youngsters , even combining to win an AAU national championship as 15-year-olds . <p> " When you look at our starting lineup and see everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something you do n't see a lot of in America , " says backup point guard Ben Voogd , a freshman from Florence , Ore . <p> Voogd and freshman forward Magnum Rolle of the Bahamas are the only non-Louisianans who see court time on a team that won the SEC regular season with a 14-2 record and went 22-7 overall . LSU lost five non-conference games by a total of 11 points , including by two at No.7 Ohio State and one point at top-ranked Connecticut . <p> The Louisianans have scored 95% of the points , giving LSU the greatest percentage of points from players within 60 miles of campus of any team in the six major conferences . <p> " I think they have a comfort zone in terms of personalities , where they understand each other and there 's no friction ever , " LSU coach John Brady says . " Sometimes I think they 're disagreeing with one another too much and they say , ' Coach , that 's OK . We 've done this for years . ' I have to back off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other . " <p> Baton Rouge has long been a hotbed of hoops , starting with LSU Hall of Famer Bob Petit . The list includes longtime NBA player and coach Don Chaney , who starred at Houston , and Keith Smart , who hit the game-winning shot for Indiana in the 1987 NCAA title game . <p> But the LSU story line goes deeper at a school that this season became the first in SEC history to win the men 's and women 's regular-season titles in the same year . <p> Brandon Bass , who left LSU for the NBA after his sophomore year last season , was the SEC player of the year . This season sophomore Davis is the league MVP . In women 's basketball , senior Seimone Augustus was last year 's national player of the year . All three are from Baton Rouge  --  Bass and Augustus are products of Capitol High School , and Davis went to University High on the LSU campus . <p> " It shows how much talent we have in the area and how much we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who replaced Dale Brown nine years ago , grew up an LSU football fan in McComb , Miss. , less than 100 miles from Baton Rouge . Brady started his basketball coaching career at Crowley ( La . ) High in the southwest part of the state and was an assistant at the University of New Orleans . <p> He 's a big fan of Louisiana basketball . " I think it translates into your fans having a deeper connection , maybe , having seen ( the Tigers ) play in high school and now at LSU , " says Brady , the SEC coach of the year . <p> " I 've always thought that if you could ever get the best players from Louisiana , or at least the majority of them , you could certainly have a good basketball team . That 's not saying that we do n't go after talented players that are n't from Louisiana or this area , but certainly we 'd like to start here with this as our recruiting base . <p> " But I do n't know of any other team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with players from as close by as this , " Brady adds . " We have good high school coaching in this <p> Darrel Mitchell , a 5-11 sharpshooter with remarkable quickness , played for his dad at St. Martinville High . LSU 's all-time leader in three-point field goals ( 248 ) , he is an all-SEC first-team guard this season after averaging 17.6 points and leading LSU in assists ( 132 ) , steals ( 59 ) and three-pointers ( 72-for-172 , 41.9% ) . Mitchell has also hit 74% from the free throw line . <p> " For us to do this with all these in-state guys and four of them from Baton Rouge , it makes the season even better , " Mitchell says . <p> Lazare ( averaging 6.5 points , 3.4 rebounds ) is a junior from Baton Rouge 's Woodlawn High , where he won two state titles . He 's the first Tiger off the bench . <p> " I knew this was possible , " Lazare says . " Louisiana has been a hot spot for high school basketball , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college basketball players . I knew here we would do something special . It was just a matter of time . " <p> Davis is a 6-9 , 310-pound power forward who leads the SEC in rebounds ( 9.9 a game ) and is second in scoring ( 18.3 points ) , showing his tenacity and quickness despite being the ultimate wide body . <p> Thomas and Temple are redshirt freshmen who have been teammates since they were 3 . Thomas exploded onto the scene after taking a medical redshirt last year , becoming a crowd favorite because of his dazzling leaping ability . <p> " That helped with my knowledge of the game and my maturity on and off the court , " he says . <p> Thomas ( 12.7 points , 9.3 rebounds ) has blocked an SEC-best 82 shots this season ( tied with Arkansas ' Steven Hill ) and scored on dunks , alley-oops and put-backs . <p> Thomas missed LSU 's final two regular-season games with a sprained ankle , and Brady probably will keep him out of the SEC tournament to be at full strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , cutting and jumping , but Brady says he is taking no chances . <p> Temple was a teammate of Davis at U-High , where they won back-to-back state titles . Temple was forced into a point guard role when junior Tack Minor was lost for the year with an injury , but he has doubled as LSU 's defensive stopper . <p> Credit to Collis Temple <p> He 's also a legacy . Temple 's father , Collis Temple Jr. , was LSU 's first African-American player . His older brother , Collis III , also played at LSU ( 1999-2003 ) . Temple and Thomas played for Collis Jr . as young children . <p> Brown recalled the older Temple bringing them to his LSU basketball camp when they were 5 . " Collis Temple should really be complimented , " Brown says . " Collis Temple developed this whole thing . He brought the AAU thing together . " <p> " Even though we 're young , we 've played together so long , " Temple says . " That 's one of the things incoming freshmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teammates play . But since we played with each other for so long , it 's just an AAU game for us sometimes . An AAU game for a national championship . We 're mature beyond our years . " <p> That 's also something said about the fifth starter , Tasmin Mitchell ( 11.4 points , 5.4 rebounds ) . The freshman forward with guard-like ballhandling skills , whose godfather is LSU associate coach Butch Pierre , is a tough defender and arguably the most fundamentally sound of all the Tigers . <p> To a man , the LSU players talk about their " team chemistry " and how much they like each other . They hang out as a team , whether it 's watching basketball or going to the mall or going out to eat . <p> " It 's all about our relationship off the court , " Tasmin Mitchell says . " I never played with Darrel Mitchell before this year , but it seems like I 've been playing with him forever . We all know what each other does ; we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outs of each other . That 's our team chemistry . " <p> Davis says it is evident on the court . <p> " There was a time , " he said after LSU beat Mississippi last Saturday to end the regular season , " when Garrett had the ball and I just knew he was going to go to the rack , so I went to the rim . Little things like that . I knew if I stood in the right place , he would see me . And he passed me the ball . The little things you ca n't teach . " <p> Temple and Davis always played AAU basketball for Temple 's father . For big tournaments , Thomas and Tasmin Mitchell would join them . In addition to winning a national title at 15 , the players finished second as 13- and 16-year-olds . <p> The local list could have been longer . Baton Rougean Kentrell Gransberry , a junior college transfer and prep teammate of Lazare 's , inexplicably quit the team in December and transferred to South Florida . <p> Early Doucet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said to be the best player of the bunch when they were 12 and 13 . Instead , Doucet is a wide receiver for the LSU football team ; he gave up basketball after his junior year after having played with Temple and Davis as a youngster . <p> " It 's basically Louisiana kids , " says Pierre , a product of nearby Darrow who played at Mississippi State and is regarded as one of the nation 's top recruiters . " If you can sign the top two or three Louisiana kids every year , you should be able to finish in the top two or three in this league . " <p> Then there 's Magnum Rolle ( named by his mother , a huge fan of Tom Selleck and TV 's Magnum P.I. ) , from Freeport , Bahamas , by way of Laurinburg ( N.C. ) Prep . " The guys from here accepted the out-of-towners and made us feel at home , which made the transition much easier for us , " Rolle says . <p> Twenty-five years ago , Brown took LSU to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 team became the lowest-seeded team ( No. 11 ) to reach a Final Four . Both squads were top-heavy with Louisianans , and each had key players from Baton Rouge . <p> " I 'm really the happiest guy in the world inside because I know what these kind of things can mean to these young men if they progress and if they move in the direction of becoming responsible adults in this community , " Temple Jr . says . " I know what this really can mean to them . And it 's really more about life as a responsible adult than basketball at LSU . <p> " But this is great . "
