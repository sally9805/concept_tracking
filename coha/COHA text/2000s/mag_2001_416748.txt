With a few simple steps , you can refresh your spirit and reclaim your zest for life // MAYBE it hits you when you realize that things that once made you happy just do n't bring joy anymore . Or maybe it strikes you as you repeat for the 500th time the same day-in , day-out grind of working hard , cooking dinner and sleeping . This may not be another case of the blahs . Something deep inside may be telling you it 's time to make some changes . Experts say you should surrender to that calling and take back your life . Now , they say , is the time to rediscover the real you , the one you lost some time between the senior prom and your first job , the one smiling in the pictures , the one who was the life of the party , and always the pride of the family . Now is the time to place personal troubles and the pressures of life as far away as possible , and fall in love with yourself and your world all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jakes and Iyanla Vanzant are all sending the same message : Seize the moment . The key to reclaiming yourself is to become your biggest cheerleader , says the Rev. John Mann , director of student affairs and a faculty member at the Inner Visions Institute for Spiritual Development in Silver Spring , Md. , which was founded by Vanzant . Photograph Put the pep back in your step by reigniting the fire within you . Refreshing the mind , body and soul allows us to live up to our full potential and lead happier lives , experts say . // " We all need support in some way , and the greatest support is being self-supportive , " Mann says . " We all need that spirit that will allow us to follow through and be totally present and available for ourselves . " So , using the following tips , begin to take steps to rediscover yourself and be the best that you can be . TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF AND LIFE This is more than a quick and simple glance in the mirror . Examine every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else out of it . Not satisfied with the results ? It could be a sign that a rediscovery may be needed . " If your life is not working , you need to step back and ask yourself why , " says Donna Marie Williams , a Naperville , Ill. , author who wrote the books Black-Eyed Pecan for the Soul and Sensual Celibacy . " While you 're asking yourself why , stop blaming everybody else . The more people blame others , the less they 're able to face their problems . " Step back from it all , look at what you have and be prepared to make the next move . GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR SPIRITUAL SIDE Celeste Spane , director of Spane Counseling , a mental health counseling center in Phoenix , says a person should set aside quiet time each day to think about who he or she really is and what he or she wants to do . " I 'm a true believer in having some daily meditation or daily statement that you make to yourself which reflects your philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spane says . Prayer also aids the restoration of your soul . " Meditation and prayer go hand-in-hand , " Rev. Mann adds . " Be willing to surrender things to the universe and give yourself-and your connection to God-the time you need to make that connection . For me , it keeps me in a peaceful place . " Men in particular , he explains , easily lose touch with their spiritual side as they face the pressure of being leaders . " From a man 's point of view , we often feel we have to fix things or make things right in life , " he adds . " Beginning to acknowledge whose we are and that we do have a heavenly father would take off the pressure of this " doing-ness ' ' ; that we always have to do something about life or a situation . We should allow ourselves to just be or just have a balanced perspective about life . It 's not so much about doing as it is being who we are . " In some cases , it may be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author who is also a senior staff specialist at United Airlines , had reached the brink of disappointment due to failed relationships and wanted to recapture her spirit . Both fathers of her two children had already walked out on her , she says , and other relationships fared no better . Tired of the pain , Williams took the defining step and became celibate . She used the time to heal wounds and restore her soul . And , seven years later , she remains celibate . " It has taken that long to get myself together , " Williams said . " During that time , I found what a special person I am . I did n't know that . " TAKE ACTION Now that your head has cleared and you 've begun to refresh your soul , it 's time to set the wheels in motion . Develop an active plan to find and empower you . Spane stresses the importance of actually doing something . Taking action is the key , not necessarily which action you take . " When I talk to people about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck in the preliminary stage , " Spane says . " If you do n't know what to do , pick the top three things and do them . If it does n't work , do the other one . But you have to take action . You have to get out of that planning stage . " Set aside time for you-and only you-at least once per week . For those with children and multiple jobs , this may be difficult to pull off . But when it 's actually done , you come out nothing less than a winner . Williams is a prime example . She sets aside a few hours each Saturday morning to get her hair done and to get a little shopping in . " Claim three hours for yourself and do whatever you want to do , " she says . " It 's wonderful , and I turn out to be a much happier person . " Photograph Donna Marie Williams of Naperville , Ill. , grew tired of failed relationships and frustration in her life , and became celibate , she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those wounds and get her life back on track . // It also helps , experts say , to start a program of regular exercise . Engaging in physical activities boosts the body and self-esteem . " Exercise is one of the most valuable tools that we have , " Rev. Mann says . " Not only does it keep us fit physically , but also allows us to work off frustration and think things through ... You can meditate while you 're running , swimming , jogging , dancing , whatever . That also gives you a creative outlet to express yourself . " If a job situation is the source of your unhappiness , consider a career makeover . However , Spane suggests that people thoroughly explore the potential new career before actually making the move . A vacation might be the right remedy to refresh the spirit . Just make sure you can afford it . As for other drastic action , such as packing your bags and moving , Spane and Williams urge caution . " You have to decide if that 's warranted or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only you can decide , but that 's where the stepping back comes from . You think about it , you pray about it . " And , Spane adds , " Sometimes it does take something dramatic to make people change , but more often than not , it 's some little thing , some small change that you make . It can be so minute that most people wo n't even know you 've made the change . But you 'll know . " BE PREPARED TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS Nobody says it 's going to be easy , so be prepared for setbacks and trials . " I would advise anyone going through the process that , to avoid backsliding , you might have to get rid of a couple of people , " Williams says . " If that means being alone for a while , so be it , but after a time God will send you someone . Be positive . " If you still find yourself feeling blue after attempting to upgrade your life , it might be the sign of a deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes rediscovering yourself involves finding out things about yourself that may not be related to your job or career , " Spane says . " They may be related to your past or something going on with you personally . In that regard , I think a counselor would help address those kinds of issues . " ENJOY YOURSELF ALL OVER AGAIN Once you 're stepping to the rhythm of a new beat , your self  --  confidence and your life will improve dramatically , experts say . " Some of the signs are going to be peacefulness , balance in your life , health , having loving relationships , attracting people who you 're going to love and who are going to love you , " Mann says . " All of those things are going to show up in your life if you 're living up to your authentic self . " Williams , the book author , says the seven years of celibacy have been crucial to her redevelopment . Now , she says , she 's whole , and she 's ready to date again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it and that I 'm not a bad person , " Williams says . " I 'm actually a good person with a good heart . Now I can look at exploring the heart side of my life again ... I look back on that Donna back then , and I feel so much for her . But I 'm not that same person anymore . " Do n't think that the road to rediscovery ends just because you 've successfully completed one trip . Rediscovering the real you is a continuing journey . " Self-discovery is an ongoing process , " Spane says . " A lot of people think , " I 'll reinvent myself and that will be that . ' No , you 'll reinvent yourself and , later , you 'll reinvent yourself again . It should be a lifelong process . " Photograph Once your self-confidence has been bolstered , your attitude toward life will improve . Now that the real you has returned , you 're ready to explore the possibilities and fulfill the promise of your life . // <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
