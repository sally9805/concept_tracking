<p> DAYTONA BEACH , Fla.  --  If fans are plunking down $ 250-plus for a leather jacket that looks like Jeff Gordon 's firesuit and tuning into cable TV to watch drivers practice for an upcoming race , NASCAR must be doing something right . But does the sport have enough horsepower to outrun a lousy economy and zigzag through the conflicts that come with moving a garage industry into the mainstream ? <p> While TV ratings are sliding for most sports , NASCAR 's continue to increase . Ratings on NBC/TNT were up 13% in 2002 compared with 2001 . <p> Hip , talented young drivers are starting to attract fans from the MTV generation , taking over the sport just in time to replace popular veterans who are nearing the end of their careers . <p> A year ago executives held a state-of-the-sport presentation for the media , trying to make the case that NASCAR , not baseball or basketball , is the nation 's second-most-popular sport to football . The idea was n't universally accepted , but nobody fell over laughing . <p> " Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief operating officer George Pyne . <p> Good , but not perfect . The once-mighty Petty Enterprises team came to Daytona International Speedway with two cars , not its usual three , when a sponsor pulled out , and the team could n't find a replacement . Another respectable team , Andy Petree 's , does n't have a sponsor for the full season . " Walk around the garage area and see how many new sponsors came into the sport this past year , " says Kyle Petty , Richard 's son and the team 's CEO . " At a time when the sport has grown by leaps and bounds , when the ratings are as high as they 've ever been , when attendance is going through the roof , the corporate partnerships that these teams have and that we have have leveled off , if anything . When you look at that , I think that 's something that could raise its head , especially if we go to war . " <p> There are other concerns : The France family , which founded NASCAR in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disrupt its control of the sport . Attendance is lagging at a few tracks , bringing up the bigger issue of moving races from small media markets into big markets . And several of NASCAR 's old-line tracks need aesthetic improvements . <p> Stick to the rules <p> One thing that sets NASCAR apart from other sports is officials ' willingness to change rules in midseason to ensure close competition . <p> NASCAR 's efforts to even up competition resulted in 18 different drivers , including five first-time winners , visiting victory lane last season  --  one year after a record 19 drivers won . But those rules adjustments cost team owners a lot of money . Crewmembers who excel at crafting and installing car body parts are well paid , and teams try to outbid each other for those who do it with the most precision . <p> Those costs get passed along to teams ' corporate sponsors , and a more expensive sponsorship is less attractive to companies . <p> " That 's the issue : Make a rule , stick with it , " Petty says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASCAR-dictated specifications . Officials hope this cuts down on midseason rules tinkering . <p> However , officials are committed to making whatever changes and whenever they have to make them to increase the chances of exciting finishes . <p> The sport was built on last-lap showdowns but only had one last season : Jeff Gordon bumped Rusty Wallace out of the way with a few laps to go at Bristol ( Tenn . ) Motor Speedway in August . <p> Fix the schedule <p> Last month , NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr . announced that the series might take one race away from each of four old-line tracks that traditionally have had two race dates a year . Those dates , he said , could be moved into new markets for 2004 . Why stop there ? There are plenty of tracks that have two races a year and plenty of untapped markets that do n't have a race . If NASCAR wants to expand , reducing the number of races at existing tracks appears to be the only option . <p> France 's suggestion that dates could be moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the management of Speedway Motorsports Inc . ( SMI ) , the USA 's second-largest track ownership group . The largest track group , International Speedway Corp . ( ISC ) , is , like NASCAR , controlled by the France family . <p> An SMI shareholder is suing NASCAR and ISC , alleging anti-trust ; how , they contend , can NASCAR fairly award lucrative race dates to tracks when the same family that runs NASCAR also owns a bunch of tracks ? <p> Gary Roberts , director of the sports law program at Tulane Law School , says the Frances would be wise to settle . " It could cost them a lot of money , " he says . " It could force them to rethink whether they want to be in the track ownership business . " <p> The lawsuit is expected to go to trial early next year , but NASCAR could likely make it go away by giving a second race date to SMI 's track outside Dallas  --  a move that , racing politics aside , probably makes sense anyway . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race it has every year . <p> Upgrade facilities <p> It was a big deal when the NFL 's Philadelphia Eagles played their last game at Veterans Stadium , a dilapidated facility commonly derided as a " dump . " <p> " From certain camera angles , some of the racetracks we run on look like Taj Mahals , " Petty says . " But when you show up , you say , ' This ca n't be the same place . ' " <p> If NASCAR wants to attract upscale fans to racetracks , several tracks will need major aesthetic improvements . <p> Some tracks generally are n't even considered for hosting sponsors ' at-track corporate hospitality events because they do n't have the right facilities , are in bad locations or simply are n't nice places to spend time . <p> Tracks that are most in need of upgrades are Pocono ( Pa . ) Raceway , Watkins Glen ( N.Y. ) International and Darlington ( S.C. ) Raceway . <p> Says Pyne : " You 've got Camden Yards , and you 've got Fenway Park . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities we have . " <p> Relatively new tracks such as Texas , California , Chicagoland , Kansas City and Las Vegas are pleasant places to watch races  --  but so is Bristol Motor Speedway , a track that opened in 1961 but has become one of the sport 's crown jewels through constant upgrades . <p> Pyne says NASCAR faces a unique challenge when it comes to building and maintaining facilities : Unlike many other pro sports stadiums , tracks do n't get millions of dollars in funding from local and state governments . <p> Change but do n't sell your soul <p> NASCAR faces a slew of challenges and decisions as it moves toward the mainstream . For a microcosm , the debate over series sponsor Winston . <p> The cigarette brand has sponsored NASCAR 's top-level series , the Winston Cup , for 33 years ; everyone in the sport acknowledges its role in helping the sport grow and appreciates the money and effort put into promoting it . But at the same time , moving away from big tobacco might help NASCAR move into the mainstream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step aside before their current five-year contract runs out in 2007 if NASCAR finds a suitable replacement . <p> Pyne says upcoming changes involve hard decisions for NASCAR , but they are decisions that must be made : " I think that 's probably the single biggest challenge that NASCAR has . We 're really talking about managing success , and managing it in a way that is mindful of all the key ingredients that have made you successful  --  and also being mindful that the world is a changing place .
