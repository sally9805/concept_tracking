Or , more precisely , an English rose with gracefully arching canes and sumptuous , softly colored blooms that open like teacups filled with fluffy petals . These modern hybrids , developed in England by David Austin during the late 1960s , combine the flower form of old roses like Bourbons , Damasks , and Gallicas with the repeat-blooming habit of modern hybrid teas and floribundas . English roses come in shades of apricot and amber-gold as well as reds , pinks , and white . Many are richly perfumed . If there 's a downside to these beauties , it 's that they do n't always perform in the West as described in catalogs . Where growing seasons are long and warm , a variety that stays a docile 4 feet tall in England 's soft northern light and drizzle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower clusters on the cane tips . Imagine a summer hat perched high atop a bunch of willowy canes , and you get the picture . But by paying attention to the three guidelines that follow , gardeners throughout the West can succeed with English roses . In mild-winter areas , now is the best time to add a little romance to your garden . Match variety with region Ask any rose expert to name a favorite English rose , and the response is most often based on how well that particular variety grows in the expert 's region . " ' Tamora ' is really wonderful-well behaved in our climate , " says SyI Arena of Arena Roses . Clair Martin , rose curator at Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino , California , adds , ' " William Shakespeare 2000 ' is one of the best ever-very fragrant , and tolerates heat . " Kimberli Wadsworth of High Country Roses likes ' Graham Thomas ' because " it stays 4 feet tall here , and blooms all summer for us . " The 10 varieties listed at left are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy to grow . Most are well behaved , except where noted . Consider the plant 's use English roses vary from shrubs to gangly sprawlers and climbers ; choose a variety suited to the effect you want as well as to your site and climate . Informal hedge . Bushy shrubs make the best hedges . ' " Mary Rose ' is spectacular , " says John Clements of Heirloom Roses , whose plants form a 100-foot-long hedge . he spaces his plants about 2 feet apart . Beds and borders . Varieties with short , upright growth are good in beds . For mixed borders , pair English roses with perennials . Pink-flowered ' Eglantyne ' , for example , is pretty with lower-growing , blue-flowered Salvia nemorosa ' East Friesland ' . Climbers . Many English roses can be trained as 6- to 8-foot climbers , ideal for walls , small arches , or pillars . These include ' Abraham Darby ' , ' Gertrude Jekyll ' , and ' Graham Thomas ' . Focal point . For visual punch in a large area , plant three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triangle formation ; allow 2 feet between this grouping and any neighboring plants . As they grow , the roses will weave together to resemble a single more dramatic shrub . Photograph Above : ' Molineux ' spills over a weathered split-rail fence . Left : ' Abraham Darby ' . // Prune or train them Allow English roses to develop for two to three years before pruning them . Then , toward the end of winter before growth starts , prune as needed according to their growth habits . Bushy kinds need only a light annual pruning . Remove dead , crossing , or diseased canes , then cut out a few old stems at the base . Finally , cut back the remaining canes , removing just the tips . In warm climates , some shrub types produce long , flexible canes . You can grow these kinds as climbers ( encourage bloom by fanning out the canes , or by pruning a few of the main stems lower than the others ) . Or bend the canes into loops , tying the tips to lower points on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . Where winters are cold , low temperatures often cause some dieback . Wait until after buds appear in April or May , then cut off dead growth . Plant care PLANTING TIME : January and February in mild climates , April in cold ones . LOCATION : Full sun most of the day ; avoid sites with excessive root competition from nearby plants . SOIL : Rich and well drained ; work in plenty of compost and well-rotted manure before planting . WATERING : Keep soil moist during the spring and summer growing season . FERTILIZING : Apply a complete rose food at the start of the growing season , between mid-February and mid-March ( earlier in mild climates , later in cold climates ) and again in june or july . WEEDING : Pull weeds that grow around the base-especially during the first few years after planting . GROOMING : To keep blooms coming , snip off spent flowers regularly . WINTER PROTECTION : In cold climates , apply a 12-inch-deep layer of barkchip mulch around plants . // During the first few years after planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip off all foliage ( wear leather gloves ) . After stripping them , carefully bend the flexible canes out and down , forming a loop ; it helps to have someone hold the stem as you tie it so it wo n't fly loose . Tie the top growth either to a lower portion of the same cane or to another cane using raffia or green garden tape . The following spring , each cane produces dozens of blooms along its length ( instead of a few blooms up near the top ) . Photograph Above : ' Molineiix ' spills over a weathered split-rail fence .
