Take away the exploding drummers and foil-wrapped cucumbers , and This Is Spinal Tap is a movie about people who take themselves seriously . Which is why it 's a comedy classic . Christopher Guest used that same seriousness in three more improvised comedies : Waiting for Guffman , Best in Show and a new folk-music film , A Mighty Wind . Guest , who writes his movies with Eugene Levy , reunited with Tap alumni Harry Shearer and Michael McKean as the Folksmen in this film . All four sat with TIME 's Richard Corliss and Josh Tyrangiel for a folksy conversation . <P> AFTER SPINAL TAP , WHICH WAS DIRECTED BY ROB REINER , HOW DID CHRIS TAKE OVER AS THE DIRECTOR OF THIS TROUPE ? <P> CG : Have I ? When Harry and I went to Saturday Night Live for one year in ' 84 , I said , " I do n't care what happens here ; I 'll direct these little films . " I think I just knew that the comedy that can come from improvisation was so much funnier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to movies that are supposed to be comedies ; you 're lucky if there are five laughs in the entire 90 minutes . <P> HS : Maybe if you got him high he 'd like it better . <P> CG : It occurred to me . I 'm trying . <P> MM : Like he had n't thought of that . <P> A MIGHTY WIND IS AN IMPROVISED MOVIE , YET EUGENE AND CHRIS ARE CREDITED AS WRITERS . <P> CG : We wrote the story . The story is very specific and has a beginning , middle and end . All the scenes are broken down  --  there are 120 scenes , and everyone knows what happens in every scene . And there 's a backstory created for all the characters . <P> CAN THE ACTORS EMBELLISH THEIR BACKSTORIES ? <P> CG : No . It 's very important that everyone has the same information going into a scene , because we ca n't contradict one another . When jazz guys are improvising , they know what key they 're starting in , and the melody they improvise off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : you have a skeleton of something you can build on . <P> EL : The actors work with wardrobe and makeup and hair . They design the look that they 're going to have . <P> CG : I say to the actors , " What do you want on the desk in this scene ? What do you want to wear ? " In a conventional movie , the costume designer says , " There 'll be stuff hanging in your trailer . This is what you 're wearing . " I say to our wardrobe person , " You go with the actors to find the right sweater . " It has to be comfortable ... <P> HS : Mine was itchy . <P> CG : That was my idea . <P> MM : You should have said something , maybe when we were shooting . <P> HS : I 've been holding it in for so long . <P> YOU SHOT 80 HOURS OF FOOTAGE . HOW DO YOU PULL IT ALL TOGETHER ? <P> CG : I do n't see anything until I sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start talking and taking notes . But unlike a real documentary , where you do n't know the story until you shoot , we know what the story is . We have to pick scenes that tell the story . So maybe something is funny , but if it 's off story , it 's gone . <P> ARE YOU GUYS INVOLVED IN THE EDITING ? <P> HS : No , but Chris is very generous in the sense that during the editing process , we 're talking and he says , " Come by , look at some stuff . " <P> MM : We do n't say anything . <P> HS : Imitating Guest . " Do n't say anything ! But come and look . " <P> MM : " Bring food . "
