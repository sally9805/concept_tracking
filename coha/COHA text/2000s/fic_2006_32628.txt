The Disappointment Artist By Jonathan Lethem Random House Jonathan Lethem Defending The Searchers ( Scenes in the Life of an Obsession ) 1 . Bennington What 's weird in retrospect is how I seem to have willed the circumstances into being , how much I seemed to know before I knew anything at all . There should n't have been anything at stake for me , seeing The Searchers that first time . Yet there was . Going to a film society screening was ordinarily a social act , but I made sure to go alone that night . I smoked a joint alone too , my usual preparation then for a Significant Moment . And I chose my heavy black-rimmed glasses , the ones I wore when I wanted to appear nerdishly remote and intense , as though to decorate my outer self with a confession of inner reality . The evening of that first viewing of The Searchers I readied myself like a man who suspects his first date might become an elopement . I was n't a man . I was nineteen , a freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never been to private school , and the distance between my experience and the other students ' , most of whom had never set foot inside a public school like those I 'd attended in Brooklyn , would be hard to overstate . On the surface I probably came off like an exuberant chameleon . I plied my new friends with stories of inner-city danger when I wanted to play the exotic , aped their precocious cynicism when I did n't . Beneath that surface I was weathering a brutally sudden confrontation with the reality of class . My bohemian-artisan upbringingmy parents were hippieshad masked the facts of my own exclusion from real privilege , more adeptly than is possible anymore . It was 1982 . Soon the weight of these confusions crushed my sense of belonging , and I dropped out . But before that , I cloaked my abreaction in a hectic show of confidence : I was the first freshman ever to run the film society . The role freed me to move easily through the complex social layers at Bennington , impressing people with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus I was able to hire myself as a projectionist , one of the least degrading work-study jobs , then pad the hours , since I was my own manager . So when I walked into Tishman Hall , Bennington 's small , free-standing movie theater , I was entering my own little domain on a campus that really was n't mine at all . Which had everything to do with the episode that night . The rows of wooden seats in Tishman were fulldeep in the Vermont woods , any movie was diversion enough for a Tuesday nightbut I doubt any of my closest friends were there . I do n't remember . I do remember glancing up at the booth to see that this night 's projectionist was my least competent . The lights dimmed , the babble hushed , and the movie began . A cowboy ballad in harmony plays over the titles . You 're thrust into a melodrama in blazing Technicolor , which has faded to the color of worrisome salmon . A homestead on the open range-no , hardly the range . This family has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of those baked and broken monoliths rendered trite by Jeep commercials . You think : they might as well try to farm on the moon . The relationships between the characters are uneasy , murky , despite broad performances , corny lines . At the center of the screen is this guy , a sort of baked and broken monolith himself , an actor you might feel you were supposed to know . John Wayne . I 'd seen part of Rooster Cogburn on television . The only feature Western I 'd ever watched was Blazing Saddles , but I 'd passingly absorbed the conventions from F Troop , from Gunsmoke , from a Mad Magazine parody of 3:10 to Yuma . Similarly , I 'd grasped a sense of John Wayne 's iconographic gravity from the parodies and rejections that littered seventies culture . I knew him by his opposite : something of Wayne 's force is encoded in Dustin Hoffman , Elliott Gould , Alan Alda . And the voicein high school I 'd sung along with a hit song called " Rappin ' Duke " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're bad , with your rap / Well I 'll tell ya , Pilgrim , I started the crap " As for movies , I was a perverse muddle , another result of my parents ' milieu . I 'd seen dozens by Godard and Truffaut , and never one by Howard Hawks or John Ford . My parents had taken me to The Harder They Come , not The Wizard of Oz . In my scattershot reading I 'd sensed something missing in my knowledge , something central , a body of Hollywood texts the European directors revered like a Bible . But I 'd never seen an American film older than Dr. Strangelove . Somewhere in my reading I 'd also gleaned that The Searchers was terribly important , though not how , or why , or to whom . Wayne 's character , Ethan , is tormented and tormenting . His fury is righteous and uglyresentment worn as a fetish . It isolates him in every scene . It isolates him from you , watching , even as his charisma wrenches you closer , into an alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit him to your concept of hero , but though he 's riding off now , chasing a band of murderous Indians , it does n't work . No parody had prepared you for this . Was n't Wayne supposed to be a joke ? Were n't Westerns meant to be simple ? The film on the screen is lush , portentous . You 're worried for it . Now Wayne and the other riders falter . The Indians , it seems , have circled back , to raid the farmhouse the riders have left behind . The family , they 're the ones in danger . The riders race back in a panic . They 've failed . The farmhouse is a smoldering cinder , the family dead . The woman Wayne seemed to care for , raped and murdered . Her daughter , Wayne 's niece , kidnapped . The sky darkens . The score is a dirge , no ballad now . Wayne squints , sets his jaw : the girl would be better dead than in the hands of the savages . John Wayne 's a fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried in a different way . That 's when the audience in Tishman began laughing and catcalling . Some , of course , had been laughing from the start , at the conventions of 1950s Hollywood . Now , as the drama deepened and the stakes became clear , the whole audience joined them . It was the path of least resistance . The pressure of the film , its brazen ambiguity , was too much . It was easier to view it as a racist antique , a naive and turgid artifact dredged out of our parents ' bankrupt fifties culture . Benefit of the doubt : What cue , what whiff of context was there to suggest to this audience why it should risk following where this film was going ? These were jaded twenty-year-old sophisticates , whose idea of a film to ponder was something sultry and pretentiousLiquid Sky , The Draughtsman 's Contract . If an older film stood a chance it should be in black-and-white , ideally starring Humphrey Bogart , whose cynical urbanity would n't appall a young crowd nursing its fragile sense of cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand a chance . A white actor wearing dark makeup to play the main Indian character did n't stand a chance . John Wayne , above all , did n't stand a chance . The laughter drowned out the movie . I was confused by the film , further confused by the laughter . The Searchers was overripe , and begged for rejection . But the story was beginning to reach me , speak to me in its hellish voice , though I did n't understand what it was saying . And I clung to shreds of received wisdomthis was the film that meant so much to . . . who was it ? Scorsese ? Bogdanovich ? There must be something there . The laughter , I decided , was fatuous , easy . A retreat . Sitting there trying to watch through the howls , I boiled . Then the film broke . The crowd groaned knowingly . This was n't uncommon . The lights in the booth came up , illuminating the auditorium , as my projectionist frantically rethreaded the projector . It was then I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to express my anger at the audience 's refusal to give The Searchers a chance . A print brittle enough to break once in Tishman 's rusty projectors was likely to do it again , and by the time the film was up and running I 'd made a bargain with myself : if there was another break I 'd rise and defend the film . My silent vow scared the shit out of me . I sat trembling , hating the crowd , hating myself for caring , and praying the film would n't break again . The Searchers was meant to be the center of this experience , but with one thing and another it was reeling away from me . It did break again . I did stand and speak . What I recall least about that night are the words which actually came out of my mouth , but you can bet they were incoherent . I 'd love to claim I said something about how presentational strategies that look natural to us in contemporary films would look just as silly to an audience in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd love to think I said something about an American tendency to underestimate the past , that I planted a seed by suggesting The Searchers had been put together by artists with a self-consciousness , possibly even a sense of irony , of their own . Of course , I did n't . I was nineteen . I called them idiots and told them to shut up . What I did n't do , could n't do , was defend The Searchers itself . I had n't seen more than a third of the film , after all , and what I 'd seen I had n't understood . My schoolmates might be wrong to condescend to this film , but I could n't tell them why . Years later I 'd come to see that part of what I was defending , by instinct , was the fact that the film had the lousy taste to be a Western in the first place . The aspiring novelist who 'd soon make his first clumsy attempts to work out his surrealist impulses in the despised medium of science fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast his moral sagas in the despised form of the genre Western . The indignation I felt was partly on my own behalf , indignation I could n't express because I was ashamed of it . So The Searchers and I began our relationship with a grudge in common , but at that moment , under the astonished eyes of my schoolmates , I was only sure I 'd made some irrevocable commitment , laid my cards on the table . I did n't know which cards , or what table . I sat . The film started again . The audience was quieter , mainly because it had thinned . In the face of this unpromising night , this ludicrous film they 'd now been informed they were n't allowed to laugh at , and who knew how many breakages to come , half the audience opted for the campus cafe , for an early corner on a booth and pitcher of beer . Face burning , I settled in for my hard-won film , determined now to see its greatness . But the worst was to come . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech came a scene of such giddy misogyny , such willful racism , it seemed indefensible by design . During a comic mix-up at an Indian barter session , Wayne 's sidekick has inadvertently acquired an Indian wife . The sidekick and Wayne tolerate her presence , barely , until nightfall . When they bed down by the fire the chubby Indian girl slides in beside the sidekick , drawing exaggerated and unfunny derision from Wayne . The sidekick , enraged , kicks the girl out of his bedroll , so hard she cascades down a hill . There she ends in the dust , weeping , her ludicrous marriage in ruins . Wayne hoots with pleasure , his eyes maniacal . The scene is odious . The chance Wayne might be some kind of hero , that the filmmakers might redeem him , or themselves , has been pissed away . The crowd bellowed , cawed . There were more defections . Those who stayed were ruthless , their suspicions confirmed , surpassed . The Searchers had slapped me down . I had to sit it out , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the audience , of myself . My watching brain did worse than withdraw . It became autistic . After the turmoil of the first half , I followed the rest as a plot schematic , unable to risk any identification or strong response . The Searchers was only a camp opportunity after all . I was a fool . 2 . San Francisco D. was a junkie , though not at first . When we met , D. was one of the most dauntingly clever , well-read , and pop-culturally savvy people I 'd known . He 'd written for a legendary L.A. fanzine , was friends with a famous underground cartoonist and a famous punk singer . I was honored to be collected into this company . D. was also a sweet and devoted friend . Just a bit of a drinker , and with a weakness for speed , then overly fond of Ecstasy . I 'd indulged with him at timeswe went to see the first Batman movie together on mushroomsbut I could never keep up with him , never go the lengths . When D. got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends , as though working by rote through some shopworn guidebook to junkie behavior . I avoided him , not systematically , but in guilt at his decline and my complicity . The pleasures in knowing D. had slowly evaporated anyway , mercurial charm replaced by boozy maunderings , devoted attentiveness by passive-aggressive gambits . Besides , I had to protect my stuff , my pawnable books and records . Our friendship became a room we 'd both abandoned . Then D. came to share a large apartment in San Francisco with three roommates , one of whom was my girlfriend . There I 'd edge past him in the corridor and kitchen , exchange pleasantries , try not to get caught alone . His method-actorish comings and goings for " cigarettes , " his jittery , sweaty jags , all were made awfully plain there . The three roommates and I were a microscope D. was under , and we took too much satisfaction from watching our sample squirm , nodding and rolling our eyes at one another to excuse our collective failure , the fact that we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . It was a terrible place , and we were all locked into a terrible stasis . One day I rented a videotape of The Searchers and brought it to the apartment . This was seven years after the screening at Bennington . I had n't seen the film since , though I 'd prepared plenty , read about it anywhere I could , gathered evidence of its greatness . I needed to justify being stirred that first time , to prove that the force of that moment was more than a neurotic projection , that it resided in the film , intrinsic . In the process , of course , I 'd repeated my mistake : this second viewing was already overburdened . ( In fact I was about to begin a novel I 'd predetermined should be influenced by The Searchers . ) Armed with cribbed defenses of various aspects of the film , I was ready to lecture my girlfriend as we watched : See , Wayne 's the villain of the piece until the end ; see , it 's a film about racism , obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe , you knowhe actually spoke Navaho . She : Gosh ! So went the fantasies . Continues ...
