Hermina Morita has a grand vision for Hawaii 's energy future . A state representative , Morita chairs a legislative committee to reduce Hawaii 's dependence on oil , which accounts for 88 percent of its energy and is mainly imported on tankers from Asia and Alaska . In April 2001 , the committee approved a $200,000 " jumpstart " grant to support a public/private partnership in hydrogen research and development , tapping the island state 's plentiful geothermal , solar , and wind resources to split water and produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells to power buses and cars , homes and businesses , and military and fishing fleets . <p> The grant grew out of a consultant study suggesting that hydrogen could become widely cost-effective in Hawaii this decade . The University of Hawaii , meanwhile , has received $2 million from the U.S. Department of Defense for a fuel cell project . Possibilities include Hawaii becoming a mid-Pacific refueling point , shipping its own hydrogen to Oceania , other states , and Japan . Instead of importing energy , Morita told a San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capable of producing more hydrogen than we need , so we can send the excess to California . " <p> Leaders of the tiny South Pacific island of Vanuatu have similar aspirations . In September 2000 , President John Bani appealed to international donors and energy experts to help prepare a feasibility study for developing a hydrogen-based renewable energy economy . The economically depressed and climactically vulnerable island , which spends nearly as much money on petroleum-based products as it receives from all of its exports , hopes to become 100 percent renewable-energy-based by 2020 . Like Hawaii , it has abundant geothermal and solar energy , which can be used to make hydrogen . And like Hawaii , it hopes to become an exporter , providing energy to neighboring islands . " As part of the hydrogen power and renewable energy initiative we will strive to provide electricity to every village in Vanuatu , " the government announced in its October 5 , 2000 , issue of Environment News Service . <p> Hawaii and Vanuatu are following the lead of yet another island , Iceland , which amazed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's first hydrogen society . Iceland , which spent $185 million  --  a quarter of its trade deficit-on oil imports in 2000 , has joined forces with Shell Hydrogen , DaimlerChrysler , and Norsk Hydro in a multimillion-dollar initiative to convert the island 's buses , cars , and boats to hydrogen and fuel cells over the next thirty to forty years . The brainchild of a chemist named Bragi Arnason and nicknamed " Professor Hydrogen , " the project will begin in the capital of Reykjavik , with the city 's bus fleet drawing on hydrogen from a nearby fertilizer plant and later refilling from a station that produces hydrogen on site from abundant supplies of geothermal and hydroelectric energy  --  which furnish 99 percent of Iceland 's power . If the project is successful , the island hopes to become a " Kuwait of the North , " exporting hydrogen to Europe and other countries . " Iceland is already a world leader in using renewable energy , " announced Thorsteinn Sigfusson , chair of the venture , in March 2001 , adding that the bus project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first hydrogen economy . " <p> Jules Verne would be pleased  --  though not surprised  --  to see his vision of a planet powered by hydrogen unfolding in this way . After all , it was in an 1874 book entitled The Mysterious Island that Verne first sketched a world in which water  --  and the hydrogen that , along with oxygen , composed it  --  would be " the coal of the future . " A century and a quarter later , the idea of using hydrogen  --  the simplest , lightest , and most abundant element in the universe  --  as a primary form of energy is beginning to move from the pages of science fiction and into speeches of industry executives . " Greenery , innovation , and market forces are shaping the future of our industry and propelling us inexorably toward hydrogen energy , " Texaco executive Frank Ingriselli explained in April 2001 to members of the Science Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives . " Those who do n't pursue it , will rue it . " <p> Indeed , several converging forces explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advent of greater competition in the energy industry are part of the equation . But equally important motivations for exploring hydrogen are the energy-related problems of energy security , air pollution , and climate change  --  problems that are collectively calling into question the fundamental sustainability of the current energy system . These factors reveal why islands , stationed on the front lines of vulnerability to high oil prices and climate change , are in the vanguard of the hydrogen transition . <p> Yet Iceland and other nations represent just the bare beginning in terms of the changes that lie ahead in the energy world . The commercial implications of a transition to hydrogen as the world 's major energy currency will be staggering , putting the $2 trillion energy industry through its greatest tumult since the early days of Standard Oil and Rockefeller . Over 100 companies are aiming to commercialize fuel cells for a broad range of applications  --  from cell phones , laptop computers , and soda machines to homes , offices , and factories to vehicles of all kinds . Hydrogen is also being researched for direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spending between $500 million and $1 billion annually on hydrogen . Leading energy suppliers are creating hydrogen divisions , while major carmakers are pouring billions of dollars into a race to put the first fuel cell vehicles on the market between 2003 and 2005 . In California , twenty-three auto , fuel , and fuel cell companies and seven government agencies are partnering to fuel and test drive seventy cars and buses over the next few years . Hydrogen and fuel cell companies have captured the attention of venture capitalist firms and investment banks anxious to get into the hot new space known as ET , or energy technology . <p> The geopolitical implications of hydrogen are enormous as well . Coal fueled the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century rise of Great Britain and modern Germany ; in the twentieth century , oil laid the foundation for the United States ' unprecedented economic and military power . Today 's U.S. superpower status , in turn , may eventually be eclipsed by countries that harness hydrogen as aggressively as the United States tapped oil a century ago . Countries that focus their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind in the rush for tomorrow 's prize . As Don Huberts , chief executive officer of Shell Hydrogen , has noted : " The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones , and the oil age will not end because we run out of oil . " Access to geographically concentrated petroleum has also influenced world wars , the 1991 Persian Gulf War , and relations between and among Western economies , the Middle East , and the developing world . Shifting to the plentiful , more dispersed hydrogen could alter the power balances among energy-producing and energy-consuming nations , possibly turning today 's importers into tomorrow 's exporters . <p> The most important consequence of a hydrogen economy may be the replacement of the twentieth-century " hydrocarbon society " with something far better . Twentieth-century humans used ten times as much energy as their ancestors had in the thousand years preceding 1900 . This increase was enabled primarily by fossil fuels , which account for 90 percent of energy worldwide . Global energy consumption is projected to rise by close to 60 percent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are projected to increase by approximately 30 and 40 percent , respectively . <p> Most of the future growth in energy is expected to take place in transportation , where motorization continues to rise and where petroleum is the dominant fuel , accounting for 95 percent of the total . Failure to develop alternatives to oil would heighten growing reliance on oil imports , raising the risk of political and military conflict and economic disruption . In industrial nations , the share of imports in overall oil demand would rise from roughly 56 percent today to 72 percent by 2010 . Coal , meanwhile , is projected to maintain its grip on more than half the world 's power supply . Continued rises in coal and oil use would exacerbate urban air problems in industrialized cities that still exceed air pollution health standards and in megacities such as Delhi , Beijing , and Mexico City , which experience thousands of pollution-related deaths each year . And prolonging petroleum and coal reliance in transportation and electricity would increase annual global carbon emissions from 6.1 to 9.8 billion tons by 2020 , accelerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coastal flooding , and loss of small islands ; extreme weather events ; reduced agricultural productivity and water availability ; and the loss of biodiversity . <p> Hydrogen can not , on its own , entirely solve each of these complex problems , which are affected not only by fuel supply but also by such factors as population , over- and underconsumption , sprawl , congestion , and vehicle dependence . But hydrogen could provide a major hedge against these risks . By enabling the spread of appliances , more decentralized " micropower " plants , and vehicles based on efficient fuel cells , whose only byproduct is water , hydrogen would dramatically cut emissions of particulates , carbon monoxide , sulfur and nitrogen oxides , and other local air pollutants . By providing a secure and abundant domestic supply of fuel , hydrogen would significantly reduce oil import requirements , providing the energy independence and security that many nations crave . <p> Hydrogen would , in addition , facilitate the transition from limited nonrenewable stocks of fossil fuels to unlimited flows of renewable sources , playing an essential role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to avoid the most severe effects of climate change . According to the World Energy Assessment , released in 2000 by several United Nations agencies and the World Energy Council , which emphasizes " the strategic importance of hydrogen as an energy carrier , " the accelerated replacement of oil and other fossil fuels with hydrogen could help achieve " deep reductions " in carbon emissions and avoid a doubling of preindustrial carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere  --  a level at which scientists expect major , and potentially irreversible , ecological and economic disruptions . Hydrogen fuel cells could also help address global energy inequities  --  providing fuel and power and spurring employment and exports in the rural regions of the developing world , where nearly two billion people lack access to modern energy services . <p> Despite these potential benefits , and despite early movement toward a hydrogen economy , its full realization faces an array of technical and economic obstacles . Hydrogen has yet o be piped into the mainstream of the energy policies and strategies of governments and businesses , which tend to aim at preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , and its emphasis on expanding fossil fuel production , serving as the most recent example of this mindset . In the energy sector 's equivalent of U.S. political campaign finance , market structures have long been tilted toward fossil fuel production . Subsidies to these energy sources  --  in the form of direct supports and the " external " costs of pollution  --  are estimated at roughly $300 billion annually . <p> The perverse signals in today 's energy market , which lead to artificially low fossil fuel prices and encourage the production and use of those fuels , make it difficult for hydrogen and fuel cells  --  whose production , delivery , and storage costs are improving but look high under such circumstances  --  to compete with the entrenched gasoline-run internal combustion engines and coal-fired power plants . This skewed market could push the broad availability of fuel cell vehicles and power plants a decade or more into the future . Unless the antiquated rules of the energy economy  --  aimed at keeping hydrocarbon production cheap by shifting the cost to consumers and the environment  --  are reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the most significant obstacles to realizing the full promise of hydrogen is the prevailing perception that a full-fledged hydrogen infrastructure  --  the system for producing , storing , and delivering the gas  --  would immediately cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build , far more than a system based on liquid fuels such as gasoline or methanol . As a result , auto and energy companies are investing millions of dollars in the development of reformer and vehicle technologies that would derive and use hydrogen from these liquids , keeping the current petroleum-based infrastructure intact . <p> This incremental path  --  continuing to rely on the dirtier , less secure fossil fuels as a bridge to the new energy system-represents a costly wrong turn , both financially and environmentally . Should manufacturers " lock in " to mass-producing inferior fuel cell vehicles just as a hydrogen infrastructure approaches viability , trillions of dollars worth of assets could be wasted . Furthermore , by perpetuating petroleum consumption and import dependence and the excess emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases , this route would deprive society of numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from fossil fuels . Over the long run , this proportion needs to be shifted toward renewable sources , not maintained , for hydrogen production to be sustainable . <p> In the past several years , a number of scientists have openly challenged the conventional wisdom of the incremental path . Their research suggests that the direct use of hydrogen is , in fact , the quickest and least costly route  --  for the consumer and the environment  --  toward a hydrogen infrastructure . Their studies point to an alternative pathway that would initially use the existing infrastructure for natural gas  --  the cleanest fossil fuel and the fastest growing in terms of use  --  and employ fuel cells in niche applications to bring down their costs to competitive levels , spurring added hydrogen infrastructure investment . As the costs of producing hydrogen from renewable energy fell , meanwhile , hydrogen would evolve into the major source of storage for the limitless but intermittent flows of the sun , wind , tides , and Earth 's heat . The end result would be a clean , natural hydrogen cycle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen , with the latter used in fuel cells to produce electricity and water  --  which then would be available to repeat the process . <p> There are no major technical obstacles to the alternative path to hydrogen . As one researcher has put it , " If we really decided that we wanted a clean hydrogen economy , we could have it by 2010 . " But the political and institutional barriers are formidable . Both government and industry have devoted far more resources to the gasoline- and methanol-based route than to the direct hydrogen path . Hydrogen receives a fraction of the research funding that is allocated to coal , oil , nuclear , and other mature , commercial energy sources . Within energy companies , the hydrocarbon side of the business argues that oil will be dominant for decades to come , even as other divisions prepare for its successors . And very little has been done to educate people about the properties and safety of hydrogen , even though public acceptance  --  or lack thereof  --  will in the end make or break the hydrogen future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more secure path to hydrogen point to an essential  --  and little recognized  --  role for government . Indeed , without aggressive energy and environmental policies , the hydrogen economy is likely to emerge along the more incremental path , and at a pace that is inadequate for dealing with the range of challenges posed by the incumbent energy system . Neither market forces nor government flat will , in isolation , move us down the more direct , more difficult route . The challenge is for government to guide the transition , setting the rules of the game and working with industry and society toward the preferable hydrogen future . <p> This catalytic leadership role would be analogous to that played by government in launching another infrastructure in the early years of the Cold War . Recognizing the strategic importance of having its networks of information more decentralized and less vulnerable to attack , the U.S. government engaged in critical research , incentives , and public/private collaboration toward development of what we now call the Internet . An equally , and arguably even more , compelling case can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that best limits vulnerability to air pollution , energy insecurity , and climate change . Investments made today will heavily influence in what manner and how fast the hydrogen economy emerges in coming decades . As with creating the Internet , putting humans on the moon , and other great endeavors , it is the cost of inaction that should most occupy the minds of our leaders now , at the dawn of the hydrogen age . <p> By Seth Dunn <p> <p> Seth Dunn is a research associate at the Worldwatch Institute , where he is a member of the climate/energy team and for which he has written extensively .
