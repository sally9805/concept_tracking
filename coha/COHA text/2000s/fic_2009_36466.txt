Crunchy Nut <p> I was surrounded by laughter but , for once , could n't even pretend to join in . I wanted to place one of my daughters on my lap and hug her tightly , but I had taught myself not to do that . At eight , even my youngest considered herself too old for such public displays of affection . On our own at home was fine , but that was n't when I needed her protection . I felt a hand land on my shoulder , and I automatically formed a smile as I turned . <p> " Thank you so much for everything you 've done , " said the woman looking down at me . <p> " I 'm happy to help , " I replied . <p> " Everyone tells me you 've been amazing . " <p> My eight-year-old beamed . If her headmistress said I was amazing , I must be doing something right . <p> " I am so looking forward to this , " the imposing woman said as she took her seat . The nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , had not noticed the giant presence of her principal , because she was too busy craning her neck to search the back of the room . Ever since we 'd sat down , she 'd been keeping a vigilant eye on the entrance . I eased her shoulders round to face the stage . " He 'll be here , " I said , glancing at the empty seat . " Do n't worry . " <p> " I 'm not worried , " she said , immediately turning back . <p> The lights dimmed and an awed murmur rose up from the assorted parents , siblings , and extras , and dissolved into a hush . Four worried chestnut-colored eyes sought mine in the gloom of the darkened assembly hall . <p> " He 'll be here , " I said again , taking their hands , and , as the first note drifted up from the piano , he was . <p> " Daddy ! " squeaked the girls , bouncing off their chairs . <p> Jimmy eased his way along the narrow aisle with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He even stopped to kiss a particularly good friend of ours , and shook some of the other dads ' hands . " Sit down , " I mouthed at him . <p> He leaned over and kissed me , then both of the girls . " Sorry , " he said . " Meeting went on . " <p> I put my fingers to my lips and pointed toward the stage . The thick green velvet curtains were being drawn back to expose the mean streets of Hell 's Kitchen , New York , where girls dressed as boys clicked and hissed and spat at one another , marking out the infamous territories between the Jets and the Sharks . <p> Then the aggression left the stage and there was our eldest daughter . She peered out at us through an invisible mirror , examining her reflection as intensely as everyone else was now examining her . Was it my imagination or did a collective gasp ripple through the audience ? She looked phenomenally beautiful . Older and more self-possessed than her fourteen years  --  how was it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amber , moving around the stage as easily as liquid , my brain leaping ahead to her next line before she 'd finished delivering the one she was on . I was impressed , mesmerized , and terrified in equal measures . As for Amber , I could tell by the hem of her dress that she was as steady as a rock . <p> She looked beautiful . Did I say that already ? Her dark red hair was pulled off her face with a white ribbon , her long , slender body still startling inside the neat , sensible dress of a good Catholic . She had skin the color of milk , but when she opened her mouth to sing , the London girls ' school faded away and we fell into the world of a Puerto Rican on the eve of her first dance . <p> Jimmy reached over our nine-year-old and gazed into my eyes . He squeezed my hand hard , but then our middle daughter took ownership of her father and placed his hand firmly in her lap . I looked down at mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers returned to their perpetual cold . <p> At the interval , Jimmy and I were thickly showered with compliments by our parental alumni  --  some genuine , some tinged with green , and some downright barbed . Why is it that I always remember the barbed ones ? <p> " You must be so proud . When Talullah won her scholarship I made sure she stayed grounded by insisting she make her bed every day . It worked a treat , you should do it with Amber so it does n't all go to her head . " <p> " She already makes her bed , " I replied , confused . <p> " Oh , " said the woman , equally confused . <p> We stood awkwardly until another " compliment " cut through the air like a missile . <p> " Wonderful , is n't she ? You 'll have a job on your hands keeping Amber 's feet on the ground now , " said a starched woman , whom I had tried hard to avoid . " It was quite a big decision to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , absolutely the right choice , but I think there were some rather put-out mothers in the year above . " <p> I opened my mouth to respond , but Jimmy got there first . " Thanks for the tips , ladies . We 'll watch our backs . " They tittered . Jimmy grabbed my elbow . " Let 's go to the bar , " he said . <p> " You 'd better check for poison . " <p> " Why me ? " he asked . <p> " Do you want to sew on the name tags ? " <p> " Ca n't you get iron-on ones , these days ? " <p> " Yes . But answer me one question . What is an iron ? " <p> The lines on Jimmy 's face deepened in mock concentration . " You win . I drink first . " <p> There were more " helpful " comments as we pushed our way through the crowd , but fortunately , since I have amassed a staggering eighteen daughter-years at this school , I know who and where my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say , because women dominate my life . <p> I left Jimmy happily surrounded by some , walked to the sheeted trestle table , and picked up a handful of crisps . " Hey , Carmen , " I said to one of my favorite fellow maternal inmates . <p> <br> Continues ...
