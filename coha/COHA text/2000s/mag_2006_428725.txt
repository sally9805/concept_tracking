A rustic , inviting meal based on Italian ingenuity // Thrifty Italian cooks have long been known for their inventive ways with leftovers , and stale bread in particular has inspired a number of famous dishes . One of the most delicious examples is ribollita , which starts out as homemade minestrone made with , say , stock , onions , garlic , carrots , kale , celery , herbs and white beans . A day or so later , the leftover soup is reheated ( ribollita means " reboiled " ) and chunks of day-old crusty Italian bread - sometimes rubbed with garlic or dotted with olive oil or both - are put in the bottom of each bowl or stirred into the pot . The bread acts as a thickener and provides a hearty texture . This rustic bread soup is a meal in a bowl , so all you need to add is a salad and light dessert for a cozy , comforting dinner . menu RIBOLLITA FRISE AND ENDIVE SALAD WITH OLIVE VINAIGRETTE COCONUT ICE CREAM WITH RASPBERRY SAUCE Photograph Coconut Ice Cream with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // FRISE AND ENDIVE SALAD WITH OLIVE VINAIGRETTE Serves 6 * Vegan * 30 minutes or fewer Kalamata olives plus red wine vinegar , garlic and fresh parsley add up to a bold dressing that complements the assertive greens .
