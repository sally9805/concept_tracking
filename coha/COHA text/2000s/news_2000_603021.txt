<p> CAREFREE , Ariz.  --  Chrysler and minivans go together like Bill Gates and wealth : It 's impossible to think of one without the other . <p> Minivans saved Chrysler 's life when it was repaying loans that saved it from near-bankruptcy . Thus , the U.S. operating unit of German automaker DaimlerChrysler approaches each new generation of minivans with fear and excitement . <p> Having basically gotten it right from the first 1984 vans , yet losing share to latecomers who 've decoded what makes a proper minivan , Chrysler is tempted to try new interpretations to distinguish itself . But each time , Chrysler listens to its collective common sense and customers and settles on evolution instead of revolution . <p> So the 2001 Chrysler and Dodge minivans that will go on sale late summer or early fall wo n't look radically different from those on sale now . Nor will their specification sheets read much differently . <p> But the ' 01 minivans are quite different-feeling , rich with ideas and innovation and once again show a clarity of mission and intensity of purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes would fail to convey the major improvements , permitted December test drives of four prototype vehicles here . The outsides were clad in vinyl to conceal their true shapes and details from competitors . The interiors were mismatched , unfinished pieces typical of models built for testing . Chrysler unveiled the finished products this week at the Detroit auto show . <p> In a fit of either confidence or hubris , Chrysler provided for comparison during the test drive production-line versions of Ford Windstar , Honda Odyssey , Pontiac Montana , Toyota Previa and Mazda MPV . <p> An engineer 's rolling laboratory vs. the stamped , welded , painted , upholstered , finished products of frontline factories . Bold at the least . <p> A well-reasoned risk , though , because the ' 01 Chryslers were more appealing than the others in ways that make sense . <p> That conclusion requires leaps of faith : that the production Chryslers will behave like the prototypes ; that the fit of parts , sheen of paint and general assembly quality will be terrific ; that the rivals on hand were representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 01 Chryslers is : Wow . Here 's why : <p> * Styling.Though not a drastic change , it solidifies and emboldens what already is the best-looking minivan . Fenders bulge decisively , giving the vans a robust , even macho , look . A sharp crease runs nearly the length of the side , emphasizing a newly rakish stance . Sharp , deep creases in the hood suggest the air scoop on high-performance vehicles . <p> Taillights have been shaped to distinction . Headlights and grilles likewise are bigger and bolder . <p> * Power . No longer a weak point , it is boosted across the line . The base four-cylinder remains at 150 horsepower , but its torque gets tweaked to 170 foot-pounds , from 167 . The 3.3-liter V-6 goes to 180 hp , 210 ft. - lbs. , from 158 and 205 . The 3.8-liter V-6 is squeezed to 215 hp , 245 ft. - lbs. , from 180 , 240 . <p> And the 3.5-liter , overhead-camshaft V-6 from the Chrysler 300M sedan is modified for minivan use , finally putting a modern-design V-6 under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda and Toyota vans . The 3.5 is rated 230 hp , 250 ft. - lbs . It revved quickly and pleasantly , creating a minivan that was fun to floor . For ' 01 models , the 3.5 is available only in the top-level Town and Country Limited . But wider availability is expected eventually . <p> * Seats.Normal seat-cushion suspension replaces foam blocks that Chrysler came up with as a cheap way to do seats in previous minivans . <p> In a move sure to cause controversy and criticism , Chrysler decided not to ape Honda 's " stow-and-go " third-row seat . Honda 's swivels into the floor so you do n't need to remove it to gain extra floor space for cargo . <p> But that design would have cost Chrysler the ability to continue offering all-wheel-drive , because the seat well would block the rear-drive components . <p> Instead , Chrysler split its third-row seat into two separate chairs on most models . And it put wheels on them . They must be removed for floor space , but at least they are lighter now , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out if a mix of way-back seating and extra space is desired . <p> * Power pedals.Optional adjustment lets you move the pedals close or far so you can get safely distant from the steering-wheel air bag . <p> * Kid seats.You can get built-ins , even in the bucket seats or with the leather upholstery . Other makers are ignoring or eliminating the option . Chrysler 's enhancing it . <p> * Conversation . You could have one without shouting or turning your head . Front-to-third-row chats were fairly easy . Not a van for secrets . <p> * Power sliding side doors . General Motors , Honda and Ford already have these , but Chrysler 's have a clutch that unhooks the power drive if you try to open or close the door manually . That makes the Chrysler sliders work just like normal , unpowered doors , while the others put up a fight if you try to operate them by hand . <p> * Power tailgate.Hit the button , and it motors open or closed after delaying 2 seconds and beeping a warning . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something between the gate and the body as it closes , such as a finger or a tree branch , it reverses . You can override it by hand during its motion . <p> * Movable console.It unlatches from between the front bucket seats to snap into place between the optional middle-row bucket seats . Or get a second one from the dealer and have front and rear consoles with 12-volt power outlets . <p> But features galore and nifty styling would n't be enough to erase bad road manners . Fortunately , the ' 01 Chryslers ' were pretty good . The three different V-6 models tested ranged from adequate for the 3.3 to yowza for the 3.5 . The 3.8 was a nice balance of performance and economy . It will be priced less than the 3.5 and uses regular fuel . The automatic transmissions shifted quickly , yet were n't jerky or abrupt even when the throttle was jammed on , let off and floored again in a test that usually brings out the worst . <p> Steering seemed nicely weighted , staying straight without fussing , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vans were quiet , too . The Honda transmitted ugly amounts of road noise into the passenger compartment on rough asphalt , by contrast . And the Ford groaned and bellowed vs. the Chrysler 's distant growl . <p> But the Chryslers lose points to rivals in some areas . <p> Seating caused many of the troubles . Third-row passengers had undue difficulty unlatching the middle-row bucket seat to exit the van , for instance . ( Chrysler says it will lengthen the latch an inch or so on production models . ) Middle buckets did n't adjust fore and aft . The front seat interfered with the safety belt when the seat was slid back , as for a tall driver . ( Chrysler says it will move the belt to fix that . ) <p> The power-latching mechanism that 's part of the power-sliding side doors was noisy . <p> Scabby-looking sealing tape covered some seams in the door jambs and on the doors . <p> The knock on Chrysler 's minivans has been that , while the most thoughtful and best looking , their quality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caravan from Consumer Reports ' April auto issue is typical : " If only it were reliable , this long-wheelbase version of the plain Caravan would be a good choice among minivans . It and its sibling Chrysler vans have consistently scored the highest in our tests  --  but , alas , they 've been consistently less reliable . " <p> Chrysler chiefs insist there 's no problem and note recent good scores in J.D. Power and Associates vehicle-quality surveys . There 's no way to predict from a daylong test drive what might break at 1,000 miles or 20,000 miles . That 's especially so in an engineering prototype . <p> If your faith-leaping sneakers are n't worn out yet , so that you 're willing to assume the ' 01 Chrysler vans are at least equal to rivals ' in quality , then it 's hard not to reach this conclusion : Chrysler 's minivans  --  assuming the ' 01s live up to pre-production promises  --  set a new standard for the category . <p> 2001 CHRYSLER MINIVANS <p> What are they ? Conventional minivans , able to seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What 's standard ? Chrysler still is deciding . <p> What 's the lineup ? There 's no more Plymouth Voyager , because Chrysler is discontinuing the Plymouth brand . Voyager becomes the lowest-priced Chrysler-brand van and the only short-wheelbase Chrysler model . Other Chrysler-brand models will be LX , LXi and Limited , all available with front- or all-wheel drive . <p> Dodge brand will offer Caravan SE and Caravan Sport as short-wheelbase models . Long-wheelbase models will be Grand Caravan Sport and Grand Caravan ES . All the long-wheelbase Dodges will be available with front- or all-wheel drive . <p> How much ? Chrysler has n't decided yet , but there 's enough competition among minivans to keep prices close to today 's . <p> How soon ? On sale late summer or early fall . <p> Overall ? The new minivan standard  --  if the engineering prototypes are true and Chrysler has improved its quality as much as promised .
