<p> A bit over a week ago , President Bush and his men promised to provide the legal , constitutional and moral justifications for the sort of warrantless spying on Americans that has been illegal for nearly 30 years . Instead , we got the familiar mix of political spin , clumsy historical misinformation , contemptuous dismissals of civil liberties concerns , cynical attempts to paint dissents as anti-American and pro-terrorist , and a couple of big , dangerous lies . <p> The first was that the domestic spying program is carefully aimed only at people who are actively working with Al Qaeda , when actually it has violated the rights of countless innocent Americans . And the second was that the Bush team could have prevented the 9/11 attacks if only they had thought of eavesdropping without a warrant . <p> Sept. 11 could have been prevented . This is breathtakingly cynical . The nation 's guardians did not miss the 9/11 plot because it takes a few hours to get a warrant to eavesdrop on phone calls and e-mail messages . They missed the plot because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say 9/11 could have been prevented said at the time that no one could possibly have foreseen the attacks . We keep hoping that Mr. Bush will finally lay down the bloody banner of 9/11 , but Karl Rove , who emerged from hiding recently to talk about domestic spying , made it clear that will not happen  --  because the White House thinks it can make Democrats look as though they do not want to defend America . " President Bush believes if Al Qaeda is calling somebody in America , it is in our national security interest to know who they 're calling and why , " he told Republican officials . " Some important Democrats clearly disagree . " <p> Mr. Rove knows perfectly well that no Democrat has ever said any such thing  --  and that nothing prevented American intelligence from listening to a call from Al Qaeda to the United States , or a call from the United States to Al Qaeda , before Sept. 11 , 2001 , or since . The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act simply required the government to obey the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the job much easier . <p> Only bad guys are spied on . Bush officials have said the surveillance is tightly focused only on contacts between people in this country and Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups . Vice President Dick Cheney claimed it saved thousands of lives by preventing attacks . But reporting in this paper has shown that the National Security Agency swept up vast quantities of e-mail messages and telephone calls and used computer searches to generate thousands of leads . F.B.I . officials said virtually all of these led to dead ends or to innocent Americans . The biggest fish the administration has claimed so far has been a crackpot who wanted to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge with a blowtorch  --  a case that F.B.I . officials said was not connected to the spying operation anyway . <p> The spying is legal . The secret program violates the law as currently written . It 's that simple . In fact , FISA was enacted in 1978 to avoid just this sort of abuse . It said that the government could not spy on Americans by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to their telephone conversations without obtaining a warrant from a special court created for this purpose . The court has approved tens of thousands of warrants over the years and rejected a handful . <p> As amended after 9/11 , the law says the government needs probable cause , the constitutional gold standard , to believe the subject of the surveillance works for a foreign power or a terrorist group , or is a lone-wolf terrorist . The attorney general can authorize electronic snooping on his own for 72 hours and seek a warrant later . But that was not good enough for Mr. Bush , who lowered the standard for spying on Americans from " probable cause " to " reasonable belief " and then cast aside the bedrock democratic principle of judicial review . <p> Just trust us . Mr. Bush made himself the judge of the proper balance between national security and Americans ' rights , between the law and presidential power . He wants Americans to accept , on faith , that he is doing it right . But even if the United States had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than law , Mr. Bush would not have earned that kind of trust . The domestic spying program is part of a well-established pattern : when Mr. Bush does n't like the rules , he just changes them , as he has done for the detention and treatment of prisoners and has threatened to do in other areas , like the confirmation of his judicial nominees . He has consistently shown a lack of regard for privacy , civil liberties and judicial due process in claiming his sweeping powers . The founders of our country created the system of checks and balances to avert just this sort of imperial arrogance . <p> The rules needed to be changed . In 2002 , a Republican senator  --  Mike DeWine of Ohio  --  introduced a bill that would have done just that , by lowering the standard for issuing a warrant from probable cause to " reasonable suspicion " for a " non-United States person . " But the Justice Department opposed it , saying the change raised " both significant legal and practical issues " and may have been unconstitutional . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans that reasonable suspicion is a perfectly fine standard for spying on Americans as well as non-Americans  --  and they are the sole judges of what is reasonable . <p> So why oppose the DeWine bill ? Perhaps because Mr. Bush had already secretly lowered the standard of proof  --  and dispensed with judges and warrants  --  for Americans and non-Americans alike , and did not want anyone to know . <p> War changes everything . Mr. Bush says Congress gave him the authority to do anything he wanted when it authorized the invasion of Afghanistan . There is simply nothing in the record to support this ridiculous argument . <p> The administration also says that the vote was the start of a war against terrorism and that the spying operation is what Mr. Cheney calls a " wartime measure . " That just does n't hold up . The Constitution does suggest expanded presidential powers in a time of war . But the men who wrote it had in mind wars with a beginning and an end . The war Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney keep trying to sell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents did it . Mr. Gonzales , who had the incredible bad taste to begin his defense of the spying operation by talking of those who plunged to their deaths from the flaming twin towers , claimed historic precedent for a president to authorize warrantless surveillance . He mentioned George Washington , Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt . These precedents have no bearing on the current situation , and Mr. Gonzales 's timeline conveniently ended with F.D.R. , rather than including Richard Nixon , whose surveillance of antiwar groups and other political opponents inspired FISA in the first place . Like Mr. Nixon , Mr. Bush is waging an unpopular war , and his administration has abused its powers against antiwar groups and even those that are just anti-Republican . <p> The Senate Judiciary Committee is about to start hearings on the domestic spying . Congress has failed , tragically , on several occasions in the last five years to rein in Mr. Bush and restore the checks and balances that are the genius of American constitutional democracy . It is critical that it not betray the public once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
