She had always liked the landlord , Mr. Beaman . Until today . Buddy watched his mouth as he talked , and she hated him . " If your dad do n't show up , " he said , " you know , in a reasonable period of time , I can call Washington Social Services for you . They know what to do about kids who do n't have anywhere to go . " Buddy did n't have to look at her brother to see that he shared her feelings about that . Being put in a foster home , or a shelter ? There was n't even a shelter , as far as she knew , except in the big cities like Tacoma or Seattle , away . And she was sure Dad would n't want them to resort to anything like that . Mr. Beaman must have read their rejection in their faces . He switched tactics . " You kids got relatives . Idaho , ai n't it ? Or Montana , someplace like that . Go to them . That 's the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frozen in shock . The same shock Buddy was feeling , only her brother did n't speak . " We ca n't go to Montana , " Buddy exclaimed . " They do n't even write to us , did n't write much even before Mama died . " Mr. Beaman licked his lips and looked miserable . " Still , they 're family . You 're just kids . They 'll look after you . See , the thing is ... you 're two months behind on the rent now . And ... well , you know I lost my job , too , when the mill closed . Same as your dad . I need the rent money . And ... I got a family wants to rent the house . They got cash , first month and a deposit . I ... told ' em they could move in Friday , first of the month . " Bart looked as if he were frozen . His lips barely moved . " I do n't think ... it 's not legal to just throw us out with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you have n't paid me any rent for almost three months . That 's notice enough to be legal , I reckon . I need the money myself . I have to take this while I got the chance . " " But you told my dad  --  " " He said he 'd get money to me before this . I ca n't wait any longer , " Mr. Beaman said with determination , even though he was looking somewhat guilty . " You 're gon na have to move , anyway , right , if the only job he could find is out of town ? So you 're gon na have to get out of the house before I lose these renters . " Buddy could n't believe what she was hearing . " But we ca n't go to Haysville , " she told him , glancing at her brother in the hope he 'd back her up . " We have to wait until Dad comes back ! " The man licked his lips again . " I 'm sorry , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She felt as if she were drowning , suffocating . Bart made a strangling sound , and finally spoke in a voice that was n't like his at all . " We could n't take all our stuff with us . Not in a car . " " No , no , I realize that . You can store it in the garage . I told the new people you would n't be able to clear that out yet . You do n't own any of the furniture , so just pack the rest of it . Get some boxes at the Stop and Shop . They always have boxes . " And then he was gone , letting the door slam behind him , down the front steps to his car . Buddy glared after him through the sting of tears . " What 're we going to do ? " she demanded . Bart rubbed a hand across his mouth . " Get out , I guess . " " But Dad wo n't know where to find us when he comes back ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them if he could n't find us here . But we do n't have to go yet . We ... we could manage in the car for a day or two , could n't we ? Park near the bus station . It 's open all night . We could use the bathroom there , just for a couple of days . Watch for Dad , if he comes in on the bus . " " Sleep in the car ? Like we 're homeless ? " Her voice squeaked . Bart looked her straight in the face . " Buddy , we are homeless . Until Dad comes back . " She cried then . How could anybody live in a car ? No bathroom , no kitchen , no room to stretch out to sleep ? How would they cook ? How would they stay clean ? How could they go to school ? Bart was watching her with hurting eyes . " It would n't be for long , " he said . " At least Dad left the car . We wo n't be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't care what he said , it ca n't be legal to just put us out on the street ! " " I do n't think it is , but how would we pay a law-yer ? If we could afford one , we 'd have paid the rent . And he 's right about our having to move pretty soon , anyway . Dad said we probably would n't be able to stay here if he had to work out of Lewiston . " Buddy was terrified . But there did n't seem to be any choices to speak of . The next day they did n't go to school . Instead , Bart brought home a car-load of boxes , and they started packing everything they 'd have to move out of the rented house . She kept on drizzling all through the job . Tears ran down her cheeks , and she wiped them on the sleeve of her sweatshirt . Her nose ran , too . The tissues had already been packed somewhere , so she used toilet paper to wipe her nose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleenex in and kept it out . She figured they 'd better have it in the car . A car does n't hold much . Pillows , they decided , and a couple of blankets apiece . Food that would n't spoil without refrigeration and did n't need to be cooked . Buddy looked drearily at her brother , who was putting books into a carton and sealing it . " What about clothes ? " she asked . " Keep it simple . Jeans and shirts , a jacket in case it 's cold . Stuff that does n't have to be hung up . Things you can wear more than once without washing . Socks and underwear . If we have to , we can wash those out in the rest room at the bus station . " " What about this ? " she asked as she picked up Mama 's photo album . " In with the books ? It has the only pictures of her except for that big one Dad has on his nightstand . Maybe we ought to keep it with us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cold , keeping in the hurt . " We do n't have room for it , Buddy . We ca n't take anything in the car we do n't absolutely have to have . " She could n't bring herself to put it in with the books . She sank down on the floor , Indian fashion , and opened the big album flat on her legs . " Look . There 's Mom when she was my age . With Aunt Cassie and Aunt Addie . " Bart did n't answer . He closed that box and pulled over another one . Buddy leafed through the snapshots . Mama and Dad before they were married . Aunt Adelaide when she graduated from high school , with her hair in stiff curls , thin and wearing a smile . And her wedding picture , when she married Uncle Ed , who died . They all went to his funeral when Buddy was about six . Mama did n't cry , but she hugged Aunt Addie . She flipped through the pages , stirring up memories . Some of the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least did n't remember . But she could pick out Aunt Cassie . She was shorter than Addie , and rounder , with a pretty , laughing face . There was one of her with Mama , their arms around each other , making silly faces at the camera . And a formal picture , taken by a professional photographer , of Grandpa Dolan . He had died before Buddy was even born , so she did n't remember him . But she remembered Grandpa Harry . The picture of him showed an old man , tall and thin and elegant in a white suit , leaning slightly on a cane . He was really their great-grandpa , and he 'd been very old when she 'd seen him last . He had owned the Ostrom Appliance and Hardware Store in Haysville , and he always had butterscotch drops wrapped in cellophane in his pockets for visiting kids . Buddy turned a page and saw snapshots of Bart and then herself as babies and later as toddlers . She 'd been fat then , and so had Bart . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Buddy , we 've got to get this done , " Bart said , and jammed it into the box of books he was working on . They packed dishes and bedding and towels . They packed Dad 's clothes , and labeled all the cartons so they could find things in a hurry when Dad wanted them . He 'd only taken a small bag with him . He 'd grinned at them and said , " I 'll be home in a week , two weeks at the most , with a paycheck . Maybe I can talk them into giving me an advance , so I can get some money to you sooner than that . You kids 'll be okay for that long . We 'll go out and celebrate . Steaks , maybe . " " Or pizza . " Buddy had offered a counter suggestion , and he 'd laughed and hugged her . " Whatever you want , little Buddy . You mind what Bart says , now . No squabbling , okay ? " And he 'd gotten into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they 'd both gotten jobs . They felt good about it , because he 'd only be gone a short time , and it was a relief that someone had hired him after the mill shut down and practically everybody in town got laid off . There would n't be any more work here at home , and they 'd probably have to move , but that was okay , as long as they were together . It was lucky Dad had had truck driving experience , even though he had n't liked being away from home so much , which was why he 'd quit to go into the mill . That way he could be home every night even if it was hard , monotonous work . Only that had been well over a week ago , almost two weeks , and there had been no word from Dad . No money order , no postcard , no phone call . Nothing . Buddy closed the lid on another box and tried to stop sniveling . She did n't want to make it any harder on Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the garage , and Buddy prayed Dad would return soon and find them another place to live . They left the house after they 'd fixed a last meal  --  canned tamales and peaches  --  on Thursday night . It was a good thing Bart had his driver 's license , so nobody could stop them from taking the car through town . They had trouble finding a parking spot near the bus station at first , so they pulled in a couple of blocks down . There was a theater across the street , and Buddy suggested maybe they should go to the movie until the traffic cleared out and they could get closer to the bus station . " I do n't think we 'd better , " Bart said soberly . " Dad gave me enough money to last until he came home , but he 's late . We do n't know how long what I have left will have to last . I ca n't get at his bank account , and I do n't think there 's much in it , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We 'd better just sit and read until it gets dark . " Buddy tried , but she could n't concentrate . She opened a box of crackers , and they shared them . After a while traffic thinned out , and they drove by the station again . This time Bart found a spot just half a block down . They arranged their pillows and blankets as comfortably as they could and tried to settle down and sleep . It was n't late , but it had been an exhausting day , especially emotionally . For Bart 's sake , Buddy tried not to cry out loud . She did n't successfully muffle her sobs , though , because he reached over the back of the seat and squeezed her shoulder comfortingly . " It 'll be okay , " he assured her . " This wo n't last for long . " When you cry , your nose gets plugged up and you ca n't breathe well enough to sleep lying down . Buddy thought longingly of her bed  --  her rented bed , she remembered , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable . Would it have been different if they 'd had their own furniture , the things they 'd had before Mama died ? When they moved that last time , after she was gone , their father had n't seemed to want to keep anything that reminded him she was n't there . So they had sold what they had and rented the furnished house . Had that been a mistake ? A police car went by , siren screaming , as she was trying to say her prayers . The neon lights of a bar across the street blinked off and on , making reflections on the metallic door handle . A stray cat meowed piteously , setting off a fresh gush of tears . I understand how you feel , kitty , she told it silently . Nowhere to go , not knowing where your next meal is coming from . About that time Buddy realized that she had to stop feeling sorry for herself . She could almost hear Mama 's voice . " Having a little pity-party , are we , Buddy ? " Defensively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? But that made her feel guilty . She did know where her next meal was coming from . They still had some groceries left , in a box in the trunk . They could eat tuna , and pork and beans , and peaches right out of the cans . For a few days yet . Dad would surely be back by then . And Bart was n't whining and feeling sorry for himself . In the backseat her brother shifted position , trying to arrange his tall frame on the too-short seat . " Bart ? " Buddy murmured . " What are we going to do if Dad does n't come back really soon ? " " I do n't know , " Bart said . " Do n't worry about it , Buddy . I 'll think of something . " She finally fell asleep , wondering if her back and neck would be broken before morning . It must have been several hours later when she woke in a panic . Someone was trying to open the door on the sidewalk side of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the face pressed against the window . A man with a big nose stared in at her , his bad skin tinted by the light from the neon sign across the street . She struggled to a sitting position , drawing as far away from him as she could get . Behind her , Bart reared up also and rapped sharply on his own window . " Get out of here ! Leave us alone ! " he commanded , and the face retreated . " It 's just a drunk , " he said . " The doors are locked . He ca n't get in . " Buddy watched the man wander away , unable to walk steadily . He had frightened Buddy badly , and she resented his peering in at them . But a part of her recognized that he , too , was without a home . " We ca n't keep parking here , " she said , her voice shaking . " No , " Bart agreed , leaning back into his pillow . He twisted around and held his watch up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's only an hour or so until daylight . Go back to sleep , Buddy . We 're safe enough as long as we do n't unlock the doors . " She did n't feel safe . She would n't feel safe again until Dad came back , and they were living in a house again . As soon as it was light , they went into the bus station . They did n't need to get dressed , because they 'd slept in their clothes , but they had to use the rest rooms . Nobody paid any attention or seemed to care if they washed their faces there and brushed their teeth . Back in the car , Buddy was too depressed to ask her brother any questions . He waited until they 'd eaten a crackers and peanut butter breakfast , washed down with canned juice , before he told her what he 'd decided . " While we were in the station I asked about the price of a ticket to Haysville . " When she opened her mouth to protest , he put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy . I thought about it all night long , and we do n't have any choice . I ca n't keep you out of school , and I ca n't let you live in a car , not even for another night . I called Aunt Cassie . She said of course they 'd take you in , so I 'm putting you on a bus today . There 's one that leaves early this morning . " She shoved his hand aside in indignation . " And what about you , then ? Are n't you coming , too ? " " I ca n't , " Bart said , and his tone sobered her . " It 's been too long , Buddy . Dad thought he 'd be back by now . He 'd have come home if he could have . And if he could have called , he would have . Something 's happened to him , and I have to go find out what . " She swallowed , her fighting spirit wilting . " What could have happened ? " she whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , do you ? " Or dead ? she was wondering . Bart inhaled deeply and then let the breath all out . " Maybe . It had to be something serious , or he 'd have kept his promise to get in touch . I have to go , Buddy . Do n't make it any harder by refusing to cooperate . You have to go to Aunt Cassie 's . " The recollection of that drunken man peering into the car while he tried the door handle sent a shudder through her , and she knew Bart was right . But she made one last feeble try to avoid being sent to an aunt who had , it had always seemed , not liked their mother . " Why ca n't I come with you , then , wherever you have to go ? " " Because you 're eleven years old , not seventeen , and we 'd still have to be living in the car until I either find Dad or get a job to earn enough to support us . I do n't want us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make it any harder than it has to be . " Her shoulders sagged , and she held back the prickle of tears . " Okay , " she said softly . " What time 's the bus ? "
