After being injured by a letter bomb that blew off both hands and blinded him in one eye , Michael Lapsley , S.S.M.-an Anglican priest of the Society of the Sacred Mission and a longtime opponent of apartheid in South Africa-founded the Institute for the Healing of Memories in Cape Town . During a visit to New York City , he spoke of his anti-apartheid efforts and his present work as director of the institute . The interviewer was George M. Anderson , S.J. , an associate editor ofAmerica . The projects Web site is at : **27;357;TOOLONG . Photograph // HOW DID YOU , A NEW ZEALANDERS happen to go to South Africa ? After my ordination in Australia in 1973 , my religious order sent me to South Africa to study and to serve as a chaplain on three university campuses . Before going , I had never really reflected on the fact that the apartheid system would be so all-embracing , and that my color as a white person would define me as belonging to either the oppressed or the oppressor group-whether I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arrival , I went to live in a white area , because by law that was the only area where I could live . I remember going into a government building to sort out my passport situation , and seeing two elevators . One was marked for whites only , and the other was for " goods and nonwhites " - as if we whites were people , and blacks were objects . Wherever you turned , everything was defined by race . I remember saying to a young black medical student that I was against apartheid . In reply he said , " That 's very nice , Father , and where are you going to sleep tonight ? " He was reminding me of the objective character of apartheid , even though subjectively I might be rejecting it . There was no escape from apartheid . How did you become actively involved in the struggle against apartheid ? The violence in Soweto in 1976-when hundreds of black people were killed , including children-was a turning point . What shook my faith to its foundations was the realization that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible and went to church on Sundays . Previously , I had been a committed pacifist , but the events of Soweto brought me to the painful conclusion that armed struggle was morally legitimate and even necessary . Although I expressed only pacifist views while living there , I was expelled from the country in September of the same year as the events in Soweto . How did your expulsion take place ? The government withdrew my student visa and gave me 14 days to leave the country . Initially I went to live in Lesotho , an independent African country completely surrounded by South Africa but free of the apartheid system . There I completed my studies in English and psychology , and became chaplain of the National University of Lesotho . By then , I had become a member of the African National Congress , which had begun its armed struggle in South Africa . Because of my activism , after seven years I left Lesotho following another massacre in which church authorities believed I was a target . So I went to Zimbabwe , where , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A.N.C. , mobilizing the faith community to see that the situation in South Africa concerning its apartheid policies involved issues of faith . It was there in Zimbabwe that I received the letter bomb in 1990 . What happened ? I was at home when the bomb arrived , a package with two religious magazines inside . When I opened one of them , the bomb exploded , causing me to lose both hands and the sight in one eye . Already in 1987 , three years earlier , the Zimbabwe government had warned me that I was on the South African government 's hit list . I had been living in Zimbabwe with round-the-clock armed police guards . It was a very sophisticated bomb to be able to travel through the post undetected , and there is no doubt that it originated through the machinery of the South African state . After the explosion , I spent a month in a hospital in Harare , then another six months in two hospitals in Australia before returning to New Zealand . By then , negotiations had begun between the A.N.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for me to go back to South Africa . People from around the world had helped me through my own long healing process , so I felt that I had a role in the healing of the country , and therefore in 1992 I returned . How did the bombing and your injuries affect your faith ? The actual bombing took me back to the earliest faith of my childhood , to a dependence on God . It caused me to feel a deepening of God 's presence within me . By that time in my life , my experience of apartheid had led to a certain disintegration of faith , especially because of the degree to which apartheid laws were carried out in the name of the Gospel . The bombing also took me on a journey from being a freedom fighter to being a healer , and this role has become the particular emphasis of my ministry today . After my return , I was struck by the many ways people had been damaged by apartheid , and it seemed to me that we all had a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were seized with the question of how to create a different kind of society on the one hand , and-on the other hand-how to deal with the past , especially the psychological , emotional and spiritual effects upon us of that journey through apartheid that we had traveled . Is this what led to the Healing of Memories project ? Yes . Initially the project had its origins in my work with a trauma center for victims of violence and torture where I was a chaplain for five years . I was one of the first two employees there , appointed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu . He had invited me back to Cape Town to work in his diocese . But then after those five years , the project got under way on its own , as a separate organization , though we still work very closely with the trauma center as a kind of complementary body . What does the healing process actually entail ? We have created what we call experiential workshops , in which people collectively explore how the past of the country has impacted upon them-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the heart . We try to find ways to help them lay to rest that which in the past would destroy them-hatred , the desire for revenge , destructive feelings in general ; and to take from the past what is life-giving : hope , faith , courage , joy . In other words , how to redeem the past with its evil and take back what is good . The essence of our methodology is storytelling in the context of journey-storytelling that encourages letting go , the acknowledgment of what is destructive because of what has happened to us . To use a health-related image , you take the bandages off the wounds . By looking at them , you 're also cleaning them before fresh bandages are put back on . That happens through the process of storytelling . In the workshops we get people not only to speak of their journey , but also to draw it as another way to be in touch with their feelings . Drawing also helps you to see your journey whole-not only to be aware of the actual distance you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the unfinished business actually is . People often feel they have been healed , but when they reflect on their journey , they may still find poison there . Toward the end of the workshop , we have a creative liturgy , during which people bring forward symbols of their journey that they themselves have created , in the form of various kinds of peace symbols . How long are the workshops ? They go from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon . We say to the people who come that we promise them one step on the road to healing and wholeness . We emphasize that it 's not magic , it 's not a fix . But it may be a watershed , a turning point through which they can begin to move forward in their journeys . For some , it may be a small step , for others a giant one . In the process , they are not simply telling their story , they are telling it to others who are able to listen respectfully and reverently . Being heard and believed in this way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workshops frequently say , " I am telling you this for the first time , " because they have carried deep pain for many years , waiting for the opportunity to share it in a safe space . Some people come back for a second workshop , feeling that although they have dealt with some of their feelings in the first , they would like to deal with another layer at a second . We have also been developing what we call a second stage model , in which people could return to the same workshop or a different one , to focus on particular aspects of anger , hatred and forgiveness-three of the big issues that people have brought to the workshops . Who come to the workshops ? Our workshops are open to all South Africans who want to explore how the past has affected them : people of all races and backgrounds , and all sides of the struggle . Some have suffered grievously in terms of torture , incarceration and exile . For others , the impact has been more indirect-dealing with things they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different races come together gives to the workshops a humanizing effect , one that includes a particularly strong dimension of reconciliation . It has been a struggle , though , to get white people to come to them-the white community is the community that has been most in denial about the past . But we are beginning to see more white Afrikaans-speaking people beginning to take part in the workshops , and that has been encouraging . One sign of hope concerns increasing initiatives toward us from the Dutch Reformed Church . Do people who have been perpetrators of violence come to the workshops ? One of the things we have discovered in this undertaking is that all human beings are capable of being both perpetrators and victims ; that is , we can be a victim at one point in our lives and a perpetrator at another . Part of the work , therefore , entails seeking to break that cycle in which victims go on to be victimizers . Those who have been the recipients of political violence , for example , can become perpetrators of violence toward members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our workshops who 've come to see themselves as perpetrators , but they are also victims-victims of having been brought up in a racist society , that has shaped them by its racist values and attitudes . Do you offer the workshops only in South Africa ? We now receive invitations to offer them in other countries too . We have given workshops in Northern Ireland , Rwanda , Sri Lanka , East Timor and Australia . Our first one outside South Africa was right here in New York City in 1998 , at the Riverside Church . How has the government 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected the development of the Healing of Memories Institute ? We saw ourselves from the start as a parallel process to the commission , and this gave a particular impetus to our work . But whereas the commission was hearing the stories of gross human rights violations , we believed it was important to create other additional spaces for people to deal with the past . We actually began our work before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission started , and we continue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of those who have come to us over the past few years were , in fact , persons who gave evidence to the commission on just one occasion and who wanted more space to deal with their feelings . The commission represented the magnanimity of the nation , showing that it did not seek vengeance . Those who admitted their part in the human rights violations and told all were granted amnesty . But so far the issue of reparation to victims has remained incomplete . Now there has been such a long delay since the commission presented its final report in 1998 that the perpetrators have so far gained more from it than the victims . It had the power to grant amnesty , but as for reparation , it could only make recommendations to the state . As a result , many victims and their relatives feel that the commission failed them . In reality , however , it is the state that has failed them to date , although in March of this year the state did announce a budgetary allocation of 800 million rands toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission had recommended . With apartheid gone , what is the situation regarding racism in South Africa today ? The fact that we now have a democratic society and a new constitution means that we have taken a giant step forward . But having got rid of apartheid , we begin the battle against racism . However , we are still at day one . It must be remembered , too , that apartheid was not only a vehicle for political oppression , but also for economic exploitation through structures that put immense wealth in the hands of a few-a situation that is still largely intact today . So to a certain extent , you see race becoming a class issue . We could become more and more nonracial , but wealth would still be possessed by a relatively small number , with the majority of the population excluded . The problem for South Africa is aggravated by massive unemployment . Economic transformation represents a much tougher challenge than the political one . " at are your expectations for South Africa in the aftermath of apartheid ? I have deep hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the next 100 years will be bumpy and even a roller coaster ride at times . But many of the most deeply hurt people have shown extraordinary generosity of spirit in their willingness to forgive and be reconciled . Today there are people in every town and village who are living heroic lives as they struggle to transform theii own lives and the lives of their communities . <p>                     @x Negative 44 percent . That 's what one of my investment statements pegged nay return for last year . <p> I tried to cope with the bad news by trotting out phrases I 'd shared with clients as a financial representative for 16 years : Stocks will go up and down , but over time outperform all other investments . Even if a return was down for years , the market ultimately rebounded , as dependable as a happy ending in a romance novel . <p> But my years of levelheaded investment planning failed me when the chips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped some more . <p> As the negative economic news continued to roll in , I was in near panic . How could my husband and I retire ? What about sending our kids to college ? Forget about going on vacation . <p> Seeing our assets deteriorate in the worst economic downturn in decades is both alarming and discouraging . <p> However , we must not forget that our real treasure is time spent with loved ones and enjoying the priceless gift of good health , which allows us to enjoy life . <p> No matter what our financial futures hold , we can follow practical tips that I learned while growing up on my parents ' small farm in the Midwest to survive and thrive . <p> L : 1 You reap what you sow . It 's discouraging when an investment loses money , but you ca n't let it derail your investment strategy by sitting out the market . Consistent investing over time is the best way to accumulate a nest egg and allows the advantage of dollar cost averaging . That means when you invest regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you should make more over time . Continue your investment plans unless something in your personal situation changes that warrants a different strategy . For example , if you lose your job or are within 10 years of retiring , you may need to adjust your plans . <p> L : 2 The early bird gets the worm . Much of the success of an investment strategy is the added value of compounding interest and reinvested dividends . Waiting to see what happens next with the economy is not a good idea . There is never a better time to invest than right now , so go full steam ahead and consider investing more . Your individual efforts at saving are more important than outside events . <p> L : 3 A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . Although investing can be exciting in some ways , be careful about investments that make claims that are " too good to be true . " Many investors have lost money by being tempted by claims of investments that " beat the market . " Weigh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something as steady as U.S. Savings Bonds can be a good option . <p> L : 4 Do n't count your chickens before they hatch . Many stocks made significant returns in the years prior to the market 's decline . Investors thought of those increases as permanent money in their pockets . However , the return on an investment can and will go up and down , until the money is withdrawn . Keep in mind that shopping on sale or buying low works in the stock market as well as at grocery and department stores . When your investment return is down , the stock market offerings are essentially " on sale . " Conversely , when you 've seen a nice increase , maybe it 's time to move some into less volatile investments . <p> L : 5 Save for a rainy day . Always have some money in liquid accounts , such as savings and money market accounts . Aim to have six to nine months of household expenses set aside . The silver lining to the economic downturn may be that , if your credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help you accumulate more savings . Also in tough economic times some consumer goods are sold at deep discounts and the interest charged on loans may be lower . <p> L : 6 Get your ducks in a row . To make good decisions , keep your financial information together and know where you stand . You wo n't be able to take advantage of lowered interest rates if you do n't know your current mortgage rate , how much you owe , or do n't keep important papers handy to prove your income and liabilities . <p> L : 7 Do n't put all your eggs in one basket . Diversify your investments by owning a mix of stocks and bonds based on your individual needs and your philosophy about investment risks . Get expert advice if you need help . Also , do n't invest all your retirement money so that it is tied in with your job . Think of Enron employees who lost jobs and retirement simultaneously . Take advantage of your employer 's discounted stocks , if available , but convert them into other investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple carefully chosen places outside of your pension . <p> L : 8 You ca n't make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . Although an investment prospectus can be challenging to read , learn to find the details about the expenses of an investment . If you ca n't find it in print , ask . Numerous studies have found that some investments with the highest initial and ongoing fees are not outperforming the market . Even good investment returns can not offset excessive fees . Always compare fees among similar investments before deciding where to invest . Consider index mutual funds , which often have lower fees because the stocks are not individually chosen but are preselected based on specified criteria . <p> L : 9 Do n't let the foxes guard the henhouse . It has been widely reported that the institutions created as watchdogs for the financial industry broke this rule . And some " experts " have stolen their clients ' money . Investors must carefully research their current as well as their potential investments and advisors . If you seek expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . By educating yourself and moving cautiously , you may stay clear of fraud . Seek out the best advice available and double-check everything by going to national consumer Web sites , such as helpforinvestors.org or investoreducation.org , and calling your state regulator . Find out what a legitimate investment statement looks like so that you will recognize fake documents . <p> L : 10 Separate the wheat from the chaff . When bombarded with economic news and investment information , work through a mental checklist . Ask yourself if the news is something that affects you personally or could in the future . Decide if there is action you should take now . If appropriate , do more research or consult an expert on the topic , such as a financial advisor , banker , or accountant . <p> Whether the market is up or down , you can have a solid investment plan if you remember to think like a farmer . No matter if the previous season brought good times or bad , drought or flood , farmers return to their fields as each spring arrives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope for the future . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Cathy Shouse <p>
