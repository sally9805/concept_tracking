DOUG GALE , A 30-YEAR-OLD Dallas banker , returned from a vacation to Tokyo and Hong Kong in 2001 raving as much about TV sets as about ancient temples , towering skyscrapers and exotic food . A self-proclaimed tech geek , Gale scouted out electronics shops and was mesmerized by flat-screen TVs . Their monstrous sizes , sleek designs and flashy displays were perfect , he thought , for watching his favorite Dallas Stars charge down the ice . " I 'd never seen anything like them , " he says of the TVs . " They were just phenomenal . As soon as I got back to Dallas I was thinking , ' I got to get me one of these ! ' " <P> Three years later , Gale 's living room is still dominated by an old picture-tube clunker . He routinely stops in Best Buy and Circuit City stores to compare prices , but the model he craves , a 45-in. cutting-edge liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) TV , has a $7,000 price tag  --  twice what Gale is willing to spend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Sound familiar ? While it seems as though hordes of couch potatoes are snapping up the latest displays , the wonders of LCD and plasma TV technology are still well out of reach for the average shopper . True , at retailer Circuit City , sales of flat-TV models have tripled over the past year , prompting CEO W. Alan McCollough to label this Christmas " a flat-panel holiday . " But as long as the price tag on a flat-screen TV is four or more times as much as a comparable tube TV , many consumers will drool and dream but not bite . " Prices of flat TVs will be cheaper for consumers this holiday season , but not cheap enough to have them explode off the shelves , " says Chris Connery , vice president of market research at DisplaySearch , a consulting firm based in Austin , Texas . <P> It 's a virtual lock that the magic price point  --  at which flat-panel TVs switch from being a status symbol of the rich and hip to an everyday feature in American living rooms  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Asian consumer-electronics companies that dominate the flat-panel industry are building too many factories too fast . A glut is in the offing , and while prices have already been falling , more rapid declines are expected . Consulting firm iSuppli Corp . estimates that a 37-in . LCD TV that now retails for more than $4,000 will cost half as much in 2006 and is likely to be less than $1,000 by 2008 . Plasma TVs will also see prices decline . A 42-in. plasma set that costs on average $2,700 today will probably fall to under $1,000 by 2007 . <P> Lofty prices have kept the market for flat-screen TVs small so far . Plasma technology dominates in supersize TVs over 40 in. , but plasma will hold only 2% of the U.S. TV market this year . More consumers buy LCD TVs , which are available in a wider range of sizes , but they still only account for less than 10% of the market . Dropping prices will change that , especially with LCD TVs , which manufacturers are gearing up to churn out the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an LCD , according to iSuppli . The U.S. is catching up to some other rich countries . In Japan , where consumers are among the most technologically savvy and are much more space conscious , about 1 in 4 TVs sold is an LCD . " In the long run , LCD TVS will be a major part of the business , " says Paul Semenza , an iSuppli vice president .
