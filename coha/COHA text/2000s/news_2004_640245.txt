<p> In 1997 , the Rose Community Foundation hired a new company to manage a portion of its investments . <p> Rose did n't have to go far . <p> The Denver-based nonprofit already had one of the nation 's top mutual-fund talents , Tom Marsico , on its investment committee . <p> Rose began shifting money to newly formed Marsico Capital Management that year . Since then , the investments have grown to $ 68 million , with Marsico 's firm collecting at least $ 1.4 million in total fees from the foundation . <p> Over time , Rose withdrew all of its investments from Janus Capital Group , Marsico 's former employer . <p> Rose officials say Marsico has managed the money well , providing better returns than most of the foundation 's other investments . They also point out that Marsico did not participate in the initial decision to put money in his funds . <p> Such arrangements are legal . But they raise conflict-of-interest questions about close ties between foundations and the community members who sit on their governing boards and committees . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members or committee members to provide professional services to their organizations . Some prohibit it but condone other controversial activities , such as allowing board members and the foundation to invest in the same ventures . <p> National critics of foundation governance said such practices highlight lax federal and state oversight of the nonprofits . <p> " Is it illegal ? Probably not . Does it challenge the standards of accountability and probity ? Yes . It looks like self-dealing , " said Rick Cohen , executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy in Washington . " It undermines the credibility of the sector . " <p> The Denver Post examined tax records of the state 's 10 largest foundations , as measured by assets , and found that at least three hold investments in companies with ties to board members or committee members . <p> Among the findings : <p>  --  Larry Mizel , chairman of Denver-based MDC Holdings and a former trustee of one of Marsico 's funds , also serves on Rose 's investment committee . One of MDC 's biggest shareholders is the Greenlight Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million investment . <p> Rose officials say Mizel disclosed all potential conflicts to the foundation and recuses himself from voting when potential conflicts arise . <p>  --  The Daniels Fund , Denver 's largest foundation , has invested at least $ 13 million in two business ventures in which a trustee of the fund , John Saeman , has a stake . Fund officials said they adhered to their disclosure and recusal policies , and that no laws were broken . <p>  --  The Boettcher Foundation has about $ 5 million in Janus funds . Janus board member Jim Craig sits on its board and its investment committee . Boettcher president Tim Schultz said the foundation made the investment before Craig joined the board in November 2000 . <p> The Council on Foundations in Washington , a national association , estimates that about a third of the country 's 62,000 foundations receive professional services from board members or their companies . <p> " Conflicts of interest are impossible to avoid , " said Andrew Schulz , a lawyer for the council . " What makes it ethical and legitimate is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately , it can be absolutely fine . " <p> Federal regulations allow foundation board members or companies they represent to provide professional services to the organization if their fees are " not excessive . " But nonprofit watchdogs say the law is too weak . <p> Foundations control enormous wealth  --  $ 6 billion in Colorado and nearly $ 500 billion nationwide . Critics contend the government does too little to ensure that board and committee members do n't steer some of that money their own way . <p> Attorneys general in several states , including New York and Minneapolis , are investigating several foundation leaders accused of skimming fund money or inappropriately accepting large loans . <p> Issues involving foundation board members and investments , meanwhile , have received less attention , according to industry observers . <p> Mutual-fund star Marsico is one of Denver 's mutual-fund stars . He spent 11 years at Janus , where he was known as an aggressive fund manager who helped lure other top talent to the company . <p> Marsico left Janus in 1997 and formed Marsico Capital in Denver . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 billion in 2000 , but he remains its chief executive . <p> He and his wife , Cydney , have given more than $ 40 million to nonprofit organizations , including the University of Colorado , the University of Denver and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . <p> Marsico has been a volunteer member of Rose 's investment committee since the foundation was established in 1995 , though he is not a trustee . <p> Rose was formed through the sale of Rose Medical Center to Columbia/HCA HealthcareCorp . It makes grants to nonprofits in the areas of child and family development , education , aging , health and Jewish life . <p> In 2002 , Rose awarded $ 21 million in grants , making it one of the most generous foundations in Colorado . Ranked by its assets of $ 230 million in 2003 , Rose was the state 's fifth-largest foundation . <p> The six-member investment committee , which includes several trustees , makes investment decisions for the foundation . <p> Rose officials and Marsico said that when the committee voted to put Marsico Capital in charge of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting . He has recused himself from voting when decisions regarding Marsico Capital have come up , they said . <p> Marsico 's funds have outperformed their large-cap peers since 2000 , according to Morningstar Inc. , though only one of the three beat the larger S &P; 500 . <p> " Whenever the foundation has selected Marsico Capital Management to manage a portion of its assets , it has been on the basis of our firm 's performance , " he said . <p> Additionally , Marsico said , he charges the foundation less than other clients of comparable size . In 2003 , Marsico charged Rose a management fee of $ 415,000 , or roughly 0.6 percent of the amount invested . The firm charges individual investors in its retail mutual funds a 0.85 percent management fee . <p> Larger investors typically pay less than retail customers , said Jeff Keil , a vice president and mutual-fund specialist with Lipper Inc. in Denver . He said Marsico 's fee is reasonable for the size of the Rose investment . <p> Marsico , who views his involvement at Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role at the foundation was being questioned by The Denver Post . <p> " The end game here should be , what are your returns ? I believe my association with Rose has been beneficial to the foundation and the causes it supports , " he said . <p> Asked about Marsico 's dual role with Rose , Schulz of the Council on Foundations said the foundation " appears to be doing a good job of policing itself and doing the right thing . " Schulz has spoken with Rose officials about the issue . <p> Rose chief executive Sheila Bugdanowitz , who has led the foundation since 1999 , said that heightened attention to ethical issues requires foundations to examine these relationships in a new light . <p> " Most people who serve on boards of nonprofits are doing it because of their feelings toward philanthropy . It 's hard for them to imagine that there 's any perception of self-interest involved , " she said . " But we are beginning to understand that not everybody shares that viewpoint , and that 's what needs to be explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community for guidance and that barring them from doing business together would damage the organizations . <p> Other foundations , however , say they draw the line at anything that might appear to be a conflict of interest . <p> " Members of our investment committee or board are n't in any way related to our investment managers , " said John Moran , chief executive of the Colorado Trust . <p> " I may be able to resolve the conflict in my mind , but the test for me is what I have to explain to the world , " Moran said . " The more you have to talk about it , the more you need to take a second look at it . It 's all about perception . " <p> Denver Foundation president David Miller agreed . <p> " We do have people on our board and investment committee who are investment managers , " he said . " We absolutely would not give them money to invest on behalf of the foundation . That would be a conflict of interest . " <p> The Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy into private ventures that the foundations invest in . <p> Such " side-by-side " investments are less common at foundations than at corporations , but they 're not unheard of . They 're difficult to track because individual investments in private ventures are n't required to be publicly disclosed . <p> " If ( investment committee members ) have an interest in the investment , when ( the ) committee is discussing it , they raise it , " said Ann Garcia , Rose 's chief financial officer . " If they are going to invest , they will tell us . Then it 's not appropriate for them to vote on it . " <p> Bugdanowitz said the Rose foundation would not necessarily know , however , if a board or committee member later chose to invest in an asset in which the foundation had already taken a stake . <p> Also on Rose 's investment committee is Mizel , who until February was a trustee for one of Marsico Capital 's funds . The foundation 's money was not invested in that fund . <p> Through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested about $ 32 million in limited partnerships and hedge funds . Investment committee members or Rose trustees may hold stakes in those assets or have other connections to them . <p> One of those investments , Greenlight Capital Offshore Fund , is run by a company that owns 9 percent of Mizel 's MDC Holdings . Rose has held a stake , worth $ 5 million in 2002 , in the hedge fund for a number of years , Garcia said . <p> She said Mizel notified the board when he learned that Greenlight was taking a position in MDC , a publicly traded firm of which Mizel is the chairman and largest shareholder , in 2002 . <p> Separately , the Daniels Fund , with assets of nearly $ 1 billion , has come under criticism for its aggressive investment moves . <p> In 2002 , Daniels bought a $ 10 million debt position in a real estate partnership in which trustee John Saeman held a 34 percent stake . <p> Later that year , Daniels put $ 2.9 million in a telecommunications partnership in which Saeman simultaneously invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in the venture , called Aloha Partners . <p> In recent interviews , Saeman and Daniels chief executive Hank Brown each said that the investments came at a time the foundation was interested in diversifying away from the plunging stock market . <p> The investments were financially rewarding opportunities that the foundation did not wish to pass up , and Saeman did not benefit from the fund 's involvement , Brown said . In the real estate deal , Saeman was forced to reduce his stake from 45 percent to allow Daniels to get involved . <p> Under federal law , board members may hold up to a 34 percent stake in any asset in which the foundation also is a shareholder . <p> " If you do n't know the facts , sure , it looks funny , " Brown said . " But everyone signed off on it , and it was a benefit to the fund and not a benefit to John . I think that makes a difference .  --  That 's the essence of the issue . " <p> Brown and other Daniels executives point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in every business deal . Daniels , who died four years ago , said conflicts could be handled ethically with full disclosure and agreement of all parties involved . <p> Ironically , there 's a difference in policy between the Rose and Daniels foundations regarding the ethics of the investments in which each is involved . <p> Officials at Rose say they frown on board members taking a big stake in a foundation investment , as Daniels allowed with Saeman . Daniels officials say they would never let a committee member invest on behalf of the foundation , as Rose allowed with Marsico . <p> To see more of The Denver Post , or to subscribe to the newspaper , go to http : //www.denverpost.com @p#
