<p> The June 9 tanker truck crash that left a three-lane-wide hole in an I-285 overpass was not the first major wreck for the company that owned the truck . <p> But U.S. Fleet Services has yet to be investigated by federal regulators charged with ensuring trucking safety  --  even though in both the Atlanta wreck and in a multi-fatality crash in Texas , its truckers had faulty driving records that included license suspensions . <p> The handling of the accidents underscores a number of problems with the regulation of the trucking industry : There is no federal requirement that drivers be professionally trained to handle big rigs . There are n't enough inspectors to give close scrutiny to the more than 500,000 active U.S. trucking firms  --  so the companies are left to police themselves . The industry resists stricter rules and backs up its position with a powerful lobbying force . <p> Federal regulations require trucking companies to check their drivers ' motor vehicle records at least once a year , but there 's no system in place to make sure that occurs . <p> Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days if they have been issued a traffic citation or their license has been suspended . But again , no one is making sure that happens  --  and no agency notifies a trucking company when one of its drivers commits a traffic violation or has a commercial driver 's license suspended or revoked . <p> And the federal government in turn relies on the industry to police itself because there are not enough inspectors to make sure the companies follow the rules . <p> " That would be an impossible task , " said David Longo , spokesman for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration , which regulates the trucking industry . <p> Most companies follow the rules , but there are unscrupulous operators , Longo said . <p> " There are the bottom feeders who need drivers and they do n't care who they hire , " he said . <p> Some industry experts say the biggest problem in the industry is that many trucking companies have lax standards for hiring and training drivers . <p> U.S. Fleet Services driver Mark Zweifel had no training , and his license had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanker through a median wall on a Houston highway in March 1999 . The tanker , loaded with 2,500 gallons of gasoline , crushed two cars , killing three people , two of them teenage girls on their way to Galveston for spring break . <p> At the time of the accident , Zweifel was in violation of numerous U.S. Department of Transportation regulations , including taking a company vehicle home for personal use . <p> In last month 's wreck in north Fulton County , a U.S. Fleet Services tanker crashed into a concrete barrier on I-285 at Ga . 400 and burst into flames , spilling more than 1,000 gallons of gasoline onto the roadway . <p> No one was injured , but the heat and flames destroyed three lanes of the busy overpass at the key interchange , rendering them impassable for almost a month . <p> Driver Jacob Phiri , 33 , was charged with speeding and driving with a suspended license . Investigators say Phiri was traveling nearly 90 mph in the 55 mph zone when the accident occurred . His driver 's license had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to appear in court on traffic charges . He had been charged with excessive speeding twice since early December . <p> " You think since they 're driving those big old trucks they 're well-trained , " said John Tavormina , an attorney in Houston who sued Horsham , Pa. - based Fleet on behalf of one of the victims in the Houston crash . " They 're not . A guy with a suspended license should n't be driving a fuel truck on an interstate highway at 2 a.m . " <p> Fleet officials declined to comment for this article . Federal officials said that despite the tanker accidents and other incidents , the company overall has a safe record . <p> Still , there are no federal requirements that drivers be professionally trained or have any experience before they take big rigs on the road . With the exception of training for drivers who transport hazardous materials , there is no requirement that companies provide training or safety education to their employees . <p> And as the industry grows , and the demand for drivers increases , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , said Don Asa , a longtime truck driver and trucking school operator who is now a trucking industry consultant in Phoenix . <p> " The level of knowledge in the driver 's seat is poor , " Asa said . <p> Firm never tested driver <p> U.S. Fleet Services is a conglomeration of diesel fuel companies in 20 states that serve as mobile gas stations for local companies . The fuel trucks operate mostly at night , going to area businesses and refilling their delivery trucks . Metro Atlanta clients include Home Depot and Coca-Cola , according to the company 's Web site . <p> Between 1997 and 1999 , Fleet bought several fuel supply companies and kept their workers . According to court records in Houston , Zweifel was an employee of Roy Moffitt Customized Fueling when Fleet bought out the business . <p> Zweifel was given no formal truck driving education and was not required to pass a driving test when Fleet took over , according to a deposition taken from Fleet 's chief operating officer , Glen Sokolis . Also , Sokolis said the company did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been driving for Moffitt , he must be qualified . <p> The company , which at the time had nearly 300 drivers in 20 states , had no safety officer and no safety program , Sokolis testified . <p> In his deposition , Zweifel said he did not know the safe stopping distance for the truck he drove and did not know that it was against DOT regulations to take a loaded gasoline tanker home at the end of his shift . <p> The depositions and those of other Fleet employees were taken on behalf of the Houston victims , whose families sued the trucking company after the accident . Fleet settled the suit out of court last year for an undisclosed amount of money . <p> Federal regulators never investigated or cited Fleet after the Houston accident , said Longo , the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration spokesman . While it is policy to inspect a company that has been involved in a serious accident , Longo said changes in the agency during 1999 may have caused the Houston crash to slip through the cracks . <p> Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Highway Administration in 1999 and created the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration , an independent agency . The goal was to focus more attention on the trucking industry and attempt to reduce the number of highway fatalities involving trucks  --  now about 5,000 a year nationwide . Lawmakers gave the agency more teeth , enabling it to penalize companies or even to yank their operating permits if they did not improve their safety records . <p> But the agency does not have enough resources to monitor every carrier , Longo said . Instead , it focuses on carriers that have the worst safety records , based on accidents and violations recorded during routine stops . <p> More trucks , fewer deaths <p> U.S. Fleet Services is not one of those , Longo said . <p> According to the agency , Fleet , established in 1997 , has been involved in three other serious accidents since 1999 in addition to those in Atlanta and Houston . <p> The agency 's database does not indicate whether those crashes resulted in any deaths . The agency was unable to provide further information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency acknowledges that there are problems in its system . Its officials are rewriting the rules for new carriers that would require all new trucking companies to be audited by the agency within 18 months of beginning operations . In addition , the agency has set a goal to reduce traffic fatalities involving trucks by 50 percent by the year 2010 , both through measures aimed at truckers and other drivers . <p> But tightening laws governing truckers is a tough proposition . <p> The American Trucking Association has routinely opposed legislation that would restrict hours logged by drivers . Its opposition carries some weight . <p> Political action committees representing trucking and containerized freight contributed $1.1 million to candidates in the 2000 election cycle . <p> Still , Congress has toughened some laws for commercial drivers . For example , under federal law , a commercial driver can be charged with DUI for a 0.04 reading , half the level required for such a charge under Georgia law for noncommercial motorists . <p> The industry also has taken steps to ensure safety , said Guy Young , vice president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trucking industry . <p> Many companies have guidelines for hiring drivers , such as hiring only those with clean driving records and experience behind the wheel . In some cases , a company 's insurance provider will have to sign off on a driver before he is hired , Young said . <p> Over the last 12 years , Young said , truck traffic has increased by 40 percent , while traffic fatalities involving trucks have decreased by 38 percent . <p> " It 's very safe . I know it does n't appear that way sometime , " he said . " In any industry , there 's going to be some bad apples . By and large , motor carrier safety is a lot better than it used to be .
