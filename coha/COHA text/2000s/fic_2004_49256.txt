LINDSEY PUT A HAND OVER each of Jack 's ears like she was holding a pumpkin and moved in nose to nose to communicate the following information wordlessly . <p> You 're wondering what we 're doing here , well , this morning , oh , a little after 9:00 , call it 9:15 , Connie at the office gave me the tickets and told me how to get here . She said go down the block and around the corner then take a right and go straight for a while . <p> " But ... but ... " <p> Then turn left and keep your eyes peeled for a doorway with stairs just inside and when you spot it , oh look there it is now , go up the stairs and down the hall to your left , no , no , your other left , to the very end , and knock , and wait for the little slot to slam open , and then you say the password . <p> " We do n't know the password ! " Jack said . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking . Connie told me the password . <p> " I ca n't believe you forgot the password . " <p> I 've almost got it . Something about holding your breath and turning blue until you find true love . <p> " Oh , never mind , " a man behind the door said . " Just fork over your tickets . " <p> Lindsey poked the tickets through the little slot in the door . <p> " Do n't hit him in the eyes ! " Jack whispered . <p> The man behind the door laughed like yeah that was going to happen . He opened the door and waited invisible in the darkness for them to enter . <p> Lindsey took Jack 's hand . Come on . It 'll be fun ! <p> Meaning the famous flutist Aloysius Mann would be in town for only a few days , and Jack said , " So that should have meant there would be less time we 'd have to spend avoiding him , " and she said , very funny ! <p> Besides , we 're already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jack did n't believe that bit about Connie at the office getting the tickets . There might not even be a Connie at the office . It was like every date lately , Lindsey had been so evasive , nervous sidelong glances , unaccountable giggling , and comments right out of the blue like oh , do n't you just love the woodwinds , and oh , would n't it be great if we could take in more cultural events , and oh , look , the world famous Aloysius Mann is coming to this funky little uptown club , and oh , I wonder if he 'll do Bach ? There was a message just under the surface of the way she walked and the way she held her fork when they met for lunch , and the message warned of an obstacle to overcome . <p> He worried but not too much , because he was absolutely crazy about her . <p> Maybe the famous Aloysius Mann will play our song , Jack . She waited smiling for him to say , oh yeah , our favorite song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great man really did toot their song , would the classic cartoon from which Jack knew the song in the first place be playing in the background ? <p> Jack saw white hands pull open a slash in the darkness , some kind of curtain , and the ticket-taker said , " Watch your step on the way down . " <p> The flight of stairs up from the street seemed pointless now , because you had to go down another steep flight of stairs into a bowl below street level . The seats ran down half the bowl to a lighted stage . <p> At the top of the stairs , a young blond woman emerged , gleaming grin first , from the gloom and handed each of them a package about as big as a shoe box - some kind of device , metal and maybe rubber , in crinkly clear plastic . " There 's still lots of room down front , " she said and handed them each a program . " Please wait for instructions before you open anything . " <p> Jack and Lindsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the third row . They could have gotten seats right in the middle , but Lindsey said they would have the best view of Aloysius Mann 's fancy finger work if they were offset a little to the left . Most of the other listeners must have shared her assessment since the audience was definitely skewed to the left . <p> " What is this ? " Jack crinkled the clear plastic on his package . <p> Er ... how would I know ? Lindsay looked away quickly in a manner that told him she was withholding information , not exactly lying , okay , so she was lying , why mince words ? She was lying through her teeth , pulling the wool over his eyes , playing fast and loose with the facts . <p> The lights blinked , and then went out altogether . There was a long pause , and soon lots of grumbling and shifting about in the seats , but just before everyone panicked and stampeded for the only door , probably trampling to death the young and aged and just plain slow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thought maybe a bit of classical music would help , a spot lighted the stage . A moment later a woman dressed from waist to neck in a business suit and from waist to feet in jeans and sneakers , walked to a microphone , tapped it , and spoke . Jack thought she might be the same young woman who had handed him his package at the top of the stairs . <p> She said , " Tonight we are honored to present Aloysius Mann , who will favor us with selections from his unaccompanied repertoire for the flute . " <p> She paused for a smattering of applause , but she 'd misjudged their enthusiasm and there was a painful period of silence before she continued . " You will be happy to know that the apparatus you were issued when you entered the theater has been sanitized for your protection . " <p> Maybe she expected more applause , because she paused again until someone coughed . " Okay , " she said . " At this time , please open your packages . " <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them muttering as they turned the strange black objects around and around in their hands . He had , of course , followed instructions and not opened his package until told to do so . Judging by the sound of simultaneous cellophane ripping and crinkling , a fair number of other people had also followed instructions . <p> " Including you . Surprise , surprise , " he told Lindsey . <p> Oh , please , she replied with a look . <p> The apparatus turned out to be a classic gas mask-black and rubbery with clear plastic insect eyes and pig snout . Adjustable head straps . <p> " Let 's suit up , then . " The woman had a gas mask , too , and she was going to show them how to use it . " Adjust your straps like this , " she said . " Then put the mask to your face and secure it like this . " Her voice became muffled . " Now everyone turn to your right and make sure your neighbor 's head straps are secure . " <p> Lindsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a clandestine affair ( he supposed ) when he turned to his right and closely examined the back of the head and neck of the woman who had gotten her gas mask strap snagged on her ponytail . Jack reached forward and adjusted it and felt her tremble at his touch and said , " There ! That 's better . " <p> " What about the guys at the end of the rows ? " someone shouted . <p> " I was getting to that , " the woman said . " Now turn to your left and check your other neighbor 's straps . This is what we call ' double redundancy ' and is just one more thing we do for your safety . " <p> " Double ? " <p> Oh , never mind , Jack . The show 's about to start . <p> The woman said , " So , now I give you Aloysius Mann ! " She started the applause herself and backed off the stage to the left as a stagehand hurried in from the right with a music stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took the microphone with him as he left . <p> Everything went black . <p> Then the spotlight came on again , and the famous flute player was already there by the music stand . He looked to be in his early seventies . Bald with clouds of gray above his ears . Wrinkled brown suit . Silver flute . No gas mask . <p> He looked out at them and smiled . He lifted his instrument and began . <p> The opening was clear and pure and complex . Jack checked his program . It was n't easy to see it through the plastic lenses of his gas mask , but he was able to determine Mann was playing Bach 's " Partita in A minor . " <p> " Allemande , " he whispered to Lindsey . <p> " Shush , " someone said . <p> Hey , wait a minute . What was that at the end of the flute ? <p> Yes , there it was again - a puff of green gas from the end of the flute . <p> Definitely green gas , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas billowed from the end of the flute until it was n't easy to see the maestro . <p> " What the hell , " lack said . <p> Someone tapped him on the shoulder . " Please , do n't talk . " <p> Lindsey took his hand and communicated with little taps and squeezes thusly . <p> It 's such a sad story . Everyone realized very early that Aloysius was a prodigy . It was easy to see the boy could be one of the great musicians of all time . His family was supportive and allowed him time for practice and funds for the best schools . He was one of the youngest flutists in a prestigious school in Europe when he was not yet nine . Contests won . Impressive venues . Everything was coming up roses for young Aloysius Mann . <p> But then in his early teens , his breath went bad and even a little visible . He used sprays and chewed breath mints , but nothing helped much . He became a target for a good deal of mean-spirited teasing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music he made was phenomenal . <p> But by the time he turned twenty-five , he could no longer appear in public . It was the smell , not the sound , that drove his audience from the theaters , tears running down their faces and curses on their lips . <p> Had it not been for recorded music , he might have been a goner . <p> " It looks like he 's doing okay now , " Jack whispered . <p> Indignant throat clearing from the rear . Jack glanced back to see the black snout and glaring eyes of the man or woman behind him . He shrugged and smiled , but his smile was wasted in his own mask . <p> Aloysius Mann hit the high A of the Allemande , and the green gas rolled from the end of his flute like smoke from an oil fire . <p> People coughed at the sight of it . <p> By the time he hit the high A again on the repeat , it was easy to believe you might not be on Earth anymore . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . Maybe in the fifties when it rained all of the time . Instead , we might imagine we 're on a planet some twenty-three light-years from Earth with a similar atmosphere if you discount the gas produced by its inhabitants . <p> " What makes you say that ? " <p> Before he could be tapped and told to shut up again , the pause between the movements ended , and Aloysius Mann stepped into the Corrente . <p> It turns out , Lindsey continued , that the affliction came upon him slowly . By his forties , he could not be in the same room with people at all even when he was not producing the very considerable breath necessary for the flute . In fact , he could not get closer than about ten feet even outside . Nevertheless , with the judicious use of mouthwashes , breath sprays and mints , and room deodorizers , he managed to live a somewhat ordinary life . <p> Lately , though , record sales have diminished , and since he can not really take on students , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack like she wanted him to say something , but what could he say to such a story ? He looked to his right , but he could n't see the woman with the ponytail . <p> You could have cut the green air with a sword . Jack was glad to be holding onto Lindsey 's hand . Otherwise he would be alone with nothing but a brighter glow in the green where the flutist must be as he produced music that almost made it all worthwhile . Jack felt his body melt away until he was all ears and one hand holding onto Lindsey in the green clouds . <p> When the music stopped , she let go of his hand , and he experienced a moment of absolute panic . He was alone , lost in a green gas world of silence forever . He might have been swimming furiously , struggling , but he could n't feel his arms and legs . He might have made a sound . Some kind of undignified squeak . <p> But then he found her again , and she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about to start again , and it did . <p> The Sarabande , slow , smooth and amazing , and Jack settled into it like a gulp of air on surfacing while drowning or maybe coming back into the sunshine from a gloomy forest or like none of those things , silly , she said and said , I 've got a confession to make . <p> " Yes ? " <p> Aloysius Mann is my grandfather . <p> " What ? " <p> And he 's not really a man . <p> " Your grandfather is a woman ? " <p> No , I should have said he 's not human . Sorry for the sexist language . <p> She leaned in close and as her face came out of the green gas , he could see she was n't wearing her gas mask . He wants to meet you . That 's what this is really all about . <p> " And this green gas routine will happen to you , too , as you approach your thirties ? How come I have n't noticed it yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you will . <p> " And you 're from some place that is n't Venus in the fifties ? " <p> That 's right , and when it was clear that we would never leave this planet again , we had to change in order to survive . We made certain modifications so we could blend in , but there was only so much we could do , and it was n't entirely successful . When we did as much as we could to ourselves , we were down to just Grandpa and me as a newly modified baby . Everyone else had died . We 're the last of our kind , and Grandpa decided he simply could not die and leave me all alone , so he decided to change you people , too . Or at least one of you . For me . <p> " You mean ... ? " <p> That 's right , Jack , Grandpa beamed certain modifications at your parents even before you were conceived and later before you were even born , he did some more beaming . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack . We made you what you are , but we could n't tell if it would really work until now . <p> Aloysius Mann was deep into the Bourree Angloise now . <p> " How will we know if it worked ? " <p> You must take off your mask , Jack . <p> " What will happen ? " <p> Nothing . Or something wonderful . Or you 'll throw up , and we 'll have to go our separate ways . <p> She squeezed his hand . I 'm so afraid , Jack . <p> She sang a note that so perfectly matched her grandfather 's flute that the grumblers hidden in the green gas behind them must surely believe the voice to be part of this unusual performance , and as she sang the note , a tendril of purple gas drifted from her lips , first faintly then as vigorously as disturbed vipers and twisted through the green toward Jack . I 've arrived , Jack . <p> Smell me . <p> Jack let go of her hand and reached up to pull off his mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve . No matter what she smelled like , no matter how awful her grandfather 's gas was , he would not throw up . He would smile and smile and smile and breathe through his mouth for the rest of his life if it meant not losing her . <p> All he could see was her face floating in the green gas , a small sad smile , and the purple tendrils drifting from her lips . He pulled off his mask . <p> He took a tentative whiff . Not so bad . Would n't you say ? A little cheesy maybe . And somehow musical in a surefooted manner . He could get used to this - like sleeping next door to someone snoring . <p> Jack 's eyes were watering . <p> How are you ? she asked . <p> I 'm fine , he said . I think I 'm fine . <p> He rubbed the tears from his eyes and filled his lungs and felt his stomach lurch . He smiled at her , but his smile was tight , and she moved in until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . <p> He put his arms around her and felt her tremble . He kissed her neck , her cheek , closed each eye with a kiss , worried he was beating around the bush , kissed her nose , her lips , drew deeply her purple gas into himself . <p> He yelped and pulled away and the sound he made was low and rich and Aloysius Mann answered at once with a run of high notes ending in a spectacular trill . <p> Yes , while her grandfather 's gas might not be so easy to take , this was wonderful . He swooped back down before her disappointed frown had even gotten properly started and kissed her again . Rolling hills of yellow wild flowers rushed together to meet her waves of purple blossoms sweeping across the face of the Earth . <p> Her modifications were absolutely perfect . She was made for him . <p> But what about his modifications ? Had he been properly made for her ? What if she were choking back bile and this kiss was for her nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweaks had failed ? He pulled away a little and blew a canary yellow gas ring , and she laughed a laugh of such unqualified joy , and they came together again , and she filled his head and body . He said marry me , Lindsey , and she said yes , oh , yes , and we 'll make babies , and he said , yes , wonderful , fantastic , and she said our babies will take over the world and turn it into someplace that is n't like Venus in the fifties , and he said someday I 'll be the grandpa , but not too soon , she cautioned , and we 'll get a little house , he said , and she said with a yard where we can grow flowers . <p> We were made for each other . <p> There was wild applause . It was probably for Aloysius Mann , since he had finished the partita , but they chose to think it was for them . They snuggled together as close as they could get in the theater seats to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell him the good news . <p> They allowed themselves to become lost in the music , sometimes slicing the green air with a few purple and yellow notes of their own , but mostly listening and looking at one another , and at one point , her grandfather really did play their favorite song , and Jack still could n't identify it apart from the classic cartoon , but he did n't mention that . Some things are better left unsaid . <p> Author Affiliation
