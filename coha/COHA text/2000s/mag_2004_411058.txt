FEBRUARY 04 As the brightest planets begin to dominate the evening sky , no skygazer will be able to resist the beauty of this string of celestial pearls . // Venus in her blazing glory adorns the southwestern sky after sunset . The planet 's pure white light shines three times brighter than the ruddy beacon that was Mars late last summer . Looking through a telescope , you can feel the wonder that must have struck Galileo - Venus goes through phases like the Moon . This month , the size of the planet 's disk grows while its gibbous phase wanes toward a half-Moon figure . Photograph // Mark your calendars for January 24 and February 23 , when a slender crescent Moon lies near Venus . Arguably the best sight binoculars can deliver , these pairings are not to be missed . Look for earthshine filling in the rest of the Moon 's shape , which is aglow in sunlight reflected off Earth . Several more conjunctions between the Moon and bright planets will take place each month until late spring . The next pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southwest . Enjoy what you see with the naked eye because now that Earth has run well ahead in its orbit , Mars appears as a tiny blur through earthbound telescopes . Watch , as the ancients did , how Mars advances slowly across the sky night by night , closing in on the yellow gem Saturn . In terms of sheer visual impact in the eyepiece , no sight in the heavens can match Saturn and its rings . Mars may have a solid surface and Jupiter its ever-changing clouds , but observers continually and enthusiastically return to Saturn to re-energize their souls . Once it gets dark , Saturn lies above the worst of our atmosphere 's image-distorting turbulence . Check out " Saturn in prime time " in the January 2004 issue for observing tips . The Moon pairs with Saturn on both February 2 and 29 . The last pearl in our string to clear the horizon is the pale , peach-colored Jupiter . Resist the urge to observe it through our wavering atmosphere in mid-evening ; wait until midnight for a good look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purplebrown belts and four Galilean moons . From night to night , the moons form different patterns . You can see all of them on one side of Jupiter on the evening of the 9th . Of course , there is n't a real string connecting the planets , but they do seem to form a line . Imagine yourself as a grain of salt on a tabletop . If you had no depth perception , other salt grains on the table would appear to form a line . In the sky , this line is called the ecliptic and the tabletop is called the ecliptic plane . Get ready for a comet show this spring , when two bright interlopers grace our sky . Although the brightness of a comet is notoriously difficult to predict , both should be visible to the naked eye from a dark site . The first one , C/2002 T7 ( LINEAR ) , can be seen now in the evening sky with binoculars or a small telescope .

The stars above the map 's horizon now match what 's in the sky . // THE DEEP SKY Far beyond our solar system , the nearby stars , distant star clusters , and remote galaxies of the constellation Pegasus lurk . The great square Pegasus may be the mythological flying horse , but to most backyard observers , it 's a large , conspicuous square in the sky . Meteor watchers and deep-sky observers often use the square to find their limiting magnitude - how faint they can see without optical aid . Let your eyes adapt to the dark for thirty minutes or more , and then count the number of stars you see within the triangle formed by Alpha ( a ) Andromedae and Alpha and Gamma ( gamma ) Pegasi ( include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see down to magnitude 6.0 , but that number jumps to seventeen if your limiting magnitude rises to 6.5 . On exceptionally transparent nights far from any light pollution , your count could exceed thirty , indicating a limiting magnitude of 7.0 or higher . The International Meteor Organization has counts for other areas of the sky . Cluster : real or fake ? Imagine a river with a row of houses on either side . If we were floating on the river , the houses would appear to stretch out in a broad line in front of and behind us , except for those nearby - they would appear off to the side . That 's how it is with open star clusters and the Milky Way ; except for the ones nearby , like the Beehive , star clusters all hug the plane of the galaxy . Yet cluster NGC 7772 in Pegasus lies a good distance from the Milky Way but does n't seem that close to Earth because its brightest stars glow dimly around 12th magnitude . At low power , the cluster appears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 150x , and you 'll see ten stars through an 8-inch scope . But looks can be deceiving . In 2002 , researchers pegged this group of fourteen stars to be about 5,000 light-years away . They also believe it is 1.5 billion years old and in the process of dispersing . Astronomers think our Sun began in a similar small star cluster that dissipated long ago . Galaxies galore Much farther into the depths of space are the galaxies , each made up of billions of stars swirling slowly around a common center of gravity . If a bright comet had traversed this area of sky while Charles Messier was cataloging deepsky fuzzies , he probably would have found NGC 7814 . At magnitude 10.6 , this edge-on spiral galaxy is only a half magnitude fainter than the toughest Messier objects . NGC 7814 lies 2.6 westnorthwest of Gamma Pegasi , the anchor star for locating Comet C/2002 T7 ( LINEAR ) . Easily visible through a 10-inch scope at low power , the galaxy appears noticeably elongated . A couple decades ago , common , but incorrect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects . At low power , the core of NGC 7814 appears brighter , but not " stellar " like the cores of many galaxies . But pushing the power to 250x or more usually reveals the low contrast dust lane splitting the galactic bulge . Photograph SPIRAL GALAXY NGC 7814 lies in Pegasus , where it glows at 11th magnitude and appears edge-on from our point of view . PRESTON SCOTT JUSTIS // Halfway between NGC 7814 and Gamma Peg lies the fainter galaxy NGC 14 . At magnitude 12.1 , this round fuzz should be visible through an 8-inch scope , but you 'll probably need 125x or more to coax it out of the background sky . These galaxies are best seen when the Moon 's out of the evening sky , between February 10 and 22 . THE PLANETS The four brightest planets parade across the sky on these chilly winter evenings , providing wonderful views for both naked-eye and telescopic observers . The forecast for planet viewing in February looks good : Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn are all visible during the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that appears in the west at dusk . As the sky darkens , you 'll find Mars high in the southwest , looking like a bright orange star well above Venus . At the same time , Saturn stands high in the southeast among the stars of Gemini . jupiter rises a couple hours after the Sun sets and clears the murky horizon by mid-evening ; the solar system 's largest planet lies among the stars of Leo . As the sky darkens after sunset , Venus shines brilliantly in the west-southwest . Easily the brightest object in the sky ( except when the Moon 's out ) , Venus proves unmistakable . At magnitude - 4.1 , the planet easily overpowers the faint background stars of Pisces the Fish . To the naked eye , the most spectacular view occurs on February 23 , when Venus lies just 3 to the right of a slender crescent Moon . By the following night , the Moon has climbed some 12 above Venus . The distance between Earth and Venus shrinks throughout February , prompting changes in Venus 's appearance that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent diameter grows 20 percent during February , from 15 " on the 1st to 18 " on the 29th . With increasing size comes a drop in the fraction of the disk that appears illuminated . Although the phase remains gibbous , it wanes from 75 percent lit to 65 percent lit . If you think Venus looks great now , just wait a bit . For observers in the Northern Hemisphere , the planet has embarked on its best evening apparition in a decade . Over the next couple months , it will climb higher and shine brighter while its telescopic appearance changes radically . In marked contrast , Mars continues to fade in brightness and shrink in the eyepiece as its distance from Earth grows . The Red Planet dims 30 percent during February , from magnitude 0.7 to 1.1 , while its apparent diameter dwindles from 6.7 " to 5.7 " . The tiny disk requires a large telescope ( 12 inches in aperture or larger ) if you want to see any surface features . ( However , the planet 's 90-percent-lit phase still will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the starry background should be more interesting to observers now . The planet traverses most of Aries the Ram during February , well south of the constellation 's brightest stars . You can see the crescent Moon glide just 0.9 south of Mars on February 25 . The following evening , the seven-day-old Moon stands 5 below the Pleiades star cluster with Mars 11 below the Moon . By February 29 , Mars lies 13 below the Pleiades . Photograph Looking west-southwest 1 hour after sunset , February 23 Looking east 1 hour after sunset , February 2 // Because the orbital speed of Mars is not that much slower than Earth 's , the Red Planet will linger in the evening sky through early summer . While the outer planets like Jupiter and Saturn sink fairly quickly into the solar glare , Mars treks eastward relative to the stars fast enough to stay ahead of the twilight glow . During May , it will catch up with Saturn , resulting in a fine conjunction . Saturn stands high in the southeast as twilight ends . It 's a spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In mid-February , Saturn shines at magnitude - 0.2 and its disk spans 20 ' ' ' ' ; . Adding the rings brings the system up to 45 ' ' ' ' , about the same apparent size as Jupiter . With the southern face of the rings tipped 26 to our line of sight , any telescope will provide a stunning view . Photograph Saturn on February 24 , 11:00 P.M. EST // On both February 2 and 29 , Saturn lies about 5 south of a gibbous Moon . The planet spends the entire month near Mu ( ) and Eta ( eta ) Geminorum , the two 3rd-magnitude stars at the northwestern end of Gemini . Saturn nudges nearer to Mu as February progresses . By the 29th , the planet stands 1 shy of the star , the closest they will get . In the first week of March , Saturn ends its westward motion and begins to move back across Gemini . You 'll find the best views of Saturn in mid-evening , after twilight has ended and Saturn has climbed high in the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February and 8 P.M. late in the month . ) Although most beginners see nothing more than a bland yellow disk , experienced observers using modest-size telescopes typically see the bright Equatorial Zone sandwiched between the darker North and South Equatorial Belts . Even the smallest scope will show detail in the rings . Look for the black Cassini Division separating the outer A ring from the brighter B ring . On nights with steady seeing , you may glimpse the narrow Encke Gap near the outer edge of the A ring and the gauzy C ring closest to Saturn . Saturn 's brighter moons are always on display to those with a telescope . Titan , glowing at magnitude 8.3 , is the most obvious . Moons closer to Saturn , like Tethys , Dione , and Rhea , glow at 10th magnitude and can be glimpsed through a 6-inch scope . Enceladus poses a greater challenge at magnitude 11.7 . Farther from Saturn lies Iapetus , the moon that dims and brightens as it orbits the planet . It appears brightest on the western side of Saturn , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at magnitude 10.1 . As Iapetus moves east of Saturn , it fades by 80 percent to magnitude 11.9 . On February 1 , Iapetus lies 9 ' east of Saturn and glows dimly . Watch the moon brighten slowly as it moves westward relative to Saturn throughout this month and next . As Venus sinks low in the western sky , Jupiter rises in the east , where the brilliant planet lies near the hindquarters of Leo the Lion . It climbs 10 above the horizon by 9 P.M. in early February and by 7 P.M. toward month 's end . Jupiter shines at magnitude - 2.5 and appears stunning . Through a telescope , its large apparent size provides spectacular views of its ever-present cloud belts . Jupiter 's fast rotational period , less than ten hours long , offers different views of the planet each hour . You can watch features like the Great Red Spot cross the disk as the giant planet turns .

Photograph JUPITER SHINES BRIGHTLY this month as it approaches opposition . It rises during mid-evening and remains visible all night . SUBARU TELESCOPE/NAOJ // The four bright moons of Jupiter offer additional attractions as they orbit the planet . Io is the speedy one , orbiting in less than two days ; its position relative to the three other moons changes in a matter of hours . Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto move more sedately due to each moon 's increasing distance from Jupiter . That pretty much covers the visible planets this month . Both Uranus and Neptune reach solar conjunction ( on February 21 and 2 , respectively ) and are lost in the Sun 's glare . You might catch a quick glimpse of Mercury in early February ; for an observer at 40 north latitude , it lies 5 high in the southeast half an hour before sunrise . A telescope will show a gibbous disk some 5.5 ' ' ' across shining at magnitude - 0.2 . METEORS AND MOONS Callisto continues to play tag with the disk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features on the Moon 's eastern limb into view . No significant meteor shower takes place during February . The nightly rate of sporadic meteors - those that appear at random and are not associated with a shower - typically averages seven per hour . A " fireball " will appear rarely , lighting the sky with a brief but brilliant flash ; fireballs are magnitude -3 or brighter , outshining Jupiter . Probe the eastern limb Here 's a lunar challenge for you . Three features - Mare Marginis , Mare Smythii , and Neper crater - sit on the extreme eastern edge of the Moon , beyond Mare Crisium . The region often turns away from Earth , and lighting changes also complicate things for the observer . Try spotting the region shortly after the New Moon on February 20 , when that part of the Moon tips favorably in our direction . Only when the lunar libration is just right can these features be viewed easily . Photograph THE EASTERN EDGE of the Moon shows many interesting features under a favorable libration , including Mare Marginis ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crater Neper ( 3 ) . FROM THE CONSOLIDATED LUNAR ATLAS ( LPL/UA ) // Neper crater measures 85 miles across and has a prominent central peak and a flat crater floor filled with lava . It lies midway between Mare Marginis ( to the north ) and Mare Smythii ( to the south ) . Beyond Neper lies a smaller crater , Jansky , that 's even more difficult to view . The two maria often sit right on the limb , with Mare Marginis somewhat easier to see . Also look for the dark , fingerlike extensions that seem to reach from Mare Crisium toward Mare Marginis . Photograph Jupiter on February 7 , 2:00 A.M. EST // Jupiter 's satellites The rare series of occultations , eclipses , and transits involving the outer Galilean moon , Callisto , continue throughout February . During each twelve-year orbit of jupiter around the Sun , only two series of these Callisto events take place . The current one began in late 2001 and continues until September 2004 . During this time , sixty-six eclipses occur . February 's events listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal Time and Eastern Standard Time . Those that occur on either side of midnight are listed twice because the date changes for observers depending on whether they live in Europe or North America . Tr = transit ; I = ingress ; E = egress ; Oc = occultation ; Sh = shadow transit ; Ec = eclipse ; D = disappearance ; R = reappearance . The events are worth viewing due to their relative rarity . Not all the events can be seen from any one observing location . // FEBRUARY CALLISTO EVENTS // COMETS AND ASTEROIDS Comet C/2002 T7 ( LINEAR ) continues to brighten but will disappear in early March . Meanwhile , asteroid number one cruises through the sky not far from Saturn . Photograph // A binocular snowball If you 're a regular reader of this column , you already know that two naked-eye comets will provide an observing feast this coming spring . Comet C/2001 Q4 ( NEAT ) will vault tail-first into the evening sky in May , while the appetizer , C/2002 T7 ( LINEAR ) , will help us hone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binocular target this month , appearing as a 7th-magnitude white fuzzball . Although 7th magnitude may not sound thrilling compared with the comet 's predicted peak near 1st magnitude , comet observers know they 're lucky if they can get even one comet a year bright enough to see with binoculars . C/2002 T7 is perfectly placed in the evening sky during the first half of February , more than 30 above the western horizon when it 's fully dark . It 's a snap to find , too , because it lies near the 3rd-magnitude star Gamma ( gamma ) Pegasi . Just point your binoculars or finder scope at Gamma , the star marking the southeastern corner of the Great Square of Pegasus , and you 'll see the comet . Because the square now tilts on its end as seen from the Northern Hemisphere , Gamma appears to be the left corner . In case the season 's weather is poor , it 's probably best to look for the comet whenever it 's clear , even if the Moon is in the sky . The best conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Moon 's annoying glare will have left the evening sky . Moonlight returns to the stage after the 22nd . The comet 's tail , just visible through binoculars , will be much more evident when viewed through a telescope . C/2002 T7 already glows as bright as the Messier galaxy M81 , so you should see plenty of detail from a dark site . If the tail seems to be going the wrong way , you may have forgotten that your scope inverts the image of a celestial object . It 's always fun to see how far you can follow a comet 's tail . Use all your observing skills , from employing a dark hood to eliminate stray light to gently rocking your scope to detect the fainter parts of the comet 's tail . Pump up the power , too . Who knows what you 'll be able to see as you look toward the comet 's core ? Will there be curved jets like there were on Comet Hale-Bopp or a greenish glow and tail shadow like on Comet Hyakutake ? Photograph // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest object in the asteroid belt , yet it 's not the brightest . At 580 miles across , it 's almost double the size of either Vesta or Pallas , the runners-up . The difference lies in its reflectivity - almost four times less than that of Vesta . From a suburban backyard , you certainly will be able to follow Ceres 's movement using binoculars . Glowing at about magnitude 7.5 just a couple degrees south and east of 4th-magnitude Theta ( theta ) Geminorum , Ceres should be easy to pick out from the dearth of surrounding stars . The asteroid will confirm its solar system roots by moving relative to the background ; the nightly shift will be obvious through a small scope , but it may take three or four nights for those using binoculars to detect any change .
