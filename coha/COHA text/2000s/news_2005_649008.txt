<p> The best thing that could have happened to Joe Torre as a Yankee was winning right away . Torre won the World Series in 1996 , his first year as George Steinbrenner 's manager , and when he won it in three of the next four seasons , he became a legend , a future monument beyond the center-field wall in the Bronx . <p> But Torre has always known the downside of what his early Yankees teams accomplished . His aura and regard exceed any manager 's in the 32 years of Steinbrenner 's reign as the team 's principal owner . But the expectations are suffocating . <p> " Unfortunately , winning , in this organization , is a twofold thing , " Torre said yesterday , back in the Yankee Stadium dugout after a gloomy trip to Tampa Bay that left the Yankees tied for last place in the American League East , where they remained after a 6-3 loss to Oakland last night in 10 innings dropped them to 11-19 . " After you win four World Series in five years , anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Losing in the postseason is bad enough . Losing roughly two out of every three regular-season games is a catastrophe , and Steinbrenner  --  even with the pleasant distraction of having the favored horse , Bellamy Road , in today 's Kentucky Derby  --  has begun the verbal warfare that is subtly targeting his manager . <p> Torre may be too prominent and popular for Steinbrenner to fire . That may not stop Steinbrenner from running off a close ally of Torre 's , the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre . But Steinbrenner will not goad Torre into quitting . <p> Torre vigorously defended Stottlemyre yesterday , after Steinbrenner sideswiped the coach in an interview with USA Today . But Torre , who is in the first year of a three-year , $19.2 million contract , said he would not resign if Steinbrenner fired Stottlemyre . <p> " If I felt that way , I 'd be running away from all these guys , " Torre said , gesturing to the players on the field during batting practice . " That 's my obligation . " <p> Torre has managed bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Torre was not known as a winner until he joined the Yankees . But this season has presented a new challenge . The Yankees have not been in last place this late in a season since 1995 . <p> " The first thing that happens when things are going bad is you lose perspective , " reliever Mike Stanton said . <p> " That 's one of the great abilities Joe has , is to help people keep everything in perspective  --  not belittle it , but keep it in perspective . " <p> It is Steinbrenner 's prerogative to be impatient ; he is the one spending more than $200 million on the team . It is Torre 's job to remind his players that they still have 80 percent of the season to play . These days , it is also Torre 's job to troubleshoot . <p> " We have to be prepared to deal with the extra things , whatever gets thrown our way , " General Manager Brian Cashman said . " Clearly , when you start playing the way we 've played , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon you . " <p> Steinbrenner , who loves to reminisce about his days as an assistant football coach at Northwestern and Purdue , has always been restless about his coaching staff . Just days after the Yankees lost the 2003 World Series to the Florida Marlins , he fired Rick Down , the hitting coach . Steinbrenner is fretting about the pitching now , and about Stottlemyre 's ability to fix it . <p> " Time is getting shorter , " Steinbrenner told USA Today . " Our pitchers are not improving . That 's what a pitching coach is supposed to do  --  make your pitchers improve . " <p> Steinbrenner did not name Stottlemyre or specify what action he might take , but pitching was clearly his concern . " We 're just not getting the pitching , " he said . " I do n't know whether we have to think of some changes there or what . " <p> Torre said it " crosses the line " for Steinbrenner to blame Stottlemyre , who has been the pitching coach since 1996 . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stottlemyre , one of the most honorable people and one of the most talented pitching coaches and one of the most loyal guys I know , " Torre said . <p> Asked if he planned to tell that to Steinbrenner , to whom he has not spoken in almost a month , Torre said : " If I have to communicate that to George , then I do n't think I can communicate that to George . If people are n't aware of that just from watching this ball club for 10 years , then they have n't been paying attention . " <p> Stottlemyre said he was not aware of Steinbrenner 's comments , but that Steinbrenner was entitled to his opinion . He has seen another coach who was close to Torre , Don Zimmer , resign over a dispute with Steinbrenner , and he has learned to live without job security . <p> " Anybody that coaches here and has that fear does n't belong here , " Stottlemyre said . " The track record here with coaches  --  I 've been here maybe longer than I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I do n't think you can ever worry about that and do your job . " <p> Stottlemyre , 63 , has said that this would probably be his final year . He nearly retired after the 2002 season , but the pitchers ' implosion in a playoff loss to the Angels motivated him to return . Since then , he has tried to nurture an ever-changing rotation . <p> " One of the challenges I have in my job is to get new people adjusted to our program , " Stottlemyre said . " I ca n't really say that I prefer it , but I certainly do n't turn my back on it . It is a little bit extra work , but I do n't mind . " <p> Some of the new pitchers have not improved ; the departed Jeff Weaver , Javier Vazquez and Jose Contreras never became aces in pinstripes . Still , with no individual pitcher winning as many as 15 games last season , Stottlemyre coaxed 101 victories from the staff . <p> With three new starters this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's game , the Yankees ' pitching staff had allowed opponents a .306 batting average , the highest in the majors . The Yankees ' 5.12 earned run average was the third worst in the A.L. , to Texas ' 5.15 and Tampa Bay 's 5.94 . Steinbrenner might have a point . <p> " He can say whatever he wants , " starter Mike Mussina said . " He can change whatever he wants to change . We 're not pitching the way we thought we could . I do n't think we 're hitting the way we thought we could . We 're not playing defense the way we thought we could . So you put all of that together , and you end up with what we have . " <p> What they have is a team falling far short of expectations , which can place an even heavier burden on a flailing group of players . Stanton spent the previous two seasons with the Mets , and when he rejoined the Yankees , he seemed relieved to be away from the negativity in Flushing , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " When you have the media coverage and the fan base that the New York teams have , and when you do n't meet expectations , New Yorkers are n't exactly known for holding their tongues anyway , and that can make for some tough times , " Stanton said . " But no one 's more upset about how we 've played than us . " <p> Suddenly , the Mets seem to have more long-term hope than the Yankees , who began the week as the oldest team in the majors . Most Yankees are on the downside of their careers , while the Mets have young , rising stars in Carlos Beltran , Jose Reyes and David Wright . <p> Beltran preferred the Yankees over the Mets , and his agent , Scott Boras , badly wanted the Yankees to bid for him in free agency last winter . But Steinbrenner was determined to fix the pitching , and the contracts for Randy Johnson , Carl Pavano and Jaret Wright cost him $109 million . <p> Steinbrenner never made an offer to Beltran , just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2003 , even though Cashman wanted him . Guerrero won the Most Valuable Player award for the Angels last year ; the free agent the Yankees signed , Gary Sheffield , was the runner-up . <p> Johnson , 41 , is 2-2 with a 3.74 E.R.A. and missed his last start with a sore left groin . <p> He dismissed age as a reason for the Yankees ' plight , citing the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks as a comparison . <p> " We were said to be too old , one injury away from the season being over , " Johnson said . " But everybody pulled together and we did some great things . " <p> What they did was defeat the Yankees in the World Series , beginning a maddening era of unrealized expectations . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
