Summer is almost over . What do you plan to do before school starts again ? In one neighborhood nine-year-old Bryan hopes to go camping with his dad and catch lots of fish . Erin , who is one year older , wants to practice her roller-skating and win the softball tournament . Eleven-year-old Danny plans to read some good books and get lots of sleep . And all three of them want to swim as much as they can in the nearby lake . But before they take another plunge , they need to review safety rules . " Who cares about some silly old rules ? I can swim ! " Bryan says when his mother asks his friends and him whether they know all the things they should know about swimming rules . " I care ! " exclaimed Erin . " You were n't here last summer when a girl almost drowned in the lake . She thought she could swim all the way across it , but then she got tired and panicked . The lifeguard had to row a boat out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of safety , " Danny added . " Know your abilities and limitations . You should n't think you can do more than you really can , and you should n't swim too soon after eating or when you are tired or overheated . " // " She did n't remember the second rule , either , " said Erin . " Use the Buddy System . You should always swim with someone else . If one of you gets into trouble , the other one can help . " " What rules are you talking about ? " asked Bryan . " The five swimming safety rules that the lifeguard taught us last summer , " answered Erin . " He even told us a simple way to remember them : Know your ABC 's , and do n't roughhouse or fake it . " " What does that mean ? " Bryan 's mother asked . " I 'll show you , " Danny replied . He found pencil and paper on the table and wrote down these words : Ability of yourself Buddy System Condition of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued . " C is for the condition of the swimming area . " " That 's right , " Erin added . " Whether you 're in a pool , a lake , or at the ocean , you should think about where you are swimming . Is it shallow or deep ? Is the bottom smooth , or is it rough and snaggy ? There might even be weeds or water currents that would make it hard for you to swim ! " " That 's a lot to remember ! " exclaimed Bryan . " Not if you think of ABC : Ability , Buddy , Condition . Then it 's easy ! " Danny assured him . " What were the other safety hints ? " asked Bryan 's mother . Danny added to the written list : Do n't roughhouse or fake it . Then he summarized : " You should n't play rough games , such as dunking others , running around a pool , or throwing sharp or heavy objects . Someone might get hurt . " " And never pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , " Erin added . " The lifeguard will be risking his own safety to help you . You might cause another nearby swimmer to panic and get hurt . And if you fake trouble just once , the lifeguard would never again be really sure if you needed help . Even if you did , he might not believe you at first . " " I guess you 're right . It is good to know a few swimming safety rules , " said Bryan . They 'll make swimming more fun , because you probably wo n't ever have trouble if you follow them . And they 're easy to remember with your hints . " They sure are ! " agreed Erin . " Simple as ABC ! " // <p>
