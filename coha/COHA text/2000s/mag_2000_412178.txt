Period charm is enhanced by using flame as the primary lighting . The fountain , acquired in France , is a reproduction of ancient street corner watering places in Provence . Photograph // The richness of Louisiana history permeates this charming outdoor room . Majestic live oaks provide the classic Southern frame for this picturesque garden . Courtyard walls of softly faded brick enclose paved and planted spaces with a European flair . Bananas , palms , and gingers spill over in tropical luxuriance . American and old-world influences come together for perfection in Herb and Nan Boydstun 's Baton Rouge backyard . Their property already boasted live oaks deserving of historic markers . These trees are so grand that they have been a favorite backdrop for local weddings . The Boydstun 's house is Louisiana Creole in style , designed by architect Al Jones and built by Larry Normand . It 's what Herb and Nan happily describe as " an American house with a lot of French influence . " Descendants from the original French settlers of Louisiana , Creoles were known for their strong interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boydstuns . They 're originally from Mississippi but have lived in Louisiana all their married life . " We 're hoping to stay permanently in Baton Rouge , " says Nan . " This is a really friendly town , and it fits perfectly with all our interests . " The Boydstuns adore both European antiques and tropical plants , so the warm , multicultural atmosphere of Baton Rouge offered them a perfect opportunity to combine the two . When their house was almost finished , they consulted landscape designer Michael Hopping to ensure that the French flair continued in their back garden . Photograph // " For this large a home , it 's not a very deep yard , " says Nan , " but we do n't have anybody who needs to play football in the backyard anymore . We wanted some way to use the fountains we 'd purchased on a trip to France , and we knew we wanted a lot of banana trees . " Because they also needed privacy and a place to entertain , Michael 's inspiration was to create a walled courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His attention to historic detail has kept the Creole feeling woven throughout the garden . " We do have an earned right , from the 18th century , to be a little more European here in South Louisiana , " Michael explains . " I think of it as not unlike a recipe for gumbo-a hodgepodge of ingredients-blending textures and flavors of what it 's like living in this historic place and the hot , wet climate that we love to create a marvelous result . " For Michael 's garden gumbo , bananas , elephant's-ears , and a short allee of crepe myrtles are surrounded by angled courtyard walls that match the Old New Orleans Red brick of the house . The sunny fountain on the terrace is splashed with bright annual flowers in pots . Trills of birdsong compete with the gurgling water . Several brick-edged planting beds support shady Drake elms . Michael compiled a dramatic palette of contrasting tropical and semitropical vegetation to create the effect he sought here . " What 's really important is using plants that work in the landscape of South Louisiana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not creating a horticultural wonderland . " It 's clear that instant gratification is something that does work here , because the lush garden is just a few years old . " Exuberance is from the choice of plant materials , not from the size of specimens . Except for the crepe myrtles and Drake elms , it was all little stuff , " says Michael . Taking the Boydstuns ' pleasure in entertaining into account , Michael added the pavilion and its outdoor fireplace to make it possible to be in the garden even in cool weather . Then he filled in beautifully around the courtyard 's central features with flat , quarried rock similar to the old ballast stones used to pave French Quarter courtyards . He also helped set a more primitive atmosphere with flame . Gas lanterns around the courtyard walls enhance the old-world feel , with electric lighting used sparsely and indirectly . Finally , Michael chose genuine French olive jars as accents . Used to store perishables on long sea voyages from Europe , they are another tie with the history of this port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the word ' lagniappe , ' " Michael says . " A little something extra . " The delicious outcome is a garden courtyard that elegantly mixes old and new , French and American , in the best Creole style . In addition , it provides plenty of comfort for both the Boyd  --  stuns and their guests . " Anything we do in this garden , we just do for the pleasure of it , " Nan says , leaning back comfortably . " Herb and I often come out here before dinner in the early evening . That 's when the angel 's trumpets open their blooms , and their fragrance fills the air . We give lots of parties , but we enjoy this wonderful space the most with our family and close friends . Our courtyard is such a good place to visit and talk .
