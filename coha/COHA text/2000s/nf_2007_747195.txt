Wandering the streets of Paris , the walker may mark his passage by the ironwork arcades that served as gathering places . With vaulted halls and open interiors , one element of their beauty is in their structure ; another is in the wear of the past , the human and material exchange that has filled the space they mark . The poems of Correspondence , Kathleen Graber 's remarkable debut volume , bear such a beauty in long lines and slow cadences that make space for working out the connections between making meaning , making self and making art . And the voice , that revelation of consciousness particular to these poems , feels like a live-feed of " the sound of mind " ( Louise Glck ) as it filters and is filtered by the world . <p> Correspondence is a restless meditation on the necessity of the work of art , not the artifact but its making , the aesthetic effort in which the artist becomes conscious of her passage through the flux of self and world . The concerns of the poems are located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district of exchange between content that washes up and context that washes away , each exchange momentary , undoing and becoming undone . Like another shoreline poet , Matthew Arnold , Graber questions the role of faith in a faithless world ; her perspective , however , differs . Arnold mourns what is lost as faith withdraws , whereas one and a half centuries later , from the east coast of New Jersey , Graber examines gains as well as losses by studying correspondence , the junctures and disjunctions of self , language and art in an age of mechanical reproduction . Drawing freely from her sources , which include Walter Benjamin , " the woman / behind the counter at Unique Copy Center , " Franz Kafka , Jimi A. who sent a postcard from Artesia , New Mexico , Anais Nin , and Ludwig Wittgenstein , Graber 's poem-making illustrates what Wittgenstein asserted : use renders meaning . She reinvents , decontextualizes and recontextualizes fragments of quotations , scenes of daily life , objects , images and memories , recasting them to advance the thought of each poem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to create context for the making of art . Correspondence could be considered a collection of lyric essays cast as poems that assay ( try , test , sample , rehearse ) the action of thought and desire on the things of the world . <p> The speaker of Correspondence is the collector described in its epigraph as one who " . takes up the struggle against dispersion . struck by the confusion , by the scatter , in which the things of the world are found " ( Walter Benjamin quoted in Correspondence ) . The poems themselves are acts of gathering , the accumulation , collation , deletion , and reinterpretation that mark a passionate collector . On the one hand , they are filled with content , with stuff : " the mower , the buried bone , the hubcap / . seven busted up rowboats / a long way from the sea . " On the other hand , that content is unmoored from its original purpose and reassembled into something else , the way a word , dislodged by use from what it signifies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Between Laurelton &; Locust Manor , " asks , " Is n't this art , this careful arrangement of what is / useless ? " and then stakes the claim of the collection : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Subsequent poems in the first section return to the question of faith and introduce other principle concerns : longing and loss ; collection and assemblage . They also introduce the subjects of the other sections : women ; science ; fragmentation ; and perspective . A long meditative poem , " The Letters : A Mnemonic for Forgetting , " completes the design ; its five parts are dispersed through the book . Each one , subtitled with a letter , becomes the coda of a section . The letters themselves arc a single word broken into pieces : a code . Code and coda . To read Correspondence is to assemble and reassemble its parts , the reader becoming the book 's other maker , a co-respondent in the realignment of image , language , memory , and thought . <p> One may argue ( correctly ) that this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the design of Graber 's collection lifts that action into consciousness much as the assemblage of Joseph Cornell 's boxes lifts into consciousness and reveals the act of seeing . In " Romantic Museum , " storage containers call to mind Cornell 's boxes assembled from " . almost worthless windfall / never meant to last , " cast-offs that he aligns into fragmented narratives and shrunken scenes that provoke the viewer to make meaning . " What is it in you I sidle beside ? " this poem asks in a grammar one must read through more than once to understand . What is it in the reader the poems slide furtively against to create meaning ? Graber interrogates the transitory nature of these meanings in poems that are themselves like Passagen-Werk , those early iron structures built to serve transitory purposes : railroad stations , exhibitions , the Parisian arcades that she , following Benjamin , explores and re-wrights . The writing and the wrighting refashion the self ; they are the Passagen-Werk of evolving identity , each poem a marker of passage , a temporary stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not a central concern of Correspondence . Instead , Graber is concerned with the effects of passage itself , of which time is merely a marker . In a poem that bears the title of Benjamin 's essay , " The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction , " she samples various meanings of " reproduction , " including mammalian : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This recital of fact expands into a consideration of how language , that so human construction , blocks the self from perceiving the selves she has been : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> " Rhetoric " and " syntax " point to the relationships between words , not words as fixed signs but their use . When speaking of oneself , the only language available is the language of the present self because language , despite word root and etymology , is an expression of context , of thought passing through this moment . For Graber , context continuously washes away . The poem stops here : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> If every single self-conception , idea , object , image , act of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of passage itself . <p> Like the route of bees heading for sweetness ( " The Language of Bees " ) , these poems are navigations . They do not seek an equilibrium or a resting place for content , which , as material , will accrete and deteriorate , shift and recombme into other than its present state : Instead , they trace routes of the mind quickening as it moves through the world . The action of the final poem toward which all of Correspondence tends , resolves in perception that momentarily attaches to an image of a fish melting on hot pavement . Like a free radical attaching to a molecule , perception is at the same time poised to detach , looking toward a distant image , " another shore : " PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In this indeterminate final image is a motion toward faith as a perspective directed at " another shore . " Where Arnold 's " Dover Beach " turns toward love to counterbalance the " . melancholy , long , withdrawing roar " of the " Sea of Faith " as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by night , " Graber 's poem passes over the ache of " sorrow " and the ache of " love " as " . common &; un-tragic . " The poem and the book draw to a close in " yellow light . " Not a place , not a space , but a momentary context for a change of state , for the chance of other assemblages . In its clarity and embrace , in its articulation of making and maker , in its unmuddled transport of mind into language , Correspondence is a vital , wholly original work of art . <p> By J. C.
