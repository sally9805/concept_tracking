<p> The lush , aggressive weed that " grows like the devil " and just will not die is manna for sheep , cows and folks who use it to cure hangovers , weave baskets and make jelly <p> Deep in a west georgia forest , lloyd Hood is battling kudzu . The fragrant , fast-growing weed infests an ever-expanding swath of the American South , including several thousand acres of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ' West Point Project , where Hood does landscape maintenance . The area has suffered a severe drought for several years , but the kudzu here is lush and green all the same . Kudzu always seems to be lush and green . <p> " I do n't think it hinders kudzu whether it 's dry or wet , " Hood mutters as we bushwhack through vine-draped red yaks , yellow pop-lars and loblolly pines . " It still grows like the devil . " A number of the vines have gnarled , bark-covered trunks the thickness of a person 's arm that climb high into the tree canopy above us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such dim light . It takes me a while to realize that much of the canopy shading us is kudzu . With a long-handled bush ax , Hood whomps a thick brown vine snaking along the ground , a vine that bears signs of earlier cutting . " It does n't look like it , but it 's alive ! " he says between whacks . " You think you 've killed it , but it just keeps coming back . That 's what makes it so dangerous . " <p> Over the past century , kudzu ( rhymes with " mud zoo " ) has become a mythic feature of the Southern landscape . The vine and its overlapping , plate-size leaves shroud buildings , trees , billboards , broken-down trucks and anything else too slow to get out of the way . Pueraria montana reaches top speed in late spring and early summer , when its supple green shoots can grow nearly a foot a day . Road crews are forever battling the weed as it climbs up utility poles , sometimes shorting out electric connections , and crawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green mash under a train 's wheels . <p> Yet people down South have a certain fondness for the weed . " It 's who we are . It 's our destiny , " sings the cast in Kudzu : A Southern Musical , based on the comic strip by Pulitzer Prize winner Doug Marlette . Southerners write poetry about it , name their pets after it and film mock-horror movies about it ( Kurse of the Kudzu Kreature and Kudzula ! among them ) . They give it nicknames : the green scourge , the weed that ate the South , the cuss-you vine , Jack-and-the-beanstalk , and foot-a-night . And they tell jokes about it . The proper way to plant kudzu ? Drop the seeds and run like hell . <p> " Kudzu fits into the South 's gothic tradition , " says University of Mississippi historian Charles Reagan Wilson , director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture . " It dies off for much of the year , then blooms again and spreads , overgrowing everything . It fits the image of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eden , which from the beginning was the way that Europeans saw the American South . " But in that lushness lurks danger , he adds . " It 's like the image of the Southern bayous : they may be romantic , but they 're deadly if you get lost in them . " <p> Up close , kudzu is a lovely plant . Native to East Asia , kudzu has been used for centuries there to make tea , health tonics and fibers for kimonos . Kudzu first arrived in this country as an ornamental vine shading the Japanese pavilion at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . It slowly caught on as a porch vine in the South , offering welcome shade and a delightful aroma when it blossomed . The trouble is , kudzu tends to grow where it wants to grow . Aided by a warm , moist climate , a long growing season and human carelessness , the vine and its large , flat leaves today blanket some seven million acres of real estate , an area roughly the size of Massachusetts . Kudzu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carolinas . <p> In my roamings around the South , I 'm often transfixed by the spectacle of rampant kudzu . Roadside trees resemble a weird topiary with a nubbly green surface . The drooping , vaguely menacing shapes-kudzu kreatures ! - look frozen in place as though green gunk had just fallen from the sky and draped everything , transforming the scene as completely and magically as an early-morning blizzard transforms a familiar city street . The vines fill vacant lots in downtown Atlanta and entangle mailboxes in rural South Carolina ( although homeowners always carve an opening in the foliage so the mail can get through ) . Here and there , you see adjacent front lawns , one well tended , the other abandoned to waist-high kudzu . Oddly , the neglected lot , being uniformly green and attractively lush , appears at a glance to be the cultivated one . <p> Once , kudzu was known throughout the South as the miracle vine . The Department of Agriculture paid farmers in the 1930s up to eight dollars an acre to plant kudzu on their land to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants in the 1930s and ' 40s from nurseries in Georgia and Alabama . Leading the blitz was the Alabama Polytechnic Institute , now called Auburn University . <p> " For a while , kudzu was a salvation for folks who had eroded land and nothing to feed their livestock , " explains Jim Miller , a U.S. Forest Service ecologist , when I visit his office at Auburn . Miller shows me old scrapbook photographs he salvaged that were taken before his day , when kudzu was being groomed as the savior of the South . One picture shows a barren , heavily eroded gully whose contours remind me of the Grand Canyon . Another frames two little girls posing like Munchkins in Oz amid a sea of undulating kudzu . <p> Miller is a slow-talking man who punctuates his speech with long sighs as though resigned to a grim future . He likens kudzu today to a foreign army of occupation , one whose relentless onslaught we 're doing woefully little to stop . Over a period of years , he used to visit a spot in nearby Tallapoosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take pictures of kudzu attacking a grand old oak like wolves on a wounded moose . " Kudzu vines do n't just drape a tree , " he says . " A vine will go up and then come back down , twining around itself , and go back up again . " Besetting the old oak , the corkscrewing vines were like springs under tension . " Finally , they pulled that tree all the way down . " <p> Even if kudzu were made Public Enemy Number One , it would n't be easy to stop . An herbicide named Transline works fairly well , but a single gallon of concentrate runs $300 , and it takes several treatments over years to eradicate an acre of the weed . You can kill it by mowing it regularly for four or five years-if your land 's not too rough , the vines are n't too thick and you 've got the energy . Digging up the roots is an excellent tactic . Unfortunately , a 20-year-old plant that 's never been cut back can have a single root weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backhoe . John Byrd , a professor of weed science at Mississippi State University , has just begun a five-year test of various herbicides for kudzu . Already , however , he 's found a surefire way to kill the weed . " I had two test plots over in Oxford , " he tells me in a deep , leisurely drawl , " and they 're going to put a big Super Wal-Mart on one of them . " Oh , yeah , that 'll take care of the problem for sure . <p> In truth , the most promising way to fight any invasive alien pest , whether kudzu or water hyacinth or melaleuca , is to bring over the natural enemies that keep it from running amok in its land of origin . The right insects and fungi can control even the most monstrous of monster weeds . At North Carolina State University , entomologist David Orr is trying to find a biocontrol for kudzu . <p> " Kudzu is totally out of control in this country , so it 's doing an unnatural thing : it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow dirt road through a 20-acre kudzu patch right on the Raleigh campus . A few years ago , Hurricane Fran damaged or killed many of the trees that edged this kudzu patch ; now the weed is finishing the job . " It 's become a black hole for biodiversity , " he says as we pass through the silent expanse of uniform green . Orr is a lanky , affable 41-year-old who grows Venus's-flytraps in a bog near his house as a hobby . With collaborators in China , kudzu 's ancestral home , he 's looking at a large beetle that zeros in on the roots . ( It has n't made it to the United States and wo n't until the beetle demonstrates that related items like soybeans wo n't become part of its meal plan . ) Kudzu 's most important natural enemy in China may well be human beings , Orr says . " Everywhere we went there , we saw people cutting kudzu vines , which they use as rope . " In the fall , people comb the hillsides to dig up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an age-old popular hangover remedy . <p> Oddly enough , kudzu already has well-established natural enemies here in the United States . As we get out and wade into the kudzu patch , Orr yanks on a vine and shows me a pod of large , flattish seeds hidden under the foliage . Several have been punctured , probably by thirsty stinkbugs . " Over 90 percent of kudzu seeds in this country are killed by insects , mostly natives , " he says . Kudzu , in fact , rarely sprouts from seed ; it usually grows from roots . " The main way kudzu gets spread around is n't by birds or by wind but by human activity , like construction and road-building . " Both are growth industries in many areas of the South . " All you need is one root in a truckload of fill , and you have a new kudzu infestation . " Given kudzu 's reputation , Orr is amazed by people who want to spread it to new places . " One fellow contacted us looking for 1,000 pounds of kudzu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow kudzu for the elephants there . " <p> In fact , a certain breed of Southerner-a distinct minority , to be sure-has long believed we should be exploiting kudzu 's good points . A weed is just a plant growing in the wrong place , after all . The first evangelists of kudzu harvesting were Charles and Lillie Pleas , who in the early 1900s mailed out kudzu seedlings and root crowns from a small nursery in Chipley , Florida , to buyers looking for a fast-growing forage crop for their livestock . In 1943 a flamboyant newspaper columnist and radio personality named Channing Cope founded the short-lived Kudzu Club of America , which sponsored kudzu festivals and planting contests . " Cotton is n't king here anymore ! " he proclaimed . " Kudzu is king ! " After Cope died in 1962 , kudzu enveloped his farm in Covington , Georgia , front porch and all . <p> Parks superintendent Larry Schenk of Tallahassee is no fan of kudzu , but he , too , thinks the plant may as well be used to advantage . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now covered in kudzu , he says . " It 's devastating . It 's overtopping 100-year-old live oaks and killing them . " Spraying does not work : Transline is banned throughout Florida as a groundwater pollutant . The solution ? A shepherd and 300 special kudzu-eating sheep . The five-year , state-supported kudzu control project , begun last spring , is the brainchild of a New Hampshire company called Bellwether Solutions , which uses sheep up North to control weeds in hard-to-reach places under power lines . If it works , Schenk thinks a Southern sheep-farming revival may be in the offing . " The sheep are loving the kudzu , " he says . " This could be a way for small farmers to fatten up their animals with free food and at the same time eradicate a pest plant . " <p> For the hard-core kudzu enthusiast , however , the plant deserves better than being eaten by animals . That 's certainly the viewpoint of Edith Edwards of Rutherfordton , North Carolina . " Eating kudzu is what 's keeping me young , " the 73-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The occasion is the annual " Krazy With Kudzu ! " weekend , held on a cliffside terrace in Chimney Rock Park in the craggy kudzu-covered hills of western North Carolina . Her philosophy is : it 's here , so why not use it ? As bemused tourists mill about , Edwards , a lively woman wearing a giant hat woven from green kudzu vines , offers for sale woven-kudzu baskets and kudzu Christmas trees ( a best-seller ) , packaged kudzu root starch , kudzu-blossom jelly and syrup , and other hard-to-find items . She herself takes a spoonful of kudzu powder daily in a glass of cool liquid and uses crumbled kudzu leaves as a broccoli substitute in casseroles . " And if you cut yourself , you take a little bit of this root starch and wrap it on the cut with a little water , and you do n't get a scar . " <p> Operating a deep-fat fryer on a nearby table , Gordon and Deany Martin are serving french-fried kudzu to all comers . The smallish batter-dipped leaves are sprinkled with grated Parmesan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlic and Parmesan , actually . Kudzu 's reputation being what it is , the Martins have to work to get many of the onlookers to put the cooked weed in their mouths . " It 's better than potato because you do n't have to peel it , " Deany explains to a couple in their 30s . <p> " Phil , you 've got to taste that . " <p> Phil happily obliges . " That 's good ! " he says after chewing a moment . " Honey , we been wasting it on the goat all this time . " From her reaction , his wife appears unconvinced . <p> Edith Edwards ' husband Henry , meanwhile , a farmer with a deep-furrowed , sun-burned face , gives a small knot of listeners some advice on kudzu baling . " The secret is cutting it low and baling it high , " he says in a patient singsong . " Otherwise , the vines tangle up your baler . " Edwards tells me his dairy cows have set county records for milk production thanks to kudzu silage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fence between kudzu and cattle " - and so does he . " When you drive through our countryside , which is so dry right now , the fields all burned up , and you come to a beautiful lush kudzu field , you just want to roll in it . Oh , yeah . " <p> One of Edwards ' kudzu-bale customers is Nancy Basket , a part-Cherokee artist and basketmaker who lives in nearby Walhalla , South Carolina . She used the dried bales as walls for the restored barn where she has a studio . " It makes great insulation , " she says as she shows me around after the festival . On her front porch are cut kudzu vines that she 'll split to make baskets . Behind the barn , a bale has been steeping in a barrel of water for almost a year . She 'll use it to make dyed paper for her cut-paper artwork : brightly colored still lifes , street scenes , paper quilts . <p> Basket is a good-natured , rather eccentric woman with braided black hair and a storyteller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels a reverence toward all living things , she says , but she 's not averse to whacking a little kudzu to protect the already vine-tangled mimosas behind her barn . At the moment , the kudzu is in full bloom . Two-toned purple blossoms hide primly under the curling leaves , filling the air with a grape-scented perfume . The vines on her property , I notice , are scaling not only the barn and the woods out back but also the walls of her house . The bedroom window is open a crack . Looking up , I see a thin green tendril curling right inside , flowers and all . " Every few days , it grows right in , " Basket says to me in a stage whisper as though beginning a ghost story . " My mom used to snip it off and would never tell me . I would just find the little cut pieces . " <p> Kudzu is a restless plant . Whether we welcome its probing shoots or not , it keeps advancing , aggressive and wily , into new and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight and a little moisture into subterranean reservoirs of root starch , which fuel the next advance . Yankees like me may feel aloof and a little smug about our Southern brethren 's kudzu problem , but perhaps we should n't any longer . Kudzu has moved north . <p> In a large cluttered room filled with scuffed metal cabinets , Les Mehrhoff , curator of the University of Connecticut 's herbarium in Storrs , slides open a shallow specimen tray . Lying on stiff paper inside are the pressed leaf and stem of a kudzu plant found growing in New Haven 22 years ago . " I saw it myself in 1978 , " Mehrhoff tells me . " It was climbing up a wall behind a natural-foods store . " Maybe , he guesses , someone once tossed out an empty sack of organic peanuts from Georgia , and a few kudzu seeds inside managed to germinate in the trash pile . <p> There are other kudzu infestations in the Northeast . On Long Island , there 's a dune in Shoreham that 's covered with kudzu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southold . Vines have been sighted climbing trees yext to a Chinese restaurant in Kingston , Massachusetts . With the past three winters in the United States being the warmest ever recorded , kudzu may be finding the climate up North more to its liking . Or maybe , just maybe , kudzu itself is changing . Says Mehrhoff , " It 's only a matter of time before a kudzu seed carrying cold-tolerant genes germinates , grows up and proliferates nonstop . " Mutant kudzu ! Dixie 's revenge ! <p> The Edge of the Woods natural-foods store in New Haven is now a small grocery store , the Edgewood Super Market , on a quiet corner just west of downtown . On the sunny September afternoon I visit , the small gravel lot behind the store looks like a slice of south Georgia . Kudzu , bushy and green , covers the chain-link fence and reaches three feet into the air above the barbed-wire top . In an alley beside the apartment building next door , sheltered from the wind and warmed by sunlit brick , the kudzu is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dandelions , no ragweed , no crabgrass . If it 's green , it 's kudzu . <p> As I snoop around , the apartment superintendent , Walter Horowiec , shows up . Keys hang in bunches from the belt of his blue workpants , and he wears the stub of a pencil behind one ear . No , he 's never heard of kudzu , but he hates it . " This stuff is brutal , " he says . " I mean , tug on this . " Even a tender-looking new shoot is as tough as rope . Horowiec has tried a power mower and a string trimmer , but they get tangled up instantly . He went at the roots with an ax . It made no difference . He managed to clear the alley using hand tools , but the kudzu just got thicker than ever . " It always comes right back , " he says grimly .
