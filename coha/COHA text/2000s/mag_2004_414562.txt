It 's midnight and I 'm exhausted . For 200 hours , I 've been caught in a mind-numbing loop : unplug , tweak code , compile , load , plug in , pause for sigh and brief prayer . Once again , I crouch on the floor and wave a pink ball in front of my half-built friend , whom I 've named " Pinky the Robot Who Follows a Pink Ball . " He does n't , and I 'm crushed , but I ca n't stop because I 'm very close . So close that Pinky 's starting to creep me out a little . Anyone who can solder can build a robot from a kit , but take away the plans and the parts you need and the know-how and now you 're living  --  scrounging the toolbox for brackets and switches , browsing that deserted section of RadioShack , dragging your battered brain through a thousand tiny victories . You 're a dreamer ! A scientist ! Even ( what the hell ) a genius ! At least that 's the journey I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CMUcam on Carnegie Mellon 's toy robots initiative site ( www-2.cs.cmu.edu/cmucam ) . There I saw clips of robots following brightly colored objects and knew I had to build one . The folks at CMU pointed me to acroname.com , where I bought the camera , a few servos and wheels , and a microcontroller called the BrainStem . The CMUcam lacked written instructions , so I spent the first couple of hours looking at a picture and soldering capacitors into the wrong holes . Then I fed the BrainStem some simple C code and modified the servos to give them 360 degrees of motion . So far , so good : I had eyes , legs and a brain . The next step was to make Pinky prefer pink . I knew the theory : The BrainStem asks the CMUcam what it sees , and then directs the servos to move the robot until the pink object is in the center of the cam 's frame . Apparently , this all happens over serial ports  --  but in what language ? How does a serial port work ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frantic Googling . Finally , I stumbled across a similar project on the Acroname site , an orange-obsessed robot complete with posted code I could steal and modify for my own pink-loving purposes . Easy ... except that it did n't work at all . I 'm ashamed to tell you how long I tweaked and tested that code until , many skipped meals later , I discovered the single troublesome line : some snippet about the camera 's auto-gain and white balance values . Driven by frustration and hunger , I decided auto-gain and white balance were stupid and just deleted the line . I hooked everything together , stuffed the guts into the BrainStem 's cardboard box ( note to self : find new body before BattleBots appearance ) and put Pinky on the ground to meet his destiny . Pinky , however , seemed more interested in thrashing around nonsensically , then scooting off under the couch . The motor-control functions I wrote had given him the equivalent of an inner-ear infection and a debilitating limp . After several more hours of trial and error , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training sessions , Pinky spun adroitly out of view of the ball I was holding and stopped dead in front of a chair , head upturned . I thought the battery had died until I noticed that he was staring wistfully at my wife 's pink tote bag , twitching back and forth to get the best possible view . Eureka . Pride welled up inside me and spilled out in a single tear . A little more code massaging had Pinky juking and weaving like a ball boy at Wimbledon . For $1,800 I could have bought a Sony Aibo that does the same thing ( OK , it does lots of other things too ) , but the trick itself has little staying power . I build robots for that moment when the chaos crystallizes into entirely expected yet somehow surprising behavior . Pinky 's not shiny and cute , nor does he have a tail to wag , but he represents many hours of my sweating and swearing , and for that , I love him .
