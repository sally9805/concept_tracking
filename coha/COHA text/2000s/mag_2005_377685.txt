CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES , now H.R.H. THE DUCHESS OF CORNWALL , finally married PRINCE CHARLES on a crisp Saturday in Windsor . The wedding had seemed positively jinxed . The royal chapel was n't licensed for civil weddings , so they had to switch to a public hall ; the Queen did n't attend the actual ceremony ; the Pope 's funeral postponed it all by a day . But in the end the crowd cheered warmly , and Camilla 's dress got thumbs up . Did a coach and horses then whisk the couple away ? No , a car did ; their royal relatives actually clambered onto buses for the Queen 's reception . Who says the monarchy ca n't modernize ?
