THEN THE WOMEN CAME BACK from the rest area , slinging their purses along and giggling , Dennis guessed that someone had flirted with them . He hoped they 'd keep their mouths shut about it . He was almost certain that Sandy would n't say a word , but you never knew about Christy . <p> Well , we got flirted with , Christy said . She linked an arm through his and leaned against him , standing on his feet , looking up at him . The sun was moving through her auburn hair , and there were already tiny beads of perspiration below her eyes , on the brown , poreless skin of her forehead . She smelled like juicy Fruit chewing gum . <p> Dennis unlaced his arm from hers and stepped back and wiped his wire-rimmed glasses on the tail of his shirt . He was wearing jeans and a denim shirt with the sleeves scissored out at the shoulders . He glanced at Wesley . He put the glasses back on and turned and looked at the river . Moving light flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the boats in the water , he said . <p> Wesley had both of Sandy 's hands in both of his own . Her hands were small and brown and clasped , so in Wesley 's huge fists they looked amputated at the wrists . Who flirted with you ? Wesley asked . <p> Sandy just grinned and shook her head . She had short dark hair , far shorter than Wesley 's . Wesley was looking down into her sharp , attentive face . The best thing about her face was her eyes , which were large and bluegreen and darkly fringed with thick lashes . The best thing about her eyes was the way they focused on you when you were talking to her , as if she was listening intently and retaining every word . Dennis had always suspected that she did this because she was deaf . Perhaps she did n't even know she did it . <p> Sandy had once been beaten terribly , but studying her closely Dennis could see no sign of this now . Perhaps the slightest suggestion of aberration about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even aware of . But her skin was clear and brown , the complex and delicate latticework of bones intact beneath it . <p> Nobody was flirting with us , she said , smiling up at Wesley . If they did you flashed them a little something , Wesley said . <p> If I could n't get flirted with without flashing them a little something I 'd just stay at the house , Christy said . She was giggling again . The big one said his name was Lester , she told Wesley . But do n't worry , he was ugly and baldheaded . <p> Lester ? What the hell kind of redneck name is Lester ? Was he chewing Red Man ? Did he have on overalls ? <p> You know , Wesley 's not the most sophisticated name I ever heard , Christy said . Nobody 's named Wesley , nobody . Do you know one movie star named Wesley ? <p> It occurred to Dennis that Christy might be doing a little flirting herself , although Wesley had been married to Sandy for almost two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , someday sooner or later . <p> I do n't know any movie stars named anything at all , Wesley said . I 'll make him think goddamn Lester . I 'll Lester him . <p> Wesley wore cutoff jeans and lowcut running shoes with the laces removed . He was bare to the waist and burnt redblack from the sun so he looked like a sinister statuary you 'd chopped out of a block of mahogany with a doublebitted axe . He 'd been in the water , and his jeans were wet , and his hair lay in wet black ringlets . <p> Nobody was flirting with anybody , Sandy said carefully . She enunciated each word clearly , and Dennis figured this as well was because she had been deaf so long . Now she had an expensive hearing aid smaller than the nail of her little finger , and she could hear as well as anyone , but this had not always been so . <p> Are you all going to get the boats and stuff ? Christy asked . <p> Let 's get everything down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls up here . <p> Then let 's go , college man , Wesley said . <p> They followed a black path that wound through wild cane , brambles , blackberry briars . It led to a clearing where they 'd spent the night . On the riverbank were sleeping bags and a red plastic ice chest . Dennis began to roll up the sleeping bag he 'd slept in with Christy . Sometime far into the night he had awoken , some noise , a nightbird , an owl . Some wild cry that morphed into Sandy 's quickened breathing as Wesley made love to her . He wondered if Wesley still beat her . He looped a string around the sleeping bag and lashed it tight . When the breathing had reached some frenzied peak and then slowly subsided to normal , he had turned over , being careful not to wake Christy , and gone back to sleep . He turned now and tossed the sleeping bag into one of the two aluminum canoes tied to a hackberry depending out over the river . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis saw that a red four-wheel-drive Dodge truck had backed a boat trailer down the sloping bank to the shallows . On it were two aluminum canoes that might have been clones of the ones Dennis and Wesley were rowing . Two men were in the bed of the pickup , two men on the ground . The man unbooming the boats did indeed have on overalls . He was enormous , thicker and heavier than Wesley . He wore the overalls with no shirt , and his head was shaved . The top of his head was starkly white against the sunburned skin of his face , as if he 'd just this minute finished shaving it . <p> Son of a bitch , Wesley said . <p> This is by God crazy , Dennis said , but Wesley had already drifted the canoe parallel with the shore and was wading out . Do n't let this canoe drift into the current , he said over his shoulder . He went up the bank looking at Sandy and Christy . Sandy 's face was as blank as a slate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christy 's told him what he wanted to know . He turned to the men grouped about the red truck . <p> Lester , I heard you were trying to hit on my wife , he said . <p> The bald man was turned away , but they were so close Wesley could smell the sweat on him , see the glycerinous drops seeping out of the dark skin of his back . The man had a malignant-looking mole the size of a fingertip between his shoulders , where the galluses crossed . The man fitted a key into a lock clasped through two links of chain securing the canoes . The lock popped open , and he freed the chain and locked the hasp through another link and pocketed the key . He turned . He looked up at the two men in the back of the truck and grinned . At last he glanced at Wesley . <p> This electronic age , he said , and laughed . I reckon it 's been all over the news already . He wiped the sweat off his head with a forearm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves on the bank above , and they were watching like spectators boxseated before some barbaric show . <p> Which one 'd be your wife ? Lester asked . <p> Faced with the prospect of describing his wife or pointing her out like a miscreant in a lineup , Wesley hesitated . Sandy raised her arm . That would be me , she said . <p> Did I hit on you ? Say anything out of the way ? No . You did n't . <p> The man looked Wesley in the eye . He shrugged . What can I say , he said . <p> Hey , loosen up , good buddy , one of the men in the truck called . He turned and opened an ice chest and began to remove cans of beer from it . He was bare to the waist , and he had straight , shoulderlength hair that swung with his movement when he turned from the cooler . He tossed a can to Dennis : Unprepared , he still caught it onehanded , shifted hands with it . One for the ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two . When he pitched a fourth to Wesley , Wesley caught it and pivoted and threw it as far as he could out over the river . It vanished without so much as a splash . <p> Lester looked up at the longhaired man and grinned . Not his brand , he said . <p> Do n't try to bullshit me , Wesley said . <p> I would n't even attempt it , friend , Lester said . He turned to the boat , his back to Wesley , as if he 'd simply frozen him out , as if Wesley did n't exist anymore . He unlooped the chain and slid the canoes off the sloped bed into the water . The two men leapt from the bed of the truck and with the third began to load the boats with ice chests , oars , boxes of fishing tackle . They climbed into the canoes and headed them downstream into the current . Lester turned to the women . He doffed an imaginary hat . Ladies , he said . <p> Wesley seemed to be looking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis said . <p> I could have handled them , Wesley said . All that fine help I had from you . <p> Dennis turned and spat into the river . Hellfire . You did n't need any help . You made as big a fool of yourself alone as you could have with me helping . <p> I ai n't letting them shitkickers run over me , Wesley said . Hell . I got a good Christian raising and a eighth-grade education . I do n't have to put up with this shit from anybody . <p> But Wesley 's moods were mercurial , and he seemed to find what he had just said amusing . He repeated it to himself , then looked toward the girls . Let 's get organized , he said . As soon as Jeeter Lester and his family get gone we 'll start looking for that Civil War cave . <p> He waded out to the canoe containing the red cooler . But first let 's all have a little shot of that jet fuel , he said . <p> Dennis was watching Sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was gone . No more than the sudden shadow of a passing cloud . Wesley had removed the lid from the cooler . He had somewhere come by an enormous quantity of tiny bottles of Hiram Walker . They were the kind of bottles served on airlines , and Wesley called them jet fuel . He was fumbling under sandwiches , dumping things out . Jet fuel , jet fuel , he was saying . <p> I 'm sorry , Wesley , Sandy called . I left that bag setting on the kitchen table . <p> Wesley straightened . Well it 'll do a whole hell of a lot of good setting on a table fifty miles from where I am , he said . He sailed the lid out over the river like an enormous rectangular Frisbee . <p> I said I was sorry . I really am . <p> Regret is not jet fuel , Wesley said . He hurled the cooler into the water . Everything went : cellophaned sandwiches , a sixpack of Coke , apples bobbing in the rapid current . A bottle of vin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came wading out of the river . Sandy and Christy were buckling on life jackets . Dennis glanced sharply at Wesley 's face . He stood up and put his folded glasses into the pocket of the denim shirt . <p> I do n't think you 're supposed to be throwing crap in the river like that , Christy said . <p> Oh no , Wesley said . The river police will get me . <p> Dennis was staring out at the lighthammered water . Lester and his cohorts had drifted out of sight around the bend . Now where is this famous Civil War cave ? he asked . <p> Supposed to be somewheres close , Wesley told him , relaxing visibly . He turned to the women . Can you all handle a canoe ? <p> I can row as good as you can , Christy told him . Maybe better . You all check out one side of the river and me and this fine defender of southern womanhood 'll look on the other . Check out every bluff , look for anything that might be a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you find a cave , sing out as loud as you can and we 'll be there . OK ? OK . <p> And keep those life jackets on . If you have to take a leak or just whatever , do it with the jackets on . <p> I 'm not sure I can do that , Christy said . She turned and gave Dennis a look so absolutely blank it could have meant anything . It could have meant , You showed common sense staying out of that argument he had . Or it could have meant , Why the hell were n't you backing him up ? <p> Wesley was looking out across the river . Goddamn it 's hot , he said . Did anybody see where that beer hit ? <p> They drifted with the current , and Dennis shipped the oars , only using one occasionally to steer clear of trees leaning into the water . Huge monoliths of black slate and pale limestone towered above them , ledges adorned with dwarf cedars twisted and windformed . The river moved under them , yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous serpent . <p> Snipes , Wesley said suddenly . <p> Dennis thought he meant some kind of bird . He was scanning the willows and cane ; he had a mental picture of some kind of longlegged bird , one foot raised out of the water , a fish in its mouth . <p> Where ? he asked . <p> Wesley by God Snipes , Wesley said . Ai n't he a movie star ? Yes , he is . <p> I 'll have to tell Christy about that when we catch up . They 're done out of sight around that shoal yonder . <p> After awhile Wesley told him again the story of the Civil War cave . The guy always called it that , the Civil War cave , as if the entire Civil War had been fought inside it . He said it was where Confederate soldiers hid out one time . You ca n't even see it from the ridge ; you have to find it from the river . He said there was all kinds of shit in there . Artifacts . Old guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckles . He did n't even care , can you feature that ? Said the guns was all seized up with rust . In the lifetime he had known Wesley , Dennis had heard this story perhaps a hundred times . He had his mind kicked out of gear , coasting along , listening to the river mumbling to itself . He thought of the look on Sandy 's face when Wesley had turned from hurling the cooler into the river , and he thought about gauges . <p> Once , long ago , on one of the few occasions when he had been blind , falling-down drunk , it had occurred to Dennis that life would be much simpler if everything had a gauge on it , the sort that on an automobile measure the temperature of the engine and so on . If the brain had a gauge you would know immediately how smart a certain decision was . You could start to act on it , keeping an eye on the needle all the time . You could proceed , pull back , try another approach . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were with somebody . And if you could read their gauge ... you could live your life with one eye on the needles and never make a foolish move . <p> Dennis had made several foolish movements in his life , but he had never wavered in the conviction that Wesley had a gauge in his head . It measured how close he was to violence , and went from zero into uncharted deep red , and every moment of Wesley 's life the needle hovered , trembling , on the hairline of white that was all that stood between order and chaos . <p> Dennis had long ago quit going to bars with Wesley . At a certain point in his drinking , as if a thermostat had clicked on somewhere , Wesley would swivel his stool and survey the room with a smile of goodnatured benevolence , studying its contents as if to ascertain were there inanimate objects worth breaking , folks worth putting in the hospital . <p> Six months after he married Sandy , he had eased into the bedroom of an apartment in the housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man named Bobby Joe Seales . He had slammed Seales full in the face with his fist , then turned his attention to Sandy . He had broken her arm and nose and jaw and shifted back to Seales . The room was a scene of carnage , folks said , blood on the floor , blood on the walls , blood on the ceiling . He had ripped the shade from a lamp and used the lamp base as a club , beating Seales viciously . Folks came screaming , cops . Dennis did not hear this story from Wesley , or from Sandy , but he had heard it plenty of other places , and Wesley stood trial for aggravated assault . The son of a bitch aggravated me , Wesley had said . So I assaulted him . <p> Seales had been on the Critical List . Folks always spoke of it in capital letters as if it were a place . A place you did n't want to go . Do n't fuck with Wesley beavers , folks said . He put Bobby Joe Seales on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogs in there . <p> Did you hear something ? <p> Dennis listened . All he could hear was the river , crows spilling raucous cries from above them , doves mourning from some deep hollow he could n't see . <p> Something . Sounded like yelling . <p> Then he could hear voices , faint at first , sourceless , as if they were coming from thin air , or out of the depths of the yellow water . Then he heard , faint and faint : Dennis . Dennis . <p> They 've found it , Wesley said . He took up his oars and turned the boat into the swift current . Let 's move it , he said . The voices had grown louder . If this is the right cave we 'll map it , Wesley said . Make us up some charts so we can find it again . <p> The river widened where it shoaled , then began narrowing into a bottleneck as the bend came up . Dennis could feel the river quickening under him , the canoe gaining urgency as it rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish she 'd shut the hell up , Dennis said . <p> All right , all right , Wesley yelled . We 're coming . That must be one hellacious cave . <p> But the cliffs had been tending away for some time now on this side of the river , and when they rounded the bend they saw that the bluffs had subsided to a steep , stony embankment where Christy and Sandy were huddled . Dennis could n't see their canoe . They were on their knees and still wearing life jackets , their hair plastered tightly to their skulls . Sandy was crying , and Christy was talking to her and had an arm about her shoulders . <p> Now what the fuck is this news , Wesley said , and Dennis felt a cold shudder of unease . He remembered something Dorothy Parker had purportedly said once when her doorbell rang : What fresh hell is this ? <p> They tipped us over , Christy said . Now she began to cry as well . Goddamn them . They were waiting for us here and grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tried to get us into the boats with them and when we would n't go they got rough , tried to drag us . I hit one with an oar , and that baldheaded fucker tipped us over . They took the boat . <p> Wesley seemed actually to pale . Dennis could see a cold pallor beneath the deep tan . It seemed to pulse in his face . Sandy , are you all right ? Wesley asked . <p> She ca n't hear , Christy said . When we went under it did something to her hearing aid , ruined it . Shorted it out or something . She ca n't hear a thing , I mean not a goddamned thing . <p> Oh , Wesley cried . He seemed on the threshold of a seizure , some sort of rageinduced attack . Eight hundred fucking dollars , he said . Eight hundred dollars up a wild hog 's ass and gone . I 'm going to kill them . I 'm going to absolutely fucking kill them . <p> Wesley made twelve dollars an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hundred and arriving at the number of hours he had worked to pay for the hearing aid . <p> Where 's the other oars ? <p> I do n't know . They floated off . <p> I 'm gone . I 'm going to kill them graveyard dead . He turned the boat about to face the current . Hey , Christy called . Wait . <p> Stay right here , Wesley said . And I mean right here . Do not move from that rock till we get back with the boat . <p> Let them keep the goddamned boat , Christy screamed , but Wesley did n't reply . He heeled into the current and began to row . He did not speak for a long time . He rowed like a madman , like some sort of rowing machine kicked up on high . I 'll row when you get tired , Dennis said . Fuck that , Wesley told him . After awhile he looked back and grinned . How dead am I going to kill them ? he asked . <p> Graveyard dead , Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a time he said , There will be some slow riding and sad singing . <p> Trees went by on the twin shorelines like a landscape unspooling endlessly from one reel to another . A flock of birds went down the metallic sky like a handful of hurled slate . Dennis guessed by now the Lester gang was long gone , into the tall timber , their canoes hidden in the brush , laughing and drinking beer , on their way back across the ridges to pick up their truck . <p> What were you going to do back there , kick my ass ? Dennis was looking at the sliding yellow water . What ? <p> Back there at the camp when my jet fuel was missing . You got up and folded your little glasses and shoved them in your pocket . You looked for all the world like a schoolteacher getting ready to straighten some folks out . You think you can kick my ass ? <p> I would n't want to hurt you , Dennis said . <p> Wesley laughed . How long have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third grade . <p> Third grade . Have I ever lied to you ? <p> I do n't know . How would I know that ? Not that I know of . <p> I never lied to you . So I 'm telling the truth now . I 'm going to kill them . I 'm going to kill them with an oar , not flat like I was paddling their ass , but sideways like I was chopping wood . I 'll take their heads off . Do you want out ? I 'll ease over and let you out . <p> The boat had n't slackened . The oars dipped and pulled , dipped and pulled , with no variation in their rhythm . The boat seemed to have attained its own volition , its own momentum . <p> No , Dennis finally said , and he knew with a cold horror that Wesley was telling the truth . <p> Do you really think I 'd stop long enough to let you out ? You never lie . <p> No . <p> I can ask you the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But before he could ask it , Wesley suddenly shouted . A hoarse cry of exultation . Dennis looked . They were aligned on a sandbar far downriver , three of them , the three canoes beached on the shore like bright metallic whales . Tiny dark figures in attitudes of waiting , watching them come . <p> Shouts came skipping across the water . Now he could see that Lester had his hands cupped about his mouth like a megaphone . It took you long enough , he yelled . <p> Wesley might not have heard . He was leaning into the oars , the muscles in the arms that worked them knotting and relaxing , knotting and relaxing . <p> They stood like the last ragged phalanx of an army backed to the last wall there was . They each held an oar . When the boat was still twenty feet from the shoreline Wesley bailed out . Oar aloft like God 's swift sword . He seemed to be skimming the surface , a dark , vengeful divinity the waters would not even have . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and swung . The oar made an eerie , abrupt whistling . Blood misted the air like paint from an exploding spray-can . Lester went to his knees clutching his face , blood streaming between his fingers . Wesley hit him across the top of his head , and a vulval gash opened in the shaven flesh . Dennis slammed the longhaired man backward , and he stumbled and fell into a thicket of willows and wild cane . He advanced on him , swinging the oar like a man killing snakes . An oar caught him across the bicep , and his left arm went suddenly numb . He turned . A man with a fright wig of wild red hair and clenched yellow teeth broadsided him in the shoulder with the flat of an oar just as Wesley broke his own oar across the man 's back . Wesley was left with a section half the length of a baseball bat . The redhaired man was going to run through the cane , and Wesley threw the stub of the paddle at him . <p> The longhaired man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane , and he 'd just disappeared . Dennis was almost giddy with relief . It seemed over before it had properly begun , and it had not been as bad as he had feared it would be . <p> Lester was crawling on his hands and knees away from the river . He crawled blindly , his eyes full of blood , which dripped into the sand below him . <p> Wesley picked up a discarded oar and walked between Lester and the growth of willows . He had the oar cocked like a chopping ax . Lester crawled on . When his head bumped Wesley 's knee he reared backward , sitting on his folded legs . He made a mute , armsspread gesture of supplication . <p> Wesley , Dennis yelled . Kill this motherfucker graveyard dead , Wesley said . <p> Dennis crossed the sand in two long strides and swung onto Wesley 's arm and wrested the oar from him . Wesley sat down hard in the sand . He got up shaking his head as if he 'd clear it . He crossed the sandbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water and washed his face . Lester crawled on . Like something wounded that just wo n't die . When he was into the willows he struggled up and stood leaning with both hands cupping his knees . Then he straightened and began wiping the blood out of his eyes . Dennis lay on his back in the sand for a long time and stared into the sky , studying the shifting patterns the clouds made . Both arms ached , and he was slowly clasping and unclasping his left hand . The bowl of the sky spun slowly clockwise , like paleblue water emptying down an endless drain . <p> He could hear Lester lumbering off through the brush . Wesley came up and dropped onto the sand beside Dennis . Dennis had an arm flung across his eyes . He thought he might just lie here in the hot weight of the sun forever . His ribs hurt , and he could feel his muscles beginning to stiffen . <p> I wish I had n't quit smoking and I had a cigarette , Wesley said . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hot , heavy work , and it does wear a man out so . <p> Dennis did n't reply , and after a time Wesley said , You ought to 've let me kill him . I knew you were n't as committed as I was . I could see your heart was n't in it . You did n't have your mind right . <p> He was dragging off like a snake with its back broke , Dennis said . What the hell do you want ? Let it be . <p> We need to get these boats back to where Sandy and Christy are . Damned if I do n't dread rowing upstream . Bad as I feel . You reckon we could rig up a towline and pull them along the bank ? <p> I do n't know . <p> You do n't think they 'd go back to where the girls are , do you ? I do n't know . <p> We better go see . No telling what kind of depravities those inbred mutants could think of to do with an innocent young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat up . He could hear a truck engine . It was in the distance , but approaching , and the engine sounded wound out , as if it were being rawhided over and through the brush . He stood up . The truck seemed to be coming through the timber , and he realized that a road , probably an unused and grown  --  over logging road , ran parallel with the river . They know this river , he thought . The fourth man went to get the truck . Through a break in the trees chrome mirrored back the light , the sun hammered off bright red metal . The truck stopped . The engine died . Immediately Dennis could hear voices , by turns angry and placating . They seemed to be fighting amongst themselves , trying to talk Lester either into or out of doing something . A door slammed ; another or the same door slammed again . When he looked around , Wesley had risen and gathered up two of the paddles . He reached one of them to Dennis . Dennis waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodge , he said . <p> We got to get the boats . <p> To hell with the boats . We got to move . <p> Something was coming through the brake of wild cane , not walking or even running as a man might , but lurching and stumbling and crashing , some beast enraged past reason , past pain . Wesley turned toward the noise and waited with the oar at a loose port arms across his chest . <p> Lester came out of the cane with a .357 Magnum clasped both  --  handed before him . It looked enormous even in his huge hands . Lester looked like something that had escaped halfbutchered from a meatpacker 's clutches , like some bloody experiment gone awry . His wild eyes were just black holes charred in the bloody suet of his face . The bullet splintered the oar and slammed into Wesley 's chest . Wesley 's head , his feet , seemed to jerk forward . Then Lester shot him in the head , and Wesley sprung backward as if a springloaded tether had jerked him away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full out . He glanced back . The pistol swung around . He dove sideways into the cane , rolling , and running from the ground up as the explosion showered him with sand , the cane tilting and swaying in his bobbing vision . The horizon jerked with his footfalls . Another shot , shouts , curses , men running down from the truck . He 'd lost his glasses , and trees swam into his blurred vision as though surfacing at breakneck speed from murky water . Branches clawed at him ; a lowhanging vine hurled him forward like a projectile blown out of the wall of greenery . He slowed and went on . He could hear excited voices , but nobody seemed to be pursuing him . He went on anyway , his lungs hot as if he moved through a medium of smoke , of pure fire . The timber deepened , and he went on into it . He fell and lay across the roots of an enormous beech . The earth was loamy and black and smelled like corrupting flesh . He vomited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . After awhile the truck cranked and retreated the way it had come , fast , winding out . He raised his face and spat . There was a taste in his mouth like a cankered penny , and he could smell fear on himself like an animal 's rank musk that you ca n't wash off . <p> When he finally made it back to the sandbar , the first thing he did was hunt his glasses . They were lying in the cane where he 'd dived and rolled , an earpiece bent at a crazy angle but nothing broken . He put them on , and everything jerked into focus , as if a vibratory world had abruptly halted its motion . <p> Wesley was on his back with the back of his head and both hands lying in the water . He looked as if he 'd flung his arms up in surrender , way too late . Dennis looked away . He took off the denim shirt and spread it across Wesley 's face . <p> He dragged one of the canoes parallel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wesley was a big man , and this was no easy task . He was loath to touch the bare flesh , but finally there was no way round it and he picked up the legs and worked them across the canoe and braced his feet and tugged the torso over into it . The boat lurched in the shallow water . By this time he was crying , making animal sounds he did not recognize as coming from himself . He threw in two oars and , running behind the boat , shoved it into deeper water . When he climbed in , he had to sit with a foot on either side of Wesley 's thighs in order to row . In the west the sinking sun was burning through the trees with a bluegold light . <p> Twilight was falling when he came upon them , a quarter mile or so downriver from where they 'd been left . They were straggling along the bank , Christy carrying what he guessed was a stick for cottonmouths . He oared the boat around broadside and rowed to shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prow into the bank , turned toward the women . They were looking not at him but at what was in the boat . All this time he 'd been wondering what he could say to Sandy , but he remembered with dizzy relief that she was deaf and he would n't have to say anything at all . There did n't seem to be any questions anyway , or any answers worth giving if there were . <p> Christy 's face was a twisted gargoyle 's mask . Oh no , she said . Oh , Jesus , please no . <p> Dennis sat on the bank with his feet in the water . Rowing upstream had been hard , and he had his bloody palms upturned on his knees , studying the broken blisters . Sandy rose and climbed down the embankment , steadying her descent with a hand on Dennis 's shoulder . She stood staring down into the boat . She knelt in the shallow water . Dennis stood up and waded around the boat and steadied it . He looked curiously like a salesman standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hear Christy crying . She cried on and on . <p> Wesley lay with the bloody shirt still flung across his face . He lay like a fallen giant . Treetrunk legs , huge bronze torso . Sandy took up one of his hands and held it . The great fingers , thick black hair between the knuckles . She held the hand a time , and then she began folding the limp fingers into a fist , a finger at a time , tucking the thumb down and holding the hand in a fist with her own two hands . She sat and looked at it . Dennis suddenly wondered if she was seeing the fist come at her out of a bloody and abrupt awakening , rising and falling as remorselessly as a knacker 's hammer , and he leaned and disengaged her hand . The loose fist slapped against the hull and lay palm upward . <p> He thought she might be crying , but when he looked up her eyes were dry and calm . They locked with his . Nor would she look away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move so she could read them . <p> We 've got to get him out of here , Christy sobbed . A road somewhere maybe ; somebody would stop . <p> Nobody answered her . Dennis was n't listening , and Sandy could n't hear at all . He wondered what it would sound like to be deaf . What you 'd hear . From the look on Sandy 's face across the body of her fallen warrior he judged it must be a calm and restful sound , the sighing of a perpetual wind through clashing rushes , a lapping of peaceful water that never varies or ceases . <p>
