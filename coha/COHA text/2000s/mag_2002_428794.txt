The first meeting of Shrinks ' Kids Anonymous // HI . MY NAME IS PAM . AND I 'M THE OEDIPAL DAUGHTER OF A ( SLIGHTLY NARCISSISTIC , YET HIGHLY CONSCIOUS AND DEEPLY EMPATHIC ) OPPOSITE-GENDERED PARENT WHO IS A SHRINK . " HI . PAM . " I APPRECIATE THE LARGE TURNOUT . I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE SO MANY OF US OUT THERE . WE , THE ADULT CHILDREN OF THIS NATION 'S MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS . ARE A SILENT POPULATION ALTOGETHER IGNORED BY THE STUDIES . LITERATURE AND SCHOLARSHIP IN OUR PARENTS ' FIELD . This is probably a good thing . I mean , dinnertime at my house always felt like a psychological survey . ( " How did you feel about Debbie telling you she was going to kick your butt ? " " Let 's explore how you contributed to her anger . " " Let 's think a little bit about the power you 're giving her . " I so wished that just once my dad would throw on his coat and bark , " Nobody messes with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her butt right into next week ! " ) Mercifully , I no longer harbor such rescue fantasies . Really . I do n't need to cling to the mythological safety of my family of origin . I am no longer " Elecktrafied , " as I dubbed my fatherfixation when I was nine . Yes , I knew all about the Elecktra complex when I was nine . At that age I wanted to be a child psychologist when I grew up and share a practice with my father , " Just like Freud and Anna Freud , " I 'd say . I have transitioned . In fact , a week ago I dreamed that my husband , not my father , was driving our old wood-paneled family-of-origin station wagon from my childhood . Despite such progress , I do look forward to delving into these and many other destructive psychological constructs with you . Photograph // I 'll officially kick off our first meeting by saying I maybe should n't use the word " shrink " so blithely . A little passive-aggressive , right ? I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the charm of passive aggression ? You get to say it , but you 're not responsible . ) Although my dad does have the capacity to make a person feel small , sometimes , he can be a little shrink-wrapped-but not so much anymore . In fact , I 'm at peace with how adult I am when I 'm around him nowadays . But I suppose , technically , the shrink part was referring to my father 's profession , not my feeling infantilized by him , was n't it ? Pardon my projection . That 's what my husband says when I 'm vein-popping-screaming at him about why he 's making a federal case out of something . " Get the popcorn , " he says with bone-deep calm , " the projectionist is here . It 's showtime . " ( This is what happens when the deeply centered son of a marriage and family psychologist marries the sky-is-falling daughter of a Freudian-trained analyst . ) Like my husband is the model of mental health . Mr. Zen . Mr. Let 's Not Overreact . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasize our fights being videotaped by some disembodied , impartial being I could conjure up at the right moment , at which point I could say , " You think you did n't sound enraged ? That was just you offering a thoughtful alternative interpretation ? Really ? Roll tape . ' And the judge would announce my vindication . Anyway , my husband contends that his mother 's profession is not a defining piece of psychological information , nor is it a pertinent psychological tool with which to dissect him . No , it 's biology or brain synapses , deep parental love , loving childhood memories , family trips , economic status , education , tweaks of nature-those are what make him tick . Hello ? Earth to Planet Denial . Takes one to marry one . I know for a fact . ( I always know things for a fact , which is a significantly higher degree of truth than simply knowing or believing something . I think I always say " I know for a fact " because when you 're a shrink 's kid , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling very angry right now , " or , " I know you 're thinking this is unfair , " and , " I know your tummy hurts because you 're so sad . " So you grow up desperately asserting the feelings , beliefs and thoughts you actually have , to ward off all those lovingly suffocating and infantilizing and minimizing interpretations-which may or may not have been on the money-but still made you feel like you could n't breathe and that you never had any authentic feelings in the privacy of your own mind . ) Where was I ? Unlike my husband , I know for a fact that my father 's profession has had a huge impact on my life and that I can point to all kinds of positive and pathological personality traits that derive directly from his work . I may paddle my Cleopatra way down DeNial on some things , but I 've certainly developed a hypervigilant level of consciousness about this one . Keep in mind : My dad is not your average Joe-Schmoe shrink . He is , by training and inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a shrink . I have come to understand that my father 's chosen profession is a power bigger than I am-I have to give in to it before I can move on . My husband , on the other hand , remains grounded on a sandbank in the Sea of Delusion . He says he 's the same person he 'd be if his mother had been a dental hygienist . He allows that maybe he 's a bit more perceptive , more sensitive , compassionate , more psychologically sophisticated than some sons of dental hygienists might be . But otherwise , that 's it . He was deeply loved and well cared for . A childhood full of fun . That 's what matters . I 'd like to give you some examples and let you judge , but my therapist says I should keep it on myself , describe what I 'm feeling . Like in court , when you say something about what somebody told you about what somebody else said , the opposing counsel jumps up and shouts : " Objection . Hearsay . Inadmissable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's a perfect example of how my father being a shrink has completely messed me up . You 'll recall I just said , " My therapist says ... " Do you know what it took for me to admit to you people that I 'm in ( stage whisper ) they-a-py ? I feel psychosomatically sick to my stomach right now . When I was three , I called it " sykoceramically . " I 'd tell my mom my tummy hurt , then point to my head . An insightful question you might gently want to raise now is : " Why the hell does a three-year-old know what a psychosomatic illness is ? " ( I remember being sent to the principal 's office in the third grade for calling a classmate " psychotic . " When the principal asked what had I meant exactly , I dutifully explained , " A neurotic builds castles in the sky . A psychotic moves in . " ) Photograph // My dad had a home office , and I know this makes it easier on shrinks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sneak behind the curtains and watch the patients drive up . " The Crazies , " I 'd call them . I 'd cup my ear to the door when he 'd get those 2 a.m. crisis calls . Then he 'd talk into a tape recorder . I could hardly hear , but some of the things he said his patients were doing to themselves still make me shiver . My dad assured me they were good people who were sick and needed help . I 'd stare hard through the window and look for visible deformities . No eyes . No legs . Spots . But they all looked completely normal . And there were so many of them , streaming in and out all day long . There began my lifelong attachment to the idea that most people are total nut jobs . And you better watch out , because you ca n't tell by looking at them . You all seem bright enough to fastforward through my life and see how that notion might make a girl a less-than-charming date . Enter my husband . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me with his inability to let it rip , at bottom , he is an extraordinary partner . And I believe being a shrink 's kid is a big part of it . At the toughest moments in our marriage , after I 've dumped all my huge feelings out there , when I 've made damn sure nobody gets to tell me what they are or tamp them down , I 'll have a moment of clarity and offer some narration about having several levels of feelings , several selves with differing opinions , about various forms of acting out , or about leaving my body and losing the key so I ca n't get back in . I 'll show some glimmer of awareness . And he 'll get it . He 'll read the subtitles . He is well trained and fluent in this language . I 'll see that I 'm being heard , that I 'm safe , and that pulls me back in . These moments are gifts from my father and his mother . I thought I came here to admit I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like a lot of kids of shrinks , I grew up with a deep psychic split : the intense desire to be a patient so I could get my dad 's attention , and an even more intense repulsion , fear , anxiety around the idea of being one of those crazies . I remain too neurotically ashamed and embarrassed to say anything else about my therapeutic experience , other than this : Every week I choose , anew and again , to go . I may not go next week . I may quit forever . But I went today .
