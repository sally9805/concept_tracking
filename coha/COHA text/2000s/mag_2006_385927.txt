Casting a Wider Net I live in a rural area that is not serviced by cable and my local phone company does n't offer DSL . I looked into satellite Internet service years ago and was disappointed to learn that it was slow , awkward and expensive . Are there any reasonably priced , easy-to-use satellite ISPs ? The earliest satellite broadband services were launched in the 1990s and were generally sold alongside satellite TV service . The main drawback in those days was that the broadband worked in only one direction . These " telco return " systems delivered high-speed downloads through the satellite stream , but uploaded information was sent over a slow-as-molasses phone line . This patchwork technology proved awkward and left satellite broadband with a bad rep . Now , when you are at the Internet sites of satellite TV providers DirectTV and Dish Network and look for Internet service , you are guided to partner companies , such as Verizon and Qwest , that sell DSL . But several companies , such as Wild-Blue , StarBand and HughesNet , sell satellite broadband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . The services are still expensive compared to cable and DSL-expect to pay $50 to $80 per month , depending on the bandwidth you choose . There are also equipment fees-you 'll need a dish and a modem-that can be at least $500 or more , depending on the lease agreement , although many installers are happy to roll those fees into a one- or two-year contract . ( Portable dishes that can be mounted on RVs cost even more . ) Nevertheless , it 's a far more affordable option than it used to be . That 's good , because according to a WildBlue estimate , over 15 million people in the United States do not have access to fixed-line broadband . If you decide to go with two-way satellite service , keep in mind the limitations . While download speeds are decent ( more than 12 times faster than dial-up , on average , for basic packages ) , it 's still slower than most DSL or cable services . Plus , the latency-the amount of time it takes for your request for information to be answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . That 's because it takes some time for the signal to be shot into space , shot back down to your ISP , then back up to the satellite and down to your PC with a response . The latency makes two-way satellite Internet unsuitable for playing real-time video or online games that require instant reaction times . For nearly everything else-downloading files , e-mail and browsing the Web-satellite Internet is an acceptable connectivity choice . Squeeze Play Do I need to keep old compressed files after I 've unpacked them ? I 've got tons of them stored in my downloads folder but I 'm afraid to throw them away . If you have the hard disk space , I 'd say keep them . I tend to take all my temporary Internet files , downloaded applications and other detritus of Internet life , and toss them-unorganized-into dated archive folders every month or so . Why ? Well , it 's nice to keep a local copy if possible in case you need access to , say , a video you 've downloaded when you are n't able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downloaded it as a zipped or self-extracting file , it 's definitely a good idea to keep the original download file after installing it and burn it to a backup disk if you can . You never know when something 's going to go haywire with your software and you 'll want to start fresh and reinstall . There are also times when you might prefer an older version of software to the newer one , but the older version is no longer available online . For example , my favorite firewall application was recently purchased by another company ; the once free version now has pop-up screens that nag me to buy the more expensive software . I preferred the previous , nagfree version , so I reinstalled it from my old compressed file . And , do n't forget to keep the support software for your hardware . If something goes wrong with any of your installed devices , it 's good to have all the device drivers backed up to a compressed archive on a CD or DVD , because there 's never any guarantee that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Seeing Double After consolidating the music collection from my work computer onto my home computer , I now have over 50GB of music , much of which consists of duplicate songs . Is there any easy way to weed out the dupes ? I wish I could tell you otherwise , but the answer is no . It 's going to be a pain to get rid of the duplicate files , as evidenced by the dozens of software applications out there designed to fix this very problem . This software can make the process easier , but not by much . To understand why , pretend you 're a computer faced with two identical-looking music files . It 's easy to tell the files are the same-you 're a computer , and matching things is one of your better tricks-but it 's hard for you to tell which file should be deleted . Should it be the older one ? The newer one ? The one sitting in a folder with other , similarly named files making up an album ? Is one file a live version while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applications-Duplicate Finder from Ashisoft.com , as well as iTunes ' built-in duplicate finder-will help you find the doubled files , but you ( and I mean the real you now , not computer you ) will still have to make the decision about which file to keep . ( Many duplicate finder tools will let you select an " automatic delete " option , but I would n't recommend it ; learn from my mistakes . ) While you 're busy organizingyour unwieldy collection , you 're likely to find that many of your music files lack proper file names or IDS tags . If you 'd like a quick and easy fix , take a look at MusicBrainz ( music brainz.org ) . The database uses digital audio fingerprinting to compare your sound files with those of thousands of other users , allowing you to name files without listening to each one . Like weeding out duplicates , it takes some hand-holding , but it 's still a timesaver .

A messy desktop or intrusive software could be slowing you down . Here 's how to clean house and pick up the pace . - Anthony Verducci EASY 1 Clean up the Clutter The simplest way to speed your startup time is to keep your system clean . Windows loads the files and icons on your desktop and in your recycle bin into memory every time it boots-so delete anything you do n't use regularly from your desktop and empty your trash . Another potential slowdown could be hidden viruses and spyware . Root out these menaces with free removal tools such as AVG Free Edition from Grisoft or Ad-Aware from Lavasoft . Finally , an organized drive is a faster drive . Right click the icon for your boot drive and run Windows ' defragmentation utility . MODERATE 2 Simplify Your Startup Still not fast enough ? Try holding down the Shift key during boot . That will tell your computer to ignore all the programs that are scheduled to automatically load at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process becomes significantly faster , then you may want to use Windows ' search tool to find your " Start folders , " and do a little culling . Next , check your Scheduled Tasks folder ( Start/All **27;5590;TOOLONG Tools ) for anything that might be programmed to run at startup . If you do n't feel you need to run it every time , you probably do n't . DIFFICULT 3 Streamline Your System Unless you are an expert user , we generally advise that you leave your system settings alone . However , there are a host of background , system-lev I programs that may be wasting valuable time at startup . If you 're feeling brave , you can disable them . Using the System Configuration Utility ( Start/Run/type " msconfig " ) , select the General tab and choose Selective Startup . Go through the list of programs and cautiously deselect anything you clearly do n't need running in the background . If your tinkering causes problems on reboot , go back to the System Configuration Utility and change Selective Startup to Normal Startup. // <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
