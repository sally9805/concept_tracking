Offer From a Gentleman , An Chapter One This year 's most sought-after invitation must surely be that of the Bridgerton masquerade ball to be held Monday next . Indeed , one can not take two steps without being forced to listen to some society mama speculating on who will attend , and perhaps more importantly , who will wear what . Neither of the aforementioned topics , however , are nearly as interesting as that of the two unmarried Bridgerton brothers , Benedict and Colin . ( Before anyone points out that there is a third unmarried Bridgerton brother , let This Author assure you that she is fully aware of the existence of Gregory Bridgerton . He is , however , fourteen years of age , and therefore not pertinent to this particular column , which concerns , as This Author 's columns often do , thatmost sacred of sports : husband-hunting . ) Although the Misters Bridgerton are just that  --  merely Misters  --  they are stiIl considered two of the prime catches of the season . It is a well-known fact that both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect sight to know that they also possess , as do aIl eight of the Bridgerton offspring , the Bridgerton good looks . Will some fortunate young lady use the mystery of a masquerade night to snare one of the eligible bachelors ? This Author is n't even going to attempt to speculate . Lady Whistledown 's Society Papers , 31 MAY 1815 Sophie ! Sophieeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! " As screeches went , it was enough to shatter glass . Or at least an eardrum . " Coming , Rosamund ! I 'm coming ! " Sophie hitched up the hem of her coarse woolen skirts and hurried up the stairs , slipping on the fourth step and only just barely managing to grab the bannister before landing on her bottom . She should have remembered that the stairs would be slick ; she 'd helped the downstairs maid wax them just that morning . Skidding to a halt in the doorway to Rosamund 's bedroom and still catching her breath , Sophie said , " Yes ? " " My tea is cold . What Sophie wanted to say was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , you lazy fiend . " What she did say was , " I 'll get you another pot . " Rosamund sniffed . " See that you do . " Sophie stretched her lips into what the nearly blind might call a smile and picked up the tea service . " Shall I leave the biscuits ? ' she asked . Rosamund gave her pretty head a shake . " I want fresh ones . " Shoulders slightly stooped from the weight of the overloaded tea service , Sophie exited the room , careful not to start grumbling until she 'd safely reached the hall . Rosamund was forever ordering tea , then not bothering to drink it until an hour passed . By then , of course , it was cold , so she had to order a fresh pot . Which meant Sophie was forever running up and down the stairs , up and down , up and down . Sometimes it seemed that was all she did with her life . Up and down , up and down . And of course the mending , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darning , the bedmaking ... Sophie ! " Sophie turned around to see Posy heading toward her . " Sophie , I 've been meaning to ask you , do you think this color is becoming on me ? " Sophie assessed Posy 's mermaid costume . The cut was n't quite right for Posy , who had never lost all of her baby fat , but the color did indeed bring out the best in her complexion . " It is a lovely shade of green , " Sophie replied quite honestly . " It makes your cheeks very rosy . " " Oh , good . I 'm so glad you like it . You do have such a knack for picking out my clothing . " Posy smiled as she reached out and plucked a sugared biscuit from the tray . " Mother has been an absolute bear all week about the masquerade ball , and I know I shall never hear the end of it if I do not look my best . Or "  --  Posy 's face twisted into a grimace  --  " if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined that one of us snare one of the remaining Bridgerton brothers , you know . " " I know . " " And to make matters worse , that Whistledown 's woman has been writing about them again . It only "  --  Posy finished chewing and paused while she swallowed  --  " whets her appetite . " " Was the column very good this morning ? " Sophie asked , shifting the tray to rest on her hip . " I have n't had a chance to read it yet . " " Oh , the usual stuff , " Posy said with a wave of her hand . " Really , it can be quite humdrum , you know . " Sophie tried to smile and failed . She 'd like nothing more than to live a day of Posy 's humdrum life . Well , perhaps she would n't want Araminta for a mother , but she would n't mind a life of parties , routs , and musicales . " Let 's see " Posy mused . " There was a review of Lady Worth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems rather smitten with some girl from Scotland , and then a longish piece on the upcoming Bridgerton masquerade . " Sophie sighed . She 'd been reading about the upcoming masquerade for weeks , and even though she was nothing but a lady 's maid ( and occasionally a housemaid as well , whenever Araminta decided she was n't working hard enough ) she could n't help but wish that she could attend the ball . " I for one will be thrilled if that Guelph viscount gets himself engaged , " Posy remarked , reaching for another biscuit . " It will mean one fewer bachelor for Mother to go on and on about as a potential husband . It 's not as if I have any hope of attracting his attention anyway . " She took a bite of the biscuit ; it crunched loudly in her mouth . " I do hope Lady Whistledown is right about him . "
