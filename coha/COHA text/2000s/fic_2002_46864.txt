" If a synchronous swimmer drowns , " quipped comedian George Carlin , " is the other one supposed to drown also ? " In his latest story , Harvey Jacobs does n't quite take this question seriously ... but Mr. Jacobs does n't appear to take many things seriously . His short stories ( of which this one is the fourteenth we 've published since 1967 ) tend to be witty , ironic , and often very very funny . Take the plunge with this one and see if you do n't need to come up for air between chuckles . <p> BASIL WILLING FIRST BECAME aware of Synchronous Swimming during an Olympic telecast . He watched a couple from Upper Volta , perfectly coordinated , perform an incredible series of twists , turns , soundings and breechings , he watched their extended legs and thighs wave like flags in the same wind , he saw arms and hands , even fingers , move in exquisite harmony , he saw their bodies lift like whales from the water 's gravity , their heads pop up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled this way , then that way while the skulls that held them snapped in opposite directions with the intensity of tango dancers . He was utterly captivated . No fool , Basil had a good idea of the reason he was so moved . His own life was in total disarray . He lost his job as a programmer for a dotcom startup when the venture capitalists suddenly withdrew their funding . His live-in lover , who he jokingly called his insignificant other , announced that she was leaving him in favor of a high-school boyfriend she 'd run into by accident during a trip to Saks Fifth Avenue where she 'd gone to buy Basil new underwear and socks before their annual sale ended . He thanked heaven they had no marriage contract or children to fight over but she took their dog , a large , shaggy beast , and his lawyer advised him against seeking custody because of costs and complications . In addition to his personal troubles , the world around him was heaving and pulsating like an overfilled bladder about to burst and scatter bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious germs circulating through the mail , the urgent threat of invisible terrorists who had already wounded what had seemed to be the invincible body of his city , hourly news reports of unspeakable horrors from countries with names as remote as the lands in forgotten dreams . Inside this swirl of chaos the self-contained calm of the synchronous swimmers made an astonishingly welcome statement , a testimonial to order , civilization , the virtue of discipline , sensual beauty as redemption , the possibility of survival , even triumph for the whole human race . Basil immediately appreciated what those swimmers had endured to get where they were : hours of practice , the physical pain of contortion beyond anything the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes ever imagined , visions of a gold medal shining like a distant sun drawing them toward its blazing core , their willingness to hone and refine their stunning presentation even as their chlorinated skins shriveled and flaked . All in the outside hope of standing on a raised center platform while their flag rose and their country 's anthem played hugely through state-of-the-art speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf , tennis , baseball , football , soccer , squash , and the like had never really captured his interest . He envied friends and associates who gave themselves to the individual pursuit of athletic excellence . He felt left out during passionate discussions of perfected serves or artful putts , experiencing the guilt of the uncommitted . Now , late in life , he was past forty , Basil discovered Synchronous Swimming in an epiphany worthy of any prophet . Suddenly , dimensionally , he understood the frenzy of fans , that private flame fueled by desire that flickers even in the belly of rank amateurs . If , even for a moment , an ordinary human could fuse with the immortals and taste fame 's leftovers , everything would be forever changed . He determined to swim synchronously at least to the best of his ability , to search out the elusive essence of synchronicity . Basil wasted no time . Enough precious days had already been squandered . He bought a top-of-the-line bathing costume identical to those worn by the Olympic contenders . He joined a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , magazines , and pamphlets that surveyed every aspect of Synchronous Swimming . He found relevant videos and watched them over and over , absorbing subtleties of the sport . When he was n't involved in sending out resumes or going on job interviews he was at the club lifting weights , running on the treadmill , leaping into the generous pool to test his wind and loosen muscles gone rigid from years of under-use . As he strengthened , he tested moves he 'd read about or saw on his tapes . He tried to do his swimming when the pool was deserted but sometimes , even at odd hours , others would come to do their pedestrian laps and he sensed them watching him with nervous eyes . Basil realized that serious Synchronous Swimming evoked not only suspicion but even hints of hostility from those outside the fold . He felt not unlike a Hasid who walks around the city in black hat and long silky coat or a Sikh flaunting a turban in the driver 's seat of a taxi . That feeling , a mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came clear that the hours he spent in the gym and the pool were not enough . Synchronous Swimming demanded much more than just horizontal indulgence . Training was a totality , it required both horizontal and vertical obeisance . Curiously , the one thing it did n't require was constant submersion . True , water was an important part of the picture , but not the whole story . To get good , really good , Basil accepted that every waking moment , dripping wet or bone dry , must be regarded as an opportunity to improve . He began swimming synchronously around the clock . When he woke in the morning he got out of bed and walked to the bathroom with a series of intricate flourishes . When he sat on the toilet , reached for the roll of paper , got up , washed his hands , brushed his teeth , wiped his face , combed his hair , dressed himself he practiced ever more complex choreography . When he went to the local luncheonette for coffee and eggs , while he browsed the newspaper , rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sat face-to-face with a potential boss he bent his body , swiveled his neck , spread and snapped his fingers , stretched his legs , curled his ankles , clenched his toes , extended his arms , exercised his eyes until his pupils could move like marbles left , right , up , down , together , apart . To keep himself company , Basil created an invisible partner , an anonymous female with no formulated features . She was more a creature of essence than specific attributes , something like a shadow . In the future he would , of necessity , seek out a flesh-and-blood teammate . At that point he would dispose of his ghostly companion . That , along with his respect for sanity , was reason enough not to get too involved with his temporary friend , but he did allow himself to work with her , talk with her , sometimes play with her , always respectful of their mutual privacy , always mindful of their wispy relationship . They chatted in the pool and on the street , confining themselves to subjects directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Basil 's VCR , dissecting movements of elbows , hips , nostrils , earlobes , breasts , crotches that made the difference between competence and glory . They agreed to disagree and were openly critical of one another 's abilities , committed to honest appraisal , focused on crossing new horizons . Basil encouraged his nameless partner to nurture ridiculous thoughts of " going for the gold . " Her enthusiasm got him off his ass and back into the green , grueling pool when he felt too exhausted to move . Whenever opportunity arose , Basil went out on job interviews . After a long and difficult confrontation with the Human Resources Manager of an established developer of digital games , a meeting Basil thought very promising , he got a call from the headhunter who 'd provided the lead . " Listen , Mr. Willing , about that possible placement , they were very pleased with your qualifications but I 'm sorry to tell you the bottom line was a no . They said you struck them as a hugely talented but afflicted man . " " Afflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to a series of severe spasms . They said you carried on some kind of dialogue with yourself about hydrodynamics and bubbles . That 's what they said . " " Could you call them back ? " Basil said , laughing . " There 's a-simple explanation . The thing is , I 'm deeply involved with Synchronous Swimming and I have this demanding invisible partner . What I was doing was debunking the feasibility of a certain torso inversion she 'd proposed for our routine . If I was into , say , golf , they 'd have probably been impressed . We would have ended up comparing war stories and arguing over handicaps . Synchronous Swimming is a developed taste . Those so-called spasms and the snide comments to my partner had nothing to do with the job . Explain that to them . " " Maybe something else will come along soon , " the headhunter said . Basil thought hard about the rejection . He censured himself for allowing what was , at best , a hobby to become an obsession . On future interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet about his exercises and to table any discussions with his partner . He knew that changing his behavior would n't be easy to manage . It would be as agonizing as it was to quit smoking cigarettes . But discrimination against the truly synchronized was a sad fact of corporate life . There was no lobby ready to defend his civil liberties . What if he failed to hide his chronic preoccupation from potential employers ? Basil needed work . His landlord was already hounding him about overdue rent , indifferent to explanations about rocketing dues at the health club . Even at the club he was in arrears for locker fees . Threats had been made . Basil saw the writing on the wall . It was time to quit his romance with Synchronous Swimming and the only way to quit was cold turkey . His eyes filled with tears . He shook off his despair . " I think we 'll cancel tomorrow 's practice , " he told his partner . " We can work on the groin contortions and knee dimpling another day . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could both use a break . " " You 're dumping me ? " his partner said . " I need to think things out , " Basil said . " You 're throwing in the towel ? " " They wo n't even give me a towel , not unless I come up with the cash . Look , this is nothing personal . Worse case scenario , you find another partner . Sic transit . " " Just like that , " his partner said . " I 'm afraid so , " Basil said . " No severance , no nothing ? " " You 're freelance . There was never any confusion about that . No severance . No pension . I created you for my convenience and for the moment you 've become inconvenient . That 's not to say conditions wo n't change . Meanwhile , you 're not being rejected . You 're being downsized . So long and good luck . " " Not so easy . There 's some question about who created who . " " No question whatsoever . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder than it already is . " " We 'd better go down to the pool . " " It 's past nine o'clock . The pool 's closed . I ca n't indulge you even if I wanted to which I do not . " " One last and final swim together , " his partner said . " You owe me that . Closure . " " I hate the word closure . There 's no such animal . " " There 's closure if you insist on it . Like God . You do realize I can make trouble for you . I could pop up during those high power interviews of yours . Or slide between you and whoever when you 're having sex . " " I hate the expression having sex as much as I hate the word closure , " Basil said . " And I 'm beginning to dislike you . I 'm amazed at your attitude . If things were turned around , if it was you handing me my walking papers , I hope I 'd behave with more dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last swim ? " Basil considered his options . It was true that his invisible partner could complicate his life like some angry , unpredictable haunt . It was more prudent to send her away contented . He had been abrupt with her , too heavyhanded . She deserved some gesture of appreciation . " One last swim then . " The Buff Fitness Center , tucked into a comer of a huge shopping mall , was dark and locked tight . Basil squeezed through the narrow alley that separated the complex from an International House of Pancakes . It led to the pool area defended by a high mesh fence . A nasty breeze roiled chilly air . He could hear water slosh against tile . With the heating system turned off and the wind blowing , the tiles would feel like ice and the water would startle his muscles . Synchronous Swimming was not for the cramped . " Maybe this should wait for tomorrow , " he said . " I have an ominous feeling . They might have security cameras . Some watchman might hear you splashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to me . When 's the last time you heard me splash ? The first thing you taught me was to slither like an eel , that splashing costs points . " " The hell with it , " Basil said , frustrated by her mewling . " Let 's get it over with . " He began climbing the fence using his fingers and toes for grips . She climbed beside him . " Nicely done , " his partner said when they dropped down at poolside . " I used to climb into the school playground , " Basil said . " This was nothing compared to that . " " There 's so much I do n't know about you , " his partner said . " We 've been together so long and we 're strangers . It makes you wonder . " " Wonder on your own time . Let 's get wet . " " Do n't you wonder about me ? You pulled me out of the void . I did n't know so much as the dead man 's float when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a long way together . " " You were a blank canvas . That 's how I wanted it , " Basil said . " One thing I can say , you always had spirit . Moxie . And you are a quick study . For somebody who never even heard of Synchronous Swimming you rose to the bait . " " I have a confession to make . " " Good . Go to church . Now get in the water . Instead of working through the usual routine , let 's improvise . I 'll follow your moves for twelve beats , then you follow mine . Be spontaneous . We 've nobody to please but ourselves . " " I did know a thing or two before we met , " his partner said softly . It was n't her usual rat-tat-tat voice . " I knew a lot . Basil , do n't hate me . Do n't sulk or attack . Hear me out . Back home I 'm considered rather proficient at Synchronous Swimming . In fact , I have five gold Spirals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a sense of humor , " Basil said . " Ha ha . Ho ho . Five golds , three silvers and a bronze - what was it , Spirals - back home ? You came from inside my head . If you won any medals you won them between my ears . Maybe I did allow myself to imagine a few grandiose victories but do n't make the mistake of confusing my hubris with your reality . Please , slither into the pool and out of my life . " " You must know we monitor this planet . You must realize we consider your species armed and dangerous . There 've been enough books and bad movies about that . " " We monitor your planet ? " Basil said . " What we ? " " We . Us . Them . You know . From out there . I was a Senior Celestial Observer before I became a professional athlete . I introduced my people to Synchronous Swimming after seeing it on your television . At first we considered the sport as comic relief . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone got into it . Finally it was accepted by the Committee on Intergalactic Commonality as a Valid Clash . It became an official event in the Rotational Games . " " You 're telling me you 're an award-winning alien who watched Earthlings swim synchronously ? That 's what they paid you for ? " " Exactly . And lucky for you . That 's how I convinced them to accept the test . " " What test , if you do n't mind telling me ? " " The more things get out of hand down here , the more your technology advances beyond your capacity to cope , the more public opinion swings toward termination . They want to eliminate Planet Earth not so much as a potential menace but as an embarrassment . " " Do tell ? " Basil said . " Fancy that . I amaze myself . How did I allow you to become such a developed fantasy ? I need help . Therapy the minute I can afford it . Talk about embarrassments to the universe . " " At the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke out in favor of restraint . I told them that if there was any possibility of even a single Earthling learning to swim synchronously , demonstrate any possibility of Cosmic Integration , it would be wrong to junk a perfectly nice planet . They respect me , Basil . I told you , nine Spirals and still so young . So they agreed to send me here to find a partner for next year 's Rotational Game . I knew it was a risk . It could cost me a sixth gold . Still , I accepted the challenge . That 's the kind of woman I am . " " And you picked me ? " " Not exactly . A computer picked you . It could have been anyone . Did n't it strike you as peculiar , your sudden avid interest in Synchronous Swimming ? " " Not really , " Basil said . " There 's a strain of insanity in my family . Besides , I was sweetly saddened by the attempt of two humans to paddle harmoniously , doomed to failure , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention gender-related discrepancies . Then there was the factor of amazing grace . " " You think you thought that up by yourself ? I put those ideas into your pedestrian brain . Look , Basil , you can walk away right now . Or you can take the plunge , give Earth one more chance . You 'll probably destroy yourselves anyhow but if you send me back alone there 's no probably because we 'll do it definitely . It could get ugly . Sometimes they leave renegade rock-rendering to the kids . They say it builds character . " " Tell me about those Rotational Games . " " What can I say ? They 're magnificent . Maybe a tad vulgar by purist standards but thousands of fans from the Sixteen Solar Quadrants pack the stadium . Everybody else watches from home . Glitz and glory . The winners win big , they get the Spirals and perks , losers get nice parting gifts . So , are you in or out ? " " How do you rate our chances ? " " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's advantage . And a certain freakish charm . The crowd might be with us . Except for the fundamentalists and some of the military . The rest depends on how far I can take you in the next few months . You do have a way to go . " " Which way is that ? I have n't the slightest conception of what you look like , of how we 'd look in tandem . " " I suppose you deserve a look at the merchandise . I hope you 're not overwhelmed by beauty . That could be a negative . " " I think I can survive your dazzle , " Basil said . " I was n't being cute , " his partner said . " Without boasting , I am very gorgeous . It 's an accident of nature and nothing I take credit for . The opposite . My motivation to cop those Spirals came from a kind of backlash . I always got everything I wanted because of my kick-ass looks , not for anything I said or did . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always suspected you were well fashioned , " Basil said . " Not that I thought too much about it . Your only function was to be my lead pony . Besides , I 'm a spiritual kind of person . " " Spiritual ? I 've seen you dribbling over Victoria 's Secret catalogs . You go into a kind of comatose catatonia . The females in that catalogue are stuffed eggplants compared with me and I do n't need you wasting seminal energy falling in lust or love . I like a little awe and wonder , it goes with the territory , but nothing excessive . " " Madam , I still think you 're a figment of my imagination . As such , I feel entirely capable of resisting whatever lubricious meringue you toss at me . Your move . " Basil was blinded by a flash of pure white light and deafened by what sounded like the crackle of a ton of cellophane wrap . When his eyes focused and his ears cleared , he looked around and saw nothing , which was what he expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could go home now and return to a recognizably mundane existence , just another guy trying to keep a modicum of balance on his whirling planet 's crust . " Good-bye and good riddance , " he said . Then he felt a tap at his left calf . Basil turned around . Still nothing . He felt another tap and looked down . " Me , " his partner said . She was three feet tall , the color of a ripe mango . Five tentacles hung from what he took to be her chest . Nine arms protruded from her compact frame , each ending in a pincer hand . Her one leg , thick as a tree trunk , was a series of silver coils . Her face , which seemed to be smiling , was the prow of a blimp head that swiveled on a thin , yellow stalk . A thick blue tongue swung like a pendulum from a fanged cave of mouth . He counted seventeen tiny eyes , some blue , some black , some brown , some gray , some a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radish-red furry beret jauntily tilted over a large , twitching ear . " Holy shit , " Basil said . " Jesus H. Christ . " " I warned you , " she said . " Now that we 've gotten past mystery , I think we should gird up our loins and buckle down to work . " " Which loins do you gird up ? I 'm not being snide . I have an inquiring mind . " " You are being vulgar . Let 's concentrate on basics and leave the fancy stuff for later . Our water back home is a bit slimy , about the consistency of your mushroom and barley soup , so we might as well hold back on the frills until I get you to my world . But while we 're waiting for transport we could try a few slow laps . " " Excuse me , " Basil said , " but this is about Synchronous Swimming . Synchronous Swimming is about swimming synchronously . Two bodies moving as one buoyed up by a lovely liquid lift , two essences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tell me something I do n't know . " " The marriage of jigsaw pieces , the orgiastic moment of their snapping together tantalizingly delayed . " " No argument there , Basil . " " Which brings me to a bit of a creative crisis . You and I .. By the way , what 's your name ? I never gave you a name . " " Oid Flxy . My parents liked Biblical names . " " Oid , to become supremely compatible it could be argued that a couple should be fairly compatible to begin with . Do n't misunderstand . I have nothing against tentacles , multiple arms and eyes , a zeppelin cranium and so forth but frankly , I worry that it might be difficult to convince a panel of judges that we 're in synch . " " We do have a lot in common , " his partner said . " We are devoted to the sport . That 's a starting point . Give or take my own disappointment over your simplistic instrument , which I do n't hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That you ca n't hold it against me , " Basil said . " We might be terminally incompatible . " " You 've got to transcend those feelings of inferiority , Basil . That insecurity plagues your whole species . It might be the reason for all your bloody wars and occasional massacres . Set your sights higher . You 've got to . If we do n't make a respectable show of it , Earth is yesterday 's news . " " But how can we choreograph the illusion of symmetry if nothing fits ? " " You suck in your gut , I retract my tentacles . Give a little , take a little . Our judges are tough but open-minded . They might give us the benefit of the doubt . Then again , who can say ? They can be vicious . But there is an appeal in asymmetric synchronicity . " " A limited appeal . Synchronous Swimming might not be the fairest test for Earth 's endurance . Maybe croquet ? Wrestling ? Extreme Polo ? " " Too late . We swim together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worked out . We have an hour before we 're scheduled for transportation . Might as well make the most of it . " His partner jumped into the pool . Basil watched her do some somersaults . That this was the woman he 'd been swimming with for nearly a year was inconceivable . Invisible , she seemed the ideal match for him , tuned to his every flip and frisson . Now , with so much at stake , seeing was unbelieving . On the other hand , Basil thought , if his rhomboids were educated to respond to the declension of what seemed to be her nose , if his clavicle could learn to truncate to her dorsal carapace , who knows ? " It 's ironic , " Basil said . " Truth be told , I never wanted a partner . I was a victim of my own inner peer pressure . Synchronous Swimming gets a bum rap as it is and if you tell people , even tell yourself , that you 're in the sport as a loner , it sounds indulgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner said . " Which brings me to another question . What happened to your last partner ? If you two were busy winning Spirals , he must have been a tad shocked when you dumped him . " " I did n't dump him , I absorbed him . We have this capacity for spontaneous absorption . At least our females do . When things get really synchronous it just happens . Every profession has its hazards . We 've got to be very careful to integrate some fragment of clash into our repertoire , some burr of friction without compromising score . You would n't want to be absorbed in the middle of a performance . " " This absorption , I assume , is reversible ? " " It 's terminal . Probably painless , though . " " Painless is good , " Basil said . He wanted to ask her about the closing ceremony at the Rotational Games , to describe a Spiral , or , if they managed to pull it off , whether " The Star Spangled Banner " would be played while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to his imagination and belly flopped into the frosty water . She swam toward him , being as synchronous as could be expected .
