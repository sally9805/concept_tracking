Which is why you usually have to wait in line at the gym for a bench , but there 's always plenty of floor space for the taking . Call it a natural rite of passage . After all , does n't everybody agree that pressing a plate-loaded bar off your chest is far more manly-and effective-than pushing your body away from the floor ? " Think again , " says Alwyn Cosgrove , C.S.C.S. , owner of Results Fitness , in Santa Clarita , California . " The pushup and the bench press both work your chest , shoulders , and triceps , but the pushup also trains your abdominals , lower back , upper back , and glutes .

HOW TO DO IT A Place three to five medicine balls in a semicircle and assume the pushup position with both hands on the ball to the far left . Your chest should be over the ball and your feet should remain in place throughout the exercise . B Move your right hand to the ball at right and do a pushup . Bring your left hand to that ball . C Continue moving right and doing pushups until you reach the farthest ball . Then work your way back .

When it 's weak , you ca n't move as much weight in the bench press and military press . And since your rotator-cuff muscles must then pick up the slack to stabilize your shoulder joint , shoulder pain and injury often result . Avoid pain and boost your bench press with the " Swiss-ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your shoulder blades glide away from each other at the top of the movement . When performed on the floor , the pushup plus activates your serratus anterior 38 percent harder than a standard pushup does , report researchers at the University of Minnesota .

Reverse the move . 6 TOTAL-BODY MUSCLE Dumbbell pushup row * " When most men perform rowing movements , they pull more with their arms than with their middle and upper back , which defeats the purpose , " says Mejia . But in this pushup , your arms , abs , and shoulders are forced to work together to keep you steady while your back muscles draw the weight to your rib cage-so you ca n't cheat . The benefit ? You 'll simultaneously build your back and chest , which not only saves you time , but also helps prevent muscle imbalances of your upper body . HOW TO DO IT A Get into pushup position with your arms straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your abs and glutes as you perform a pushup .
