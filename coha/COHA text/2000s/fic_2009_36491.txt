Shelby was within ten miles of her Uncle Walt 's ranch when she had to pull over to the side of highway 36 , the busiest stretch between Virgin River and Fortuna , behind an old pickup truck that looked vaguely familiar . Although 36 was the highway that ran across the mountains from Red Bluff to Fortuna , it was mostly two lane . She put her cherry-red Jeep SUV in Park and stepped out of the vehicle . The rain had finally stopped , giving way to a bright summer sun , but the road was wet and splattered with muddy puddles . She peered way up the road to see a man wearing a bright orange vest holding a stop sign toward a long string of cars , closing both lanes . The turnoff to her Uncle Walt 's would be on the other side of the next hill . <p> She picked her way around puddles to the truck parked in front of her , intending to ask the driver if he knew what was going on . When she got to the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc . " <p> Doc Mullins looked out the open window . " Hey , yourself , little girl . Up here for a weekend of riding ? " he asked with his usual grumpy tone . <p> " Not this time , Doc . I sold my mother 's house in Bodega Bay , " she said . " Packed up the bare essentials and am moving in with Uncle Walt for a while . " <p> " Permanently ? " <p> " Nah . For a few months , though . I 'm still in transition . " <p> Doc 's grimace melted slightly , but only slightly . " Once again , condolences on your loss , Shelby , " he said . " I hope you 're doing all right with that . " <p> " Better all the time , thanks . My mom was ready to go . " She tilted her head up the road . " Have any idea what 's holding us up here ? " <p> " Soft shoulder gave out , " he said . " I passed it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill . They 're repairing . " <p> " Guardrails would be nice , " she observed . <p> " Only around the tight curves , " he said . " On a straightaway like this , we 're on our own . Damn lucky a car or truck did n't go with that soft shoulder . It 's going to be like this the next few days . " <p> " Once I get to Walt 's , I 'm not planning to be on this road again , for a while anyway , " she said with a shrug . <p> " What are you planning , if I might ask ? " Doc said , lifting one of his bushy eyebrows . <p> " Well , while I 'm visiting the family , I 'll be making applications to schools . Nursing , " she said with a smile . " A fairly obvious choice for me after taking care of my mother for years . " <p> " Ach , just what I need , " he said with his usual scowl . " Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at him . " At least we wo n't have to drive you far . " <p> " There 's just what I mean . Another impertinent one , at that , " he clarified . <p> She laughed again , loving this ornery old guy . Shelby turned , Doc leaned out of his window and both of them watched a man approach from the truck that had stopped behind Shelby 's Jeep . He walked toward them . His hair was shaved down in that military fashion she 'd been accustomed to all her life ; her uncle was a retired army general . A black T-shirt was stretched tight over broad , hard shoulders , his waist narrow , his hips slim and legs long . But what fascinated her was the way he came toward them , with an economy of movement . Deliberate . Confident . Cocky . His thumbs were hooked into front pockets and he sauntered . When he got closer , she could see his very slight smile as he looked at her , or looked her over , to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dreams , she thought , which caused her to smile back . <p> As he passed her Jeep , he glanced inside at all the packed-up boxes , then continued to where she was standing beside Doc 's open window . " That yours ? " he asked , jutting his chin toward the Jeep . <p> " Yup . " <p> " Where are you headed ? " he asked . <p> " Virgin River . You ? " <p> " The same . " He grinned . " Any idea what 's going on up there ? " <p> " Collapsed shoulder , " Doc said with a grunt . " They have us down to one lane for repairs . What 's your business in Virgin River ? " <p> " I have some old cabins along the river there . " He glanced between them . " You two live in the town ? " he asked . <p> " I have family there , " Shelby said . She stuck out her hand . " I 'm Shelby . " <p> He took her small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward Doc , putting out his hand again . " Sir ? " <p> Doc did n't extend a hand , but rather gave a nod . His hands were so twisted with arthritis , he never risked a handshake . " Mullins , " he said . <p> " Doc Mullins has lived in Virgin River all his life . He 's the town doctor , " Shelby explained to Luke . <p> " Nice to meet you , sir , " Luke said . <p> " Another jarhead ? " Doc asked , lifting one white , spiking eyebrow . <p> Luke straightened . " I beg your pardon , " he said . " Army . Sir . " Then he looked at Shelby . " Another marine ? " <p> " A few of our friends who work in town are marines . Retired or discharged . Their friends come around sometimes  --  some of them are still active or in the reserves , " she explained . " But my uncle , who I 'll be living with for a while , was Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out that much with your hairdo . I do n't know what it is with you guys and the buzz cuts . " <p> He smiled patiently . " We 've never been checked out on those dryer things . " <p> " Ah . Blow-dryers . Right . " <p> As they waited in their stalled lane , the second lane was opened up to let a big yellow school bus pass . Judging by the number of vehicles waiting in their lane , they were n't going anywhere anytime soon , so there was no great rush to get back to their cars . They remained standing on the road , which ended up being a big mistake for Luke . As he saw the bus barreling down the other lane , Luke also noted a sizable puddle in front of it . He quickly put himself between Shelby and the bus , pressing her up against Doc 's open window . With a hand on each side of her , he covered her with his body , barely in time to feel the splat from the puddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macho man , she thought with some humor . <p> Luke heard downshifting , then the squeal of brakes . " Jesus , " he muttered as he backed off the girl and glared after the bus . <p> As Luke turned and scowled at the bus , the driver leaned out the window . A round-faced woman in her fifties , rosy cheeked with a cap of short dark hair , grinned at him . She grinned ! " Sorry , buddy , " she said . " Could n't hardly help that . " <p> " You could if you went a lot slower , " he yelled back at her . <p> To his astonishment , she laughed . " Aw , I was n't going too fast . I got a schedule , y'know , " she yelled . " My advice ? Stay out of the way . " <p> His scalp felt hot under his short hair and he really wanted to swear . When he turned back to Shelby and Doc , he found her smiling behind her hand and Doc 's eyes twinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Luke , " she said , trying to keep control of her lips . <p> Doc 's face was the same  --  cranky and impatient , but for the glittering eyes . " Molly 's been slinging that big yellow tube around these mountains for thirty years now , and ai n't nobody knows these roads better . Guess she did n't see a pothole this once . " <p> " It 's not even September yet ! " Luke protested . <p> " She drives year-round , " Doc said . " Summer school , special programs , athletics . Always something going on . She 's a saint  --  you could n't pay me enough to do that job . What 's a mud puddle here and there ? " Then the old doctor put his truck noisily in gear . " Our turn coming up . " <p> Shelby jogged back toward her Jeep . Luke started to walk back toward his truck , which pulled a camper . Then he heard Doc , shouting at his back , " Welcome to Virgin River , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cackle. * * * <p> Shelby McIntyre had been fixing up her deceased mother 's house for months , but she 'd been able to drive up to Virgin River from Bodega Bay nearly every weekend through the summer to ride . And her Uncle Walt had paid many a visit to her to oversee renovation work that he 'd personally contracted . By the end of summer Shelby had roses on her cheeks . She had rolled up her shorts and her legs were tanned . Her thighs and butt had developed firm riding muscles and her eyes sparkled with health . It had been years since she 'd benefited from that type of regular exercise . <p> But when she pulled up in front of Walt 's house now , in mid-August , it was a completely different feeling . The house was sold , her belongings were in the back of her Jeep , and at the age of twenty-five , she was embarking on a brand-new life . She gave the horn a toot , got out of her Jeep and stretched . In just moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with his hands on his hips , a big grin on his face . " Welcome back , " he said . " Or should I say , welcome home ? " <p> " Hey there , " she said , walking into his arms . Walt was six feet with thick , silver hair , dark bushy brows and shoulders and arms like a wrestler 's . He was a powerfully built man for just over sixty . <p> He hugged her tight . " I was just about to go to the stable and saddle up . You too tired ? You hungry or anything ? " <p> " I 'm dying to get on a horse , but I think I 'll pass after riding in a Jeep for over four hours , " she said . <p> He laughed . " Backside pretty well broken in ? " <p> " Ohhh , " she said , rubbing her butt . <p> " I 'm just riding down along the river for an hour or so . Vanni 's down at the new construction , getting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in time to cook you a nice welcome-home dinner . " <p> Shelby looked at her watch . It was only three-thirty . " Tell you what  --  I 'm going to run into town while you go for your ride and Vanni inspects her new house . I 'll say hi to Mel Sheridan and see if I can talk her into a beer to celebrate my change of residence . I 'll be back in time to help with the horses before dinner . Should I get this stuff out of the Jeep first ? Take it inside ? " she asked . <p> " Honey , leave it be , no one 's gon na bother it . Paul and I will unload you before supper . " <p> She grinned at him . " Let 's make a date for tomorrow morning . We 'll have that ride together . " <p> " Good deal . No trouble closing on the house ? " <p> " It was a little more emotional than I expected . I thought I was ready . " <p> " Regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his face . " I cried for the first fifty miles , " she said . " And then I started to get excited . I 'm sure about this . " <p> " Good , " he said , giving her a squeeze . " I 'm so glad you 're here . " <p> " Just for a few months . Then I 'm going to travel a little and get a head start on school . It 's been so long since I 've been a student . " <p> " Life here is usually pretty laid-back . Take advantage of it . " <p> " Yeah  --  " she laughed "  --  when you 're not having shoot-outs or forest fires . " <p> " Well , hell , girl , we want to keep things interesting ! " He walked her to her Jeep . <p> " Wait for me to get back to muck the stalls and feed the horses . " <p> " Enjoy a little girlfriend time , " he said . " It 's something you have n't had enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseshit to muck while you 're here . " <p> " Thanks , Uncle Walt , " she said and laughed . " I wo n't be too long . " <p> He kissed her forehead . " I said , take your time . You took good care of my sister . You 've earned piles of it . " <p> " See you in a couple of hours , " Shelby said , heading for town . <p> Luke Riordan pulled into Virgin River , his Harley strapped into the back of his extended-cab truck , pulling his small camper . It had been seven years since he 'd seen this town and there had been a few changes . The church was now boarded up , but what he remembered as an old , abandoned cabin in the center of town was renovated , had cars and trucks parked around the front porch , and an Open sign in the window . It looked like some construction was under way behind the cabin ; it was framed for an add-on . Since he was considering a renovation project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at what had been done to this place . He parked off to the side , out of the way , and got out of the truck . He went into the camper and changed out of his muddy shirt before going inside . <p> The August afternoon was warm , with a cool , refreshing breeze ; the night would be chilly in the mountains . He had n't been out to the house he planned to live in , which had been vacant for a year . If it was uninhabitable , he had his camper . He took a deep breath . The air was so damn clean , it stung the lungs . Such a huge change from the deserts of Iraq and El Paso . Just what he 'd been needing . <p> He walked into the renovated cabin and found himself in a good-looking little country bar . He stood just inside the door and looked around appreciatively . The hardwood floors gleamed , hot embers glowed in the hearth , hunting and fishing trophies hung mounted on the walls . There were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there were shelves full of liquor and glasses surrounding a stuffed king salmon that must have weighed about forty pounds at the catch . A television , mounted high in a corner , was tuned to national news , the volume turned down . A couple of fishermen , identifiable by their khaki vests and hats , sat at one end of the bar playing cribbage . A few men in work shirts and jeans were having drinks at a nearby table . Luke looked at his watch : 4:00 p.m . He walked up to the bar . <p> " What can I get you ? " the bartender asked . <p> " A cold draft , thanks . This place was n't here the last time I was through town . " <p> " You 've been away a while then . I 've been open more than four years now . I bought it and turned it into this . " <p> " Well , you did a helluva job , " he said , accepting the beer . " I 'm going to be doing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Luke Riordan , " he said . <p> " Jack Sheridan . Pleasure . " <p> " I bought some old cabins along the Virgin that have been sitting empty and going downhill for years now . " <p> " Those old Chapman cabins ? " Jack asked . " The old man died just last year . " <p> " Yeah , I know , " Luke said . " I was back here hunting with one of my brothers and a couple of friends when we first saw them . My brother and I thought the location , right on the river , might be worth some money . We noticed the cabins were n't in use and wanted to buy ' em and fix ' em up for a quick resale , turn ' em fast and make a couple of bucks . But old Chapman would n't even listen to an offer . " <p> " It would have left him homeless , " Jack said , giving the bar a wipe with a cloth . " He would n't have had too many options , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
