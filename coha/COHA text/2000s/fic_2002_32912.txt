CLARE CRAIG January 1st A promise to myself : this year is a new beginning for me . A fresh start , in more ways than one . I 'm determined to put the divorce behind me.About time , too , since it 's been final for over a year . Okay , thirteenmonths and six days to be exact , not that I 'm counting ... well , maybe Iam , but that 's going to stop as of today . Michael has his new life and I have mine . I 've heard that living well isthe best revenge . Good , because that 's what I intend to do . I 'm going tolive my life as a successful , happy ( or at least , contented ) single womanand mother . This is my vow . I will no longer expect another person toprovide me with a sense of worth . I do n't need a husband to make mefeel complete . It 's been a struggle to let go of the marriage , but holdingon to all that pain and anger is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of fighting and sick to death of the resentment , the bitterness.I just never thought anything like this could possibly happen toMichael and me . I saw divorce mow down marriages all around us , but I somehowthought we were safe .... It did n't help any that I ran into Marilyn Cody over the Christmas holidays.She had n't heard about the divorce , and when I told her my husband had left me for a **25;979;TOOLONG , my ex-husband ( Istill have trouble remembering that ) I could see how shocked she was.Then , apparently thinking she was giving me good advice , Marilyn suggestedI find myself a boy toy ( or is it toy boy ? ) to get my confidenceback . She was actually serious , as though going to bed with a man onlya few years older than my own children would make me feel better . Marilynis a good example of why I ca n't remain friends with the peopleMichael and I once associated with . Losing Marilyn as a friend is no great loss , anyway . I read the pityinglook in her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've kept myhusband if I had n't let myself go . It was all I could do not to get in herface and defend myself as though that would prove anything . As a matter of fact , I happen to weigh within fifteen pounds of what I did attwenty-five , and damn it all , I take care of myself . If anyone 's sufferingfrom middle-age spread , it 's Michael . The audacity of Marilyn to implythat Michael 's affair is somehow my fault ! How the hell was I supposed to compete with a girl barely out of herteens ? I could n't . I did n't . Every time I think about the two of them together , I feel sick to my stomach . The journal-writing class has helped . So did meeting Liz , Julia andKaren . They 're my friends , and part of my new life . Forming a solid relationship with each of these women is one of the positive changes I 've made.As the saying goes , " Out with the old and in with the new . " I 'm glad thefour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though theclass is n't being offered again . Thursdays for breakfast was an inspired idea . Writing down my thoughts is the only way I got through the last sixmonths . This should be a good time in my life . Instead , I 've been forcedto start overnot my choice and not my fault ! Okay , fine . I can deal withit . I am dealing with it , each and every day . I hate it . I hate Michael , although I 'm trying not to . The best I can say at this point is that I 'm coping . I will admit one thing . Michael 's affair has taught me a lot about myself.I had n't realized I could truly hate anyone . Now I know how deep myanger can cut ... and I wish to hell I did n't . My mistakeand I made a fewwas in delaying the divorce as longas I did . Eternal optimist that I am , I clung to the belief that , given time , Michael would come to his senses . I was convinced that eventually he'dsee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An affair with a twenty-year-oldwas sheer madness . Surely he 'd wake up one morning and realizehe 'd destroyed his entire lifeand for what ? Good sex ? I doubt she'sthat incredible in the sack . In retrospect , I could kick myself for waiting so many months to see anattorney . I merely postponed the inevitable , because I was so sure he'dadmit what he was doing and put an end to it . How I prayed , how I longedfor the opportunity to save my marriage . If only Michael would comehome again . If only he 'd give us another chance . Little did I understand that his actions had utterly destroyed the foundation of our lives together.The minute he told me he 'd fallen in love with Miranda ( sure he had ! ) , Ishould 've hightailed it into a lawyer 's office and set the divorce in motion.Doing that would have saved me a lot of grief . At a particularly low point , when I was feeling absolutely desperate , I signed up for counseling . The irony did n't escape me , even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the one making appointmentswith a shrink ! Then , on a particular Thursday morning about a year and a half ago , I got up after another restless , miserable , lonely night . I remember leaning against the bathroom sink in such emotional pain I could n't evenstand upright . I looked at myself in the mirror and barely recognized myown face . Something happened in those moments . Nothing I can preciselyidentify , but the experience changed me . The victim disappeared andthere I stood , straight and tall , glaring back at my reflection , determined to survive . Michael might want to kill our marriage , but he would n't kill mein the process . In retrospect , I realize that was when I 'd reached my limit . I got dressed and marched myself right down to Lillian Case 's office.If there 's anything to smile about regarding this ugly divorce , it 's the miseryLillian put Michael through . Michael repeatedly claimed he wanteda friendly divorce , but as Lillian said , it was far too late for that . The boys still are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Alexwas always close to his father , and I know he misses Michael . We don'ttalk about him . I wish we could , but nothing I can say is going to takeaway the pain of having their father walk out the door . What Michaelfailed to understand was that in leaving me , he abandoned his children , too . He did n't just betray me . He broke faith with us all . I probably should have figured out what was happeningthat waswhat Marilyn seemed to insinuate . I did suspect something was wrong , but never , ever would I have guessed this . I thought maybe a midlife crisisor boredom with our marriage . Maybe that was how he felt ; maybeit 's why he did what he did . But he should 've been honest with me abouthis feelingsnot had an affair . Bad enough that my husband screwedanother woman , but a friend 's daughter ? I can only imagine what Carl would think if he were alive . It 's all socrazy . Just a few years ago , Michael and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation . Our top car salesmankeels over from a heart attack and Michael , being a caring friend andbusiness-owner , helps the grieving widow with the funeral arrangementsand the insurance paperwork . Even crazier is the fact that I actuallysuggested it . My one concern at the time was that Michael might be getting tooclose to the widow . Only it was n't Kathy keeping my husband entertainedall those nights . It was her twenty-year-old daughter . I do n't thinkKathy or I will ever get over the shock of it . Michael still does n't fully appreciate the consequences of what he'sdone . He sincerely believed that once we were divorced , everything wouldreturn to normal between him and his sons . Mick set him straight on thatscore . Alex , too . I know Michael has n't stopped trying , but the boys won'tbe so easily won over . I 've done my best to stay out of it . Nothing will everchange the fact that he 's their father ; how they choose to deal with him isup to them . I refuse to encourage either boy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a relationship with Michael , either . The choiceis theirs . Twenty-three years of marriage and I never looked at another man.Damn it all , I was a faithful , loving wife . I could have tolerated an affairif he 'd given it up and returned to our marriage . But , no , he Okay , enough . I do n't need to keep repeating the same gory details . AsI said , this is a fresh start , the first day of a new year . I 'm giving myself permission to move on , as my psycho-babbling counselor used to put it . Part of moving on is belonging to the breakfast groupand continuing to write in my journal . Liz suggested we each pick a word for the year . Aword . I have n't quite figured out why , let alone which word would best suitme . We 're all supposed to have our words chosen before we meet nextThursday morning at Mocha Moments . I 've toyed with the idea of beginnings , as in new beginnings , but Ido n't want to carry that theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , beginnings have to become middles and potentialhas to be realized . I guess I 'm afraid I wo n't be as successful asI want to be . What I really need to do is discover who I am , now that I 'm single again.For twenty-three years my identity was linked to Michael . We were a team , complementing each other 's strengths and weaknesses . I was alwaysbetter with finances and Michael was the people person . He took a part-timejob selling cars the first year we were married in order to supplementour budget , and quickly became the top salesman . His degree wasin ecology and he had a day job at the town planning office but madethree times the money selling cars . Soon he was working full-time at thedealership and I was stretching every dollar he made , creating a smallnest-egg . Then we had the chance to buy the Chevrolet dealershipthe opportunityof a lifetime . We scraped together every penny we could . By thetime the paperwork was finished , we did n't have a cent between us , butwe were happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to dwell on how happy we werein those early years . Whenever I think about it , I feel overwhelmed bythe pain of loss and regret . So much regret ... Word . I need a word . Not memories . I ca n't tie my new identity tothe past and to who I was ; I 've got to look toward the future . So I needa word that fits who I am today , the woman I 'm becoming . The womanI want to be . Just a minute here . Just a damn minute ! Who I was , who I want to be.Why do I have to change ? There 's nothing wrong with me ! I was n't the onewho ripped the heart out of this family . I was a good wife , a good mother.I was faithful ... FAITHFUL . That 's it . My word . Not beginnings , not discovery , but faithful . From themoment I spoke my vows I was faithful to my husband , my marriage , myfamily . All these years I 've been faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always put my family responsibilities above my own desires.I do n't need to find myself . I found out who I am a long time ago and franklyI happen to like that person . I was n't the one who changed ; Michael did . This feels good . The burden is n't on my shoulders to prove one damnthing . I 'll remain faithful to me . Happy New Year , Clare Craig . You 're going to have a wonderful year . Nofinancial worries , thanks to Lillian Case and a judge who 's seen far too manymen mess up their family 's lives . Michael will be spending twenty very longyears paying off my share of the dealership . Plus interest . I have the house , a new car every year , health insurance , the boys ' college expenses andenough money to live comfortably . I do n't have anything to worry about . I can do whatever I want . I certainlydo n't have to work if I do n't feel like it . Hey ! Maybe getting a job would n't be a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into play . Did n't I recently hear thatMurphy Motors was advertising for a general manager ? With my experience , I could work any hours I chose . News of my taking that job would reallyget Michael . It 's what he deserves . Turnabout is fair play ( another ofthose handy sayings ) . Oh God , it 's awful of me , but I love it . This is what I 've been waiting for . It 's taken a long time to feel anything but horrendous , crushing pain . I 'm smiling now , just thinking about the lookon Michael 's face when he learns I 've been hired by his largest competitor . Marilyn Cody was wrong , but then so was I. Living well is n't going to teachMichael a thing , is it ? Knowing that he 's lying awake at night , worrying aboutme sharing all his insider secrets with the Ford dealershipnow , that willgo a long way toward helping me find some satisfaction . And once I 'm satisfied , I 'll start to concentrate on living well . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clare Craig glanced up from her desk to find her seventeen-year-oldson standing in the doorway of the family room . They 'd spent themorning taking down the Christmas decorations , as they always didon January sixthEpiphany , Twelfth Nightand getting Mick readyto return to college . How like Michael he looked , she thought with atwinge of sorrow . Michael twenty-five years ago , athletic , handsome , fit . Her heart cramped at the memory . " I 'm not interrupting anything , am I ? " Alex stepped inside , dressedin his soccer uniform . The holiday break was already over ; school hadbegun earlier in the week . Mick had left that morning for college inSan Francisco . Clare capped the end of her fountain pen and set aside the checkbookand bills in order to give her younger son her full attention . " What can I do for you ? " Alex avoided her gaze . " We have n't been talking as much as weused to , " he mumbled , walking slowly toward her desk . " I 've been busy . " The Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't referring to the last few days ; hemeant over the past year . " I know , " he said with a shrug , his eyes darting around the room . " It 's just that ... " " Is there something you wanted to tell me ? " He raised his head and their eyes briefly met . Reading her youngerson had never been a problem for Clare . " How about if we talk in the kitchen ? " she suggested . " You thirsty ? " The hopeful look on his face convinced her to abandon paying thebills . She 'd get back to all that later . " Sure . " He led the way through the large family room and into thekitchen . Clare loved her expansive kitchen with its double ovens and largebutcher-block island . Shining copper pots and kettles dangled fromthe rack above , the California sunlight reflected in their shine . Clarehad designed the kitchen herself and spent countless hours reviewingevery detail , every drawer placement , every cupboard . She'dtaken pride in her home , in her skill as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to prepare a meal . Alex had apart-time job at a computer store , and if he was n't at school or work , he was with his friends or on the soccer field . Cooking for one personhardly seemed worth the effort , and more and more often she orderedout . Or did n't bother at all . " I 'll get us a Coke , " Alex said , already reaching for the refrigeratorhandle . Clare automatically took two glasses from the cupboard . Alex placed the cans on the round oak table . Many a night , unable to sleep , the two of them had sat here while Clare sobbed in pain andfrustration . Alex had wept , too . It had n't been easy for a teenage boyto expose his emotions like that . If Clare did n't already hate Michaelfor what he 'd done to her self-esteem , then she 'd hate him for the painhe 'd brought into their children 's lives . " Mick and I had a long talk last night . " Clare had surmised as much . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conversation . Their raised voiceswere followed by heated whispers . Whatever they were discussingwas between them and she was determined to keep out of it . Theyneeded to settle their own differences . " He 's upset with me . " " Mick is ? What for ? " Alex shrugged . He seemed to do that a lot these days . " Brother stuff ? " It was what he generally said when he did n't wantto give her a full explanation . " Something like that . " He waited a moment before pulling backthe tab on his soda can and taking a long swallow , ignoring the glassshe 'd set in front of him . " Does this have to do with Kellie ? " Alex and the girl across thestreet had been dating for a couple of months . Mick had dated herlast summer and Clare wondered if the neighbor girl was causing aproblem between her sons . " Ah , Mom , we 're just friends . " " If you and your brother had a falling-out , why do n't you just tellme instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Because I 'm afraid you 're going to react thesame way Mick did . " " Oh ? And how 's that ? " Alex took another drink of his Coke . Clare recognized a delayingtactic when she saw one . " Alex ? " " All right , " he said brusquely and sat up , his shoulders squared . " I 've been talking to Dad . " Clare swallowed hard , but a small shocked sound still managed toescape . She felt as though she 'd taken a punch to the solar plexus . " Are you mad ? " Alex asked , watching her anxiously . " It should n't matter what I think . " " But it does ! I do n't want you to feel like I 've betrayed you , too . " " I ... " " That 's what Mick said I was doing . First Dad and now me . Mom , I swear to you , it is n't like that . " " Michael is your father , " she said , her mind whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionallydo anything to hurt her . As much as possible , Clare had triednot to entangle her sons in this divorce . When Michael moved outof the family home and in with his under-age sweetheart , the twoboys had rallied around her as if they could protect her from furtherpain . It did n't work , but she 'd cherished them for their showof sympathy and support . " He called ... Dad did . " " When ? " Now she was the one avoiding eye contact . She distractedherself by opening the can of Coke and pouring it carefully into herglass . " Last week at Softline . " " He phoned you at work ? " She should n't have been surprised ; Michael was too much of a coward to risk having her answer thephone here at the house . Naturally he 'd taken the low road . " He invited me to dinner . " " And you 're going ? " Clare felt her son 's scrutiny . " I do n't know yet . Mick doesn'tthink I should . " " But you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area in front of the table . " That 's the crazypart , Mom . I do and I do n't . I have n't talked to Dad in over a yearwell , other than to say I was n't going to talk to him . " " He is your father , " Clare said , to remind herself as much as her son . " That 's what Kellie said . " Sure Kellie said that , Clare mused darkly . She had n't seen hermother betrayed and then dumped like last week 's garbage . Kellie hadtwo loving parents . She could n't even imagine what divorce did to aperson 's soul or how it tore a family apart . " I told Mick and I 'm telling you . If my seeing Dad hurts you , thenI wo n't do it . " Clare forced a smile but was n't sure what to say . " Kellie thinks I should be talking to Dad , " he said , studying herclosely , as though the neighbor girl 's opinion would influence her.Clare was n't particularly interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years had been for Alex , knew howbadly he missed Michael . " Kellie 's right , " she said briskly . " You and your father should becommunicating . " " You do n't mind ? " His obvious relief was painful to hear . She swallowed and said , " Alex , you 're my son , but you 're also your father 's . " " I ca n't forgive him for what he did . " " I know , " Clare whispered . She sipped her Coke in order to hide thetrembling in her voice , although she was fairly certain Alex had noticed . Her son glanced at his watch , did a startled double-take and boltedout of the chain . " I 'm late for soccer practice . " " Go on , " she said , waving toward the door . " Dad said he might start coming to my games , " Alex said , thewords rushed as he hurried to the back door . " Alex " " Sorry , Mom , got ta go . " Oh , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex at theirson 's soccer games . And what about his girlfriendwas she going , too ? If Alex chose to have a relationship with his father , that was one thing , but Clare could n't , would n't , be anywhere in Michael 's vicinity whenhe was with Miranda . The anger inside her remained deep and real , and Clare didn'ttrust herself to control it . But under no circumstances would she embarrassher teenage son , and if that meant not attending the games , then so be it . Almost immediately , the resentment sprang up , as strongas the day Michael had left her . He 'd already taken so much ! Howdared he steal the pleasure she derived from watching Alex play soccer ? How dared he ! For a long time she sat mulling over her conversation with Alex.She knew how relieved he was to have this out in the open . Alex hadbeen on edge for a while now , and she 'd attributed his tension to theupcoming SATs . But it was n't the tests that were bothering him , orhis relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasMichael . Clare was positive of that . Once again her ex-husband had gone behind her back . * * * January 15th I got the job ! There was never any doubt I 'd be hired . Dan Murphynearly leaped across the desk when he realized what he had . He gaveme everything I wanted , including the part-time hours I requested . He'llgo ahead and hire a full-time manager and I 'll be more of a consultant . Damn , it feels good . I 've never experienced this kind of spiteful satisfactionbeforeand I do recognize it for what it is . Until these last twoyears , I had no idea I could be so vindictive . I do n't like this part of me , but I ca n't seem to help myself .
