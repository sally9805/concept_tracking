Doing your best usually meant redoing . Abigail Franklin had learned that at her mother 's knee . <p> With a sigh , Abby squeezed her forceps , lifted the paste stone and dropped it in the center of her newest platinum setting for the third time . <p> " Looks good , " a voice offered . <p> " Good is never good enough , " she muttered . Then the familiar voice hit a nerve . <p> Abby 's fingers numbed . Her forceps slid out of her hand . She lifted her head and stared . <p> " Hello , Abby . " <p> He was back  --  after five long years . <p> Forcing taut muscles to obey , Abby slid from her stool and faced Donovan Woodward , the man who 'd promised her the world . And never delivered . <p> Memories of that smile , all sparkle , charm and appeal , swamped her . <p> " I 'm not an April Fool 's joke , so stop staring , " he ordered , his grin slashing his handsome face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She studied his jutting cheekbones . " And you ? " <p> " I 'm all right . " <p> He did n't look all right . He looked tired . <p> But the longer Abby stared at Donovan Woodward , the more she knew tiredness was n't the right word . True , there were deeply carved lines around his ocean-blue eyes , stripped now of the sparkle of pure fun that once dared her to join in . But tiredness was n't the reason . Donovan never got tired , not the life-of the-party Donovan that Abby had known . <p> Still , a girl did n't forget the face of the first man to ask her to marry him , even after five years . Yet his face had changed , matured . <p> " Are n't you going to say anything ? " he demanded when the silence stretched too long and the air bristled with tenseness . <p> His testy tone irked her . <p> " Such as what ? Welcome home ? " Abby suggested , glaring at him . " Or maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me five years ago . How did it go ? ' I made a mistake . I 'm leaving . Sorry . ' " <p> She gritted her teeth , irked she 'd let that slip out . <p> " That was n't my best moment , " he admitted . " But if you 'll listen a minute , I 'll explain  --  " <p> " After five years you 're finally offering an explanation ? " She tossed him a scathing glance before turning back to her work-table . " Forget it . " <p> " Abby . " Donovan touched her arm , wordlessly asking her to face him . " I know I should have explained my reasons to you personally . Asking you to marry me on prom night and leaving two days later for Europe was n't exactly what I 'd planned , but I figured you 'd understand I was doing it for you . " <p> " For me ? " Incredulity filled her . " Is that how you justify it ? " <p> " I did n't have to justify myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . " The gossip must have been awful . I 'm sorry I left you alone to face that , Abby . " <p> An apology from Donovan ? That was nice . But all he was apologizing for was the gossip . He 'd even intimated his leaving had somehow benefited her , which was ludicrous . But then , maybe five years in Europe had changed his memories . <p> Still , how could he say his decision had anything to do with her ? <p> " The past is over , Donovan . Let 's agree to disagree on your part in it . " She refocused away from the painful memories . " Will you be working at Weddings by Woodwards ? " <p> " Uh-huh . " His shaggy walnut-toned hair moved in a ripple of assent . <p> " Your grandmother will be ecstatic . That 's great . " She winced as her voice echoed around her work room like some kind of cheerleader . <p> " Oh , Abigail . The way you say that , " Donovan mocked . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled to talk to him when once they 'd never had enough time to say everything . <p> " Flew in tonight . Grandmother did n't tell me you 'd be here , " he mumbled with a frown at the array of tools she 'd spread out . <p> " Sorry . " If she 'd known he was coming she 'd have stayed away . <p> " Do n't be . I needed to apologize , Abby . I owed you that . " <p> " I do n't want your apology . " <p> " Tough . I needed to give it . " A smile flirted with his lips , but did n't quite reach his eyes . " Want to reciprocate ? " <p> " I have nothing to apologize for . " Something lurked beneath the surface of his remarks , something Abby did n't understand . " Anyway , I told you , I do n't want to discuss the past . We 're different people now . I 've moved on , Don . So have you , I 'm sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showering everyone in his life with laughter and happiness , always fun , totally irresistible . <p> And then he 'd left . <p> " I 'm sure you agree that leaving was the right thing to do , but I should have talked to you first . My only excuse is I was upset . " <p> The right thing to do ? <p> " Upset by what ? " Confusion filled her . " Proposing ? " <p> " No . " He studied her intently . " Have you forgotten everything about that night , Abby ? " <p> " I 've tried , " she said , meeting his stare . " It was n't the best time of my life . " <p> " Nor mine . " Something lay hidden in those words . Something Donovan evidently decided not to clarify because after a moment of further scrutiny , he shrugged , stepped closer and brushed the edge of her creation with one fingertip . " Is this a special order ? " <p> " A private commission . " She studied the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but better . " It 's an idea for a project , actually . " <p> Donovan nodded as if he 'd expected that answer . <p> " What 's the project ? " <p> Abby did n't want to share her dream with him . But this awkwardness between them had to end . Weddings by Woodwards was a tight-knit family company that offered everything a bride and groom could need . Winifred Woodward expected her employees to get along . <p> " Is it a secret ? " <p> " No . " Abby strove for a bland tone , ignoring her inner discomfort . " It 's for a contest in New York . Jewelry designers can submit fine designs . Well known designers will judge . It 's great exposure and a chance to get my designs into New York . Entries close in two weeks . " She bit her lip , then admitted the rest . " I have n't yet settled on the complete design . " <p> " As I remember , you always had plans to go to New York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dream . <p> " So what 's holding you back ? " Donovan leaned one hip against the counter and waited for her explanation . <p> " Time . My parents recently moved from their home into a retirement condo . It was a difficult transition . " <p> " Ah , your parents . " <p> Abby winced at his tone . Her mother had never accepted Donovan in her life . She 'd always claimed he was never serious enough about anything . He 'd endured her disapproval and caustic comments many times , and always without losing his charm . His faultless manners and quirky sense of humor had helped Abby weather many embarrassing confrontations . <p> " How are your parents ? I suppose the two dedicated doctors of genetics are still buried in their world ? " <p> " No . Dad 's in the first stages of Alzheimer 's . He gets frustrated by the memory lapses . Mom 's finding it difficult . " Was n't that an understatement ? <p> Her parents had always lived and breathed their work . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than pleased when she refused to attend college . Jewelry design was so not the career of choice her mother wanted for her only child , a fact she constantly reiterated . <p> " I 'm very sorry , Abby . " Donovan looked genuinely upset . " It ca n't be easy on you . " <p> " I manage . " <p> The casual hand he brushed through his hair , mussing it even further , was so Donovan . Abby blinked at the flicker of silver on his finger . He still wore the ring she 'd made for him in junior high ? That shocked her . <p> " So you entered this contest because  --  ? " <p> Again Abby shoved back past memories . <p> " Because it 's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to showcase my work to some of the top people in the industry . If I win , I 'll finally be able to move to New York and work with one of them . " <p> Donovan studied her solemnly . <p> " Still proving yourself , Abby ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallowed hard , suddenly furious . <p> " That 's not fair . Do n't I have a right to extend myself , see how far my abilities can take me ? You 're not the only one who has dreams beyond Denver you know . " <p> Donovan 's face altered . " I did n't mean that . You 're a talented designer who can work marvels with metal and stone . It 's only natural you want to stretch yourself . " <p> " I can hear a ' but ' in there . " <p> He searched her face . The sparkle that usually blazed through his eyes dimmed . <p> " I know how hard you must have fought to make your own way , Abby . " <p> " Nothing 's changed there , " she admitted grimly . " My mother still hopes I 'll have some kind of awakening and realize I really want to be a scientist . " <p> " Is she why you 've entered this contest ? " <p> The astuteness of his comment proved that Donovan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of sizing up a situation in seconds . But Abby did n't want him looking too closely into her motives . <p> " I 'm doing this for me , " she told him firmly . " Because I need to stretch myself , to do more unusual designs , ones Weddings by Woodwards has no market for . " <p> " And if winning means your mother finally accepts your capability , so much the better , right ? " He nodded as if he understood . " I suppose it 's the only way she 'll be convinced now . " <p> A simple uplift of one eyebrow breathed life into his entire face . Abby slammed the door on her memories . The past was dead . Her goal was the future . <p> " Have you got a stone chosen for this piece ? You 're surely not doing paste ? " <p> " The fellow who commissioned it is buying the diamond from Woodwards . " <p> " So you 're looking at what , three carats ? " he guessed . " Nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Donovan pulled a dark blue box from his jacket pocket . <p> " I saw this in Greece . It reminded me of that essay we did together in our senior year , the one on classical Greece . " <p> She did n't want to talk about their past . <p> Donovan snapped the latch exposing a gorgeous bracelet crafted in the Byzantine style . <p> Abby lost her breath when he slid the web of gold onto her wrist . No sooner had he closed the clasp than she brought the bracelet closer to study it . <p> " The detail of the granulation is incredible . It looks like it was spun into shape . " She twisted her arm left , then right , to examine each bend and fold , admiring the painstaking craftsmanship . <p> Then reality returned . <p> " I ca n't take this , Donovan . It 's too expensive . Besides , you do n't owe me anything . " She tried to slip it off , but he grasped her hand and held it between his . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would I ? " He lifted one eyebrow . " I bought it years ago because I knew you would appreciate it . " <p> And then what  --  he 'd forgotten he had it ? <p> Or he now wanted to be rid of all reminders of the past ? <p> " You ca n't return a gift , Abby . " <p> " But this  --  " <p> " Is yours . " He watched her tip her wrist toward the light , as if he understood how little she wanted to give back this bracelet . And he probably did . <p> Donovan had n't changed . He was still like a chameleon , spinning dreams and fantasy so well that everyone fell under his spell . But the man himself was impossible to pin down . Only now , seeing him again after so long , did Abby recognize that he 'd abandoned the charisma he 'd used to skate over life . <p> " Thank you . " Abby undid the clasp and set the bracelet back in its box . <p> " Abby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to talk about it , Donovan . It 's over . I 'm over it . I 've moved on . So should you . " <p> " You sound so hard . I do n't remember that about you . " <p> She stared straight at him . <p> " Time and circumstances do that to you , Donovan . " <p> He returned her look without flinching . <p> " Maybe you should tell me what you think happened that night , Abby , " he said , a quiet tension threading his voice . " What did your mother say ? " <p> " What 's the point of rehashing that period of our lives ? It 's over . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I need to get back to work . " Abby turned her back , pretending to concentrate on her ring . <p> A few minutes later , she heard the door close . <p> Her legs weakened and she had to sit down for a minute to regain her equanimity . <p> So Donovan was back . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . He 's probably here for only a month or two , anyway . Donovan never sticks to anything anyway . " At least not the Donovan she remembered . <p> For his first week at work , Donovan stuck to his office , familiarizing himself with everything about Weddings by Woodwards . Wednesday night he stayed late , poring over the ad campaigns the company had used in the past . <p> Puzzled by something he read , Donovan was doing a survey of the sales floor when he saw a light shining in a back room . He checked it out and then wished he 'd stayed upstairs . <p> Abby was hunched over a table , her face determined as she twisted one of the ring 's claws tighter . <p> " It must be tough to find the spare time to do what you love . " <p> " That 's life . " Abby ignored him . <p> " Tell me more about this contest . " He poked his finger at the fake stone . <p> " It 's for jewelry designers across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . " <p> " Meaning the chichi moneyed set ? " he pressed on , determined to get rid of the tension between them . <p> " Meaning people who know jewelry , " Abby substituted . " The kind of people I want to know better . In New York . " <p> Donovan detested the snappish self-righteous tone in her voice . He was the good guy here . Five years ago , he 'd given her the chance to pursue her dreams . <p> " You never let anything stand in the way of your goals , do you , Abby ? " <p> " What does that mean ? " she demanded , her forehead pleated in a fierce frown . " Do you ? " <p> Donovan sighed . What was he doing  --  trying to make her admit he 'd been right to leave ? <p> " Grandmother says your designs are hot at Woodwards . " <p> " Sales have been going well . " She set the ring down before facing him . " Why are you back , Donovan ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Do not take offense , he ordered himself . <p> " It was time . " <p> " Why now ? " <p> " Grandmother wants a new marketing campaign that will spread the company logo across the country . Something young and hip , " he explained . " If the Chicago store goes well , she thinks she might start another on the East Coast , provided I can up our brand recognition to national status . I 'm to get to work and earn my keep . " <p> " Oh . No one told me about another store , but then , why would they ? " <p> Donovan winced at the hint that even though Abby had always been like one of the Woodward family when they were dating , there was no reason for them to consider her as part of their inner circle since he 'd left . He had n't considered how that might impact her . <p> " I heard you were working with one of Winifred 's contacts in Paris and enjoying it , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had some changes in my life , " he said . " I thought maybe you 'd heard . " <p> " Heard what ? " <p> " I brought someone home with me . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Her name is Ariane . " <p> Something flickered through Abby 's expressive eyes , but it was gone so fast he could n't decipher it . <p> " She 's seven . " <p> " Seven ? " Abby blinked . <p> " I 'm her godfather . " He saw her disbelief . " Improbable as that may sound , it 's the truth . " <p> " I see . " Abby kept staring at him . <br> Continues ...
