<p> Commuters navigating Galleria-area roads these days find themselves trapped in traffic snarls and roadblocks as multiple governmental agencies juggle road projects . <p> Though not as massive in size as the Texas Department of Transportation 's ongoing West Loop renovation , a San Felipe Road project has encountered its share of snags as officials struggle to secure land to move forward with certain segments and attempt to keep traffic flowing in areas under construction . <p> The city of Houston and Uptown Development Authority have divided responsibility for that $ 29 million project , which stretches from West Loop 610 to Buffalo Bayou . <p> Though the Uptown Authority completed the first segment of its project one year ago - the reconstruction of San Felipe from Yorktown to Sage roads - officials said they are at least seven months away from breaking ground on the Sage Road-to-West Loop stretch . <p> The major hold-up , said John Breeding , chairman of the Uptown Development Authority , is and always has been buying the land needed to do the work . <p> The goal of the project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Felipe Road so that it matches up to the three lanes in each direction that run from Sage Road west toward Beltway 8 . <p> Now there are three eastbound lanes between Sage and the West Loop , but only two westbound lanes . <p> The result is a bottleneck through the Uptown/Post Oak area . <p> Breeding said things are moving along well west of Post Oak Boulevard . He said the authority has bought more than one-third of the land needed for the project in that area , and is about to wrap up several other contracts . <p> " Once we wrap those up we can start construction on San Felipe between Sage and Post Oak Boulevard , " Breeding said , " and we will continue to work on buying the land needed east of the Post Oak Boulevard-San Felipe intersection . " <p> Breeding said the authority continues to work with reluctant property owners to come to some sort of agreement . <p> " Many have built right on the property lines , so if we take an inch , we are into their businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down and talk about how to minimize the impacts , but in the end some will be impacted more than others . " <p> Negotiations are at a standstill with a group of businesses on the northeast corner of San Felipe and Post Oak Boulevard . <p> Those three property owners - Gary Toy , whose family owns the corner lot that houses Hunan Oaks Chinese Restaurant ; Louis Hoffman , owner of Brucette 's Shoes ; and Catherine Cash , whose family owns the lot on the opposite side of Brucette 's - say the city is unfairly targeting their properties to widen San Felipe Road through that area and leaving larger properties untouched along the way . <p> Toy said lately the Uptown Authority has not tried to contact them . <p> " They have been pretty quiet - we think they are trying to keep us in the dark , " Toy said . " We are kind of worried because we think they are trying to find out what they can get away with . " <p> Further down San Felipe , the city of Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fountainview Drive . <p> " We should be completed by the end of the summer - there 's a whole lot of concrete out there now , " said Mike Howard , District G Houston City Councilman Bert Keller 's chief of staff . <p> Though it is slow-going in that area , the real traffic snarl lies west in the segment under construction between the Bering Ditch and Buffalo Bayou . The city has completed work on the two lanes on the north side of the street , and is finishing up the two south-side lanes . <p> In an effort to keep lanes open in each direction at all times , Howard said city crews paved over the median so that people can drive on that while the main lanes are under construction . <p> The result , he said , is a rather lop-sided detour lane in some areas . <p> Once the south lanes are finished the city will open them up and go to work on building center lanes in the median area . <p> Howard said the temporary inconvenience will be worth the wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that area by San Felipe . <p> " We are trying to be smart about this and do all that we can while the street is torn up , " Howard said . " We are trying to take care of the infrastructure under the street - drainage , water lines , sanitary sewer - while we are there . We know how much people hate to have their street torn up and then have someone come back and tear it up again to replace a pipeline or something else a year later . " <p> Howard said the city is working with the Briargrove Property Owners Association to make sure there are as few impacts to the neighborhood as possible during the construction process . <p> Howard said the Chimney Rock to Yorktown and Fountainview to Chimney Rock phases will begin in 2004 and 2005 , respectively . Both will take about a year to complete . <p> Robert Taube , director of engineering and construction for the Uptown Authority , said there are several other side streets under construction or in the design stage that , while inconvenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Galleria area . <p> Those include the reconstruction of Chimney Rock Road between Richmond Avenue and U.S. 59 ; West Alabama Road between Post Oak Boulevard and the West Loop ; and McCue Street between Guilford and Westheimer roads ; and widening of South Rice Avenue under U.S. 59 to coincide with the Westpark Toll Road exit lanes . <p> Taube said the authority broke ground on the South Rice project two weeks ago , and it working with the Harris County Toll Road Authority on the project . Though the project only adds one lane in each direction , the actual open area under the freeway will be doubled in size . <p> Breeding said the authority had to purchase one house in neighboring Larchmont Terrace to accommodate the wider lanes , but said it was a " friendly acquisition . " <p> Philip Brinson , vice president of the Larchmont Civic Association , said things are looking good for his neighborhood , which has about 300 1950s-era homes in an area bordered by South Rice on the west , U.S. 59 on the north , Chimney Rock Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brinson said the authority will build sound walls along South Rice Avenue and Chimney Rock to shield the neighborhood from traffic noise . A wall already exists along the U.S. 59 frontage road . <p> " Right now we have quite a bit of noise coming from U.S. 59 , around that sound wall - sometimes it is difficult to hear your own neighbor when we are talking in the front yard , " Brinson said . " The two other walls around the neighborhood may help alleviate that noise . " <p> Though work has not started on the West Alabama project , it will provide a tie-in to the West Loop project , Taube said . <p> " Right now West Alabama between Post Oak and the West Loop is a road to nowhere , " Taube said . <p> The authority plans to connect that short segment to a new frontage road that will be constructed as part of the West Loop project . <p> That frontage road connects to a ramp that leads directly to the West Loop southbound lanes and U.S. 59 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Westheimer Road , he said , because people can use it as an alternate route to the freeway . <p> Road crews have vacated several finished project sites , including Sage Road , which was widened from four to six lanes from West Alabama to Hidalgo streets ; the Uptown Park Boulevard-South Post Oak intersection ; and the south end of Post Oak Boulevard , which was enlarged to mesh with lanes exiting the future Westpark Toll Road at the Richmond intersection .
