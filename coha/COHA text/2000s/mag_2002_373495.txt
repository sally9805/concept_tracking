After being shot down over Bosnia in 1995 , U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady survived for days by eating insects . Surviving in Hollywood may prove equally arduous . O'Grady filed suit last week against 20th Century Fox , claiming that the 2001 movie Behind Enemy Lines , about a U.S. soldier shot down over Bosnia , ripped him off . But last November , before he saw the film , O'Grady told TIME he had read the script and was n't bothered by similarities . " Anything that 's semipatriotic is good because I 'm patriotic , " he said . A Fox representative says , " We were surprised because at the time of release , Mr. O'Grady 's public comments acknowledged that the movie was not his story . " What changed ? Just before the film 's release , O'Grady learned that Fox was advertising the movie during the Discovery Channel documentary Behind Enemy Lines : The Scott O'Grady Story  --  a tactic he says exploited him . ( The channel is named in the suit . ) According to his complaint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the Fox movie used foul language , was portrayed as a ' hot dog ' type pilot , and disobeyed orders . " O'Grady claims that earlier this year Fox " admitted " the movie was based on his 1995 autobiography . He is suing for unspecified damages and a share of the film 's profits .  --  By Jess Cagle
