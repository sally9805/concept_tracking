You 've probably noticed that wireless is the buzz word of the hour . Telephones , personal digital assistants , computers  --  and all the things that you can attach to them , from mice to modems  --  are shedding their wires and taking on a life of their own . Even the Internet itself is being reborn as the Wireless Internet , with a horde of NASDAQ companies offering novel ways to connect sans cords . <P> Naturally enough , all this activity calls for a new silly abbreviation : <P> Wi-Fi . While nothing bores me more than new standards , look for Wi-Fi compatibility as you shop for wireless stuff . The name stands for " wireless fidelity " ; what it means is that any network devices that are Wi-Fi certified can work together . Why should you care ? Because increasingly , you 'll be able to use these devices in public places like airport lounges , hotels and fast-food joints to find and hop onto high-speed connections to the Net . <P> Here 's how it works . Say you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to the Internet via a cable modem , and you have a wireless connection from your PC to a laptop . You can move around with your laptop from room to room , even take it out to the backyard swimming pool , and still connect wirelessly to your network , as well as to the great Net beyond . Your connection between the laptop and PC is fast , about 11 Mbps , the same speed as the Ethernet networks businesses use to interconnect their computers , by wires , at work . That 's fast enough , by the way , to watch a movie on your laptop that 's actually running in the DVD drive of your desktop 300 ft. away . <P> Today you can take that same laptop with the Wi-Fi wireless network card to the Austin Bergstrom Airport , in Austin , Texas . For a fee , you can connect to the Wi-Fi-compatible network there and roar out onto the Internet . Or go to any one of 30 hotels in Tampa , Fla. , Phoenix , Ariz. , and Austin and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than 1,000 hotels and 25 major airports in the U.S. are expected to offer this service ; a dozen airports in Europe will also have it and be compatible . I 'm told that a major coffee chain whose name I 'm not allowed to mention will even be offering Wi-Fi service by the end of the year . <P> I have n't tried the airport service yet , so I do n't know if there are other , hidden hells involved in connecting to a public , commercial wireless network . I did , however , set up one of the new generation of wireless networks . I used the Dell 4800LT Wireless PC Card ( $139 ) for my laptop and the corresponding PCI Card ( $179 ) for my desktop . Compaq , 3Com , Lucent and others also have Wi-Fi-compatible setups comparable to Dell 's , which range in price from $100 to $300 per card . <P> The last time I tried to set up a wireless network at home , both my PC and , worse , my wife 's crashed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system comes with a CD-ROM that has a video-based setup tutorial that , among other things , explains  --  as well as shows  --  how to put a PCI card into your desktop machine . Once installed , the network performed smoothly and without glitches . I ca n't wait to start using it at the coffee shop . <P> For more on Wi-Fi and wireless networks , go to
