ONE <br> At sunrise on Monday morning , May 2 , 1887 , fifty-year-old Dan Haddock awakened in the bedroom of the apartment above his furniture store in Denver , Colorado . <br> Dan rubbed his eyes , rolled over in the bed , and glanced at the large window , which was on the east wall of the room . The eastern horizon was rose-flushed and golden . Above the glowing rim of the sun , the intense purity of the blue sky was a sight to see . " What a beautiful world You made , Lord , " he said in an appreciative whisper . <br> The owner of Haddock 's Furniture Store rubbed his eyes again , and this time when he opened them , his line of sight settled on a ten-by-twelve-inch framed picture that sat on the nearby dresser . Suddenly , as <br> he focused on the face of the lovely woman in the photograph , Dan was overcome with emotion . His eyes filled with tears as he stared with infinite tenderness at the face . He swallowed hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you terribly ! " <br> Suddenly his mind was filled with precious memories . Dan thought of the day he first met Rebecca Jardine when they both attended a tent revival in Jefferson City , Missouri , in June of 1856 ; he was nineteen and she a year younger . When the evangelist who preached the meeting finished a powerful gospel sermon , both had walked the aisle and had received the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour . Both were baptized in the church that had sponsored the tent revival and attended the serviceswhenever the doors of the church were open . They began seeing each other on a regular basis and soon fell in love . They were married in October of that same year , after he turned twenty and Rebecca nineteen . <br> Dan thought of when they moved to Denver in July of 1871 and opened the furniture store . They very much loved their new church in Denver and enjoyed serving the Lord . <br> His mind then went to March of 1885 , when his dear wife came down with a serious case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the doctors and nurses , died in April at Denver 's Mile High Hospital . <br> Heavy of heart and missing Rebecca so very much , Dan sat up in bed and lifted his Bible from the nightstand . Needing comfort , he turned to Revelation 21:4 and read about the future of the saved people in heaven 's holy city , the New Jerusalem : " And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away . " <br> Tears spilled down Dan 's cheeks , and he sniffled . " Oh , Rebecca , sweetheart , when you and I are together in heaven , God 's going to wipe away all our tears . There wo n't be any more crying  --  " He choked and brushed the tears from his cheeks . " There wo n't be any more crying , darling , because there 'll be no more death , no more sorrow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " Oh , dear Lord , I 'll be so glad when Rebecca and I are together again . Of course , Lord Jesus , when I first get to heaven , I want to see You , look into Your eyes , and thank You in person for dying on the cross for me and for saving me that day at the tent revival Then I want to see my dear Rebecca and hold her in my arms again . " <br> This time Dan used the bed sheet to dry the tears from his eyes and face , then rose from the bed and made it up . After shaving and grooming himself and dressing in one of his business suits , he went to the kitchen and cooked breakfast . <br> At eight thirty , Dan descended the stairs and entered his furniture store through its rear door . He had swept the store clean after closing late Saturday afternoon , and as he made his way toward the front door , he smiled as he looked around and admired the tidiness . When he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> waved at a man and his wife who were walking along the boardwalk toward their clothing store . They smiled and waved back . Dan then flipped the Closed sign on the door window to Open and unlocked the door . He was ready for the new business day . <br> Just as he was turning away from the door , he noticed a young man ride up on a white horse and pull rein at the hitching post . His face looked vaguely familiar , but Dan could n't think of where he might have seen him before . He was probably going to do business in one of the other stores . <br> As Dan walked toward the counter , he smiled . " Thank You , Lord , for helping Haddock 's Furniture Store do so well since Rebecca and I opened it here almost sixteen years ago . " <br> His smile faded as Dan thought of Rebecca again . He missed her so very much . However , as he walked behind the counter , he reminded himself that whenever it was the Lord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rebecca againand this time forever . <br> Dan then bent down to get into the safe below the counter . He glanced at the .45-caliber revolver that was on top of the safe as a security measure , then quickly turned the dial , working the correct combination . When the dial gave off its satisfying click , he opened the safe 's door and lifted out a bag of currency . He took a specific amount of money from the bag and placed it by denomination in the various sections of the cash register 's drawer . He placed the rest of the money back in the safe , closed the door , and spun the dial . <br> Just then the front door opened , and Dan looked up to see the vaguely familiar young man step into the store with a fierce look in his eyes . Dan 's eyes immediately took in the revolver in the man 's hand as he closed the door behind himself . Fear gripped Dan 's heart , black and cold . He recognized the man now . He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times on Wanted posters on the big board in front of chief United States marshal John Brockman 's office at the federal building in the center of downtown Denver . Dan 's blood froze . <br> The look in the outlaw 's eyes was even more piercing as he rushed up to the counter , pointing his gun at Dan . He spoke harshly , through his teeth . " I 've been watchin ' you through the window , mister ! I saw you put that money in the drawer , and I know you have more down there behind the counter . I want it all . Give it to me now , or I 'll kill you ! " <br> Dan 's chest was tight , and he could only breathe shallowly , but anger welled up inside him . He leaned down as if reaching for the other cash and grabbed his .45-caliber revolver . As he raised the gun , Kelner fired first . The roar of Kelner 's weapon thundered throughout the store . The bullet struck Dan in the chest , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter to the safe . As he gripped the handle , he knew immediately that it was locked . Realizing that someone on the street might have heard the shot and called for the law , Kelner opened the cash register drawer , grabbed the money there , stuffed it in his pockets , and dashed out the door . He swung into the saddle on his white horse and galloped away . <br> Continues ...
