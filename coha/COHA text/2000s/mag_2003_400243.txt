" Tapestry " is a mischievous word . It first conjures up massive rectangles of wool tableaux , sumptuous and stately . But a more precise reading emerges from the catalog of the " American Tapestry Biennial IV , " which defines tapestry as " handwoven weft-faced fabric with discontinuous wefts . " From that vantage , tapestry is not so much the woven fabric as the process for weaving it , or more accurately , for not weaving it - the weft threads do not run the full width of the underlying parallel warp threads . Such technical guidelines can give an artist immense creative license and push weaving into unexplored terrain . With few exceptions , the works in this touring biennial , which is sponsored by the American Tapestry Alliance , propel the traditional concept of tapestry into new territory . This is accomplished with great skill and deliberation-tapestry is amongthe most painstaking media ; the artist Joanna Foslien compares the process to " erosion in reverse " - but the overall effect of walking through the exhibit resembles careening around a theme park fun house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a look down at bacteria or a look up at galaxies ? Is Jean Smelker-Hugi 's Nordland3 , 2001 , a mountain range silhouetted against a sunset or a flash-lit stalactite hanging in a dark cave ? Nearly a third of the works burst out of the right-angle box , and two of the best , juror Christine Laffer 's Signs of a Shift , .999 , and Jon Eric Riis 's Babes in Arms , 2001 , take human form with unnerving results ( more on this later ) . " American " is almost a misnomer for the show-eight of the 26 artists hail from Europe ; four are Canadian . The three jurors , all of whom exhibit , are from Germany ( Peter Horn ) , California ( Laffer ) and Quebec ( Marcel Marois ) . It seems a shame that of the 140 submissions none from Latin America or the Middle East made the cut , especially given the impact cultures in those regions have had on the evolution of tapestry . But this may just be a ( politically correct ) quibble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global medium , and contemporary works , in particular , revel in transcending borders . In ancient times tapestry took root in disparate places nearly simultaneously , and its history has been a tale of artists and techniques hopscotching from one country to another . By now there is no uniform look among tapestries from the same nation . The three Hungarian exhibitors run the gamut : Judit Baranyi 's heraldic Honour for " Vorad , " 2001 , is an ornate tribute to an mth-century knight king ; Ildiko Dobranyi 's diptych , Grasses , 1999 , shimmers with electric color and dynamism ; Ibolya Hegyi 's Golden Age , 2001 , is an hourglass made of two kissing triangles that , at close inspection , glitter with grains of sand made from tiny loops of gold . The impact of location and distance on a tapestry viewer is what inspired Judy Schuster to create Kurt and /ed , 1999 , a paean to the playfulness of the Op-Art movement . The tapestry 's cartoon , or background image , is a black-and-white snapshot of the smiling faces of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture with broken vertical lines of lavender , rose , gold , rust and sky blue . From 50 feet away , the faces leap from the frame , mottled but vivid . From 15 feet , the boys peek out from behind the rainbow bars of a hovering gate . Up close , they vanish into an abstract grid of erratic stripes made of soft fat loops . In a similar vein , Sharon Marcus has followed her passion for archaeology in the lo-part Walls of China , zoos . From a near point each weaving is like a patch of brown earth with glints of silvery warp . Farther away , the set resembles shards of broken pottery waiting to be fitted and glued back together .

Feliksas Jakubauskas 's Melancholy August , 2001 , juxtaposes a tidy rectangle of classic floral needlepoint with a rough diamond of crisscrossed wool , silk and synthetics , both floating in a dark blue swirling sky . Two kindred works marry symbols of weaving and weaver . Susan Iverson 's Horizon - Dreaming Sacsahuaman , 2001 , brackets a jumbled anonymous head between two flat white panels with dramatically undulating hems , which she created using a pulled warp technique . In Jane Kidd 's Handwork Series : to the bone , in the blood , from the heart , 2000 , each of six panels is a layered pairing of traditional woven cloth and the skeleton-muscular digits that produced it . Kidd reminds us that every thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By disembodying those hands ( one resembles a tarantula ) , she raises the specter of weaving as a metaphysical arena where subconscious forces channel startling visions through submissive fingers . In terms of scale , an important element in tapestry , four works of special note are paired at opposite poles . At the towering extreme , there are Brita Breen 's go-by-39-inch Sketch One , 1999 , a richly hued grid of wavering boxes that could pass for an office floor plan sketched by a drunken architect , and Lialia Kuchma 's 132-by-48-inch Thomas , 2000 , an asymmetrical chartreuse profusion . At the miniature extreme , Anne McGinn made Recycled Stanley : Catalog Only Items 1-4 , 2000 , a quartet of luminous 3-by- 3-inch panels , because , she writes , " at this scale , tapestry 's surface density and complexity are as deceptively simple as they are confounding . " And Mary Lane 's 7 1/2-by-8-inch Annie 's Green Dress , 2000 , a textile representing a textile , is minimal and mesmerizing . Finally , the two showstoppers . Any qualms about rewarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dispelled by Christine Laffer 's Signs ofa Shift . Intrigued by tapestry as a medium of sculpture that can refer to what she calls " garments and torsos in combination ... and to bodily substances that thread can represent , " Laffer begins at the top with two straps of a bluish  --  white halter dress ( envision Marilyn Monroe over the subway grate ) . As your eye travels down , the dress begins to fill out with small jutting breasts ; the V of a crotch appears over plump thighs ; under the full , long skirt , two shadowed Rubensesque legs are coyly pressed together at the knees and calves . The tapestry ends with bare feet and dark foreshortened toes , an ominous coda to the torso 's symphonic vitality . And then there is Babes in Arms , a work so provocative that the William D. Cannon Art Gallery in Carlsbad , California , where I saw the show , kept it tucked away in a corner during normal exhibition hours and shrouded it when schoolchildren came for tours . Jon Eric Riis presents three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing identical 19th-century orange floor-length gowns , and all are loosely holding guns-a revolver for one , an assault rifle for another , an automatic pistol for the third . To ratchet up the eeriness , Riis has covered the gowns with lustrous beads , and the dolls ' faces and hair are finely detailed . As you walk around from front to back , you can see little rows of buttons on the backs of the gowns , and the preciousness seems overwhelming . In his exhibition statement , Riis explains that he has merged the Americana of the rag dolls with " the beaded garments of the Ibeji ( twin ) cult figures from the Yoruba people of Nigeria ( although my figures are triplets ) . " The driving concept behind this , he writes , is " the loss of innocence in our troubled contemporary society . " Gazing at these woven cherubs and pondering the horrific threshold they stand upon , you realize that , by exchanging the safety of decorativeness for the tumult of artistic dissonance , contemporary tapestry has entered a new era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Milkmaid , 2000 , tapestry , 59 by 44 inches , BOTTOM : SHARON MARCUS , Oregon  --  Walls of China , 2001 , wedge-weave tapestry , 10 by 72 inches .
