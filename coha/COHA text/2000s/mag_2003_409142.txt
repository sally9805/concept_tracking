MANY HIKERS THINK BACKCOUNTRY LAKES AND STREAMS ARE SWIMMING WITH GIARDIA AND OTHER STOMACH-CHURNING BUGS . BUT OUR EXCLUSIVE INVESTIGATION TELLS A REMARKBLY DIFFERENT TALE - ONE THAT MAY CHANGE YOUR DRINKING HABITS . BY PETER JARET // When Karen Najarian takes wkers into the backcountiy in her official role as a wilderness guide , she 's adamant : Treat the water before you drink it . Boil it , filter it , purify it- just do n't drink it untreated . But when Najarian heads out into the Sierra Nevada with a group of longtime backpacking friends , it 's a much different story . " We 've pretty much stopped treating the water , " says Najarian . " The last two hikes I did in Yosemite , I did n't even take a filter . We just dipped into the river and drank . " Najarian and her companions are n't alone . In recent years , many backpackers have questioned the need to treat water . Perhaps you remember an idyllic time , barely a generation back , when we were ignorant of bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling creeks without fear or consequence . Or maybe you know someone like Najarian , who returns from a trek looking fit , healthy , happy , and extolling the virtues of unfiltered alpine water . In either case , you 'll find yourself weighing that half-pound pump in your hand or considering the wait and hassle of chemicals , and asking yourself , How dangerous could the water be ? How dangerous ? Read the warnings from companies who make decontamination devices and you 'd think you were entering a Superfund site . " No water sources should be considered safe to drink without treatment , " cautions the maker of one popular filter . Ask Gary Rosenlieb , who heads up the National Park Service 's water quality program , and you 'll get a similarly stern warning : " No matter how pristine the setting , backcountry users should never assume that a particular water source is free from viral , bacterial , or parasitic contamination . Purification of water is a must . " The agency 's Back Country Expedition Checklist calls not only for treating water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dishes . The NPS position is echoed by epidemiologist Michael Beach , Ph.D. , a specialist in waterborne diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , who says : " We highly recommend treating water from every source in the backcountry . You do n't know what 's upstream-not just people but animals-and you can get infected . " But pose the question to Robert W. Derlet , M.D. , a professor of medicine at the University of California at Davis and a passionate backpacker who has logged hundreds of days hiking along the Pacific Crest Trail , and you 'll get a remarkably different answer . " The warnings about backcountry water quality are vastly exaggerated , " says Dr. Derlet , whose studies of the subject have been funded in part by a grant from the Wilderness Medical Society . " Most of them are based on rumor and hearsay , nothing more . The chances of picking up a bug are very slim , and the chances of actually getting sick are much , much slimmer . " Who 's right ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tap in your own home ? To begin clearing these murky waters , BACKPACKER conducted a groundbreaking investigation . Last spring and summer , we tested backcountry water sources across the country , from the Catskills to the Sierra ( see The Water Report Card on page 58 ) in order to add new data to the existing studies on waterborne organisms in the wilderness . We also consulted microbiology experts from academia , government , and private industry to find out how much they know-and do n't know-about the real risks lurking in rivers and lakes , and what you can do to protect your health . What we found will surprise you . MeetTheBeast If there 's a face associated with waterborne microorganisms , it belongs to Giardia intestinalis . This little bug , a protozoan so small that 30,000 of them could party on a pinhead , became hiker enemy number one back in the 1970s , following a surge in backpacker-reported cases of giardia infections ( technically called giardiasis , but better known as really horrendous diarrhea , often accompanied by cramps , vomiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken lightly ) . Between 1965 and 1977 , annual reported cases rose from 123 to 1,058 . But did giardia emerge like a plague from the backcountry ? No . Contrary to trailhead mythology , giardiasis is not a hiker 's illness . It 's everyone 's . The protozoan turns up regularly in the general population-anyone can be infected and not have symptoms , or have symptoms that come and go . And a lot of people play host to these bugs . In a 1995 report , the CDC analyzed data from state health departments around the country that had tested more than 200,000 stool samples of sick patients . Giardia showed up in 7.2 percent-up from 4 percent in 1979 . The increase in cases among backpackers seems to mirror a rise in the population at large . As Dr. Beach , the CDC expert , says , " The record numbers we began seeing could be the result of increased awareness , more reporting , more investigation by local health departments . " So how many backpackers come down with waterborne infections in the wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy . When waterborne pathogens invade a community swimming pool , a municipal water supply , or a cruise ship , people fall ill in droves and the outbreak grabs the attention of public health officials . Not so for backpackers . Hikers who get the runs typically do n't report their symptoms to health officials ( especially since giardiasis disappears on its own or is routinely treated with antibiotics ) . The result : Experts admit they really do n't know the extent of the problem . Whatever the actual number is , the percentage of people infected with giardia or crypto who get it from guzzling backcountry water is probably small . In 1991 , state health departments reported 34,348 cases of giardiasis . Among them , however , only two minor outbreaks were reported among individuals identified as campers or backpackers . In a 1995 article in Wilderness and Environmental Medicine , Thomas R. Welch , M.D. , a mountain guide and board member of the Wilderness Education Association , reported , " The surveillance data of state health departments indicate that giardiasis is a common communicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , provide any evidence that wilderness water is an important cause of the disease in this country . " Nearly all documented outbreaks of cryptosporidia infection are associated with swimming pools . As a recent CDC report on waterborne disease outbreaks puts it , " Because swimming is essentially a shared water activity ... rinsing of soiled bodies and overt fecal accidents cause contamination of the water . " Of course , backpackers do get sick on the trail . While no one tracks numbers nationwide , a 1997 study of Appalachian Trail thru-hikers is revealing . University of Minnesota researchers convinced 280 AT hikers to fill out a questionnaire after their treks . An unsettling 56 percent reported suffering diarrhea-making it the most common illness they experienced . A figure like that could make anyone think wilderness waterways are swarming with bad bugs . In reality , they 're not . What'sInTheWater ? If Vegas ever lets you wager on the chances of finding giardia in a random drink from your favorite lake or stream , put your Benjamins on clean water . Odds are three-to-one in your favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources three separate times . Of those 21 distinct " snapshots , " six-about a quarter-tested positive for giardia . " The BACKPACKER results mirror what we see in many studies . About 25 percent of tests for giardia turn up positive , but at very low levels , " says Michigan State University microbiologist and water expert Joan B. Rose , Ph.D. , who has conducted her own studies on the subject . " Cryptosporidia is much more erratic . Some years levels are high . Others we hardly find any at all . Wildlife can be chronic carriers of giardia , which explains why we tend to find it most of the time . " The BACKPACKER test found crypto only once . In 1984 , the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Department of Public Health analyzed water from 69 Sierra Nevada stream sites for evidence of giardia . Cysts ( single giardia protozoans ) were found at 43 percent of the high-use sites and 19 percent of the low-use sites . But it 's important to put numbers like these in perspective . When American Water tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian province in 1991 , giardia showed its pretty face in 17 percent of the samples , crypto in 27 percent . ( Follow-up investigations showed that most bugs were no longer viable or able to cause infection . The Environmental Protection Agency EPA upgraded municipal water treatment regulations shortly thereafter , and experts agree that giardia levels today are much lower than in 1991 . ) Even with more stringent standards , the EPA estimates as many as 250 out of every 10,000 people come down with giardia infections from drinking water in the United States every year , including well and tap water . Yet even with the odds in your favor , our test and others show that betting on giardia- or crypto-free water is a game of chance . One reason you can never be certain : Nobody regularly monitors the level of disease-causing pathogens in backcountry water . There are simply too many sources spread over too large a territory . Plus , microbiologists like Dr. Rose and Dr. Beach say the tests themselves are not completely reliable when it comes to catching all microorganisms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EPA , admits , " States have to prioritize scant monitoring dollars on waters of concern , so what we know about backcountry water is pretty hit or miss . " Another challenge is the fluid nature of water itself . Surface sources change by the season , the week , even the day . Tests provide only fleeting-albeit useful-snapshots , capturing conditions at a specific time and place . The BACKPACKER survey bolsters what many experts say : The presence of contaminants in remote water sources varies over time , even with samples taken from the exact same location . At first glance , our findings do n't appear to offer much comfort to backpackers thinking of dipping a bottle into a sun-dappled stretch of the Merced or Chattooga Rivers . But look deeper , and there are surprises . First , the results offer proof that some sources are more likely to be contaminated than others . Even more significantly , a positive test for giardia or crypto does n't mean the source is dangerous . What finally matters is whether you 're likely to clrink enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swallowing a single microbe could make you sick-but that would be very bad luck indeed . To infect you , an intestinal parasite must be hearty enough to sidestep your immune system , get into your gut , attach itself , and multiply . Researchers call the number of bugs typically required to make people sick the " infectious dose , " and it varies widely from organism to organism-and person to person . Take cryptosporidia . At the University of Texas Medical School in Houston , a group of brave research subjects were fed capsules containing doses of live cryptosporidia . The infectious dose-the number of organisms required to cause illness in 50 percent of the volunteers-varied from nine to 1,049 cysts . That research set the average infectious dose at about 132 cysts . For giardia , the number is around 10 to 25 organisms , according to the CDC 's Dr. Beach , who cites a 1954 study in which equally intrepid volunteers were given capsules containing giardia cysts . The figures are shown as a range because some strains cause sickness at low concentrations ; other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by immune response , body size , and other factors . Our survey , like previous studies , found that even where giardia or cryptosporidia turns up in backcountry water , they are usually well below the concentrations that would expose most healthy adults to an infectious dose . When we found giardia in North Carolina 's Chattooga River , for instance , the average concentration was .8 cysts per liter . At that level , you 'd typically need to drink more than 10 liters in a single day to swallow enough organisms to get an infectious dose . Even if you are the unlucky hiker who guzzles a single microbe , your chances of getting sick are less than one in 100 . Other studies show similar concentrations . In its 2003 report on six watersheds ( five in the United States , one in Canada ) , American Water found that 23 percent of the test samples contained viable giardia cysts , and 4 percent contained viable crypto . However , levels were so low that your chance of ingesting an infectious dose from drinking 1 untreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who get infected never experience symptoms , the practical risk of getting sick would be even lower . You do n't have to worry about organisms accumulating over a weeklong trek , says Dr. Derlet , since your body fights them off on a daily basis . Dr. Derlet , who is conducting a study of backcountry water sources in the Sierra , puts it bluntly : " If you averaged every drop of water from every lake in the Sierra and put it in a reservoir , you 'd have to drink 250 gallons to get enough giardia to make you sick . " Indeed , Dr. Welch argues , " Getting sick from backcountry water is like being attacked by a shark-a veiy rare event that has been blown way out of proportion by the public and the press . " TheHiddenCuiprit If the water is safe , why did so many of the hikers in the Appalachian Trail study report getting sick ? In fact , some of them likely did fall victim to contaminated streams . After all , they were on the trail for months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a region with higher-than-average incidence of giardia . ( In our study , the two sites along the Appalachian corridor collectively tested positive for giardia cysts 50 percent of the time-more than twice the rate of all other samples-and the Chattooga River site in North Carolina had the test 's highest concentration of cysts . ) Indeed , in the 1997 AT study , David Boulware , MD. , of the University of Minnesota found that hikers who scrupulously sanitized their drinking water were less likely to have diarrhea than those who did n't . But treating water was no guarantee of good health . Of those who consistently disinfected , 45 percent still reported bouts of diarrhea . How did they get it ? Most likely , they were infected by fellow hikers . Both giardia and cryptosporidia , as well as other gut-wrenching microorganisms , can be transmitted when someone carrying the bugs is a little too casual about cleanliness-specifically , not washing their hands thoroughly after defecating . " Poor hygiene is a great amplifier of these infections , " says the CDC 's Dr. Michael Beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating utensils and washing hands regularly with soap and water proved to be more effective at reducing the risk of diarrhea than treating water . In his report in Wilderness and Environmental Medicine , Dr. Welch came to the same conclusion : Drinking backcountry water is n't the problem . " Given the casual approach to personal hygiene that characterizes most backpacking treks , hand washing is likely to be a much more useful preventive strategy than water disinfection , " he advises . " This simple expedient , strictly enforced in health care , child care , and food service settings , is rarely mentioned in wilderness education materials . " The bottom line : Probably the single most important thing you can do is insist on good personal hygiene for everyone in your party-which primarily means washing hands carefully after wiping and before preparing food . Experts recommend using soap and water or an antimicrobial hand sanitizer . ToTreatOrNotToTreat All the evidence says the risks of drinking untreated backcountry water are small , but not nonexistent . At a particular stream or creek , there 's no way anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You stop at a sparkling creek high in the Rockies , parched from carrying a pack under a blistering summer sun , and nothing sounds sweeter than scooping up a cup of the crystal clear , cold water . But should you treat it ? Ultimately , that 's a question only you can answer , by using sound judgment about the creek in question and about your own body . Water quality in the wilderness is constantly changing , depending on the season , the amount of water flowing , and what animals or other hikers happen to be doing upriver . In our test , sources that were contaminated during one sampling were free of microorganisms at others . In all our findings , giardia and cryptosporidia levels for a liter of water were well below the level of infectious doses . Even more significantly , in five of the seven positive tests , the cysts found were not viable ( able to cause illness ) . But that does n't guarantee that samples taken the next day would have been safe . " Risk in this area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tod Schimelpfenig , curriculum director for the Wilderness Medicine Institute , of the Wyoming-based National Outdoor Leadership School . " Sample a creek at one point in time and you could have a flush of organisms from an animal that just defecated upstream . Sample it 20 feet upstream 2 hours later and you could find nothing . The risk of drinking untreated water in wilderness areas depends entirely on when and where . " Schimelpfenig officially recommends treating all drinking water in the backcountry , but adds , " Are there places where I 'm personally comfortable drinking water without treating it ? Sure . " Even the experts are divided over the proper course of action . " I do n't trust any surface water any longer , " says Bruce Macler , a drinking-water toxicologist for the EPA and national expert on microbial risk , who is also an avid hiker . " Other people are the issue-and there are very few places that have n't had people near them . No one can say what the risk is . It might be one in 100 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that chance . " Lisa Lange , microbiologist and clean water specialist at Cascade Designs ( which makes SweetWater and MSR treatment products ) has a different take . " Susceptibility , water sources , and activity are the three factors that influence my choice of water treatment . For example , I have a solid digestive system and do n't usually have gastrointestinal problems . Therefore , I take more risks than some . I am one of a rare breed who believes we have an immune system for a reason . If I am going on a long alpine trip in a remote area where fresh snow is accessible , I will trim weight by not carrying water treatment equipment and select my snow carefully . If , on the other hand , I am car camping in a high-use campground , then I will at the very least filter my water and most likely I will purify it . " Lange , Schimelpfenig , Dr. Derlet , and wilderness guide Najarian all agree on a critical point : The key to drinking safely is paying close attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable nature of contaminants-and our own bodies-leaves a vast gray area between two extremes . At one end is the paranoid perception that every pristine-looking stream is crawling with unseen microbes , while at the other is the blind hope that all water really is as good as it looks . Between these extremes lies the truth . As our test indicates , risk can be minimized . The Chattooga River near the AT , for instance , is a low-elevation stream in a high-use area subject to runoff from a large region . Not surprisingly , it tested positive for giardia two out of three times and had the highest concentration of cysts in the test ( though the level was still too low to make most people sick ) . But the remote Greenwater River in Washington 's Norse Peak Wilderness got a clean bill of health on all three tests . The lesson from these two waterways ? If you know your surroundings and understand the indicators of suspect sources , you can find your comfort zone between the two extremes . Can you eliminate risk entirely ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trailhead-involves some level of risk . Consciously or unconsciously , we do our own personal cost/benefit analysis . For Susan Sanford , one of Najarian 's backpacking companions , the rewards of being able to drink sweet water directly from a pristine river or spring outweigh the dangers . " I 've been hiking long enough to remember when no one thought twice about drinking from a stream , " says Sanford . " Then we began to worry . Now we do n't as much . We 'll filter the water if we 're in an area with a lot of other people , but in remote places , we 'll drink water straight from the source . Believe me , I 'm the last person who wants to get sick on a backpacking trip . But I do n't want to carry a lot of unnecessary worries with me , either . I had n't realized how much I missed being able to take a drink of water without worrying . It feels like coming home .

The increase is due to seasonal runoff and the birth of young animals , which can be susceptible to the microbes . Melted snow is a good bet . If it 's not fresh , scrape off the top layer and melt the clean stuff underneath . Avoid stagnant water .
