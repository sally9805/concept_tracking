<p> THURSDAY THOUGHTS <p> MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY PLAN B <p> Re-signing shortstop Juan Uribe means White Sox general manager Ken Williams has a plan . Possibly as a fallback in case the team fails to land a better shortstop or as trade bait . Or so many Sox fans can hope . <p> - Making Cubs right-hander Ryan Dempster a candidate to become a starter means GM Jim Hendry has a plan . Possibly something more than improving the bullpen by taking him out of it . Or so many Cubs fans can hope . <p> - High expectations entering the season . Slow start . Gradual build toward a playoff run . Yes , the Bulls have their blueprint for success down perfectly . OK , more like " perfectly awful . " <p> - Speaking of words , the Bulls ' locker-room chalkboard ( or whatever they call chalkboards on which magic markers are used ) had this inspirational message of words to live by before the game Tuesday against the Los Angeles Clippers : " We need each other ! That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , not spell by . Talk about being at a loss ( or four of them ) for words . <p> - Speaking of spelling , the lack of offensive cohesion may indicate the Bulls are more disparate than desperate . In that coach Scott Skiles ' starting lineup has been functioning dysfunctionally , it might be time for a change . After all , disparate times call for desperate measures . <p> - Nothing like creating interest in the Blackhawks by showing no  --  count ' em , no ( as in zero , zip , zilch )  --  home games in February . One would think there might have been some availability on Comcast Plus or elsewhere in television land  --  if the team really wanted to show more contests from the United Center . <p> LONG-TERM DEAL <p> NOAH CAN BUILD HIS BRAND <p> Somebody look up the French for " It 's the shoes . " <p> Bulls rookie Joakim Noah has signed a six-year endorsement deal with French footwear and apparel company Le Coq Sportif . <p> That is the same company that his tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sportif has plans for a line of shoes and apparel around Noah . The deal might end up giving the former Florida star an equity stake in the company . <p> The deal was brokered by agents Donald Dell and Bill Strickland of Kentucky-based Blue Equity . Dell , the president of the firm , also helped Michael Jordan partner with Nike . Nike and Adidas also were interested in Noah . <p> So how do the Jordan and Noah deals compare ? <p> " I think they 're very different deals because they 're very different times , " Dell told Quick Hits on Wednesday . " But the concept is the same . When Michael made the second Nike deal , that was a long-term deal . What we 're doing with LCS and Joakim Noah is an opportunity for him to have a royalty involvement in shoes and clothing , both in Europe and , more importantly , in America . <p> " It 's very dissimilar to Nike in the sense that they 're not an established company , although Nike basketball was not that established until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem  --  on the court and off  --  Noah has big shoes to fill . <p> MAIL WAGS <p> BRYANT GETS FAN PARTICIPATION <p> With designs on Michael Jordan 's house and the possibility of taking over his former cubicle in the Bulls ' United Center locker room , what else will Kobe Bryant do to assume MJ 's identity ? <p> That was the question posed to listeners of the " Mac , Jurko &; Harry " show Tuesday on ESPN Radio ( 1000-AM ) . <p> Among the e-mail responses : <p> - The obvious thing Kobe will do : Marry Juanita ! ! ! <p> - When Kobe plays with or against the Bulls , he will clap powdered chalk in Johnny " Red " Kerr 's face . <p> - Start sharing his Hanes with Cuba Gooding Jr . <p> - The next time the Lakers play in Phoenix , Kobe will go to the Suns ' front office and punch Steve Kerr in the mouth for no apparent reason . <p> - After buying MJ 's house in Highland Park and joining the Bulls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulls to win it all ... while riding in a golf cart at Medinah , with the beverage cart girl on his lap , whom he did n't tip . <p> - He must lose a large sum of money in a poker game to Jack Haley and never pay it back . <p> The winning response : <p> - Word on the street is that Kobe has signed on to make " Space Jam 2 . " And , based on the first film , they asked Kobe which not-so-good NBA players he thought would fit the bill , and he suggested Andrew Bynum , Chris Mihm and Kwame Brown . <p> GOING STRONG AT 82 <p> MCKEAGUE STILL GIVING IT A TRI <p> Robert McKeague is an old hand at triathlons . <p> And legs and other body parts , too . The 82-year-old from Villa Park is scheduled to be one of more than 1,500 participants in Saturday 's Ford Ironman World Championship 70.3 in Clearwater Beach , Fla . <p> His chances of repeating as the champion in the 80-and-older group seem pretty good . <p> Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " McKeague told Quick Hits . " The competition ends about at 80 . " <p> Understandably so . How many people  --  regardless of age  --  are inclined to swim 1.2 miles , bicycle 56 miles and run 13.1 miles ? His winning time in 2006 was 6:57:49 . <p> So how did the event 's oldest participant become involved ? <p> " I was doing the shorter stuff like the Chicago Sun-Times triathlon , " he said . " And then 10 years ago , at the behest of some of my friends , I decided to do Ironman . " <p> So he must be something of a fitness freak . <p> " No , I 'm a competitive freak . " <p> A Lane Tech graduate , McKeague was not a high school athlete . <p> " I was too light and too short , " he said . " I was probably only about 5-4 , 118 pounds when I graduated from high school and went right into service at that time . I played golf for 50 years . Still do . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically 60 years old . " <p> Without outside competition , McKeague finds his driving  --  or swimming , cycling and running  --  force from within . <p> " Exactly , " he said . " When you do have somebody to compete against , it 's far more interesting . So , when you do n't , you have to come up with something that will motivate you . " <p> EX-BEAR FACTOR <p> BURRIS HAS 34 TDS CANADIAN <p> Where have you gone , Henry Burris ? A Bears nation turns its lonely eyes to you . <p> OK , maybe things are n't quite that bad , but for those who really want an answer to the question , try Canada . <p> That 's where the onetime Bears quarterback has taken his game . <p> He plays for the Canadian Football League Calgary Stampeders and has had a successful season , even though the team was 7-10-1 . He had a league-leading 34 touchdown passes ( as well as a league-leading 14 interceptions ) . <p> When the CFL recently announced its finalists for outstanding player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division nominee . <p> " Kerry 's a good friend of mine , and I 'm happy that he had a spectacular season , " Burris told Canadian media . " But if you look at the numbers and what a person needed to do to make it happen , I thought I did just that . <p> " Even though I missed three games with a shoulder injury , my numbers were still higher . So what does it take ? But , hey , I 'm happy for him . " <p> Saskatchewan went 12-6 in the regular season that ended Saturday . <p> " Truly , we thought somebody should be rewarded from the offensive side for the way we performed this year , " Burris said . " But I thought it might go to the guys who had a better record because , usually , that 's where it goes . " <p> Burris precisely on target ? It 's a concept unfamiliar to fans who remember his Bears performances . <p> QUOTEWORTHY
