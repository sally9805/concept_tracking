Section : Companies , People , Ideas A manufacturer of dreary commodity parts in a depressed economy is suddenly flush with success . How did Takenaka manufactory do it ? <p> THE TAKENAKA SEISAKUSHO CO. , in a suburb of Osaka , is like countless others amid Japan 's industrial belt . It consists of one small , single-story office building and two prefabricated shacks filled with machinery , where it makes nuts and bolts . Forget the Toyotas , Matsushitas and Canons for a moment . In places like this , the chusho kigyo ( small company ) sector accounts for most of Japan 's industrial activity and employs 60% of Japan 's labor force . Here , near the bottom of the industrial food chain , where workers have never enjoyed lifetime tenure , the Darwinian struggle in a transforming economy is as fierce as it gets . <p> That is not obvious at a glance . In the factory shacks is a scene reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin 's Modern Times . The heart of the operation is a chopping machine that slices nuts off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the office uniformed workers sit at rows of steel desks . One is manned by the president , Hirotada Takenaka , who does not have so much as a cubicle to separate him from his 165 employees . <p> The company was founded in 1935 to supply the fittings of battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy . " Totally devoted to screws , " remains its motto . Takenaka , 51 , inherited the business from his father and competes against 6,000 nut-and-bolt companies in Japan alone . It 's a $30 billion worldwide industry , but most of the Japanese makers have annual sales of less than $1 million . <p> Takenaka has a $25 million piece of this business . He dreams of going public and doubling revenues by 2005 . But he 's had to survive several near wipeouts . The closest call came in the late 1980s , when the value of the yen shot up . Just as Japanese boltmakers devastated American makers with cheap labor and heavy capital investment in the 1970s , new Asian competitors like China and Korea were invading Japan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million and losses totaled $13 million . <p> But Takenaka had already realized he had to do something to add value . He did something unheard-of in the industry  --  he set up his own R &D; department . Its mission : Build a better bolt . <p> After five years of research  --  quite frantic towards the end , as money began to dry up  --  his team came up with a superbolt . Coated with the company 's patented fluorocarbon polymer , it can resist seawater or the harsh environment of many industrial plants . While standard steel bolts show signs of corrosion after being immersed in seawater for 1,000 hours , and zinc-coated bolts do the same after 500 hours , Takenaka 's bolts last for 6,000 hours . They are priced at $10,000 to $12,000 a ton , similar to the price of steel bolts at the upper end of the quality range found in things like bridges and railroad cars . <p> But building a better bolt did n't have the world beating a path to his door . " I spent almost as much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Takenaka says . In the darkest days , he visited all his big clients , huge plant manufacturers like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , Kawasaki and Mitsui , trying to coax an order . <p> " Unlike the U.S. , Japan is a society where nobody wants to take responsibility , " he says . " Every time the same thing happened : I would spend six months convincing a junior official with technical data ; he would finally pass it on to his supervisor and so on for about three years , until it reached the desk of the general manager in charge of purchasing , who would then say no . " <p> Japanese had a hard time believing a small company could come up with something innovative . " Since everybody knew the old bolts rusted , you would not get in trouble for buying them , so why risk buying more expensive new bolts that might also end up rusting anyway ? " <p> Not one to give up , Takenaka flew to Houston , center of the global oil industry . He got an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through six months of trials , Exxon put Takenaka on its " master vendor list . " Desperate for nonrusting bolts for offshore oil rigs and plants , other oil majors soon followed . <p> Ironically , when Japanese plantmakers began bidding for oil-industry contracts in the early 1990s , like a $500 million Exxon/Petronas oil rig in Malaysia , they were given technical specs that called for Takenaka 's bolts . <p> " Suddenly , these guys who turned me down when I was begging for them to buy my bolts at cost $6,000 a ton came knocking on our door . I told them the price was now $12,000 a ton , and they all paid up . " <p> Since Takenaka 's success other boltmakers have made copycat versions but have been unable to master the tricky task of producing material that stays together under stress . <p> Sales really picked up after Takenaka convinced Japan 's construction ministry ( after two years of trying ) that his bolts were better for big public-works projects like tunnels . His products are pinning together the joints of white-elephant projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seto Bridge joining Shikoku in the south to the Japanese main island , was worth $1.5 million . Takenaka now has a lustful eye on the U.S. , where massive expenditures loom for repair of decades-old spans . <p> Whereas he once had to scavenge for qualified staff because a small bolt company was looked down on , today several heavy-industry giants are sending him some of their laid-off workers . " They send me employees and pay half their wages until they retire , " Takenaka says . <p> But not everyone in his industry has seen such a turn . " Most boltmakers , just like most companies , invested in too much capacity in the 1980s , and they still have it sitting idle , " he says . Their lobby group , the Fasteners Institute of Japan  --  staffed with ex-bureaucrats  --  is now asking the government to buy up excess capacity and to protect them from imports . <p> Competitors also hunger for Takenaka 's technology . Signs in Japanese and English warn that taking photographs in its facilities is strictly prohibited . Employees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't waiting for his rivals to catch up . He 's begun shifting from the business of selling metal parts to the business of selling anticorrosion coatings . And he made a crucial outside hire of his own . At a bar , he met an engineer from Fujitsu who had tired of managerial duties and wanted to create products again . Takenaka saw an opening in robot components . " I have lots of cash and this is the fastest growing part of the economy , so it made sense to invest there , " he says . So his new man is leading a push into high tech that is bringing in $4 million a year in sales . He also helped set up a home page : Takenaka-mfg.co.jp . <p> Turns out that Takenaka 's decision to bring R &D; to bolts was not so nuts after all . <p> Riveting Stocks : The American Boltmakers <p> Despite intense competition from lower-cost foreign competitors , some publicly traded domestic manufacturers still have significant nuts-and-bolts lines .
