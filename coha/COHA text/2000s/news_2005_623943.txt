<p> Yeager-meister : A powwow gathered for artist Ira Yeager at his famed Shotwell Street gallery , where the exhibition " Indian Paintings : 40 Years " celebrated Yeager 's American Indian series . <p> The solemn , dignified visages practically popped off the walls of the long-beloved studio ( site of numerous memorable dinner parties ) , bursting with drama , vibrant color and intricately rendered adornment . <p> Longtime friends and fans ( both of city and valley vintage ) stopped by to congratulate Ira , including Austin Hills , the sparkling Jamie Schramsberg , Zinfandel king K.R. Rombauer , Diane and Matthew Kelly , Deborah McMicking , printmaker Peter Koch and Susan Filter , Stephanie and Bill McColl , Winnie Noble , Merces Freeman , and Clarke and Elizabeth Swanson and two of their daughters , Alexis and Claiborne . <p> And , of course , members of Ira 's loyal posse : George Hellyer and Gail Glasser and her husband , Dr. Harvey Glasser . <p> " This series is very special , " said Adria Bini , there with her son and daughter-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , they take on a life of their own . " <p> Yeager grew up in the Pacific Northwest , where his sportsman father led hunting trips , sometimes accompanied by Indians . <p> The series coalesced when Yeager moved to New Mexico in the ' 60s , set up a studio and found himself drawn to the native culture there . <p> " This series has continued and continues to evolve because it comes from inside me  --  the pain , the strength , " said Yeager , between hugs . " These come from my own hopes and dreams  --  a glimpse , of sorts , inside the true self . " <p> Many at the show already possessed at least one Yeager " Indian , " including Mark Cooley and his wife , Joan . <p> " We love ours . We often just stop in front of the painting and stare , " said Joan . " Tonight Mark 's thinking maybe it 's time to bring home a friend for it . " <p> Come fly with me : Just in time for the holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and landed rather well . <p> Ken Moore , previously here with Bulgari and Cartier and following a recent stint in New York , where he managed Boucheron and David Yurman , now takes over the helm of Hermes . <p> To celebrate , longtime pals ( to each other and Ken ) Lisa Goldman and Sako Fisher hosted a lunch in his honor at the Rotunda Restaurant at Neiman Marcus . And the talented and fashionable hostesses scored Swells ' first ever " best invitation " commendation for their clever creativity . <p> Iconic Hermes ' boxes were delivered to guests , who discovered that they contained a handcrafted invitation trimmed with a Hermes classic brown logo ribbon and printed in orange ink . <p> " I 'm just the lackey , " said Sako as she toasted Ken with a glass of champagne ( specially ordered by Jane Wolf ) . " Lisa tells me what to do , and I do it . " <p> Co-host Lisa called Sako in Paris , instructing her to go to Hermes and bring home 36 boxes  --  and 300 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ship in order to surprise Ken . <p> Among the gal pals and Hermes fans : Lisa 's mother , Eleanor Myers , Lisa Pritzker , Lynn Millhouse , Cynthia Coolidge , Maria Manetti Farrow , Deborah Minor , Allison Speer , Daniela Faggioli , O.J. Shansby , Theo Schwabacher , Leigh Matthes and Maria Muzio . <p> You could n't have swung a cat down the length of the long luncheon table ( swathed in orange , natch , and adorned with one long row of Flowers Claire Marie vibrant orange tulips and roses ) without hitting a Birkin bag . Or a Kelly . Or an exquisite print scarf . <p> But leave it to Tatiana Sorokko , a Harper 's Bazaar contributing editor and committed fashionista , who managed to out-Kelly every lady there . She is , perhaps , the only Bay Area resident who possesses the Kelly Shearling bag , specially created by Hermes ' designer Jean Paul Gaultier . <p> " I was at the shows in New York , and the minute I saw that bag on the runway , I called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wait list , " said Sorokko . " Gaultier only made 100 of them . And only one was allotted to the boutique here . " <p> Ken teased that he 'd wanted to slip the coveted mini-Birkin into each of the tiny Hermes gift bags . But guests did happily tote home a vase of the flowers and a bottle of Hermes ' Eau de Merveilles . <p> " I feel like I 've won the lotto , " said Moore , beaming . " I 'm back in San Francisco , and I get to work for Hermes . It does n't get much better than that . " <p> Amen , and pass the Birkins . <p> Getty a-go-go : Philanthropist and designer Ann Getty traveled to China with the recent San Francisco delegation led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Mayor Gavin Newsom . <p> But no politician , she . The interior and furniture designer met with clients along the way . <p> " I 'm really pleased to have the few clients in Asia I do have , because they are willing to experiment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Associates firm operates out of the Presidio . " The Asian aesthetic is still timid with color . The favored color is ' beige '  --  usually something white and something less white . " <p> The decor trend there seems to be moving away from very little furniture to a blend of modernism and formality , a look she 's dubbed Italian Modern . But Getty likes a pillow or two to plump . <p> " I 'm going slow with my clients , adding a comfortable sofa and club chairs from my House line to mix with their traditional pieces . " <p> Getty 's own aesthetic has long been inspired by an Asian crosscurrent : " The Asian influence has been with us since the era of Louis XIV , especially ' chinoiserie ' and Ming furniture . Ming is all about subtle details , such as the curve of the leg on a chair . If you study it for even a moment , it 's a style anyone would love . " <p> Between international forays , Getty is still working on the old Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getty , for him and his wife , Jacqui Getty . But the move-in date is a ways away , especially as they just discovered a few pesky structural problems . <p> In the meantime , the Asian economy is growing by leaps and bounds , especially across the river from Shanghai in Pudong province , which Getty jokes is sort of like San Jose . But not quite as far . <p> " I get daily e-mail updates from my friend Shelly , who lives there and is always telling me , ' Get over here  --  they 're building tract houses like crazy ! ' <p> " Like here , the tracts are named . Some reflect the culture , such as Plum Blossom . But a lot have names like Malibu Sunset and Rancho Santa Fe . " <p> By the time Ann Getty &; Associates finishes working its magic , there may even be a Pudong tract named " Getty-wood . " <p> Double-C : Chanel and CX , the Contemporary Extension auxiliary for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , joined forces with Vanity Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boutique on Maiden Lane . <p> Hipsters and glamour gals circled around displays in which modern works created by local artists ( Mark Paron , Nancy Youdelman , Cara Alhadeff , Walter Robinson ) were sprinkled , some even paying clever homage to the famed double-C . <p> For Chanel manager Anne Wagner , the setting and crowd mixed perfectly : " Tonight is a wonderful intersection of fashion and art . " <p> Upstairs hung photographs by Alhadeff , whose work was recently exhibited at the Art Basel Miami art fair . She is also featured in SFMOMA 's collection and Artists Gallery Exhibition , " Photography 2005 , " which runs through end of the month at Fort Mason . <p> Both a photographer and a performance artist , Alhadeff 's work incorporates a moody vision of male and female nudes , which she shoots locally in theatrical settings , including a series at the Red Room on Sutter Street of naked pregnant women . No customers , nor their cocktails , were disturbed  --  the bar was booked during off hours . <p> The photos at Chanel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhancement was involved . But it 's all straight film : " Reality is peculiar enough , " said Alhadeff , with a laugh . " We do n't need to add any more with digital manipulation . " <p> However , a little manipulation is n't all bad . And for those of us who obsess over such things , beauty counter manager Venice Goodman revealed that Shanghai Red reigns as the best-selling lipstick shade on Maiden Lane . <p> Guests received fab departing gifts  --  bottles of " His " and " Her " Chanel scents ( Allure Homme and Un Fleur ) and a copy of " The Proust Questionnaire , " the famous naval-gazing list of responses by celebs that appears monthly in Vanity Fair and includes such questions as " What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery ? " <p> Here at Swells Inc. we know just the answer : an empty bottle of Chanel No. 5 . <p>  --  ( 1-5 ) Yeager-meister : 1 A gallery party celebrated the " Indian Paintings " exhibition , a 40-year retrospective of this series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local madman , lost in thought . 3 Gail Glasser models her treasured leather jacket , which sports a Yeager original . 4 George Hellyer , gentleman , scholar and author , recently celebrated at the gallery , too , with a book-signing party for his memoir , " In Calypso 's Thrall : An American 's Decade in a Greek Village .
