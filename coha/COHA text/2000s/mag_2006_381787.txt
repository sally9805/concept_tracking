The English-mangling , sister-snogging , horse-urine-drinking ( and fictional ) Kazakh journalist played by British comedian SACHA BARON COHEN is on the wackiest publicity tour in history for his movie Borat . Last week he caused a minor security kerfuffle when he tried to personally deliver a screening invitation to " President George Walter Bush .
