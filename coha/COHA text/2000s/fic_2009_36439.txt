day 18 without Abby <p> <p> There 's a thud as her little body collides with the steel fender . No scream . Just a soft sigh , a surprised breath inhaled as she 's lifted from the ground only to be returned there . I hear it happen . I see it happen . And I was n't even there . <p> <p> Like the other twelve mornings I 'd driven Abby to preschool , she skipped out to the minivan . Her backpack slung over her shoulders . It was so wide her little head of curls stuck up like a turtle 's out of its shell . The only sound I heard that sun- drenched morning was her chirpy voice telling me to hurry . It was too early in the season to hear discarded leaves under her feet , though I would n't have heard them anyway . She was wearing her new ballet slippers , the ones she 'd worn every day since I 'd bought them for back- to- school . The ride to Bright Futures Preschool was only seven minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd start the day indoors or out . Neither of us could 've known that the light kiss and fleeting hug she gave me outside the gate of the playground would be our last . <p> <p> I 've gone over and over every detail of that morning , thinking if only I 'd kept her home because of those sniffles , or if only it was my day to volunteer . Maybe if I had changed one single thing about that morning , life would be different now . <p> <p> I ca n't see how writing about it will help , but Celia says it will . My first therapy appointment was yesterday . I gripped the railing as I made my way down the steps of my farmer 's porch ; it was my first time out in two weeks . In seconds , I realized my capri pants and flip- flops were geared to the weather before  --  not to the crisp fall air that hit me in the shins as I walked to my van . I did n't have the energy to change . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's seat , which was positioned too far back for my legs . The van was cleaner on the inside than it had been in months . Ethan must have been the last to drive my Voyager , which no longer has a car seat . I reached under the seat to pull it forward , and my hand felt the stiff body of a plastic ballerina , the one Abby had been looking for weeks ago . <p> <p> I held the tiny dancer to my chest and drove one town over to talk to a stranger about my life without Abby . Ethan wants me to see Celia . He says it is n't normal to sleep in Abby 's bed , to surround myself with her baby blanket and stuffed bunny . I do n't care what 's normal . It is n't normal to lose the only child you have or ever will have . It is n't normal for someone to run down a four-year- old outside her preschool and not stop to help her , or tell her mother why this had to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> <p> day 20 without Abby <p> <p> Last night I slept more than two hours ; I set a new record , three and a half . I wish I had n't slept that long because when I woke up in Abby 's bed , clutching Tootsie Rabbit , it took me a few seconds to remember . I was n't in her bed because I 'd fallen asleep reading " Wynken , Blynken and Nod , " or because I 'd comforted her back to sleep after a bad dream . No , this was my nightmare . <p> <p> I hate myself for forgetting for a single second . I 'm afraid if I could forget for a few seconds , maybe someday I 'll forget for a few minutes , or even a few hours . I do n't want to forget . <p> <p> I slipped out of her bed and smoothed the wrinkles I 'd made . I tucked the sheets , blanket , and spread under the mattress , instead of letting them hang to the rug . The new way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to make one small change in her room in hopes I could trap Abby 's smell between the covers . <p> <p> At the second- floor landing , there was no need to peek into my bedroom . The hallway was filled with visible dust motes , and the smell of coffee brewing told me Ethan was already up . My choices were limited . I could creep back into Abby 's warm bed . There I could concentrate on the ache in my gut that came in waves every time I looked at the clouds I 'd painted on her walls while pregnant . Or I could brave the frigid weather downstairs . I chose to drag myself down the uneven steps , trying to think of something to say to Ethan . In a matter of weeks , our conversations had gone from breezy to bleak . <p> <p> He sat staring out the kitchen window , all expression washed from his face . He looked like a different person without the smile that reaches his eyes . After pouring myself a cup , I lightly brushed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there , and sat across from him . <p> <p> " Do you ever forget , even for a minute ? " I asked . <p> <p> Now his eyes were deep in the bottom of his cup . " Not yet . " He took a sip and put it down . <p> <p> I did n't ask him if he wants to . I think he does . I 'll never forget . I 'd rather be pierced by the sword at the sound of her name than forget . Abigail Anna Gray . <p> <p> " Did you sleep ? " he asked . He reached one hand over to my side of the table . " I missed you in bed . " <p> <p> I brought my cup to my lips , desperate to avoid his touch . " A little . Are n't you going to work ? " Dressed in navy pinstripes , I knew he was . I thought I could sidestep our new sleeping arrangement by changing the subject . <p> <p> " I 'm going to the police station first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with me ? I could drop you back here before I head to work . " His irresistible blue eyes begged me . <p> <p> I sat up . " Did Caulfield call ? I did n't hear the phone ring . " Ethan leaned back hard against his chair . His shoulder slump told me what I was sick to death of hearing . <p> <p> " No , Detective Caulfield did n't call , " he said . " The last time I talked to him he said he was going to finish the interviews with the people on Beach Rose and the teachers , and then call us . That was four days ago . " <p> <p> I did n't miss Ethan correcting me for leaving out the word detective  --  as if I considered the one we got assigned anything but another stroke of unlucky . <p> <p> I 'd met Detective Hollis Caulfield only once , but once was enough to know I did n't like him . His ju nior officers beat him to our house to tell us an investigation into Abby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to my kitchen on his one- and-only visit . One that had to be protocol , since he had nothing to add to what we already knew before he got here . <p> <p> No one saw what happened . <p> <p> Three days after Abby died , Caulfield , in a blazer that did n't cover even a third of his bulk , hauled himself through my antique Cape . My house that had once been a home was filled with the sights , sounds , and smells of tragedy . Teary neighbors holding apple squares and crumpled tissues crowded our family room and kitchen . He gave them sideways glances , right and then left , over a pair of half- moon glasses parked low on his nose , as if he 'd expected them to clear a path for him without even the hint of a polite excuse me . The din fell to a hush as everyone realized he was n't a prince of a guy . Caulfield was police . I knew right then that he was a royal pain . <p> <p> Ethan topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with him to the station . <p> <p> " No , you go without me . I did n't sleep so much that I have the energy to shower , get dressed , and deal with him . If it 's okay with you , I 'll stay here . He does n't tick you off like he does me , and he 'll probably tell you more . He strikes me as a lady hater . " <p> <p> " I hate when you do that . " Ethan turned his back on me , putting the pot back on the burner . <p> <p> " What ? " I asked . " Come on , you can tell inside of five seconds he 's a man 's man . He does n't look me in the eyes when he 's talking , and he directed all the answers to my questions to you . He called me the wife , for God 's sake . " <p> <p> " So he 's tough , you do n't have to assume the worst . You 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Back when we finished each other 's sentences , one of us would 've rounded out the conversation with a joke . Some kind of you know how Tessa can be remark . Instead Ethan , the diplomat , finished it with , " Okay ? " <p> <p> I did n't like Caulfield . I was n't going to promise not to provoke him . I would if I had to . All I was willing to agree to was a cease- fire with Ethan . " That 's why it 's better if I stay home . You go . Come back here and tell me what he says  --  if you want . " It was the best I had to offer . <p> <p> Our eyes were drawn to the movement outside the kitchen window . A squirrel pranced along the long limb of our maple tree . When he got to the rope that held Abby 's tire swing , he jumped to avoid its knot . <p> <p> Ethan leaned over to kiss my cheek . " I will . " <p> <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd left me . I was drinking cold coffee . <p> <p> " You really should eat something , you 're going to get an ulcer . " He opened one of the four bakery boxes on the counter and handed me a day- old muffin with a paper napkin covered with smiley faces . <p> <p> " Caulfield pushed me off again . I ca n't believe this is taking so long . He said the interviews are n't done . He 's waiting for the crime scene evidence to be processed . " Ethan swallowed . " And the autopsy results . " <p> <p> The one- two punch made by the three words crime scene evidence paled in comparison to the single blow that came with the word autopsy . <p> <p> " I know . Wenonah Falls is hardly Boston . " I started talking because thinking about a monster in a sedan was preferable to seeing Abby on a cold metal table . <p> <p> " He should 've solved this in a couple of days , whether someone saw something or not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pajama top of Ethan 's I was wearing . <p> <p> " There would n't be anything to solve if it were n't for Abby 's teacher , " he said . " I still ca n't wrap my mind around the fact that she did n't count the kids on the way back from the playground . " He tried to beat the wrinkles out of his suit coat with his hand . <p> <p> I pictured Miss Janie with her perfect posture and her indoor voice saying it was only a matter of minutes between the time she came inside Bright Futures and the time she went back out and found Abby in the street . <p> <p> Abby must have been dawdling , getting farther from the rest of the kids . She was probably humming and did n't hear her teacher say it was time to go back in . She must 've seen a flower she wanted , or maybe she found a blue jay 's feather . She always collected things , and she treated each thing like treasure . It 's hard to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abby does n't have a bright future . I do n't have a bright future . <p> <p> " Tessa , honey , are you okay ? " Ethan removed my fingers one by one from the muffin I crumbled into smaller and smaller pieces . He brought me back to the kitchen , where we had n't had an uninterrupted cup of coffee in four years . <p> <p> " So what else did Caulfield say ? Do n't tell me that 's it . " <p> <p> " He said he 'll call us when all the evidence is processed , and he 'll respond to anything new that comes in , but for now this is where things stand . He told me we have to be patient . We just have to wait . " <p> <p> Even as I did it , I knew I should n't be yelling at Ethan . He should 've known the words patient and wait are sticks of chalk squealing down the length of a blackboard . <p> <p> " That 's easy for him to say , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? I want him to check every car in town . I want him to get out there and find who drove a three- thousand-pound weapon over my thirty- two- pound daughter . " <p> <p> In two staccato beats , Ethan put his elbows up on the table and rested his head in his hands . <p> <p> day 22 without Abby <p> <p> Rosemary and Matthew came over this morning . She knows Wednesdays are the hardest day of the week . It 's been three weeks since Abby took her last breath . <p> <p> I was in Abby 's room replaying different scenarios in my mind , still trying to figure out how the accident really happened . I hate the word , accident . An accident is when you drop a plate or glass , not kill a child . I spend most of every day sitting in the rocking chair by her window . From there , just about everything is the same . When I get tired of sitting , I walk around and touch her things , and hold them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Tangles , part Country Apple body lotion . Her dresses hang in her closet ready to wear . Today , I would 've chosen the indigo jersey dress with the little daisies because the three- quarter-length sleeves keep her warm on cool days . I picture myself slipping it over her curly head , and then down over her bony shoulders and slim waist . I 'd insist on tights . She 'd fuss over the seams . Then we 'd head down to the kitchen where she 'd eat her Rice Krispies with three blackberries , while I 'd drink my coffee and read The Runaway Bunny . <p> <p> Rosemary tried to pull me out of my trance with her cheery mood and fresh blueberry bread . She wore pencil thin slacks , without a single wrinkle , and an electric blue V-neck , off the rack at Lord &amp; Taylor . Rosemary is slightly taller than me , as dark as I am light . Her neat outfit the opposite of my stained sweatpants and sweatshirt . We 've been compared for our contrasting looks all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rosemary looked just right , like always , and I looked like something was dreadfully wrong . <p> <p> I never used to mind her dropping by . Now I 'm sick of her pushing me to eat and get dressed , two of a million things I do n't feel like doing . <p> <p> " Come on , Snow . You 'll feel better if you take a tub and change . I 'll run your bath , and lay out some clean clothes . Okay ? " <p> <p> Really reaching , she dug up my childhood nickname . The only thing Daddy left behind . He called me Snow White and her Rose Red , his way of identifying his daughters born two years apart . <p> <p> Rosemary looked around , her eyes settled on the miniature stroller that held Dolly . " I do n't think you should spend so much time in here . " The still life of my daughter 's room pulled tears from her lids . " Why do n't we go for a walk ? " She wiped one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you good to get out in the fresh air . " <p> <p> " Stop it , " I said . " A bath and a walk are n't going to make everything all better . It does n't matter what I eat , or what I wear . " I wanted to shout , she 's dead , but I saw Matthew playing on the floor with one of Abby 's horses . <p> <p> I love Rosemary , but when she 's over I 'm always on the verge of screaming . She treats me like a fragile heirloom . Does n't she know I am the delicate vase that has already fallen off the mantel into a million pieces on the floor ? I ca n't break any more . I hate the look on her face that says , thank God this did n't happen to me . She does n't know I see it . She keeps it hard to find . I 've seen it so blatantly on every other mother 's face that I could recognize it through any mask a mother chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate : I hate when she brings Matthew , and I hate when she leaves him at home . When he 's here , I 'm mad because her baby 's alive . When she does n't bring him , I 'm angry because she does n't think I can handle seeing a mother with her child . Perfect Rosemary with her perfect Matthew . <p> <p> Matthew did n't mind spending time with me in Abby 's room . He patted the mane of one of her horses , as he crawled into my lap . " Auntie Tessa , where 's Abby ? I want her to come home . " <p> <p> Rosemary sat down on the end of Abby 's bed , still holding her stupid bread . I buried my face in Matthew 's neck . My skin tingled all over from the pressure of holding on to a real child . I was proud of Matthew for asking about his cousin , for saying how he felt , right out loud . He was n't tiptoeing around it . He misses her and wants her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without Summer by Lynne Griffin . Copyright 2009 by Lynne Griffin .
