It came by mail , regular postage , the old-fashioned way since the Judge was almost eighty and distrusted modern devices . Forget e-mail and even faxes . He did n't use an answering machine and had never been fond of the telephone . He pecked out his letters with both index fingers , one feeble key at a time , hunched over his old Underwood manual on a rolltop desk under the portrait of Nathan Bedford Forrest . The Judge 's grandfather had fought with Forrest at Shiloh and throughout the Deep South , and to him no figure in history was more revered . For thirty-two years , the Judge had quietly refused to hold court on July 13 , Forrest 's birthday . It came with another letter , a magazine , and two invoices , and was routinely placed in the law school mailbox of Professor Ray Atlee . He recognized it immediately since such envelopes had been a part of his life for as long as he could remember . It was from his father , a man he too called the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should open it right there or wait a moment . Good news or bad , he never knew with the Judge , though the old man was dying and good news had been rare . It was thin and appeared to contain only one sheet of paper ; nothing unusual about that . The Judge was frugal with the written word , though he 'd once been known for his windy lectures from the bench . It was a business letter , that much was certain . The Judge was not one for small talk , hated gossip and idle chitchat , whether written or spoken . Ice tea with him on the porch would be a refighting of the Civil War , probably at Shiloh , where he would once again lay all blame for the Confederate defeat at the shiny , untouched boots of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard , a man he would hate even in heaven , if by chance they met there . He 'd be dead soon . Seventy-nine years old with cancer in his stomach . He was overweight , a diabetic , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived three attacks , and a host of lesser ailments that had tormented him for twenty years and were now finally closing in for the kill . The pain was constant . During their last phone call three weeks earlier , a call initiated by Ray because the Judge thought long distance was a rip-off , the old man sounded weak and strained . They had talked for less than two minutes . The return address was gold-embossed : Chancellor Reuben V. Atlee , 25th Chancery District , Ford County Courthouse , Clanton , Mississippi . Ray slid the envelope into the magazine and began walking . Judge Atlee no longer held the office of chancellor . The voters had retired him nine years earlier , a bitter defeat from which he would never recover . Thirty-two years of diligent service to his people , and they tossed him out in favor of a younger man with radio and television ads . The Judge had refused to campaign . He claimed he had too much work to do , and , more important , the people knew him well and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His strategy had seemed arrogant to many . He carried Ford County but got shellacked in the other five . It took three years to get him out of the courthouse . His office on the second floor had survived a fire and had missed two renovations . The Judge had not allowed them to touch it with paint or hammers . When the county supervisors finally convinced him that he had to leave or be evicted , he boxed up three decades ' worth of useless files and notes and dusty old books and took them home and stacked them in his study . When the study was full , he lined them down the hallways into the dining room and even the foyer . Ray nodded to a student who was seated in the hall . Outside his office , he spoke to a colleague . Inside , he locked the door behind him and placed the mail in the center of his desk . He took off his jacket , hung it on the back of the door , stepped over a stack of thick law books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then to himself uttered his daily vow to organize the place . The room was twelve by fifteen , with a small desk and a small sofa , both covered with enough work to make Ray seem like a very busy man . He was not . For the spring semester he was teaching one section of antitrust . And he was supposed to be writing a book , another drab , tedious volume on monopolies that would be read by no one but would add handsomely to his pedigree . He had tenure , but like all serious professors he was ruled by the " publish or perish " dictum of academic life . He sat at his desk and shoved papers out of the way . The envelope was addressed to Professor N. Ray Atlee , University of Virginia School of Law , Charlottesville , Virginia . The e 's and o 's were smudged together . A new ribbon had been needed for a decade . The Judge did n't believe in zip codes either . The N was for Nathan , after the general , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been over the son 's decision to drop Nathan altogether and plow through life simply as Ray . The Judge 's letters were always sent to the law school , never to his son 's apartment in downtown Charlottesville . The Judge liked titles and important addresses , and he wanted folks in Clanton , even the postal workers , to know that his son was a professor of law . It was unnecessary . Ray had been teaching ( and writing ) for thirteen years , and those who mattered in Ford County knew it . He opened the envelope and unfolded a single sheet of paper . It too was grandly embossed with the Judge 's name and former title and address , again minus the zip code . The old man probably had an unlimited supply of the stationery . It was addressed to both Ray and his younger brother , Forrest , the only two offspring of a bad marriage that had ended in 1969 with the death of their mother . As always , the message was brief : Please make arrangements to appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m. , to discuss the administration of my estate . Sincerely , Reuben V. Atlee . The distinctive signature had shrunk and looked unsteady . For years it had been emblazoned across orders and decrees that had changed countless lives . Decrees of divorce , child custody , termination of parental rights , adoptions . Orders settling will contests , election contests , land disputes , annexation fights . The Judge 's autograph had been authoritative and well known ; now it was the vaguely familiar scrawl of a very sick old man . Sick or not , though , Ray knew that he would be present in his father 's study at the appointed time . He had just been summoned , and as irritating as it was , he had no doubt that he and his brother would drag themselves before His Honor for one more lecture . It was typical of the Judge to pick a day that was convenient for him without consulting anybody else . It was the nature of the Judge , and perhaps most judges for that matter , to set dates for hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such heavy-handedness was learned and even required when dealing with crowded dockets , reluctant litigants , busy lawyers , lazy lawyers . But the Judge had run his family in pretty much the same manner as he 'd run his courtroom , and that was the principal reason Ray Atlee was teaching law in Virginia and not practicing it in Mississippi . He read the summons again , then put it away , on top of the pile of current matters to deal with . He walked to the window and looked out at the courtyard where everything was in bloom . He was n't angry or bitter , just frustrated that his father could once again dictate so much . But the old man was dying , he told himself . Give him a break . There would n't be many more trips home . The Judge 's estate was cloaked with mystery . The principal asset was the house  --  an antebellum hand-me-down from the same Atlee who 'd fought with General Forrest . On a shady street in old Atlanta it would be worth over a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of five neglected acres three blocks off the town square . The floors sagged , the roof leaked , paint had not touched the walls in Ray 's lifetime . He and his brother could sell it for perhaps a hundred thousand dollars , but the buyer would need twice that to make it livable . Neither would ever live there ; in fact , Forrest had not set foot in the house in many years . The house was called Maple Run , as if it were some grand estate with a staff and a social calendar . The last worker had been Irene the maid . She 'd died four years earlier and since then no one had vacuumed the floors or touched the furniture with polish . The Judge paid a local felon twenty dollars a week to cut the grass , and he did so with great reluctance . Eighty dollars a month was robbery , in his learned opinion . When Ray was a child , his mother referred to their home as Maple Run . They never had dinners at their home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlees on Fourth Street , but instead it was Maple Run on Fourth Street . Few other folks in Clanton had names for their homes . She died from an aneurysm and they laid her on a table in the front parlor . For two days the town stopped by and paraded across the front porch , through the foyer , through the parlor for last respects , then to the dining room for punch and cookies . Ray and Forrest hid in the attic and cursed their father for tolerating such a spectacle . That was their mother lying down there , a pretty young woman now pale and stiff in an open coffin . Forrest had always called it Maple Ruin . The red and yellow maples that once lined the street had died of some unknown disease . Their rotted stumps had never been cleared . Four huge oaks shaded the front lawn . They shed leaves by the ton , far too many for anyone to rake and gather . And at least twice a year the oaks would lose a branch that would fall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not get removed . The house stood there year after year , decade after decade , taking punches but never falling . It was still a handsome house , a Georgian with columns , once a monument to those who 'd built it , and now a sad reminder of a declining family . Ray wanted nothing to do with it . For him the house was filled with unpleasant memories and each trip back depressed him . He certainly could n't afford the financial black hole of maintaining an estate that ought to be bulldozed . Forrest would burn it before he owned it . The Judge , however , wanted Ray to take the house and keep it in the family . This had been discussed in vague terms over the past few years . Ray had never mustered the courage to ask , " What family ? " He had no children . There was an ex-wife but no prospect of a current one . Same for Forrest , except he had a dizzying collection of ex-girlfriends and a current housing arrangement with Ellie , a three-hundred-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biological miracle that Forrest had produced no children , but so far none had been discovered . The Atlee bloodline was thinning to a sad and inevitable halt , which did n't bother Ray at all . He was living life for himself , not for the benefit of his father or the family 's glorious past . He returned to Clanton only for funerals . The Judge 's other assets had never been discussed . The Atlee family had once been wealthy , but long before Ray . There had been land and cotton and slaves and railroads and banks and politics , the usual Confederate portfolio of holdings that , in terms of cash , meant nothing in the late twentieth century . It did , however , bestow upon the Atlees the status of " family money . " By the time Ray was ten he knew his family had money . His father was a judge and his home had a name , and in rural Mississippi this meant he was indeed a rich kid . Before she died his mother did her best to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They lived in a mansion . They were Presbyterians . They vacationed in Florida , every third year . They occasionally went to the Peabody Hotel in Memphis for dinner . Their clothes were nicer . Then Ray was accepted at Stanford . His bubble burst when the Judge said bluntly , " I ca n't afford it . " " What do you mean ? " Ray had asked . " I mean what I said . I ca n't afford Stanford . " " But I do n't understand . " " Then I 'll make it plain . Go to any college you want . But if you go to Sewanee , then I 'll pay for it . " Ray went to Sewanee , without the baggage of family money , and was supported by his father , who provided an allowance that barely covered tuition , books , board , and fraternity dues . Law school was at Tulane , where Ray survived by waiting tables at an oyster bar in the French Quarter . For thirty-two years , the Judge had earned a chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . While at Tulane Ray read a report on judicial compensation , and he was saddened to learn that Mississippi judges were earning fifty-two thousand dollars a year when the national average was ninety-five thousand . The Judge lived alone , spent little on the house , had no bad habits except for his pipe , and he preferred cheap tobacco . He drove an old Lincoln , ate bad food but lots of it , and wore the same black suits he 'd been wearing since the fifties . His vice was charity . He saved his money , then he gave it away . No one knew how much money the Judge donated annually . An automatic ten percent went to the Presbyterian Church . Sewanee got two thousand dollars a year , same for the Sons of Confederate Veterans . Those three gifts were carved in granite . The rest were not . Judge Atlee gave to anyone who would ask . A crippled child in need of crutches . An all-star team traveling to a state tournament . A drive by the Rotary Club to vaccinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cats in Ford County . A new roof for Clanton 's only museum . The list was endless , and all that was necessary to receive a check was to write a short letter and ask for it . Judge Atlee always sent money and had been doing so ever since Ray and Forrest left home . Ray could see him now , lost in the clutter and dust of his rolltop , pecking out short notes on his Underwood and sticking them in his chancellor 's envelopes with scarcely readable checks drawn on the First National Bank of Clanton  --  fifty dollars here , a hundred dollars there , a little for everyone until it was all gone . The estate would not be complicated because there would be so little to inventory . The ancient law books , threadbare furniture , painful family photos and mementos , long forgotten files and papers  --  all a bunch of rubbish that would make an impressive bonfire . He and Forrest would sell the house for whatever it might bring and be quite happy to salvage anything from the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but those calls were always easy to put off . Forrest was a different set of issues and problems , much more complicated than a dying , reclusive old father hell-bent on giving away his money . Forrest was a living , walking disaster , a boy of thirty-six whose mind had been deadened by every legal and illegal substance known to American culture . What a family , Ray mumbled to himself . He posted a cancellation for his eleven o'clock class , and went for therapy .
