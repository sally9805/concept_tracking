By the 1890s , San Francisco was an entirely different city from the one Mrs. Radford had left behind . The streets were paved . The sand was landscaped . Cable cars ran up and down Nob Hill . The Railroad Kings were old or dead , and also the Bonanza Kings , and also the Lawyer Kings . Society had arrived and settled , its standards strictly maintained by Ned " I would rather see my sister dead than waltzing " Greenway . Fashionable women belonged to the Conservative Set , the Fast Set , the Smart Set , the Serious Set , the Very Late at Night Set , or the highly respectable Dead Slow Set . There were still many more men than women in the city . This imbalance resulted in a high percentage of unrequited passions . Afflicted men consoled themselves with horse racing , graft , and most frequently , liquor . Any woman whose nerves did not compel her to depend on Lydia Pinkham 's Vegetable Compound ( alcohol , dandelion , chamomile , and licorice ) or Jayne 's Carminative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( opium and ipecac ) could count on the advantage of sobriety in her dealings with men . The destabilizing effects of widespread heartache combined with widespread drunkenness were somewhat alleviated by the rigging of local elections . The city was propelled in equal parts by drunken abuse and sober recompense . In those days every steamer that docked in San Francisco Bay was fitted with a large box . Each box was the samepinewood , a sizable slot edged with brass , and the words " Give to the Ladies ' Relief and Protection Society Home " burned in a circle about it . After the wreck ofthe SS Rio de Janeiro , one of these boxes was found floating past Alcatraz Island , and miraculously , the money was still inside . When levered open , the box contained rubles and yen , lire and pesos , all shuffled together like cards . Successive treasurers for the Society counted out coins stamped with the profiles of queens they could n't name and birds they 'd never seen . Some of the coins were worn so thin there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue remaining as to its history or origin . Occasionally during rough seas someone would donate a holy medallion , usually Saint Christopher . One box held a single amethyst earring with a small drop pearl . It was still charity , it was still begging , but it bore the semblance of adventure . Lizzie Hayes wore one of the more puzzling coins on a chain around her neck , so whenever they looked at her , the people of San Francisco would be reminded that she needed their money . The coin was imprinted with a mermaid curled into a circle , her hair so wide and wild it netted the tip of her own tail . If anyone asked , Lizzie said it was the currency of Atlantis . Lizzie Hayes had been a volunteer for the Ladies ' Relief Home for almost ten years , its treasurer for three . She had few intimate friends , but attended two churches , Grace Church and St. Luke 's Episcopal , which was good for her soul and also for fund-raising . In 1890 she was a spinster who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cupola one day in January , sorting through a box of donated books , when one of the older girls came to tell her Mrs. Mary E. Pleasant was at the door . " the front door , " the girl said . " She 'd like to speak to you . " Culling books was surprisingly dirty work , and Lizzie could feel a layer of grit on her hands and face . She wiped herself with her apron and went downstairs at once . She 'd never spoken with Mrs. Pleasant , never been in the same room with her , although two years earlier she 'd waited on an overloaded streetcar while the driver made an unscheduled stop so that Mrs. Pleasant could ride . Mrs. Pleasant walked the half-block to the car , and it seemed to Lizzie that she had walked as slowly as possible . She had given the driver an enormous , showy tip . Lizzie had also seen Mrs. Pleasant on occasion in her opulent Brewster buggy with its matched horses from the Stanford stables . Mrs. Pleasant dressed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery and a top hat , and also her own footman to attend her . If she had n't ever seen her , Lizzie would still have recognized Mrs. Pleasant 's face . It was one of the most famous in the city , appearing often in editorial cartoons , particularly in the Wasp . ( Although actually the last drawing had not used her face . Instead , a black crow had peered out from underneath Mrs. Pleasant 's habitual bonnet . ) " Now , I never cared a feather 's weight for public opinion , " Mrs. Pleasant had been once quoted as saying , " for it 's the ghostliest thing I ever did see . " It was fortunate she thought so . Here are just a few of the things people said about Mary Ellen Pleasant : She 'd buried three husbands before she turned forty , and in her sixties had still been the secret mistress of prominent and powerful men . At seventy years of age , she 'd looked no older than fifty . She had a small green snake tattooed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luster to pearls by wearing them . Although she worked as Thomas Bell 's housekeeper , she was as rich as a railroad magnate 's widow . Some of the city 's wealthiest men came to her for financial advice . Thomas Bell owed his entire fortune to her . She was an angel of charity . She had donated five thousand dollars of her own money to aid the victims of yellow fever during the epidemic in New Orleans . When she got to heaven , she would soon have the blessed organized and sending cups of cool water to the sinners below . She practiced voodoo and had once sunk a boat full of silver with a curse . She was a voodoo queen and the colored in San Francisco both worshipped and feared her . She could start and stop pregnancies ; she would , for a price , make a man die of love . She trafficked in prostitution and had a number of special white protges with whom her relationships were irregular , intimate , and possibly sapphic . She was responsible for all of poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ran a home for unwed mothers and secretly sold the infant girls to the Chinese tongs . She was the best cook in San Francisco . Here is what people said about Lizzie Hayes : She would have married William Fletcher if she could have got him . No one had asked Mrs. Pleasant into the parlor . Lizzie found her standing just inside the heavy oak door under the portrait of philanthropist Horace Hawes , with his brooding Lincolnesque looks . No one had offered to take her wrap , a bright purple shawl , which she nevertheless had removed and carried over one arm . Lizzie Hayes had not kept Mrs. Pleasant waiting , but neither had she taken off her work apron . Mrs. Pleasant was better dressed . She wore a skirt of polished black alpaca , a shirtwaist with a white collar , gold gypsy hoops through her ears , and her usual outdated Quaker bonnet , purple with a wide brim . She noticed the apron at once ; Lizzie saw her famous mismated eyes , one blue , one brown , flicker over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her skin was finely wrinkled , like crushed silk , and she smelled of lavender . There were no courteous preliminaries . " I 've brought you a girl , " Mrs. Pleasant said . She 'd come to California forty years earlier with the miners , but never lost the southern syrup of her vowels . " Named Jenny Ijub . She 's just off a boat from Panama . Her mother took sick on the voyage and was buried at sea . When I ask how old she is , she holds up all five fingers . Quiet little thing . She does n't seem to know her father . " One of her hands rested on the little girl 's hair . Mrs. Pleasant dipped her head as she talked , so her face was hidden by the bonnet brim . " I have my friends at the docks . I 'm known to care for such cases . " As her face vanished , her voice grew softer , more confiding . She knew how to make white people comfortable . She knew how to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lizzie felt the contrast between them . Mrs. Pleasant was tall , elegant , and spotless . Lizzie was short , dusty , fat as a toad . She was a person who rumpled , and not a person who rumpled attractively . She cleared her throat . " We have a waiting list . " Lizzie would have said this to anyone . It was the simple truth . So many in need . " And I 'd have to be certain of her age . She 's quite small . We do n't take children under four years . " " I 'll have to find somewhere else , then . " Mrs. Pleasant smiled down at Lizzie . It was an understanding smile . Seventy-some years old and Mrs. Pleasant still had all her own splendid teeth . She stooped a little and aimed her smile farther down . " Do n't you worry , Jenny . We 'll find someone who wants you . " Lizzie looked for the first time at the girl . She was dark-haired and sallow-skinned . She had sand on her shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home without picking up sand , but was otherwise as clean as could be . Neatly and simply dressed . Hatless , though someoneMrs . Pleasant ? had woven a bright bit of red ribbon into her hair . Her cheeks were flushed as if she were too warm , or embarrassed . She did not look up , but Lizzie imagined that if she could see the girl 's eyes they would be large and tragic . She held her back stiffly ; you could deduce the eyes from that . Lizzie hated saying no to anyone about anything . Saying no , however you disguised it , was a confession of your own limitations . Not only was it unhelpful , it was galling . She reached out and touched Jenny 's arm . " I have some discretion . Since she really has no one . We 'll find a bed somehow . Would you like to stay with us , Jenny ? " Jenny made no response . Her eyes were still lowered ; she had one knuckle firmly hooked behind her front teeth , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt . When Mrs. Pleasant was ready to leave , Jenny 's fingers would have to be pried apart . " That 's lovely , then , " said Mrs. Pleasant . " Now I know she 'll have the best of care . " " We might even find a family to take her . Be better if she had a bit of sparkle . Do n't put your fingers in your mouth , dear , " Lizzie said . She reached into her apron pocket and pulled out a silver bell . " This is how we call Matron , " she told Jenny . She rang the bell twice . " We have two Jennys already , but they are both much older than you . So we must call you Little Jenny . Shall we do that ? " The bell sounded very loud . Jenny 's fingers twisted inside Mrs. Pleasant 's skirt . Mrs. Pleasant knelt . She pulled a violet-hemmed handkerchief from her sleeve and wiped Jenny 's mouth with it . She had the face of a grandmother . " Listen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that I 'm your friend . I 'll send you a present soon so you 'll see I do n't forget you , either . " Mrs. Pleasant said these things quietly , intimately . It was not for the matron to hear , but she arrived just in time to do so . " I hope your present is something that can be shared , " the matron told Jenny as she took her away . " If you have things the others do n't , you ca n't expect them not to mind . " The matron was a fifty-year-old woman named Nell Harris . She had come to the Home as a charity case ; she had stayed on as an employee . She had soft-cooked features and a shifting seascape for a body . Her bosom lay on the swell of her stomach , rising and falling dramatically with her breath . Her most defining characteristic was that no one had ever made a good first impression on her . She took Jenny down to the kitchen and offered her a large slice of wholesome bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . The kitchen counters were piled with dishes , half clean , half not . Two girls in aprons were washing ; another was drying . That one smiled at Jenny and flicked her dishrag . The air was wet and warm and smelled of pork grease . " And that 's all it takes to make you think she 's nice as pie . She gave you away pretty fast , did n't she ? " Nell said .
